WALKER, JR., Circuit Judge:\n\n34        Defendant-Appellant Cablevision Systems Corporation\n\n35   (“Cablevision”) wants to market a new “Remote Storage” Digital\n\n36   Video Recorder system (“RS-DVR”), using a technology akin to both\n\n37   traditional, set-top digital video recorders, like TiVo (“DVRs”),\n\n38   and the video-on-demand (“VOD”) services provided by many cable\n\n39   companies.   Plaintiffs-Appellees produce copyrighted movies and\n\n40   television programs that they provide to Cablevision pursuant to\n\n41   numerous licensing agreements.    They contend that Cablevision,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f1    through the operation of its RS-DVR system as proposed, would\n\n2    directly infringe their copyrights both by making unauthorized\n\n3    reproductions, and by engaging in public performances, of their\n\n4    copyrighted works.   The material facts are not in dispute.\n\n5    Because we conclude that Cablevision would not directly infringe\n\n6    plaintiffs’ rights under the Copyright Act by offering its RS-DVR\n\n7    system to consumers, we reverse the district court’s award of\n\n8    summary judgment to plaintiffs, and we vacate its injunction\n\n9    against Cablevision.\n\n10                               BACKGROUND\n\n11        Today’s television viewers increasingly use digital video\n\n12   recorders (“DVRs”) instead of video cassette recorders (“VCRs”)\n\n13   to record television programs and play them back later at their\n\n14   convenience.   DVRs generally store recorded programming on an\n\n15   internal hard drive rather than a cassette.   But, as this case\n\n16   demonstrates, the generic term “DVR” actually refers to a growing\n\n17   number of different devices and systems.   Companies like TiVo\n\n18   sell a stand-alone DVR device that is typically connected to a\n\n19   user’s cable box and television much like a VCR.   Many cable\n\n20   companies also lease to their subscribers “set-top storage DVRs,”\n\n21   which combine many of the functions of a standard cable box and a\n\n22   stand-alone DVR in a single device.\n\n23        In March 2006, Cablevision, an operator of cable television\n\n24   systems, announced the advent of its new “Remote Storage DVR\n\n25   System.”   As designed, the RS-DVR allows Cablevision customers\n\n                                     -5-\n\f1    who do not have a stand-alone DVR to record cable programming on\n\n2    central hard drives housed and maintained by Cablevision at a\n\n3    “remote” location.    RS-DVR customers may then receive playback of\n\n4    those programs through their home television sets, using only a\n\n5    remote control and a standard cable box equipped with the RS-DVR\n\n6    software.    Cablevision notified its content providers, including\n\n7    plaintiffs, of its plans to offer RS-DVR, but it did not seek any\n\n8    license from them to operate or sell the RS-DVR.\n\n9           Plaintiffs, which hold the copyrights to numerous movies and\n\n10   television programs, sued Cablevision for declaratory and\n\n11   injunctive relief.    They alleged that Cablevision’s proposed\n\n12   operation of the RS-DVR would directly infringe their exclusive\n\n13   rights to both reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted\n\n14   works.    Critically for our analysis here, plaintiffs alleged\n\n15   theories only of direct infringement, not contributory\n\n16   infringement, and defendants waived any defense based on fair\n\n17   use.\n\n18          Ultimately, the United States District Court for the\n\n19   Southern District of New York (Denny Chin, Judge), awarded\n\n20   summary judgment to the plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from\n\n21   operating the RS-DVR system without licenses from its content\n\n22   providers.    See Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Cablevision\n\n23   Sys. Corp. (Cablevision I), 478 F. Supp. 2d 607 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).\n\n24   At the outset, we think it helpful to an understanding of our\n\n25   decision to describe, in greater detail, both the RS-DVR and the\n\n26   district court’s opinion.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f1    I.   Operation of the RS-DVR System\n\n2         Cable companies like Cablevision aggregate television\n\n3    programming from a wide variety of “content providers”–the\n\n4    various broadcast and cable channels that produce or provide\n\n5    individual programs–and transmit those programs into the homes of\n\n6    their subscribers via coaxial cable.    At the outset of the\n\n7    transmission process, Cablevision gathers the content of the\n\n8    various television channels into a single stream of data.\n\n9    Generally, this stream is processed and transmitted to\n\n10   Cablevision’s customers in real time.    Thus, if a Cartoon Network\n\n11   program is scheduled to air Monday night at 8pm, Cartoon Network\n\n12   transmits that program’s data to Cablevision and other cable\n\n13   companies nationwide at that time, and the cable companies\n\n14   immediately re-transmit the data to customers who subscribe to\n\n15   that channel.\n\n16        Under the new RS-DVR, this single stream of data is split\n\n17   into two streams.   The first is routed immediately to customers\n\n18   as before.   The second stream flows into a device called the\n\n19   Broadband Media Router (“BMR”), id. at 613, which buffers the\n\n20   data stream, reformats it, and sends it to the “Arroyo Server,”\n\n21   which consists, in relevant part, of two data buffers and a\n\n22   number of high-capacity hard disks.    The entire stream of data\n\n23   moves to the first buffer (the “primary ingest buffer”), at which\n\n24   point the server automatically inquires as to whether any\n\n25   customers want to record any of that programming.    If a customer\n\n26   has requested a particular program, the data for that program\n\n                                     -7-\n\f1    move from the primary buffer into a secondary buffer, and then\n\n2    onto a portion of one of the hard disks allocated to that\n\n3    customer.   As new data flow into the primary buffer, they\n\n4    overwrite a corresponding quantity of data already on the buffer.\n\n5    The primary ingest buffer holds no more than 0.1 seconds of each\n\n6    channel’s programming at any moment.        Thus, every tenth of a\n\n7    second, the data residing on this buffer are automatically erased\n\n8    and replaced.    The data buffer in the BMR holds no more than 1.2\n\n9    seconds of programming at any time.     While buffering occurs at\n\n10   other points in the operation of the RS-DVR, only the BMR buffer\n\n11   and the primary ingest buffer are utilized absent any request\n\n12   from an individual subscriber.\n\n13        As the district court observed, “the RS-DVR is not a single\n\n14   piece of equipment,” but rather “a complex system requiring\n\n15   numerous computers, processes, networks of cables, and facilities\n\n16   staffed by personnel twenty-four hours a day and seven days a\n\n17   week.”   Id. at 612.    To the customer, however, the processes of\n\n18   recording and playback on the RS-DVR are similar to that of a\n\n19   standard set-top DVR.     Using a remote control, the customer can\n\n20   record programming by selecting a program in advance from an on-\n\n21   screen guide, or by pressing the record button while viewing a\n\n22   given program.   A customer cannot, however, record the earlier\n\n23   portion of a program once it has begun.       To begin playback, the\n\n24   customer selects the show from an on-screen list of previously\n\n25   recorded programs.     See id. at 614-16.    The principal difference\n\n26   in operation is that, instead of sending signals from the remote\n\n                                       -8-\n\f1    to an on-set box, the viewer sends signals from the remote,\n\n2    through the cable, to the Arroyo Server at Cablevision’s central\n\n3    facility.   See id.   In this respect, RS-DVR more closely\n\n4    resembles a VOD service, whereby a cable subscriber uses his\n\n5    remote and cable box to request transmission of content, such as\n\n6    a movie, stored on computers at the cable company’s facility.\n\n7    Id. at 612.   But unlike a VOD service, RS-DVR users can only play\n\n8    content that they previously requested to be recorded.\n\n9          Cablevision has some control over the content available for\n\n10   recording: a customer can only record programs on the channels\n\n11   offered by Cablevision (assuming he subscribes to them).\n\n12   Cablevision can also modify the system to limit the number of\n\n13   channels available and considered doing so during development of\n\n14   the RS-DVR.   Id. at 613.\n\n15   II.   The District Court’s Decision\n\n16         In the district court, plaintiffs successfully argued that\n\n17   Cablevision’s proposed system would directly infringe their\n\n18   copyrights in three ways.    First, by briefly storing data in the\n\n19   primary ingest buffer and other data buffers integral to the\n\n20   function of the RS-DVR, Cablevision would make copies of\n\n21   protected works and thereby directly infringe plaintiffs’\n\n22   exclusive right of reproduction under the Copyright Act.     Second,\n\n23   by copying programs onto the Arroyo Server hard disks (the\n\n24   “playback copies”), Cablevision would again directly infringe the\n\n25   reproduction right.    And third, by transmitting the data from the\n\n26   Arroyo Server hard disks to its RS-DVR customers in response to a\n\n                                      -9-\n\f1    “playback” request, Cablevision would directly infringe\n\n2    plaintiffs’ exclusive right of public performance.     See id. at\n\n3    617.    Agreeing with all three arguments, the district court\n\n4    awarded summary declaratory judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined\n\n5    Cablevision from operating the RS–DVR system without obtaining\n\n6    licenses from the plaintiff copyright holders.\n\n7           As to the buffer data, the district court rejected\n\n8    defendants’ arguments 1) that the data were not “fixed” and\n\n9    therefore were not “copies” as defined in the Copyright Act, and\n\n10   2) that any buffer copying was de minimis because the buffers\n\n11   stored only small amounts of data for very short periods of time.\n\n12   In rejecting the latter argument, the district court noted that\n\n13   the “aggregate effect of the buffering” was to reproduce the\n\n14   entirety of Cablevision’s programming, and such copying “can\n\n15   hardly be called de minimis.”    Id. at 621.\n\n16          On the issue of whether creation of the playback copies made\n\n17   Cablevision liable for direct infringement, the parties and the\n\n18   district court agreed that the dispositive question was “who\n\n19   makes the copies”?    Id. at 617.   Emphasizing Cablevision’s\n\n20   “unfettered discretion” over the content available for recording,\n\n21   its ownership and maintenance of the RS-DVR components, and its\n\n22   “continuing relationship” with its RS-DVR customers, the district\n\n23   court concluded that “the copying of programming to the RS-DVR’s\n\n24   Arroyo servers . . . would be done not by the customer but by\n\n25   Cablevision, albeit at the customer’s request.”     Id. at 618, 620,\n\n26   621.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f1         Finally, as to the public performance right, Cablevision\n\n2    conceded that, during the playback, “the streaming of recorded\n\n3    programming in response to a customer’s request is a\n\n4    performance.”    Id. at 622.   Cablevision contended, however, that\n\n5    the work was performed not by Cablevision, but by the customer,\n\n6    an argument the district court rejected “for the same reasons\n\n7    that [it] reject[ed] the argument that the customer is ‘doing’\n\n8    the copying involved in the RS-DVR.”     Id.   Cablevision also\n\n9    argued that such a playback transmission was not “to the public,”\n\n10   and therefore not a public performance as defined in the\n\n11   Copyright Act, because it “emanates from a distinct copy of a\n\n12   program uniquely associated with one customer’s set-top box and\n\n13   intended for that customer’s exclusive viewing in his or her\n\n14   home.”   Id.   The district court disagreed, noting that\n\n15   “Cablevision would transmit the same program to members of the\n\n16   public, who may receive the performance at different times,\n\n17   depending on whether they view the program in real time or at a\n\n18   later time as an RS-DVR playback.”      Id. at 623 (emphasis added).\n\n19   The district court also relied on a case from the Northern\n\n20   District of California, On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia\n\n21   Pictures Industries, 777 F. Supp. 787 (N.D. Cal. 1991), which\n\n22   held that when the relationship between the transmitter and the\n\n23   audience of a performance is commercial, the transmission is “to\n\n24   the public,” see Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 623 (citing On\n\n25   Command, 777 F. Supp. at 790).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f1         Finding that the operation of the RS-DVR would infringe\n\n2    plaintiffs’ copyrights, the district court awarded summary\n\n3    judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from copying or\n\n4    publicly performing plaintiffs’ copyrighted works “in connection\n\n5    with its proposed RS-DVR system,” unless it obtained the\n\n6    necessary licenses.   Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 624.\n\n7    Cablevision appealed.\n\n8                               DISCUSSION\n\n9         We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\n10   novo.   Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d\n\n11   605, 607 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n12        “Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants copyright holders a\n\n13   bundle of exclusive rights. . . .”      Id. at 607-08.   This case\n\n14   implicates two of those rights: the right “to reproduce the\n\n15   copyrighted work in copies,” and the right “to perform the\n\n16   copyrighted work publicly.”   17 U.S.C. § 106(1), (4).      As\n\n17   discussed above, the district court found that Cablevision\n\n18   infringed the first right by 1) buffering the data from its\n\n19   programming stream and 2) copying content onto the Arroyo Server\n\n20   hard disks to enable playback of a program requested by an RS-DVR\n\n21   customer.   In addition, the district court found that Cablevision\n\n22   would infringe the public performance right by transmitting a\n\n23   program to an RS-DVR customer in response to that customer’s\n\n24   playback request.   We address each of these three allegedly\n\n25   infringing acts in turn.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f1    I.   The Buffer Data\n\n2         It is undisputed that Cablevision, not any customer or other\n\n3    entity, takes the content from one stream of programming, after\n\n4    the split, and stores it, one small piece at a time, in the BMR\n\n5    buffer and the primary ingest buffer.   As a result, the\n\n6    information is buffered before any customer requests a recording,\n\n7    and would be buffered even if no such request were made.     The\n\n8    question is whether, by buffering the data that make up a given\n\n9    work, Cablevision “reproduce[s]” that work “in copies,” 17 U.S.C.\n\n10   § 106(1), and thereby infringes the copyright holder’s\n\n11   reproduction right.\n\n12        “Copies,” as defined in the Copyright Act, “are material\n\n13   objects . . . in which a work is fixed by any method . . . and\n\n14   from which the work can be . . . reproduced.”   Id. § 101.      The\n\n15   Act also provides that a work is “‘fixed’ in a tangible medium of\n\n16   expression when its embodiment . . . is sufficiently permanent or\n\n17   stable to permit it to be . . . reproduced . . . for a period of\n\n18   more than transitory duration.”   Id. (emphasis added).    We\n\n19   believe that this language plainly imposes two distinct but\n\n20   related requirements: the work must be embodied in a medium,\n\n21   i.e., placed in a medium such that it can be perceived,\n\n22   reproduced, etc., from that medium (the “embodiment\n\n23   requirement”), and it must remain thus embodied “for a period of\n\n24   more than transitory duration” (the “duration requirement”).       See\n\n25   2 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §\n\n                                   -13-\n\f1    8.02[B][3], at 8-32 (2007).   Unless both requirements are met,\n\n2    the work is not “fixed” in the buffer, and, as a result, the\n\n3    buffer data is not a “copy” of the original work whose data is\n\n4    buffered.\n\n5         The district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily\n\n6    to the embodiment requirement.    As a result of this error, once\n\n7    it determined that the buffer data was “[c]learly . . . capable\n\n8    of being reproduced,” i.e., that the work was embodied in the\n\n9    buffer, the district court concluded that the work was therefore\n\n10   “fixed” in the buffer, and that a copy had thus been made.\n\n11   Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 621-22.   In doing so, it relied\n\n12   on a line of cases beginning with MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak\n\n13   Computer Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).   It also relied on\n\n14   the United States Copyright Office’s 2001 report on the Digital\n\n15   Millennium Copyright Act, which states, in essence, that an\n\n16   embodiment is fixed “[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so\n\n17   fleetingly that it cannot be copied.”   U.S. Copyright Office,\n\n18   DMCA Section 104 Report 111 (Aug. 2001) (“DMCA Report”) (emphasis\n\n19   added), available at\n\n20   http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/sec-104-report-vol-\n\n21   1.pdf.\n\n22        The district court’s reliance on cases like MAI Systems is\n\n23   misplaced.   In general, those cases conclude that an alleged copy\n\n24   is fixed without addressing the duration requirement; it does not\n\n25   follow, however, that those cases assume, much less establish,\n\n                                      -14-\n\f1    that such a requirement does not exist.     Indeed, the duration\n\n2    requirement, by itself, was not at issue in MAI Systems and its\n\n3    progeny.    As a result, they do not speak to the issues squarely\n\n4    before us here: If a work is only “embodied” in a medium for a\n\n5    period of transitory duration, can it be “fixed” in that medium,\n\n6    and thus a copy?    And what constitutes a period “of more than\n\n7    transitory duration”?\n\n8           In MAI Systems, defendant Peak Computer, Inc., performed\n\n9    maintenance and repairs on computers made and sold by MAI\n\n10   Systems.    In order to service a customer’s computer, a Peak\n\n11   employee had to operate the computer and run the computer’s\n\n12   copyrighted operating system software.     See MAI Sys., 991 F.2d at\n\n13   513.    The issue in MAI Systems was whether, by loading the\n\n14   software into the computer’s RAM,1 the repairman created a “copy”\n\n15   as defined in § 101.    See id. at 517.   The resolution of this\n\n16   issue turned on whether the software’s embodiment in the\n\n17   computer’s RAM was “fixed,” within the meaning of the same\n\n18   section.    The Ninth Circuit concluded that\n\n19          by showing that Peak loads the software into the RAM and is\n20          then able to view the system error log and diagnose the\n21          problem with the computer, MAI has adequately shown that the\n22          representation created in the RAM is “sufficiently permanent\n23          or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or\n24          otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory\n25          duration.”\n\n\n     1\n1         To run a computer program, the data representing that\n2    program must be transferred from a data storage medium (such as a\n3    floppy disk or a hard drive) to a form of Random Access Memory\n4    (“RAM”) where the data can be processed. The data buffers at\n5    issue here are also a form of RAM.\n\n                                     -15-\n\f1\n2    Id. at 518 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 101).\n3\n4         The MAI Systems court referenced the “transitory duration”\n\n5    language but did not discuss or analyze it.   The opinion notes\n\n6    that the defendants “vigorously” argued that the program’s\n\n7    embodiment in the RAM was not a copy, but it does not specify the\n\n8    arguments defendants made.   Id. at 517.   This omission suggests\n\n9    that the parties did not litigate the significance of the\n\n10   “transitory duration” language, and the court therefore had no\n\n11   occasion to address it.    This is unsurprising, because it seems\n\n12   fair to assume that in these cases the program was embodied in\n\n13   the RAM for at least several minutes.\n\n14        Accordingly, we construe MAI Systems and its progeny as\n\n15   holding that loading a program into a computer’s RAM can result\n\n16   in copying that program.   We do not read MAI Systems as holding\n\n17   that, as a matter of law, loading a program into a form of RAM\n\n18   always results in copying.   Such a holding would read the\n\n19   “transitory duration” language out of the definition, and we do\n\n20   not believe our sister circuit would dismiss this statutory\n\n21   language without even discussing it.    It appears the parties in\n\n22   MAI Systems simply did not dispute that the duration requirement\n\n23   was satisfied; this line of cases simply concludes that when a\n\n24   program is loaded into RAM, the embodiment requirement is\n\n25   satisfied–an important holding in itself, and one we see no\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f1    reason to quibble with here.2\n\n2         At least one court, relying on MAI Systems in a highly\n\n3    similar factual setting, has made this point explicitly.   In\n\n4    Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc. v. MAI Systems\n\n5    Corp., the district court expressly noted that the unlicensed\n\n6    user in that case ran copyrighted diagnostic software “for\n\n7    minutes or longer,” but that the program’s embodiment in the\n\n8    computer’s RAM might be too ephemeral to be fixed if the computer\n\n9    had been shut down “within seconds or fractions of a second”\n\n10   after loading the copyrighted program.   845 F. Supp. 356, 363\n\n11   (E.D. Va. 1994).   We have no quarrel with this reasoning; it\n\n12   merely makes explicit the reasoning that is implicit in the other\n\n13   MAI Systems cases.   Accordingly, those cases provide no support\n\n14   for the conclusion that the definition of “fixed” does not\n\n15   include a duration requirement.   See Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S.\n\n16   507, 511 (1924) (“Questions which merely lurk in the record,\n\n\n     2\n 1        The same reasoning also distinguishes this court’s opinion\n 2   in Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publishing Co., 158 F.3d 693 (2d\n 3   Cir. 1998). Language in that opinion, taken out of context,\n 4   suggests that the definition of “fixed” imposes only an\n 5   embodiment requirement: “Under § 101’s definition of ‘copies,’ a\n 6   work satisfies the fixation requirement when it is fixed in a\n 7   material object from which it can be perceived or communicated\n 8   directly or with the aid of a machine.” Id. at 702. Like the\n 9   MAI Systems cases, Matthew Bender only addresses the embodiment\n10   requirement: specifically, whether West’s copyrighted arrangement\n11   of judicial opinions was “embedded” in a CD-ROM compilation of\n12   opinions when the cases were normally arranged differently but\n13   could be manipulated by the user to replicate West’s copyrighted\n14   arrangement. Id. at 703. The opinion merely quotes the duration\n15   language without discussing it, see id. at 702; that case\n16   therefore does not compel us to conclude that the definition of\n17   “fixed” does not impose a duration requirement.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f1    neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are\n\n2    not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute\n\n3    precedents.”).\n\n4         Nor does the Copyright Office’s 2001 DMCA Report, also\n\n5    relied on by the district court in this case, explicitly suggest\n\n6    that the definition of “fixed” does not contain a duration\n\n7    requirement.   However, as noted above, it does suggest that an\n\n8    embodiment is fixed “[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so\n\n9    fleetingly that it cannot be copied, perceived or communicated.”\n\n10   DMCA Report, supra, at 111.   As we have stated, to determine\n\n11   whether a work is “fixed” in a given medium, the statutory\n\n12   language directs us to ask not only 1) whether a work is\n\n13   “embodied” in that medium, but also 2) whether it is embodied in\n\n14   the medium “for a period of more than transitory duration.”\n\n15   According to the Copyright Office, if the work is capable of\n\n16   being copied from that medium for any amount of time, the answer\n\n17   to both questions is “yes.”   The problem with this interpretation\n\n18   is that it reads the “transitory duration” language out of the\n\n19   statute.\n\n20        We assume, as the parties do, that the Copyright Office’s\n\n21   pronouncement deserves only Skidmore deference, deference based\n\n22   on its “power to persuade.”   Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S.\n\n23   134, 140 (1944).   And because the Office’s interpretation does\n\n24   not explain why Congress would include language in a definition\n\n25   if it intended courts to ignore that language, we are not\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f1    persuaded.\n\n2         In sum, no case law or other authority dissuades us from\n\n3    concluding that the definition of “fixed” imposes both an\n\n4    embodiment requirement and a duration requirement.   Accord CoStar\n\n5    Group Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544, 551 (4th Cir. 2004)\n\n6    (while temporary reproductions “may be made in this transmission\n\n7    process, they would appear not to be ‘fixed’ in the sense that\n\n8    they are ‘of more than transitory duration’”).   We now turn to\n\n9    whether, in this case, those requirements are met by the buffer\n\n10   data.\n\n11        Cablevision does not seriously dispute that copyrighted\n\n12   works are “embodied” in the buffer.   Data in the BMR buffer can\n\n13   be reformatted and transmitted to the other components of the RS-\n\n14   DVR system.   Data in the primary ingest buffer can be copied onto\n\n15   the Arroyo hard disks if a user has requested a recording of that\n\n16   data.   Thus, a work’s “embodiment” in either buffer “is\n\n17   sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,\n\n18   reproduced,” (as in the case of the ingest buffer) “or otherwise\n\n19   communicated” (as in the BMR buffer).   17 U.S.C. § 101.   The\n\n20   result might be different if only a single second of a much\n\n21   longer work was placed in the buffer in isolation.   In such a\n\n22   situation, it might be reasonable to conclude that only a\n\n23   minuscule portion of a work, rather than “a work” was embodied in\n\n24   the buffer.   Here, however, where every second of an entire work\n\n25   is placed, one second at a time, in the buffer, we conclude that\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f1    the work is embodied in the buffer.\n\n2         Does any such embodiment last “for a period of more than\n\n3    transitory duration”?   Id.   No bit of data remains in any buffer\n\n4    for more than a fleeting 1.2 seconds.   And unlike the data in\n\n5    cases like MAI Systems, which remained embodied in the computer’s\n\n6    RAM memory until the user turned the computer off, each bit of\n\n7    data here is rapidly and automatically overwritten as soon as it\n\n8    is processed.   While our inquiry is necessarily fact-specific,\n\n9    and other factors not present here may alter the duration\n\n10   analysis significantly, these facts strongly suggest that the\n\n11   works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a\n\n12   “transitory” period, thus failing the duration requirement.\n\n13        Against this evidence, plaintiffs argue only that the\n\n14   duration is not transitory because the data persist “long enough\n\n15   for Cablevision to make reproductions from them.”   Br. of Pls.-\n\n16   Appellees the Cartoon Network et al. at 51.   As we have explained\n\n17   above, however, this reasoning impermissibly reads the duration\n\n18   language out of the statute, and we reject it.   Given that the\n\n19   data reside in no buffer for more than 1.2 seconds before being\n\n20   automatically overwritten, and in the absence of compelling\n\n21   arguments to the contrary, we believe that the copyrighted works\n\n22   here are not “embodied” in the buffers for a period of more than\n\n23   transitory duration, and are therefore not “fixed” in the\n\n24   buffers.   Accordingly, the acts of buffering in the operation of\n\n25   the RS-DVR do not create copies, as the Copyright Act defines\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f1    that term.    Our resolution of this issue renders it unnecessary\n\n2    for us to determine whether any copies produced by buffering data\n\n3    would be de minimis, and we express no opinion on that question.\n\n4    II.   Direct Liability for Creating the Playback Copies\n\n5          In most copyright disputes, the allegedly infringing act and\n\n6    the identity of the infringer are never in doubt.    These cases\n\n7    turn on whether the conduct in question does, in fact, infringe\n\n8    the plaintiff’s copyright.    In this case, however, the core of\n\n9    the dispute is over the authorship of the infringing conduct.\n\n10   After an RS-DVR subscriber selects a program to record, and that\n\n11   program airs, a copy of the program–a copyrighted work–resides on\n\n12   the hard disks of Cablevision’s Arroyo Server, its creation\n\n13   unauthorized by the copyright holder.    The question is who made\n\n14   this copy.    If it is Cablevision, plaintiffs’ theory of direct\n\n15   infringement succeeds; if it is the customer, plaintiffs’ theory\n\n16   fails because Cablevision would then face, at most, secondary\n\n17   liability, a theory of liability expressly disavowed by\n\n18   plaintiffs.\n\n19         Few cases examine the line between direct and contributory\n\n20   liability.    Both parties cite a line of cases beginning with\n\n21   Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communications\n\n22   Services, 907 F. Supp. 1361 (N.D. Cal. 1995).    In Netcom, a\n\n23   third-party customer of the defendant Internet service provider\n\n24   (“ISP”) posted a copyrighted work that was automatically\n\n25   reproduced by the defendant’s computer.    The district court\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f1    refused to impose direct liability on the ISP, reasoning that\n\n2    “[a]lthough copyright is a strict liability statute, there should\n\n3    still be some element of volition or causation which is lacking\n\n4    where a defendant’s system is merely used to create a copy by a\n\n5    third party.”    Id. at 1370.   Recently, the Fourth Circuit\n\n6    endorsed the Netcom decision, noting that\n\n 7          to establish direct liability under . . . the Act, something\n 8          more must be shown than mere ownership of a machine used by\n 9          others to make illegal copies. There must be actual\n10          infringing conduct with a nexus sufficiently close and\n11          causal to the illegal copying that one could conclude that\n12          the machine owner himself trespassed on the exclusive domain\n13          of the copyright owner.”\n14\n15   CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544, 550 (4th Cir.\n\n16   2004).\n\n17          Here, the district court pigeon-holed the conclusions\n\n18   reached in Netcom and its progeny as “premised on the unique\n\n19   attributes of the Internet.”     Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n20   620.    While the Netcom court was plainly concerned with a theory\n\n21   of direct liability that would effectively “hold the entire\n\n22   Internet liable” for the conduct of a single user, 907 F. Supp.\n\n23   at 1372, its reasoning and conclusions, consistent with\n\n24   precedents of this court and the Supreme Court, and with the text\n\n25   of the Copyright Act, transcend the Internet.     Like the Fourth\n\n26   Circuit, we reject the contention that “the Netcom decision was\n\n27   driven by expedience and that its holding is inconsistent with\n\n28   the established law of copyright,” CoStar, 373 F.3d at 549, and\n\n29   we find it “a particularly rational interpretation of § 106,” id.\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\f1    at 551, rather than a special-purpose rule applicable only to\n\n2    ISPs.\n\n3         When there is a dispute as to the author of an allegedly\n\n4    infringing instance of reproduction, Netcom and its progeny\n\n5    direct our attention to the volitional conduct that causes the\n\n6    copy to be made.   There are only two instances of volitional\n\n7    conduct in this case: Cablevision’s conduct in designing,\n\n8    housing, and maintaining a system that exists only to produce a\n\n9    copy, and a customer’s conduct in ordering that system to produce\n\n10   a copy of a specific program.   In the case of a VCR, it seems\n\n11   clear–and we know of no case holding otherwise–that the operator\n\n12   of the VCR, the person who actually presses the button to make\n\n13   the recording, supplies the necessary element of volition, not\n\n14   the person who manufactures, maintains, or, if distinct from the\n\n15   operator, owns the machine.   We do not believe that an RS-DVR\n\n16   customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a VCR user to\n\n17   impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for\n\n18   copies that are made automatically upon that customer’s command.\n\n19        The district court emphasized the fact that copying is\n\n20   “instrumental” rather than “incidental” to the function of the\n\n21   RS-DVR system.   Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 620.   While\n\n22   that may distinguish the RS-DVR from the ISPs in Netcom and\n\n23   CoStar, it does not distinguish the RS-DVR from a VCR, a\n\n24   photocopier, or even a typical copy shop.   And the parties do not\n\n25   seem to contest that a company that merely makes photocopiers\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f1    available to the public on its premises, without more, is not\n\n2    subject to liability for direct infringement for reproductions\n\n3    made by customers using those copiers.    They only dispute whether\n\n4    Cablevision is similarly situated to such a proprietor.\n\n5         The district court found Cablevision analogous to a copy\n\n6    shop that makes course packs for college professors.    In the\n\n7    leading case involving such a shop, for example, “[t]he professor\n\n8    [gave] the copyshop the materials of which the coursepack [was]\n\n9    to be made up, and the copyshop [did] the rest.”    Princeton Univ.\n\n10   Press v. Mich. Document Servs., 99 F.3d 1381, 1384 (6th Cir.\n\n11   1996) (en banc).   There did not appear to be any serious dispute\n\n12   in that case that the shop itself was directly liable for\n\n13   reproducing copyrighted works.    The district court here found\n\n14   that Cablevision, like this copy shop, would be “doing” the\n\n15   copying, albeit “at the customer’s behest.”    Cablevision I, 478\n\n16   F. Supp. 2d at 620.\n\n17        But because volitional conduct is an important element of\n\n18   direct liability, the district court’s analogy is flawed.    In\n\n19   determining who actually “makes” a copy, a significant difference\n\n20   exists between making a request to a human employee, who then\n\n21   volitionally operates the copying system to make the copy, and\n\n22   issuing a command directly to a system, which automatically obeys\n\n23   commands and engages in no volitional conduct.    In cases like\n\n24   Princeton University Press, the defendants operated a copying\n\n25   device and sold the product they made using that device.    See 99\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f1    F.3d at 1383 (“The corporate defendant . . . is a commercial\n\n2    copyshop that reproduced substantial segments of copyrighted\n\n3    works of scholarship, bound the copies into ‘coursepacks,’ and\n\n4    sold the coursepacks to students . . . .”).   Here, by selling\n\n5    access to a system that automatically produces copies on command,\n\n6    Cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges\n\n7    customers to use a photocopier on his premises, and it seems\n\n8    incorrect to say, without more, that such a proprietor “makes”\n\n9    any copies when his machines are actually operated by his\n\n10   customers.   See Netcom, 907 F. Supp. at 1369.   Some courts have\n\n11   held to the contrary, but they do not explicitly explain why, and\n\n12   we find them unpersuasive.   See, e.g., Elektra Records Co. v. Gem\n\n13   Elec. Distribs., Inc., 360 F. Supp. 821, 823 (E.D.N.Y. 1973)\n\n14   (concluding that, “regardless” of whether customers or\n\n15   defendants’ employees operated the tape-copying machines at\n\n16   defendants’ stores, defendant had actively infringed copyrights).\n\n17        The district court also emphasized Cablevision’s “unfettered\n\n18   discretion in selecting the programming that it would make\n\n19   available for recording.”    Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 620.\n\n20   This conduct is indeed more proximate to the creation of illegal\n\n21   copying than, say, operating an ISP or opening a copy shop, where\n\n22   all copied content was supplied by the customers themselves or\n\n23   other third parties.   Nonetheless, we do not think it\n\n24   sufficiently proximate to the copying to displace the customer as\n\n25   the person who “makes” the copies when determining liability\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f1    under the Copyright Act.    Cablevision, we note, also has\n\n2    subscribers who use home VCRs or DVRs (like TiVo), and has\n\n3    significant control over the content recorded by these customers.\n\n4    But this control is limited to the channels of programming\n\n5    available to a customer and not to the programs themselves.\n\n6    Cablevision has no control over what programs are made available\n\n7    on individual channels or when those programs will air, if at\n\n8    all.    In this respect, Cablevision possesses far less control\n\n9    over recordable content than it does in the VOD context, where it\n\n10   actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual\n\n11   programs available for viewing.    For these reasons, we are not\n\n12   inclined to say that Cablevision, rather than the user, “does”\n\n13   the copying produced by the RS-DVR system.    As a result, we find\n\n14   that the district court erred in concluding that Cablevision,\n\n15   rather than its RS-DVR customers, makes the copies carried out by\n\n16   the RS-DVR system.\n\n17          Our refusal to find Cablevision directly liable on these\n\n18   facts is buttressed by the existence and contours of the Supreme\n\n19   Court’s doctrine of contributory liability in the copyright\n\n20   context.    After all, the purpose of any causation-based liability\n\n21   doctrine is to identify the actor (or actors) whose “conduct has\n\n22   been so significant and important a cause that [he or she] should\n\n23   be legally responsible.”    W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and\n\n24   Keeton on Torts § 42, at 273 (5th ed. 1984).    But here, to the\n\n25   extent that we may construe the boundaries of direct liability\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f1    more narrowly, the doctrine of contributory liability stands\n\n2    ready to provide adequate protection to copyrighted works.\n\n3         Most of the facts found dispositive by the district\n\n4    court–e.g., Cablevision’s “continuing relationship” with its RS-\n\n5    DVR customers, its control over recordable content, and the\n\n6    “instrumental[ity]” of copying to the RS-DVR system, Cablevision\n\n7    I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 618-20–seem to us more relevant to the\n\n8    question of contributory liability.     In Sony Corp. of America v.\n\n9    Universal City Studios, Inc., the lack of an “ongoing\n\n10   relationship” between Sony and its VCR customers supported the\n\n11   Court’s conclusion that it should not impose contributory\n\n12   liability on Sony for any infringing copying done by Sony VCR\n\n13   owners.   464 U.S. 417, 437-38 (1984).    The Sony Court did deem it\n\n14   “just” to impose liability on a party in a “position to control”\n\n15   the infringing uses of another, but as a contributory, not\n\n16   direct, infringer.    Id. at 437.   And asking whether copying\n\n17   copyrighted material is only “incidental” to a given technology\n\n18   is akin to asking whether that technology has “commercially\n\n19   significant noninfringing uses,” another inquiry the Sony Court\n\n20   found relevant to whether imposing contributory liability was\n\n21   just.   Id. at 442.\n\n22        The Supreme Court’s desire to maintain a meaningful\n\n23   distinction between direct and contributory copyright\n\n24   infringement is consistent with congressional intent.     The Patent\n\n25   Act, unlike the Copyright Act, expressly provides that someone\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f1    who “actively induces infringement of a patent” is “liable as an\n\n2    infringer,” 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), just like someone who commits the\n\n3    underlying infringing act by “us[ing]” a patented invention\n\n4    without authorization, id. § 271(a).     In contrast, someone who\n\n5    merely “sells . . . a material or apparatus for use in practicing\n\n6    a patented process” faces only liability as a “contributory\n\n7    infringer.”   Id. § 271(c).    If Congress had meant to assign\n\n8    direct liability to both the person who actually commits a\n\n9    copyright-infringing act and any person who actively induces that\n\n10   infringement, the Patent Act tells us that it knew how to draft a\n\n11   statute that would have this effect.     Because Congress did not do\n\n12   so, the Sony Court concluded that “[t]he Copyright Act does not\n\n13   expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by\n\n14   another.”   464 U.S. at 434.    Furthermore, in cases like Sony, the\n\n15   Supreme Court has strongly signaled its intent to use the\n\n16   doctrine of contributory infringement, not direct infringement,\n\n17   to “identify[] the circumstances in which it is just to hold one\n\n18   individual accountable for the actions of another.”     Id. at 435.\n\n19   Thus, although Sony warns us that “the lines between direct\n\n20   infringement, contributory infringement, and vicarious liability\n\n21   are not clearly drawn,” id. at 435 n.17 (internal quotation marks\n\n22   and citation omitted), that decision does not absolve us of our\n\n23   duty to discern where that line falls in cases, like this one,\n\n24   that require us to decide the question.\n\n25        The district court apparently concluded that Cablevision’s\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\f1    operation of the RS-DVR system would contribute in such a major\n\n2    way to the copying done by another that it made sense to say that\n\n3    Cablevision was a direct infringer, and thus, in effect, was\n\n4    “doing” the relevant copying.   There are certainly other cases,\n\n5    not binding on us, that follow this approach.   See, e.g., Playboy\n\n6    Enters. v. Russ Hardenburgh, Inc., 982 F. Supp. 503, 513 (N.D.\n\n7    Ohio 1997) (noting that defendant ISP’s encouragement of its\n\n8    users to copy protected files was “crucial” to finding that it\n\n9    was a direct infringer).   We need not decide today whether one’s\n\n10   contribution to the creation of an infringing copy may be so\n\n11   great that it warrants holding that party directly liable for the\n\n12   infringement, even though another party has actually made the\n\n13   copy.   We conclude only that on the facts of this case, copies\n\n14   produced by the RS-DVR system are “made” by the RS-DVR customer,\n\n15   and Cablevision’s contribution to this reproduction by providing\n\n16   the system does not warrant the imposition of direct liability.\n\n17   Therefore, Cablevision is entitled to summary judgment on this\n\n18   point, and the district court erred in awarding summary judgment\n\n19   to plaintiffs.\n\n20   III. Transmission of RS-DVR Playback\n\n21           Plaintiffs’ final theory is that Cablevision will violate\n\n22   the Copyright Act by engaging in unauthorized public performances\n\n23   of their works through the playback of the RS-DVR copies.   The\n\n24   Act grants a copyright owner the exclusive right, “in the case of\n\n25   . . . motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f1    copyrighted work publicly.”     17 U.S.C. § 106(4).   Section 101,\n\n2    the definitional section of the Act, explains that\n\n 3          [t]o perform or display a work “publicly” means (1) to\n 4          perform or display it at a place open to the public or at\n 5          any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a\n 6          normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is\n 7          gathered; or (2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a\n 8          performance or display of the work to a place specified by\n 9          clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or\n10          process, whether the members of the public capable of\n11          receiving the performance or display receive it in the same\n12          place or in separate places and at the same time or at\n13          different times.\n14\n15   Id. § 101.\n16\n17          The parties agree that this case does not implicate clause\n\n18   (1).    Accordingly, we ask whether these facts satisfy the second,\n\n19   “transmit clause” of the public performance definition: Does\n\n20   Cablevision “transmit . . . a performance . . . of the work . . .\n\n21   to the public”?    Id.   No one disputes that the RS-DVR playback\n\n22   results in the transmission of a performance of a work–the\n\n23   transmission from the Arroyo Server to the customer’s television\n\n24   set.    Cablevision contends that (1) the RS-DVR customer, rather\n\n25   than Cablevision, does the transmitting and thus the performing\n\n26   and (2) the transmission is not “to the public” under the\n\n27   transmit clause.\n\n28          As to Cablevision’s first argument, we note that our\n\n29   conclusion in Part II that the customer, not Cablevision, “does”\n\n30   the copying does not dictate a parallel conclusion that the\n\n31   customer, and not Cablevision, “performs” the copyrighted work.\n\n32   The definitions that delineate the contours of the reproduction\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\f1    and public performance rights vary in significant ways.       For\n\n2    example, the statute defines the verb “perform” and the noun\n\n3    “copies,” but not the verbs “reproduce” or “copy.”      Id.   We need\n\n4    not address Cablevision’s first argument further because, even if\n\n5    we assume that Cablevision makes the transmission when an RS-DVR\n\n6    playback occurs, we find that the RS-DVR playback, as described\n\n7    here, does not involve the transmission of a performance “to the\n\n8    public.”\n\n9         The statute itself does not expressly define the term\n\n10   “performance” or the phrase “to the public.”      It does explain\n\n11   that a transmission may be “to the public . . . whether the\n\n12   members of the public capable of receiving the performance . . .\n\n13   receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the\n\n14   same time or at different times.”     Id.   This plain language\n\n15   instructs us that, in determining whether a transmission is “to\n\n16   the public,” it is of no moment that the potential recipients of\n\n17   the transmission are in different places, or that they may\n\n18   receive the transmission at different times.      The implication\n\n19   from this same language, however, is that it is relevant, in\n\n20   determining whether a transmission is made to the public, to\n\n21   discern who is “capable of receiving” the performance being\n\n22   transmitted.   The fact that the statute says “capable of\n\n23   receiving the performance,” instead of “capable of receiving the\n\n24   transmission,” underscores the fact that a transmission of a\n\n25   performance is itself a performance.     Cf. Buck v. Jewell-La Salle\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f1    Realty Co., 283 U.S. 191, 197-98 (1931).\n\n2         The legislative history of the transmit clause supports this\n\n3    interpretation.   The House Report on the 1976 Copyright Act\n\n4    states that\n\n 5        [u]nder the bill, as under the present law, a performance\n 6        made available by transmission to the public at large is\n 7        “public” even though the recipients are not gathered in a\n 8        single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the\n 9        potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus\n10        at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply\n11        whenever the potential recipients of the transmission\n12        represent a limited segment of the public, such as the\n13        occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable\n14        television service.\n15\n16   H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64-65 (1976), reprinted in 1976\n\n17   U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5678 (emphases added).\n\n18        Plaintiffs also reference a 1967 House Report, issued nearly\n\n19   a decade before the Act we are interpreting, stating that the\n\n20   same principles apply where the transmission is “capable of\n\n21   reaching different recipients at different times, as in the case\n\n22   of sounds or images stored in an information system and capable\n\n23   of being performed or displayed at the initiative of individual\n\n24   members of the public.”   H.R. Rep. No. 90-83, at 29 (1967)\n\n25   (emphases added).   We question how much deference this report\n\n26   deserves.   But we need not belabor the point here, as the 1967\n\n27   report is consistent with both legislative history\n\n28   contemporaneous with the Act’s passage and our own interpretation\n\n29   of the statute’s plain meaning.\n\n30      From the foregoing, it is evident that the transmit clause\n\n31   directs us to examine who precisely is “capable of receiving” a\n\n                                    -32-\n\f1    particular transmission of a performance.    Cablevision argues\n\n2    that, because each RS-DVR transmission is made using a single\n\n3    unique copy of a work, made by an individual subscriber, one that\n\n4    can be decoded exclusively by that subscriber’s cable box, only\n\n5    one subscriber is capable of receiving any given RS-DVR\n\n6    transmission.    This argument accords with the language of the\n\n7    transmit clause, which, as described above, directs us to\n\n8    consider the potential audience of a given transmission.    We are\n\n9    unpersuaded by the district court’s reasoning and the plaintiffs’\n\n10   arguments that we should consider a larger potential audience in\n\n11   determining whether a transmission is “to the public.”\n\n12        The district court, in deciding whether the RS-DVR playback\n\n13   of a program to a particular customer is “to the public,”\n\n14   apparently considered all of Cablevision’s customers who\n\n15   subscribe to the channel airing that program and all of\n\n16   Cablevision’s RS-DVR subscribers who request a copy of that\n\n17   program.   Thus, it concluded that the RS-DVR playbacks\n\n18   constituted public performances because “Cablevision would\n\n19   transmit the same program to members of the public, who may\n\n20   receive the performance at different times, depending on whether\n\n21   they view the program in real time or at a later time as an RS-\n\n22   DVR playback.”    Cablevision I, 478 F. Supp. 2d at 623 (emphasis\n\n23   added).    In essence, the district court suggested that, in\n\n24   considering whether a transmission is “to the public,” we\n\n25   consider not the potential audience of a particular transmission,\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\f1    but the potential audience of the underlying work (i.e., “the\n\n2    program”) whose content is being transmitted.\n\n3         We cannot reconcile the district court’s approach with the\n\n4    language of the transmit clause.    That clause speaks of people\n\n5    capable of receiving a particular “transmission” or\n\n6    “performance,” and not of the potential audience of a particular\n\n7    “work.”   Indeed, such an approach would render the “to the\n\n8    public” language surplusage.   Doubtless the potential audience\n\n9    for every copyrighted audiovisual work is the general public.      As\n\n10   a result, any transmission of the content of a copyrighted work\n\n11   would constitute a public performance under the district court’s\n\n12   interpretation.   But the transmit clause obviously contemplates\n\n13   the existence of non-public transmissions; if it did not,\n\n14   Congress would have stopped drafting that clause after\n\n15   “performance.”\n\n16        On appeal, plaintiffs offer a slight variation of this\n\n17   interpretation.   They argue that both in its real-time cablecast\n\n18   and via the RS-DVR playback, Cablevision is in fact transmitting\n\n19   the “same performance” of a given work: the performance of the\n\n20   work that occurs when the programming service supplying\n\n21   Cablevision’s content transmits that content to Cablevision and\n\n22   the service’s other licensees.    See Br. of Pls.-Appellees\n\n23   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. et al. at 27 (“Fox Br.”) (“The\n\n24   critical factor . . . is that the same performance is transmitted\n\n25   to different subscribers at different times . . . . more\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\f1    specifically, the performance of that program by HBO or another\n\n2    programming service.” (third emphasis added)).\n\n3         Thus, according to plaintiffs, when Congress says that to\n\n4    perform a work publicly means to transmit. . . a performance. . .\n\n5    to the public, they really meant “transmit . . . the ‘original\n\n6    performance’ . . . to the public.”    The implication of this\n\n7    theory is that to determine whether a given transmission of a\n\n8    performance is “to the public,” we would consider not only the\n\n9    potential audience of that transmission, but also the potential\n\n10   audience of any transmission of the same underlying “original”\n\n11   performance.\n\n12        Like the district court’s interpretation, this view obviates\n\n13   any possibility of a purely private transmission.    Furthermore,\n\n14   it makes Cablevision’s liability depend, in part, on the actions\n\n15   of legal strangers.   Assume that HBO transmits a copyrighted work\n\n16   to both Cablevision and Comcast.   Cablevision merely retransmits\n\n17   the work from one Cablevision facility to another, while Comcast\n\n18   retransmits the program to its subscribers.    Under plaintiffs’\n\n19   interpretation, Cablevision would still be transmitting the\n\n20   performance to the public, solely because Comcast has transmitted\n\n21   the same underlying performance to the public.    Similarly, a\n\n22   hapless customer who records a program in his den and later\n\n23   transmits the recording to a television in his bedroom would be\n\n24   liable for publicly performing the work simply because some other\n\n25   party had once transmitted the same underlying performance to the\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f1    public.\n\n2         We do not believe Congress intended such odd results.\n\n3    Although the transmit clause is not a model of clarity, we\n\n4    believe that when Congress speaks of transmitting a performance\n\n5    to the public, it refers to the performance created by the act of\n\n6    transmission.   Thus, HBO transmits its own performance of a work\n\n7    when it transmits to Cablevision, and Cablevision transmits its\n\n8    own performance of the same work when it retransmits the feed\n\n9    from HBO.\n\n10        Furthermore, we believe it would be inconsistent with our\n\n11   own transmit clause jurisprudence to consider the potential\n\n12   audience of an upstream transmission by a third party when\n\n13   determining whether a defendant’s own subsequent transmission of\n\n14   a performance is “to the public.”     In National Football League v.\n\n15   PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture (NFL), 211 F.3d 10 (2d Cir. 2000), we\n\n16   examined the transmit clause in the context of satellite\n\n17   television provider PrimeTime, which captured protected content\n\n18   in the United States from the NFL, transmitted it from the United\n\n19   States to a satellite (“the uplink”), and then transmitted it\n\n20   from the satellite to subscribers in both the United States and\n\n21   Canada (“the downlink”).   PrimeTime had a license to transmit to\n\n22   its U.S. customers, but not its Canadian customers.    It argued\n\n23   that although the downlink transmission to its Canadian\n\n24   subscribers was a public performance, it could not be held liable\n\n25   for that act because it occurred entirely outside of the United\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\f1    States and therefore was not subject to the strictures of the\n\n2    Copyright Act.   It also argued that the uplink transmission was\n\n3    not a public performance because it was a transmission to a\n\n4    single satellite.   See id. at 12.\n\n5         The NFL court did not question the first assumption, but it\n\n6    flatly rejected the second on a specific and germane ground:\n\n 7        We believe the most logical interpretation of the Copyright\n 8        Act is to hold that a public performance or display includes\n 9        each step in the process by which a protected work wends its\n10        way to its audience. Under that analysis, it is clear that\n11        PrimeTime’s uplink transmission of signals captured in the\n12        United States is a step in the process by which NFL’s\n13        protected work wends its way to a public audience.\n14\n15   Id. at 13 (emphasis added) (internal quotation and citation\n\n16   omitted).   Thus, while the uplink transmission that took place in\n\n17   the United States was not, in itself, “to the public,” the NFL\n\n18   court deemed it so because it ultimately resulted in an\n\n19   undisputed public performance.    Notably, the NFL court did not\n\n20   base its decision on the fact that an upstream transmission by\n\n21   another party (the NFL) might have been to the public.    Nor did\n\n22   the court base its decision on the fact that Primetime\n\n23   simultaneously transmitted a performance of the work to the\n\n24   public in the United States.   Because NFL directs us to look\n\n25   downstream, rather than upstream or laterally, to determine\n\n26   whether any link in a chain of transmissions made by a party\n\n27   constitutes a public performance, we reject plaintiffs’\n\n28   contention that we examine the potential recipients of the\n\n29   content provider’s initial transmission to determine who is\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f1    capable of receiving the RS-DVR playback transmission.\n\n2         Plaintiffs also rely on NFL for the proposition that\n\n3    Cablevision publicly performs a work when it splits its\n\n4    programming stream and transmits the second stream to the RS-DVR\n\n5    system.   Because NFL only supports that conclusion if we\n\n6    determine that the final transmission in the chain (i.e., the RS-\n\n7    DVR playback transmission) is “to the public,” plaintiffs’\n\n8    reliance on NFL is misplaced.    NFL dealt with a chain of\n\n9    transmissions whose final link was undisputedly a public\n\n10   performance.    It therefore does not guide our current inquiry.\n\n11        In sum, none of the arguments advanced by plaintiffs or the\n\n12   district court alters our conclusion that, under the transmit\n\n13   clause, we must examine the potential audience of a given\n\n14   transmission by an alleged infringer to determine whether that\n\n15   transmission is “to the public.”    And because the RS-DVR system,\n\n16   as designed, only makes transmissions to one subscriber using a\n\n17   copy made by that subscriber, we believe that the universe of\n\n18   people capable of receiving an RS-DVR transmission is the single\n\n19   subscriber whose self-made copy is used to create that\n\n20   transmission.\n\n21        Plaintiffs contend that it is “wholly irrelevant, in\n\n22   determining the existence of a public performance, whether\n\n23   ‘unique’ copies of the same work are used to make the\n\n24   transmissions.”    Fox Br. at 27.   But plaintiffs cite no authority\n\n25   for this contention.    And our analysis of the transmit clause\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\f1    suggests that, in general, any factor that limits the potential\n\n2    audience of a transmission is relevant.\n\n3         Furthermore, no transmission of an audiovisual work can be\n\n4    made, we assume, without using a copy of that work: to transmit a\n\n5    performance of a movie, for example, the transmitter generally\n\n6    must obtain a copy of that movie.      As a result, in the context of\n\n7    movies, television programs, and other audiovisual works, the\n\n8    right of reproduction can reinforce and protect the right of\n\n9    public performance.   If the owner of a copyright believes he is\n\n10   injured by a particular transmission of a performance of his\n\n11   work, he may be able to seek redress not only for the infringing\n\n12   transmission, but also for the underlying copying that\n\n13   facilitated the transmission.   Given this interplay between the\n\n14   various rights in this context, it seems quite consistent with\n\n15   the Act to treat a transmission made using Copy A as distinct\n\n16   from one made using Copy B, just as we would treat a transmission\n\n17   made by Cablevision as distinct from an otherwise identical\n\n18   transmission made by Comcast.   Both factors–the identity of the\n\n19   transmitter and the source material of the transmission–limit the\n\n20   potential audience of a transmission in this case and are\n\n21   therefore germane in determining whether that transmission is\n\n22   made “to the public.”\n\n23        Indeed, we believe that Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\n\n24   v. Redd Horne, Inc., 749 F.2d 154 (3d Cir. 1984), relied on by\n\n25   both plaintiffs and the district court, supports our decision to\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\f1    accord significance to the existence and use of distinct copies\n\n2    in our transmit clause analysis.   In that case, defendant\n\n3    operated a video rental store, Maxwell’s, which also housed a\n\n4    number of small private booths containing seats and a television.\n\n5    Patrons would select a film, enter the booth, and close the door.\n\n6    An employee would then load a copy of the requested movie into a\n\n7    bank of VCRs at the front of the store and push play, thereby\n\n8    transmitting the content of the tape to the television in the\n\n9    viewing booth.   See id. at 156-57.\n\n10        The Third Circuit found that defendants’ conduct constituted\n\n11   a public performance under both clauses of the statutory\n\n12   definition.   In concluding that Maxwell’s violated the transmit\n\n13   clause, that court explicitly relied on the fact that defendants\n\n14   showed the same copy of a work seriatim to its clientele, and it\n\n15   quoted a treatise emphasizing the same fact:\n\n16        Professor Nimmer’s examination of this definition is\n17        particularly pertinent: “if the same copy . . . of a given\n18        work is repeatedly played (i.e., ‘performed’) by different\n19        members of the public, albeit at different times, this\n20        constitutes a ‘public’ performance.” 2 M. Nimmer, § 8.14\n21        [C][3], at 8-142 (emphasis in original). . . . Although\n22        Maxwell’s has only one copy of each film, it shows each copy\n23        repeatedly to different members of the public. This\n24        constitutes a public performance.\n25\n26   Id. at 159 (first omission in original).\n27\n28        Unfortunately, neither the Redd Horne court nor Prof. Nimmer\n\n29   explicitly explains why the use of a distinct copy affects the\n\n30   transmit clause inquiry.   But our independent analysis confirms\n\n31   the soundness of their intuition: the use of a unique copy may\n\n\n                                    -40-\n\f1    limit the potential audience of a transmission and is therefore\n\n2    relevant to whether that transmission is made “to the public.”\n\n3    Plaintiffs’ unsupported arguments to the contrary are unavailing.\n\n4         Given that each RS-DVR transmission is made to a given\n\n5    subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber, we conclude that\n\n6    such a transmission is not “to the public,” without analyzing the\n\n7    contours of that phrase in great detail.     No authority cited by\n\n8    the parties or the district court persuades us to the contrary.\n\n9         In addition to Redd Horne, the district court also cited and\n\n10   analyzed On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,\n\n11   777 F. Supp. 787 (N.D. Cal. 1991), in its transmit clause\n\n12   analysis.   In that case, defendant On Command developed and sold\n\n13   “a system for the electronic delivery of movie video tapes,”\n\n14   which it sold to hotels.    Id. at 788.    The hub of the system was\n\n15   a bank of video cassette players, each containing a copy of a\n\n16   particular movie.   From his room, a hotel guest could select a\n\n17   movie via remote control from a list on his television.       The\n\n18   corresponding cassette player would start, and its output would\n\n19   be transmitted to that guest’s room.      During this playback, the\n\n20   movie selected was unavailable to other guests.     See id.    The\n\n21   court concluded that the transmissions made by this system were\n\n22   made to the public “because the relationship between the\n\n23   transmitter of the performance, On Command, and the audience,\n\n24   hotel guests, is a commercial, ‘public’ one regardless of where\n\n25   the viewing takes place.”    Id. at 790.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f1         Thus, according to the On Command court, any commercial\n\n2    transmission is a transmission “to the public.”   We find this\n\n3    interpretation untenable, as it completely rewrites the language\n\n4    of the statutory definition.    If Congress had wished to make all\n\n5    commercial transmissions public performances, the transmit clause\n\n6    would read: “to perform a work publicly means . . . to transmit a\n\n7    performance for commercial purposes.”   In addition, this\n\n8    interpretation overlooks, as Congress did not, the possibility\n\n9    that even non-commercial transmissions to the public may diminish\n\n10   the value of a copyright.   Finally, like Redd Horne, On Command\n\n11   is factually distinguishable, as successive transmissions to\n\n12   different viewers in that case could be made using a single copy\n\n13   of a given work.    Thus, at the moment of transmission, any of the\n\n14   hotel’s guests was capable of receiving a transmission made using\n\n15   a single copy of a given movie.   As a result, the district court\n\n16   in this case erred in relying on On Command.\n\n17        Plaintiffs also rely on Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor\n\n18   Products, Inc., 930 F.2d 277 (3d Cir. 1991), in which the Third\n\n19   Circuit interpreted § 106(3) of the Copyright Act, which gives\n\n20   the copyright holder the exclusive right “to distribute copies .\n\n21   . . of the copyrighted work to the public,” 17 U.S.C. § 106(3)\n\n22   (emphasis added).   The court concluded that “even one person can\n\n23   be the public for the purposes of section 106(3).”   Ford, 930\n\n24   F.2d at 299 (emphasis added).   Commentators have criticized the\n\n25   Ford court for divesting the phrase “to the public” of “all\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\f1    meaning whatsoever,” 2 Nimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 8.11[A], at 8-\n\n2    149, and the decision does appear to have that result.    Whether\n\n3    this result was justified in the context of the distribution\n\n4    right is not for us to decide in this case.   We merely note that\n\n5    we find no compelling reason, in the context of the transmit\n\n6    clause and the public performance right, to interpret the phrase\n\n7    “to the public” out of existence.\n\n8         In sum, we find that the transmit clause directs us to\n\n9    identify the potential audience of a given transmission, i.e.,\n\n10   the persons “capable of receiving” it, to determine whether that\n\n11   transmission is made “to the public.”   Because each RS-DVR\n\n12   playback transmission is made to a single subscriber using a\n\n13   single unique copy produced by that subscriber, we conclude that\n\n14   such transmissions are not performances “to the public,” and\n\n15   therefore do not infringe any exclusive right of public\n\n16   performance.   We base this decision on the application of\n\n17   undisputed facts; thus, Cablevision is entitled to summary\n\n18   judgment on this point.\n\n19        This holding, we must emphasize, does not generally permit\n\n20   content delivery networks to avoid all copyright liability by\n\n21   making copies of each item of content and associating one unique\n\n22   copy with each subscriber to the network, or by giving their\n\n23   subscribers the capacity to make their own individual copies.    We\n\n24   do not address whether such a network operator would be able to\n\n25   escape any other form of copyright liability, such as liability\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\f1    for unauthorized reproductions or liability for contributory\n\n2    infringement.\n\n3         In sum, because we find, on undisputed facts, that\n\n4    Cablevision’s proposed RS-DVR system would not directly infringe\n\n5    plaintiffs’ exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform\n\n6    their copyrighted works, we grant summary judgment in favor of\n\n7    Cablevision with respect to both rights.\n\n8                               CONCLUSION\n\n9         For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s award of\n\n10   summary judgment to the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the district\n\n11   court’s injunction against Cablevision is VACATED.   The case is\n\n12   REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f",

WALKER, JR., Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Cablevision Systems Corporation (\"Cablevision\") wants to market a new \"Remote Storage\" Digital Video Recorder system (\"RS-DVR\"), using a technology akin to both traditional, set-top digital video recorders, like TiVo (\"DVRs\"), and the video-on-demand (\"VOD\") services provided by many cable companies. Plaintiffs-Appellees produce copyrighted movies and television programs that they provide to Cablevision pursuant to numerous licensing agreements. They contend that Cablevision, through the operation of its RS-DVR system as proposed, would directly infringe their copyrights both by making unauthorized reproductions, and by engaging in public performances, of their copyrighted works. The material facts are not in dispute. Because we conclude that Cablevision would not directly infringe plaintiffs' rights under the Copyright Act by offering its RS-DVR system to consumers, we reverse the district court's award of summary judgment to plaintiffs, and we vacate its injunction against Cablevision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Today's television viewers increasingly use digital video recorders (\"DVRs\") instead of video cassette recorders (\"VCRs\") to record television programs and play them back later at their convenience. DVRs generally store recorded programming on an internal hard drive rather than a cassette. But, as this case demonstrates, the generic term \"DVR\" actually refers to a growing number of different devices and systems. Companies like TiVo sell a stand-alone DVR device that is typically connected to a user's cable box and television much like a VCR. Many cable companies also lease to their subscribers \"set-top storage DVRs,\" which combine many of the functions of a standard cable box and a stand-alone DVR in a single device.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> In March 2006, Cablevision, an operator of cable television systems, announced the advent of its new \"Remote Storage DVR System.\" As designed, the RS-DVR allows Cablevision customers who do not have a stand-alone DVR to record cable programming on central hard drives housed and maintained by Cablevision at a \"remote\" location. RS-DVR customers may then receive playback of those programs through their home television sets, using only a remote control and a standard cable box equipped with the RS-DVR software. Cablevision notified its content providers, including plaintiffs, of its plans to offer RS-DVR, but it did not seek any license from them to operate or sell the RS-DVR.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, which hold the copyrights to numerous movies and television programs, sued Cablevision for declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that Cablevision's proposed operation of the RS-DVR would directly infringe their exclusive rights to both reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works. Critically for our analysis here, plaintiffs alleged theories only of direct infringement, not contributory infringement, and defendants waived any defense based on fair use.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Denny Chin, <i>Judge</i>), awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from operating the RS-DVR system without licenses from its content providers. <i>See </i><i>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Cablevision Sys. Corp.</i> (<i>Cablevision I</i>), 478 F.Supp.2d 607 (S.D.N.Y.2007). At the outset, we think it helpful to an understanding of our decision to describe, in greater detail, both the RS-DVR and the district court's opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Operation of the RS-DVR System</h2>\n<p>Cable companies like Cablevision aggregate television programming from a wide variety of \"content providers\"the various broadcast and cable channels that produce or provide individual programsand transmit those programs into the homes of their subscribers via coaxial cable. At the outset of the transmission process, Cablevision gathers the content of the various television channels into a single stream of data. Generally, this stream is processed and transmitted to Cablevision's customers in real time. Thus, if a Cartoon Network program is scheduled to air Monday night at 8pm, Cartoon Network transmits that program's data to Cablevision and other cable companies nationwide at that time, and the cable companies immediately re-transmit the data to customers who subscribe to that channel.</p>\n<p>Under the new RS-DVR, this single stream of data is split into two streams. The first is routed immediately to customers as before. The second stream flows into a device called the Broadband Media Router (\"BMR\"), <i>id.</i> at 613, which buffers the data stream, reformats it, and sends it to the \"Arroyo Server,\" which consists, in relevant part, of two data buffers and a number of high-capacity hard disks. The entire stream of data moves to the first buffer (the \"primary ingest buffer\"), at which point the server automatically inquires as to whether any customers want to record any of that programming. If a customer has requested a particular program, the data for that program move from the primary buffer into a secondary buffer, and then onto a portion of one of the hard disks allocated to that customer. As new data flow into the primary buffer, they overwrite a corresponding quantity of data already on the buffer. The primary ingest buffer holds no more than 0.1 seconds of each channel's programming at any moment. Thus, every tenth of a second, the data residing on this buffer are automatically erased and replaced. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> data buffer in the BMR holds no more than 1.2 seconds of programming at any time. While buffering occurs at other points in the operation of the RS-DVR, only the BMR buffer and the primary ingest buffer are utilized absent any request from an individual subscriber.</p>\n<p>As the district court observed, \"the RS-DVR is not a single piece of equipment,\" but rather \"a complex system requiring numerous computers, processes, networks of cables, and facilities staffed by personnel twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.\" <i>Id.</i> at 612. To the customer, however, the processes of recording and playback on the RS-DVR are similar to that of a standard set-top DVR. Using a remote control, the customer can record programming by selecting a program in advance from an on-screen guide, or by pressing the record button while viewing a given program. A customer cannot, however, record the earlier portion of a program once it has begun. To begin playback, the customer selects the show from an on-screen list of previously recorded programs. <i>See id.</i> at 614-16. The principal difference in operation is that, instead of sending signals from the remote to an on-set box, the viewer sends signals from the remote, through the cable, to the Arroyo Server at Cablevision's central facility. <i>See id.</i> In this respect, RS-DVR more closely resembles a VOD service, whereby a cable subscriber uses his remote and cable box to request transmission of content, such as a movie, stored on computers at the cable company's facility. <i>Id.</i> at 612. But unlike a VOD service, RS-DVR users can only play content that they previously requested to be recorded.</p>\n<p>Cablevision has some control over the content available for recording: a customer can only record programs on the channels offered by Cablevision (assuming he subscribes to them). Cablevision can also modify the system to limit the number of channels available and considered doing so during development of the RS-DVR. <i>Id.</i> at 613.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>In the district court, plaintiffs successfully argued that Cablevision's proposed system would directly infringe their copyrights in three ways. First, by briefly storing data in the primary ingest buffer and other data buffers integral to the function of the RS-DVR, Cablevision would make copies of protected works and thereby directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive right of reproduction under the Copyright Act. Second, by copying programs onto the Arroyo Server hard disks (the \"playback copies\"), Cablevision would again directly infringe the reproduction right. And third, by transmitting the data from the Arroyo Server hard disks to its RS-DVR customers in response to a \"playback\" request, Cablevision would directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive right of public performance. <i>See id.</i> at 617. Agreeing with all three arguments, the district court awarded summary declaratory judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from operating the RS-DVR system without obtaining licenses from the plaintiff copyright holders.</p>\n<p>As to the buffer data, the district court rejected defendants' arguments 1) that the data were not \"fixed\" and therefore were not \"copies\" as defined in the Copyright Act, and 2) that any buffer copying was de minimis because the buffers stored only small amounts of data for very short periods of time. In rejecting the latter argument, the district court noted that the \"aggregate effect of the buffering\" was to reproduce the entirety of Cablevision's programming, and such copying \"can hardly be called de minimis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 621.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> On the issue of whether creation of the playback copies made Cablevision liable for direct infringement, the parties and the district court agreed that the dispositive question was \"<i>who</i> makes the copies\"? <i>Id.</i> at 617. Emphasizing Cablevision's \"unfettered discretion\" over the content available for recording, its ownership and maintenance of the RS-DVR components, and its \"continuing relationship\" with its RS-DVR customers, the district court concluded that \"the copying of programming to the RS-DVR's Arroyo servers ... would be done not by the customer but by Cablevision, albeit at the customer's request.\" <i>Id.</i> at 618, 620, 621.</p>\n<p>Finally, as to the public performance right, Cablevision conceded that, during the playback, \"the streaming of recorded programming in response to a customer's request is a performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622. Cablevision contended, however, that the work was performed not by Cablevision, but by the customer, an argument the district court rejected \"for the same reasons that [it] reject[ed] the argument that the customer is `doing' the copying involved in the RS-DVR.\" <i>Id.</i> Cablevision also argued that such a playback transmission was not \"to the public,\" and therefore not a public performance as defined in the Copyright Act, because it \"emanates from a distinct copy of a program uniquely associated with one customer's set-top box and intended for that customer's exclusive viewing in his or her home.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court disagreed, noting that \"Cablevision would transmit <i>the same program</i> to members of the public, who may receive the performance at different times, depending on whether they view the program in real time or at a later time as an RS-DVR playback.\" <i>Id.</i> at 623 (emphasis added). The district court also relied on a case from the Northern District of California, <i>On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,</i> 777 F.Supp. 787 (N.D.Cal.1991), which held that when the relationship between the transmitter and the audience of a performance is commercial, the transmission is \"to the public,\" <i>see </i><i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 623 (citing <i>On Command,</i> 777 F.Supp. at 790).</p>\n<p>Finding that the operation of the RS-DVR would infringe plaintiffs' copyrights, the district court awarded summary judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from copying or publicly performing plaintiffs' copyrighted works \"in connection with its proposed RS-DVR system,\" unless it obtained the necessary licenses. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 624. Cablevision appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.,</i> 448 F.3d 605, 607 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>\"Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants copyright holders a bundle of exclusive rights....\" <i>Id.</i> at 607-08. This case implicates two of those rights: the right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,\" and the right \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), (4). As discussed above, the district court found that Cablevision infringed the first right by 1) buffering the data from its programming stream and 2) copying content onto the Arroyo Server hard disks to enable playback of a program requested by an RS-DVR customer. In addition, the district court found that Cablevision would infringe the public performance right by transmitting a program to an RS-DVR customer in response to that customer's playback request. We address each of these three allegedly infringing acts in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> I. The Buffer Data</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that Cablevision, not any customer or other entity, takes the content from one stream of programming, after the split, and stores it, one small piece at a time, in the BMR buffer and the primary ingest buffer. As a result, the information is buffered before any customer requests a recording, and would be buffered even if no such request were made. The question is whether, by buffering the data that make up a given work, Cablevision \"reproduce[s]\" that work \"in copies,\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), and thereby infringes the copyright holder's reproduction right.</p>\n<p>\"Copies,\" as defined in the Copyright Act, \"are material objects ... in which a work is fixed by any method ... and from which the work can be ... reproduced.\" <i>Id.</i> § 101. The Act also provides that a work is \"`fixed' in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment ... is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be ... reproduced ... <i>for a period of more than transitory duration.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). We believe that this language plainly imposes two distinct but related requirements: the work must be embodied in a medium, i.e., placed in a medium such that it can be perceived, reproduced, etc., from that medium (the \"embodiment requirement\"), and it must remain thus embodied \"for a period of more than transitory duration\" (the \"duration requirement\"). <i>See</i> 2 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 8.02[B][3], at 8-32 (2007). Unless both requirements are met, the work is not \"fixed\" in the buffer, and, as a result, the buffer data is not a \"copy\" of the original work whose data is buffered.</p>\n<p>The district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement. As a result of this error, once it determined that the buffer data was \"[c]learly ... capable of being reproduced,\" i.e., that the work was embodied in the buffer, the district court concluded that the work was therefore \"fixed\" in the buffer, and that a copy had thus been made. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 621-22. In doing so, it relied on a line of cases beginning with <i>MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer Inc.,</i> 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir.1993). It also relied on the United States Copyright Office's 2001 report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which states, in essence, that an embodiment is fixed \"[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so fleetingly that <i>it cannot be copied.</i>\" U.S. Copyright Office, <i>DMCA Section 104 Report</i> 111 (Aug.2001) (<i>\"DMCA Report\"</i>) (emphasis added), <i>available at</i> http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/sec-104-report-vol-1.pdf.</p>\n<p>The district court's reliance on cases like <i>MAI Systems</i> is misplaced. In general, those cases conclude that an alleged copy is fixed without addressing the duration requirement; it does not follow, however, that those cases assume, much less establish, that such a requirement does not exist. Indeed, the duration requirement, by itself, was not at issue in <i>MAI Systems</i> and its progeny. As a result, they do not speak to the issues squarely before us here: If a work is only \"embodied\" in a medium for a period of transitory duration, can it be \"fixed\" in that medium, and thus a copy? And what constitutes a period \"of more than transitory duration\"?</p>\n<p>In <i>MAI Systems,</i> defendant Peak Computer, Inc., performed maintenance and repairs on computers made and sold by MAI Systems. In order to service a customer's computer, a Peak employee had to operate the computer and run the computer's copyrighted operating system software. <i>See MAI Sys.,</i> 991 F.2d at 513. The issue in <i>MAI Systems</i> was whether, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> by loading the software into the computer's RAM,<sup>[1]</sup> the repairman created a \"copy\" as defined in § 101. <i>See id.</i> at 517. The resolution of this issue turned on whether the software's embodiment in the computer's RAM was \"fixed,\" within the meaning of the same section. The Ninth Circuit concluded that</p>\n<blockquote>by showing that Peak loads the software into the RAM and is then able to view the system error log and diagnose the problem with the computer, MAI has adequately shown that the representation created in the RAM is \"sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 518 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 101).</p>\n<p>The <i>MAI Systems</i> court referenced the \"transitory duration\" language but did not discuss or analyze it. The opinion notes that the defendants \"vigorously\" argued that the program's embodiment in the RAM was not a copy, but it does not specify the arguments defendants made. <i>Id.</i> at 517. This omission suggests that the parties did not litigate the significance of the \"transitory duration\" language, and the court therefore had no occasion to address it. This is unsurprising, because it seems fair to assume that in these cases the program was embodied in the RAM for at least several minutes.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we construe <i>MAI Systems</i> and its progeny as holding that loading a program into a computer's RAM <i>can</i> result in copying that program. We do not read <i>MAI Systems</i> as holding that, as a matter of law, loading a program into a form of RAM <i>always</i> results in copying. Such a holding would read the \"transitory duration\" language out of the definition, and we do not believe our sister circuit would dismiss this statutory language without even discussing it. It appears the parties in <i>MAI Systems</i> simply did not dispute that the duration requirement was satisfied; this line of cases simply concludes that when a program is loaded into RAM, the embodiment requirement is satisfiedan important holding in itself, and one we see no reason to quibble with here.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>At least one court, relying on <i>MAI Systems</i> in a highly similar factual setting, has made this point explicitly. In <i>Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc. v. MAI Systems Corp.,</i> the district court expressly noted that the unlicensed user in that case ran copyrighted diagnostic software \"for minutes or longer,\" but that the program's embodiment in the computer's RAM might be too ephemeral to be fixed if the computer had been shut down \"within <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> seconds or fractions of a second\" after loading the copyrighted program. 845 F.Supp. 356, 363 (E.D.Va.1994). We have no quarrel with this reasoning; it merely makes explicit the reasoning that is implicit in the other <i>MAI Systems</i> cases. Accordingly, those cases provide no support for the conclusion that the definition of \"fixed\" does not include a duration requirement. <i>See </i><i>Webster v. Fall,</i> 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1924) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\").</p>\n<p>Nor does the Copyright Office's 2001 DMCA Report, also relied on by the district court in this case, explicitly suggest that the definition of \"fixed\" does not contain a duration requirement. However, as noted above, it does suggest that an embodiment is fixed \"[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so fleetingly that it cannot be copied, perceived or communicated.\" <i>DMCA Report, supra,</i> at 111. As we have stated, to determine whether a work is \"fixed\" in a given medium, the statutory language directs us to ask not only 1) whether a work is \"embodied\" in that medium, but also 2) whether it is embodied in the medium \"for a period of more than transitory duration.\" According to the Copyright Office, if the work is capable of being copied from that medium <i>for any amount of time,</i> the answer to both questions is \"yes.\" The problem with this interpretation is that it reads the \"transitory duration\" language out of the statute.</p>\n<p>We assume, as the parties do, that the Copyright Office's pronouncement deserves only <i>Skidmore</i> deference, deference based on its \"power to persuade.\" <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). And because the Office's interpretation does not explain why Congress would include language in a definition if it intended courts to ignore that language, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>In sum, no case law or other authority dissuades us from concluding that the definition of \"fixed\" imposes both an embodiment requirement and a duration requirement. <i>Accord </i><i>CoStar Group Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,</i> 373 F.3d 544, 551 (4th Cir. 2004) (while temporary reproductions \"may be made in this transmission process, they would appear not to be `fixed' in the sense that they are `of more than transitory duration'\"). We now turn to whether, in this case, those requirements are met by the buffer data.</p>\n<p>Cablevision does not seriously dispute that copyrighted works are \"embodied\" in the buffer. Data in the BMR buffer can be reformatted and transmitted to the other components of the RS-DVR system. Data in the primary ingest buffer can be copied onto the Arroyo hard disks if a user has requested a recording of that data. Thus, a work's \"embodiment\" in either buffer \"is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced,\" (as in the case of the ingest buffer) \"or otherwise communicated\" (as in the BMR buffer). 17 U.S.C. § 101. The result might be different if only a single second of a much longer work was placed in the buffer in isolation. In such a situation, it might be reasonable to conclude that only a minuscule portion of a work, rather than \"a work\" was embodied in the buffer. Here, however, where every second of an entire work is placed, one second at a time, in the buffer, we conclude that the work is embodied in the buffer.</p>\n<p>Does any such embodiment last \"for a period of more than transitory duration\"? <i>Id.</i> No bit of data remains in any buffer for more than a fleeting 1.2 seconds. And unlike the data in cases like <i>MAI</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> <i>Systems,</i> which remained embodied in the computer's RAM memory until the user turned the computer off, each bit of data here is rapidly and automatically overwritten as soon as it is processed. While our inquiry is necessarily fact-specific, and other factors not present here may alter the duration analysis significantly, these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a \"transitory\" period, thus failing the duration requirement.</p>\n<p>Against this evidence, plaintiffs argue only that the duration is not transitory because the data persist \"long enough for Cablevision to make reproductions from them.\" Br. of Pls.-Appellees the Cartoon Network et al. at 51. As we have explained above, however, this reasoning impermissibly reads the duration language out of the statute, and we reject it. Given that the data reside in no buffer for more than 1.2 seconds before being automatically overwritten, and in the absence of compelling arguments to the contrary, we believe that the copyrighted works here are not \"embodied\" in the buffers for a period of more than transitory duration, and are therefore not \"fixed\" in the buffers. Accordingly, the acts of buffering in the operation of the RS-DVR do not create copies, as the Copyright Act defines that term. Our resolution of this issue renders it unnecessary for us to determine whether any copies produced by buffering data would be de minimis, and we express no opinion on that question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Direct Liability for Creating the Playback Copies</h2>\n<p>In most copyright disputes, the allegedly infringing act and the identity of the infringer are never in doubt. These cases turn on whether the conduct in question does, in fact, infringe the plaintiff's copyright. In this case, however, the core of the dispute is over the authorship of the infringing conduct. After an RS-DVR subscriber selects a program to record, and that program airs, a copy of the programa copyrighted workresides on the hard disks of Cablevision's Arroyo Server, its creation unauthorized by the copyright holder. The question is <i>who</i> made this copy. If it is Cablevision, plaintiffs' theory of direct infringement succeeds; if it is the customer, plaintiffs' theory fails because Cablevision would then face, at most, secondary liability, a theory of liability expressly disavowed by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Few cases examine the line between direct and contributory liability. Both parties cite a line of cases beginning with <i>Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services,</i> 907 F.Supp. 1361 (N.D.Cal.1995). In <i>Netcom,</i> a third-party customer of the defendant Internet service provider (\"ISP\") posted a copyrighted work that was automatically reproduced by the defendant's computer. The district court refused to impose direct liability on the ISP, reasoning that \"[a]lthough copyright is a strict liability statute, there should still be some element of volition or causation which is lacking where a defendant's system is merely used to create a copy by a third party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1370. Recently, the Fourth Circuit endorsed the <i>Netcom</i> decision, noting that</p>\n<blockquote>to establish <i>direct</i> liability under ... the Act, something more must be shown than mere ownership of a machine used by others to make illegal copies. There must be actual infringing conduct with a nexus sufficiently close and causal to the illegal copying that one could conclude that the machine owner himself trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright owner.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,</i> 373 F.3d 544, 550 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> Here, the district court pigeon-holed the conclusions reached in <i>Netcom</i> and its progeny as \"premised on the unique attributes of the Internet.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. While the <i>Netcom</i> court was plainly concerned with a theory of direct liability that would effectively \"hold the entire Internet liable\" for the conduct of a single user, 907 F.Supp. at 1372, its reasoning and conclusions, consistent with precedents of this court and the Supreme Court, and with the text of the Copyright Act, transcend the Internet. Like the Fourth Circuit, we reject the contention that \"the <i>Netcom</i> decision was driven by expedience and that its holding is inconsistent with the established law of copyright,\" <i>CoStar,</i> 373 F.3d at 549, and we find it \"a particularly rational interpretation of § 106,\" <i>id.</i> at 551, rather than a special-purpose rule applicable only to ISPs.</p>\n<p>When there is a dispute as to the author of an allegedly infringing instance of reproduction, <i>Netcom</i> and its progeny direct our attention to the volitional conduct that causes the copy to be made. There are only two instances of volitional conduct in this case: Cablevision's conduct in designing, housing, and maintaining a system that exists only to produce a copy, and a customer's conduct in ordering that system to produce a copy of a specific program. In the case of a VCR, it seems clear  and we know of no case holding otherwise  that the operator of the VCR, the person who actually presses the button to make the recording, supplies the necessary element of volition, not the person who manufactures, maintains, or, if distinct from the operator, owns the machine. We do not believe that an RS-DVR customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a VCR user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customer's command.</p>\n<p>The district court emphasized the fact that copying is \"instrumental\" rather than \"incidental\" to the function of the RS-DVR system. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. While that may distinguish the RS-DVR from the ISPs in <i>Netcom</i> and <i>CoStar,</i> it does not distinguish the RS-DVR from a VCR, a photocopier, or even a typical copy shop. And the parties do not seem to contest that a company that merely makes photocopiers available to the public on its premises, without more, is not subject to liability for direct infringement for reproductions made by customers using those copiers. They only dispute whether Cablevision is similarly situated to such a proprietor.</p>\n<p>The district court found Cablevision analogous to a copy shop that makes course packs for college professors. In the leading case involving such a shop, for example, \"[t]he professor [gave] the copyshop the materials of which the coursepack [was] to be made up, and the copyshop [did] the rest.\" <i>Princeton Univ. Press v. Mich. Document Servs.,</i> 99 F.3d 1381, 1384 (6th Cir.1996) (en banc). There did not appear to be any serious dispute in that case that the shop itself was directly liable for reproducing copyrighted works. The district court here found that Cablevision, like this copy shop, would be \"doing\" the copying, albeit \"at the customer's behest.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620.</p>\n<p>But because volitional conduct is an important element of direct liability, the district court's analogy is flawed. In determining who actually \"makes\" a copy, a significant difference exists between making a request to a human employee, who then volitionally operates the copying system to make the copy, and issuing a command directly to a system, which automatically obeys commands and engages in no volitional conduct. In cases like <i>Princeton</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> <i>University Press,</i> the defendants operated a copying device and sold the product they made using that device. <i>See</i> 99 F.3d at 1383 (\"The corporate defendant ... is a commercial copyshop that reproduced substantial segments of copyrighted works of scholarship, bound the copies into `coursepacks,' and sold the coursepacks to students....\"). Here, by selling access to a system that automatically produces copies on command, Cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises, and it seems incorrect to say, without more, that such a proprietor \"makes\" any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers. <i>See </i><i>Netcom,</i> 907 F.Supp. at 1369. Some courts have held to the contrary, but they do not explicitly explain why, and we find them unpersuasive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elektra Records Co. v. Gem Elec. Distribs., Inc.,</i> 360 F.Supp. 821, 823 (E.D.N.Y.1973) (concluding that, \"regardless\" of whether customers or defendants' employees operated the tape-copying machines at defendants' stores, defendant had actively infringed copyrights).</p>\n<p>The district court also emphasized Cablevision's \"unfettered discretion in selecting the programming that it would make available for recording.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. This conduct is indeed more proximate to the creation of illegal copying than, say, operating an ISP or opening a copy shop, where all copied content was supplied by the customers themselves or other third parties. Nonetheless, we do not think it sufficiently proximate to the copying to displace the customer as the person who \"makes\" the copies when determining liability under the Copyright Act. Cablevision, we note, also has subscribers who use home VCRs or DVRs (like TiVo), and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers. But this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves. Cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air, if at all. In this respect, Cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the VOD context, where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing. For these reasons, we are not inclined to say that Cablevision, rather than the user, \"does\" the copying produced by the RS-DVR system. As a result, we find that the district court erred in concluding that Cablevision, rather than its RS-DVR customers, makes the copies carried out by the RS-DVR system.</p>\n<p>Our refusal to find Cablevision directly liable on these facts is buttressed by the existence and contours of the Supreme Court's doctrine of contributory liability in the copyright context. After all, the purpose of any causation-based liability doctrine is to identify the actor (or actors) whose \"conduct has been so significant and important a cause that [he or she] should be legally responsible.\" W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on Torts</i> § 42, at 273 (5th ed.1984). But here, to the extent that we may construe the boundaries of direct liability more narrowly, the doctrine of contributory liability stands ready to provide adequate protection to copyrighted works.</p>\n<p>Most of the facts found dispositive by the district courte.g., Cablevision's \"continuing relationship\" with its RS-DVR customers, its control over recordable content, and the \"instrumental[ity]\" of copying to the RS-DVR system, <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 618-20seem to us more relevant to the question of contributory liability. In <i>Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,</i> the lack of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> \"ongoing relationship\" between Sony and its VCR customers supported the Court's conclusion that it should not impose <i>contributory</i> liability on Sony for any infringing copying done by Sony VCR owners. 464 U.S. 417, 437-38, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984). The <i>Sony</i> Court did deem it \"just\" to impose liability on a party in a \"position to control\" the infringing uses of another, but as a contributory, not direct, infringer. <i>Id.</i> at 437, 104 S.Ct. 774. And asking whether copying copyrighted material is only \"incidental\" to a given technology is akin to asking whether that technology has \"commercially significant noninfringing uses,\" another inquiry the <i>Sony</i> Court found relevant to whether imposing <i>contributory</i> liability was just. <i>Id.</i> at 442, 104 S.Ct. 774.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's desire to maintain a meaningful distinction between direct and contributory copyright infringement is consistent with congressional intent. The Patent Act, unlike the Copyright Act, expressly provides that someone who \"actively induces infringement of a patent\" is \"liable as an infringer,\" 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), just like someone who commits the underlying infringing act by \"us[ing]\" a patented invention without authorization, <i>id.</i> § 271(a). In contrast, someone who merely \"sells ... a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process\" faces only liability as a \"contributory infringer.\" <i>Id.</i> § 271(c). If Congress had meant to assign direct liability to both the person who actually commits a copyright-infringing act and any person who actively induces that infringement, the Patent Act tells us that it knew how to draft a statute that would have this effect. Because Congress did not do so, the <i>Sony</i> Court concluded that \"[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another.\" 464 U.S. at 434, 104 S.Ct. 774. Furthermore, in cases like <i>Sony,</i> the Supreme Court has strongly signaled its intent to use the doctrine of contributory infringement, not direct infringement, to \"identify[] the circumstances in which it is just to hold one individual accountable for the actions of another.\" <i>Id.</i> at 435, 104 S.Ct. 774. Thus, although <i>Sony</i> warns us that \"the lines between direct infringement, contributory infringement, and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn,\" <i>id.</i> at 435 n. 17, 104 S.Ct. 774 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), that decision does not absolve us of our duty to discern where that line falls in cases, like this one, that require us to decide the question.</p>\n<p>The district court apparently concluded that Cablevision's operation of the RS-DVR system would contribute in such a major way to the copying done by another that it made sense to say that Cablevision was a direct infringer, and thus, in effect, was \"doing\" the relevant copying. There are certainly other cases, not binding on us, that follow this approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Playboy Enters. v. Russ Hardenburgh, Inc.,</i> 982 F.Supp. 503, 513 (N.D.Ohio 1997) (noting that defendant ISP's encouragement of its users to copy protected files was \"crucial\" to finding that it was a direct infringer). We need not decide today whether one's contribution to the creation of an infringing copy may be so great that it warrants holding that party directly liable for the infringement, even though another party has actually made the copy. We conclude only that on the facts of this case, copies produced by the RS-DVR system are \"made\" by the RS-DVR customer, and Cablevision's contribution to this reproduction by providing the system does not warrant the imposition of direct liability. Therefore, Cablevision is entitled to summary judgment on this point, and the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> III. Transmission of RS-DVR Playback</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' final theory is that Cablevision will violate the Copyright Act by engaging in unauthorized public performances of their works through the playback of the RS-DVR copies. The Act grants a copyright owner the exclusive right, \"in the case of ... motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(4). Section 101, the definitional section of the Act, explains that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o perform or display a work \"publicly\" means (1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or (2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 101.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that this case does not implicate clause (1). Accordingly, we ask whether these facts satisfy the second, \"transmit clause\" of the public performance definition: Does Cablevision \"transmit... a performance ... of the work ... to the public\"? <i>Id.</i> No one disputes that the RS-DVR playback results in the transmission of a performance of a workthe transmission from the Arroyo Server to the customer's television set. Cablevision contends that (1) the RS-DVR customer, rather than Cablevision, does the transmitting and thus the performing and (2) the transmission is not \"to the public\" under the transmit clause.</p>\n<p>As to Cablevision's first argument, we note that our conclusion in Part II that the customer, not Cablevision, \"does\" the copying does not dictate a parallel conclusion that the customer, and not Cablevision, \"performs\" the copyrighted work. The definitions that delineate the contours of the reproduction and public performance rights vary in significant ways. For example, the statute defines the verb \"perform\" and the noun \"copies,\" but not the verbs \"reproduce\" or \"copy.\" <i>Id.</i> We need not address Cablevision's first argument further because, even if we assume that Cablevision makes the transmission when an RS-DVR playback occurs, we find that the RS-DVR playback, as described here, does not involve the transmission of a performance \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>The statute itself does not expressly define the term \"performance\" or the phrase \"to the public.\" It does explain that a transmission may be \"to the public ... whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\" <i>Id.</i> This plain language instructs us that, in determining whether a transmission is \"to the public,\" it is of no moment that the potential recipients of the transmission are in different places, or that they may receive the transmission at different times. The implication from this same language, however, is that it is relevant, in determining whether a transmission is made to the public, to discern who is \"capable of receiving\" the performance being transmitted. The fact that the statute says \"capable of receiving the performance,\" instead of \"capable of receiving the transmission,\" underscores the fact that a transmission of a performance is itself a performance. <i>Cf. </i><i>Buck v. Jewell-La Salle Realty Co.,</i> 283 U.S. 191, 197-98, 51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed. 971 (1931).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> The legislative history of the transmit clause supports this interpretation. The House Report on the 1976 Copyright Act states that</p>\n<blockquote>[u]nder the bill, as under the present law, a performance made available <i>by transmission to the public at large</i> is \"public\" even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the <i>potential recipients</i> was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply whenever the <i>potential recipients of the transmission</i> represent a limited segment of the public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television service.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64-65 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5678 (emphases added).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also reference a 1967 House Report, issued nearly a decade before the Act we are interpreting, stating that the same principles apply where the transmission is \"<i>capable of reaching</i> different recipients at different times, as in the case of sounds or images stored in an information system and <i>capable of being performed or displayed</i> at the initiative of individual members of the public.\" H.R.Rep. No. 90-83, at 29 (1967) (emphases added). We question how much deference this report deserves. But we need not belabor the point here, as the 1967 report is consistent with both legislative history contemporaneous with the Act's passage and our own interpretation of the statute's plain meaning.</p>\n<p>From the foregoing, it is evident that the transmit clause directs us to examine who precisely is \"capable of receiving\" a particular transmission of a performance. Cablevision argues that, because each RS-DVR transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work, made by an individual subscriber, one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscriber's cable box, only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given RS-DVR transmission. This argument accords with the language of the transmit clause, which, as described above, directs us to consider the potential audience of a given transmission. We are unpersuaded by the district court's reasoning and the plaintiffs' arguments that we should consider a larger potential audience in determining whether a transmission is \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>The district court, in deciding whether the RS-DVR playback of a program to a particular customer is \"to the public,\" apparently considered all of Cablevision's customers who subscribe to the channel airing that program and all of Cablevision's RS-DVR subscribers who request a copy of that program. Thus, it concluded that the RS-DVR playbacks constituted public performances because \"Cablevision would transmit the <i>same program</i> to members of the public, who may receive the performance at different times, depending on whether they view the program in real time or at a later time as an RS-DVR playback.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 623 (emphasis added). In essence, the district court suggested that, in considering whether a transmission is \"to the public,\" we consider not the potential audience of a particular transmission, but the potential audience of the underlying work (i.e., \"the program\") whose content is being transmitted.</p>\n<p>We cannot reconcile the district court's approach with the language of the transmit clause. That clause speaks of people capable of receiving a particular \"transmission\" or \"performance,\" and not of the potential audience of a particular \"work.\" Indeed, such an approach would render the \"to the public\" language surplusage. Doubtless the <i>potential</i> audience for every <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> copyrighted audiovisual work is the general public. As a result, any transmission of the content of a copyrighted work would constitute a public performance under the district court's interpretation. But the transmit clause obviously contemplates the existence of non-public transmissions; if it did not, Congress would have stopped drafting that clause after \"performance.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, plaintiffs offer a slight variation of this interpretation. They argue that both in its real-time cablecast and via the RS-DVR playback, Cablevision is in fact transmitting the \"same performance\" of a given work: the performance of the work that occurs when the programming service supplying Cablevision's content transmits that content to Cablevision and the service's other licensees. <i>See</i> Br. of Pls.-Appellees Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. et al. at 27 (\"Fox Br.\") (\"The critical factor ... is that the same <i>performance</i> is transmitted to different subscribers at different times .... more specifically, the <i>performance</i> of that program <i>by HBO or another programming service.</i>\" (third emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Thus, according to plaintiffs, when Congress says that to perform a work publicly means to transmit ... a performance ... to the public, they really meant \"transmit... the `original performance' ... to the public.\" The implication of this theory is that to determine whether a given transmission of a performance is \"to the public,\" we would consider not only the potential audience of that transmission, but also the potential audience of any transmission of the same underlying \"original\" performance.</p>\n<p>Like the district court's interpretation, this view obviates any possibility of a purely private transmission. Furthermore, it makes Cablevision's liability depend, in part, on the actions of legal strangers. Assume that HBO transmits a copyrighted work to both Cablevision and Comcast. Cablevision merely retransmits the work from one Cablevision facility to another, while Comcast retransmits the program to its subscribers. Under plaintiffs' interpretation, Cablevision would still be transmitting the performance to the public, solely because Comcast has transmitted the same underlying performance to the public. Similarly, a hapless customer who records a program in his den and later transmits the recording to a television in his bedroom would be liable for publicly performing the work simply because some other party had once transmitted the same underlying performance to the public.</p>\n<p>We do not believe Congress intended such odd results. Although the transmit clause is not a model of clarity, we believe that when Congress speaks of transmitting a performance to the public, it refers to the performance created by the act of transmission. Thus, HBO transmits its own performance of a work when it transmits to Cablevision, and Cablevision transmits its own performance of the same work when it retransmits the feed from HBO.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we believe it would be inconsistent with our own transmit clause jurisprudence to consider the potential audience of an upstream transmission by a third party when determining whether a defendant's own subsequent transmission of a performance is \"to the public.\" In <i>National Football League v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture</i> (NFL), 211 F.3d 10 (2000), we examined the transmit clause in the context of satellite television provider PrimeTime, which captured protected content in the United States from the NFL, transmitted it from the United States to a satellite (\"the uplink\"), and then transmitted it from the satellite to subscribers in both the United States and Canada (\"the downlink\"). PrimeTime had a license to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> transmit to its U.S. customers, but not its Canadian customers. It argued that although the downlink transmission to its Canadian subscribers was a public performance, it could not be held liable for that act because it occurred entirely outside of the United States and therefore was not subject to the strictures of the Copyright Act. It also argued that the uplink transmission was not a public performance because it was a transmission to a single satellite. <i>See id.</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>The <i>NFL</i> court did not question the first assumption, but it flatly rejected the second on a specific and germane ground:</p>\n<blockquote>We believe the most logical interpretation of the Copyright Act is to hold that a public performance or display includes each step in the process by which a protected work wends its way to its audience. Under that analysis, it is clear that PrimeTime's uplink transmission of signals captured in the United States is a step in the process by which NFL's protected work wends its way <i>to a public audience.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 13 (emphasis added) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Thus, while the uplink transmission that took place in the United States was not, in itself, \"to the public,\" the <i>NFL</i> court deemed it so because it ultimately resulted in an undisputed public performance. Notably, the <i>NFL</i> court did not base its decision on the fact that an upstream transmission by another party (the NFL) might have been to the public. Nor did the court base its decision on the fact that Primetime simultaneously transmitted a performance of the work to the public in the United States. Because <i>NFL</i> directs us to look downstream, rather than upstream or laterally, to determine whether any link in a chain of transmissions made by a party constitutes a public performance, we reject plaintiffs' contention that we examine the potential recipients of the content provider's initial transmission to determine who is capable of receiving the RS-DVR playback transmission.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also rely on <i>NFL</i> for the proposition that Cablevision publicly performs a work when it splits its programming stream and transmits the second stream to the RS-DVR system. Because <i>NFL</i> only supports that conclusion if we determine that the final transmission in the chain (i.e., the RS-DVR playback transmission) is \"to the public,\" plaintiffs' reliance on <i>NFL</i> is misplaced. <i>NFL</i> dealt with a chain of transmissions whose final link was undisputedly a public performance. It therefore does not guide our current inquiry.</p>\n<p>In sum, none of the arguments advanced by plaintiffs or the district court alters our conclusion that, under the transmit clause, we must examine the potential audience of a given transmission by an alleged infringer to determine whether that transmission is \"to the public.\" And because the RS-DVR system, as designed, only makes transmissions to one subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber, we believe that the universe of people capable of receiving an RS-DVR transmission is the single subscriber whose self-made copy is used to create that transmission.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend that it is \"wholly irrelevant, in determining the existence of a public performance, whether `unique' <i>copies</i> of the same work are used to make the transmissions.\" Fox Br. at 27. But plaintiffs cite no authority for this contention. And our analysis of the transmit clause suggests that, in general, any factor that limits the <i>potential</i> audience of a transmission is relevant.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, no transmission of an audiovisual work can be made, we assume, without using a copy of that work: to transmit a performance of a movie, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> example, the transmitter generally must obtain a copy of that movie. As a result, in the context of movies, television programs, and other audiovisual works, the right of reproduction can reinforce and protect the right of public performance. If the owner of a copyright believes he is injured by a particular transmission of a performance of his work, he may be able to seek redress not only for the infringing transmission, but also for the underlying copying that facilitated the transmission. Given this interplay between the various rights in this context, it seems quite consistent with the Act to treat a transmission made using Copy A as distinct from one made using Copy B, just as we would treat a transmission made by Cablevision as distinct from an otherwise identical transmission made by Comcast. Both factorsthe identity of the transmitter and the source material of the transmissionlimit the potential audience of a transmission in this case and are therefore germane in determining whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, we believe that <i>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc.,</i> 749 F.2d 154 (3d Cir.1984), relied on by both plaintiffs and the district court, supports our decision to accord significance to the existence and use of distinct copies in our transmit clause analysis. In that case, defendant operated a video rental store, Maxwell's, which also housed a number of small private booths containing seats and a television. Patrons would select a film, enter the booth, and close the door. An employee would then load a copy of the requested movie into a bank of VCRs at the front of the store and push play, thereby transmitting the content of the tape to the television in the viewing booth. <i>See id.</i> at 156-57.</p>\n<p>The Third Circuit found that defendants' conduct constituted a public performance under both clauses of the statutory definition. In concluding that Maxwell's violated the transmit clause, that court explicitly relied on the fact that defendants showed the same copy of a work seriatim to its clientele, and it quoted a treatise emphasizing the same fact:</p>\n<blockquote>Professor Nimmer's examination of this definition is particularly pertinent: \"<i>if the same copy</i> ... of a given work is repeatedly played (<i>i.e.,</i> `performed') by different members of the public, albeit at different times, this constitutes a `public' performance.\" 2 M. Nimmer, § 8.14[C][3], at 8-142 (emphasis in original).... Although Maxwell's has only one copy of each film, it shows each copy repeatedly to different members of the public. This constitutes a public performance.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 159 (first omission in original).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither the <i>Redd Horne</i> court nor Prof. Nimmer explicitly explains <i>why</i> the use of a distinct copy affects the transmit clause inquiry. But our independent analysis confirms the soundness of their intuition: the use of a unique copy may limit the potential audience of a transmission and is therefore relevant to whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\" Plaintiffs' unsupported arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p>Given that each RS-DVR transmission is made to a given subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber, we conclude that such a transmission is not \"to the public,\" without analyzing the contours of that phrase in great detail. No authority cited by the parties or the district court persuades us to the contrary.</p>\n<p>In addition to <i>Redd Horne,</i> the district court also cited and analyzed <i>On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,</i> 777 F.Supp. 787 (N.D.Cal. 1991), in its transmit clause analysis. In that case, defendant On Command developed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> and sold \"a system for the electronic delivery of movie video tapes,\" which it sold to hotels. <i>Id.</i> at 788. The hub of the system was a bank of video cassette players, each containing a copy of a particular movie. From his room, a hotel guest could select a movie via remote control from a list on his television. The corresponding cassette player would start, and its output would be transmitted to that guest's room. During this playback, the movie selected was unavailable to other guests. <i>See id.</i> The court concluded that the transmissions made by this system were made to the public \"because the relationship between the transmitter of the performance, On Command, and the audience, hotel guests, is a commercial, `public' one regardless of where the viewing takes place.\" <i>Id.</i> at 790.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to the <i>On Command</i> court, any commercial transmission is a transmission \"to the public.\" We find this interpretation untenable, as it completely rewrites the language of the statutory definition. If Congress had wished to make all commercial transmissions public performances, the transmit clause would read: \"to perform a work publicly means ... to transmit a performance for commercial purposes.\" In addition, this interpretation overlooks, as Congress did not, the possibility that even non-commercial transmissions to the public may diminish the value of a copyright. Finally, like <i>Redd Horne, On Command</i> is factually distinguishable, as successive transmissions to different viewers in that case could be made using a single copy of a given work. Thus, at the moment of transmission, any of the hotel's guests was capable of receiving a transmission made using a single copy of a given movie. As a result, the district court in this case erred in relying on <i>On Command.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also rely on <i>Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Products, Inc.,</i> 930 F.2d 277 (3d Cir.1991), in which the Third Circuit interpreted § 106(3) of the Copyright Act, which gives the copyright holder the exclusive right \"to distribute copies ... of the copyrighted work <i>to the public,</i>\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) (emphasis added). The court concluded that \"even one person can be the public <i>for the purposes of section 106(3).</i>\" <i>Ford,</i> 930 F.2d at 299 (emphasis added). Commentators have criticized the <i>Ford</i> court for divesting the phrase \"to the public\" of \"all meaning whatsoever,\" 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 8.11[A], at 8-149, and the decision does appear to have that result. Whether this result was justified in the context of the distribution right is not for us to decide in this case. We merely note that we find no compelling reason, in the context of the transmit clause and the public performance right, to interpret the phrase \"to the public\" out of existence.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find that the transmit clause directs us to identify the potential audience of a given transmission, i.e., the persons \"capable of receiving\" it, to determine whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\" Because each RS-DVR playback transmission is made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber, we conclude that such transmissions are not performances \"to the public,\" and therefore do not infringe any exclusive right of public performance. We base this decision on the application of undisputed facts; thus, Cablevision is entitled to summary judgment on this point.</p>\n<p>This holding, we must emphasize, does not generally permit content delivery networks to avoid all copyright liability by making copies of each item of content and associating one unique copy with each subscriber to the network, or by giving their subscribers the capacity to make their own individual copies. We do not address whether such a network operator would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> able to escape any other form of copyright liability, such as liability for unauthorized reproductions or liability for contributory infringement.</p>\n<p>In sum, because we find, on undisputed facts, that Cablevision's proposed RS-DVR system would not directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works, we grant summary judgment in favor of Cablevision with respect to both rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's award of summary judgment to the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the district court's injunction against Cablevision is VACATED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To run a computer program, the data representing that program must be transferred from a data storage medium (such as a floppy disk or a hard drive) to a form of Random Access Memory (\"RAM\") where the data can be processed. The data buffers at issue here are also a form of RAM.</p>\n<p>[2]  The same reasoning also distinguishes this court's opinion in <i>Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publishing Co.,</i> 158 F.3d 693 (2d Cir. 1998). Language in that opinion, taken out of context, suggests that the definition of \"fixed\" imposes only an embodiment requirement: \"Under § 101's definition of `copies,' a work satisfies the fixation requirement when it is fixed in a material object from which it can be perceived or communicated directly or with the aid of a machine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702. Like the <i>MAI Systems</i> cases, <i>Matthew Bender</i> only addresses the embodiment requirement: specifically, whether West's copyrighted arrangement of judicial opinions was \"embedded\" in a CD-ROM compilation of opinions when the cases were normally arranged differently but could be manipulated by the user to replicate West's copyrighted arrangement. <i>Id.</i> at 703. The opinion merely quotes the duration language without discussing it, <i>see id.</i> at 702; that case therefore does not compel us to conclude that the definition of \"fixed\" does not impose a duration requirement.</p>\n\n</div>",

WALKER, JR., Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Cablevision Systems Corporation (\"Cablevision\") wants to market a new \"Remote Storage\" Digital Video Recorder system (\"RS-DVR\"), using a technology akin to both traditional, set-top digital video recorders, like TiVo (\"DVRs\"), and the video-on-demand (\"VOD\") services provided by many cable companies. Plaintiffs-Appellees produce copyrighted movies and television programs that they provide to Cablevision pursuant to numerous licensing agreements. They contend that Cablevision, through the operation of its RS-DVR system as proposed, would directly infringe their copyrights both by making unauthorized reproductions, and by engaging in public performances, of their copyrighted works. The material facts are not in dispute. Because we conclude that Cablevision would not directly infringe plaintiffs' rights under the Copyright Act by offering its RS-DVR system to consumers, we reverse the district court's award of summary judgment to plaintiffs, and we vacate its injunction against Cablevision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Today's television viewers increasingly use digital video recorders (\"DVRs\") instead of video cassette recorders (\"VCRs\") to record television programs and play them back later at their convenience. DVRs generally store recorded programming on an internal hard drive rather than a cassette. But, as this case demonstrates, the generic term \"DVR\" actually refers to a growing number of different devices and systems. Companies like TiVo sell a stand-alone DVR device that is typically connected to a user's cable box and television much like a VCR. Many cable companies also lease to their subscribers \"set-top storage DVRs,\" which combine many of the functions of a standard cable box and a stand-alone DVR in a single device.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> In March 2006, Cablevision, an operator of cable television systems, announced the advent of its new \"Remote Storage DVR System.\" As designed, the RS-DVR allows Cablevision customers who do not have a stand-alone DVR to record cable programming on central hard drives housed and maintained by Cablevision at a \"remote\" location. RS-DVR customers may then receive playback of those programs through their home television sets, using only a remote control and a standard cable box equipped with the RS-DVR software. Cablevision notified its content providers, including plaintiffs, of its plans to offer RS-DVR, but it did not seek any license from them to operate or sell the RS-DVR.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs, which hold the copyrights to numerous movies and television programs, sued Cablevision for declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that Cablevision's proposed operation of the RS-DVR would directly infringe their exclusive rights to both reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works. Critically for our analysis here, plaintiffs alleged theories only of direct infringement, not contributory infringement, and defendants waived any defense based on fair use.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Denny Chin, <i>Judge</i>), awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from operating the RS-DVR system without licenses from its content providers. <i>See </i><i>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Cablevision Sys. Corp.</i> (<i>Cablevision I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575125\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575125/twentieth-century-fox-film-v-cablevision-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (S.D.N.Y.2007). At the outset, we think it helpful to an understanding of our decision to describe, in greater detail, both the RS-DVR and the district court's opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Operation of the RS-DVR System</h2>\n<p>Cable companies like Cablevision aggregate television programming from a wide variety of \"content providers\"the various broadcast and cable channels that produce or provide individual programsand transmit those programs into the homes of their subscribers via coaxial cable. At the outset of the transmission process, Cablevision gathers the content of the various television channels into a single stream of data. Generally, this stream is processed and transmitted to Cablevision's customers in real time. Thus, if a Cartoon Network program is scheduled to air Monday night at 8pm, Cartoon Network transmits that program's data to Cablevision and other cable companies nationwide at that time, and the cable companies immediately re-transmit the data to customers who subscribe to that channel.</p>\n<p>Under the new RS-DVR, this single stream of data is split into two streams. The first is routed immediately to customers as before. The second stream flows into a device called the Broadband Media Router (\"BMR\"), <i>id.</i> at 613, which buffers the data stream, reformats it, and sends it to the \"Arroyo Server,\" which consists, in relevant part, of two data buffers and a number of high-capacity hard disks. The entire stream of data moves to the first buffer (the \"primary ingest buffer\"), at which point the server automatically inquires as to whether any customers want to record any of that programming. If a customer has requested a particular program, the data for that program move from the primary buffer into a secondary buffer, and then onto a portion of one of the hard disks allocated to that customer. As new data flow into the primary buffer, they overwrite a corresponding quantity of data already on the buffer. The primary ingest buffer holds no more than 0.1 seconds of each channel's programming at any moment. Thus, every tenth of a second, the data residing on this buffer are automatically erased and replaced. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> data buffer in the BMR holds no more than 1.2 seconds of programming at any time. While buffering occurs at other points in the operation of the RS-DVR, only the BMR buffer and the primary ingest buffer are utilized absent any request from an individual subscriber.</p>\n<p>As the district court observed, \"the RS-DVR is not a single piece of equipment,\" but rather \"a complex system requiring numerous computers, processes, networks of cables, and facilities staffed by personnel twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.\" <i>Id.</i> at 612. To the customer, however, the processes of recording and playback on the RS-DVR are similar to that of a standard set-top DVR. Using a remote control, the customer can record programming by selecting a program in advance from an on-screen guide, or by pressing the record button while viewing a given program. A customer cannot, however, record the earlier portion of a program once it has begun. To begin playback, the customer selects the show from an on-screen list of previously recorded programs. <i>See id.</i> at 614-16. The principal difference in operation is that, instead of sending signals from the remote to an on-set box, the viewer sends signals from the remote, through the cable, to the Arroyo Server at Cablevision's central facility. <i>See id.</i> In this respect, RS-DVR more closely resembles a VOD service, whereby a cable subscriber uses his remote and cable box to request transmission of content, such as a movie, stored on computers at the cable company's facility. <i>Id.</i> at 612. But unlike a VOD service, RS-DVR users can only play content that they previously requested to be recorded.</p>\n<p>Cablevision has some control over the content available for recording: a customer can only record programs on the channels offered by Cablevision (assuming he subscribes to them). Cablevision can also modify the system to limit the number of channels available and considered doing so during development of the RS-DVR. <i>Id.</i> at 613.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The District Court's Decision</h2>\n<p>In the district court, plaintiffs successfully argued that Cablevision's proposed system would directly infringe their copyrights in three ways. First, by briefly storing data in the primary ingest buffer and other data buffers integral to the function of the RS-DVR, Cablevision would make copies of protected works and thereby directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive right of reproduction under the Copyright Act. Second, by copying programs onto the Arroyo Server hard disks (the \"playback copies\"), Cablevision would again directly infringe the reproduction right. And third, by transmitting the data from the Arroyo Server hard disks to its RS-DVR customers in response to a \"playback\" request, Cablevision would directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive right of public performance. <i>See id.</i> at 617. Agreeing with all three arguments, the district court awarded summary declaratory judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from operating the RS-DVR system without obtaining licenses from the plaintiff copyright holders.</p>\n<p>As to the buffer data, the district court rejected defendants' arguments 1) that the data were not \"fixed\" and therefore were not \"copies\" as defined in the Copyright Act, and 2) that any buffer copying was de minimis because the buffers stored only small amounts of data for very short periods of time. In rejecting the latter argument, the district court noted that the \"aggregate effect of the buffering\" was to reproduce the entirety of Cablevision's programming, and such copying \"can hardly be called de minimis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 621.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> On the issue of whether creation of the playback copies made Cablevision liable for direct infringement, the parties and the district court agreed that the dispositive question was \"<i>who</i> makes the copies\"? <i>Id.</i> at 617. Emphasizing Cablevision's \"unfettered discretion\" over the content available for recording, its ownership and maintenance of the RS-DVR components, and its \"continuing relationship\" with its RS-DVR customers, the district court concluded that \"the copying of programming to the RS-DVR's Arroyo servers ... would be done not by the customer but by Cablevision, albeit at the customer's request.\" <i>Id.</i> at 618, 620, 621.</p>\n<p>Finally, as to the public performance right, Cablevision conceded that, during the playback, \"the streaming of recorded programming in response to a customer's request is a performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622. Cablevision contended, however, that the work was performed not by Cablevision, but by the customer, an argument the district court rejected \"for the same reasons that [it] reject[ed] the argument that the customer is `doing' the copying involved in the RS-DVR.\" <i>Id.</i> Cablevision also argued that such a playback transmission was not \"to the public,\" and therefore not a public performance as defined in the Copyright Act, because it \"emanates from a distinct copy of a program uniquely associated with one customer's set-top box and intended for that customer's exclusive viewing in his or her home.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court disagreed, noting that \"Cablevision would transmit <i>the same program</i> to members of the public, who may receive the performance at different times, depending on whether they view the program in real time or at a later time as an RS-DVR playback.\" <i>Id.</i> at 623 (emphasis added). The district court also relied on a case from the Northern District of California, <i>On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></span> (N.D.Cal.1991), which held that when the relationship between the transmitter and the audience of a performance is commercial, the transmission is \"to the public,\" <i>see </i><i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 623 (citing <i>On Command,</i> 777 F.Supp. at 790).</p>\n<p>Finding that the operation of the RS-DVR would infringe plaintiffs' copyrights, the district court awarded summary judgment to plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from copying or publicly performing plaintiffs' copyrighted works \"in connection with its proposed RS-DVR system,\" unless it obtained the necessary licenses. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 624. Cablevision appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794396\"><a href=\"/opinion/794396/bill-graham-archives-v-dorling-kindersley-limited-dorling-kindersley/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 607 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>\"Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants copyright holders a bundle of exclusive rights....\" <i>Id.</i> at 607-08. This case implicates two of those rights: the right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,\" and the right \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), (4). As discussed above, the district court found that Cablevision infringed the first right by 1) buffering the data from its programming stream and 2) copying content onto the Arroyo Server hard disks to enable playback of a program requested by an RS-DVR customer. In addition, the district court found that Cablevision would infringe the public performance right by transmitting a program to an RS-DVR customer in response to that customer's playback request. We address each of these three allegedly infringing acts in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> I. The Buffer Data</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that Cablevision, not any customer or other entity, takes the content from one stream of programming, after the split, and stores it, one small piece at a time, in the BMR buffer and the primary ingest buffer. As a result, the information is buffered before any customer requests a recording, and would be buffered even if no such request were made. The question is whether, by buffering the data that make up a given work, Cablevision \"reproduce[s]\" that work \"in copies,\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(1), and thereby infringes the copyright holder's reproduction right.</p>\n<p>\"Copies,\" as defined in the Copyright Act, \"are material objects ... in which a work is fixed by any method ... and from which the work can be ... reproduced.\" <i>Id.</i> § 101. The Act also provides that a work is \"`fixed' in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment ... is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be ... reproduced ... <i>for a period of more than transitory duration.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). We believe that this language plainly imposes two distinct but related requirements: the work must be embodied in a medium, i.e., placed in a medium such that it can be perceived, reproduced, etc., from that medium (the \"embodiment requirement\"), and it must remain thus embodied \"for a period of more than transitory duration\" (the \"duration requirement\"). <i>See</i> 2 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 8.02[B][3], at 8-32 (2007). Unless both requirements are met, the work is not \"fixed\" in the buffer, and, as a result, the buffer data is not a \"copy\" of the original work whose data is buffered.</p>\n<p>The district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement. As a result of this error, once it determined that the buffer data was \"[c]learly ... capable of being reproduced,\" i.e., that the work was embodied in the buffer, the district court concluded that the work was therefore \"fixed\" in the buffer, and that a copy had thus been made. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 621-22. In doing so, it relied on a line of cases beginning with <i>MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604904\"><a href=\"/opinion/604904/mai-systems-corp-v-peak-computer-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1993). It also relied on the United States Copyright Office's 2001 report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which states, in essence, that an embodiment is fixed \"[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so fleetingly that <i>it cannot be copied.</i>\" U.S. Copyright Office, <i>DMCA Section 104 Report</i> 111 (Aug.2001) (<i>\"DMCA Report\"</i>) (emphasis added), <i>available at</i> http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/sec-104-report-vol-1.pdf.</p>\n<p>The district court's reliance on cases like <i>MAI Systems</i> is misplaced. In general, those cases conclude that an alleged copy is fixed without addressing the duration requirement; it does not follow, however, that those cases assume, much less establish, that such a requirement does not exist. Indeed, the duration requirement, by itself, was not at issue in <i>MAI Systems</i> and its progeny. As a result, they do not speak to the issues squarely before us here: If a work is only \"embodied\" in a medium for a period of transitory duration, can it be \"fixed\" in that medium, and thus a copy? And what constitutes a period \"of more than transitory duration\"?</p>\n<p>In <i>MAI Systems,</i> defendant Peak Computer, Inc., performed maintenance and repairs on computers made and sold by MAI Systems. In order to service a customer's computer, a Peak employee had to operate the computer and run the computer's copyrighted operating system software. <i>See MAI Sys.,</i> 991 F.2d at 513. The issue in <i>MAI Systems</i> was whether, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> by loading the software into the computer's RAM,<sup>[1]</sup> the repairman created a \"copy\" as defined in § 101. <i>See id.</i> at 517. The resolution of this issue turned on whether the software's embodiment in the computer's RAM was \"fixed,\" within the meaning of the same section. The Ninth Circuit concluded that</p>\n<blockquote>by showing that Peak loads the software into the RAM and is then able to view the system error log and diagnose the problem with the computer, MAI has adequately shown that the representation created in the RAM is \"sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 518 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 101).</p>\n<p>The <i>MAI Systems</i> court referenced the \"transitory duration\" language but did not discuss or analyze it. The opinion notes that the defendants \"vigorously\" argued that the program's embodiment in the RAM was not a copy, but it does not specify the arguments defendants made. <i>Id.</i> at 517. This omission suggests that the parties did not litigate the significance of the \"transitory duration\" language, and the court therefore had no occasion to address it. This is unsurprising, because it seems fair to assume that in these cases the program was embodied in the RAM for at least several minutes.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we construe <i>MAI Systems</i> and its progeny as holding that loading a program into a computer's RAM <i>can</i> result in copying that program. We do not read <i>MAI Systems</i> as holding that, as a matter of law, loading a program into a form of RAM <i>always</i> results in copying. Such a holding would read the \"transitory duration\" language out of the definition, and we do not believe our sister circuit would dismiss this statutory language without even discussing it. It appears the parties in <i>MAI Systems</i> simply did not dispute that the duration requirement was satisfied; this line of cases simply concludes that when a program is loaded into RAM, the embodiment requirement is satisfiedan important holding in itself, and one we see no reason to quibble with here.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>At least one court, relying on <i>MAI Systems</i> in a highly similar factual setting, has made this point explicitly. In <i>Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc. v. MAI Systems Corp.,</i> the district court expressly noted that the unlicensed user in that case ran copyrighted diagnostic software \"for minutes or longer,\" but that the program's embodiment in the computer's RAM might be too ephemeral to be fixed if the computer had been shut down \"within <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> seconds or fractions of a second\" after loading the copyrighted program. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span>, 363 (E.D.Va.1994). We have no quarrel with this reasoning; it merely makes explicit the reasoning that is implicit in the other <i>MAI Systems</i> cases. Accordingly, those cases provide no support for the conclusion that the definition of \"fixed\" does not include a duration requirement. <i>See </i><i>Webster v. Fall,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></span>, 511, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></span> (1924) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\").</p>\n<p>Nor does the Copyright Office's 2001 DMCA Report, also relied on by the district court in this case, explicitly suggest that the definition of \"fixed\" does not contain a duration requirement. However, as noted above, it does suggest that an embodiment is fixed \"[u]nless a reproduction manifests itself so fleetingly that it cannot be copied, perceived or communicated.\" <i>DMCA Report, supra,</i> at 111. As we have stated, to determine whether a work is \"fixed\" in a given medium, the statutory language directs us to ask not only 1) whether a work is \"embodied\" in that medium, but also 2) whether it is embodied in the medium \"for a period of more than transitory duration.\" According to the Copyright Office, if the work is capable of being copied from that medium <i>for any amount of time,</i> the answer to both questions is \"yes.\" The problem with this interpretation is that it reads the \"transitory duration\" language out of the statute.</p>\n<p>We assume, as the parties do, that the Copyright Office's pronouncement deserves only <i>Skidmore</i> deference, deference based on its \"power to persuade.\" <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span> (1944). And because the Office's interpretation does not explain why Congress would include language in a definition if it intended courts to ignore that language, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>In sum, no case law or other authority dissuades us from concluding that the definition of \"fixed\" imposes both an embodiment requirement and a duration requirement. <i>Accord </i><i>CoStar Group Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786721\"><a href=\"/opinion/786721/costar-group-incorporated-costar-realty-information-incorporated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 551 (4th Cir. 2004) (while temporary reproductions \"may be made in this transmission process, they would appear not to be `fixed' in the sense that they are `of more than transitory duration'\"). We now turn to whether, in this case, those requirements are met by the buffer data.</p>\n<p>Cablevision does not seriously dispute that copyrighted works are \"embodied\" in the buffer. Data in the BMR buffer can be reformatted and transmitted to the other components of the RS-DVR system. Data in the primary ingest buffer can be copied onto the Arroyo hard disks if a user has requested a recording of that data. Thus, a work's \"embodiment\" in either buffer \"is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced,\" (as in the case of the ingest buffer) \"or otherwise communicated\" (as in the BMR buffer). 17 U.S.C. § 101. The result might be different if only a single second of a much longer work was placed in the buffer in isolation. In such a situation, it might be reasonable to conclude that only a minuscule portion of a work, rather than \"a work\" was embodied in the buffer. Here, however, where every second of an entire work is placed, one second at a time, in the buffer, we conclude that the work is embodied in the buffer.</p>\n<p>Does any such embodiment last \"for a period of more than transitory duration\"? <i>Id.</i> No bit of data remains in any buffer for more than a fleeting 1.2 seconds. And unlike the data in cases like <i>MAI</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> <i>Systems,</i> which remained embodied in the computer's RAM memory until the user turned the computer off, each bit of data here is rapidly and automatically overwritten as soon as it is processed. While our inquiry is necessarily fact-specific, and other factors not present here may alter the duration analysis significantly, these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a \"transitory\" period, thus failing the duration requirement.</p>\n<p>Against this evidence, plaintiffs argue only that the duration is not transitory because the data persist \"long enough for Cablevision to make reproductions from them.\" Br. of Pls.-Appellees the Cartoon Network et al. at 51. As we have explained above, however, this reasoning impermissibly reads the duration language out of the statute, and we reject it. Given that the data reside in no buffer for more than 1.2 seconds before being automatically overwritten, and in the absence of compelling arguments to the contrary, we believe that the copyrighted works here are not \"embodied\" in the buffers for a period of more than transitory duration, and are therefore not \"fixed\" in the buffers. Accordingly, the acts of buffering in the operation of the RS-DVR do not create copies, as the Copyright Act defines that term. Our resolution of this issue renders it unnecessary for us to determine whether any copies produced by buffering data would be de minimis, and we express no opinion on that question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Direct Liability for Creating the Playback Copies</h2>\n<p>In most copyright disputes, the allegedly infringing act and the identity of the infringer are never in doubt. These cases turn on whether the conduct in question does, in fact, infringe the plaintiff's copyright. In this case, however, the core of the dispute is over the authorship of the infringing conduct. After an RS-DVR subscriber selects a program to record, and that program airs, a copy of the programa copyrighted workresides on the hard disks of Cablevision's Arroyo Server, its creation unauthorized by the copyright holder. The question is <i>who</i> made this copy. If it is Cablevision, plaintiffs' theory of direct infringement succeeds; if it is the customer, plaintiffs' theory fails because Cablevision would then face, at most, secondary liability, a theory of liability expressly disavowed by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Few cases examine the line between direct and contributory liability. Both parties cite a line of cases beginning with <i>Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1361</span></span> (N.D.Cal.1995). In <i>Netcom,</i> a third-party customer of the defendant Internet service provider (\"ISP\") posted a copyrighted work that was automatically reproduced by the defendant's computer. The district court refused to impose direct liability on the ISP, reasoning that \"[a]lthough copyright is a strict liability statute, there should still be some element of volition or causation which is lacking where a defendant's system is merely used to create a copy by a third party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1370. Recently, the Fourth Circuit endorsed the <i>Netcom</i> decision, noting that</p>\n<blockquote>to establish <i>direct</i> liability under ... the Act, something more must be shown than mere ownership of a machine used by others to make illegal copies. There must be actual infringing conduct with a nexus sufficiently close and causal to the illegal copying that one could conclude that the machine owner himself trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright owner.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786721\"><a href=\"/opinion/786721/costar-group-incorporated-costar-realty-information-incorporated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 550 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> Here, the district court pigeon-holed the conclusions reached in <i>Netcom</i> and its progeny as \"premised on the unique attributes of the Internet.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. While the <i>Netcom</i> court was plainly concerned with a theory of direct liability that would effectively \"hold the entire Internet liable\" for the conduct of a single user, 907 F.Supp. at 1372, its reasoning and conclusions, consistent with precedents of this court and the Supreme Court, and with the text of the Copyright Act, transcend the Internet. Like the Fourth Circuit, we reject the contention that \"the <i>Netcom</i> decision was driven by expedience and that its holding is inconsistent with the established law of copyright,\" <i>CoStar,</i> 373 F.3d at 549, and we find it \"a particularly rational interpretation of § 106,\" <i>id.</i> at 551, rather than a special-purpose rule applicable only to ISPs.</p>\n<p>When there is a dispute as to the author of an allegedly infringing instance of reproduction, <i>Netcom</i> and its progeny direct our attention to the volitional conduct that causes the copy to be made. There are only two instances of volitional conduct in this case: Cablevision's conduct in designing, housing, and maintaining a system that exists only to produce a copy, and a customer's conduct in ordering that system to produce a copy of a specific program. In the case of a VCR, it seems clear  and we know of no case holding otherwise  that the operator of the VCR, the person who actually presses the button to make the recording, supplies the necessary element of volition, not the person who manufactures, maintains, or, if distinct from the operator, owns the machine. We do not believe that an RS-DVR customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a VCR user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customer's command.</p>\n<p>The district court emphasized the fact that copying is \"instrumental\" rather than \"incidental\" to the function of the RS-DVR system. <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. While that may distinguish the RS-DVR from the ISPs in <i>Netcom</i> and <i>CoStar,</i> it does not distinguish the RS-DVR from a VCR, a photocopier, or even a typical copy shop. And the parties do not seem to contest that a company that merely makes photocopiers available to the public on its premises, without more, is not subject to liability for direct infringement for reproductions made by customers using those copiers. They only dispute whether Cablevision is similarly situated to such a proprietor.</p>\n<p>The district court found Cablevision analogous to a copy shop that makes course packs for college professors. In the leading case involving such a shop, for example, \"[t]he professor [gave] the copyshop the materials of which the coursepack [was] to be made up, and the copyshop [did] the rest.\" <i>Princeton Univ. Press v. Mich. Document Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729643\"><a href=\"/opinion/729643/princeton-university-press-macmillan-inc-and-st-martins-press-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1384 (6th Cir.1996) (en banc). There did not appear to be any serious dispute in that case that the shop itself was directly liable for reproducing copyrighted works. The district court here found that Cablevision, like this copy shop, would be \"doing\" the copying, albeit \"at the customer's behest.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620.</p>\n<p>But because volitional conduct is an important element of direct liability, the district court's analogy is flawed. In determining who actually \"makes\" a copy, a significant difference exists between making a request to a human employee, who then volitionally operates the copying system to make the copy, and issuing a command directly to a system, which automatically obeys commands and engages in no volitional conduct. In cases like <i>Princeton</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> <i>University Press,</i> the defendants operated a copying device and sold the product they made using that device. <i>See</i> 99 F.3d at 1383 (\"The corporate defendant ... is a commercial copyshop that reproduced substantial segments of copyrighted works of scholarship, bound the copies into `coursepacks,' and sold the coursepacks to students....\"). Here, by selling access to a system that automatically produces copies on command, Cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises, and it seems incorrect to say, without more, that such a proprietor \"makes\" any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers. <i>See </i><i>Netcom,</i> 907 F.Supp. at 1369. Some courts have held to the contrary, but they do not explicitly explain why, and we find them unpersuasive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elektra Records Co. v. Gem Elec. Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1887850\"><a href=\"/opinion/1887850/elektra-records-co-v-gem-electronic-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 823 (E.D.N.Y.1973) (concluding that, \"regardless\" of whether customers or defendants' employees operated the tape-copying machines at defendants' stores, defendant had actively infringed copyrights).</p>\n<p>The district court also emphasized Cablevision's \"unfettered discretion in selecting the programming that it would make available for recording.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 620. This conduct is indeed more proximate to the creation of illegal copying than, say, operating an ISP or opening a copy shop, where all copied content was supplied by the customers themselves or other third parties. Nonetheless, we do not think it sufficiently proximate to the copying to displace the customer as the person who \"makes\" the copies when determining liability under the Copyright Act. Cablevision, we note, also has subscribers who use home VCRs or DVRs (like TiVo), and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers. But this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves. Cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air, if at all. In this respect, Cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the VOD context, where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing. For these reasons, we are not inclined to say that Cablevision, rather than the user, \"does\" the copying produced by the RS-DVR system. As a result, we find that the district court erred in concluding that Cablevision, rather than its RS-DVR customers, makes the copies carried out by the RS-DVR system.</p>\n<p>Our refusal to find Cablevision directly liable on these facts is buttressed by the existence and contours of the Supreme Court's doctrine of contributory liability in the copyright context. After all, the purpose of any causation-based liability doctrine is to identify the actor (or actors) whose \"conduct has been so significant and important a cause that [he or she] should be legally responsible.\" W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on Torts</i> § 42, at 273 (5th ed.1984). But here, to the extent that we may construe the boundaries of direct liability more narrowly, the doctrine of contributory liability stands ready to provide adequate protection to copyrighted works.</p>\n<p>Most of the facts found dispositive by the district courte.g., Cablevision's \"continuing relationship\" with its RS-DVR customers, its control over recordable content, and the \"instrumental[ity]\" of copying to the RS-DVR system, <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 618-20seem to us more relevant to the question of contributory liability. In <i>Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,</i> the lack of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> \"ongoing relationship\" between Sony and its VCR customers supported the Court's conclusion that it should not impose <i>contributory</i> liability on Sony for any infringing copying done by Sony VCR owners. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 437-38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span> (1984). The <i>Sony</i> Court did deem it \"just\" to impose liability on a party in a \"position to control\" the infringing uses of another, but as a contributory, not direct, infringer. <i>Id.</i> at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>. And asking whether copying copyrighted material is only \"incidental\" to a given technology is akin to asking whether that technology has \"commercially significant noninfringing uses,\" another inquiry the <i>Sony</i> Court found relevant to whether imposing <i>contributory</i> liability was just. <i>Id.</i> at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's desire to maintain a meaningful distinction between direct and contributory copyright infringement is consistent with congressional intent. The Patent Act, unlike the Copyright Act, expressly provides that someone who \"actively induces infringement of a patent\" is \"liable as an infringer,\" 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), just like someone who commits the underlying infringing act by \"us[ing]\" a patented invention without authorization, <i>id.</i> § 271(a). In contrast, someone who merely \"sells ... a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process\" faces only liability as a \"contributory infringer.\" <i>Id.</i> § 271(c). If Congress had meant to assign direct liability to both the person who actually commits a copyright-infringing act and any person who actively induces that infringement, the Patent Act tells us that it knew how to draft a statute that would have this effect. Because Congress did not do so, the <i>Sony</i> Court concluded that \"[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another.\" 464 U.S. at 434, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>. Furthermore, in cases like <i>Sony,</i> the Supreme Court has strongly signaled its intent to use the doctrine of contributory infringement, not direct infringement, to \"identify[] the circumstances in which it is just to hold one individual accountable for the actions of another.\" <i>Id.</i> at 435, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>. Thus, although <i>Sony</i> warns us that \"the lines between direct infringement, contributory infringement, and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn,\" <i>id.</i> at 435 n. 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), that decision does not absolve us of our duty to discern where that line falls in cases, like this one, that require us to decide the question.</p>\n<p>The district court apparently concluded that Cablevision's operation of the RS-DVR system would contribute in such a major way to the copying done by another that it made sense to say that Cablevision was a direct infringer, and thus, in effect, was \"doing\" the relevant copying. There are certainly other cases, not binding on us, that follow this approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Playboy Enters. v. Russ Hardenburgh, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528091/playboy-enterprises-inc-v-russ-hardenburgh-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 513 (N.D.Ohio 1997) (noting that defendant ISP's encouragement of its users to copy protected files was \"crucial\" to finding that it was a direct infringer). We need not decide today whether one's contribution to the creation of an infringing copy may be so great that it warrants holding that party directly liable for the infringement, even though another party has actually made the copy. We conclude only that on the facts of this case, copies produced by the RS-DVR system are \"made\" by the RS-DVR customer, and Cablevision's contribution to this reproduction by providing the system does not warrant the imposition of direct liability. Therefore, Cablevision is entitled to summary judgment on this point, and the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> III. Transmission of RS-DVR Playback</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' final theory is that Cablevision will violate the Copyright Act by engaging in unauthorized public performances of their works through the playback of the RS-DVR copies. The Act grants a copyright owner the exclusive right, \"in the case of ... motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(4). Section 101, the definitional section of the Act, explains that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o perform or display a work \"publicly\" means (1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or (2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 101.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that this case does not implicate clause (1). Accordingly, we ask whether these facts satisfy the second, \"transmit clause\" of the public performance definition: Does Cablevision \"transmit... a performance ... of the work ... to the public\"? <i>Id.</i> No one disputes that the RS-DVR playback results in the transmission of a performance of a workthe transmission from the Arroyo Server to the customer's television set. Cablevision contends that (1) the RS-DVR customer, rather than Cablevision, does the transmitting and thus the performing and (2) the transmission is not \"to the public\" under the transmit clause.</p>\n<p>As to Cablevision's first argument, we note that our conclusion in Part II that the customer, not Cablevision, \"does\" the copying does not dictate a parallel conclusion that the customer, and not Cablevision, \"performs\" the copyrighted work. The definitions that delineate the contours of the reproduction and public performance rights vary in significant ways. For example, the statute defines the verb \"perform\" and the noun \"copies,\" but not the verbs \"reproduce\" or \"copy.\" <i>Id.</i> We need not address Cablevision's first argument further because, even if we assume that Cablevision makes the transmission when an RS-DVR playback occurs, we find that the RS-DVR playback, as described here, does not involve the transmission of a performance \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>The statute itself does not expressly define the term \"performance\" or the phrase \"to the public.\" It does explain that a transmission may be \"to the public ... whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\" <i>Id.</i> This plain language instructs us that, in determining whether a transmission is \"to the public,\" it is of no moment that the potential recipients of the transmission are in different places, or that they may receive the transmission at different times. The implication from this same language, however, is that it is relevant, in determining whether a transmission is made to the public, to discern who is \"capable of receiving\" the performance being transmitted. The fact that the statute says \"capable of receiving the performance,\" instead of \"capable of receiving the transmission,\" underscores the fact that a transmission of a performance is itself a performance. <i>Cf. </i><i>Buck v. Jewell-La Salle Realty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101717\"><a href=\"/opinion/101717/buck-v-jewell-lasalle-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 197-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101717\"><a href=\"/opinion/101717/buck-v-jewell-lasalle-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span> (1931).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> The legislative history of the transmit clause supports this interpretation. The House Report on the 1976 Copyright Act states that</p>\n<blockquote>[u]nder the bill, as under the present law, a performance made available <i>by transmission to the public at large</i> is \"public\" even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the <i>potential recipients</i> was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply whenever the <i>potential recipients of the transmission</i> represent a limited segment of the public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television service.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64-65 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5678 (emphases added).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also reference a 1967 House Report, issued nearly a decade before the Act we are interpreting, stating that the same principles apply where the transmission is \"<i>capable of reaching</i> different recipients at different times, as in the case of sounds or images stored in an information system and <i>capable of being performed or displayed</i> at the initiative of individual members of the public.\" H.R.Rep. No. 90-83, at 29 (1967) (emphases added). We question how much deference this report deserves. But we need not belabor the point here, as the 1967 report is consistent with both legislative history contemporaneous with the Act's passage and our own interpretation of the statute's plain meaning.</p>\n<p>From the foregoing, it is evident that the transmit clause directs us to examine who precisely is \"capable of receiving\" a particular transmission of a performance. Cablevision argues that, because each RS-DVR transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work, made by an individual subscriber, one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscriber's cable box, only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given RS-DVR transmission. This argument accords with the language of the transmit clause, which, as described above, directs us to consider the potential audience of a given transmission. We are unpersuaded by the district court's reasoning and the plaintiffs' arguments that we should consider a larger potential audience in determining whether a transmission is \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>The district court, in deciding whether the RS-DVR playback of a program to a particular customer is \"to the public,\" apparently considered all of Cablevision's customers who subscribe to the channel airing that program and all of Cablevision's RS-DVR subscribers who request a copy of that program. Thus, it concluded that the RS-DVR playbacks constituted public performances because \"Cablevision would transmit the <i>same program</i> to members of the public, who may receive the performance at different times, depending on whether they view the program in real time or at a later time as an RS-DVR playback.\" <i>Cablevision I,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 623 (emphasis added). In essence, the district court suggested that, in considering whether a transmission is \"to the public,\" we consider not the potential audience of a particular transmission, but the potential audience of the underlying work (i.e., \"the program\") whose content is being transmitted.</p>\n<p>We cannot reconcile the district court's approach with the language of the transmit clause. That clause speaks of people capable of receiving a particular \"transmission\" or \"performance,\" and not of the potential audience of a particular \"work.\" Indeed, such an approach would render the \"to the public\" language surplusage. Doubtless the <i>potential</i> audience for every <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> copyrighted audiovisual work is the general public. As a result, any transmission of the content of a copyrighted work would constitute a public performance under the district court's interpretation. But the transmit clause obviously contemplates the existence of non-public transmissions; if it did not, Congress would have stopped drafting that clause after \"performance.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, plaintiffs offer a slight variation of this interpretation. They argue that both in its real-time cablecast and via the RS-DVR playback, Cablevision is in fact transmitting the \"same performance\" of a given work: the performance of the work that occurs when the programming service supplying Cablevision's content transmits that content to Cablevision and the service's other licensees. <i>See</i> Br. of Pls.-Appellees Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. et al. at 27 (\"Fox Br.\") (\"The critical factor ... is that the same <i>performance</i> is transmitted to different subscribers at different times .... more specifically, the <i>performance</i> of that program <i>by HBO or another programming service.</i>\" (third emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Thus, according to plaintiffs, when Congress says that to perform a work publicly means to transmit ... a performance ... to the public, they really meant \"transmit... the `original performance' ... to the public.\" The implication of this theory is that to determine whether a given transmission of a performance is \"to the public,\" we would consider not only the potential audience of that transmission, but also the potential audience of any transmission of the same underlying \"original\" performance.</p>\n<p>Like the district court's interpretation, this view obviates any possibility of a purely private transmission. Furthermore, it makes Cablevision's liability depend, in part, on the actions of legal strangers. Assume that HBO transmits a copyrighted work to both Cablevision and Comcast. Cablevision merely retransmits the work from one Cablevision facility to another, while Comcast retransmits the program to its subscribers. Under plaintiffs' interpretation, Cablevision would still be transmitting the performance to the public, solely because Comcast has transmitted the same underlying performance to the public. Similarly, a hapless customer who records a program in his den and later transmits the recording to a television in his bedroom would be liable for publicly performing the work simply because some other party had once transmitted the same underlying performance to the public.</p>\n<p>We do not believe Congress intended such odd results. Although the transmit clause is not a model of clarity, we believe that when Congress speaks of transmitting a performance to the public, it refers to the performance created by the act of transmission. Thus, HBO transmits its own performance of a work when it transmits to Cablevision, and Cablevision transmits its own performance of the same work when it retransmits the feed from HBO.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we believe it would be inconsistent with our own transmit clause jurisprudence to consider the potential audience of an upstream transmission by a third party when determining whether a defendant's own subsequent transmission of a performance is \"to the public.\" In <i>National Football League v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture</i> (NFL), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768551\"><a href=\"/opinion/768551/national-football-league-v-primetime-24-joint-venture/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span> (2000), we examined the transmit clause in the context of satellite television provider PrimeTime, which captured protected content in the United States from the NFL, transmitted it from the United States to a satellite (\"the uplink\"), and then transmitted it from the satellite to subscribers in both the United States and Canada (\"the downlink\"). PrimeTime had a license to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> transmit to its U.S. customers, but not its Canadian customers. It argued that although the downlink transmission to its Canadian subscribers was a public performance, it could not be held liable for that act because it occurred entirely outside of the United States and therefore was not subject to the strictures of the Copyright Act. It also argued that the uplink transmission was not a public performance because it was a transmission to a single satellite. <i>See id.</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>The <i>NFL</i> court did not question the first assumption, but it flatly rejected the second on a specific and germane ground:</p>\n<blockquote>We believe the most logical interpretation of the Copyright Act is to hold that a public performance or display includes each step in the process by which a protected work wends its way to its audience. Under that analysis, it is clear that PrimeTime's uplink transmission of signals captured in the United States is a step in the process by which NFL's protected work wends its way <i>to a public audience.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 13 (emphasis added) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Thus, while the uplink transmission that took place in the United States was not, in itself, \"to the public,\" the <i>NFL</i> court deemed it so because it ultimately resulted in an undisputed public performance. Notably, the <i>NFL</i> court did not base its decision on the fact that an upstream transmission by another party (the NFL) might have been to the public. Nor did the court base its decision on the fact that Primetime simultaneously transmitted a performance of the work to the public in the United States. Because <i>NFL</i> directs us to look downstream, rather than upstream or laterally, to determine whether any link in a chain of transmissions made by a party constitutes a public performance, we reject plaintiffs' contention that we examine the potential recipients of the content provider's initial transmission to determine who is capable of receiving the RS-DVR playback transmission.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also rely on <i>NFL</i> for the proposition that Cablevision publicly performs a work when it splits its programming stream and transmits the second stream to the RS-DVR system. Because <i>NFL</i> only supports that conclusion if we determine that the final transmission in the chain (i.e., the RS-DVR playback transmission) is \"to the public,\" plaintiffs' reliance on <i>NFL</i> is misplaced. <i>NFL</i> dealt with a chain of transmissions whose final link was undisputedly a public performance. It therefore does not guide our current inquiry.</p>\n<p>In sum, none of the arguments advanced by plaintiffs or the district court alters our conclusion that, under the transmit clause, we must examine the potential audience of a given transmission by an alleged infringer to determine whether that transmission is \"to the public.\" And because the RS-DVR system, as designed, only makes transmissions to one subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber, we believe that the universe of people capable of receiving an RS-DVR transmission is the single subscriber whose self-made copy is used to create that transmission.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs contend that it is \"wholly irrelevant, in determining the existence of a public performance, whether `unique' <i>copies</i> of the same work are used to make the transmissions.\" Fox Br. at 27. But plaintiffs cite no authority for this contention. And our analysis of the transmit clause suggests that, in general, any factor that limits the <i>potential</i> audience of a transmission is relevant.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, no transmission of an audiovisual work can be made, we assume, without using a copy of that work: to transmit a performance of a movie, for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> example, the transmitter generally must obtain a copy of that movie. As a result, in the context of movies, television programs, and other audiovisual works, the right of reproduction can reinforce and protect the right of public performance. If the owner of a copyright believes he is injured by a particular transmission of a performance of his work, he may be able to seek redress not only for the infringing transmission, but also for the underlying copying that facilitated the transmission. Given this interplay between the various rights in this context, it seems quite consistent with the Act to treat a transmission made using Copy A as distinct from one made using Copy B, just as we would treat a transmission made by Cablevision as distinct from an otherwise identical transmission made by Comcast. Both factorsthe identity of the transmitter and the source material of the transmissionlimit the potential audience of a transmission in this case and are therefore germane in determining whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, we believe that <i>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445042\"><a href=\"/opinion/445042/columbia-pictures-industries-inc-v-redd-horne-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1984), relied on by both plaintiffs and the district court, supports our decision to accord significance to the existence and use of distinct copies in our transmit clause analysis. In that case, defendant operated a video rental store, Maxwell's, which also housed a number of small private booths containing seats and a television. Patrons would select a film, enter the booth, and close the door. An employee would then load a copy of the requested movie into a bank of VCRs at the front of the store and push play, thereby transmitting the content of the tape to the television in the viewing booth. <i>See id.</i> at 156-57.</p>\n<p>The Third Circuit found that defendants' conduct constituted a public performance under both clauses of the statutory definition. In concluding that Maxwell's violated the transmit clause, that court explicitly relied on the fact that defendants showed the same copy of a work seriatim to its clientele, and it quoted a treatise emphasizing the same fact:</p>\n<blockquote>Professor Nimmer's examination of this definition is particularly pertinent: \"<i>if the same copy</i> ... of a given work is repeatedly played (<i>i.e.,</i> `performed') by different members of the public, albeit at different times, this constitutes a `public' performance.\" 2 M. Nimmer, § 8.14[C][3], at 8-142 (emphasis in original).... Although Maxwell's has only one copy of each film, it shows each copy repeatedly to different members of the public. This constitutes a public performance.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 159 (first omission in original).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither the <i>Redd Horne</i> court nor Prof. Nimmer explicitly explains <i>why</i> the use of a distinct copy affects the transmit clause inquiry. But our independent analysis confirms the soundness of their intuition: the use of a unique copy may limit the potential audience of a transmission and is therefore relevant to whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\" Plaintiffs' unsupported arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p>Given that each RS-DVR transmission is made to a given subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber, we conclude that such a transmission is not \"to the public,\" without analyzing the contours of that phrase in great detail. No authority cited by the parties or the district court persuades us to the contrary.</p>\n<p>In addition to <i>Redd Horne,</i> the district court also cited and analyzed <i>On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></span> (N.D.Cal. 1991), in its transmit clause analysis. In that case, defendant On Command developed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> and sold \"a system for the electronic delivery of movie video tapes,\" which it sold to hotels. <i>Id.</i> at 788. The hub of the system was a bank of video cassette players, each containing a copy of a particular movie. From his room, a hotel guest could select a movie via remote control from a list on his television. The corresponding cassette player would start, and its output would be transmitted to that guest's room. During this playback, the movie selected was unavailable to other guests. <i>See id.</i> The court concluded that the transmissions made by this system were made to the public \"because the relationship between the transmitter of the performance, On Command, and the audience, hotel guests, is a commercial, `public' one regardless of where the viewing takes place.\" <i>Id.</i> at 790.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to the <i>On Command</i> court, any commercial transmission is a transmission \"to the public.\" We find this interpretation untenable, as it completely rewrites the language of the statutory definition. If Congress had wished to make all commercial transmissions public performances, the transmit clause would read: \"to perform a work publicly means ... to transmit a performance for commercial purposes.\" In addition, this interpretation overlooks, as Congress did not, the possibility that even non-commercial transmissions to the public may diminish the value of a copyright. Finally, like <i>Redd Horne, On Command</i> is factually distinguishable, as successive transmissions to different viewers in that case could be made using a single copy of a given work. Thus, at the moment of transmission, any of the hotel's guests was capable of receiving a transmission made using a single copy of a given movie. As a result, the district court in this case erred in relying on <i>On Command.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also rely on <i>Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Products, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558968\"><a href=\"/opinion/558968/ford-motor-company-and-cross-appellee-v-summit-motor-products-inc-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1991), in which the Third Circuit interpreted § 106(3) of the Copyright Act, which gives the copyright holder the exclusive right \"to distribute copies ... of the copyrighted work <i>to the public,</i>\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) (emphasis added). The court concluded that \"even one person can be the public <i>for the purposes of section 106(3).</i>\" <i>Ford,</i> 930 F.2d at 299 (emphasis added). Commentators have criticized the <i>Ford</i> court for divesting the phrase \"to the public\" of \"all meaning whatsoever,\" 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 8.11[A], at 8-149, and the decision does appear to have that result. Whether this result was justified in the context of the distribution right is not for us to decide in this case. We merely note that we find no compelling reason, in the context of the transmit clause and the public performance right, to interpret the phrase \"to the public\" out of existence.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find that the transmit clause directs us to identify the potential audience of a given transmission, i.e., the persons \"capable of receiving\" it, to determine whether that transmission is made \"to the public.\" Because each RS-DVR playback transmission is made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber, we conclude that such transmissions are not performances \"to the public,\" and therefore do not infringe any exclusive right of public performance. We base this decision on the application of undisputed facts; thus, Cablevision is entitled to summary judgment on this point.</p>\n<p>This holding, we must emphasize, does not generally permit content delivery networks to avoid all copyright liability by making copies of each item of content and associating one unique copy with each subscriber to the network, or by giving their subscribers the capacity to make their own individual copies. We do not address whether such a network operator would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> able to escape any other form of copyright liability, such as liability for unauthorized reproductions or liability for contributory infringement.</p>\n<p>In sum, because we find, on undisputed facts, that Cablevision's proposed RS-DVR system would not directly infringe plaintiffs' exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works, we grant summary judgment in favor of Cablevision with respect to both rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's award of summary judgment to the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the district court's injunction against Cablevision is VACATED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To run a computer program, the data representing that program must be transferred from a data storage medium (such as a floppy disk or a hard drive) to a form of Random Access Memory (\"RAM\") where the data can be processed. The data buffers at issue here are also a form of RAM.</p>\n<p>[2]  The same reasoning also distinguishes this court's opinion in <i>Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publishing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758669\"><a href=\"/opinion/758669/matthew-bender-company-inc-hyperlaw-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 1998). Language in that opinion, taken out of context, suggests that the definition of \"fixed\" imposes only an embodiment requirement: \"Under § 101's definition of `copies,' a work satisfies the fixation requirement when it is fixed in a material object from which it can be perceived or communicated directly or with the aid of a machine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702. Like the <i>MAI Systems</i> cases, <i>Matthew Bender</i> only addresses the embodiment requirement: specifically, whether West's copyrighted arrangement of judicial opinions was \"embedded\" in a CD-ROM compilation of opinions when the cases were normally arranged differently but could be manipulated by the user to replicate West's copyrighted arrangement. <i>Id.</i> at 703. The opinion merely quotes the duration language without discussing it, <i>see id.</i> at 702; that case therefore does not compel us to conclude that the definition of \"fixed\" does not impose a duration requirement.</p>\n\n</div>",
