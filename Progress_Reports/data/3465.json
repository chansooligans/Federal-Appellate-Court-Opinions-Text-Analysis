Lesch, pro se, Petersburg, VA\n\n    FOR RESPONDENTS-APPELLEES:                   Paula Ryan Conan, Assistant United States\n                                                 Attorney, for Andrew T. Baxter, United States\n                                                 Attorney for the Northern District of New York,\n                                                 Syracuse, NY; Wayne L. Benjamin, New York\n                                                 State Office of the Attorney General, Albany, NY\n\fAppeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (McAvoy,\nJ.).\n      UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\n\nDECREED that the post-judgment order of the District Court be and hereby is AFFIRMED.\n\n       Appellant Anthony R. Lesch appeals the district court’s denial of his motion for\n\nreconsideration of its decision dismissing his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nWe assume the parties’ familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of\n\nappellate issues and hold as follows.\n\n       The standard of review of a district court order granting or denying a motion for relief\n\nfrom a final judgment is whether the order constituted an abuse of discretion. See Devlin v.\n\nTransp. Commc’ns Int’l Union, 175 F.3d 121, 132 (2d Cir. 1999) (noting the same abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion review for Rules 59(e) and 60(b)). “A district court would necessarily abuse its\n\ndiscretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous\n\nassessment of the evidence.” Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, 162 F.3d 724, 729\n\n(2d Cir. 1998). A motion for relief from a judgment is generally not favored and is granted only\n\nupon a showing of exceptional circumstances. Pichardo v. Aschcroft, 374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir.\n\n2004) (citing United States v. Intl. Bhd. of Teamsters, 247 F.3d 370, 391 (2d Cir. 2001)).\n\n“[R]econsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling\n\ndecisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in other words, that might reasonably be\n\nexpected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.” Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d\n\n255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995). Thus, a motion to reconsider should not be granted where the moving\n\nparty is solely attempting to relitigate an issue that already has been decided. Id. Here, the\n\ndistrict court properly found that Lesch sought only to re-argue his previously submitted claims.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fThus, the reconsideration motion was correctly denied, and Lesch’s appeal is without merit. See\n\nid.; Transaero, 162 F.3d at 729.\n\n       To the extent Lesch can challenge the district court’s failure to allow him to replead upon\n\nits sua sponte dismissal, see Digitel, Inc. v. MCI Worldcom, Inc., 239 F.3d 187, 189 n.2 (2d Cir.\n\n2001), such a claim is unavailing. A district court need not grant a pro se plaintiff leave to\n\namend if it can rule out any possibility, however unlikely it might be, that an amended complaint\n\nwould succeed. See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000); Gomez v. USAA Fed.\n\nSav. Bank, 171 F.3d 794, 795-96 (2d Cir. 1999). Although the district court did not expressly\n\nconsider the propriety of allowing Lesch leave to amend, an amendment would have been futile,\n\nas Lesch sought compensation for property that was forfeited pursuant to a judgment to which he\n\nconsented in connection with his conviction for production of child pornography in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2251. Thus, Lesch has no non-frivolous challenge to the district court’s dismissal of\n\nhis complaint. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n\nhereby AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                      FOR THE COURT:\n                                                      Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f",
