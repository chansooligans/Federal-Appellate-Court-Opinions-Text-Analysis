They now  challenge their convictions and sentences  on a\n\nwide variety  of grounds.   For the reasons  set forth  below, we\n\naffirm  all  of  the  convictions  except   for  the  bank  fraud\n\nconvictions on Counts 24  and 25 against defendant John  Ward and\n\nthe  bank  fraud convictions  on  Counts  23 through  26  against\n\ndefendant Owen Landman, which we reverse.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          This  case involves  an alleged  scheme to  obtain loan\n\nfinancing   from  a   federally  insured  bank   by  fraudulently\n\nrepresenting the existence of down payments required  by the bank\n\nfrom  the   investors  on  whose  behalf  the  loans  were  made.\n\nAccording to  the record in this  case, viewed in the  light most\n\nfavorable to  the government,  United States v.  Van Helden,  920\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 99,  101 (1st Cir.  1990), the facts  of this scheme  are as\n\nfollows.\n\n          On  January 1,  1985, defendant  Peter Brandon  and two\n\nothers formed a partnership called Dean Street Development (\"Dean\n\nStreet\")1  for the  purpose  of buying,  developing, and  selling\n\nreal estate.  Specifically, Brandon  planned to buy and  renovate\n\n                    \n\n1  Several partnerships  and corporations related to  Dean Street\nwere  also involved in this case.  Together they are collectively\nreferred to here as \"Dean Street.\"  Brandon controlled all of the\nvarious entities.\n\n                               -5-\n\nmotels  along  the  Rhode  Island  seashore,  convert  them  into\n\ncondominiums and then  sell the individual rooms  to investors as\n\ncondominium  units.  As part of this plan, the condominium buyers\n\nwould lease the units  back to Dean Street and  Dean Street would\n\nthen  manage the properties  as motels.   Under  the \"lease-back\"\n\nagreement  with the  buyers, Dean  Street would apply  the income\n\nfrom the operation of  the motels to cover the  monthly mortgage,\n\ntax  and  insurance  costs incurred  by  the  unit  buyers.   Any\n\nshortfalls  in operating costs would  be made up  by Dean Street,\n\nleaving the buyers with no monthly costs on their investment.\n\n          In addition, buyers would be allowed to use their units\n\nfor two weeks  out of the year.  Dean  Street would also guaranty\n\nthem  a  certain level  of profit  at  sale.   Some  buyers would\n\nreceive  rebates for  each unit  they purchased.   In  short, the\n\nbuyers would be offered a sweet deal.\n\n          To  make  the deal  even  sweeter,  Brandon planned  to\n\narrange all  the financing for  the buyers.   He hoped  to obtain\n\n100% financing, that is, loans for the complete purchase price of\n\neach  unit.   With  such financing,  buyers  could invest  in the\n\nproject without  putting any  money down and  consequently obtain\n\nthat elusive  -- yet apparently  not uncommon for  the fast-paced\n\nworld of 1980s real estate -- deal of \"something for nothing.\" \n\n          In  early 1987, Brandon  approached Homeowner's Funding\n\nCorporation  (\"Homeowners\"), a  mortgage broker  that acts  as an\n\nintermediary between  banks and  borrowers, to obtain  these \"end\n\nloans\" for the  buyers.  Homeowners' President told  Brandon that\n\n                               -6-\n\n100% financing was unavailable for the project.  Rather, the best\n\nBrandon could  hope to  find was  80% financing  with a 20%  down\n\npayment  required  from  the  buyers.    Homeowners  subsequently\n\nsearched  for  a lender  and,  after  approaching several  banks,\n\nlocated  Bay Loan and  Investment Bank (\"Bay  Loan\"), a financial\n\ninstitution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nBay Loan agreed to lend buyers of Dean Street's condominium units\n\nup to 80% of the required purchase price.\n\n          Homeowners, as well  as East-West Financial Corporation\n\n(\"East West\"), the other mortgage broker involved in this  case,2\n\nacted as brokers and servicing agents for Bay Loan.  Bay Loan was\n\nthe actual lender  for the  Dean Street project  and it  financed\n\nevery  condominium  sale  involved  in  the  scheme.    By  prior\n\nagreement,  Homeowners   and  East  West  provided  the  original\n\nmortgages  for the  buyers  and  then  sold  them  to  Bay  Loan.\n\nHomeowners and East West would forward  all the loan applications\n\nto Bay Loan for approval prior to providing the mortgages for the\n\ncondominium  units.3     The  decision  of  whether   to  fund  a\n\nparticular mortgage rested  entirely with Bay  Loan and Bay  Loan\n\n                    \n\n2   Toward the end of 1987, Brandon became dissatisfied with what\nhe considered  the slow pace  at which Homeowners  was processing\nthe  loans and,  after a  dispute  with Homeowners,  retained the\nservices  of  East  West to  continue  the  project.   East  West\ncontinued where Homeowners left off  with Bay Loan again agreeing\nto act as the end loan financier.\n\n3   The brokers  would not  provide the  financing to the  buyers\nwithout first getting  Bay Loan's agreement to  purchase and fund\nthe loans.  In fact, Homeowner's line of credit for issuing funds\nto the  buyers specifically prohibited the  disbursement of money\nwithout  a commitment from the ultimate lender, in this case, Bay\nLoan, to fund the loan.\n\n                               -7-\n\nset the terms and conditions of each mortgage.\n\n          As Bay Loan Vice  President of consumer lending, Joseph\n\nGormley,  explained to Brandon, the bank required each buyer of a\n\ncondominium unit  to make  at least  a  20% down  payment to  the\n\nseller,  Dean  Street,  before  Bay Loan  could  fund  the loans.\n\nInstead  of  instructing  buyers  to provide  the  required  down\n\npayments,  however,  Brandon  concocted a  scheme  that permitted\n\nbuyers to  avoid the down payments  altogether.  As a  result, he\n\nwas  able to pursue his original goal of obtaining 100% financing\n\nfor the condominium  project.  The  scheme was formulated  during\n\nthe  spring  and   summer  of  1987  when   Brandon  had  several\n\ndiscussions  with,  among  other  people,  his  attorney,  George\n\nMarderosian,   and   co-defendant  Norman   Reisch,   another  of\n\nMarderosian's clients, concerning ways  that the 20% down payment\n\nrequirement \"might  be satisfied by alternative  methods or might\n\nbe  avoided.\"   During  that  period, Brandon  also  told another\n\nperson  involved in the conspiracy, Claude Limoges, that the down\n\npayments would be falsified.\n\n          Brandon  planned and  employed  three basic  methods of\n\nfalsifying  the  down payments.    The  first method  was  simply\n\nproviding money to the various buyers which the buyers would then\n\nuse to make the down payments to Dean Street.   Usually the money\n\ncame  from  third-party  investors  to whom  Brandon  promised  a\n\ncommission for each  down payment  they funded.   Once the  buyer\n\nmade  the down payment to  Dean Street, Dean  Street would return\n\nthe  money to  the  investor leaving  a  paper trail  for  a down\n\n                               -8-\n\npayment that was never actually made.  The second method involved\n\nobtaining down payment  checks from the buyers  and promising not\n\nto  cash them.  Copies of these nonnegotiated checks would remain\n\nin the  loan file  to give  the  appearance that  real funds  had\n\nactually been  transferred.   The  third  method was  to  provide\n\nsecond  mortgages to the buyers  to fund their  down payments and\n\nthen to discharge those mortgages after the closings.4\n\n          The first method of avoiding down payments was employed\n\nfrom  the outset of the scheme.  Co-defendants Charles Gauvin and\n\nMarvin Granoff,  two clients of Marderosian,  agreed with Brandon\n\nto purchase some units at the Charlestown  Motor Inn.  Gauvin and\n\nGranoff also agreed to provide down payment funds to other buyers\n\nfor  subsequent unit sales.  Brandon promised them $1000 for each\n\nunit  sold with their  down payment  funds.   In August  of 1987,\n\nGauvin,  Granoff and  a third  person each purchased  four units.\n\nMarderosian conducted the closing  and co-defendant Owen Landman,\n\nan  attorney who shared  office space with  Marderosian, acted as\n\nescrow  agent.   During  the  closing,  Marderosian recorded  the\n\namount of each down payment ($20,500) on the closing statements -\n\n- also called the HUD settlement sheets -- as \"amounts paid by or\n\nin behalf of borrower.\"5\n\n          Gauvin provided the down payment funds for these twelve\n\n                    \n\n4   Brandon also  falsified the  loan  applications of  otherwise\nunqualified buyers.\n\n5   Throughout the project, the HUD settlement sheets were signed\nby  Brandon  and  the  buyers,  including  those  defendants  who\npurchased units.\n\n                               -9-\n\npurchases but no actual payment was ever made; instead, the funds\n\nwere  passed through Dean Street and returned  to Gauvin.  At the\n\nclosing, Gauvin delivered twelve separate checks for $20,500 each\n\nto Marderosian, drawn on an account that only had a $6000 balance\n\nat  the  time, and  Landman deposited  the  checks in  his escrow\n\naccount.    Landman then  wrote  twelve  corresponding checks  to\n\nMarderosian who in turn wrote checks to Dean Street for identical\n\namounts  of  $20,500 each.   Two  days  later, Dean  Street wrote\n\ntwelve checks back to Gauvin for the same amounts of $20,500 each\n\nand Gauvin  deposited the money in the  original checking account\n\nto  cover his initial twelve  checks written as  down payments to\n\nthe seller.\n\n          In late  August and September of  1987, Gauvin provided\n\ndown  payments for the purchase of units at the Charlestown Motor\n\nInn and at the  Bayside Motel by Reisch and others.   As with the\n\nfirst  purchases, Dean  Street  returned the  down payment  money\n\nwithin a matter of days and also paid Gauvin  an additional $1000\n\nper unit.\n\n          In the beginning of 1988, Bay Loan began requiring that\n\ndown payments be made  with certified funds.  Gauvin  and Granoff\n\nagreed to provide  buyers with  funds so that  they could  obtain\n\ncertified checks before the closings.  In January and February of\n\n1988, Granoff supplied $470,000  to Marderosian who deposited the\n\nfunds  and began  distributing the  money to  prospective buyers.\n\nThe  original intention was that  Dean Street would  pay back the\n\nmoney to Granoff a few days after  each closing as it had done in\n\n                               -10-\n\nthe previous transactions.   Brandon, however, never returned the\n\nmoney as planned.6 \n\n          With  no more  money  coming from  Gauvin and  Granoff,\n\nBrandon discussed the possibility  of funding buyer down payments\n\nwith  Reisch.  Reisch had earlier supplied down payment money for\n\na buyer and  was reimbursed by Dean Street the  next day.  Reisch\n\nagreed to provide the money, but only if he could  wire the money\n\ndirectly to the buyers  on a transaction by transaction  basis in\n\norder  to avoid  having large  amounts outstanding.   Funds  were\n\nwired  to buyers on several  occasions and the  buyers then wrote\n\ndown  payment  checks with  the money.    The checks  were either\n\ndeposited in  Landman's escrow account or  endorsed directly back\n\nover  to Reisch.  Those  funds deposited in  escrow were promptly\n\nreturned to Reisch.\n\n          The second  method of  falsifying down  payments, using\n\nnonnegotiated checks,  was employed less frequently.   In October\n\nof 1987,  co-defendants Ronald  Hagopian and John  Ward purchased\n\nseveral units at the Bayside Motel using nonnegotiated checks for\n\ntheir down payments.   Brandon also  enlisted Hagopian and  Ward,\n\nboth  real  estate  brokers,  to solicit  other  buyers  for  the\n\nproject.  Hagopian and Ward told  several of the buyers they  had\n\nrecruited  to provide  down  payment checks  which they  promised\n\nwould never be cashed.  These buyers proceeded to write checks to\n\nDean Street and those checks were never negotiated. \n\n                    \n\n6   Brandon  did eventually  agree to  a repayment  schedule but,\nultimately, none of Granoff's money was ever repaid.\n\n                               -11-\n\n          The  third  method  of  falsifying  down  payments  was\n\nthrough  dischargeable mortgages.    Joseph Gormley  at Bay  Loan\n\napproved a  plan  for buyers  to make  only 5%  down payments  in\n\ncertified funds with the  balance of a required 25%  down payment\n\nto be satisfied  by a  second mortgage provided  by Dean  Street.\n\nDean Street  began providing these  mortgages to the  buyers, but\n\nthe  mortgages  were  promptly  discharged7  after  the  closings\n\nbecause  Dean  Street never  actually  intended  to obligate  the\n\nbuyers.   The discharges were  accomplished by a  \"purchase price\n\nadjustment\" given  to buyers after the sale  to \"compensate\" them\n\nfor promised renovations that Dean  Street was suddenly unable to\n\nmake.  In reality,  the renovations \"were never going  to happen\"\n\nin the first place.\n\n          At the closings, some of the buyers  inquired about the\n\nsecond  mortgage   documents  because  Brandon  had   promised  a\n\ndischarge  and the  buyers wanted  to know  when that  would take\n\nplace.   The \"purchase price adjustment\"  letters that discharged\n\nthe mortgages were excluded from the closing documentation so the\n\nbank would not see  them.  During the closings,  Landman gestured\n\nto several buyers that they should not mention the matter to him.\n\nBrandon's assistant  at Dean  Street, co-defendant Momi  Kumalae,\n\ndid  speak to buyers about  the discharges and  assured them that\n\nthey  would be taken  care of.   Kumalae also signed  many of the\n\n                    \n\n7   Testimony was offered  by defendants  to the effect  that the\ndischarges provided  by Dean Street were  not legally enforceable\nand that the  buyers are still  obligated on the  mortgages.   We\nfind this  possibility irrelevant  as the intent  was clearly  to\ndischarge the mortgages.\n\n                               -12-\n\ndischarge letters sent to the buyers.\n\n          Despite  the sale of almost  200 units, by  the fall of\n\n1988,  the  loan  proceeds  from  Bay  Loan's  financing of  unit\n\npurchases was falling  well short of  Dean Street's expenses  and\n\nits own debt service.   Dean Street quickly fell  behind schedule\n\nin making the mortgage  payments on all the Bay  Loan condominium\n\nunit  loans,  and it  eventually stopped  making any  payments by\n\nearly 1989. \n\n          Between August  1987 and October 1988,  Dean Street had\n\nsold 196 units to 79 different  buyers, all financed by Bay  Loan\n\nin  176 separate loans.   The face  value of the  loans was $18.8\n\nmillion  and  Bay  Loan  actually distributed  $17.3  million  to\n\nMarderosian who passed on about $16.9 million to Dean Street (the\n\nbalance  was retained as  fees or was paid  to Landman for escrow\n\nservices).  As of the trial, approximately $16.3 million remained\n\noutstanding on the loans.\n\n          Gormley  at Bay Loan,  who approved the  loans, did not\n\nknow that down  payment funds  came from sources  other than  the\n\nbuyers, that  some down payments were  nonnegotiated checks, that\n\nsecond mortgages were being discharged, or that buyers were being\n\npaid to purchase units.  Gormley testified that he would not have\n\napproved  the  loans  if  he  had  been aware  of  any  of  these\n\ncircumstances.\n\n          On February 28, 1991,  a federal grand jury sitting  in\n\nthe District of  Rhode Island handed  down a 27-count  indictment\n\ncharging the eight appellants and four others with defrauding Bay\n\n                               -13-\n\nLoan, a federally insured financial institution, of approximately\n\n$18  million.    Count  1  charged  all  twelve  defendants  with\n\nconspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of  18 U.S.C.   371.\n\nCounts 2  through 27  charged various defendants  with individual\n\nacts of bank  fraud, under 18 U.S.C.   1344,  based on individual\n\nloan transactions executed during  the scheme to defraud.8   Four\n\nof the defendants pleaded guilty and did not go to trial.  Two of\n\nthe four,  George Marderosian  and Claude Limoges,  testified for\n\nthe government.  \n\n          After a  trial in the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode  Island, the jury found all  the defendants\n\nguilty of conspiracy and each defendant guilty on multiple counts\n\nof bank fraud.  Some defendants were acquitted on individual bank\n\nfraud charges as discussed below.  This appeal followed. \n\n        II.  FAILURE OF THE INDICTMENT TO STATE AN OFFENSE\n\n          Defendants first  argue that  the indictment  failed to\n\nstate  an offense with respect to the conspiracy count because it\n\ndid not allege that the United  States or one of its agencies was\n\nthe target of the conspiracy.   Count I of the indictment charged\n\ndefendants  with  conspiring to  commit  an  offense against  the\n\n                    \n\n8  One bank fraud count was later dismissed by  the government so\nthat 26  total counts remained  for trial.  Brandon  was the only\ndefendant charged in all of the counts.\n\n   Each  bank fraud count charges  one or more  of the defendants\nwith facilitating  in some  way the fraudulent  representation of\nthe required down payment  for a specific loan for  an individual\ncondominium unit.  Although each unit purchase allegedly involved\nthe  same fraudulent scheme,  only 26 specific  executions of the\nscheme were originally charged.\n\n                               -14-\n\nUnited States  in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    371  by executing  a\n\nscheme to defraud Bay Loan  under 18 U.S.C.   1344.   Section 371\n\nmakes  it a  crime  to \"conspire  either  to commit  any  offense\n                                        \n\nagainst  the United States, or  to defraud the  United States, or\n                              \n\nany  agency thereof\" (emphasis added).  The Supreme Court held in\n\nTanner  v. United States, 483  U.S. 107, 128-132  (1987), that in\n                        \n\norder to establish a  conspiracy to \"defraud the  United States,\"\n\nunder the second clause of    371, the government must prove that\n\nthe  target of  the fraud  was the  United States  or one  of its\n\nagencies.    Id.  (finding   a  recipient  of  federal  financial\n               \n\nassistance  and supervision  not to  be an  agency of  the United\n\nStates for purposes of   371).  The defendants contend that  this\n\nrequirement  should be extended to the first  clause of   371 for\n\nalleged conspiracies  \"to commit  any offense against  the United\n\nStates.\"\n\n          18 U.S.C.   371 creates two distinct criminal offenses:\n\nconspiracies  to commit  offenses against  the United  States and\n\nconspiracies to  defraud the  United States.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Haga, 821 F.2d 1036,  1039 (5th Cir. 1987).   The \"any\n               \n\noffense\"  clause of   371 (\"to commit offenses against the United\n\nStates\")  is aimed  at conspiracies  to violate  the laws  of the\n\nUnited States.   It does not  refer to a  particular victim of  a\n\nparticular crime like the second clause does, but instead applies\n\ngenerally to  federal \"offenses.\"  The  Tanner requirement should\n                                              \n\nnot be extended to a large area of criminal conspiracies, such as\n\nmail  and  wire fraud,  that  victimize  persons  other than  the\n\n                               -15-\n\ngovernment or its agencies but traditionally have been prosecuted\n\nunder the  \"any offense\" clause of    371.  See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nFalcone, 960 F.2d 988,  990 (11th Cir.) (en banc),  cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. 292  (1992) (citing the reasoning in  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nFalcone, 934 F.2d 1528, 1548-51 (11th Cir.  1991) (Tjoflat, C.J.,\n       \n\nspecially concurring,  joined  by  Powell,  Assoc.  Justice,  and\n\nKravitch, J.) to overrule its previous extension of Tanner to the\n                                                          \n\n\"any offense\"  clause of   371 in United States v. Hope, 861 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1574  (11th Cir. 1988)); United  States v.

We therefore reject the contention that the\n\nindictment  must  assert that  the United  States  or one  of its\n\nagencies was a target of the alleged conspiracy in this case.\n\n           III.  MULTIPLICITY OF THE BANK FRAUD COUNTS\n\n          Defendants challenge the validity of the indictment for\n\ncharging  twenty-five individual  counts of  bank fraud  under 18\n\nU.S.C.    1344,  when, allegedly,  all the  counts relate  to the\n\nsingle  execution  of  one  scheme  to  defraud  Bay  Loan.    An\n\nindictment  is  multiplicitous  and  in violation  of  the  Fifth\n\nAmendment's Double Jeopardy Clause if it charges a single offense\n\nin more than  one count.  United States v.  Serino, 835 F.2d 924,\n                                                  \n\n930  (1st Cir. 1987).  Under the  bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.  \n\n1344,  each  execution  of  a  scheme  to defraud  constitutes  a\n\nseparate indictable offense.   United States v. George, 986  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1176,  1179  (8th Cir.),  cert. denied,  114  S. Ct.  269 (1993);\n                                      \n\nUnited States  v. Lemons, 941 F.2d 309, 317 (5th Cir. 1991).  The\n                        \n\n                               -16-\n\ncentral question for determining  multiplicity is \"whether a jury\n\ncould plausibly find that the actions described in the [disputed]\n\ncounts  of   the  indictment,  objectively   viewed,  constituted\n\nseparate  executions of the [bank  fraud] scheme.\"  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 303 (1st Cir. 1992).\n        \n\n          A number of factors are relevant in determining whether\n\na single or multiple  executions of bank fraud have  taken place,\n\nincluding  the number of  banks, the number  of transactions, and\n\nthe number of movements of money involved in the scheme.   Lilly,\n                                                                \n\n983  F.2d at  305.   Each time  an identifiable  sum of  money is\n\nobtained by a specific fraudulent transaction, there is likely to\n\nbe  a separate execution  of the scheme  to defraud.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States v. Barnhart, 979 F.2d 647, 650-51 (8th Cir. 1992);\n                          \n\nUnited States v. Mason,  902 F.2d 1434, 1436-38 (9th  Cir. 1990);\n                      \n\nUnited States v. Poliak, 823 F.2d 371, 372 (9th Cir. 1987), cert.\n                                                                \n\ndenied, 485 U.S. 1029 (1988).\n      \n\n          The government's position  is that each transaction  in\n\nwhich Bay  Loan provided a mortgage  (or end loan) to  a buyer on\n\nthe  basis of  a  fraudulent  representation  of a  down  payment\n\nconstitutes  a single,  independent  execution of  the scheme  to\n\ndefraud.  We think that this position is the correct one when the\n\nscheme  is viewed  properly from  an objective  standpoint.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLilly,  983  F.2d  at 303  (finding  that  the  scheme should  be\n     \n\n\"objectively viewed\" to determine multiplicity).\n\n          The  basic  scheme to  defraud  Bay  Loan involved  the\n\nfraudulent representation  of buyers'  down payments in  order to\n\n                               -17-\n\nobtain loan financing from the bank for Dean Street's condominium\n\nunits.  The  scheme was not  designed to get  a set amount,  or a\n\npreconceived sum,  of money.   Instead, the scheme  functioned by\n\nobtaining  as many loans as  possible depending on  the number of\n\nbuyers Dean Street could recruit to apply for the mortgages.  The\n\nstructure  of the scheme was such that individual buyers would be\n\nbrought in to  submit separate loan  applications which would  be\n\nfraudulently prepared and then  sent on to Bay Loan  for approval\n\nand the disbursement of the funds for that individual sale.   Bay\n\nLoan  approved  each loan  separately  based  on each  individual\n\napplication and each loan corresponded  to an individual piece of\n\nproperty,  that is,  a  separate condominium  unit.   Objectively\n\nviewed, each loan  application appears to be a repeated execution\n\nof the basic scheme and not simply an additional step or stage of\n\none  unitary transaction.  Although only one bank was involved in\n\nthe  scheme, there were over  176 separate loans  to 79 different\n\nbuyers involving many  separate movements of money from  Bay Loan\n\nto the mortgage  brokers and  from the mortgage  brokers to  Dean\n\nStreet  during  the fifteen  months in  which  the scheme  was in\n\noperation.\n\n          The fact that the end loans were sometimes processed in\n\nbulk  does  not   alter  the  essential  nature  of  the  scheme.\n\nDefendants highlight the fact that, on some  occasions, groups of\n\nmortgage applications  were supplied to Bay Loan together and Bay\n\nLoan sometimes wired money to the brokers on a bulk  basis.  This\n\nwas  usually done, however, as  a matter of  convenience (such as\n\n                               -18-\n\nwhen several unit purchases closed at the same time) and not as a\n\nmethod  to package the financing in a way necessary to accomplish\n\na unified  scheme.9   Arguably,  one could  view this  case as  a\n\nsingle  execution by Dean Street of a broad scheme to use various\n\nbuyers as  fronts in order to  get financing for a  unitary motel\n\ncondominium project.   However, we  feel it makes  more sense  to\n\nlook at each  mortgage application  as an  individual attempt  to\n\nfraudulently obtain distinct amounts of money from Bay Loan.\n\n          This is not, as defendants assert, a situation like the\n\none in Lilly where  a group of fraudulent mortgages  was assigned\n            \n\nin  a  single  package of  documents  to  the  defrauded bank  as\n\nsecurity for  one sum  of money used  to buy  a single  apartment\n\ncomplex.   See id.  at  302-305.   In that  case,  there was  one\n                 \n\ntransaction with the defrauded bank which was  executed \"in order\n\nto  obtain a single loan,  the proceeds of  which funded a single\n\nreal estate purchase.\"   Id. at 303.  Consequently,  we found the\n                           \n\ncharges based on each mortgage to be multiplicitous.  The present\n\ncase is more akin to a check kiting scheme which we characterized\n\nin Lilly as involving multiple executions of a fraudulent  scheme\n        \n\nbecause  more than  one bank  was involved  and because,  \"[m]ore\n\n                    \n\n9   At one point, Brandon  could not guaranty clear  title to Bay\nLoan  on the  condominium units  until he  sold enough  units and\nobtained a large enough chunk of financing to pay off some of the\noriginal mortgages used  to buy  the motels in  the first  place.\nThis did necessitate  bulk processing of  unit mortgages so  that\nblocks of financing could be obtained at one time.  The execution\nof  the   fraud,  however,  still  remained   the  submission  of\nindividual loan applications as additional buyers were recruited.\nThe block processing of loans did not correspond to one  loan for\neach motel but  were instead an amalgamation of  individual loans\nfor individual condominium units.\n\n                               -19-\n\nimportantly,   each  check   signifies  a   separate  transaction\n\nrequiring  a separate issuance of money or  credit on the part of\n\nthe victimized bank.\" Id. at 304.\n                        \n\n          Similarly, the  other  cases cited  by defendants  that\n\ninvalidate indictments on grounds of multiplicity involve  single\n\nloan  transactions instead  of  the multiple  and separate  loans\n\nfraudulently obtained in this  case.  See United States  v. Saks,\n                                                                \n\n964  F.2d 1514, 1526 (5th Cir. 1992) (single loan transaction for\n\nsingle piece of property); United States v. Heath, 970 F.2d 1397,\n                                                 \n\n1401-02 (5th Cir.  1992), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct. 1643  (1993)\n                                       \n\n(two loans  involved in  the case  \"were integrally  related; one\n\ncould not have succeeded without the other\" and both were used to\n\naccomplish essentially one  integrated real estate  transaction);\n\nLemons, 941 F.2d at 316-18 (separate payments of loan proceeds to\n      \n\ndefendant  were  installments  from  a  single  loan  transaction\n\ninvolving a single project).   We hold, therefore, that  each end\n\nloan provided by Bay Loan was the result of a separate fraud upon\n\nthe bank which  the indictment properly charged  as an individual\n\nbank fraud offense.\n\n                 IV.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Seven of  the eight defendants argue  that the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial was insufficient to support their convictions\n\nfor  bank  fraud and  conspiracy to  commit  bank fraud.10   They\n\n                    \n\n10   Brandon does not  challenge the sufficiency  of the evidence\nagainst  him on appeal.   He does argue  that certain evidentiary\nrulings deprived him  of a fair  trial because he  was unable  to\npresent his  theory of  the case  and  convince the  jury of  his\ninnocence.   This issue  is discussed below  in Section VII.   We\n\n                               -20-\n\nargue,  with individual  variations, that they  did not  have the\n\nrequisite knowledge and  intent to defraud Bay  Loan because they\n\ndid  not  know  of,  or  intend  to  violate,  any  down  payment\n\nrequirements of  the bank.   With  the few exceptions  previously\n\nnoted, we disagree.  Before  reviewing the evidence with  respect\n\nto each  defendant, we must  first address some  issues regarding\n\nthe substantive offenses charged in this case.\n\n                         A.  The Offenses\n\n                          1.  Bank Fraud\n\n          To  prove  bank fraud  under  18 U.S.C.     1344,11 the\n\nprosecution  must  show  beyond   a  reasonable  doubt  that  the\n\ndefendant (1) engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or made\n\n                    \n\nnote for the record that the evidence against Brandon is not only\nsufficient but overwhelming.\n\n11   At the  time when  the offenses occurred,  18 U.S.C.    1344\nprovided:\n\n            Whoever  knowingly executes,  or attempts\n            to execute, a  scheme or artifice --  (1)\n            to  defraud  a  federally   chartered  or\n            insured financial institution; or  (2) to\n            obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits,\n            assets,  securities,  or  other  property\n            owned by, or under the custody or control\n            of  a  federally  chartered   or  insured\n            financial institution, by means  of false\n            or fraudulent pretenses, representations,\n            or  promises;  [shall  be  guilty  of  an\n            offense against the United States].\n\n   A  technical amendment  in 1989  deleted the  words \"federally\nchartered or  insured\" from  the section leaving  just \"financial\ninstitution.\"  Pub. L.  No. 101-73, Title IX,    961(k), Aug.  9,\n1989,  103 Stat.  500.   Apparently,  no  substantive change  was\nintended  by  this  amendment  as the  definition  of  \"financial\ninstitution\" for all  of Title 18,  now contained at 18  U.S.C.  \n20,   still   encompasses   federally   chartered    or   insured\ninstitutions.\n\n                               -21-\n\nfalse statements or misrepresentations  to obtain money from; (2)\n\na  federally  insured  financial  institution;  and  (3)  did  so\n\nknowingly.  United States v. Goldblatt, 813 F.2d 619, 623-24 (3rd\n                                      \n\nCir. 1987); United States v.

The terms  \"scheme\" and\n             \n\n\"artifice\"  are defined to include \"any plan, pattern or cause of\n\naction,    including   false   and   fraudulent   pretenses   and\n\nmisrepresentations, intended to deceive others in order to obtain\n\nsomething of value,  such as  money, from the  institution to  be\n\ndeceived.\"  Goldblatt, 813  F.2d at 624 (citing United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nToney,  598 F.2d 1349, 1357  n.12 (5th Cir.  1979), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n444 U.S. 1033 (1983)).   \"The term 'scheme to  defraud,' however,\n\nis  not capable of precise definition.  Fraud instead is measured\n\nin  a   particular  case   by  determining  whether   the  scheme\n\ndemonstrated   a  departure   from  fundamental   honesty,  moral\n\nuprightness, or fair play and candid dealings in the general life\n\nof  the community.\"  Goldblatt, 813  F.2d at 624; see also United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.  Stavroulakis, 952  F.2d  686,  694 (2d  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                                \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 1982 (1992).\n      \n\n          The  alleged  scheme in  this  case  is the  fraudulent\n\nrepresentation of  down payments that  were not actually  paid in\n\norder to obtain  loan financing from Bay  Loan.  There is  little\n\ndoubt  that   this  scheme  took  place.12     Defendants  argue,\n\n                    \n\n12   Sufficient evidence exists to indicate Bay Loan provided the\nloans for the Dean Street project, required down payments for the\nloans, and  approved  loans  and  disbursed money  based  on  the\nunderstanding that  its lending  requirement was satisfied.   The\nevidence  also clearly  establishes  that no  down payments  were\n\n                               -22-\n\nhowever,  that they  did  not know  of,  or participate  in,  the\n\nscheme,  and,  to  the  extent   that  they  did  participate  in\n\nactivities  related to the scheme, such  actions were not illegal\n\nbecause the actions were  not intended to deceive or  defraud Bay\n\nLoan.   Defendants claim they  were either unaware  that Bay Loan\n\nexisted  or else  unaware  that  Bay  Loan  had  a  down  payment\n\nrequirement that prohibited the various down payment transactions\n\nin  which they  were  involved.   The  central issue  on  appeal,\n\ntherefore,   is  whether   defendants  possessed   the  requisite\n\nknowledge and intent.\n\n          \"To  act with  the  'intent to  defraud'  means to  act\n\nwillfully, and with the  specific intent to deceive or  cheat for\n\nthe  purpose of either causing some financial loss to another, or\n\nbringing  about some financial gain to oneself.\"  Cloud, 872 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 852 n.6 (citations  omitted) (finding intent to defraud  where\n\ndefendant  signed instructions  \"knowing that  the bank  could be\n\ndeceived by materially false statements that appeared on the face\n\nof the instructions\"); see  also United States v. Saks,  964 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1514,  1518 (5th Cir. 1992).  \"It is a well-established principle\n\nthat fraudulent  intent  may  be  established  by  circumstantial\n\nevidence and inferences drawn from all the evidence.\"  Cloud, 872\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\nactually  made to Dean  Street because  the payments  were either\nfalsified or quickly  returned to their  source.  Defendants  did\npresent evidence,  mostly testimony by Brandon  himself, that Bay\nLoan  knew  and  approved   of  the  down  payment  arrangements.\nHowever,  more than  sufficient evidence  points to  the contrary\nconclusion including the unequivocal testimony of Bay Loan's Vice\nPresident, Gormley, that the  bank never knew of nor  approved of\nthe skirting of the down payment requirement.\n\n                               -23-\n\nF.2d at 852  n.6 (citations omitted);  United States v.

Green, 745 F.2d 1205,\n                                                 \n\n1207 (9th Cir. 1984) (additional internal quotation omitted))).\n\n          Defendants argue  that the  government must  prove that\n\nthey knew that  the victim of their fraud was a federally insured\n\nfinancial institution.  We  disagree.  The status of  the victim-\n\ninstitution is  not a separate  knowledge element  of bank  fraud\n\nunder   1344 but  an objective fact that  must be established  in\n\norder  for  the  statute  to  apply.    The  government  produced\n\nevidence,  and defendants  do  not  dispute,  that  Bay  Loan  is\n\nfederally insured.  This is sufficient to satisfy the requirement\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.    1344 that  the defrauded bank  be a  federally\n\ninsured bank.   See United  States v. McClelland,  868 F.2d  704,\n                                                \n\n709-11 (5th Cir. 1989);  cf. United States v.

Trice,  823 F.2d 80,  86-87 (5th Cir.\n                                 \n\n                               -24-\n\n1987) (same).13 \n\n          We decline to  adopt defendants' analogy to  one of the\n\nfederal gambling  statutes, 18 U.S.C.    1084(a),  which we  have\n\npreviously held  requires knowledge  of the interstate  nature of\n\nthe wire communication involved in the offense.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSouthard,  700 F.2d 1, 24-25  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 464 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n823 (1983).  Our holding in that case rested on the fact that the\n\nword \"knowingly\"  in the  statute could not  reasonably refer  to\n\nanything else except the  interstate nature of the communication.\n\nId.  at 24 (noting one  cannot unwittingly or  unknowingly make a\n  \n\nwire transmission).   That is not  the case  with the bank  fraud\n\nstatute  because \"knowingly\"  in    1344  clearly applies  to the\n\n                    \n\n13  We find the language of   1014 sufficiently similar to   1344\nto  warrant  a similar  conclusion  about  Congress' intent  with\nrespect to the knowledge  requirement in the bank fraud  statute.\n18 U.S.C.   1014 states in pertinent part:\n\n            \"Whoever   knowingly   makes  any   false\n            statement   or   report,   or   willfully\n            overvalues   any    land,   property   or\n            security, for the purpose  of influencing\n            in  any  way  the  action of  .  .  . any\n            institution  the  accounts  of which  are\n            insured by the Federal  Deposit Insurance\n            Corporation  [shall  be   guilty  of   an\n            offense against the Unites States].\"\n\n   Defendants contend that the use of \"knowingly\" in this statute\ndiffers  significantly from  its use  in    1344  which prohibits\nknowingly executing a scheme \"to defraud a federally chartered or\ninsured financial institution.\"  We reject this  contention.  The\nplacement in   1344 of the words \"federally chartered or insured\"\nbefore the  word \"institution\" instead of  similar language being\nplaced after  \"institution,\" as  in    1014, simply  reflects the\nfact  that federal  insurance  is separately  defined in  another\nsubsection  and thus  there is no  need to  use the  more awkward\nconstruction  found in   1014.  The different word placement is a\ndistinction without a difference.\n\n                               -25-\n\nexecution  of  a  scheme  or  artifice  to  defraud.    The  word\n\n\"knowingly\" is necessary because one can execute a scheme without\n\nknowing or understanding that it is fraudulent.  In fact, that is\n\nwhat many of the defendants themselves argue in this appeal: that\n\nthey  may have facilitated the  false down payments  but they did\n\nnot  know  it  violated  the  bank's  requirements.    Therefore,\n\n\"knowingly\" in    1344 has independent  meaning without reference\n\nto the federally insured status of the financial institution.\n\n          The  defendants  in  this  case  also  argue  that  the\n\ngovernment  must prove they knew that the end loans were provided\n\nby Bay Loan and not by some other institution, such as Homeowners\n\nor East West.  In other words,  there was no violation of    1344\n\nbecause the scheme  to defraud  was not knowingly  targeted at  a\n\nfederally insured financial institution,  but instead at the non-\n\nfederally insured mortgage brokers.\n\n          Defendants  overstate the  government's  burden.    The\n\nspecific intent under   1344 is an intent to defraud a bank, that\n\nis, an  intent to  victimize  a bank  by  means of  a  fraudulent\n\nscheme.  See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 694 (2d\n                                          \n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Mason, 902 F.2d 1434, 1442 (9th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1990).  It has been established that the government does not have\n\nto  show  the   alleged  scheme  was  directed  solely  toward  a\n                                                      \n\nparticular institution;  it is sufficient to  show that defendant\n\nknowingly executed  a fraudulent scheme that  exposed a federally\n\ninsured  bank to  a risk of  loss.   See, e.g.,  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBarakett,  994 F.2d 1107,  1110-11 (5th Cir.  1993), petition for\n                                                                 \n\n                               -26-\n\ncert.  filed, (Sept.  22,  1993) (fraudulent  scheme directed  at\n            \n\nchecking account customers  of bank but fraud  victimized bank as\n\nwell); United States v.

In creating\n\nthe  statute,  Congress noted  that  \"there is  a  strong Federal\n\ninterest  in  protecting   the  financial   integrity  of   these\n\ninstitutions, and  the legislation  in this  part would  assure a\n\nbasis for Federal prosecution of those who victimize these  banks\n\nthrough fraudulent  schemes.\"   Id.   Thus, Congress  intended to\n                                  \n\ncriminalize bank  frauds that  harm federally insured  banks, not\n\n                    \n\n14   We also reject  a related claim  made by  several defendants\nthat the district court had no jurisdiction over their bank fraud\ncounts because the target of the alleged bank fraud -- Homeowners\nor  East West  as opposed  to  Bay Loan  -- was  not a  federally\ninsured financial institution.   Bay Loan was  in fact victimized\nby  defendants' scheme to defraud.   In addition,  the scheme was\ndesigned  to  obtain  funds  from  Bay  Loan  in   particular  by\nfraudulently  avoiding one of Bay Loan's requirements.  This more\nthan satisfies the requirements for federal jurisdiction.\n\n                               -27-\n\njust bank  frauds directed specifically toward  federally insured\n\nbanks.   As  other courts  have noted,  \"the legislative  history\n\nsupports  a broad construction of the  statutory language\" of the\n\nbank   fraud  statute.    Mason,  902  F.2d  at  1442;  see  also\n                                                                 \n\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 694. \n            \n\n          Defendants  are essentially  seeking to  sanitize their\n\nfraud  by interposing  an  intermediary or  an additional  victim\n\nbetween  their fraud and the  federally insured bank.   We reject\n\nthis  attempt  to escape  the reach  of  the bank  fraud statute.\n\nInstead, we find that  defendants need not have had  the specific\n\nintent to defraud  Bay Loan so long  as they intended to  defraud\n\nsome financial institution.   The  fact that it  should turn  out\n\nthat the financial  institution actually defrauded  was federally\n\ninsured is a fortuitous stroke of bad luck for the defendants but\n\ndoes  not make it  any less  of a federal  crime.   In this case,\n\nevidence beyond  a reasonable doubt that  defendants fraudulently\n\nevaded  a known down  payment requirement, whether  thought to be\n\nimposed  by  Homeowners,  East  West,  Bay  Loan  or  some  other\n\nfinancing  entity,   is  sufficient  to  support   a  bank  fraud\n\nconviction.  Of course, the government must also establish that a\n\nfederally  insured bank, Bay Loan, was victimized or exposed to a\n\nrisk  of loss  by the scheme  to defraud.   See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBlackmon, 839 F.2d 900,  906 (2d Cir.  1988).  This, however,  is\n        \n\nnot seriously disputed in this case.15\n\n                    \n\n15   The  down  payment scheme  victimized  Bay Loan  because  it\ndevalued the  mortgages  that  the  bank  was  providing.    Down\npayments on a loan  decrease the risk of default  or nonrepayment\n\n                               -28-\n\n          Concerns about  extending the  reach of the  bank fraud\n\nstatute  into broad new areas  of financial activity  stem from a\n\nmisunderstanding  of  the  nature  of  the  statute.    Financial\n\ntransactions are becoming increasingly integrated and  complex as\n\nmore and more financial instruments are securitized and traded on\n\nnational  and  global  markets.   Consequently,  the  effects  of\n\nfraudulent  actions  against  one  institution  are  increasingly\n\nlikely to  spill  over  and  detrimentally  affect  others.    As\n\nCongress'  main concern in   1344 was to provide jurisdiction for\n\nfraudulent  schemes  that harmed  federally chartered  or insured\n\ninstitutions, the  increased risks to the  institutions should be\n\nmatched  by  increased  coverage of  the  statute.    We are  not\n\nfederalizing  criminal  transactions previously  covered  only by\n\nstate law so much as recognizing that those criminal transactions\n\n                    \n\nby increasing the equity participation of the borrower and giving\nthe borrower  a larger stake in  the venture.  The  down payments\nconsequently have value  to the  lender bank and  the failure  to\nmake them deprives the bank  of this value.  Cf. Mason,  902 F.2d\n                                                      \nat 1441-43  (finding  intent  to commit  bank  fraud  where  bank\nexposed to risk of loss  through defendants' concealment from the\nbank that its customers were purchasing prostitution services and\nconsequently were a  greater credit  risk to the  bank which  was\nprocessing the customers' credit  card purchases from defendants'\nescort service).\n\n   The fact that buyers were required to make their down payments\nto the seller, Dean Street, does not mitigate the risk of loss to\nBay Loan  from the down payment  scheme.  There would  still be a\nhigher risk  of default and  the absence of  equity participation\nregardless  of who was receiving, or failing to receive, the down\npayments.  In addition, the value of the condominiums, the bank's\ncollateral,  becomes an issue where the bank, thinking it is only\nproviding  80% of the purchase price, is actually lending 100% of\nthe sale price.   Ultimately,  Bay Loan refused  to provide  100%\nfinancing  and explicitly  required a  down payment;  the payment\nbecame  a negotiated term of  the mortgage contract  and thus had\nsome value to Bay Loan.\n\n                               -29-\n\nare becoming more federal in nature.16\n\n          An  additional argument  defendants  make  is that  the\n\ngovernment  must  prove  defendants  knew that  Bay  Loan's  down\n\npayment   requirement  specifically  prohibited  the  funding  of\n\nbuyers'  down   payments  by   someone  other  than   the  buyer.\n\nDefendants claim  that they  thought the  funding  of buyer  down\n\npayments   was   just   some   complex   financial   arrangement,\n\n\"supplemental financing\" or required  paperwork, and they did not\n\nknow the funding was designed to defraud the bank.\n\n          This misrepresents  the nature of the  fraud.  Although\n\nBay  Loan  did  in fact  prohibit  third  party  funding of  down\n\npayments, the  key misrepresentation in  this case  was that  the\n\nrequired down payments  were being paid  when they actually  were\n\nnot.  Bay Loan required  the buyers to make down payments  to the\n\nseller,  Dean  Street,  and the  existence  of  the  payments was\n\nrepresented to the  bank on  the closing settlement  sheets.   In\n\nreality,  the payments  were not  being  made, either  because no\n\nfunds  were  actually  transferred  or  because  the  funds  were\n\n                    \n\n16  We do not  address whether any scheme to defraud,  regardless\nof  its intended victim, can  be prosecuted under  the bank fraud\nstatute  as long as it has some detrimental effect on a federally\ninsured bank.   In this case at  least, the government  did prove\nthe  scheme  was intended  to  defraud  a financial  institution:\nHomeowners or East West, if not Bay Loan itself.\n\n   We also  do not  address possible statutory  or jurisdictional\nlimitations on the  remoteness or foreseeability  of the harm  or\nthe  risk of  loss  to federally  insured financial  institutions\nbeyond which    1344 will no  longer apply.  We  simply note that\nthis  case  presents  a situation  of  direct  harm  to Bay  Loan\nresulting  from a  scheme specifically  designed to  fraudulently\navoid the requirements of that federally insured bank in order to\nobtain funds originating directly from Bay Loan.\n\n                               -30-\n\nreturned  by Dean  Street  to  their  source.17   Therefore,  the\n\ngovernment need  only prove that  defendants knew a  down payment\n\nwas required and that  no real down payments were  actually made.\n\nIt need not establish  that defendants knew all of  the specifics\n\nof  the down payment  requirement such  as restrictions  on third\n\nparty funding.\n\n          In sum,  to prove  defendants knowingly engaged  in the\n\nfraud,  the government  must establish  that each  defendant knew\n\nthat some  financial institution  was lending  the money  for the\n\nmotel-condominium project, knew that  a down payment was required\n\nfor  these  loans, knew  that  a scheme  of one  sort  or another\n\nexisted to make it appear that the down payments were being  made\n\nwhen  in fact  they were  not, and  finally, that  each defendant\n\nwillfully participated in that scheme.\n\n                          2.  Conspiracy\n\n          Each defendant contests the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nof his or her knowledge of the conspiracy to defraud Bay Loan and\n\nhis or her level of participation in that agreed upon scheme.  To\n\nprove conspiracy, the  government must show  the existence of  an\n\nagreement  between defendant  and  another to  commit a  crime,18\n\n                    \n\n17  In those cases where Dean Street failed to repay down payment\nfunds  as  promised, the  intention  was still  to do  so  and to\nexecute the same fraud as was executed on the other unit sales.\n\n18  To the extent that the existence of a conspiracy is at issue,\nthe  evidence is  overwhelming  to support  the  convictions.   A\nconspiracy is an agreement to commit  a crime and may be inferred\nfrom  the circumstances.  United States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942,\n                                                  \n950  (1st Cir.  1992).   Brandon planned  and executed  a complex\nscheme to  defraud  Bay Loan  that  required the  cooperation  of\ninvestors, brokers, and other agents involved in facilitating the\n\n                               -31-\n\nthat  each  defendant  knew  of  the  agreement,  and  that  each\n\ndefendant  voluntarily  participated  in  the  conspiracy through\n\nconduct that  was interdependent with  the actions  of the  other\n\nconspirators.  United States v. G mez-Pab n, 911 F.2d 847, 852-53\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir.  1990),  cert. denied,  498  U.S. 1074  (1993);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Evans,  970  F.2d 663,  668  (10th Cir.  1992),  cert.\n                                                                \n\ndenied, 113  S. Ct. 1288 (1993).   The defendants  must have both\n      \n\nthe  intent  to agree  to participate  in  the conspiracy  and an\n\nintent  to commit  the  underlying substantive  offense.   G mez-\n                                                                 \n\nPab n, 911 F.2d at 853; United States v. Drougas, 748  F.2d 8, 15\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir. 1984).  The  government, however, need  not prove that\n\neach   defendant  knew  all  of  the   details  and  members,  or\n\nparticipated  in all of the objectives, of the conspiracy as long\n\nas  it can show knowledge  of the basic  agreement.  G mez-Pab n,\n                                                                \n\n911 F.2d at  853;  United  States v. Marsh,  747 F.2d 7,  13 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1984).   Such proof of knowledge and intent  \"may consist of\n\ncircumstantial  evidence,  including inferences  from surrounding\n\ncircumstances,  such  as acts  committed  by  the defendant  that\n\nfurthered the  conspiracy's purposes.\"  G mez-Pab n,  911 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n853.\n\n          The   government   must   also  establish   defendants'\n\nparticipation in the  conspiracy with the  intent to further  the\n\n                    \n\ntransactions.  Brandon told  several co-conspirators of his plans\nto falsify down payments, including  Marderosian, Reisch, Gauvin,\nGranoff,  Hagopian,  and  Ward.   The  evidence  indicates  these\ndefendants  agreed  to  become  involved  in  the  conspiracy  by\nperforming such critical tasks as drawing up mortgage discharges,\nwiring money, and providing down payment checks that would not be\nused.\n\n                               -32-\n\naims of the  conspiracy.  Direct Sales Co.  v. United States, 319\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 703, 712 (1943).   Once a conspiracy is established, as well\n\nas  defendant's intent to further it,  any connection between the\n\ndefendant  and  the  conspiracy,  even  a  slight  one,  will  be\n\nsufficient to  establish knowing participation.   Marsh, 747 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 13. \n\n          In  this  case,  the  government must  prove  that  the\n\ndefendants knew there was  an agreement to fraudulently represent\n\ndown payments in  order to get loans from Bay  Loan and that they\n\nwillfully participated in this scheme by taking some overt action\n\nwith the intent  to further  the scheme's objective.   Thus,  the\n\nevidence must  be sufficient to  establish the  intent to  commit\n\nbank  fraud  as discussed  above  and,  in  addition,  must  also\n\nestablish an intent to  commit the fraud in conjunction  with the\n\nbroader conspiratorial agreement.\n\n               B.  The Case Against Each Defendant\n\n          Our  task on review of  the verdicts is  to examine the\n\nevidence  in  its entirety  in the  light  most favorable  to the\n\ngovernment to determine  whether a rational  trier of fact  could\n\nhave  found  the  essential  elements   of  the  crime  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.   The government  receives the  benefit of  all\n\nlegitimate and favorable inferences, and it can prove its case by\n\ncircumstantial  evidence   without   having  to   exclude   every\n\nreasonable hypothesis of innocence.  United States v. McLaughlin,\n                                                                \n\n957 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Boldt, 929 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n35,  39 (1st. Cir. 1991);  United States v.  Van Helden, 920 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n                               -33-\n\n99, 101 (1st Cir. 1990).  Below, we review each defendant's  case\n\nindividually.\n\n                        1.  Marvin Granoff\n\n          Granoff was  convicted of conspiracy and  two counts of\n\nbank  fraud in  connection  with his  purchase  of units  on  one\n\noccasion and with his  funding of buyer down payments  on another\n\noccasion.    Granoff argues  that the  evidence  in this  case is\n\ninsufficient to show that  he was anything more than  an innocent\n\ninvestor duped  by his lawyer, Marderosian,  into providing money\n\nfor a project  he really did not  know anything about.   Although\n\nthe evidence against Marvin  Granoff reveals a more circumscribed\n\nrole than some of  the other defendants,  we are not prepared  to\n\noverturn  the  jury's guilty  verdict  on  either the  conspiracy\n\ncharge or on the two counts of bank fraud.\n\n          Sufficient evidence supports the jury's conclusion that\n\nGranoff  knew  Bay Loan  was  funding  Dean Street's  condominium\n\nproject, that he knew down payments were required from the buyers\n\nand that he  knowingly participated  in a scheme  to deceive  the\n\nbank into thinking the requirement was satisfied.  To begin with,\n\nGranoff  bought four  units  on one  occasion  and provided  down\n\npayment  funds on another occasion.  Both times Bay Loan financed\n\nthe purchases without knowing the required down payments were not\n\nactually made.    Prior to  each of  these transactions,  Granoff\n\nattended a series of  meetings with Brandon concerning the  motel\n\ncondominium scheme.  Brandon told Granoff that down payments were\n\nrequired and that he needed Granoff to provide money for the down\n\n                               -34-\n\npayments of other buyers.19  Granoff agreed to do so.20\n\n          For Granoff's purchase of  units at the Charlestown Inn\n\n                    \n\n19  Specifically, Marderosian  testified that Brandon told Gauvin\nand Granoff in  the summer  of 1987 that  \"Homeowners required  a\ntwenty-five  percent down  payment  and while  that down  payment\nwould not  be required of Mr. Gauvin and Mr. Granoff, he did have\nthe problem of the down payment with subsequent purchasers and he\nasked  Mr. Gauvin and Mr. Granoff for their assistance in meeting\nthat problem.\"  Despite the offer to \"waive\" Gauvin and Granoff's\ndown payments,  checks representing  down payments were  required\nfor their purchases.\n\n   In  another meeting, Brandon asked  Gauvin and Granoff if they\nwere  \"willing  to  provide  the down  payment  money  for  other\npurchasers\" and they agreed to do so.  Marderosian also testified\nthat Brandon told Granoff at a meeting in January of 1988 that he\nneeded someone  to provide funding for the certified down payment\nfunds required  from unit buyers.   Brandon asked  whether Gauvin\nand Granoff were \"interested  in providing those certified funds\"\nand they agreed.\n\n20    Marderosian  testified   that  Granoff  agreed  on  several\ndifferent  occasions  to  participate  in  Brandon's  scheme  and\nreferred several  times  to the  \"agreement  Mr. Gauvin  and  Mr.\nGranoff  made to  provide Mr.  Brandon with  monies for  the down\npayments.\"    Despite  this, Granoff  argues  that  Marderosian's\ntestimony indicates Granoff said little or nothing at the various\nmeetings  with  Brandon and  this  is  insufficient to  establish\nGranoff agreed to participate  in the conspiracy.  The  fact that\nGranoff  provided  $470,000  that  was  used  for  down  payments\nfollowing the meetings  with Brandon in  which the agreement  was\ndiscussed, however, is sufficient  to support the conclusion that\nGranoff in fact did agree and did participate in the conspiracy.\n\n   Furthermore, Granoff's involvement in  the conspiracy was more\nthan just the  provision of  goods and services  to an  operation\nthat he knew might use the funds illegally.  See Direct Sales Co.\n                                                                 \nv. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 711, 713 (1943); United States v.\n                                                              \nFalcone, 109 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir.), aff'd, 311 U.S. 205 (1940).\n                                           \nThe  evidence,  as  we  discuss  below,  indicates  that  Granoff\nprovided  money  specifically for  the  purpose  of funding  down\npayments  he knew would be  falsified and was  promised $1000 per\nunit  for his efforts.  Granoff's provision of down payment funds\nwas  a specialized  transaction without  loan documents  or other\npaperwork and did not constitute merely the provision of goods or\nservices to the conspiracy.   Overall, the evidence is  more than\nadequate to support the finding that Granoff adopted the goals of\nthe  conspiracy as his own and provided the down payment funds to\nfurther the conspiracy.\n\n                               -35-\n\nin August of 1987, his partner, Gauvin, provided down payments to\n\nDean  Street on Granoff's behalf in the  form of checks that were\n\nnot  backed by  sufficient  funds.   Copies  of the  checks  were\n\nincluded in the closing  files.  The \"payments\" were  returned to\n\nGauvin  two days later  when Dean  Street wrote  identical checks\n\nback to Gauvin which Gauvin deposited in his account to cover the\n\noriginal down payment  checks.   The fact  that Gauvin's  checks,\n\ntotalling $246,000, were drawn  on an account with only  $6000 at\n\nthe  time  when they  were written  indicates  that there  was no\n\nintent on  Gauvin's part  to make an  actual down payment  in the\n\nfirst place.21\n\n          Granoff likewise provided down payment funds for  other\n\nbuyers  and  the evidence  indicates  he  did  this  knowing  and\n\nexpecting  that  the money  would be  returned  to him  after the\n\nclosing.   Granoff provided  $470,000 for  down  payments on  the\n\n                    \n\n21   Granoff argues that  with respect to  Count 2,  charging him\nwith bank fraud in connection with his purchase of a  unit at the\nCharlestown Motor  Inn, the  requisite knowledge element  was not\nestablished.   Brandon  had told  Granoff that  the down  payment\nwould be waived for  his purchase and there was  nothing, Granoff\nclaims,  in  the  closing  procedure sufficient  to  support  the\nconclusion that he knew his  purchase took place under fraudulent\npretenses.   On the contrary, even if we disregard the reasonable\npossibility  that  Granoff's  partner, Gauvin,  told  Granoff all\nabout the complex recycling transaction Gauvin undertook with the\nchecks used  for Granoff's  down payment,  the fact that  Granoff\nsigned the  HUD settlement sheets establishes  a sufficient basis\nto  conclude Granoff knew  he was  representing the  existence of\ndown  payments  that  he  was  not  actually  paying.    The  HUD\nsettlement sheet for Granoff's purchases clearly indicated that a\n$20,500 down  payment was  being paid  by the  buyer.   If indeed\nGranoff was under the impression, up to that point, that the down\npayment  had been  \"waived,\"  the $20,500  figure on  the closing\ndocuments  must have tipped him off that something suspicious was\ngoing on.\n\n                               -36-\n\nAtlantic  Inn-Westerly units in the  form of two  checks, one for\n\n$270,000 from Marvin Granoff Real Estate and another for $200,000\n\nfrom Granoff's  Eastern  Wire  Products  Co.   In  turn,  Brandon\n\npromised  to pay Granoff $1000 for each unit sold using Granoff's\n\ndown payment money.\n\n          As it turns out,  Granoff was never paid back,  but the\n\nevidence shows that Granoff expected and  intended for this money\n\nto be promptly  returned to him after the closings.   A recycling\n\narrangement had been used earlier for Granoff's own purchase, and\n\nfor  subsequent purchases  funded  by Gauvin,  under the  initial\n\nagreement  between   Granoff,   Gauvin,  and   Brandon.      More\n\nimportantly, about  two weeks after the  first closings involving\n\nGranoff's  $470,000,   Gauvin sent  a letter  to  Marderosian, on\n\nManchester   Associates22   letterhead,   complaining  that   the\n\ntransaction involving  the $470,000  was taking  too  long.   The\n\nletter stated  that the transaction involving  Granoff's $470,000\n\n\"was  to take  at  most two  to  three days.\"   Marderosian  also\n\ntestified that  on a different occasion,  Gauvin told Marderosian\n\nthat  Gauvin and Granoff \"can  make money without  putting up any\n\nmoney.\"    In addition,  there was  no  promissory note  or other\n\nformal  documentation to  indicate that  the $470,000  was normal\n\nloan  financing.23   Consequently,  Granoff knew  that his  money\n\n                    \n\n22    Manchester  Associates  was  a  partnership  formed  by and\nconsisting of Gauvin and Granoff.\n\n23  Gauvin and Granoff documented a previous  loan to Brandon for\nthe smaller  sum  of  $200,000  indicating that  if  they  really\nintended the money  to be a loan  instead of a tool  to show down\npayments  through  a  recycling   transaction,  they  would  have\n\n                               -37-\n\nwas used to create  the appearance that down payments  were being\n\npaid when in fact they were not; they were being falsified.\n\n          The  arrangement of  rapidly  recycling \"down  payment\"\n\nfunds  through  Dean Street  meant  that,  in  reality,  no  down\n\npayments were  being made at all.  A  paper trail was left in the\n\nclosing files indicating that  the buyer had made a  down payment\n\nto  the seller,  Dean  Street, when,  in  fact, the  seller  just\n\nreturned  the money  to  its source,  effectively rendering  that\n\npaper trail fraudulent.  Bay  Loan's down payment requirement was\n\nthus  avoided  without  the  bank's  knowledge.    As  a  knowing\n\nparticipant  in  this  recycling  scheme,  Granoff possessed  the\n\nnecessary  intent   to  defraud   and  the  requisite   level  of\n\ninvolvement  in the larger conspiracy  to be found  guilty of the\n\noffenses charged.\n\n          Although   not   essential   for  upholding   Granoff's\n\nconviction,  we also find that the evidence is sufficient to show\n\nthat  Granoff knew  Bay  Loan  was  loaning  the  money  for  the\n\ncondominium units.   Granoff  bought four  units financed  by Bay\n\nLoan and he put up nearly half a million dollars  to provide down\n\npayment  funds  for other  units to  be  purchased with  Bay Loan\n\nfinancing.    Homeowners  furnished  a  letter  at  the  closings\n\nincluding  the  closing  on Granoff's  purchases,  which  Granoff\n\nattended,  stating that  Homeowners had  \"transferred all  of its\n\n                    \n\ndocumented it.\n\n                               -38-\n\nrights and interests\"  in the  mortgage to Bay  Loan.24   Granoff\n\nhad occasion  to see  the letter  and it  is not unreasonably  to\n\nassume he also read it.\n\n          Granoff also  attended  a number  of planning  meetings\n\nwith Brandon in  which plans  for closing on  various units,  the\n\nfunding  of down payments, and  other details of  the scheme were\n\ndiscussed.   The evidence also indicates  Granoff was continually\n\nkept  abreast of various detail of Brandon's scheme; details, one\n\ncould infer,  that included the source of  the financing.  In the\n\nlast half of 1987, Granoff and Gauvin formed a partnership called\n\nManchester Associates for the  purpose of real estate investment.\n\nOn behalf of Manchester Associates, Gauvin met several times with\n\nBrandon  who discussed  his overall  plans to  close on  over 400\n\nmotel units as well as the schedule for  those closings.  Letters\n\nreferencing these meetings were  written on Manchester letterhead\n\nand one could reasonably infer that  Gauvin related the substance\n\nof  the meetings to his partner  Granoff.25  One such letter from\n\n                    \n\n24   There is  some dispute  whether this  letter, which was  not\nsigned  by the parties, was  included among the  documents at the\nclosings.  Homeowners' Vice  President, Gregory Cambio, testified\nthat  the letter  \"was  part of  the  closing package\"  but  also\ntestified  that it  may have  been sent after  the closing.   The\ntrial exhibits  containing the loan  files for each  of Granoff's\npurchases do contain  the letter which is dated on  the same date\nas  the  closing.    However,  the  file  contains  both  closing\ndocuments, signed by Granoff, as well as other documents that may\nor may not have been  at the closing.  The letter,  therefore, is\nnot  dispositive of  Granoff's knowledge,  but does  provide some\nevidence of  knowledge that can be considered in conjunction with\nthe other circumstantial evidence.\n\n25  For example, Granoff was cc'd on a letter to Dean Street that\nreferenced  plans  to  close  on  107  units  and  discussed  the\nrepayment of Granoff's $470,000.\n\n                               -39-\n\nGauvin states  that \"it would seem that  the lending institutions\n\nwill be in a position  to begin closing.\"  As Homeowners  and Bay\n\nLoan were the only  institutions involved at the time  the letter\n\nwas written,  the  plural reference  to \"institutions\"  indicates\n                                                     \n\nthat  Gauvin and  his partner,  Granoff, were  aware not  only of\n\nHomeowners but of Bay Loan as well.\n\n          In sum, the evidence  indicates that Granoff was aware,\n\non a fairly  detailed level, of a large real  estate scheme whose\n\nonly source of funding happened to be Bay Loan.  With substantial\n\nsums of his own money at stake in this extensive project, Granoff\n\nwas likely to become aware  at some point of the source  of money\n\nbehind  it all.  It  is not unreasonable  to conclude, therefore,\n\nthat Granoff knew of Bay Loan's involvement in the project.\n\n          Furthermore, the  fact that Bay Loan  was providing the\n\nfinancing  was known  to several  others who, like  Granoff, were\n\ninvolved in buying and investing in the units.  Brandon testified\n\nthat he was \"completely open\" about, and \"made no secret\" of, Bay\n\nLoan's involvement.  Although Brandon testified that he generally\n\ntold people outside  Dean Street that  the lender was  Homeowners\n\nand not Bay Loan, he also testified that he told  Hagopian, Ward,\n\nReisch, and Limoges about Bay Loan's involvement.   These people,\n\nlike Granoff,  bought units  or provided  down payment funds  and\n\nwere not Dean Street  employees.  Even an investor  named Michael\n\nParvin, who bought only one unit, testified that he knew Bay Loan\n\nwas involved.  It is  not unreasonable, therefore, for a jury  to\n\nconclude that Granoff discovered this fact as well.\n\n                               -40-\n\n          Granoff challenges any inferences of criminal knowledge\n\nor  intent drawn  from  the pool  of  circumstantial evidence  as\n\nimpermissibly based merely on  Granoff's association with his co-\n\ndefendants.  He  claims that amidst  the fast-paced wheeling  and\n\ndealing of the 1980s  real estate market, investors did  not have\n\nthe ability to know all the details and purposes behind every one\n\nof  their transactions.  It  was common for  investors to entrust\n\ntheir money to developers and lawyers without learning any of the\n\nspecifics of  the various projects  in which they  were involved.\n\nDetails  such  as  the exact  nature  of  a  bank's down  payment\n\nrequirement  were not,  Granoff implies,  important enough  to be\n\ndiscussed  between a  developer and  an investor.   Add  to these\n\ncircumstances the unscrupulous and  deceptive acts of Brandon and\n\nMarderosian, who allegedly got Granoff into this  whole mess, and\n\nGranoff  contends that we cannot help but conclude he was lied to\n\nabout the true nature of the project.\n\n          While it  may  be true  that  the typical  real  estate\n\ninvestor  in the 1980s would readily put up hundreds of thousands\n\nof dollars for  \"down payment funds,\" expect the money  back in a\n\nfew days, and still not  suspect he is defrauding a bank,  we are\n\ncertainly  not  prepared, given  the  facts  discussed above,  to\n\npreclude  a jury from concluding  otherwise.  The government need\n\nnot disprove  every reasonable hypothesis of  innocence, provided\n\nthe record in its  entirety supports the jury's verdict.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 714 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113 S.  Ct. 1005 (1993).   In this case, the  record does provide\n\n                               -41-\n\nthe   requisite  support.     Therefore,   we  affirm   Granoff's\n\nconvictions.\n\n                        2.  Charles Gauvin\n\n          Gauvin was  convicted of conspiracy and  five counts of\n\nbank fraud in connection  with his purchase of several  units and\n\nhis  funding of  buyer  down  payments.    Gauvin  was  Granoff's\n\nbusiness partner and the more active of the two in their dealings\n\nwith Dean Street.  According  to the record, he knew at  least as\n\nmuch  as Granoff,  and  most likely  more,  about the  scheme  to\n\ndefraud Bay Loan.   Gauvin also participated to a  greater extent\n\nin the scheme than  Granoff did.  Consequently, there is  no need\n\nto  discuss at  length  the evidence  sufficient  to support  his\n\nconviction.  \n\n          The jury could have found that Gauvin knew Bay Loan was\n\nproviding loans  for the  condominium project and  requiring down\n\npayments for these  loans based  on the evidence  of the  several\n\nmeetings  Gauvin  attended and  correspondence that  he exchanged\n\nwith   Brandon  discussing  the   condominium  projects  and  his\n\nagreement with Brandon to provide buyers with down payment  funds\n\nthat  were required  for the financing  of the  units.   The jury\n\ncould infer that Gauvin knew the  down payments were not in  fact\n\nbeing  paid  in violation  of  the bank's  requirement,  and that\n\nGauvin willfully  participated in  the scheme to  accomplish this\n\nfraud,  based on the evidence  that Gauvin: 1)  delivered to Dean\n\nStreet twelve  down payment  checks backed by  insufficient funds\n\nfor the  Charlestown  closings in  August  of 1987  and  received\n\n                               -42-\n\ntwelve  equivalent checks  back from Dean  Street two  days later\n\nwhich  he used  to cover  his original  checks; 2)  provided down\n\npayment money for  Reisch and  others which was  returned to  him\n\nwithin a matter  of days;  3) commented to  Marderosian that  the\n\ndown payment checks  he was providing \"did not have  to be backed\n\nby good  funds because the timing  was so quick\" and  that he and\n\nGranoff could \"make money  without putting up any money;\"  and 4)\n\ndelivered Granoff's $470,000 in down payment funds to Dean Street\n\nand wrote in a subsequent letter to Brandon that he  expected the\n\ntransaction involving those funds  \"to take at most two  to three\n\ndays.\"\n\n          Gauvin  argues  that  the  evidence  of  his activities\n\nclearly  indicates a lawful intent  in his writing  the checks to\n\nDean  Street.  As  he testified at  trial, Gauvin  thought he was\n\nsimply lending money to  Dean Street for its condominium  project\n\nand he  had no intention  that his  money be used  for fraudulent\n\npurposes.   Evidence in  the record indicates  that \"supplemental\n\nfinancing,\" similar  to what Gauvin  thought he was  providing to\n\nDean Street, was  a standard  practice in the  industry.   Gauvin\n\nalso  testified that he was  \"surprised\" to see  his first twelve\n\nchecks come back  so quickly.  But  Gauvin was not  so surprised,\n\napparently, so as to be tipped off that anything illegitimate was\n\ngoing  on because  such rapid  turn  around of  loans was  also a\n\nstandard  practice during  the  real estate  boom  of the  1980s.\n\nGauvin  suggests  that  maybe   Dean  Street  was  packaging  the\n\nsecondary financing and selling it off at a profit, thus removing\n\n                               -43-\n\nGauvin's participation as a lender fairly quickly. \n\n          Maybe, but then again, maybe  not.  The jury considered\n\nGauvin's arguments  and decided  that the evidence  proved Gauvin\n\nknew what was really happening at Dean Street.  Our job on appeal\n\nis to measure the sufficiency of  that evidence and not to search\n\nfor  every logical  or  rational conclusion  that  can be  drawn.\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 714.  Gauvin was told several times that funds\n     \n\nwere needed  to make down payments for buyers.  We find it rather\n\ndifficult,   therefore,  to   believe  Gauvin   thought  he   was\n\nlegitimately loaning  money for down payments  when the recipient\n\nof the payments  was giving the money  right back to the  lender.\n\nIf Gauvin loaned  money to a friend to buy a car and then had his\n\nloan paid off by  the car dealership, we  might wonder about  his\n\ncharacterization of the transaction as normal financing.   In the\n\npresent case, the suspicious nature of the transactions, combined\n\nwith  evidence  of  the  underlying  scheme  to  defraud  and  an\n\nagreement  between  Gauvin   and  the   scheme's  mastermind   to\n\ncontribute funds to the scheme, is more than ample to support the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n                        3.  Norman Reisch \n\n          Reisch was convicted of  conspiracy and seven counts of\n\nbank fraud.  The  evidence against Reisch indicates that  he knew\n\nBay Loan was financing  the condominium units, that he  knew down\n\npayments were  required for  the condominium  loans  and that  he\n\nknowingly  participated  in a  scheme  to  recycle funds  through\n\nbuyers to make  it look  like these down  payments were  actually\n\n                               -44-\n\nbeing  made.   Reisch  had \"at  least  a dozen\"  discussions with\n\nBrandon and  Marderosian about  the 20% down  payment requirement\n\nand ways that the \"requirement might be satisfied  by alternative\n\nmethods  or  might be  avoided,\"  including  the  use  of  second\n\nmortgages and loaning the down payment money to the buyers.\n\n          Proof   of  Reisch's   knowing  participation   in  the\n\nconspiracy is as follows.   Reisch bought four  Charlestown units\n\nfor which  Gauvin provided the down  payment funds.  At  the same\n\ntime, Reisch provided  another buyer with down  payment money for\n\nthree other units.   Dean Street returned the money to Reisch the\n\nnext day.   Reisch later agreed  with Brandon  to wire money  for\n\ndown payments directly into buyers' accounts.  After each closing\n\nthat utilized Reisch's  wired funds, the  down payment money  was\n\nreturned to Reisch.   On  some occasions, the  buyers' checks  to\n\nDean Street,  which were funded by Reisch, were endorsed directly\n\nback over to Reisch.  Reisch once remarked about this arrangement\n\n\"we  would just have to keep  bringing the funds back and rolling\n\nthem to wire more funds out for the projects.\"\n\n          As  for   Reisch's  knowledge  of   Bay  Loan,  Brandon\n\ntestified that it was  \"very probable\" that he told  Reisch about\n\nBay Loan's  involvement in the  project during a  conversation in\n\nthe  summer of  1988.   The jury  could reasonably  conclude that\n\nReisch had knowledge of Bay  Loan even before this  conversation.\n\nReisch's  contact with  Brandon and  his involvement in  the down\n\npayment  scheme  was  more  significant  than  that  of  Granoff.\n\nBecause we  found sufficient  evidence to support  the conclusion\n\n                               -45-\n\nthat Granoff had knowledge  of Bay Loan,  we think that, for  the\n\nreasons  discussed  above,  there  is  also  sufficient  evidence\n\nagainst Reisch. \n\n          Like Gauvin and Granoff, Reisch argues that he was just\n\nmaking  loans that he thought were completely legal.  Like Gauvin\n\nand Granoff, we find this argument unconvincing, especially given\n\nReisch's greater involvement in the scheme.  We reject, moreover,\n\nReisch's  application of the holding in United States v. Falcone,\n                                                                \n\n109 F.2d 579,  581 (2d Cir.  1940) (holding the mere  delivery of\n\ngoods or services to a conspiracy does not constitute  membership\n\nin the conspiracy), to  this case.  Reisch's conduct  amounted to\n\nmore than a mere delivery of loans to a conspiracy.  The evidence\n\nindicated  that Reisch was involved  in the planning  of the down\n\npayment  scheme and that  he played a key  role in furthering the\n\nsuccess  of a conspiracy that was starved for new funds before he\n\nbegan supplying them.  In particular,  Reisch provided a specific\n\nloan  arrangement (involving  a  complex system  of wired  funds)\n\nespecially tailored  to falsifying  the down payments.   Reisch's\n\nactions  thus were not limited  to the mere  provision of lending\n\nservices but instead were strong evidence of an intent to further\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n                       4.  Ronald Hagopian \n\n          Hagopian was convicted of  conspiracy and six counts of\n\nbank fraud for his role as a broker for Dean Street who solicited\n\n                               -46-\n\nbuyers and  facilitated their purchases.26   The evidence against\n\nHagopian more  than adequately  establishes his knowledge  of Bay\n\nLoan's down payment requirement  and his knowing participation in\n\nvarious schemes to fraudulently  represent the existence of those\n\ndown payments.   To begin  with, Brandon testified  that he  told\n\nHagopian  about   \"his  relationship\"   with   Bay  Loan,   which\n\nestablishes Hagopian's knowledge that  Bay Loan was providing the\n\nfinancing.  Hagopian  knew a  down payment was  required for  the\n\nunits by virtue of the fact that he provided a down payment check\n\nfor his own purchase, and he discussed down payments with some of\n\nthe buyers he recruited.27\n\n          Hagopian also knew about and participated in the scheme\n\nto  falsify  the  existence  of  the  down  payments.    Hagopian\n\npurchased  several condominium  units and  wrote  a corresponding\n\ndown payment check that  Dean Street never negotiated.   Hagopian\n\ntold the buyers he recruited that  they needed to write checks to\n\nDean Street for the purchases of their units but  that the checks\n\nwould  either not  be used  or would  be  covered by  Dean Street\n\nitself.28   Hagopian also told  some buyers that  they would have\n\n                    \n\n26    The court  entered a  mid-trial  judgment of  acquittal for\nHagopian on one count of bank fraud.  Hagopian was also found not\nguilty by the jury on two counts of bank fraud.\n\n27   In  addition, Hagopian's  business partner,  John Ward,  who\nrounded up buyers with Hagopian, told one of these buyers to give\nWard a check \"for the down payment that was required.\"\n\n28   In addition,  Hagopian was  present during  several meetings\nwith  Brandon including one where Brandon told a buyer that there\nwere no down  payments.  Hagopian  also told this  to the  buyer.\nThe buyer eventually  did produce  a down payment  check for  his\npurchase and  the  check  was never  negotiated.    Hagopian  was\n\n                               -47-\n\nsecond  mortgages to cover part  of their down  payment but these\n\nmortgages would later be  discharged.  All of these  schemes were\n\nactually  executed with  many of  the buyers  Hagopian solicited.\n\nSometimes Hagopian returned voided or nonnegotiated  down payment\n\nchecks back to the buyers.   Hagopian also told buyers they would\n\nbe paid  for each unit  they bought and he  usually provided this\n\nrebate money to the buyers he had solicited after the closings. \n\n          Hagopian  adds a new twist to the familiar refrain that\n\nhe  thought he was participating in a perfectly legal real estate\n\nproject.  He  claims that the fact he openly solicited buyers for\n\na  \"no money down\" investment  opportunity proves that  he had no\n\nknowledge that Brandon's down  payment scheme defrauded the bank.\n\nHagopian placed public  advertisements for the  condominiums that\n\nexplicitly  promised \"no  money  down.\"   Hagopian contends  that\n\nbecause Dean Street took  care of all the financing,  his job was\n\nlimited to soliciting buyers for a type of real estate investment\n\nthat  was allegedly  common  at that  time  and  not in  any  way\n\nsuspicious.29\n\n                    \n\nsubsequently  asked about that check by the buyer who expected it\nto  be returned  to him and  was concerned  it might  actually be\ncashed.  Hagopian said he would look into it.\n\n29   Hagopian makes a related  argument that his conduct  did not\nfurther the conspiracy to a significant degree and that there was\nnot  sufficient interdependence  between  Hagopian and  the other\nconspirators  to  establish  that  he joined  the  conspiracy  as\nrequired.   United States v. Evans  970 F.2d 663,  670 (10th Cir.\n                                  \n1992); United States  v. Horn,  946 F.2d 738,  740-41 (10th  Cir.\n                             \n1991).   All  that is  required is  that the  alleged conspirator\nfacilitate the  endeavors  of other  alleged  co-conspirators  or\nfacilitate the venture  as a whole.  See Evans,  970 F.2d at 670;\n                                              \nHorn 946 F.2d at 740-41.   The government has more than  met this\n    \nburden.\n\n                               -48-\n\n          The  evidence  clearly supports  the  jury's conclusion\n\nthat  Hagopian did  more than  innocently broker  deals for  Dean\n\nStreet.  Hagopian told  buyers of his \"no money  down\" investment\n\nopportunity  to provide  down payment  checks that  would  not be\n\ncashed  and  to sign  mortgages that  would  be discharged.   His\n\n\"openness\" in advertising no  money down investments simply shows\n\nhe was actively  soliciting buyers  to further the  scheme.   The\n\nscheme  relied  on  new  faces  to  serve  as  frontmen  for  the\n\nindividual  bank loans  and Hagopian's  actions were  an integral\n\npart of furthering the scheme's success.\n\n          Hagopian was  not open  about the  fact that  \"no money\n\ndown\"  meant providing  false paperwork  to the  bank so  that it\n\nwould  think down payments were  actually being made.  Regardless\n\nof whether 100% financing was customary at the  time and thus not\n\nsuspicious, the fake down payments and fake second mortgages were\n\ncertainly  not  customary (or  if customary  in the  1980s, still\n\nillegal),  and the jury was warranted in concluding that Hagopian\n\nknew this.   Finally, the  jury could reasonably  infer that  the\n\npublic advertising was just a necessary, and minor, risk taken by\n\nHagopian to  attract new  buyers and not  particularly convincing\n\nevidence of his innocence. \n\n                          5.  John Ward\n\n          Ward was convicted of conspiracy and six counts of bank\n\nfraud for purchasing a  unit and for soliciting and  facilitating\n\n                               -49-\n\nunit sales.30  The  evidence against Ward,  at least in terms  of\n\nknowledge and intent, is essentially the same as that against his\n\npartner,  Hagopian, and the two played  essentially the same role\n\nin the conspiracy.   Brandon  testified that he  told Ward  about\n\n\"his  relationship\"  with Bay  Loan.   Ward  also knew  that down\n\npayments were  required as he  was involved in  many of  the same\n\ndiscussions with potential buyers  that Hagopian was involved in.\n\nSpecifically, Ward  told one buyer to  give him a check  \"for the\n\ndown payment that was required.\"\n\n          Ward knew down payments were not actually being made as\n\nhis own down  payment was not negotiated  and he told one  buyer,\n\nwhose  down  payment funds  were to  be  wired into  that buyer's\n\naccount, that the down payment check would be cashed the same day\n\nso that the people wiring the funds \"got their money back.\"\n\n          We  reject Ward's  assertion that  he thought  Bay Loan\n\napproved  all of the various down payment shenanigans in which he\n\nwas  involved.  Ward  contends that the  down payment arrangement\n\nthat he was aware of was simply a paperwork requirement and not a\n\n\"real\" requirement; that  is, Ward  only knew that  some sort  of\n\npaper representing down payments had to exist but thought no real\n\nfunds  were actually required from the buyers.  We suppose Ward's\n\ncontention is within  the realm  of the possible.   However,  the\n\njury  looked at the  intricate down payment  arrangements and the\n\nway Ward explained them to the buyers and found, quite reasonably\n\n                    \n\n30   The district court entered a mid-trial judgment of acquittal\nin favor of Ward on one count of bank fraud.  The jury found Ward\nnot guilty on two additional counts of bank fraud.\n\n                               -50-\n\nwe  think,  that Ward  knew his  actions  were a  \"departure from\n\nfundamental  honesty.\"  Goldblatt, 813  F.2d at 624.   The common\n                                 \n\nsense understanding of a  down payment is the transfer  of actual\n\nfunds from  the buyer to the  seller or financier.   With this in\n\nmind, it  is more than reasonable for a  jury to find that once a\n\ndefendant  learned   of  the   structure  of  the   down  payment\n\narrangement  used  in  this  case,  with no  real  down  payments\n\nchanging hands, the  defendant would  be tipped off  to the  fact\n\nthat  a fraudulent  transaction  was contemplated.    Even if  we\n\nassume Brandon lied to Ward and  told him that Bay Loan  directed\n\nDean  Street to  arrange  for paper,  as  opposed to  real,  down\n\npayments,  the evidence was sufficient to  support a finding that\n\nWard knew he was engaging in a sham transaction.  \n\n          The evidence is also sufficient to prove Ward's willful\n\nparticipation in  the overall conspiracy and  Ward's execution of\n\nthe bank  fraud scheme  charged in  Counts 9,  15, 18,  and 19.31\n\nHowever,  the evidence is not  sufficient to show  that Ward took\n\nany actions  that would constitute  the engagement in  bank fraud\n\nset  forth  in Counts  24 and  25  of the  redacted indictment.32\n\nConsequently we uphold  the convictions on the  former counts and\n\nreverse the verdict against Ward on the latter two counts.\n\n                    \n\n31  Count 9 charges bank fraud in connection with Ward's purchase\nof a unit at the Bayside Motel.  Counts 15, 18 and 19 charge bank\nfraud  in relation to unit  purchases at the  Sandpiper Motel and\nthe Hillside Motel that were facilitated by John Ward and others.\n\n32  Counts 24 and 25 charged Ward and four  other defendants with\ndefrauding Bay Loan by obtaining an end loan for the purchases of\nunits  at the Sandcastle Motel by Bruce Schulbaum and John Mills,\nIII.\n\n                               -51-\n\n          As stated in Count 9, Ward bought a condominium unit at\n\nthe Bayside  Motel in October of 1987.  The down payment check he\n\nprovided  for the sale was never negotiated.  This is sufficient,\n\ngiven his  knowledge discussed  above, to support  the conclusion\n\nthat  Ward  never intended  to provide  real  funds for  the down\n\npayment  but   just  paperwork  to  deceive  the  bank.    Ward's\n\nconviction for bank fraud on Count 9 is thus upheld.  \n\n          The  evidence   is  also  sufficient  to   support  the\n\nconviction on  Counts 15, 18 and 19  which each charged Ward with\n\nbank fraud for  facilitating the sale  of a separate  condominium\n\nunit.   Ward  helped  to  solicit  the  buyers  involved  in  the\n\ntransactions for  these  counts  by  telling them  that  no  down\n\npayments  were  required.   He directed  one  of these  buyers to\n\nprovide down a payment check that would be funded by someone else\n\nand  then cashed  so  that the  funds  could be  returned.   Ward\n\nprovided the  buyers in Counts  15 and  18 with the  rebates they\n\nwere promised for purchasing units.  For the transaction in Count\n\n19, the evidence indicates that Ward was the intermediary for the\n\nfunds  wired  by  Brandon  to  cover  the  buyer's  down payment.\n\nBrandon's  wire transfer  was directed  to the  buyer's insurance\n\ncompany to the  attention of \"John Ward.\"  Thus, we uphold Ward's\n\nconvictions for conspiracy and on Counts 15, 18 and 19.\n\n          The evidence  is not sufficient, however,  to show that\n\nWard  engaged in bank fraud  with respect to  the transactions in\n\nCounts 24 and 25.  Although Ward was present at  the closings and\n\nseveral  of the  meetings  where down  payment arrangements  were\n\n                               -52-\n\ndiscussed for the sales in Counts 24 and 25, there is no evidence\n\nthat  Ward  said  anything  to these  particular  buyers  or  did\n\nanything  to otherwise  facilitate their  purchases.33   Ward did\n\nnot provide the  buyers in Counts  24 and 25  with rebates as  an\n\nincentive to buy nor did he  direct these buyers to falsify their\n\ndown  payments.34  As such,  Ward neither executed  nor aided the\n\nexecution  of  the  scheme to  defraud  in  these two  instances.\n\nBecause  we  see  no  evidence  in  the  record  to  support  any\n\nreasonable  finding  by  the jury  that  Ward  played  a role  in\n\nobtaining  the  loans  in  Counts  24  and  25,  we  reverse  his\n\nconvictions for these two counts.  \n\n                        6.  Owen Landman \n\n          Landman was  convicted of conspiracy and  six counts of\n\nbank  fraud in connection  with his facilitation  of down payment\n\narrangements  for  Dean  Street.35    Ample  evidence  exists  to\n\nsupport the finding that Landman knew  a down payment requirement\n\nexisted and  that he  knew about the  various fraudulent  methods\n\n                    \n\n33  Ward was involved in running the newspaper advertisement that\noriginally  attracted  the buyers  to  the  Dean Street  project.\nHowever,  that  act was  not  necessarily  directed toward  these\nspecific fraud counts and,  while contributing to the  fraud, was\nnot  alone  sufficient  to   constitute  an  affirmative  act  of\nfacilitation  of  the  fraudulent  loan  transactions charged  in\nCounts 24 and 25.\n\n34   We note that Hagopian,  who was also convicted  on these two\ncharges  and  whose conviction  we  are  upholding, did  actively\nsolicit the  buyers, discuss down payment  arrangements with them\n(such as dischargeable mortgages), and provide rebate money after\ntheir purchases.\n\n35   The  jury found  Landman not  guilty on  two counts  of bank\nfraud.\n\n                               -53-\n\nused to avoid that requirement.  As in Ward's case, however,  the\n\nevidence is  not sufficient to  show Landman participated  in the\n\nexecution of  a scheme to  defraud for four  out of the  six bank\n\nfraud counts.\n\n          Landman  acted as an escrow  agent for a  number of the\n\ncondominium  closings and  one of  his main  responsibilities was\n\nreceiving down payments from buyers and  transferring them to the\n\nseller,  Dean Street.  Marderosian testified that he told Landman\n\nthat  Gauvin and Granoff would  be funding down  payments for the\n\ninitial  purchasers and  Landman  should hold  that down  payment\n\nmoney.    Landman knew  that the  down  payment funds  were being\n\nreturned to  whoever provided  them as Landman  himself delivered\n\nthe money back to its source on several occasions.36   \n\n          Landman also knew about the fraudulent second mortgages\n\nthat were  supposed to cover part  of the down payment.   He knew\n\nthe buyers  were signing meaningless promissory  notes for second\n\nmortgages at the closings because Marderosian told him beforehand\n\nthat the mortgages would be discharged.  At the closings, several\n\nbuyers asked  Landman when  the  mortgages would  be released  as\n\npromised because the discharge  letter accomplishing this was not\n\npart of the closing  documents (presumably so Bay Loan  would not\n\n                    \n\n36   Marderosian explained to Landman that Reisch would be wiring\nmoney  directly into  buyers'  accounts  to  pay for  their  down\npayments and  that buyers  would then  write  checks to  Landman.\nLandman assured Reisch  that he would look after the  money.  The\nevidence  indicates that  with respect  to at  least some  of the\ntransactions, Landman returned the down payment funds that Reisch\nhad provided back to  Reisch, writing checks back to  Reisch from\nthe money Reisch had originally given to the buyers.\n\n                               -54-\n\nsee  the letter).    Landman made  gestures  to these  buyers  to\n\nindicate  that  they should  not talk  to  him about  it.37   All\n\nthese facts,  taken together, support the  jury's conclusion that\n\nLandman  knew that something illegal was being done to get around\n\nthe down payment requirement.\n\n          We reject Landman's argument that there is insufficient\n\nevidence  to prove he knew Bay Loan  was the target of the scheme\n\nto defraud.  To  begin with, Brandon was \"completely  open\" about\n\nBay  Loan's involvement and told  a number of  people involved in\n\nthe  scheme.  Several buyers  testified that they  knew about Bay\n\nLoan,  including  one  person  whose  only  involvement  was  his\n\npurchase  of a  single unit.   Landman  shared office  space with\n\nBrandon's  point   man  in  the  scheme,   Marderosian,  who  was\n\nintimately involved in all  the details of the scheme.   Finally,\n\nthe closing documents included  a letter indicating Bay Loan  was\n\nthe ultimate lender;38  Landman acted  as escrow  agent for  many\n\n                    \n\n37   At  one closing,  Kumalae \"asked  Owen if  he wanted  her to\naddress  [the  mortgage  discharge]  at the  time,\"  and  Landman\nresponded that  it \"had nothing  to do with  him . . .  he didn't\nwant to know  anything about it.\"  Another time  \"Mr. Landman did\nnot want to hear about it in front of us. I do recall him saying,\nhis  hands  saying not  in  front of  me.\"   Still  another buyer\ntestified  that  Landman  \"gestured\"  when  confronted  with  the\nmortgage discharge issue.  Landman argues that his  responses and\ngestures could  mean he just did  not know anything about  it and\ncould  not  answer  the  buyers'  inquiries.    We  find  that  a\nreasonable  jury  could  also  conclude  that  Landman's  actions\nindicated he already knew that something illegal was going on and\nwas trying to disassociate himself from it.\n\n38   As discussed in  footnote 24, Homeowners  furnished a letter\nstating that they transferred their rights in the mortgage to Bay\nLoan.   A  similar  document was  furnished for  the transactions\nbrokered by East  West.  Although the same  uncertainty regarding\nthe presence of the letter at the closings discussed in Granoff's\n\n                               -55-\n\nof the closings and also conducted a few of them himself.39\n\n          Sufficient  evidence  exists  to  support   the  jury's\n\nverdict on the conspiracy count and  on Counts 21 and 22.  Counts\n\n21  and 22 allege bank  fraud in connection  with the closings of\n\ntwo  units  at the  Hillside Motel.    The evidence  reveals that\n\nLandman  returned the  down payment  funds provided by  Reisch in\n\nconnection with these transactions back to Reisch in violation of\n\nthe down  payment requirement.40   In addition,  one Dean  Street\n\nemployee,  Marie Lynch,  testified  that, in  general, she  would\n\nbring  buyers' certified  down  payment checks  to Landman  after\n\nmoney was wired by  Reisch to the buyers' accounts  to accomplish\n\nthe certification.   Lynch testified  that she  once saw  Landman\n\nwrite a check to Reisch for the amount of the  down payment funds\n\nshe had  just  brought to  him.    Lynch did  not  specify  which\n\ntransactions she was referring to in her testimony but the record\n\ndoes  contain checks written by  Landman to Reisch  for the exact\n\namount of the down payment funds wired by Reisch for the Hillside\n\n                    \n\ncase above also  exists with  respect to Landman,  there is  more\nreason to  believe  Landman saw  and  read at  least one  of  the\nletters because Landman had greater exposure and familiarity with\nthe closing documents.\n\n39  Marderosian testified  that when he prepared Landman  for the\nclosings which  Landman conducted,  he \"explained  what documents\n[Marderosian]  would  be  preparing  and that  [Landman]  had  to\noversee their execution at the closing.\"\n\n40   That  evidence consists  of a  check written  by  Landman to\nReisch for the  exact amount of the funds which  Reisch had wired\ninto the buyers' accounts for the purchases in  Counts 21 and 22.\nAs discussed  above, at the time Landman  wrote the check, he had\nalready  been told what Reisch  was doing and  had agreed to look\nafter Reisch's money.\n\n                               -56-\n\npurchases referred to  in Counts 21 and 22.41   We therefore find\n\nthe evidence sufficient to support the convictions for bank fraud\n\ncharged in Counts 21 and 22.  This evidence is also sufficient to\n\nshow willful  participation in  the conspiracy and  thus supports\n\nLandman's conviction on Count 1.42\n\n          Landman argues  that his actions were just a normal and\n\nproper   function   of   his   job   as  escrow   agent.      His\n\nresponsibilities, he  claims, were strictly limited  to receiving\n\nand distributing  money at Dean  Street's direction.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Bruun, 809 F.2d 397, 402-03, 410 (7th Cir. 1987).  This\n               \n\n\"just following orders\" defense  cannot stand in the face  of the\n\nevidence  showing  that Landman  knew  down  payments were  being\n\nfalsified,  that he  agreed  to safeguard  Reisch's down  payment\n\nfunds, and  that  he personally  falsified two  down payments  by\n\nreturning  the funds to Reisch.   The evidence  was sufficient to\n\nindicate that Landman's intent was to participate in transactions\n\n                    \n\n41  Although the testimony that Landman \"[c]ut a check to Norman\"\nReisch  referred to a transaction  sometime in the  fall of 1988,\nroughly a month after the Hillside  closings in Counts 21 and 22,\nit  does  add  some  credence  to  the  government's  account  of\nLandman's involvement in the scheme to defraud.\n\n42   Landman  is wrong  in claiming  that the  jury impermissibly\nascribed  the illegal  actions of  Marderosian  to Landman.   Cf.\n                                                                \nUnited  States  v. Crocker,  788 F.2d  802,  806 (1st  Cir. 1986)\n                          \n(\"[A]scribing criminal liability to [an alleged] conspirator  for\na co-conspirator's acts by way of the adoption mechanism inherent\nin  a conspiracy requires that the imputed acts be in furtherance\nof  the conspiracy  or  that  they  fall  within  its  reasonably\nforeseeable  scope.\").   Returning  down payment  funds that  are\nrequired by the bank is not only within  the foreseeable scope of\nthe conspiracy but directly in furtherance of it.  The government\nthus  established Landman's  criminal conduct  independently from\nthat of Marderosian.\n\n                               -57-\n\ndesigned to deceive Bay Loan. \n\n          With  respect  to Counts  23  through  26, relating  to\n\nclosings  at the Sandcastle Motel,  no checks written  by, or to,\n\nLandman that involved down  payment funds were in evidence.   The\n\ngovernment  stipulated   that  the  relevant   checks  for  these\n\ntransactions  were forgeries.  In particular, Landman's signature\n\non  the  checks for  the Sandcastle  transactions were  forged by\n\nMarderosian.43   It is  true that Landman  conducted the closings\n\nfor the Sandcastle units  and thus in some sense  facilitated the\n\nscheme to defraud,44  but that  alone is not  sufficient to  show\n\nthat  Landman participated  in the  relevant act  of fraudulently\n\nviolating  the  down  payment  requirement  for  those individual\n\ntransactions.  On the  contrary, it seems that Landman  never saw\n\nthe down  payment  checks as  the money  did not  go through  his\n\nescrow account.  Instead, the checks were transferred directly to\n\nReisch.\n\n                    \n\n43    The existence  of forgeries  does  not, as  Landman claims,\nprovide conclusive  proof  of his  innocence on  all the  counts.\nJust  because his name was forged on  some of the checks does not\nnecessarily  imply that Landman  did not know of,  or agree to go\nalong with,  the conspiracy.  In other words, it is not true that\nthe forgeries could only indicate that  Marderosian was forced to\ngo behind  Landman's back to  accomplish the  scheme to  defraud.\nFor one,  Marderosian testified  that Landman authorized  some of\nthe forgeries  and indicated  that forging  Landman's name was  a\nmethod  of convenience rather than a way to hide illicit activity\nfrom  Landman.  More  importantly, Landman  did write  checks for\nillegal transactions  in Counts 21 and 22,  which, in conjunction\nwith  the  other  proof of  Landman's  knowledge  and  intent, is\nsufficient to uphold the conspiracy charge.\n\n44  Lynch's  testimony that Landman  wrote a check to  Reisch for\nthe   Sandcastle  units   is   decisively  contradicted   by  the\ngovernment's stipulation that the checks were forgeries.\n\n                               -58-\n\n          We note that Landman  also conducted closings for units\n\nat the Atlantic Inn-Narragansett,  but the jury acquitted Landman\n\non the charges connected to those transactions (Counts 16 and 17)\n\napparently because it  found the act  of conducting the  closings\n\nwas, by  itself,  insufficient to  establish the  execution of  a\n\nscheme to defraud.  For Counts 23 through 26, once the stipulated\n\nforgeries  are  removed  from consideration,  there  is similarly\n\nlittle  evidence to  support a  conviction  beyond the  fact that\n\nLandman conducted the  closings.  While  the jury is not  held to\n\nconsistent  results, we think that the acquittal on Counts 16 and\n\n17 reinforces our judgment that  (absent some confusion about the\n\nforged checks),45  there was insufficient evidence  to convict on\n\nCounts  23 through 26.   Because the evidence  is insufficient to\n\nprove  that Landman  executed or  aided in  the execution  of the\n\nschemes to defraud Bay  Loan charged in Counts 23  through 26, we\n\nreverse his conviction on those counts.\n\n                         7.  Momi Kumalae\n\n          Kumalae was convicted of conspiracy and three counts of\n\nbank fraud  in connection  with  various actions  she took  while\n\n                    \n\n45  There  was apparently some confusion surrounding the exhibits\ncontaining the forged checks.   The government agreed to  use the\nchecks  only against  the  other defendants,  namely Reisch,  but\nargued during  closing argument that Landman  was responsible for\nthe  checks written  to  Reisch on  the  Sandcastle units.    The\ngovernment  did  not explicitly  state  that  Landman signed  the\nforged checks; however, it  failed to acknowledge the stipulation\nof forgeries and  seemed to imply  no forgeries existed.   In any\nevent, we are  convinced that the jury improperly  considered the\nforged checks in their guilty finding on Counts 23 through 26.\n\n                               -59-\n\nworking  as  an  assistant to  Brandon  at  Dean  Street.46   The\n\nevidence  establishing Kumalae's  knowledge  of  Bay Loan's  down\n\npayment requirement and the scheme to fraudulently violate  it is\n\nthe  following:  (1) Brandon testified that he told Kumalae about\n\nhis  relationship  with  Bay  Loan,  (2)  an East  West  employee\n\ntestified that she asked Kumalae to forward information about the\n\nunit buyers so that she could  satisfy the guidelines established\n\nby  Bay  Loan;  (3)  Kumalae  was  present  during  some  of  the\n\nconversations  between Brandon,  Ward,  Hagopian and  a buyer  in\n\nwhich down payments were discussed; (4) Kumalae was also  present\n\nat a meeting  at which  Brandon said  \"they needed  to show  down\n\npayments or something  so they were going to  wire money into the\n\naccounts or deposit it and they needed one of our checks to prove\n\nthat it came out of our account\"; (5) Kumalae told one buyer that\n\nshe needed  a check  from him  and that she  would be  \"doing the\n\ntransactions at the banks\";  (6) Kumalae assured one  buyer whose\n\ndown payment check had not been negotiated that his check had not\n\nbeen  used;  and,  (7)  Kumalae instructed  another  Dean  Street\n\nemployee,  Marie Lynch, who had asked about the discharges of the\n\nsecond mortgages  that \"there weren't  supposed to be  any second\n\nmortgages  and to  just don't  worry about  it.  They  were being\n\ntaken care of.\"\n\n          The evidence  that she  willfully participated  in this\n\nscheme is as  follows: (1)  Kumalae advised buyers  of how  their\n\n                    \n\n46  The jury found Kumalae not guilty on one count of bank fraud.\n\n                               -60-\n\ndown  payment  requirement would  be  satisfied;47  (2) she  once\n\nwired  money from her own account to a buyer in order to fund his\n\ndown  payment;48   (3)  she   signed  several  of   the  mortgage\n\ndischarge  letters  provided  to   the  buyers;49  and,  (4)  she\n\nreceived  some of the down payment checks, and because several of\n\nthese checks  were  deposited  directly  into  Reisch's  account,\n\npresumably by Kumalae,  she effected the  return of down  payment\n\nfunds  to  their   source  in  violation  of  the   down  payment\n\nrequirement.   All  of  this evidence  is  sufficient to  support\n\nKumalae's bank fraud and conspiracy convictions.\n\n          Kumalae  attempts  to  rely  on cases  holding  that  a\n\ndefendant's  mere  presence at  the scene  of  the crime  or mere\n\nassociation  with criminals  to whom  all the  evidence  at trial\n\npertains is insufficient to  support a conviction for conspiracy.\n\nUnited  States v.  Ocampo, 964  F.2d 80  (1st Cir.  1992); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Mehtala, 578 F.2d 6,  10 (1st Cir. 1978); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Joiner, 429 F.2d 489, 493 (5th Cir. 1970).  Kumalae's reliance\n         \n\non these cases is misplaced  because the government's case rested\n\n                    \n\n47   Kumalae told one buyer \"no  down payments\" were required and\nthat  Brandon was a \"stand-up guy\" who would \"take care of things\nand not to worry.\"  On another occasion she told a buyer that his\nmortgage discharge \"would be taken care of after the closing.\"\n\n48   This was the basis for  the transaction for Count  15 and is\nsufficient to support her conviction on that count.\n\n49  One buyer  testifies that he picked  up his discharge  letter\nand the letter  of another  buyer directly from  Kumalae.   These\ndischarges  were made for the  transactions in Counts  24 and 25.\nWe  note that the jury  acquitted Kumalae on  Count 23 presumably\nbecause  there  was  no   such  testimony  to  support  Kumalae's\ninvolvement with the discharge.\n\n                               -61-\n\non Kumalae's own knowledge of the scheme to defraud based on  her\n\nown statements  to others  and on  a series  of actions taken  by\n\nKumalae  herself that  directly  defrauded Bay  Loan.   Kumalae's\n\nargument that she  was just  acting in good  faith by  performing\n\nministerial duties for Dean Street  and nothing more also  fails.\n\nThe  record is  clear that  Kumalae wired  down payment  funds to\n\nbuyers  from  her  own  account  and  signed  mortgage  discharge\n\nletters.  These actions were not merely \"ministerial duties.\"\n\n                          V.  SEVERANCE\n\n          The district court  denied the motions for  severance50\n\nmade by several  of the  defendants51 who argued  that they  were\n\nunfairly prejudiced  by the  evidentiary spillover from  the case\n\npresented   against  their  more  culpable  co-defendants.    The\n\ndefendants' claim is that the  joint trial seriously limited  the\n\njury's ability  to sift  through all  the  evidence against  each\n\nindividual defendant and increased  the risk that the  jury would\n\nbase  its verdicts on evidence which  has no bearing on the guilt\n\nor innocence of defendants with a more limited involvement in the\n\n                    \n\n50    The  rule  authorizing  motions  for  severance  states  in\npertinent part:\n\n            If  it appears that a defendant  . . . is\n            prejudiced   by  a  joinder   .  .  .  of\n            defendants . . .  for trial together, the\n            court  may .  .  . grant  a severance  of\n            defendants  or   provide  whatever  other\n            relief justice requires.\n\nFed.

Whatever the advisability, in general,  of holding mass\n\ntrials  in  complicated cases  with  many  defendants of  varying\n\nculpabilities,  we   do  not  find  any   significant  degree  of\n\nunfairness  or  prejudice in  this  case  that  would  warrant  a\n\nreversal of the district court's refusal to sever the trial. \n\n          The decision to grant or deny a motion for severance is\n\ncommitted to  the sound discretion of the trial court and we will\n\nreverse  its refusal  to sever  only upon  a finding  of manifest\n\nabuse of  discretion.

Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446,\n                                                 \n\n1452  (1st Cir.  1992),  cert. denied,  113  S.

See  Figueroa, 976  F.2d at  1452; United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 219 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n      \n\n          The  degree of prejudicial spillover appears minimal as\n\nno defendant  has demonstrated which, if  any, evidence presented\n\nat trial would have  been inadmissible if presented against  that\n\ndefendant  at  a  separate   trial.    The  government  presented\n\nsufficient  evidence to show that all defendants were involved in\n\na single  interdependent conspiracy, see Section  IX.B., and most\n                                        \n\nof  the  evidence at  trial was  related  to the  development and\n\noperation  of that  conspiracy.   \"Where  evidence featuring  one\n\ndefendant is  independently admissible against a codefendant, the\n\nlatter  cannot convincingly  complain  of  an improper  spillover\n\neffect.\"   O'Bryant,  No. 91-2132,  slip  op. at  10  (collecting\n                   \n\ncases).  Moreover, \"[e]ven  where large amounts of testimony  are\n\nirrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement\n\nin  an  overall agreement  is far  less  than the  involvement of\n\n                               -64-\n\nothers, we have been reluctant to secondguess severance denials.\"\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (citations omitted).  We therefore affirm\n      \n\nthe judge's decision to deny the severance motions.\n\n                     VI.  PRETRIAL PUBLICITY \n                     VI.  PRETRIAL PUBLICITY\n\n          On  January  1,  1990,  the Governor  of  Rhode  Island\n\nordered  the closure of credit unions  in that state insured by a\n\nprivate  entity  known  as   the  Rhode  Island  Savings  Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (RISDIC).  After years of risky real estate\n\ninvestments, many credit  unions were unable to  weather the late\n\n1980s crash in  the real estate market and RISDIC could not cover\n\ntheir anticipated losses.   In the process of closing  the credit\n\nunions, the governor froze the assets of hundreds of thousands of\n\nangry  depositors.  The ensuing panic among depositors as well as\n\nthe public  hearings, criminal investigations, and civil lawsuits\n\nreceived extensive media coverage.  The Rhode Island credit union\n\ncrisis, although  coexistent with Dean Street's  downfall, is not\n\nrelated to the present case.\n\n          Defendants  raised a  series of  claims related  to the\n\ndistrict  court's  alleged  failure   to  shield  them  from  the\n\nprejudicial effects  of publicity  surrounding  the Rhode  Island\n\ncredit union crisis.  They argue that their right to an impartial\n\njury  was jeopardized by the trial court's denial of their change\n\nof  venue motion, their  request for individual  voir dire, their\n\nrequest to question the  jurors about losing money in  the credit\n\nunion  crisis,  and  their request  for  a  mistrial or  curative\n\ninstructions after the admission  of certain evidence relating to\n\n                               -65-\n\nthe failed credit unions.   As we  find no significant threat  to\n\nthe trial's  fairness from the effects  of unfavorable publicity,\n\nwe uphold the district  court's denial of the motions  related to\n\nprejudicial publicity.\n\n                       A.  Change of Venue\n\n          The  decision to  grant a  change of venue52  is within\n\nthe sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewed for abuse\n\nof  discretion.   United  States v.

Change of venue is proper where  the level\n\nof  prejudice against a defendant precludes  a fair and impartial\n\ntrial  because  the  community  is  saturated  with  inflammatory\n\npublicity about the case.

R. Crim. P. 21(a).\n\n                               -66-\n\nfrom failed  financial institutions.  Defendants  claim that this\n\ndemonstrated widespread prejudice among potential  jurors against\n\nthem.  They argue that the jurors would  not distinguish Bay Loan\n\nfrom  the failed credit unions  and consequently the jurors would\n\ndirect their hostility toward those involved in  the credit union\n\ncrisis against the defendants at trial.\n\n          We find that  the publicity relating  to this case  did\n\nnot   particularly  saturate  the   community  with  inflammatory\n\nsentiment nor do we have any  reason to believe that the jury was\n\nanything but impartial.  The articles presented by the defendants\n\nevidence standard factual  press coverage of a  criminal case and\n\nare neither inflammatory nor sensational.  See Angiulo,  897 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 1181 (stating that  prejudice will not be presumed in the case\n\nof merely factual reporting, instead \"the publicity  must be both\n\nextensive and sensational in  nature\").  Only five of  the forty-\n             \n\nseven  prospective jurors had ever  read or heard  about the case\n\nand  none of them sat on the jury.  We find nothing in the record\n\nto indicate that the jurors' feelings about the credit crisis, if\n\nthey had any,  impaired their impartiality  in the present  case.\n\nThe trial judge  appropriately cautioned the jury  about the need\n\nto  separate the credit crisis  from this case  and, as discussed\n\nbelow, he  conducted a  voir dire that  sufficiently investigated\n\npossible  bias.  The trial judge determined that the jurors would\n\nunderstand  that the credit crisis had no connection to this case\n\nwhen he denied the change of venue motion and we find no abuse of\n\n                               -67-\n\ndiscretion in this conclusion.53\n\n                          B.  Voir Dire\n\n          Defendants argue  that the denial of  their request for\n\nindividual voir dire  and their  request for jurors  to be  asked\n\nwhether they  had  lost money  in the  credit unions  jeopardized\n\ntheir right  to an impartial jury.   See Irvin v.  Dowd, 366 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n717, 722  (1961).   Defendants claim  that as a  result of  these\n\nrulings the  court did  not adequately investigate  possible bias\n\nagainst defendants stemming  from the credit union  crisis.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., United States v. Gillis, 942 F.2d 707 (10th Cir. 1991). \n                             \n\n          The trial court has broad discretion in conducting voir\n\ndire.   United States  v. McCarthy, 961  F.2d 972, 976  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1992); Real v.  Hogan, 828 F.2d 58,  62 (1st Cir. 1987).   \"It is\n                     \n\nmore  than  enough  if the  court  covers  the  substance of  the\n\nappropriate  areas of concern by framing its own questions in its\n\nown words.\"  Hogan, 828 F.2d at 62 (citations omitted).   In this\n                  \n\ncase, the judge adequately probed prospective jurors for possible\n\nbias  related  to  the  credit union  crisis54  and  specifically\n\n                    \n\n53  We also reject the allegation of actual juror prejudice based\non  the unsubstantiated claim that there was a chance that actual\n                                                     \nprejudice existed which  could have  been revealed  if the  judge\nasked the right questions during voir dire.  As we find no errors\nin  the voir  dire  process,  see  subsection  B,  and  no  other\n                                 \nindication  of   actual  prejudice,   we  find   this  allegation\nunfounded.\n\n54  Specifically the judge told prospective jurors:\n\n            One thing I should  caution you about  is\n            some of  you may be aware  that there has\n            been  some  publicity  in   Rhode  Island\n            recently about the credit unions  and the\n            difficulties  that  they've  experienced,\n\n                               -68-\n\ninquired  several  times  whether  any  of  the  jurors  or their\n\nfamilies had  \"lost money  in a  bank fraud  or anything of  that\n\nsort.\"    One  juror   responded  affirmatively  to  the  court's\n\nquestions  in this area and  was excused.55   Throughout the voir\n\ndire, any juror responding to  the court's queries was  subjected\n\nto individual questioning by the judge and by counsel.  For these\n\nreasons, we find no errors in the voir dire process. \n\n                     C.  Prejudicial Evidence\n\n          During the trial, the  judge admitted evidence relating\n\nto some of the  failed credit unions and individuals  involved in\n\nthe credit  union crisis.  Specifically,  during the government's\n\ndirect  examination of  Marderosian  in which  he was  questioned\n\nabout  the use  of Bay  Loan funds  obtained from  the Sandcastle\n\nclosings,   Marderosian  explained   that,  in   accordance  with\n\nBrandon's  instructions,  he had  deliberately  failed  to pay  a\n\npreexisting  $1.5  million  mortgage  held by  the  Rhode  Island\n\n                    \n\n            and  I want  to  be  sure  that  everyone\n            understands that this case is not  in any\n            way related  to those  events.   Is there\n            anybody  who  thinks   they  would   have\n            difficulty in separating  this case  from\n            anything  you might have  heard about the\n            problems  credit  unions in  Rhode Island\n            have experienced?\n\n55  Defendants  make an additional  argument that because  jurors\nwere told  that the credit  crisis had no relation  to this case,\nthey  did not think losing  money in credit  unions was important\nbefore the trial started and thus would not have responded to the\njudge's comments  during voir dire.   Yet, once  evidence linking\ndefendants  to the  credit  crisis was  presented  at trial,  see\n                                                                 \nsubsection C, the issue  of losing money became critical  and the\nrisk of bias was no longer adequately addressed by the voir dire.\nThe  creativity  of   this  argument  is  matched  only   by  its\nimprobability and speculative nature.  We summarily reject it.\n\n                               -69-\n\nCentral Credit Union.  Instead, he used the loan proceeds to  pay\n\noff other Dean Street creditors.  Included in the lengthy list of\n\nthese  creditors admitted  at trial  were Robert  Barbato, Atrium\n\nFinancial, and Davisville  Credit Union.   All of these  entities\n\nand  individuals  were  involved   in  the  RISDIC  credit  union\n\ncrisis.56   Defendants objected to  the evidence and  moved for a\n\nmistrial  arguing that  the  evidence was  irrelevant and  highly\n\ninflammatory.\n\n          The decision to admit or exclude evidence under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 40357 is  committed to  the broad discretion  of the  trial\n\ncourt and we will reverse the court's judgment only rarely and in\n\nextraordinary  compelling   circumstances.

Rule 403 requires a balancing of the probative value\n\nof  a piece of evidence  against its prejudicial  effect.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

(Davisville  apparently  failed  despite  Dean Street's\npreferred  payment on its debt  with them).   Robert Barbato, who\npurportedly  was  connected  to  organized  crime,  was  a  heavy\nborrower of the  credit unions.

McMahon,\n                                                                \n\n938 F.2d at 1508.\n\n          The  admitted evidence  was  relevant to  the issue  of\n\nwhether Marderosian was stealing the  loan proceeds for Bay  Loan\n\nor  passing them  on  as  Brandon  directed.    Marderosian,  the\n\ngovernment's key witness,  was attacked  by the  defense and  the\n\nmedia as the main culprit in the scheme and the government sought\n\nto  bolster the  credibility  of his  testimony  by showing  that\n\nMarderosian  did not improperly divert  any of the  large sums of\n\nmoney that he  handled into his  own pocket.   The evidence  also\n\nhelped provide a foundation  for later expert testimony regarding\n\nwhat  happened to the funds obtained from  Bay Loan in the course\n\nof the scheme to defraud. \n\n          The relevancy  of the evidence  sufficiently outweighed\n\nthe  minimal  prejudicial effect  that was  created by  the brief\n\nmention  of individuals and  entities that were  connected to the\n\ncredit union crisis.  First  of all, nothing at trial  linked the\n\nnamed individuals  and entities  to  RISDIC or  the credit  union\n\ncrisis.   In order to find prejudice, the court would have had to\n\ninfer that the  jury had  heard of the  individuals and  entities\n\nfrom an external source and also knew of their involvement in the\n\ncredit  union scandal.58   Even  if  the jurors  did know  of the\n\ninvolvement  of  the  named   individuals  and  entities,  it  is\n\n                    \n\n58  The judge offered to question the jurors about their possible\nknowledge  of the  persons named  in  the disputed  testimony but\ndefense counsel refused.\n\n                               -71-\n\ndoubtful, given  the court's various cautioning  instructions and\n\nthe voir dire process, that jurors would likely be biased against\n\ndefendants just  because certain  names were mentioned  at trial.\n\nAt most, the jurors might conclude that defendants contributed to\n\nthe failure of at least one  credit union by not repaying certain\n\nloans.   The trial judge  asked the jurors, however,  if they had\n\nlost any money  from bank  fraud related schemes  and no  sitting\n\njurors said they had.  Thus we have no reason to believe that any\n\njuror who  may have inferred  that defendants contributed  to the\n\ncredit  union  crisis  would   be  particularly  likely  to  find\n\ndefendants  guilty  without  fairly  considering   the  evidence.\n\nFinally, to  the  extent  that  the balancing  of  relevance  and\n\nprejudice was a close  call, we find no  abuse of discretion  and\n\nuphold the trial court's admission of the disputed evidence.\n\n                   VII.  EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n          During  the  trial,  defendants  attempted  to  proffer\n\nevidence  regarding  the allegedly  common practice  by financial\n\ninstitutions  of  requiring  no  down  payment  on  the  sale  of\n\ncommercial  real   estate.    On   cross-examination  of  several\n\ngovernment  witnesses, Hagopian's  attorney asked whether  it was\n\ncustomary  during  the  relevant  time  period  to  buy and  sell\n\ncommercial  properties  with no  money  down and  to  obtain 100%\n\nfinancing.  The government objected on relevancy  grounds and the\n\ndistrict court  sustained the  objections.  On  another occasion,\n\nBrandon presented an expert witness, James  White, to bolster the\n\ncredibility of certain testimony.  Brandon had testified that Bay\n\n                               -72-\n\nLoan Vice  President Gormley  acknowledged that the  proposed end\n\nloans to  unit buyers actually constituted  one single commercial\n\nloan  to Dean  Street,  even though  they  were to  be  submitted\n\nindividually as  consumer residential  loans.  Brandon  sought to\n\npresent Mr. White's  opinion that  the loans at  issue were  more\n\nconsistent  with  commercial rather  than  consumer  loans.   The\n\ndistrict court again excluded the testimony on relevancy grounds.\n\nWe affirm the trial court's rulings.59\n\n          In general, \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible\" and\n\n\"[e]vidence  which is not relevant  is not admissible.\"   Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 402.   The district  court has broad  discretion in  making\n\nrelevancy determinations  and we  must review its  decisions only\n\nfor abuse of that discretion.  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n97,  101  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  484  US 844  (1987); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Lamberty, 778 F.2d 59, 61 (1st Cir. 1985).  Evidence is\n                  \n\nrelevant if  it has \"any  tendency to  make the existence  of any\n\nfact  that is of consequence  to the determination  of the action\n\nmore  probable  or less  probable than  it  would be  without the\n\nevidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 401; Lamberty, 778 F.2d at 61.  \n                                       \n\n          Defendants argue that the excluded evidence is relevant\n\nto one  of their theories of  the case: (1) either  that Bay Loan\n\nknew of and approved their falsification of down payments; or (2)\n\nthat defendants did  not know  about, or intend  to violate,  Bay\n\nLoan's  down  payment  requirement.     The  proffered  evidence,\n\n                    \n\n59  Because  we find the  disputed evidence was  not relevant  to\ndefendant's  case, we  also  reject Brandon's  argument that  the\ntrial court impaired his right to present his theory of defense.\n\n                               -73-\n\nhowever, does not make  either of these theories any  more likely\n\nto be true and thus the evidence is irrelevant.\n\n          As for the first theory, Brandon tried to show at trial\n\nthat  Bay Loan aggressively  purchased non-conforming loans, that\n\nhe openly sought 100% financing from  the bank, and that Bay Loan\n\nagreed  to  provide  the   financing  without  down  payments  by\n\ndirecting  Dean  Street  to falsify  the  paperwork  to show  the\n\nexistence of  down  payments.    The  expert  testimony  and  the\n\ngovernment witness's  testimony about  the common practice  of no\n\ndown  payment  financing  may  add  support  to  the  first   two\n\nassertions,  but those assertions are simply not at issue in this\n\ncase.  Rather, Bay Loan's alleged approval of false down payments\n\nis  at issue.  The defendants, however, have not demonstrated any\n\nrelationship between the proffered  evidence that no down payment\n\nfinancing  was a common practice and the likelihood that Bay Loan\n\ndirected  Dean Street  to falsify  paperwork to  misrepresent the\n\nexistence of down payments that were never made.\n\n          The  problem  with  defendants'  argument  is  that  no\n\nconnection between the common  use of 100% financing and  the use\n\nof  false down  payments was  ever established.60   That  is, for\n\n                    \n\n60   The same problem exists regarding the connection between the\nfake  down   payments  and   the  expert's   distinction  between\nresidential and commercial loans.  Brandon sought to characterize\nthe mortgages from Bay Loan as more like commercial than consumer\nloans  and  thus subject  to  different  standards and  policies.\nSpecifically, he  sought to show  that 100% financing  was normal\nfor  commercial  loans  and  to counter  the  allegedly  critical\ncontention   that  residential   loans  typically   require  down\npayments.  This  is basically the  same type of  evidence as  the\ntestimony  that 100%  financing  was customary  in the  industry.\nThat  is, a  showing that  Bay Loan's  mortgages  were commercial\n\n                               -74-\n\nthe evidence to be relevant, there must be some reason to believe\n\nthat 100% financing, or no down payment financing, is customarily\n\nprovided  in  conjunction   with  paperwork  showing  fake   down\n\npayments.   A no down  payment custom does  not establish a  fake\n\ndown  payment  custom.    The  defendants  lack,  therefore,  any\n\nfoundation that would make the proffered evidence relevant.\n\n          \"'Trial judges have wide discretion in deciding whether\n\nan adequate  foundation  has  been  laid  for  the  admission  of\n\nevidence.'\"    Veranda Beach  Club  Ltd.

Even if\n\nwe  accept 100%  financing was  in fact  generally common  in the\n\nindustry and  for Bay Loan,  it does not  follow that Bay  Loan's\n\napproval of false down  payment transactions is any  more likely.\n\nDefendants  must provide,  for  example, some  evidence that  the\n\nrecording  of down payments in no down payment transactions was a\n\ncommon  formality, perhaps  for  accounting, tax  or  bookkeeping\n\n                    \n\nhelps  to establish the  likelihood that the  loans were actually\n\"no  down payment  loans.\"   This  still  leaves us  without  the\nmissing foundational  link -- that  no down payment  financing is\nsomehow associated with falsified down payments.\n\n   In response  to Brandon's claim that the government proved its\ncase  by showing the transactions deviated from the norm, we note\nthat the relevant norm is  not 100% versus 80% financing but  the\nstandard method  of representing down payments,  or lack thereof,\nin loan transactions.  Proof  of a no down payment norm  does not\nestablish a fake down payment norm.\n\n                               -75-\n\npurposes,61  or for  the  convenience of  some interested  party.\n\nIf  such evidence  existed,  then maybe  a sufficient  foundation\n\nwould exist for  the relevance  of 100% financing.   However,  no\n\nsuch foundation is evident in the record.\n\n          What defendants were really trying to show  is that the\n\nbank or its officials  were themselves perpetrating some sort  of\n\nfraud and  the defendants were unwittingly caught up in it.  This\n\nassertion,  however,  also  lacks   foundational  support.    The\n\ndefendants want the proffered evidence to establish that Bay Loan\n\nwas in the practice  of providing 100% financing and  thus likely\n\nto be providing 100%  financing in this case as  well, regardless\n\nof whether such financing  involved fake down payments, kickbacks\n\nor fraudulent paperwork.  This formulation, however, obscures the\n\nreal issue: if Bay Loan intended to provide 100% financing, or if\n\ndefendants thought down payments  were waived, why did they  have\n\nto  take actions  to  falsify down  payments?   To  satisfy  this\n\nrequisite  foundational  question,  the  defendants had  to  show\n\neither  that,  (1)  officials at  Bay  Loan  stood  to reap  some\n\npersonal  gain  by  offering  loans  with  no  down  payments  in\n\nviolation of the  bank's requirements and thus  needed to falsify\n\n                    \n\n61   Brandon claims that  Bay Loan  directed him to  falsify down\npayments so that the  bank could package the commercial  loans as\nresidential  loans.  Were his  claim true, however,  it would not\nmake the common practice of  providing commercial loans, and  the\n100% financing such loans allegedly involve, any more relevant to\nthe  issue  of  why   the  falsification  of  down  payments   is\njustifiable.   Still lacking is  some indication that  the common\npractice of lending  money without  down payments  makes it  more\nlikely  that the bank would find  it necessary to mischaracterize\nloans and consequently  direct Dean Street to produce  false down\npayment paperwork.\n\n                               -76-\n\ndown payments to hide  the violation from bank superiors;  or (2)\n\nthe bank  as a whole  stood to  reap some gain  by lending  money\n\nunder  false  pretenses,  perhaps  to  deceive  their  creditors,\n\nshareholders,  or regulators.62  In  the absence of some evidence\n\nsupporting these  two propositions, the custom  of 100% financing\n\nor  the characterization of the loans as commercial as opposed to\n\nresidential does not make Bay Loan's  approval of fraudulent down\n\npayments any more  likely to  be true.   Again, the  foundational\n\nlink is simply missing.\n\n          The   excluded  evidence  is  similarly  irrelevant  to\n\ndefendants'  lack of  knowledge or  intent to  defraud Bay  Loan.\n\nDefendants claim that evidence that 100% financing was a standard\n\npractice supports their claim  that they did not know  or suspect\n\nanything was unusual or illegal about the  loan transactions they\n\nparticipated in.   Again, what  is at issue  is the existence  of\n\nfalsified  down payments.   There  is no  basis for  finding that\n\ndefendants  were  more likely  to  think  that  their actions  to\n\nfacilitate  the documentation of  nonexistent down  payments were\n\nsomehow legitimate just because 100% financing was customary.  To\n\nput  it another  way, the  proffered evidence  does not  make the\n\nfalse  down  payment  maneuvers  less  likely  to  tip   off  the\n\ndefendants to the  illegal nature of the transaction without some\n\nfoundation  connecting 100%  financing to  creative down  payment\n\n                    \n\n62   Defendants presented  evidence that  Bay Loan  was knowingly\nlending in violation  of other requirements  it imposed, not  the\nleast  of which  was  the requirement  that  buyers live  in  the\ncondominiums they purchased which  was impossible given the units\nwere to be operated as motels.\n\n                               -77-\n\npaperwork  of some  kind.   Defendants were  not engaged  in what\n\nappeared to them to be a \"no down payment transaction\"; they were\n\ndoing  what appeared to  them to be  a transaction  where a paper\n\ndown  payment was documented and  recorded but not actually paid.\n\nThe no  down payment custom would  only be relevant to  intent if\n\nthat custom  involved something even vaguely similar to this sort\n\nof paper  down payment.  Because no such foundation exists on the\n\nrecord, and because we find no abuse of discretion on the part of\n\nthe trial court in refusing to  allow the jury to assume or infer\n\nthat  foundation,  we  uphold  the  exclusion  of  the  proffered\n\nevidence.63\n\n  VIII.  PREJUDICE FROM COMMENTS REGARDING DEFENDANTS' ETHNICITY\n\n          During the  fifth day  of trial, the  government's main\n\nwitness, Marderosian, testified about a comment made by defendant\n\nLandman concerning the religious affinity between Landman and co-\n\ndefendant  Reisch.     Marderosian   was  describing   on  direct\n\nexamination the arrangement for Reisch to wire down payment money\n\ninto buyers' accounts.  The arrangement was designed, in part, to\n\nallay Reisch's  concern that too much money  would be outstanding\n\nbetween the time he provided funds to the buyers and the time the\n\nfunds were  returned to him  by Dean Street.   In reference  to a\n\n                    \n\n63  Unlike  the cases cited  by defendant that  have held that  a\ncertain custom or practice  in an industry may be relevant to the\ndefendant's case, United States v.

The judge denied the motion and also denied\n\nlater  defense motions for a mistrial.  Defendants argue that the\n\ntestimony invited  the jury  to make the  impermissible inference\n\nthat members of the same  religion would be more likely to  trust\n\neach other and join  in a conspiracy and also  that the testimony\n\nmay  have  provoked anti-Semitic  feelings  among  jurors.   When\n\ndefendants first  raised their objections, the  trial judge asked\n\ncounsel what they  wanted him to do and the  judge offered to try\n\nand ferret out any possible anti-Semitism on the jury.  Counsel's\n\nonly  request was for dismissal.  Counsel did not request further\n\nquestioning of the jury on this matter and  expressed displeasure\n\n                    \n\n64   Marderosian's testimony  about Landman's  statement properly\nfalls  under the  co-conspirator exception  to the  hearsay rule,\nFed.  R.  Evid.   801(d)(2)(E),  because  the  evidence   clearly\nestablishes  beyond   a  preponderance   of  the  evidence   that\nMarderosian,  Landman   and  Reisch  were  all   members  of  the\nconspiracy and the statement was made during the course of and in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  See United States v. Angiulo, 897\n                                                            \nF.2d 1169, 1201-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990).\n                                           \n\n                               -79-\n\nwith the  possibility of providing curative  instructions because\n\n\"instructions would only magnify the problem.\"\n\n          Under  these circumstances,  we do  not think  that the\n\ntrial court's  actions  constitute reversible  error despite  the\n\npossible  inappropriateness  of  the  testimony.   The  level  of\n\nprejudice, if  any, was not sufficiently  significant to overturn\n\nthe judge's decision to accept the defendants' tactical choice to\n\nforgo  more  appropriate  methods  of  addressing  the  potential\n\nprejudice in favor of the unrealistic and unnecessary solution of\n\na dismissal or a new trial.  Cf. United States v. De La Cruz, 902\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  121, 124  (1st Cir.  1990) (noting  the reluctance  of this\n\ncourt  to require  trial judges  to override  plausible strategic\n\nchoices  on the  part  of counsel  in  the context  of  remedying\n\npotential prejudice); United States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 505\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1067 (1978) (refusing to\n                              \n\nreverse verdict in trial  with prejudicial references to religion\n\nbecause the trial judge gave curative instructions).\n\n          The  prejudicial  effect  of   Marderosian's  statement\n\nappears quite limited.  The reference to defendants' Judaism  was\n\nthe only such mention of  religion at trial.  It amounted  to one\n\nbrief sentence in nineteen days of testimony and argument.  There\n\nwas  no subsequent reference to  the challenged testimony nor did\n\nthe government use the issue of religious affinity in its closing\n\nargument.  The inference of Jewish affinity was not, as defendant\n\nLandman claims, central to  the government's case.  The  basis of\n\nLandman's  agreement to participate in the conspiracy was not his\n\n                               -80-\n\npromise to protect the interests of Reisch but his agreement with\n\nMarderosian and Brandon to facilitate the unit sales without down\n\npayments.   As discussed above,  see Section  IV.B.6, the  record\n                                    \n\ncontains  sufficient  facts   regarding  Landman's  actions   and\n\nstatements  made by,  and to,  him to  support his  knowledge and\n\nparticipation  in  the  conspiracy.   None  of  these  facts have\n\nanything to  do with  Landman's supposed religious  affinity with\n\nReisch.65 Likewise,  the evidence  against Reisch  centers around\n\nhis agreement with Brandon to provide money to the scheme and not\n\naround  his  relationship with  Landman.   In  fact,  Landman was\n\nacquitted by the jury on two bank  fraud counts that involved the\n\nfunding of down payments by Reisch in which Landman conducted the\n\nclosings. This indicates that the jury was not prejudiced and did\n\nnot rely on the disputed testimony in its verdict.  \n\n          Nothing  like  the  serious  prejudicial  circumstances\n\nfound in United  States v.  Rodr guez Cort s, 949  F.2d 532  (1st\n                                            \n\nCir. 1991) (finding reversible error  from ethnically prejudicial\n\nevidence),  exists  in  this  case.   In  Rodr guez  Cort s,  the\n                                                           \n\ndistrict court  had found a  defendant's Colombian identification\n\ncard  admissible  based  on  the  impermissible  assumption  that\n\nColombians  were more  willing  to trust  fellow Colombians  than\n\nanyone  else, and therefore, defendant  was likely to be involved\n\n                    \n\n65   There  is also  sufficient testimony,  quite apart  from the\ndisputed  comment, that  Landman  agreed to  look after  Reisch's\ninterests.   Marderosian testified that Reisch  told Landman that\n\"he  wanted Mr. Landman  to look out for  his interest to protect\nhis   money  to  the  extent  possible.\"     Landman  later  told\nMarderosian \"he would  try to  protect Mr. Reisch  to the  extent\npossible.\"\n\n                               -81-\n\nwith his Colombian co-defendants.   Id. at 540.   This connection\n                                      \n\nwas emphasized in the government's closing argument.  Id. at 541.\n                                                        \n\nHere, there  was no objection  to the relevancy  of Marderosian's\n\nstatement and thus no ruling based on an impermissible inference.\n\nThe judge recognized the potential  for prejudice and offered  to\n\ntake  steps to  rectify  the  problem.    More  importantly,  the\n\ngovernment  did  not invoke  any  inferences  based on  religious\n\naffinity in  its  final argument  before  the jury.    Similarly,\n\nUnited States v.  Cruz, 981 F.2d  659 (2d Cir. 1992),  and United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Doe, 903 F.2d 16 (D.C. Cir. 1990), are distinguishable\n              \n\nfrom  the   present  case   because  those  cases   involved  the\n\ngovernment's explicit  use of the  impermissible reasoning,  upon\n\nextensive direct examination and  on summation, for crucial parts\n\nof its theory of the case.\n\n          Defendants   suggest   there    was   an   element   of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct in eliciting the disputed testimony from\n\nMarderosian.   Marderosian  had  made a  similar statement  about\n\ndefendants' Judaism when  he testified before the  grand jury and\n\nthe pattern  of questioning  prior to Marderosian's  statement at\n\ntrial  could  be  construed as  an  attempt  to  elicit the  same\n\ntestimony from him a second time.   At the bench conference  with\n\nthe  judge,   the  prosecutor  denied  knowing   beforehand  that\n\nMarderosian would make the comment about defendants' religion and\n\nclaimed to  have instructed Marderosian to limit his testimony to\n\nthe  fact  that Landman  said  Reisch felt  comfortable  with the\n\narrangement.  While the  circumstances are somewhat troubling, we\n\n                               -82-\n\ndo not  find sufficient  evidence of prosecutorial  misconduct to\n\nreverse the verdicts  in this  case, especially in  light of  the\n\nabsence  of  any  reference  to  the  religious  comment  in  the\n\ngovernment's  summation.   Compare  Goldman  563  F.2d at  504-05\n                                           \n\n(prosecutor, on summation, referred to fact defendant was wearing\n\n\"what  they call in the Jewish  religion a yamaka [sic]\" and that\n\nthe  symbol  he  was  wearing  \"has  been  defamed,  defiled  and\n\nscandalized\"). \n\n                      IX.  JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n          Defendants   make  three   challenges   to   the   jury\n\ninstructions  in this case.66   They allege that  the trial judge\n\nfailed to provide proffered instructions concerning the  required\n\nproof of intent  for conspiracy and  the possibility of  multiple\n\nconspiracies.  They also argue that it was error for the judge to\n\ngive an instruction concerning willful blindness.\n\n                    \n\n66  Defendant Granoff makes an additional argument that the trial\njudge erroneously failed to instruct the jury that they must find\nthat defendants knew  of Bay Loan's federally  insured status and\nthat defendants knew  Bay Loan  was the target  of the scheme  to\ndefraud.   Because we found  that neither of  these elements were\nrequired for a conviction under the bank fraud statute, see supra\n                                                                 \nSection IV, the trial court  did not err in refusing to  give the\nproffered instructions.\n\n   The trial judge was thus correct in instructing the jury that:\n\n            it is not necessary for the Government to\n            prove   that   the  Defendant   knew  the\n            identity  of   the  particular  financial\n            institution  or  that the  Defendant knew\n            that   that  institution   was  Federally\n            chartered  or insured.  . .  .   It must,\n            however,   prove   that   the   Defendant\n            intended    to   defraud    a   financial\n            institution.\n\n                               -83-\n\n           A.  The Direct Sales Conspiracy Instruction\n                               \n\n          The defendants  proffered  a jury  instruction67  based\n\non the rule derived from  Direct Sales Co. v. United States,  319\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 703, 711, 713 (1943), that one who supplies goods to another\n\nknowing that the recipient  will use them for an  illegal purpose\n\ncannot, on that basis  alone, be found guilty of  conspiring with\n\nthe recipient.   Rather, for the  supplier to be  culpable, he or\n\nshe  must have the intent  to further, promote,  and cooperate in\n\nthat  illegal purpose.  Id.;  United States v.  Falcone, 109 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n579, 581 (2d  Cir.), aff'd., 311 U.S.  205 (1940).   The district\n                          \n\ncourt  did not  give  the defendants'  proffered instruction  but\n\ninstead instructed the jury that \"to be a member of a conspiracy,\n\na Defendant must have  willfully joined it or participated  in it\n\n                    \n\n67  The instruction stated, in pertinent part:\n\n            You are instructed that  a person who may\n            have furnished goods,  money or  services\n            to another person who he knows is or will\n            be  engaged in  criminal activity  .  . .\n            does not by  furnishing such goods, money\n            or services necessarily  become a  member\n            of the  conspiracy.   Instead, . .  . the\n            government must show beyond  a reasonable\n            doubt that the defendant was aware of the\n            conspiracy and  knowingly and voluntarily\n            joined it  with the intent  of furthering\n            its illegal aims.\n\n            To reiterate,  it is not  enough that the\n            Government   prove   that  a   particular\n            defendant acted in  a way that  furthered\n            the   purposes   or  objectives   of  the\n            conspiracy.  Instead the  Government must\n            prove  beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n            defendant  acted  while  knowing  of  the\n            unlawful agreement and with the intention\n            to participate in it.\n\n                               -84-\n\nfor  the   purpose  of  advancing  or   furthering  its  unlawful\n\npurposes.\"   The court also stated that the government must prove\n\neach defendant's \"intent to  participate in the unlawful scheme.\"\n\nDefendants argue that this instruction inadequately addressed the\n\nintent requirement laid out in Direct Sales and Falcone.\n                                                       \n\n          The   trial  court's   failure  to  give   a  proffered\n\ninstruction will not be  reversed unless that instruction  is (1)\n\nsubstantively correct;  (2) was not substantially  covered in the\n\ncharge actually given; and (3)  concerned an important point such\n\nthat the failure to give it seriously undermined the  defendant's\n\nability  to  present a  particular  defense.   United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nMcGill,  953  F.2d  10, 13  (1st  Cir.  1992);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nPerkins, 926  F.2d 1271,  1283 (1st  Cir. 1991).   In this  case,\n       \n\ndefendants fail to get past the second prong of the test.\n\n          The district  court's instruction, which states  that a\n\ndefendant must have \"the purpose of  advancing or furthering\" the\n\nunlawful  purpose  of the  conspiracy,  substantially  covers the\n\nsubstance of  defendant's proffered instruction.   The judge also\n\ninformed the jury  that defendant had  to \"willfully join[]\"  the\n\nconspiracy, that defendant had  to have both the intent  to agree\n\nto join the  conspiracy and  the specific intent  to commit  bank\n\nfraud, and that defendant  had to have the intent  to participate\n\nin  the unlawful scheme.  All of these instructions together more\n\nthan  adequately address  the  requirements of  Direct Sales  and\n                                                            \n\nFalcone that defendant must join the conspiracy with the specific\n       \n\nintent to accomplish its  illegal purpose.  See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\n                               -85-\n\nArias-Santana, 964 F.2d  1262, 1268 (1st  Cir. 1992) (finding  no\n             \n\nerror  where jury  charge  covered the  substance of  defendant's\n\nrequests); McGill, 953 F.2d at 12-13 (same).   We have upheld the\n                 \n\nadequacy  of  nearly identical  instructions  in the  past.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d 18, 37-38 (1st Cir. 1983).\n                       \n\n          The defendants focus on  the fact that the trial  judge\n\ndid not explicitly  state that  mere knowledge  by the  defendant\n\nthat the  goods he or she  provides to a conspiracy  will be used\n\nillegally  is not  sufficient  to prove  an  intent to  join  the\n\nconspiracy.  This instruction, defendants allege, is necessary to\n\nproperly define  \"intent to  participate\" or  \"intent to  join\" a\n\nconspiracy.   Without an expression  of the  innocent case,  they\n\nadd,  the instructions leave open  the door for the impermissible\n\ninference that a defendant can be guilty of conspiring to defraud\n\nBay  Loan simply  by providing  money to  Dean Street  knowing it\n\nwould be used illegally.  Defendants claim that because the murky\n\ndistinction between lawful cooperation and  illegal participation\n\nis  especially close  in  this case,  the  district court  had  a\n\nspecial obligation to be clear.\n\n          In  some  situations, this  type  of \"negative\"  Direct\n                                                                 \n\nSales  instruction might be required,  but we see  nothing in the\n     \n\nfacts  of this  case that  makes the  distinction  between simply\n\nknowing  of  the illegal  nature of  the  scheme and  agreeing to\n\nfurther the  scheme particularly  crucial to  the  defense.   The\n\ncentral defense of  most defendants  was that they  did not  know\n\nthat  Dean Street  was doing  anything  illegal in  obtaining the\n\n                               -86-\n\nloans.  Once knowledge of illegality is established, the evidence\n\nof  defendants' participation,  as  opposed  to merely  providing\n\ngoods and services to the conspiracy, is overwhelming and not, as\n\ndefendants assert, a close call.  See supra Section IV.\n                                           \n\n          In any  event, we think the  trial court's instructions\n\nwere  quite clear  that  (1) \"[i]n  order  to be  a  member of  a\n\nconspiracy,  a  Defendant  must   have  willfully  joined  it  or\n\nparticipated in it for the purpose of advancing or furthering its\n\nunlawful  purpose\"; and  (2)  that defendant  must  have both  an\n\nintent to agree to join the conspiracy and the specific intent to\n\ncommit  bank fraud.   These  instructions adequately  defined the\n\nrequisite \"intent  to participate\" and  foreclosed any  inference\n\nthat knowingly providing goods to a criminal enterprise is itself\n\nsufficient to support a finding of intent to join the conspiracy.\n\nThe  trial  court need  not employ  the  most elegant  or concise\n\nphraseology  nor  must it  incorporate  the  precise language  of\n\ndefendants'  request as long as the instructions taken as a whole\n\n\"accurately  communicated  the  meat  of  the defense's  theory.\"\n\nMcGill,  953 F.2d at 12.  In this case,  the court's instructions\n      \n\nadequately   communicated  the   defendants'  theory   that  mere\n\nknowledge  and  assistance,  without  an intent  to  further  the\n\nenterprise, is not enough. \n\n             B.  Instruction On Multiple Conspiracies\n\n          The defendants also challenge the trial court's refusal\n\nto  instruct  the  jury   as  to  the  possibility   of  multiple\n\n                               -87-\n\nconspiracies.68   Such an instruction was  warranted, they claim,\n\nbecause  the evidence  indicated  that  different defendants  had\n\ndifferent  relationships with  Dean Street  and were  involved in\n\nseparate  schemes.  Although the judge may have erred in refusing\n\nto charge  multiple conspiracies, we  find insufficient prejudice\n\nto warrant a reversal of the convictions.\n\n          A trial court should grant a  defendant's request for a\n\nmultiple conspiracy  instruction if, \"on the  evidence adduced at\n\ntrial,  a reasonable jury could  find more than  one such illicit\n\nagreement, or  could find  an  agreement different  from the  one\n\ncharged.\"  United States  v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 243  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990); see also United States v. Dennis, 917 F.2d 1031, 1033 (7th\n                                       \n\nCir. 1990); United States  v. Dwyer, 843 F.2d 60, 61-62 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1988).   As it  is highly likely that  the voluminous and complex\n\nrecord  in this case, viewed  in the light  most favorable to the\n\n                    \n\n68  The defendants' proffered instruction stated in part:\n\n            Where  persons  have  joined together  to\n            further  one  common  unlawful design  or\n            purpose, a single conspiracy exists.   By\n            way  of  contrast, multiple  conspiracies\n            exist  when  there are  separate unlawful\n            agreements to achieve distinct purposes.\n                             . . . .\n            In  deciding  whether  a  single  overall\n            conspiracy as charged  in the  indictment\n            has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n            you  should look  at  whether there  were\n            multiple   agreements  reached,   whether\n            there  were  additions or  withdrawals of\n            alleged     conspirators,    and     most\n            significantly, whether the evidence shows\n            beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the\n            alleged   conspirators   directed   their\n            efforts  toward  the accomplishment  of a\n            common goal or overall plan.\n\n                               -88-\n\ndefendants, would allow for a plausible conclusion that more than\n\none  conspiracy took place, we start from the assumption that the\n\ntrial  court erred in its failure to give the multiple conspiracy\n\ninstructions.  Our task,  then, is to determine if  the degree of\n\nprejudice  from the possible  error necessitates a  reversal.  We\n\nfind that it does not.\n\n          We will reverse a  court's erroneous refusal to  give a\n\nsubstantively  correct  instruction  only  when  that instruction\n\nconcerned an important  point such  that the failure  to give  it\n\nseriously  undermined  the  defendant's  ability  to  effectively\n\npresent a given defense.

In  the   context  of  alleged   multiple\n\nconspiracies, the defendant's main concern is that jurors will be\n\nmisled into  attributing guilt to a particular defendant based on\n\nevidence  presented  against  others   who  were  involved  in  a\n\ndifferent and separate conspiratorial scheme.

Although\n\nthe  record  does  not  foreclose  the  possibility  of  multiple\n\nconspiracies, the  evidence convincingly indicates  the existence\n\nof  a  single, unified  conspiracy  in which  all  the defendants\n\nparticipated.    Thus,  all  of  the  evidence  would  have  been\n\navailable  to  the jury  for  consideration  of the  government's\n\nsingle conspiracy claim against  each defendant regardless of the\n\npossibility of multiple conspiracies.\n\n          Determining the number of  conspiracies in a particular\n\ncase  depends  on a  variety  of factors  including  the \"nature,\n\ndesign,  implementation, and logistics  of the  illegal activity;\n\nthe participants' modus operandi; the relevant geography; and the\n\nscope of coconspirator  involvement.\"  Boylan,  898 F.2d at  241;\n                                             \n\nUnited States v.

Defendants  all  worked\n\ntogether interdependently to further the entire scheme.  Hagopian\n\nand Ward  recruited buyers,  Gauvin, Granoff and  Reisch provided\n\nthe  buyers   with  down  payment  funds,   Kumalae  and  Landman\n\nfacilitated the  fraudulent representation of the  down payments,\n\nand  Brandon  coordinated  the   entire  conspiracy.    With  the\n\nexception of  Gauvin and  Granoff, all  of the  defendants played\n\nessentially the same role throughout the entire operation  of the\n\nconspiracy.69    Gauvin   and  Granoff  stopped   providing  down\n\npayment funds after Brandon stopped giving them their money back;\n\nhowever, negotiations between Brandon and the two continued until\n\nthe  scheme  ended.   Regardless, the  cessation of  Gauvin's and\n\nGranoff's funding did not represent the end of one conspiracy and\n\nthe beginning of a second one but a snag in the ongoing operation\n\nof the single conspiracy.  See  United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1512, 1522 (2d Cir. 1992) (finding acrimony among participants of\n\nconspiracy consistent with single conspiracy).\n\n          Defendants'  arguments   for  distinguishing  different\n\nconspiracies  have all been  previously rejected and  none of the\n\nfactors  they  highlight  indicates  the  existence  of  multiple\n\n                    \n\n69  Hagopian and Ward joined the scheme just two months after the\nfirst condominium sales.\n\n                               -91-\n\nconspiracies.   The presence  of different methods  of falsifying\n\nthe down payments --  e.g., recycled funds, nonnegotiated checks,\n\ndischargeable mortgages -- does not create separate conspiracies.\n\nSee,  e.g., Aracri, 968 F.2d at 1521-23; United States v. Aponte-\n                                                                 \n\nSu rez, 905 F.2d 483,  486-88 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  498 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n990  (1990); United States v.

This is  especially\n                   \n\ntrue because  the various  methods were used  interchangeably and\n\noften simultaneously  in furtherance  of an  identical objective.\n\nLikewise, the differing relationships various defendants had with\n\nthe  head conspirator,  Brandon, does  not signify  that multiple\n\nconspiracies existed.  See United States v. Bello-P rez, 977 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n664, 668 (1st  Cir. 1992);  United States v.

Here,  all  the  defendants  were  part  of  an\nintegrated,   interdependent  scheme  in   which  each  defendant\ndepended upon  and was connected to the others.  The scheme could\nnot function without a  steady stream of new buyers  recruited by\nHagopian and Ward.  New buyers were useless, however, unless they\ncould get down  payment funds  provided by  Gauvin, Granoff,  and\nReisch.   In  turn,  down payment  funds  could not  be  properly\nrecycled  or falsified  to defraud  the  bank unless  Landman and\nKumalae facilitated the transactions.\n\n                               -92-\n\nKelley, 849 F.2d 999, 1003 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 982\n                                                   \n\n(1988).  Finally, the  fact that Dean Street was engaged in other\n\nlicit  and illicit commercial enterprises does  not relate to the\n\npresent case against defendants and is irrelevant.\n\n          Almost all aspects of the government's case  describing\n\nthe  scheme to defraud Bay Loan were relevant to each defendant's\n\nrespective role in the conspiracy.  Thus, we see no risk that the\n\njury  based a defendant's  conviction on evidence  relating to an\n\nunrelated offense.  The  lack of prejudice is underscored  by the\n\nfact that  ample evidence  was presented against  each individual\n\ndefendant based on each defendant's  actions and statements.  See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Section  IV.   The jury  did not need  to rely  on evidence\n     \n\nrelating specifically  to other  defendants in order  to convict.\n\nIn  addition, the judge  repeatedly cautioned the  jury to assess\n\nthe evidence  separately against  each defendant.71   See Boylan,\n                                                                \n\n898  F.2d at  244  (finding similar  instructions contributed  to\n\nprotecting defendant's rights). \n\n                C.  Willful Blindness Instruction\n\n                    \n\n71   The  district court  also told  the jury  to determine  each\ncharge against each defendant based  only on the evidence against\nthat defendant on  that charge.   More  significantly, the  judge\nalso cautioned the jury:\n\n            to consider only  the evidence  regarding\n            that Defendant's actions  or the  actions\n            of individuals belonging to  a conspiracy\n            to  which  that Defendant  also belonged.\n            That is  to say, it would  be improper to\n            return a guilty verdict with respect to a\n            Defendant based on  evidence relating  to\n            acts committed by  someone belonging to a\n            conspiracy of which the Defendant was not\n            a member.\n\n                               -93-\n\n          The  district  court  instructed   the  jury  that  \"in\n\ndeciding  whether  a Defendant  acted  knowingly,  you may  infer\n\nknowledge  of a fact  if you find beyond  a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe  Defendant deliberately closed his or her eyes to a fact that\n\notherwise would  have  been obvious  to that  Defendant.\"72   The\n\nevidence  supporting this  instruction related only  to defendant\n\nLandman  but   the  instruction  was  given   generally  for  all\n\ndefendants  without any  mention of  Landman's name.   Defendants\n\nclaim the  instruction was  reversible error  because it  was not\n\napplicable to this case and because it caused the jury to convict\n\ndefendants  without  finding  sufficient  evidence  of  knowledge\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          We  find,  first  of  all,  that  the  instruction  was\n\n                    \n\n72  The rest of the court's willful blindness instruction stated:\n\n            In  order  to infer  knowledge,  you must\n            find   that   two   things    have   been\n            established.\n\n            First, that the Defendant was aware  of a\n            high probability of the fact in question.\n\n            And    second,    that   the    Defendant\n            consciously   and  deliberately   avoided\n            learning of those facts.  That is to say,\n            that the Defendant willfully made himself\n            blind to those facts.   It is entirely up\n            to you to  determine whether a  Defendant\n            deliberately  closed his  or her  eyes to\n            the facts and, if  so, what inference, if\n            any, should be drawn.\n\n            However, it  is important to bear in mind\n            that  mere  negligence   or  mistake   in\n            failing  to   learn  the  facts   is  not\n            sufficient.   There must  be a deliberate\n            effort to remain ignorant of the facts.\n\n                               -94-\n\nappropriate and accurate as to defendant Landman; hence, no error\n\nwas made  in his case.   The  trial court may  instruct the  jury\n\nconcerning willful  blindness when a  defendant claims a  lack of\n\nknowledge,   the  facts  support   an  inference  of  defendant's\n\nconscious course  of deliberate ignorance,  and the  instruction,\n\ntaken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood by a juror as mandating\n\nthe  inference  of knowledge.

More specifically, the  instruction is proper  when\n\nthere is  evidence to \"support  the inference that  the defendant\n\nwas aware of  a high probability of the existence  of the fact in\n\nquestion and  purposely contrived  to avoid  learning all of  the\n\nfacts  in order to  have a defense  in the event  of a subsequent\n\nprosecution.\"  United States v.

It  is not  the\ncase, as Landman argues, that a defendant must testify or present\nevidence  indicating  a  lack   of  knowledge  before  a  willful\nblindness  instruction can  be  deemed appropriate.   See  United\n                                                                 \nStates v.

The evidence also supports the conclusion that Landman\n\nknew about the scheme to fraudulently represent the  existence of\n\ndown payments.74    However, on  cross-examination,  the  defense\n\nattempted to impeach Marderosian's testimony that he told Landman\n\nabout  the dischargeable  second  mortgages to  be  given to  the\n\nbuyers  which  called  into  question  a key  piece  of  evidence\n\nregarding Landman's knowledge.  There was, nevertheless, evidence\n\nthat Landman tried to avoid learning of particular buyers' use of\n\ndischargeable mortgages for their  down payments.  During several\n\nclosings Landman was asked by  buyers about the second mortgages.\n\nOn one occasion,  he told the buyer that he  \"didn't want to know\n\nanything about it.\"   At other times, Landman  gestured in a  way\n\nthat one buyer described as trying to say \"not in front of me.\"\n\n          This  evidence is  sufficient to  support the  district\n\ncourt's  willful blindness  instruction.   The  attempt to  avoid\n\ndiscussion  of dischargeable  mortgages  with the  buyers can  be\n\ninterpreted as a \"pattern of behavior predicated upon a knowledge\n\nof  the conspiracy  together with a  desire to  limit inculpatory\n\nevidence of complicity.\"   United States v.

Mankani, 738 F.2d 538, 547 &amp;\n                                            \nn.1 (2d Cir. 1984) does not apply in this case.  First of all, at\nmost,  Mankani  stands  for   the  specific  proposition  that  a\n              \n\"conscious  avoidance\" instruction  cannot be  used  to establish\nmembership in a  conspiracy and not the more  general proposition\nthat the instruction is  never proper in a conspiracy case.   The\nwillful blindness instruction  in this  case had to  do with  the\nfinding that \"defendant acted knowingly\"  and not with a  finding\nthat defendant willfully joined the conspiracy.  In any event, to\nthe extent our holding in this case differs from that in Mankani,\n                                                                \nwe  agree  with the  Seventh  Circuit  that a  willful  blindness\ninstruction  can  be permissible  with  respect  to a  conspiracy\ncharge.   United States  v.  D az, 864  F.2d 544,  549 (7th  Cir.\n                                 \n1988), cert. denied,  490 U.S. 1070 (1989) (citing  United States\n                                                                 \nv.

On the  facts of this case, we are satisfied\n\nthat the jury could be expected to apply the instruction properly\n\nto defendants  whose conduct arguably calls  for that application\n\nand not randomly or  recklessly to defendants who do  not deserve\n\nthe instruction.  It is common during multi-defendant trials  for\n\nthe  court  to  give  a number  of  boilerplate  instructions  --\n\nconcerning,   for  example,   a  missing   witnesses,  accomplice\n\nliability,  or  withdrawal  from   the  conspiracy  --  that  are\n\npertinent,  on particular facts, to only one defendant and not to\n\nthe  others.   The instruction  in this case  is similar  in many\n\nrespects to  these other instructions and  is equally appropriate\n\ngiven the risk of prejudice  to the other defendants is low.   We\n\ndo  not exclude  the possibility  that, on  particular facts,  it\n\nmight so mislead  a jury  to give a  general instruction,  rather\n\nthan  one  tailored to  a specific  defendant  or rather  than no\n\ninstruction at  all, as  to be  an abuse  of  discretion, but  we\n\nemphasize that judgments  of this kind are primarily entrusted in\n\nthe  trial judge  who  inevitably has  a  superior feel  for  the\n\ndynamics of the trial and the likely reaction of the jury.\n\n          The danger of an improper willful blindness instruction\n\nis  \"'the possibility  that  the jury  will  be led  to  employ a\n\n                               -98-\n\nnegligence standard and convict  a defendant on the impermissible\n\nground  that he  should have  known [an  illegal act]  was taking\n\nplace.'\"  United  States v.  Littlefield, 840 F.2d  143, 148  n.3\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  488 U.S.  860 (1988) (quoting  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

In this case, as in Littlefield,  840 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n147-48, the willful blindness  instruction clearly had little, if\n\nany, effect  on the jury's verdict.   First of all,  unlike those\n\ncases  where  insufficient  facts  were present  to  support  any\n\nwillful blindness  instruction at all,  see,  e.g., United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

The jury had an  opportunity\n\nto  correctly apply  the  instruction  and  was  less  likely  to\n\nimproperly   consider  a   defendant's   willful   blindness   in\n\nconjunction  with  facts  that  only supported  that  defendant's\n\ndirect knowledge, or complete lack of knowledge.  Thus, there was\n\nlittle  risk  that  the  jury  was  confused  into  convicting  a\n\ndefendant  who  merely  should  have  known  about  the  criminal\n\nventure.  See United States v.  D az, 864 F.2d 544, 551 (7th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988); see also Rivera, 944 F.2d at 1570-71.\n                      \n\n          In  addition,  the  instructions  properly  and clearly\n\ndirected  the jury not to find knowledge based on mere negligence\n\nand extensively instructed  the jury as  to the requirements  for\n\nfinding  knowing  participation  in  the  conspiracy  and knowing\n\n                               -99-\n\nexecution  of bank fraud.   See Littlefield, 840  F.2d at 147-48;\n                                           \n\nD az, 864  F.2d at 551.  The court instructed the jury that \"mere\n    \n\nnegligence  or mistake  in  failing to  learn  the facts  is  not\n\nsufficient\" and that  a defendant's willful  ignorance had to  be\n\ndeliberate   beyond  a   reasonable   doubt.     Throughout   the\n\ninstructions,  the court told the jury that the government had to\n\nprove each and  every element  of the  offenses, including  those\n\nelements  requiring knowledge,  beyond a  reasonable doubt.   For\n\nexample, knowing participation in  the scheme to defraud required\n\nthe  actions  of  each  defendant  to  be  \"done  voluntarily and\n\nintentionally  and not  because of  mistake or  accident or  some\n\nother  innocent reason.\"    The court  was  clear that  to  prove\n\nparticipation in a  conspiracy, the government  must show that  a\n\n\"defendant  knew  of  the  existence of  the  conspiracy  and its\n\nunlawful  purpose\"  and  the  court  added  that  \"knowledge  and\n\nwillfulness like  all of the  other elements  of a crime  must be\n\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Twice the district court\n\nexplained that actual proof of knowledge was essential \"to insure\n\nthat no one will be convicted for  an act that he or she did  not\n\nintend to  commit  or the  nature  of which  he  or she  did  not\n\nunderstand.\"\n\n          The instructions,  taken as  a whole,  went a long  way\n\ntoward curing any possible prejudice that may  have resulted from\n\nthe willful blindness instruction.  As evidence of this, the jury\n\ndelivered  verdicts  that demonstrated  it  was  not confused  or\n\naffected by the willful  blindness instruction.  Three defendants\n\n                              -100-\n\nwere acquitted on  multiple bank  fraud counts and  a fourth  was\n\nacquitted  on one  count of  bank fraud.   Defendant  Landman was\n\nacquitted  on one count in which  the principal witness testified\n\nthat  Landman  did not  want to  know  about the  second mortgage\n\ndischarges.  Thus, it appears that the jury declined to apply the\n\nwillful blindness instruction when  it was given the first  clear\n\nopportunity to do so.  We therefore find no error  in the court's\n\ndecision to give a general willful blindness instruction.\n\n              X.  REHEARING OF TESTIMONY BY THE JURY\n\n          Defendant Gauvin assigns error to  the district court's\n\nfailure to read back certain testimony to the jury in response to\n\nthe jury's request.  Four days into the jury's deliberations, the\n\njury  asked to  rehear  several areas  of  testimony.   One  jury\n\nrequest stated:  \"We would  also like to review the testimony  of\n\nMr. Marderosian  concerning  a  meeting   in  which  Mr.  Gauvin,\n\nMr. Granoff and Mr. Brandon  discussed the purchase of  Pidge and\n\nMeeting  Street.\"  As several  references were made  to Pidge and\n\nMeeting Street it  was not  clear which discussion  the jury  was\n\nreferring to.  The court and  the attorneys spent nearly two days\n\ntrying  to cull together the parts of the transcript that related\n\nto all of the requested subject  matter.  At one point, the court\n\nsuggested,  and  the prosecutor  later  argued,  that the  entire\n\ntranscript of  Marderosian's testimony should be  provided to the\n\njury, but counsel for Granoff objected to this suggestion.\n\n          The court read to  the jury a portion  of Marderosian's\n\ntestimony relating to Pidge  and Meeting Street and to  a meeting\n\n                              -101-\n\nwhere  the Pidge project was discussed.  Against the objection of\n\nGauvin's counsel,  the court stopped reading  the transcript just\n\nbefore testimony concerning  additional meetings relating to  the\n\nsame deal as the  one involving Pidge and Meeting  Street but not\n\nspecifically mentioning  Pidge  or Meeting  Street.   We find  no\n\nabuse of discretion  in the  trial judge's decision  not to  read\n\nadditional portions of the transcript. \n\n          The decision  to reread  testimony rests  entirely upon\n\nthe trial  court's sound discretion.   United States  v. Akitoye,\n                                                                \n\n923  F.2d 221, 226 (1st  Cir. 1991); United  States v. Argentine,\n                                                                \n\n814  F.2d 783,  787  (1st Cir.  1987)  (citing United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nAlmonte,  594 F.2d 261,  265 (1st Cir.  1979)).  The  exercise of\n       \n\nthat  discretion  should not  be  disturbed  absent good  reason.\n\nArgentine, 814 F.2d at 787.    \n         \n\n          In this  case, the trial judge, with advice of counsel,\n\nreviewed  the record  for two  days in  order to  locate material\n\nresponsive  to  the jury's  request.   Faced  with a  request for\n\ntestimony  relating to  a meeting  discussing \"Pidge  and Meeting\n\nStreet\" and  faced with multiple references to  Pidge and Meeting\n\nStreet  in  the  record,  the judge  decided  to  read  testimony\n\nconcerning  a meeting where Pidge  was mentioned but  not to read\n\ntestimony relating  to a  subsequent meeting  in which Pidge  and\n\nMeeting Street were  not mentioned.  We find  this decision to be\n\nappropriately within the judge's discretion.\n\n          The fact that the  omitted testimony concerned the same\n\ndeal as the one  involving Pidge and Meeting Street  and the fact\n\n                              -102-\n\nthat  it   also  contained   some  discussion  of   down  payment\n\narrangements  does not suggest any abuse of discretion.  First of\n\nall, to the extent  the omitted testimony is crucial  to Gauvin's\n\ndefense,  as  he  claims,  we  find  the  testimony  to  be  more\n\ninculpatory  in nature  than  exculpatory.76   More  importantly,\n\nthe  judge was  attempting  to respond  appropriately  to a  jury\n\nrequest that  turned out to be  far from narrowly  focussed.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n76  The omitted testimony included the following:\n\n            A.  Mr.  Brandon explained to  Mr. Gauvin\n            and Mr. Granoff that  Homeowners required\n            a  twenty-five  percent down  payment and\n            while  that  down  payment  would  not be\n            required of Mr.  Gauvin and Mr.  Granoff,\n            he  did  have  the  problem  of  the down\n            payment with subsequent purchasers and he\n            asked  Mr. Gauvin  and  Mr.  Granoff  for\n            their assistance in meeting that problem.\n\n            Q.   What,  if anything  did  Mr.  Gauvin\n            respond?\n\n            A.   Mr. Gauvin, as I  recall, initially,\n            didn't quite understand what  Mr. Brandon\n            wanted  and  after  further  explanation,\n            Mr. Gauvin  responded  that  he might  be\n            interested  under  some circumstances  in\n            helping out.\n\n            Q.  What about Mr. Granoff?\n\n            A.  I  believe Mr. Granoff indicated  his\n            consent also.\n\n   Defendant  Gauvin claims  this  testimony was  crucial to  his\ndefense  because   it  corrects  a   mischaracterization  in  the\ngovernment's closing  argument about what Marderosian  said about\nthe down payments.   Defense counsel explicitly told the  jury to\nreview the  testimony regarding the  alleged mischaracterization.\nWe have some doubts,  given the request for a  meeting concerning\n\"Pidge  and Meeting  Streets,\" that  this particular  request was\nrelated  to the issue of the alleged mischaracterization.  In any\nevent, we find  no abuse  of discretion in  the judge's  decision\nthat the omitted material was not what the jury was looking for.\n\n                              -103-\n\nAkitoye, 923 F.2d at 226.  The extra burdens on the court created\n       \n\nby rehearing testimony is  relevant to judging the reasonableness\n\nof the court's  refusal to read back testimony to  the jury.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.   If  the  trial judge  had  searched for  all  the testimony\n  \n\nrelated to the deal involving Pidge and Meeting Street or all the\n\ndiscussions of down payment arrangements for that deal, the judge\n\nwould have had to spend considerably more time and effort than he\n\nhad already expended.  Such extra effort was not required.  \n\n          XI.  REFUSAL TO APPOINT PARALEGAL FOR BRANDON\n\n          Defendant Brandon alleges that the trial court's denial\n\nof his request for a court-appointed paralegal denied him his due\n\nprocess right to present a defense.  Prior to the indictment, the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation took possession of 137 file boxes\n\nfrom Dean Street's offices which contained documents kept by Dean\n\nStreet.  Although Brandon was given complete access to the files,\n\nhe claims  that without the  services of  a paralegal he  and his\n\ncourt-appointed attorney were incapable of meaningfully examining\n\nthe  contents of  the files,  effectively denying  him access  to\n\npotentially exculpatory  evidence.  Brandon and  his attorney did\n\nspend four hours one afternoon examining the contents of three of\n\nthe file boxes.\n\n          Defendant cites Brady v.  Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),\n                                            \n\nand its progeny for  the proposition that his due  process rights\n\nwere  violated.   Brady requires  the government to  disclose any\n                       \n\nexculpatory  evidence  that is  \"material either  to guilt  or to\n\npunishment.\"   Brady, 373 U.S. at  87.  Before we  even reach the\n                    \n\n                              -104-\n\nissue  of  whether the  lack  of  paralegal services  effectively\n\nconstituted a failure of the  government to disclose evidence, we\n\nmust first  consider whether  the defendant established  that the\n\nfile  boxes contained potentially  exculpatory, or even material,\n\nevidence in the first place.\n\n          To  establish a  violation of  Brady, a  defendant must\n                                              \n\nprovide  the  court with  some indication  that the  materials to\n\nwhich he  or she  needs access contain  material and  potentially\n\nexculpatory evidence.  See United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667,\n                                                  \n\n674 (1985); cf.  United States v.  Mateos-S nchez, 864 F.2d  232,\n                                                 \n\n240 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that a Criminal Justice Act rule, 18\n\nU.S.C.    3006A(e)(1),  which  provides  for  the  provision   to\n\ndefendants of necessary investigative or other services, requires\n\na  defendant  to make  at least  some  showing why  the requested\n\nassistance would  produce evidence \"likely  to be pivotal  to his\n\ndefense\").  In  his initial  request before the  trial court  and\n\nsubsequently on  appeal, the  defendant speculated that  the Dean\n\nStreet files  might contain exculpatory evidence.   Brandon never\n\npresented,  however,  any  supporting  evidence  or  arguments to\n\nindicate this was,  in fact, the  case.  Because Brandon  did not\n\nmake  any  showing  at  all  as to  the  nature  of  the disputed\n\nmaterials, we find no  error in the court's refusal to  appoint a\n\nparalegal for Brandon's defense.\n\n          This  is not  a Catch-22  situation in  which defendant\n\ncannot make the initial showing needed to get a paralegal without\n\nfirst having a paralegal to assist in making the initial showing.\n\n                              -105-\n\nInstead, the  defendant can  establish the possible  existence of\n\nmaterial  and  exculpatory  evidence   by,  at  the  very  least,\n\ndescribing the kinds of  documents that might be in  files which,\n\nif  they were found, might  exculpate the defendant.77   At most,\n\ndefendant and  counsel  could have  spent a  few more  afternoons\n\nlooking in the files for representative samples of documents that\n\nmight be useful to the defense.  We do not think this  places too\n\nmuch of a burden on defendant or defendant's counsel.\n\n                XII.  CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ERRORS\n\n          Defendants argue that the cumulative effect of numerous\n\nalleged  errors made before and during the trial deprived them of\n\na fair trial and enabled the  jury to convict despite the lack of\n\nevidence against each  individual defendant.   Our review of  the\n\nrecord and trial proceedings as a whole does not reveal pervasive\n\nunfairness or  any error or  combination of errors  that deprived\n\nthe defendants of due process.  See United States v. Barnett, 989\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 546,  560 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 114 S.  Ct. 148 (1993);\n                                        \n\nUnited States v.  Steffen, 641  F.2d 591, 598  (8th Cir.),  cert.\n                                                                \n\ndenied,  452 U.S. 943 (1981).   We thus  conclude that defendants\n      \n\nreceived a fair trial.\n\n                        XIII.  SENTENCING\n\n                    \n\n77  Brandon posits in his brief that the files may have contained\na letter from Bay  Loan acknowledging that no down  payments were\nrequired.  This example was  not pointed out to the  trial judge.\nEven if the  example was  presented at trial,  however, it  would\nprobably not, by itself, be sufficient to establish the existence\nof   material  exculpatory   evidence  without   some  additional\nsubstantiation.   Defendant made no  claim as to  the probability\nsuch a letter exists  nor provided an affidavit that  he received\nsuch correspondence.\n\n                              -106-\n\n             A.  Amount of Loss and Relevant Conduct\n\n          Defendants  attack  the district  court's determination\n\nand  apportionment  of  Bay  Loan's  losses  for  the purpose  of\n\ncalculating  their sentences  under the  Sentencing Guidelines.78\n\nThe district court set the offense level for each defendant based\n\non  the actual  loss  to Bay  Loan resulting  from the  scheme to\n\ndefraud.  See  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1; United States  v. Haggert,  980\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1992).  The court  arrived at a figure of\n\n$11.4 million by reducing the outstanding principal amount of the\n\nfraudulently obtained end loans by, among other things, the value\n\nof the collateral used  to secure them.  The court  then included\n\nthe  entire amount  of  the  loss  in  the  calculation  of  each\n\ndefendant's offense  level under    2F1.1.   The resulting  total\n\noffense level was set by adding an 11-level  increase to the base\n\noffense  level because  the total  loss was over  $5,000,000, the\n\nhighest  point on  the  loss  scale at  that  time.   U.S.S.G.   \n\n2F1.1(b)(1).\n\n          The  defendants first  challenge  the district  court's\n\nvaluation of the collateral used to  secure the loans.  We review\n\nthe valuation for  clear error.   United States v.  St. Cyr,  977\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).  Determination of actual loss need\n\nnot be precise; \"[t]he court need only make a reasonable estimate\n\nof the range of loss, given the available information.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1 comment note 8.\n\n                    \n\n78  The district court applied the 1988 version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines   and  therefore   all  citations,   unless  otherwise\nindicated, are to that version.\n\n                              -107-\n\n          The court  determined the value of  the collateral used\n\nto secure the loan  after an evidentiary hearing with  respect to\n\nthe amount of loss.   At this hearing, the court heard  testimony\n\nby Bay Loan's president and a real estate appraiser called by the\n\ndefense.  The court also reviewed exhibits containing information\n\non the value of each of the motel condominiums.  Defendants argue\n\nthat the  $2.7 million dollar figure  chosen by the  court as the\n\ntotal value of  the collateral (the motels) was  improperly based\n\non a  1991 appraisal as opposed to  an earlier 1989 appraisal for\n\n$7.8  million.    Defendant  seems  to  argue  that  the  earlier\n\nappraisal is the more accurate one because  it was made closer to\n\nthe time of the  crime and because  the latter appraisal is  more\n\nlikely to be  affected by  causes not related  to the actions  of\n\ndefendants.   Given  the  evidentiary basis  -- a  professionally\n\nprepared  appraisal --  for  the trial  court's determination  of\n\nloss, however, we do not see any error, let alone clear error, in\n\nthe court's  decision  to  choose  the  lower  valuation  of  the\n\ncollateral. \n\n          A  more significant  objection  raised by  many of  the\n\ndefendants  is that the court improperly assigned to each of them\n\nthe  entire value  of  the loss  regardless  of their  degree  of\n\nparticipation  in the scheme to defraud Bay Loan.  The Guidelines\n\nprovide   that  for  conspiracy   convictions,  relevant  conduct\n\n\"includes conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy that was known\n\nto or was reasonably  foreseeable by the defendant.\"   U.S.S.G.  \n\n1B1.3(a)(1)  comment note 1;  see also United  States v. O'Campo,\n                                                                \n\n                              -108-\n\n973 F.2d  1015, 1023  (1st Cir. 1992).   This  language has  been\n\nsubsequently clarified  to state  that relevant  conduct includes\n\n\"all  reasonably  foreseeable acts  and  omissions  of others  in\n\nfurtherance  of  the   jointly  undertaken  criminal   activity.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1)(B), 1993 Guidelines.   The  clarification\n\nwas designed  to highlight the  distinction between the  scope of\n\ncriminal liability  and the  scope of sentencing  accountability.\n\nRegardless,  \"[t]he  central  concept  then  is  foreseeability.\"\n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d at 1023.\n       \n\n          There is first the question in this case of whether the\n\ndistrict  court applied the  correct standard  of foreseeability.\n\nDefendants argue  that instead  of limiting the  determination of\n\nlosses  that each  individual defendant  could foresee  solely to\n\nthose  losses  connected  with   the  criminal  activity  that  a\n\nparticular  defendant agreed  to jointly  undertake,79 the  court\n\nsimply held all  the defendants  responsible for  all the  losses\n\nattributable to the entire  scope of the conspiracy.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.  Lanni, 970 F.2d 1092 (2d Cir.  1992).  While it\n                       \n\nis true that the criminal venture a defendant intended to join is\n\n                    \n\n79   The  1993  Guidelines  define, in  a  rather  unilluminating\nfashion,  \"criminal activity the  particular defendant  agreed to\njointly  undertake\" as  \"the scope  of the  specific  conduct and\nobjectives embraced  by the  defendant's agreement.\"   U.S.S.G.  \n1B1.3 comment note  2, 1993 Guidelines.  The  Guidelines go on to\npoint out  that \"the criminal activity that  the defendant agreed\nto jointly  undertake, and the reasonably  foreseeable conduct of\nothers  in  furtherance  of   that  criminal  activity,  are  not\nnecessarily  identical.\"  Id.  In other words, one can reasonably\n                            \nforesee conduct in furtherance of an agreed upon  enterprise even\nthough  one did not specifically agree to join in that particular\nconduct.  Id.\n            \n\n                              -109-\n\nnot necessarily the same  as the scope of the  entire conspiracy,\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3  comment note  2, 1993 Guidelines,  there is  no\n\nreason why a defendant cannot intend to join and thus foresee the\n\noperation  of   the  entire   conspiracy.    As   the  Guidelines\n\nacknowledge,   the  two   can   be  coterminous,   although  \"not\n\nnecessarily\" so.\n\n          In  this case, the district court did find the scope of\n\nthe  conspiracy  and the  scope  of  the  foreseeable conduct  in\n\nfurtherance  of  each  defendant's  jointly  undertaken  criminal\n\nactivity  to  be  the  same.    The  judge  held  the  defendants\n\nresponsible for \"acts of co-conspirators to the extent that those\n\nacts were  committed in furtherance  of the  conspiracy and  were\n\nknown  to or reasonably foreseeable by the Defendant.\"  The judge\n\nthen  recited  all  the  actions taken  by  each  defendant which\n\nindicated  they were  involved  in  the  entire  breadth  of  the\n\nconspiracy.80    Most telling  is  the  judge's statement  during\n\nsentencing that \"the agreement that each [defendant] entered into\n\nwas  to participate in a  continuing scheme to  obtain loans from\n\nBay Loan  by means  of fraudulent misrepresentations.\"   Although\n\nthe sentencing judge  did not employ all  the expository language\n\nrecently added to the  Guidelines, it is evident from  the record\n\nthat  he conducted the proper analysis.   We thus see no error in\n\n                    \n\n80   This is not a  case where the sentencing  court merely found\nthat the  defendant \"knew what was  going on.\"  See  O'Campo, 973\n                                                            \nF.2d  at 1025.   The judge in this  case recounted specific facts\nregarding  each individual  defendant which  indicated that  each\ndefendant  embraced the full scope  of the scheme  to defraud Bay\nLoan.  See id. at 1025-26 n.11.\n             \n\n                              -110-\n\nthe district court's application of the Guidelines.\n\n          Several  defendants contend  that some  portion of  the\n\nloss  was  not  foreseeable  to  them  because  of their  limited\n\nparticipation in the scheme.   Each claims the court  should have\n\nreduced by some unspecified amount  the loss attributable to  him\n\nor  her as  relevant  conduct.    The  determination  of  what  a\n\ndefendant can  foresee for  the purposes of  determining relevant\n\nconduct at sentencing is inherently fact-bound and, consequently,\n\nreviewable only  for clear error.   United States  v. Innamorati,\n                                                                \n\n996 F.2d 456, 489 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          All the defendants, except Hagopian, Ward  and Kumalae,\n\nwere  involved in the  scheme to defraud  Bay Loan from  the very\n\nbeginning.    Before  the  scheme  was  first  executed,  Brandon\n\ndiscussed  with Reisch methods  to avoid making  down payments on\n\nthe end  loans.   The first  unit sales were  made to  Gauvin and\n\nGranoff  with Landman acting as escrow agent.  The involvement of\n\nthese defendants continued  throughout the scheme and we  find no\n\nclearly discernable limits  to the scope of  the criminal venture\n\nin  which they agreed to participate such that the district court\n\nerred in finding all the losses from the entire conspiracy  to be\n\nforeseeable.   The fact that  Gauvin and Granoff  stopped lending\n\ndown payment funds after  February of 1988 does not  absolve them\n\nof responsibility for the continued actions of  the conspiracy to\n\nobtain more  loans from Bay Loan.   The issue is  not whether the\n\ntwo continued to  commit acts  in furtherance of  the scheme  but\n\nwhether, at  the time  of the relevant  conduct, they  reasonably\n\n                              -111-\n\ncould  have  foreseen the  actions of  the  other members  of the\n\nconspiracy.       The   evidence,    particularly   the   ongoing\n\ncorrespondence with  Brandon made until  the end  of the  scheme,\n\nclearly indicates that  Gauvin and Granoff not only could foresee\n\nthe continued sale of condominium units, they actually knew about\n\nit.81\n\n          We have  recently held that a  defendant's base offense\n\nlevel cannot be based  on knowledge of historic facts.   O'Campo,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at  1022-26.  Thus,  with respect to Hagopian,  Ward and\n\nKumalae, losses attributable to fraudulent activity that occurred\n\nbefore  they   became  involved  in  the   conspiracy  cannot  be\n\nconsidered as relevant  conduct.   See id.   The judge's  error82\n                                         \n\nin  this regard, however, had no effect  on their sentences so we\n\nfind no reason for reversal on this issue.\n\n          Hagopian  and  Ward  did  not become  involved  in  the\n\n                    \n\n81  We disagree with Gauvin and Granoff that the evidence clearly\nindicates some kind of withdrawal from the conspiracy so that the\nscope  of the  criminal venture  in which  they  participated was\nlimited  to something less than the entire conspiracy.  The trial\njudge carefully considered this  issue and we see no  clear error\nin his rejection of their arguments.\n\n   Similar arguments are made by Hagopian, Ward and Reisch to the\neffect that they were not responsible for sales arranged by other\nbrokers  or  funded  by  other  people.    These   arguments  are\nunavailing.  The  defendants agreed to participate in  the entire\noperation,  even  though  their  individual role  may  have  been\nlimited  to  a  specific  function  within  the  broader  scheme.\nConsequently, only a showing of  the foreseeability of the  other\nco-conspirators'   conduct  is  required  to  find  that  conduct\nrelevant  for  sentencing  purposes.     That  standard,  as  the\nsentencing judge correctly found, was clearly met.\n\n82  We  note that, to  the district judge's  credit, the  O'Campo\n                                                                 \ndecision  settling this issue was not handed down until after the\njudge conducted the sentencing of the defendants in this case.\n\n                              -112-\n\nconspiracy  until  after  October  of  1987,  after  all  of  the\n\nCharlestown  units had already been  sold.  Kumalae  did not join\n\nuntil after some units had already been sold  at the Bayside, the\n\nsecond motel  involved in the  scheme.  It  may well be  arguable\n\nthat the total losses to Bay Loan resulted from conduct occurring\n                     \n\nafter  the  participation  of   these  three  defendants.    When\n\nHagopian, Ward  and Kumalae joined the  conspiracy, payments were\n\nbeing  made on the  end loans.   It was  not until the  scheme to\n\ndefraud expanded to more and more condominium units that it began\n\nto  collapse under its own  weight as additional  loan funds from\n\nBay Loan were required to pay off  the existing obligations.  The\n\nconduct of Hagopian, Ward  and Kumalae, therefore, contributed to\n\nthe overall losses to  Bay Loan which took  place when the  loans\n\ndefaulted.\n\n          More importantly, however, even if the losses resulting\n\nfrom the loans  made for  the Charlestown and  Bayside units  are\n\nexcluded  from  the  loss  calculation  for  Hagopian,  Ward  and\n\nKumalae,  the  total would  still be  well  over $5  million, the\n\nhighest level  under the  1988 version  of U.S.S.G.    2F1.1.   A\n\nlion's share of the loans  were made for units in the  five other\n\nmotels  after  all  the  defendants had  joined  the  conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, any error in  apportioning losses was harmless because\n\nit   did  not  affect   the  offense   level  assigned   to  each\n\ndefendant.83\n\n                    \n\n83  We also find no error in the district court's refusal to take\ninto account multiple causes for Bay Loan's losses in determining\nthe  sentences.     \"'[T]he  victim  loss  table  in  U.S.S.G.   \n\n                              -113-\n\n      B.  Upward Adjustments for More Than Minimal Planning\n\n          Defendants  Granoff, Ward  and Landman  argue that  the\n\ndistrict  court committed  clear  error by  imposing a  two-level\n\nincrease  in   their   offense  levels,   pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2)(A), for  more than minimal planning.84   \"More than\n\nminimal planning\" is defined as:\n\n            [M]ore  planning  than  is   typical  for\n            commission  of the  offense  in a  simple\n            form.  \"More than minimal  planning\" also\n            exists  if significant  affirmative steps\n            were taken to conceal the offense.\n\n            \"More  than  minimal planning\"  is deemed\n            present  in  any case  involving repeated\n            acts over a period  of time, unless it is\n            clear  that  each  instance   was  purely\n            opportune.  Consequently, this adjustment\n            will   apply  especially   frequently  in\n            property offenses.\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.1, comment note 1(f).\n\n          We  review   the  district  court's   minimal  planning\n\n                    \n\n2F1.1(b)(1) presumes that the  defendant alone is responsible for\nthe entire amount of victim loss specified in the particular loss\nrange  selected  by the  sentencing  court.'\"   United  States v.\n                                                              \nShattuck, 961  F.2d 1012,  1016 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (quoting United\n                                                                 \nStates v.  Gregorio, 956  F.2d 341,  347 (1st  Cir. 1992)).   The\n                   \nGuidelines treat multiple causation only as a possible ground for\ndownward departure -- a matter within the sound discretion of the\nsentencing court.  Shattuck, 961 F.2d at 1017; Gregorio, 956 F.2d\n                                                       \nat  346-48.  In this  case, the sentencing  court, upon extensive\nconsideration  of the issue, declined to  grant such a departure.\nNone of  the  factors  that  defendants  point  to  as  allegedly\ncontributing  to  Bay Loan's  losses  are  so  compelling  as  to\nconvince us that the court erred in reaching its decision.\n\n84   To the extent defendant Gauvin also appeals this decision by\nreference  in his brief to arguments made by the other defendants\nwe find no error.   As there is no error with regard to defendant\nGranoff,  there can also be no error for Gauvin whose involvement\nin the scheme  was greater than  Granoff's.  The same  applies to\ndefendant Hagopian  whose involvement was  greater than defendant\nWard's.\n\n                              -114-\n\nassessment only for clear error.  United States v. Beauchamp, 986\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1, 5 (1st  Cir. 1993).   We are  not inclined  to reverse a\n\nfinding of more than minimal planning unless the evidence compels\n\nthe conclusion that defendant's  actions were purely opportune or\n\n\"spur of the  moment.\"  Gregorio, 956 F.2d at  343; United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 361 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"We cannot conceive of\n      \n\nhow obtaining even  one fraudulent  loan would  not require  more\n\nthan minimal planning.\").\n\n          In light of the rather complex and sophisticated scheme\n\ninvolved in  this case,  we find any  assignment of error  to the\n\nsentencing  judge's ruling  that the  defendants engaged  in more\n\nthan  minimal planning to be  rather far-fetched.   In any event,\n\nthe judge made more than adequate findings based on the record to\n\nsupport  his  decision.   The  judge  found  that  Ward took  the\n\ninitiative  to find buyers for the scheme and helped falsify down\n\npayments which constituted \"repeated acts\" over a period of time.\n\nWard protests that there  is no evidence that he  \"initiated\" any\n\nof the contacts  with the buyers.  This is  mere quibbling.  Ward\n\nwas actively involved in the recruitment process, he told  buyers\n\nno  down payments were required,  he told buyers  to provide down\n\npayments  checks that  he knew  would not  be negotiated,  and he\n\nprovided buyers with  rebates for  their purchases.   Any one  of\n\nthese  facts  would  support  a  finding  of  more  than  minimal\n\nplanning. \n\n          As for defendant Granoff, the district court found that\n\nthe scheme to  defraud Bay  Loan involved more  planning than  is\n\n                              -115-\n\ntypical  for  commission  of  the  offense  in  its  simple form.\n\nLooking at the scheme as a whole, this fact is indisputable.  But\n\nthis  fact is  also  true when  viewed  from the  perspective  of\n\nGranoff's specific  involvement.  Granoff first  met with Brandon\n\nin  the summer  of 1987  to discuss  the condominium  project and\n\neventually he agreed  to purchase  some units and  to fund  buyer\n\ndown  payments.   Pursuant to  this agreement,  Granoff purchased\n\nfour units in August of  1987 in which funds were recycled  via a\n\nsophisticated  arrangement.    Five  months  later,  he  provided\n\n$470,000 to Dean Street on the understanding it would be returned\n\nto him  after it was used to fund buyers' down payments.  Granoff\n\nalso  formed  a partnership  with Gauvin  to  invest in  the Dean\n\nStreet project.   All of these  activities reflect a  significant\n\nlevel of involvement in the  scheme.  We therefore find no  error\n\nin his case.\n\n          Finally,   the  sentencing  judge  found  that  Landman\n\nengaged  in  \"repeated acts\"  during the  scheme  in his  role as\n\nescrow  agent   or  closing  attorney   for  most  of   the  loan\n\ntransactions.  There is no basis for any error in his case.\n\n  C.  Denial of Role-In-The-Offense Decrease for Marvin Granoff\n\n          Defendant Granoff claims the  court erred in finding he\n\nwas not a minor  participant and thus not entitled to  a decrease\n\nin his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G   3B1.2(b).  \"[A]  minor\n\nparticipant means  any participant who is less culpable than most\n\nother  participants.\" U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b)  comment note  3, 1993\n\nGuidelines.  No defendant,  however, is automatically entitled to\n\n                              -116-\n\na  reduction, even if the  defendant happens to  be less culpable\n\nthan his or her co-defendants.  United States v. Valencia-Lucena,\n                                                                \n\n925 F.2d 506, 514 (1st Cir. 1991); United  States v. Rexford, 903\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1280, 1282 (9th Cir. 1990).  The sentencing court has broad\n\ndiscretion  in determining  whether  this downward  departure  is\n\nappropriate   and  we   will   reverse  only   if  the   evidence\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant played a part that\n\nmakes   him  substantially   less  culpable   than  the   average\n\nparticipant  in  the  convicted  offense such  that  the  court's\n\ndecision  was  clearly erroneous.    Gregorio, 956  F.2d  at 344;\n                                             \n\nUnited States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                       \n\n          Although the district court found that Granoff was less\n\nculpable than the  major participants in the scheme like Brandon,\n\nthe  court found that  Granoff did play  more than  a minor role.\n\nThe $470,000 Granoff provided  to fund buyer down payments  was a\n\nsignificant contribution to the  scheme to defraud Bay Loan.   We\n\nfind  that the record  supports the court's  finding that Granoff\n\nwas not less culpable than most of the other defendants let alone\n\nsubstantially  less culpable  than  an average  defendant and  we\n\ntherefore affirm Granoff's sentence.85\n\n                    \n\n85    Granoff also  claims  that the  district  court erroneously\nfailed  to  depart  downward  based   on  his  age  and  physical\ncondition, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5H1.1 and   5H1.4.  This  issue\nis not properly before the court because defendant did not seek a\ndownward departure on this  basis during sentencing.  See  United\n                                                                 \nStates v.  Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st  Cir. 1992).  The issue of\n                \nage and health were raised only with respect to the  range of the\nsentence  and to  bail  pending  appeal.    Thus,  the  issue  of\ndeparture based on  age and physical condition was  not preserved\nfor appeal.\n\n                              -117-\n\n     D.  Costs of Supervised Release and Special Assessments\n\n          The government correctly concedes  that our decision in\n\nUnited States v. Corral, 964 F.2d 83, 84 (1st Cir. 1992) mandates\n                       \n\nthat  we find erroneous the  court's decision to  impose costs of\n\nsupervised  release on five  defendants found to  be indigent for\n\npurposes of a punitive fine.  We therefore reverse the imposition\n\nof supervised release costs on defendants Brandon, Ward, Landman,\n\nHagopian, and Kumalae.\n\n          Brandon further argues that because he is indigent, the\n\ndistrict court was without  authority to order him to  pay either\n\nrestitution or the  statutory assessments.  In  imposing an order\n\nof restitution,  the district court  must consider  not only  the\n\namount  of the victim's loss but also \"the financial resources of\n\nthe  defendant, the financial  needs and  earning ability  of the\n\ndefendant and the defendant's  dependents, and such other factors\n\nas the court  deems appropriate.\"   18 U.S.C.    3664(a);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1993).\n                \n\n          In  this  case,  the  sentencing  judge considered  the\n\nrequired factors  and, without  error, arrived at  the conclusion\n\nthat a $500,000  restitution order, payable after  the three year\n\nperiod of supervised release, was appropriate.  Specifically, the\n\njudge  stated:   \"[I]n arriving  at that  figure, Mr.  Brandon, I\n\nrecognize that based on the pre-sentence report, you don't appear\n\nto have  any assets at the  present time but it  appears that you\n\nhave the prospect of  receiving or inheriting some assets  in the\n\nfuture.\"   The court also  noted that a  man of Brandon's talents\n\n                              -118-\n\nought to be able to obtain gainful employment upon release.\n\n          Although the  restitution order may be  burdensome, and\n\nalthough it  may be true to  some extent that \"if  a defendant is\n\nindigent  for purposes  of one  [fine], he  must be  indigent for\n\npurposes of the other.\"  United States v. Labat 915 F.2d 603, 607\n                                               \n\n(10th  Cir. 1990),  we  do not  think  Corral's ban  on  imposing\n                                             \n\ncertain  fines on  indigent  defendants  extends  to  restitution\n\norders.   Corral  dealt specifically  with  the interplay  of two\n                \n\nprovisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G.  \n\n5E1.2(a) and    5E1.2(i).  Corral, 964  F.2d at 84.   We found in\n                                 \n\nthat case that because  the fine imposed under   5E1.2(i)  was an\n\nadditional fine  to be instituted  only in  conjunction with  the\n\npunitive fine imposed under    5E1.2(a), the former could  not be\n\nimposed  once  the  latter  was  waived  because  of  defendant's\n\nindigency.   Id.  In the case of restitution, however, a separate\n               \n\nstatutory  scheme has  been  established which  includes its  own\n\nindependent  consideration of  defendant's  ability to  pay.   18\n\nU.S.C.   3664.  Therefore,  the district court's determination of\n\nindigency  under  U.S.S.G    5E1.2(a)  in  the  present  case  is\n\nindependent of and does not affect its ruling on restitution.86\n\n          The judgments are affirmed  except that the judgment of\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n86    To the  extent Brandon  also  challenges the  $50 statutory\nassessment  fee imposed  for each count  (totaling $1300)  by the\ndistrict court pursuant to  18 U.S.C.   3013,  we find no  error.\nThe assessment fee is  mandatory; the judge has no  discretion to\nwaive  it based on  the defendant's ability  to pay  nor does the\nConstitution require him to do so.

BACKGROUND\n\n          This  case involves  an alleged  scheme to  obtain loan\n\nfinancing   from  a   federally  insured  bank   by  fraudulently\n\nrepresenting the existence of down payments required  by the bank\n\nfrom  the   investors  on  whose  behalf  the  loans  were  made.\n\nAccording to  the record in this  case, viewed in the  light most\n\nfavorable to  the government,  United States v.  Van Helden,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552334\"><a href=\"/opinion/552334/united-states-v-caroline-elisa-van-helden/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span>\n                                                           \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  101 (1st Cir.  1990), the facts  of this scheme  are as\n\nfollows.\n\n          On  January 1,  1985, defendant  Peter Brandon  and two\n\nothers formed a partnership called Dean Street Development (\"Dean\n\nStreet\")1  for the  purpose  of buying,  developing, and  selling\n\nreal estate.  Specifically, Brandon  planned to buy and  renovate\n\n                    \n\n1  Several partnerships  and corporations related to  Dean Street\nwere  also involved in this case.  Together they are collectively\nreferred to here as \"Dean Street.\"  Brandon controlled all of the\nvarious entities.\n\n                               -5-\n\nmotels  along  the  Rhode  Island  seashore,  convert  them  into\n\ncondominiums and then  sell the individual rooms  to investors as\n\ncondominium  units.  As part of this plan, the condominium buyers\n\nwould lease the units  back to Dean Street and  Dean Street would\n\nthen  manage the properties  as motels.   Under  the \"lease-back\"\n\nagreement  with the  buyers, Dean  Street would apply  the income\n\nfrom the operation of  the motels to cover the  monthly mortgage,\n\ntax  and  insurance  costs incurred  by  the  unit  buyers.   Any\n\nshortfalls  in operating costs would  be made up  by Dean Street,\n\nleaving the buyers with no monthly costs on their investment.\n\n          In addition, buyers would be allowed to use their units\n\nfor two weeks  out of the year.  Dean  Street would also guaranty\n\nthem  a  certain level  of profit  at  sale.   Some  buyers would\n\nreceive  rebates for  each unit  they purchased.   In  short, the\n\nbuyers would be offered a sweet deal.\n\n          To  make  the deal  even  sweeter,  Brandon planned  to\n\narrange all  the financing for  the buyers.   He hoped  to obtain\n\n100% financing, that is, loans for the complete purchase price of\n\neach  unit.   With  such financing,  buyers  could invest  in the\n\nproject without  putting any  money down and  consequently obtain\n\nthat elusive  -- yet apparently  not uncommon for  the fast-paced\n\nworld of 1980s real estate -- deal of \"something for nothing.\" \n\n          In  early 1987, Brandon  approached Homeowner's Funding\n\nCorporation  (\"Homeowners\"), a  mortgage broker  that acts  as an\n\nintermediary between  banks and  borrowers, to obtain  these \"end\n\nloans\" for the  buyers.  Homeowners' President told  Brandon that\n\n                               -6-\n\n100% financing was unavailable for the project.  Rather, the best\n\nBrandon could  hope to  find was  80% financing  with a 20%  down\n\npayment  required  from  the  buyers.    Homeowners  subsequently\n\nsearched  for  a lender  and,  after  approaching several  banks,\n\nlocated  Bay Loan and  Investment Bank (\"Bay  Loan\"), a financial\n\ninstitution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nBay Loan agreed to lend buyers of Dean Street's condominium units\n\nup to 80% of the required purchase price.\n\n          Homeowners, as well  as East-West Financial Corporation\n\n(\"East West\"), the other mortgage broker involved in this  case,2\n\nacted as brokers and servicing agents for Bay Loan.  Bay Loan was\n\nthe actual lender  for the  Dean Street project  and it  financed\n\nevery  condominium  sale  involved  in  the  scheme.    By  prior\n\nagreement,  Homeowners   and  East  West  provided  the  original\n\nmortgages  for the  buyers  and  then  sold  them  to  Bay  Loan.\n\nHomeowners and East West would forward  all the loan applications\n\nto Bay Loan for approval prior to providing the mortgages for the\n\ncondominium  units.3     The  decision  of  whether   to  fund  a\n\nparticular mortgage rested  entirely with Bay  Loan and Bay  Loan\n\n                    \n\n2   Toward the end of 1987, Brandon became dissatisfied with what\nhe considered  the slow pace  at which Homeowners  was processing\nthe  loans and,  after a  dispute  with Homeowners,  retained the\nservices  of  East  West to  continue  the  project.   East  West\ncontinued where Homeowners left off  with Bay Loan again agreeing\nto act as the end loan financier.\n\n3   The brokers  would not  provide the  financing to the  buyers\nwithout first getting  Bay Loan's agreement to  purchase and fund\nthe loans.  In fact, Homeowner's line of credit for issuing funds\nto the  buyers specifically prohibited the  disbursement of money\nwithout  a commitment from the ultimate lender, in this case, Bay\nLoan, to fund the loan.\n\n                               -7-\n\nset the terms and conditions of each mortgage.\n\n          As Bay Loan Vice  President of consumer lending, Joseph\n\nGormley,  explained to Brandon, the bank required each buyer of a\n\ncondominium unit  to make  at least  a  20% down  payment to  the\n\nseller,  Dean  Street,  before  Bay Loan  could  fund  the loans.\n\nInstead  of  instructing  buyers  to provide  the  required  down\n\npayments,  however,  Brandon  concocted a  scheme  that permitted\n\nbuyers to  avoid the down payments  altogether.  As a  result, he\n\nwas  able to pursue his original goal of obtaining 100% financing\n\nfor the condominium  project.  The  scheme was formulated  during\n\nthe  spring  and   summer  of  1987  when   Brandon  had  several\n\ndiscussions  with,  among  other  people,  his  attorney,  George\n\nMarderosian,   and   co-defendant  Norman   Reisch,   another  of\n\nMarderosian's clients, concerning ways  that the 20% down payment\n\nrequirement \"might  be satisfied by alternative  methods or might\n\nbe  avoided.\"   During  that  period, Brandon  also  told another\n\nperson  involved in the conspiracy, Claude Limoges, that the down\n\npayments would be falsified.\n\n          Brandon  planned and  employed  three basic  methods of\n\nfalsifying  the  down payments.    The  first method  was  simply\n\nproviding money to the various buyers which the buyers would then\n\nuse to make the down payments to Dean Street.   Usually the money\n\ncame  from  third-party  investors  to whom  Brandon  promised  a\n\ncommission for each  down payment  they funded.   Once the  buyer\n\nmade  the down payment to  Dean Street, Dean  Street would return\n\nthe  money to  the  investor leaving  a  paper trail  for  a down\n\n                               -8-\n\npayment that was never actually made.  The second method involved\n\nobtaining down payment  checks from the buyers  and promising not\n\nto  cash them.  Copies of these nonnegotiated checks would remain\n\nin the  loan file  to give  the  appearance that  real funds  had\n\nactually been  transferred.   The  third  method was  to  provide\n\nsecond  mortgages to the buyers  to fund their  down payments and\n\nthen to discharge those mortgages after the closings.4\n\n          The first method of avoiding down payments was employed\n\nfrom  the outset of the scheme.  Co-defendants Charles Gauvin and\n\nMarvin Granoff,  two clients of Marderosian,  agreed with Brandon\n\nto purchase some units at the Charlestown  Motor Inn.  Gauvin and\n\nGranoff also agreed to provide down payment funds to other buyers\n\nfor  subsequent unit sales.  Brandon promised them $1000 for each\n\nunit  sold with their  down payment  funds.   In August  of 1987,\n\nGauvin,  Granoff and  a third  person each purchased  four units.\n\nMarderosian conducted the closing  and co-defendant Owen Landman,\n\nan  attorney who shared  office space with  Marderosian, acted as\n\nescrow  agent.   During  the  closing,  Marderosian recorded  the\n\namount of each down payment ($20,500) on the closing statements -\n\n- also called the HUD settlement sheets -- as \"amounts paid by or\n\nin behalf of borrower.\"5\n\n          Gauvin provided the down payment funds for these twelve\n\n                    \n\n4   Brandon also  falsified the  loan  applications of  otherwise\nunqualified buyers.\n\n5   Throughout the project, the HUD settlement sheets were signed\nby  Brandon  and  the  buyers,  including  those  defendants  who\npurchased units.\n\n                               -9-\n\npurchases but no actual payment was ever made; instead, the funds\n\nwere  passed through Dean Street and returned  to Gauvin.  At the\n\nclosing, Gauvin delivered twelve separate checks for $20,500 each\n\nto Marderosian, drawn on an account that only had a $6000 balance\n\nat  the  time, and  Landman deposited  the  checks in  his escrow\n\naccount.    Landman then  wrote  twelve  corresponding checks  to\n\nMarderosian who in turn wrote checks to Dean Street for identical\n\namounts  of  $20,500 each.   Two  days  later, Dean  Street wrote\n\ntwelve checks back to Gauvin for the same amounts of $20,500 each\n\nand Gauvin  deposited the money in the  original checking account\n\nto  cover his initial twelve  checks written as  down payments to\n\nthe seller.\n\n          In late  August and September of  1987, Gauvin provided\n\ndown  payments for the purchase of units at the Charlestown Motor\n\nInn and at the  Bayside Motel by Reisch and others.   As with the\n\nfirst  purchases, Dean  Street  returned the  down payment  money\n\nwithin a matter of days and also paid Gauvin  an additional $1000\n\nper unit.\n\n          In the beginning of 1988, Bay Loan began requiring that\n\ndown payments be made  with certified funds.  Gauvin  and Granoff\n\nagreed to provide  buyers with  funds so that  they could  obtain\n\ncertified checks before the closings.  In January and February of\n\n1988, Granoff supplied $470,000  to Marderosian who deposited the\n\nfunds  and began  distributing the  money to  prospective buyers.\n\nThe  original intention was that  Dean Street would  pay back the\n\nmoney to Granoff a few days after  each closing as it had done in\n\n                               -10-\n\nthe previous transactions.   Brandon, however, never returned the\n\nmoney as planned.6 \n\n          With  no more  money  coming from  Gauvin and  Granoff,\n\nBrandon discussed the possibility  of funding buyer down payments\n\nwith  Reisch.  Reisch had earlier supplied down payment money for\n\na buyer and  was reimbursed by Dean Street the  next day.  Reisch\n\nagreed to provide the money, but only if he could  wire the money\n\ndirectly to the buyers  on a transaction by transaction  basis in\n\norder  to avoid  having large  amounts outstanding.   Funds  were\n\nwired  to buyers on several  occasions and the  buyers then wrote\n\ndown  payment  checks with  the money.    The checks  were either\n\ndeposited in  Landman's escrow account or  endorsed directly back\n\nover  to Reisch.  Those  funds deposited in  escrow were promptly\n\nreturned to Reisch.\n\n          The second  method of  falsifying down  payments, using\n\nnonnegotiated checks,  was employed less frequently.   In October\n\nof 1987,  co-defendants Ronald  Hagopian and John  Ward purchased\n\nseveral units at the Bayside Motel using nonnegotiated checks for\n\ntheir down payments.   Brandon also  enlisted Hagopian and  Ward,\n\nboth  real  estate  brokers,  to solicit  other  buyers  for  the\n\nproject.  Hagopian and Ward told  several of the buyers they  had\n\nrecruited  to provide  down  payment checks  which they  promised\n\nwould never be cashed.  These buyers proceeded to write checks to\n\nDean Street and those checks were never negotiated. \n\n                    \n\n6   Brandon  did eventually  agree to  a repayment  schedule but,\nultimately, none of Granoff's money was ever repaid.\n\n                               -11-\n\n          The  third  method  of  falsifying  down  payments  was\n\nthrough  dischargeable mortgages.    Joseph Gormley  at Bay  Loan\n\napproved a  plan  for buyers  to make  only 5%  down payments  in\n\ncertified funds with the  balance of a required 25%  down payment\n\nto be satisfied  by a  second mortgage provided  by Dean  Street.\n\nDean Street  began providing these  mortgages to the  buyers, but\n\nthe  mortgages  were  promptly  discharged7  after  the  closings\n\nbecause  Dean  Street never  actually  intended  to obligate  the\n\nbuyers.   The discharges were  accomplished by a  \"purchase price\n\nadjustment\" given  to buyers after the sale  to \"compensate\" them\n\nfor promised renovations that Dean  Street was suddenly unable to\n\nmake.  In reality,  the renovations \"were never going  to happen\"\n\nin the first place.\n\n          At the closings, some of the buyers  inquired about the\n\nsecond  mortgage   documents  because  Brandon  had   promised  a\n\ndischarge  and the  buyers wanted  to know  when that  would take\n\nplace.   The \"purchase price adjustment\"  letters that discharged\n\nthe mortgages were excluded from the closing documentation so the\n\nbank would not see  them.  During the closings,  Landman gestured\n\nto several buyers that they should not mention the matter to him.\n\nBrandon's assistant  at Dean  Street, co-defendant Momi  Kumalae,\n\ndid  speak to buyers about  the discharges and  assured them that\n\nthey  would be taken  care of.   Kumalae also signed  many of the\n\n                    \n\n7   Testimony was offered  by defendants  to the effect  that the\ndischarges provided  by Dean Street were  not legally enforceable\nand that the  buyers are still  obligated on the  mortgages.   We\nfind this  possibility irrelevant  as the intent  was clearly  to\ndischarge the mortgages.\n\n                               -12-\n\ndischarge letters sent to the buyers.\n\n          Despite  the sale of almost  200 units, by  the fall of\n\n1988,  the  loan  proceeds  from  Bay  Loan's  financing of  unit\n\npurchases was falling  well short of  Dean Street's expenses  and\n\nits own debt service.   Dean Street quickly fell  behind schedule\n\nin making the mortgage  payments on all the Bay  Loan condominium\n\nunit  loans,  and it  eventually stopped  making any  payments by\n\nearly 1989. \n\n          Between August  1987 and October 1988,  Dean Street had\n\nsold 196 units to 79 different  buyers, all financed by Bay  Loan\n\nin  176 separate loans.   The face  value of the  loans was $18.8\n\nmillion  and  Bay  Loan  actually distributed  $17.3  million  to\n\nMarderosian who passed on about $16.9 million to Dean Street (the\n\nbalance  was retained as  fees or was paid  to Landman for escrow\n\nservices).  As of the trial, approximately $16.3 million remained\n\noutstanding on the loans.\n\n          Gormley  at Bay Loan,  who approved the  loans, did not\n\nknow that down  payment funds  came from sources  other than  the\n\nbuyers, that  some down payments were  nonnegotiated checks, that\n\nsecond mortgages were being discharged, or that buyers were being\n\npaid to purchase units.  Gormley testified that he would not have\n\napproved  the  loans  if  he  had  been aware  of  any  of  these\n\ncircumstances.\n\n          On February 28, 1991,  a federal grand jury sitting  in\n\nthe District of  Rhode Island handed  down a 27-count  indictment\n\ncharging the eight appellants and four others with defrauding Bay\n\n                               -13-\n\nLoan, a federally insured financial institution, of approximately\n\n$18  million.    Count  1  charged  all  twelve  defendants  with\n\nconspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of  18 U.S.C.   371.\n\nCounts 2  through 27  charged various defendants  with individual\n\nacts of bank  fraud, under 18 U.S.C.   1344,  based on individual\n\nloan transactions executed during  the scheme to defraud.8   Four\n\nof the defendants pleaded guilty and did not go to trial.  Two of\n\nthe four,  George Marderosian  and Claude Limoges,  testified for\n\nthe government.  \n\n          After a  trial in the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode  Island, the jury found all  the defendants\n\nguilty of conspiracy and each defendant guilty on multiple counts\n\nof bank fraud.  Some defendants were acquitted on individual bank\n\nfraud charges as discussed below.  This appeal followed. \n\n        II.  FAILURE OF THE INDICTMENT TO STATE AN OFFENSE\n\n          Defendants first  argue that  the indictment  failed to\n\nstate  an offense with respect to the conspiracy count because it\n\ndid not allege that the United  States or one of its agencies was\n\nthe target of the conspiracy.   Count I of the indictment charged\n\ndefendants  with  conspiring to  commit  an  offense against  the\n\n                    \n\n8  One bank fraud count was later dismissed by  the government so\nthat 26  total counts remained  for trial.  Brandon  was the only\ndefendant charged in all of the counts.\n\n   Each  bank fraud count charges  one or more  of the defendants\nwith facilitating  in some  way the fraudulent  representation of\nthe required down payment  for a specific loan for  an individual\ncondominium unit.  Although each unit purchase allegedly involved\nthe  same fraudulent scheme,  only 26 specific  executions of the\nscheme were originally charged.\n\n                               -14-\n\nUnited States  in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    371  by executing  a\n\nscheme to defraud Bay Loan  under 18 U.S.C.   1344.   Section 371\n\nmakes  it a  crime  to \"conspire  either  to commit  any  offense\n                                        \n\nagainst  the United States, or  to defraud the  United States, or\n                              \n\nany  agency thereof\" (emphasis added).

We think that this position is the correct one when the\n\nscheme  is viewed  properly from  an objective  standpoint.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLilly,  983  F.2d  at 303  (finding  that  the  scheme should  be\n     \n\n\"objectively viewed\" to determine multiplicity).\n\n          The  basic  scheme to  defraud  Bay  Loan involved  the\n\nfraudulent representation  of buyers'  down payments in  order to\n\n                               -17-\n\nobtain loan financing from the bank for Dean Street's condominium\n\nunits.  The  scheme was not  designed to get  a set amount,  or a\n\npreconceived sum,  of money.   Instead, the scheme  functioned by\n\nobtaining  as many loans as  possible depending on  the number of\n\nbuyers Dean Street could recruit to apply for the mortgages.  The\n\nstructure  of the scheme was such that individual buyers would be\n\nbrought in to  submit separate loan  applications which would  be\n\nfraudulently prepared and then  sent on to Bay Loan  for approval\n\nand the disbursement of the funds for that individual sale.   Bay\n\nLoan  approved  each loan  separately  based  on each  individual\n\napplication and each loan corresponded  to an individual piece of\n\nproperty,  that is,  a  separate condominium  unit.   Objectively\n\nviewed, each loan  application appears to be a repeated execution\n\nof the basic scheme and not simply an additional step or stage of\n\none  unitary transaction.  Although only one bank was involved in\n\nthe  scheme, there were over  176 separate loans  to 79 different\n\nbuyers involving many  separate movements of money from  Bay Loan\n\nto the mortgage  brokers and  from the mortgage  brokers to  Dean\n\nStreet  during  the fifteen  months in  which  the scheme  was in\n\noperation.\n\n          The fact that the end loans were sometimes processed in\n\nbulk  does  not   alter  the  essential  nature  of  the  scheme.\n\nDefendants highlight the fact that, on some  occasions, groups of\n\nmortgage applications  were supplied to Bay Loan together and Bay\n\nLoan sometimes wired money to the brokers on a bulk  basis.  This\n\nwas  usually done, however, as  a matter of  convenience (such as\n\n                               -18-\n\nwhen several unit purchases closed at the same time) and not as a\n\nmethod  to package the financing in a way necessary to accomplish\n\na unified  scheme.9   Arguably,  one could  view this  case as  a\n\nsingle  execution by Dean Street of a broad scheme to use various\n\nbuyers as  fronts in order to  get financing for a  unitary motel\n\ncondominium project.   However, we  feel it makes  more sense  to\n\nlook at each  mortgage application  as an  individual attempt  to\n\nfraudulently obtain distinct amounts of money from Bay Loan.\n\n          This is not, as defendants assert, a situation like the\n\none in Lilly where  a group of fraudulent mortgages  was assigned\n            \n\nin  a  single  package of  documents  to  the  defrauded bank  as\n\nsecurity for  one sum  of money used  to buy  a single  apartment\n\ncomplex.   See id.  at  302-305.   In that  case,  there was  one\n                 \n\ntransaction with the defrauded bank which was  executed \"in order\n\nto  obtain a single loan,  the proceeds of  which funded a single\n\nreal estate purchase.\"   Id. at 303.  Consequently,  we found the\n                           \n\ncharges based on each mortgage to be multiplicitous.  The present\n\ncase is more akin to a check kiting scheme which we characterized\n\nin Lilly as involving multiple executions of a fraudulent  scheme\n        \n\nbecause  more than  one bank  was involved  and because,  \"[m]ore\n\n                    \n\n9   At one point, Brandon  could not guaranty clear  title to Bay\nLoan  on the  condominium units  until he  sold enough  units and\nobtained a large enough chunk of financing to pay off some of the\noriginal mortgages used  to buy  the motels in  the first  place.\nThis did necessitate  bulk processing of  unit mortgages so  that\nblocks of financing could be obtained at one time.  The execution\nof  the   fraud,  however,  still  remained   the  submission  of\nindividual loan applications as additional buyers were recruited.\nThe block processing of loans did not correspond to one  loan for\neach motel but  were instead an amalgamation of  individual loans\nfor individual condominium units.\n\n                               -19-\n\nimportantly,   each  check   signifies  a   separate  transaction\n\nrequiring  a separate issuance of money or  credit on the part of\n\nthe victimized bank.\" Id. at 304.\n                        \n\n          Similarly, the  other  cases cited  by defendants  that\n\ninvalidate indictments on grounds of multiplicity involve  single\n\nloan  transactions instead  of  the multiple  and separate  loans\n\nfraudulently obtained in this  case.  See United States  v. Saks,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583901\"><a href=\"/opinion/583901/united-states-v-david-m-saks-united-states-of-america-v-james-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1526 (5th Cir. 1992) (single loan transaction for\n\nsingle piece of property); United States v.

We hold, therefore, that  each end\n\nloan provided by Bay Loan was the result of a separate fraud upon\n\nthe bank which  the indictment properly charged  as an individual\n\nbank fraud offense.\n\n                 IV.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Seven of  the eight defendants argue  that the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial was insufficient to support their convictions\n\nfor  bank  fraud and  conspiracy to  commit  bank fraud.10   They\n\n                    \n\n10   Brandon does not  challenge the sufficiency  of the evidence\nagainst  him on appeal.   He does argue  that certain evidentiary\nrulings deprived him  of a fair  trial because he  was unable  to\npresent his  theory of  the case  and  convince the  jury of  his\ninnocence.   This issue  is discussed below  in Section VII.   We\n\n                               -20-\n\nargue,  with individual  variations, that they  did not  have the\n\nrequisite knowledge and  intent to defraud Bay  Loan because they\n\ndid  not  know  of,  or  intend  to  violate,  any  down  payment\n\nrequirements of  the bank.   With  the few exceptions  previously\n\nnoted, we disagree.  Before  reviewing the evidence with  respect\n\nto each  defendant, we must  first address some  issues regarding\n\nthe substantive offenses charged in this case.\n\n                         A.  The Offenses\n\n                          1.  Bank Fraud\n\n          To  prove  bank fraud  under  18 U.S.C.     1344,11 the\n\nprosecution  must  show  beyond   a  reasonable  doubt  that  the\n\ndefendant (1) engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or made\n\n                    \n\nnote for the record that the evidence against Brandon is not only\nsufficient but overwhelming.\n\n11   At the  time when  the offenses occurred,  18 U.S.C.    1344\nprovided:\n\n            Whoever  knowingly executes,  or attempts\n            to execute, a  scheme or artifice --  (1)\n            to  defraud  a  federally   chartered  or\n            insured financial institution; or  (2) to\n            obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits,\n            assets,  securities,  or  other  property\n            owned by, or under the custody or control\n            of  a  federally  chartered   or  insured\n            financial institution, by means  of false\n            or fraudulent pretenses, representations,\n            or  promises;  [shall  be  guilty  of  an\n            offense against the United States].\n\n   A  technical amendment  in 1989  deleted the  words \"federally\nchartered or  insured\" from  the section leaving  just \"financial\ninstitution.\"  Pub. L.  No. 101-73, Title IX,    961(k), Aug.  9,\n1989,  103 Stat.  500.   Apparently,  no  substantive change  was\nintended  by  this  amendment  as the  definition  of  \"financial\ninstitution\" for all  of Title 18,  now contained at 18  U.S.C.  \n20,   still   encompasses   federally   chartered    or   insured\ninstitutions.\n\n                               -21-\n\nfalse statements or misrepresentations  to obtain money from; (2)\n\na  federally  insured  financial  institution;  and  (3)  did  so\n\nknowingly.

That is not  the case  with the bank  fraud\n\nstatute  because \"knowingly\"  in    1344  clearly applies  to the\n\n                    \n\n13  We find the language of   1014 sufficiently similar to   1344\nto  warrant  a similar  conclusion  about  Congress' intent  with\nrespect to the knowledge  requirement in the bank fraud  statute.\n18 U.S.C.   1014 states in pertinent part:\n\n            \"Whoever   knowingly   makes  any   false\n            statement   or   report,   or   willfully\n            overvalues   any    land,   property   or\n            security, for the purpose  of influencing\n            in  any  way  the  action of  .  .  . any\n            institution  the  accounts  of which  are\n            insured by the Federal  Deposit Insurance\n            Corporation  [shall  be   guilty  of   an\n            offense against the Unites States].\"\n\n   Defendants contend that the use of \"knowingly\" in this statute\ndiffers  significantly from  its use  in    1344  which prohibits\nknowingly executing a scheme \"to defraud a federally chartered or\ninsured financial institution.\"  We reject this  contention.  The\nplacement in   1344 of the words \"federally chartered or insured\"\nbefore the  word \"institution\" instead of  similar language being\nplaced after  \"institution,\" as  in    1014, simply  reflects the\nfact  that federal  insurance  is separately  defined in  another\nsubsection  and thus  there is no  need to  use the  more awkward\nconstruction  found in   1014.  The different word placement is a\ndistinction without a difference.\n\n                               -25-\n\nexecution  of  a  scheme  or  artifice  to  defraud.    The  word\n\n\"knowingly\" is necessary because one can execute a scheme without\n\nknowing or understanding that it is fraudulent.  In fact, that is\n\nwhat many of the defendants themselves argue in this appeal: that\n\nthey  may have facilitated the  false down payments  but they did\n\nnot  know  it  violated  the  bank's  requirements.    Therefore,\n\n\"knowingly\" in    1344 has independent  meaning without reference\n\nto the federally insured status of the financial institution.\n\n          The  defendants  in  this  case  also  argue  that  the\n\ngovernment  must prove they knew that the end loans were provided\n\nby Bay Loan and not by some other institution, such as Homeowners\n\nor East West.  In other words,  there was no violation of    1344\n\nbecause the scheme  to defraud  was not knowingly  targeted at  a\n\nfederally insured financial institution,  but instead at the non-\n\nfederally insured mortgage brokers.\n\n          Defendants  overstate the  government's  burden.    The\n\nspecific intent under   1344 is an intent to defraud a bank, that\n\nis, an  intent to  victimize  a bank  by  means of  a  fraudulent\n\nscheme.  See United States v.

Bay Loan was  in fact victimized\nby  defendants' scheme to defraud.   In addition,  the scheme was\ndesigned  to  obtain  funds  from  Bay  Loan  in   particular  by\nfraudulently  avoiding one of Bay Loan's requirements.

We reject\n\nthis  attempt  to escape  the reach  of  the bank  fraud statute.\n\nInstead, we find that  defendants need not have had  the specific\n\nintent to defraud  Bay Loan so long  as they intended to  defraud\n\nsome financial institution.   The  fact that it  should turn  out\n\nthat the financial  institution actually defrauded  was federally\n\ninsured is a fortuitous stroke of bad luck for the defendants but\n\ndoes  not make it  any less  of a federal  crime.   In this case,\n\nevidence beyond  a reasonable doubt that  defendants fraudulently\n\nevaded  a known down  payment requirement, whether  thought to be\n\nimposed  by  Homeowners,  East  West,  Bay  Loan  or  some  other\n\nfinancing  entity,   is  sufficient  to  support   a  bank  fraud\n\nconviction.  Of course, the government must also establish that a\n\nfederally  insured bank, Bay Loan, was victimized or exposed to a\n\nrisk  of loss  by the scheme  to defraud.

Financial\n\ntransactions are becoming increasingly integrated and  complex as\n\nmore and more financial instruments are securitized and traded on\n\nnational  and  global  markets.   Consequently,  the  effects  of\n\nfraudulent  actions  against  one  institution  are  increasingly\n\nlikely to  spill  over  and  detrimentally  affect  others.    As\n\nCongress'  main concern in   1344 was to provide jurisdiction for\n\nfraudulent  schemes  that harmed  federally chartered  or insured\n\ninstitutions, the  increased risks to the  institutions should be\n\nmatched  by  increased  coverage of  the  statute.    We are  not\n\nfederalizing  criminal  transactions previously  covered  only by\n\nstate law so much as recognizing that those criminal transactions\n\n                    \n\nby increasing the equity participation of the borrower and giving\nthe borrower  a larger stake in  the venture.  The  down payments\nconsequently have value  to the  lender bank and  the failure  to\nmake them deprives the bank  of this value.  Cf. Mason,  902 F.2d\n                                                      \nat 1441-43  (finding  intent  to commit  bank  fraud  where  bank\nexposed to risk of loss  through defendants' concealment from the\nbank that its customers were purchasing prostitution services and\nconsequently were a  greater credit  risk to the  bank which  was\nprocessing the customers' credit  card purchases from defendants'\nescort service).\n\n   The fact that buyers were required to make their down payments\nto the seller, Dean Street, does not mitigate the risk of loss to\nBay Loan  from the down payment  scheme.  There would  still be a\nhigher risk  of default and  the absence of  equity participation\nregardless  of who was receiving, or failing to receive, the down\npayments.  In addition, the value of the condominiums, the bank's\ncollateral,  becomes an issue where the bank, thinking it is only\nproviding  80% of the purchase price, is actually lending 100% of\nthe sale price.   Ultimately,  Bay Loan refused  to provide  100%\nfinancing  and explicitly  required a  down payment;  the payment\nbecame  a negotiated term of  the mortgage contract  and thus had\nsome value to Bay Loan.\n\n                               -29-\n\nare becoming more federal in nature.16\n\n          An  additional argument  defendants  make  is that  the\n\ngovernment  must  prove  defendants  knew that  Bay  Loan's  down\n\npayment   requirement  specifically  prohibited  the  funding  of\n\nbuyers'  down   payments  by   someone  other  than   the  buyer.\n\nDefendants claim  that they  thought the  funding  of buyer  down\n\npayments   was   just   some   complex   financial   arrangement,\n\n\"supplemental financing\" or required  paperwork, and they did not\n\nknow the funding was designed to defraud the bank.\n\n          This misrepresents  the nature of the  fraud.  Although\n\nBay  Loan  did  in fact  prohibit  third  party  funding of  down\n\npayments, the  key misrepresentation in  this case  was that  the\n\nrequired down payments  were being paid  when they actually  were\n\nnot.  Bay Loan required  the buyers to make down payments  to the\n\nseller,  Dean  Street,  and the  existence  of  the  payments was\n\nrepresented to the  bank on  the closing settlement  sheets.   In\n\nreality,  the payments  were not  being  made, either  because no\n\nfunds  were  actually  transferred  or  because  the  funds  were\n\n                    \n\n16  We do not  address whether any scheme to defraud,  regardless\nof  its intended victim, can  be prosecuted under  the bank fraud\nstatute  as long as it has some detrimental effect on a federally\ninsured bank.   In this case at  least, the government  did prove\nthe  scheme  was intended  to  defraud  a financial  institution:\nHomeowners or East West, if not Bay Loan itself.\n\n   We also  do not  address possible statutory  or jurisdictional\nlimitations on the  remoteness or foreseeability  of the harm  or\nthe  risk of  loss  to federally  insured financial  institutions\nbeyond which    1344 will no  longer apply.  We  simply note that\nthis  case  presents  a situation  of  direct  harm  to Bay  Loan\nresulting  from a  scheme specifically  designed to  fraudulently\navoid the requirements of that federally insured bank in order to\nobtain funds originating directly from Bay Loan.\n\n                               -30-\n\nreturned  by Dean  Street  to  their  source.17   Therefore,  the\n\ngovernment need  only prove that  defendants knew a  down payment\n\nwas required and that  no real down payments were  actually made.\n\nIt need not establish  that defendants knew all of  the specifics\n\nof  the down payment  requirement such  as restrictions  on third\n\nparty funding.\n\n          In sum,  to prove  defendants knowingly engaged  in the\n\nfraud,  the government  must establish  that each  defendant knew\n\nthat some  financial institution  was lending  the money  for the\n\nmotel-condominium project, knew that  a down payment was required\n\nfor  these  loans, knew  that  a scheme  of one  sort  or another\n\nexisted to make it appear that the down payments were being  made\n\nwhen  in fact  they were  not, and  finally, that  each defendant\n\nwillfully participated in that scheme.\n\n                          2.  Conspiracy\n\n          Each defendant contests the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nof his or her knowledge of the conspiracy to defraud Bay Loan and\n\nhis or her level of participation in that agreed upon scheme.  To\n\nprove conspiracy, the  government must show  the existence of  an\n\nagreement  between defendant  and  another to  commit a  crime,18\n\n                    \n\n17  In those cases where Dean Street failed to repay down payment\nfunds  as  promised, the  intention  was still  to do  so  and to\nexecute the same fraud as was executed on the other unit sales.\n\n18  To the extent that the existence of a conspiracy is at issue,\nthe  evidence is  overwhelming  to support  the  convictions.   A\nconspiracy is an agreement to commit  a crime and may be inferred\nfrom  the circumstances.  United States v.

Below, we review each defendant's  case\n\nindividually.\n\n                        1.  Marvin Granoff\n\n          Granoff was  convicted of conspiracy and  two counts of\n\nbank  fraud in  connection  with his  purchase  of units  on  one\n\noccasion and with his  funding of buyer down payments  on another\n\noccasion.    Granoff argues  that the  evidence  in this  case is\n\ninsufficient to show that  he was anything more than  an innocent\n\ninvestor duped  by his lawyer, Marderosian,  into providing money\n\nfor a project  he really did not  know anything about.   Although\n\nthe evidence against Marvin  Granoff reveals a more circumscribed\n\nrole than some of  the other defendants,  we are not prepared  to\n\noverturn  the  jury's guilty  verdict  on  either the  conspiracy\n\ncharge or on the two counts of bank fraud.\n\n          Sufficient evidence supports the jury's conclusion that\n\nGranoff  knew  Bay Loan  was  funding  Dean Street's  condominium\n\nproject, that he knew down payments were required from the buyers\n\nand that he  knowingly participated  in a scheme  to deceive  the\n\nbank into thinking the requirement was satisfied.  To begin with,\n\nGranoff  bought four  units  on one  occasion  and provided  down\n\npayment  funds on another occasion.  Both times Bay Loan financed\n\nthe purchases without knowing the required down payments were not\n\nactually made.    Prior to  each of  these transactions,  Granoff\n\nattended a series of  meetings with Brandon concerning the  motel\n\ncondominium scheme.  Brandon told Granoff that down payments were\n\nrequired and that he needed Granoff to provide money for the down\n\n                               -34-\n\npayments of other buyers.19  Granoff agreed to do so.20\n\n          For Granoff's purchase of  units at the Charlestown Inn\n\n                    \n\n19  Specifically, Marderosian  testified that Brandon told Gauvin\nand Granoff in  the summer  of 1987 that  \"Homeowners required  a\ntwenty-five  percent down  payment  and while  that down  payment\nwould not  be required of Mr. Gauvin and Mr. Granoff, he did have\nthe problem of the down payment with subsequent purchasers and he\nasked  Mr. Gauvin and Mr. Granoff for their assistance in meeting\nthat problem.\"  Despite the offer to \"waive\" Gauvin and Granoff's\ndown payments,  checks representing  down payments were  required\nfor their purchases.\n\n   In  another meeting, Brandon asked  Gauvin and Granoff if they\nwere  \"willing  to  provide  the down  payment  money  for  other\npurchasers\" and they agreed to do so.  Marderosian also testified\nthat Brandon told Granoff at a meeting in January of 1988 that he\nneeded someone  to provide funding for the certified down payment\nfunds required  from unit buyers.   Brandon asked  whether Gauvin\nand Granoff were \"interested  in providing those certified funds\"\nand they agreed.\n\n20    Marderosian  testified   that  Granoff  agreed  on  several\ndifferent  occasions  to  participate  in  Brandon's  scheme  and\nreferred several  times  to the  \"agreement  Mr. Gauvin  and  Mr.\nGranoff  made to  provide Mr.  Brandon with  monies for  the down\npayments.\"    Despite  this, Granoff  argues  that  Marderosian's\ntestimony indicates Granoff said little or nothing at the various\nmeetings  with  Brandon and  this  is  insufficient to  establish\nGranoff agreed to participate  in the conspiracy.  The  fact that\nGranoff  provided  $470,000  that  was  used  for  down  payments\nfollowing the meetings  with Brandon in  which the agreement  was\ndiscussed, however, is sufficient  to support the conclusion that\nGranoff in fact did agree and did participate in the conspiracy.\n\n   Furthermore, Granoff's involvement in  the conspiracy was more\nthan just the  provision of  goods and services  to an  operation\nthat he knew might use the funds illegally.

Granoff's provision of down payment funds\nwas  a specialized  transaction without  loan documents  or other\npaperwork and did not constitute merely the provision of goods or\nservices to the conspiracy.   Overall, the evidence is  more than\nadequate to support the finding that Granoff adopted the goals of\nthe  conspiracy as his own and provided the down payment funds to\nfurther the conspiracy.\n\n                               -35-\n\nin August of 1987, his partner, Gauvin, provided down payments to\n\nDean  Street on Granoff's behalf in the  form of checks that were\n\nnot  backed by  sufficient  funds.   Copies  of the  checks  were\n\nincluded in the closing  files.  The \"payments\" were  returned to\n\nGauvin  two days later  when Dean  Street wrote  identical checks\n\nback to Gauvin which Gauvin deposited in his account to cover the\n\noriginal down payment  checks.   The fact  that Gauvin's  checks,\n\ntotalling $246,000, were drawn  on an account with only  $6000 at\n\nthe  time  when they  were written  indicates  that there  was no\n\nintent on  Gauvin's part  to make an  actual down payment  in the\n\nfirst place.21\n\n          Granoff likewise provided down payment funds for  other\n\nbuyers  and  the evidence  indicates  he  did  this  knowing  and\n\nexpecting  that  the money  would be  returned  to him  after the\n\nclosing.   Granoff provided  $470,000 for  down  payments on  the\n\n                    \n\n21   Granoff argues that  with respect to  Count 2,  charging him\nwith bank fraud in connection with his purchase of a  unit at the\nCharlestown Motor  Inn, the  requisite knowledge element  was not\nestablished.   Brandon  had told  Granoff that  the down  payment\nwould be waived for  his purchase and there was  nothing, Granoff\nclaims,  in  the  closing  procedure sufficient  to  support  the\nconclusion that he knew his  purchase took place under fraudulent\npretenses.   On the contrary, even if we disregard the reasonable\npossibility  that  Granoff's  partner, Gauvin,  told  Granoff all\nabout the complex recycling transaction Gauvin undertook with the\nchecks used  for Granoff's  down payment,  the fact that  Granoff\nsigned the  HUD settlement sheets establishes  a sufficient basis\nto  conclude Granoff knew  he was  representing the  existence of\ndown  payments  that  he  was  not  actually  paying.    The  HUD\nsettlement sheet for Granoff's purchases clearly indicated that a\n$20,500 down  payment was  being paid  by the  buyer.   If indeed\nGranoff was under the impression, up to that point, that the down\npayment  had been  \"waived,\"  the $20,500  figure on  the closing\ndocuments  must have tipped him off that something suspicious was\ngoing on.\n\n                               -36-\n\nAtlantic  Inn-Westerly units in the  form of two  checks, one for\n\n$270,000 from Marvin Granoff Real Estate and another for $200,000\n\nfrom Granoff's  Eastern  Wire  Products  Co.   In  turn,  Brandon\n\npromised  to pay Granoff $1000 for each unit sold using Granoff's\n\ndown payment money.\n\n          As it turns out,  Granoff was never paid back,  but the\n\nevidence shows that Granoff expected and  intended for this money\n\nto be promptly  returned to him after the closings.   A recycling\n\narrangement had been used earlier for Granoff's own purchase, and\n\nfor  subsequent purchases  funded  by Gauvin,  under the  initial\n\nagreement  between   Granoff,   Gauvin,  and   Brandon.      More\n\nimportantly, about  two weeks after the  first closings involving\n\nGranoff's  $470,000,   Gauvin sent  a letter  to  Marderosian, on\n\nManchester   Associates22   letterhead,   complaining  that   the\n\ntransaction involving  the $470,000  was taking  too  long.   The\n\nletter stated  that the transaction involving  Granoff's $470,000\n\n\"was  to take  at  most two  to  three days.\"   Marderosian  also\n\ntestified that  on a different occasion,  Gauvin told Marderosian\n\nthat  Gauvin and Granoff \"can  make money without  putting up any\n\nmoney.\"    In addition,  there was  no  promissory note  or other\n\nformal  documentation to  indicate that  the $470,000  was normal\n\nloan  financing.23   Consequently,  Granoff knew  that his  money\n\n                    \n\n22    Manchester  Associates  was  a  partnership  formed  by and\nconsisting of Gauvin and Granoff.\n\n23  Gauvin and Granoff documented a previous  loan to Brandon for\nthe smaller  sum  of  $200,000  indicating that  if  they  really\nintended the money  to be a loan  instead of a tool  to show down\npayments  through  a  recycling   transaction,  they  would  have\n\n                               -37-\n\nwas used to create  the appearance that down payments  were being\n\npaid when in fact they were not; they were being falsified.\n\n          The  arrangement of  rapidly  recycling \"down  payment\"\n\nfunds  through  Dean Street  meant  that,  in  reality,  no  down\n\npayments were  being made at all.  A  paper trail was left in the\n\nclosing files indicating that  the buyer had made a  down payment\n\nto  the seller,  Dean  Street, when,  in  fact, the  seller  just\n\nreturned  the money  to  its source,  effectively rendering  that\n\npaper trail fraudulent.  Bay  Loan's down payment requirement was\n\nthus  avoided  without  the  bank's  knowledge.    As  a  knowing\n\nparticipant  in  this  recycling  scheme,  Granoff possessed  the\n\nnecessary  intent   to  defraud   and  the  requisite   level  of\n\ninvolvement  in the larger conspiracy  to be found  guilty of the\n\noffenses charged.\n\n          Although   not   essential   for  upholding   Granoff's\n\nconviction,  we also find that the evidence is sufficient to show\n\nthat  Granoff knew  Bay  Loan  was  loaning  the  money  for  the\n\ncondominium units.   Granoff  bought four  units financed  by Bay\n\nLoan and he put up nearly half a million dollars  to provide down\n\npayment  funds  for other  units to  be  purchased with  Bay Loan\n\nfinancing.    Homeowners  furnished  a  letter  at  the  closings\n\nincluding  the  closing  on Granoff's  purchases,  which  Granoff\n\nattended,  stating that  Homeowners had  \"transferred all  of its\n\n                    \n\ndocumented it.\n\n                               -38-\n\nrights and interests\"  in the  mortgage to Bay  Loan.24   Granoff\n\nhad occasion  to see  the letter  and it  is not unreasonably  to\n\nassume he also read it.\n\n          Granoff also  attended  a number  of planning  meetings\n\nwith Brandon in  which plans  for closing on  various units,  the\n\nfunding  of down payments, and  other details of  the scheme were\n\ndiscussed.   The evidence also indicates  Granoff was continually\n\nkept  abreast of various detail of Brandon's scheme; details, one\n\ncould infer,  that included the source of  the financing.  In the\n\nlast half of 1987, Granoff and Gauvin formed a partnership called\n\nManchester Associates for the  purpose of real estate investment.\n\nOn behalf of Manchester Associates, Gauvin met several times with\n\nBrandon  who discussed  his overall  plans to  close on  over 400\n\nmotel units as well as the schedule for  those closings.  Letters\n\nreferencing these meetings were  written on Manchester letterhead\n\nand one could reasonably infer that  Gauvin related the substance\n\nof  the meetings to his partner  Granoff.25  One such letter from\n\n                    \n\n24   There is  some dispute  whether this  letter, which was  not\nsigned  by the parties, was  included among the  documents at the\nclosings.  Homeowners' Vice  President, Gregory Cambio, testified\nthat  the letter  \"was  part of  the  closing package\"  but  also\ntestified  that it  may have  been sent after  the closing.   The\ntrial exhibits  containing the loan  files for each  of Granoff's\npurchases do contain  the letter which is dated on  the same date\nas  the  closing.    However,  the  file  contains  both  closing\ndocuments, signed by Granoff, as well as other documents that may\nor may not have been  at the closing.  The letter,  therefore, is\nnot  dispositive of  Granoff's knowledge,  but does  provide some\nevidence of  knowledge that can be considered in conjunction with\nthe other circumstantial evidence.\n\n25  For example, Granoff was cc'd on a letter to Dean Street that\nreferenced  plans  to  close  on  107  units  and  discussed  the\nrepayment of Granoff's $470,000.\n\n                               -39-\n\nGauvin states  that \"it would seem that  the lending institutions\n\nwill be in a position  to begin closing.\"  As Homeowners  and Bay\n\nLoan were the only  institutions involved at the time  the letter\n\nwas written,  the  plural reference  to \"institutions\"  indicates\n                                                     \n\nthat  Gauvin and  his partner,  Granoff, were  aware not  only of\n\nHomeowners but of Bay Loan as well.\n\n          In sum, the evidence  indicates that Granoff was aware,\n\non a fairly  detailed level, of a large real  estate scheme whose\n\nonly source of funding happened to be Bay Loan.  With substantial\n\nsums of his own money at stake in this extensive project, Granoff\n\nwas likely to become aware  at some point of the source  of money\n\nbehind  it all.  It  is not unreasonable  to conclude, therefore,\n\nthat Granoff knew of Bay Loan's involvement in the project.\n\n          Furthermore, the  fact that Bay Loan  was providing the\n\nfinancing  was known  to several  others who, like  Granoff, were\n\ninvolved in buying and investing in the units.  Brandon testified\n\nthat he was \"completely open\" about, and \"made no secret\" of, Bay\n\nLoan's involvement.  Although Brandon testified that he generally\n\ntold people outside  Dean Street that  the lender was  Homeowners\n\nand not Bay Loan, he also testified that he told  Hagopian, Ward,\n\nReisch, and Limoges about Bay Loan's involvement.   These people,\n\nlike Granoff,  bought units  or provided  down payment funds  and\n\nwere not Dean Street  employees.  Even an investor  named Michael\n\nParvin, who bought only one unit, testified that he knew Bay Loan\n\nwas involved.  It is  not unreasonable, therefore, for a jury  to\n\nconclude that Granoff discovered this fact as well.\n\n                               -40-\n\n          Granoff challenges any inferences of criminal knowledge\n\nor  intent drawn  from  the pool  of  circumstantial evidence  as\n\nimpermissibly based merely on  Granoff's association with his co-\n\ndefendants.  He  claims that amidst  the fast-paced wheeling  and\n\ndealing of the 1980s  real estate market, investors did  not have\n\nthe ability to know all the details and purposes behind every one\n\nof  their transactions.  It  was common for  investors to entrust\n\ntheir money to developers and lawyers without learning any of the\n\nspecifics of  the various projects  in which they  were involved.\n\nDetails  such  as  the exact  nature  of  a  bank's down  payment\n\nrequirement  were not,  Granoff implies,  important enough  to be\n\ndiscussed  between a  developer and  an investor.   Add  to these\n\ncircumstances the unscrupulous and  deceptive acts of Brandon and\n\nMarderosian, who allegedly got Granoff into this  whole mess, and\n\nGranoff  contends that we cannot help but conclude he was lied to\n\nabout the true nature of the project.\n\n          While it  may  be true  that  the typical  real  estate\n\ninvestor  in the 1980s would readily put up hundreds of thousands\n\nof dollars for  \"down payment funds,\" expect the money  back in a\n\nfew days, and still not  suspect he is defrauding a bank,  we are\n\ncertainly  not  prepared, given  the  facts  discussed above,  to\n\npreclude  a jury from concluding  otherwise.  The government need\n\nnot disprove  every reasonable hypothesis of  innocence, provided\n\nthe record in its  entirety supports the jury's verdict.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Ct. 1005 (1993).   In this case, the  record does provide\n\n                               -41-\n\nthe   requisite  support.     Therefore,   we  affirm   Granoff's\n\nconvictions.\n\n                        2.  Charles Gauvin\n\n          Gauvin was  convicted of conspiracy and  five counts of\n\nbank fraud in connection  with his purchase of several  units and\n\nhis  funding of  buyer  down  payments.    Gauvin  was  Granoff's\n\nbusiness partner and the more active of the two in their dealings\n\nwith Dean Street.  According  to the record, he knew at  least as\n\nmuch  as Granoff,  and  most likely  more,  about the  scheme  to\n\ndefraud Bay Loan.   Gauvin also participated to a  greater extent\n\nin the scheme than  Granoff did.  Consequently, there is  no need\n\nto  discuss at  length  the evidence  sufficient  to support  his\n\nconviction.  \n\n          The jury could have found that Gauvin knew Bay Loan was\n\nproviding loans  for the  condominium project and  requiring down\n\npayments for these  loans based  on the evidence  of the  several\n\nmeetings  Gauvin  attended and  correspondence that  he exchanged\n\nwith   Brandon  discussing  the   condominium  projects  and  his\n\nagreement with Brandon to provide buyers with down payment  funds\n\nthat  were required  for the financing  of the  units.   The jury\n\ncould infer that Gauvin knew the  down payments were not in  fact\n\nbeing  paid  in violation  of  the bank's  requirement,  and that\n\nGauvin willfully  participated in  the scheme to  accomplish this\n\nfraud,  based on the evidence  that Gauvin: 1)  delivered to Dean\n\nStreet twelve  down payment  checks backed by  insufficient funds\n\nfor the  Charlestown  closings in  August  of 1987  and  received\n\n                               -42-\n\ntwelve  equivalent checks  back from Dean  Street two  days later\n\nwhich  he used  to cover  his original  checks; 2)  provided down\n\npayment money for  Reisch and  others which was  returned to  him\n\nwithin a matter  of days;  3) commented to  Marderosian that  the\n\ndown payment checks  he was providing \"did not have  to be backed\n\nby good  funds because the timing  was so quick\" and  that he and\n\nGranoff could \"make money  without putting up any money;\"  and 4)\n\ndelivered Granoff's $470,000 in down payment funds to Dean Street\n\nand wrote in a subsequent letter to Brandon that he  expected the\n\ntransaction involving those funds  \"to take at most two  to three\n\ndays.\"\n\n          Gauvin  argues  that  the  evidence  of  his activities\n\nclearly  indicates a lawful intent  in his writing  the checks to\n\nDean  Street.  As  he testified at  trial, Gauvin  thought he was\n\nsimply lending money to  Dean Street for its condominium  project\n\nand he  had no intention  that his  money be used  for fraudulent\n\npurposes.   Evidence in  the record indicates  that \"supplemental\n\nfinancing,\" similar  to what Gauvin  thought he was  providing to\n\nDean Street, was  a standard  practice in the  industry.   Gauvin\n\nalso  testified that he was  \"surprised\" to see  his first twelve\n\nchecks come back  so quickly.  But  Gauvin was not  so surprised,\n\napparently, so as to be tipped off that anything illegitimate was\n\ngoing  on because  such rapid  turn  around of  loans was  also a\n\nstandard  practice during  the  real estate  boom  of the  1980s.\n\nGauvin  suggests  that  maybe   Dean  Street  was  packaging  the\n\nsecondary financing and selling it off at a profit, thus removing\n\n                               -43-\n\nGauvin's participation as a lender fairly quickly. \n\n          Maybe, but then again, maybe  not.  The jury considered\n\nGauvin's arguments  and decided  that the evidence  proved Gauvin\n\nknew what was really happening at Dean Street.  Our job on appeal\n\nis to measure the sufficiency of  that evidence and not to search\n\nfor  every logical  or  rational conclusion  that  can be  drawn.\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 714.  Gauvin was told several times that funds\n     \n\nwere needed  to make down payments for buyers.  We find it rather\n\ndifficult,   therefore,  to   believe  Gauvin   thought  he   was\n\nlegitimately loaning  money for down payments  when the recipient\n\nof the payments  was giving the money  right back to the  lender.\n\nIf Gauvin loaned  money to a friend to buy a car and then had his\n\nloan paid off by  the car dealership, we  might wonder about  his\n\ncharacterization of the transaction as normal financing.   In the\n\npresent case, the suspicious nature of the transactions, combined\n\nwith  evidence  of  the  underlying  scheme  to  defraud  and  an\n\nagreement  between  Gauvin   and  the   scheme's  mastermind   to\n\ncontribute funds to the scheme, is more than ample to support the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n                        3.  Norman Reisch \n\n          Reisch was convicted of  conspiracy and seven counts of\n\nbank fraud.  The  evidence against Reisch indicates that  he knew\n\nBay Loan was financing  the condominium units, that he  knew down\n\npayments were  required for  the condominium  loans  and that  he\n\nknowingly  participated  in a  scheme  to  recycle funds  through\n\nbuyers to make  it look  like these down  payments were  actually\n\n                               -44-\n\nbeing  made.   Reisch  had \"at  least  a dozen\"  discussions with\n\nBrandon and  Marderosian about  the 20% down  payment requirement\n\nand ways that the \"requirement might be satisfied  by alternative\n\nmethods  or  might be  avoided,\"  including  the  use  of  second\n\nmortgages and loaning the down payment money to the buyers.\n\n          Proof   of  Reisch's   knowing  participation   in  the\n\nconspiracy is as follows.   Reisch bought four  Charlestown units\n\nfor which  Gauvin provided the down  payment funds.  At  the same\n\ntime, Reisch provided  another buyer with down  payment money for\n\nthree other units.   Dean Street returned the money to Reisch the\n\nnext day.   Reisch later agreed  with Brandon  to wire money  for\n\ndown payments directly into buyers' accounts.  After each closing\n\nthat utilized Reisch's  wired funds, the  down payment money  was\n\nreturned to Reisch.   On  some occasions, the  buyers' checks  to\n\nDean Street,  which were funded by Reisch, were endorsed directly\n\nback over to Reisch.  Reisch once remarked about this arrangement\n\n\"we  would just have to keep  bringing the funds back and rolling\n\nthem to wire more funds out for the projects.\"\n\n          As  for   Reisch's  knowledge  of   Bay  Loan,  Brandon\n\ntestified that it was  \"very probable\" that he told  Reisch about\n\nBay Loan's  involvement in the  project during a  conversation in\n\nthe  summer of  1988.   The jury  could reasonably  conclude that\n\nReisch had knowledge of Bay  Loan even before this  conversation.\n\nReisch's  contact with  Brandon and  his involvement in  the down\n\npayment  scheme  was  more  significant  than  that  of  Granoff.\n\nBecause we  found sufficient  evidence to support  the conclusion\n\n                               -45-\n\nthat Granoff had knowledge  of Bay Loan,  we think that, for  the\n\nreasons  discussed  above,  there  is  also  sufficient  evidence\n\nagainst Reisch. \n\n          Like Gauvin and Granoff, Reisch argues that he was just\n\nmaking  loans that he thought were completely legal.  Like Gauvin\n\nand Granoff, we find this argument unconvincing, especially given\n\nReisch's greater involvement in the scheme.  We reject, moreover,\n\nReisch's  application of the holding in United States v. Falcone,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1500782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1500782/united-states-v-falcone/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  581 (2d Cir.  1940) (holding the mere  delivery of\n\ngoods or services to a conspiracy does not constitute  membership\n\nin the conspiracy), to  this case.  Reisch's conduct  amounted to\n\nmore than a mere delivery of loans to a conspiracy.  The evidence\n\nindicated  that Reisch was involved  in the planning  of the down\n\npayment  scheme and that  he played a key  role in furthering the\n\nsuccess  of a conspiracy that was starved for new funds before he\n\nbegan supplying them.  In particular,  Reisch provided a specific\n\nloan  arrangement (involving  a  complex system  of wired  funds)\n\nespecially tailored  to falsifying  the down payments.   Reisch's\n\nactions  thus were not limited  to the mere  provision of lending\n\nservices but instead were strong evidence of an intent to further\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n                       4.  Ronald Hagopian \n\n          Hagopian was convicted of  conspiracy and six counts of\n\nbank fraud for his role as a broker for Dean Street who solicited\n\n                               -46-\n\nbuyers and  facilitated their purchases.26   The evidence against\n\nHagopian more  than adequately  establishes his knowledge  of Bay\n\nLoan's down payment requirement  and his knowing participation in\n\nvarious schemes to fraudulently  represent the existence of those\n\ndown payments.   To begin  with, Brandon testified  that he  told\n\nHagopian  about   \"his  relationship\"   with   Bay  Loan,   which\n\nestablishes Hagopian's knowledge that  Bay Loan was providing the\n\nfinancing.  Hagopian  knew a  down payment was  required for  the\n\nunits by virtue of the fact that he provided a down payment check\n\nfor his own purchase, and he discussed down payments with some of\n\nthe buyers he recruited.27\n\n          Hagopian also knew about and participated in the scheme\n\nto  falsify  the  existence  of  the  down  payments.    Hagopian\n\npurchased  several condominium  units and  wrote  a corresponding\n\ndown payment check that  Dean Street never negotiated.   Hagopian\n\ntold the buyers he recruited that  they needed to write checks to\n\nDean Street for the purchases of their units but  that the checks\n\nwould  either not  be used  or would  be  covered by  Dean Street\n\nitself.28   Hagopian also told  some buyers that  they would have\n\n                    \n\n26    The court  entered a  mid-trial  judgment of  acquittal for\nHagopian on one count of bank fraud.  Hagopian was also found not\nguilty by the jury on two counts of bank fraud.\n\n27   In  addition, Hagopian's  business partner,  John Ward,  who\nrounded up buyers with Hagopian, told one of these buyers to give\nWard a check \"for the down payment that was required.\"\n\n28   In addition,  Hagopian was  present during  several meetings\nwith  Brandon including one where Brandon told a buyer that there\nwere no down  payments.  Hagopian  also told this  to the  buyer.\nThe buyer eventually  did produce  a down payment  check for  his\npurchase and  the  check  was never  negotiated.    Hagopian  was\n\n                               -47-\n\nsecond  mortgages to cover part  of their down  payment but these\n\nmortgages would later be  discharged.  All of these  schemes were\n\nactually  executed with  many of  the buyers  Hagopian solicited.\n\nSometimes Hagopian returned voided or nonnegotiated  down payment\n\nchecks back to the buyers.   Hagopian also told buyers they would\n\nbe paid  for each unit  they bought and he  usually provided this\n\nrebate money to the buyers he had solicited after the closings. \n\n          Hagopian  adds a new twist to the familiar refrain that\n\nhe  thought he was participating in a perfectly legal real estate\n\nproject.  He  claims that the fact he openly solicited buyers for\n\na  \"no money down\" investment  opportunity proves that  he had no\n\nknowledge that Brandon's down  payment scheme defrauded the bank.\n\nHagopian placed public  advertisements for the  condominiums that\n\nexplicitly  promised \"no  money  down.\"   Hagopian contends  that\n\nbecause Dean Street took  care of all the financing,  his job was\n\nlimited to soliciting buyers for a type of real estate investment\n\nthat  was allegedly  common  at that  time  and  not in  any  way\n\nsuspicious.29\n\n                    \n\nsubsequently  asked about that check by the buyer who expected it\nto  be returned  to him and  was concerned  it might  actually be\ncashed.  Hagopian said he would look into it.\n\n29   Hagopian makes a related  argument that his conduct  did not\nfurther the conspiracy to a significant degree and that there was\nnot  sufficient interdependence  between  Hagopian and  the other\nconspirators  to  establish  that  he joined  the  conspiracy  as\nrequired.

The government has more than  met this\n    \nburden.\n\n                               -48-\n\n          The  evidence  clearly supports  the  jury's conclusion\n\nthat  Hagopian did  more than  innocently broker  deals for  Dean\n\nStreet.  Hagopian told  buyers of his \"no money  down\" investment\n\nopportunity  to provide  down payment  checks that  would  not be\n\ncashed  and  to sign  mortgages that  would  be discharged.   His\n\n\"openness\" in advertising no  money down investments simply shows\n\nhe was actively  soliciting buyers  to further the  scheme.   The\n\nscheme  relied  on  new  faces  to  serve  as  frontmen  for  the\n\nindividual  bank loans  and Hagopian's  actions were  an integral\n\npart of furthering the scheme's success.\n\n          Hagopian was  not open  about the  fact that  \"no money\n\ndown\"  meant providing  false paperwork  to the  bank so  that it\n\nwould  think down payments were  actually being made.  Regardless\n\nof whether 100% financing was customary at the  time and thus not\n\nsuspicious, the fake down payments and fake second mortgages were\n\ncertainly  not  customary (or  if customary  in the  1980s, still\n\nillegal),  and the jury was warranted in concluding that Hagopian\n\nknew this.   Finally, the  jury could reasonably  infer that  the\n\npublic advertising was just a necessary, and minor, risk taken by\n\nHagopian to  attract new  buyers and not  particularly convincing\n\nevidence of his innocence. \n\n                          5.  John Ward\n\n          Ward was convicted of conspiracy and six counts of bank\n\nfraud for purchasing a  unit and for soliciting and  facilitating\n\n                               -49-\n\nunit sales.30  The  evidence against Ward,  at least in terms  of\n\nknowledge and intent, is essentially the same as that against his\n\npartner,  Hagopian, and the two played  essentially the same role\n\nin the conspiracy.   Brandon  testified that he  told Ward  about\n\n\"his  relationship\"  with Bay  Loan.   Ward  also knew  that down\n\npayments were  required as he  was involved in  many of  the same\n\ndiscussions with potential buyers  that Hagopian was involved in.\n\nSpecifically, Ward  told one buyer to  give him a check  \"for the\n\ndown payment that was required.\"\n\n          Ward knew down payments were not actually being made as\n\nhis own down  payment was not negotiated  and he told one  buyer,\n\nwhose  down  payment funds  were to  be  wired into  that buyer's\n\naccount, that the down payment check would be cashed the same day\n\nso that the people wiring the funds \"got their money back.\"\n\n          We  reject Ward's  assertion that  he thought  Bay Loan\n\napproved  all of the various down payment shenanigans in which he\n\nwas  involved.  Ward  contends that the  down payment arrangement\n\nthat he was aware of was simply a paperwork requirement and not a\n\n\"real\" requirement; that  is, Ward  only knew that  some sort  of\n\npaper representing down payments had to exist but thought no real\n\nfunds  were actually required from the buyers.  We suppose Ward's\n\ncontention is within  the realm  of the possible.   However,  the\n\njury  looked at the  intricate down payment  arrangements and the\n\nway Ward explained them to the buyers and found, quite reasonably\n\n                    \n\n30   The district court entered a mid-trial judgment of acquittal\nin favor of Ward on one count of bank fraud.  The jury found Ward\nnot guilty on two additional counts of bank fraud.\n\n                               -50-\n\nwe  think,  that Ward  knew his  actions  were a  \"departure from\n\nfundamental  honesty.\"  Goldblatt, 813  F.2d at 624.   The common\n                                 \n\nsense understanding of a  down payment is the transfer  of actual\n\nfunds from  the buyer to the  seller or financier.   With this in\n\nmind, it  is more than reasonable for a  jury to find that once a\n\ndefendant  learned   of  the   structure  of  the   down  payment\n\narrangement  used  in  this  case,  with no  real  down  payments\n\nchanging hands, the  defendant would  be tipped off  to the  fact\n\nthat  a fraudulent  transaction  was contemplated.    Even if  we\n\nassume Brandon lied to Ward and  told him that Bay Loan  directed\n\nDean  Street to  arrange  for paper,  as  opposed to  real,  down\n\npayments,  the evidence was sufficient to  support a finding that\n\nWard knew he was engaging in a sham transaction.  \n\n          The evidence is also sufficient to prove Ward's willful\n\nparticipation in  the overall conspiracy and  Ward's execution of\n\nthe bank  fraud scheme  charged in  Counts 9,  15, 18,  and 19.31\n\nHowever,  the evidence is not  sufficient to show  that Ward took\n\nany actions  that would constitute  the engagement in  bank fraud\n\nset  forth  in Counts  24 and  25  of the  redacted indictment.32\n\nConsequently we uphold  the convictions on the  former counts and\n\nreverse the verdict against Ward on the latter two counts.\n\n                    \n\n31  Count 9 charges bank fraud in connection with Ward's purchase\nof a unit at the Bayside Motel.  Counts 15, 18 and 19 charge bank\nfraud  in relation to unit  purchases at the  Sandpiper Motel and\nthe Hillside Motel that were facilitated by John Ward and others.\n\n32  Counts 24 and 25 charged Ward and four  other defendants with\ndefrauding Bay Loan by obtaining an end loan for the purchases of\nunits  at the Sandcastle Motel by Bruce Schulbaum and John Mills,\nIII.\n\n                               -51-\n\n          As stated in Count 9, Ward bought a condominium unit at\n\nthe Bayside  Motel in October of 1987.  The down payment check he\n\nprovided  for the sale was never negotiated.  This is sufficient,\n\ngiven his  knowledge discussed  above, to support  the conclusion\n\nthat  Ward  never intended  to provide  real  funds for  the down\n\npayment  but   just  paperwork  to  deceive  the  bank.    Ward's\n\nconviction for bank fraud on Count 9 is thus upheld.  \n\n          The  evidence   is  also  sufficient  to   support  the\n\nconviction on  Counts 15, 18 and 19  which each charged Ward with\n\nbank fraud for  facilitating the sale  of a separate  condominium\n\nunit.   Ward  helped  to  solicit  the  buyers  involved  in  the\n\ntransactions for  these  counts  by  telling them  that  no  down\n\npayments  were  required.   He directed  one  of these  buyers to\n\nprovide down a payment check that would be funded by someone else\n\nand  then cashed  so  that the  funds  could be  returned.   Ward\n\nprovided the  buyers in Counts  15 and  18 with the  rebates they\n\nwere promised for purchasing units.  For the transaction in Count\n\n19, the evidence indicates that Ward was the intermediary for the\n\nfunds  wired  by  Brandon  to  cover  the  buyer's  down payment.\n\nBrandon's  wire transfer  was directed  to the  buyer's insurance\n\ncompany to the  attention of \"John Ward.\"  Thus, we uphold Ward's\n\nconvictions for conspiracy and on Counts 15, 18 and 19.\n\n          The evidence  is not sufficient, however,  to show that\n\nWard  engaged in bank fraud  with respect to  the transactions in\n\nCounts 24 and 25.  Although Ward was present at  the closings and\n\nseveral  of the  meetings  where down  payment arrangements  were\n\n                               -52-\n\ndiscussed for the sales in Counts 24 and 25, there is no evidence\n\nthat  Ward  said  anything  to these  particular  buyers  or  did\n\nanything  to otherwise  facilitate their  purchases.33   Ward did\n\nnot provide the  buyers in Counts  24 and 25  with rebates as  an\n\nincentive to buy nor did he  direct these buyers to falsify their\n\ndown  payments.34  As such,  Ward neither executed  nor aided the\n\nexecution  of  the  scheme to  defraud  in  these two  instances.\n\nBecause  we  see  no  evidence  in  the  record  to  support  any\n\nreasonable  finding  by  the jury  that  Ward  played  a role  in\n\nobtaining  the  loans  in  Counts  24  and  25,  we  reverse  his\n\nconvictions for these two counts.  \n\n                        6.  Owen Landman \n\n          Landman was  convicted of conspiracy and  six counts of\n\nbank  fraud in connection  with his facilitation  of down payment\n\narrangements  for  Dean  Street.35    Ample  evidence  exists  to\n\nsupport the finding that Landman knew  a down payment requirement\n\nexisted and  that he  knew about the  various fraudulent  methods\n\n                    \n\n33  Ward was involved in running the newspaper advertisement that\noriginally  attracted  the buyers  to  the  Dean Street  project.\nHowever,  that  act was  not  necessarily  directed toward  these\nspecific fraud counts and,  while contributing to the  fraud, was\nnot  alone  sufficient  to   constitute  an  affirmative  act  of\nfacilitation  of  the  fraudulent  loan  transactions charged  in\nCounts 24 and 25.\n\n34   We note that Hagopian,  who was also convicted  on these two\ncharges  and  whose conviction  we  are  upholding, did  actively\nsolicit the  buyers, discuss down payment  arrangements with them\n(such as dischargeable mortgages), and provide rebate money after\ntheir purchases.\n\n35   The  jury found  Landman not  guilty on  two counts  of bank\nfraud.\n\n                               -53-\n\nused to avoid that requirement.  As in Ward's case, however,  the\n\nevidence is  not sufficient to  show Landman participated  in the\n\nexecution of  a scheme to  defraud for four  out of the  six bank\n\nfraud counts.\n\n          Landman  acted as an escrow  agent for a  number of the\n\ncondominium  closings and  one of  his main  responsibilities was\n\nreceiving down payments from buyers and  transferring them to the\n\nseller,  Dean Street.  Marderosian testified that he told Landman\n\nthat  Gauvin and Granoff would  be funding down  payments for the\n\ninitial  purchasers and  Landman  should hold  that down  payment\n\nmoney.    Landman knew  that the  down  payment funds  were being\n\nreturned to  whoever provided  them as Landman  himself delivered\n\nthe money back to its source on several occasions.36   \n\n          Landman also knew about the fraudulent second mortgages\n\nthat were  supposed to cover part  of the down payment.   He knew\n\nthe buyers  were signing meaningless promissory  notes for second\n\nmortgages at the closings because Marderosian told him beforehand\n\nthat the mortgages would be discharged.  At the closings, several\n\nbuyers asked  Landman when  the  mortgages would  be released  as\n\npromised because the discharge  letter accomplishing this was not\n\npart of the closing  documents (presumably so Bay Loan  would not\n\n                    \n\n36   Marderosian explained to Landman that Reisch would be wiring\nmoney  directly into  buyers'  accounts  to  pay for  their  down\npayments and  that buyers  would then  write  checks to  Landman.\nLandman assured Reisch  that he would look after the  money.  The\nevidence  indicates that  with respect  to at  least some  of the\ntransactions, Landman returned the down payment funds that Reisch\nhad provided back to  Reisch, writing checks back to  Reisch from\nthe money Reisch had originally given to the buyers.\n\n                               -54-\n\nsee  the letter).    Landman made  gestures  to these  buyers  to\n\nindicate  that  they should  not talk  to  him about  it.37   All\n\nthese facts,  taken together, support the  jury's conclusion that\n\nLandman  knew that something illegal was being done to get around\n\nthe down payment requirement.\n\n          We reject Landman's argument that there is insufficient\n\nevidence  to prove he knew Bay Loan  was the target of the scheme\n\nto defraud.  To  begin with, Brandon was \"completely  open\" about\n\nBay  Loan's involvement and told  a number of  people involved in\n\nthe  scheme.  Several buyers  testified that they  knew about Bay\n\nLoan,  including  one  person  whose  only  involvement  was  his\n\npurchase  of a  single unit.   Landman  shared office  space with\n\nBrandon's  point   man  in  the  scheme,   Marderosian,  who  was\n\nintimately involved in all  the details of the scheme.   Finally,\n\nthe closing documents included  a letter indicating Bay Loan  was\n\nthe ultimate lender;38  Landman acted  as escrow  agent for  many\n\n                    \n\n37   At  one closing,  Kumalae \"asked  Owen if  he wanted  her to\naddress  [the  mortgage  discharge]  at the  time,\"  and  Landman\nresponded that  it \"had nothing  to do with  him . . .  he didn't\nwant to know  anything about it.\"  Another time  \"Mr. Landman did\nnot want to hear about it in front of us. I do recall him saying,\nhis  hands  saying not  in  front of  me.\"   Still  another buyer\ntestified  that  Landman  \"gestured\"  when  confronted  with  the\nmortgage discharge issue.  Landman argues that his  responses and\ngestures could  mean he just did  not know anything about  it and\ncould  not  answer  the  buyers'  inquiries.    We  find  that  a\nreasonable  jury  could  also  conclude  that  Landman's  actions\nindicated he already knew that something illegal was going on and\nwas trying to disassociate himself from it.\n\n38   As discussed in  footnote 24, Homeowners  furnished a letter\nstating that they transferred their rights in the mortgage to Bay\nLoan.   A  similar  document was  furnished for  the transactions\nbrokered by East  West.  Although the same  uncertainty regarding\nthe presence of the letter at the closings discussed in Granoff's\n\n                               -55-\n\nof the closings and also conducted a few of them himself.39\n\n          Sufficient  evidence  exists  to  support   the  jury's\n\nverdict on the conspiracy count and  on Counts 21 and 22.  Counts\n\n21  and 22 allege bank  fraud in connection  with the closings of\n\ntwo  units  at the  Hillside Motel.    The evidence  reveals that\n\nLandman  returned the  down payment  funds provided by  Reisch in\n\nconnection with these transactions back to Reisch in violation of\n\nthe down  payment requirement.40   In addition,  one Dean  Street\n\nemployee,  Marie Lynch,  testified  that, in  general, she  would\n\nbring  buyers' certified  down  payment checks  to Landman  after\n\nmoney was wired by  Reisch to the buyers' accounts  to accomplish\n\nthe certification.   Lynch testified  that she  once saw  Landman\n\nwrite a check to Reisch for the amount of the  down payment funds\n\nshe had  just  brought to  him.    Lynch did  not  specify  which\n\ntransactions she was referring to in her testimony but the record\n\ndoes  contain checks written by  Landman to Reisch  for the exact\n\namount of the down payment funds wired by Reisch for the Hillside\n\n                    \n\ncase above also  exists with  respect to Landman,  there is  more\nreason to  believe  Landman saw  and  read at  least one  of  the\nletters because Landman had greater exposure and familiarity with\nthe closing documents.\n\n39  Marderosian testified  that when he prepared Landman  for the\nclosings which  Landman conducted,  he \"explained  what documents\n[Marderosian]  would  be  preparing  and that  [Landman]  had  to\noversee their execution at the closing.\"\n\n40   That  evidence consists  of a  check written  by  Landman to\nReisch for the  exact amount of the funds which  Reisch had wired\ninto the buyers' accounts for the purchases in  Counts 21 and 22.\nAs discussed  above, at the time Landman  wrote the check, he had\nalready  been told what Reisch  was doing and  had agreed to look\nafter Reisch's money.\n\n                               -56-\n\npurchases referred to  in Counts 21 and 22.41   We therefore find\n\nthe evidence sufficient to support the convictions for bank fraud\n\ncharged in Counts 21 and 22.  This evidence is also sufficient to\n\nshow willful  participation in  the conspiracy and  thus supports\n\nLandman's conviction on Count 1.42\n\n          Landman argues  that his actions were just a normal and\n\nproper   function   of   his   job   as  escrow   agent.      His\n\nresponsibilities, he  claims, were strictly limited  to receiving\n\nand distributing  money at Dean  Street's direction.

This\n               \n\n\"just following orders\" defense  cannot stand in the face  of the\n\nevidence  showing  that Landman  knew  down  payments were  being\n\nfalsified,  that he  agreed  to safeguard  Reisch's down  payment\n\nfunds, and  that  he personally  falsified two  down payments  by\n\nreturning  the funds to Reisch.   The evidence  was sufficient to\n\nindicate that Landman's intent was to participate in transactions\n\n                    \n\n41  Although the testimony that Landman \"[c]ut a check to Norman\"\nReisch  referred to a transaction  sometime in the  fall of 1988,\nroughly a month after the Hillside  closings in Counts 21 and 22,\nit  does  add  some  credence  to  the  government's  account  of\nLandman's involvement in the scheme to defraud.\n\n42   Landman  is wrong  in claiming  that the  jury impermissibly\nascribed  the illegal  actions of  Marderosian  to Landman.

Returning  down payment  funds that  are\nrequired by the bank is not only within  the foreseeable scope of\nthe conspiracy but directly in furtherance of it.  The government\nthus  established Landman's  criminal conduct  independently from\nthat of Marderosian.\n\n                               -57-\n\ndesigned to deceive Bay Loan. \n\n          With  respect  to Counts  23  through  26, relating  to\n\nclosings  at the Sandcastle Motel,  no checks written  by, or to,\n\nLandman that involved down  payment funds were in evidence.   The\n\ngovernment  stipulated   that  the  relevant   checks  for  these\n\ntransactions  were forgeries.  In particular, Landman's signature\n\non  the  checks for  the Sandcastle  transactions were  forged by\n\nMarderosian.43   It is  true that Landman  conducted the closings\n\nfor the Sandcastle units  and thus in some sense  facilitated the\n\nscheme to defraud,44  but that  alone is not  sufficient to  show\n\nthat  Landman participated  in the  relevant act  of fraudulently\n\nviolating  the  down  payment  requirement  for  those individual\n\ntransactions.  On the  contrary, it seems that Landman  never saw\n\nthe down  payment  checks as  the money  did not  go through  his\n\nescrow account.  Instead, the checks were transferred directly to\n\nReisch.\n\n                    \n\n43    The existence  of forgeries  does  not, as  Landman claims,\nprovide conclusive  proof  of his  innocence on  all the  counts.\nJust  because his name was forged on  some of the checks does not\nnecessarily  imply that Landman  did not know of,  or agree to go\nalong with,  the conspiracy.  In other words, it is not true that\nthe forgeries could only indicate that  Marderosian was forced to\ngo behind  Landman's back to  accomplish the  scheme to  defraud.\nFor one,  Marderosian testified  that Landman authorized  some of\nthe forgeries  and indicated  that forging  Landman's name was  a\nmethod  of convenience rather than a way to hide illicit activity\nfrom  Landman.  More  importantly, Landman  did write  checks for\nillegal transactions  in Counts 21 and 22,  which, in conjunction\nwith  the  other  proof of  Landman's  knowledge  and  intent, is\nsufficient to uphold the conspiracy charge.\n\n44  Lynch's  testimony that Landman  wrote a check to  Reisch for\nthe   Sandcastle  units   is   decisively  contradicted   by  the\ngovernment's stipulation that the checks were forgeries.\n\n                               -58-\n\n          We note that Landman  also conducted closings for units\n\nat the Atlantic Inn-Narragansett,  but the jury acquitted Landman\n\non the charges connected to those transactions (Counts 16 and 17)\n\napparently because it  found the act  of conducting the  closings\n\nwas, by  itself,  insufficient to  establish the  execution of  a\n\nscheme to defraud.  For Counts 23 through 26, once the stipulated\n\nforgeries  are  removed  from consideration,  there  is similarly\n\nlittle  evidence to  support a  conviction  beyond the  fact that\n\nLandman conducted the  closings.  While  the jury is not  held to\n\nconsistent  results, we think that the acquittal on Counts 16 and\n\n17 reinforces our judgment that  (absent some confusion about the\n\nforged checks),45  there was insufficient evidence  to convict on\n\nCounts  23 through 26.   Because the evidence  is insufficient to\n\nprove  that Landman  executed or  aided in  the execution  of the\n\nschemes to defraud Bay  Loan charged in Counts 23  through 26, we\n\nreverse his conviction on those counts.\n\n                         7.  Momi Kumalae\n\n          Kumalae was convicted of conspiracy and three counts of\n\nbank fraud  in connection  with  various actions  she took  while\n\n                    \n\n45  There  was apparently some confusion surrounding the exhibits\ncontaining the forged checks.   The government agreed to  use the\nchecks  only against  the  other defendants,  namely Reisch,  but\nargued during  closing argument that Landman  was responsible for\nthe  checks written  to  Reisch on  the  Sandcastle units.    The\ngovernment  did  not explicitly  state  that  Landman signed  the\nforged checks; however, it  failed to acknowledge the stipulation\nof forgeries and  seemed to imply  no forgeries existed.   In any\nevent, we are  convinced that the jury improperly  considered the\nforged checks in their guilty finding on Counts 23 through 26.\n\n                               -59-\n\nworking  as  an  assistant to  Brandon  at  Dean  Street.46   The\n\nevidence  establishing Kumalae's  knowledge  of  Bay Loan's  down\n\npayment requirement and the scheme to fraudulently violate  it is\n\nthe  following:  (1) Brandon testified that he told Kumalae about\n\nhis  relationship  with  Bay  Loan,  (2)  an East  West  employee\n\ntestified that she asked Kumalae to forward information about the\n\nunit buyers so that she could  satisfy the guidelines established\n\nby  Bay  Loan;  (3)  Kumalae  was  present  during  some  of  the\n\nconversations  between Brandon,  Ward,  Hagopian and  a buyer  in\n\nwhich down payments were discussed; (4) Kumalae was also  present\n\nat a meeting  at which  Brandon said  \"they needed  to show  down\n\npayments or something  so they were going to  wire money into the\n\naccounts or deposit it and they needed one of our checks to prove\n\nthat it came out of our account\"; (5) Kumalae told one buyer that\n\nshe needed  a check  from him  and that she  would be  \"doing the\n\ntransactions at the banks\";  (6) Kumalae assured one  buyer whose\n\ndown payment check had not been negotiated that his check had not\n\nbeen  used;  and,  (7)  Kumalae instructed  another  Dean  Street\n\nemployee,  Marie Lynch, who had asked about the discharges of the\n\nsecond mortgages  that \"there weren't  supposed to be  any second\n\nmortgages  and to  just don't  worry about  it.  They  were being\n\ntaken care of.\"\n\n          The evidence  that she  willfully participated  in this\n\nscheme is as  follows: (1)  Kumalae advised buyers  of how  their\n\n                    \n\n46  The jury found Kumalae not guilty on one count of bank fraud.\n\n                               -60-\n\ndown  payment  requirement would  be  satisfied;47  (2) she  once\n\nwired  money from her own account to a buyer in order to fund his\n\ndown  payment;48   (3)  she   signed  several  of   the  mortgage\n\ndischarge  letters  provided  to   the  buyers;49  and,  (4)  she\n\nreceived  some of the down payment checks, and because several of\n\nthese checks  were  deposited  directly  into  Reisch's  account,\n\npresumably by Kumalae,  she effected the  return of down  payment\n\nfunds  to  their   source  in  violation  of  the   down  payment\n\nrequirement.   All  of  this evidence  is  sufficient to  support\n\nKumalae's bank fraud and conspiracy convictions.\n\n          Kumalae  attempts  to  rely  on cases  holding  that  a\n\ndefendant's  mere  presence at  the scene  of  the crime  or mere\n\nassociation  with criminals  to whom  all the  evidence  at trial\n\npertains is insufficient to  support a conviction for conspiracy.\n\nUnited  States v.

Kumalae's reliance\n         \n\non these cases is misplaced  because the government's case rested\n\n                    \n\n47   Kumalae told one buyer \"no  down payments\" were required and\nthat  Brandon was a \"stand-up guy\" who would \"take care of things\nand not to worry.\"  On another occasion she told a buyer that his\nmortgage discharge \"would be taken care of after the closing.\"\n\n48   This was the basis for  the transaction for Count  15 and is\nsufficient to support her conviction on that count.\n\n49  One buyer  testifies that he picked  up his discharge  letter\nand the letter  of another  buyer directly from  Kumalae.   These\ndischarges  were made for the  transactions in Counts  24 and 25.\nWe  note that the jury  acquitted Kumalae on  Count 23 presumably\nbecause  there  was  no   such  testimony  to  support  Kumalae's\ninvolvement with the discharge.\n\n                               -61-\n\non Kumalae's own knowledge of the scheme to defraud based on  her\n\nown statements  to others  and on  a series  of actions taken  by\n\nKumalae  herself that  directly  defrauded Bay  Loan.   Kumalae's\n\nargument that she  was just  acting in good  faith by  performing\n\nministerial duties for Dean Street  and nothing more also  fails.\n\nThe  record is  clear that  Kumalae wired  down payment  funds to\n\nbuyers  from  her  own  account  and  signed  mortgage  discharge\n\nletters.  These actions were not merely \"ministerial duties.\"\n\n                          V.  SEVERANCE\n\n          The district court  denied the motions for  severance50\n\nmade by several  of the  defendants51 who argued  that they  were\n\nunfairly prejudiced  by the  evidentiary spillover from  the case\n\npresented   against  their  more  culpable  co-defendants.    The\n\ndefendants' claim is that the  joint trial seriously limited  the\n\njury's ability  to sift  through all  the  evidence against  each\n\nindividual defendant and increased  the risk that the  jury would\n\nbase  its verdicts on evidence which  has no bearing on the guilt\n\nor innocence of defendants with a more limited involvement in the\n\n                    \n\n50    The  rule  authorizing  motions  for  severance  states  in\npertinent part:\n\n            If  it appears that a defendant  . . . is\n            prejudiced   by  a  joinder   .  .  .  of\n            defendants . . .  for trial together, the\n            court  may .  .  . grant  a severance  of\n            defendants  or   provide  whatever  other\n            relief justice requires.\n\nFed.

Whatever the advisability, in general,  of holding mass\n\ntrials  in  complicated cases  with  many  defendants of  varying\n\nculpabilities,  we   do  not  find  any   significant  degree  of\n\nunfairness  or  prejudice in  this  case  that  would  warrant  a\n\nreversal of the district court's refusal to sever the trial. \n\n          The decision to grant or deny a motion for severance is\n\ncommitted to  the sound discretion of the trial court and we will\n\nreverse  its refusal  to sever  only upon  a finding  of manifest\n\nabuse of  discretion.

PRETRIAL PUBLICITY\n\n          On  January  1,  1990,  the Governor  of  Rhode  Island\n\nordered  the closure of credit unions  in that state insured by a\n\nprivate  entity  known  as   the  Rhode  Island  Savings  Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (RISDIC).  After years of risky real estate\n\ninvestments, many credit  unions were unable to  weather the late\n\n1980s crash in  the real estate market and RISDIC could not cover\n\ntheir anticipated losses.   In the process of closing  the credit\n\nunions, the governor froze the assets of hundreds of thousands of\n\nangry  depositors.  The ensuing panic among depositors as well as\n\nthe public  hearings, criminal investigations, and civil lawsuits\n\nreceived extensive media coverage.  The Rhode Island credit union\n\ncrisis, although  coexistent with Dean Street's  downfall, is not\n\nrelated to the present case.\n\n          Defendants  raised a  series of  claims related  to the\n\ndistrict  court's  alleged  failure   to  shield  them  from  the\n\nprejudicial effects  of publicity  surrounding  the Rhode  Island\n\ncredit union crisis.  They argue that their right to an impartial\n\njury  was jeopardized by the trial court's denial of their change\n\nof  venue motion, their  request for individual  voir dire, their\n\nrequest to question the  jurors about losing money in  the credit\n\nunion  crisis,  and  their request  for  a  mistrial or  curative\n\ninstructions after the admission  of certain evidence relating to\n\n                               -65-\n\nthe failed credit unions.   As we  find no significant threat  to\n\nthe trial's  fairness from the effects  of unfavorable publicity,\n\nwe uphold the district  court's denial of the motions  related to\n\nprejudicial publicity.\n\n                       A.

Prejudicial Evidence\n\n          During the trial, the  judge admitted evidence relating\n\nto some of the  failed credit unions and individuals  involved in\n\nthe credit  union crisis.  Specifically,  during the government's\n\ndirect  examination of  Marderosian  in which  he was  questioned\n\nabout  the use  of Bay  Loan funds  obtained from  the Sandcastle\n\nclosings,   Marderosian  explained   that,  in   accordance  with\n\nBrandon's  instructions,  he had  deliberately  failed  to pay  a\n\npreexisting  $1.5  million  mortgage  held by  the  Rhode  Island\n\n                    \n\n            and  I want  to  be  sure  that  everyone\n            understands that this case is not  in any\n            way related  to those  events.   Is there\n            anybody  who  thinks   they  would   have\n            difficulty in separating  this case  from\n            anything  you might have  heard about the\n            problems  credit  unions in  Rhode Island\n            have experienced?\n\n55  Defendants  make an additional  argument that because  jurors\nwere told  that the credit  crisis had no relation  to this case,\nthey  did not think losing  money in credit  unions was important\nbefore the trial started and thus would not have responded to the\njudge's comments  during voir dire.   Yet, once  evidence linking\ndefendants  to the  credit  crisis was  presented  at trial,  see\n                                                                 \nsubsection C, the issue  of losing money became critical  and the\nrisk of bias was no longer adequately addressed by the voir dire.\nThe  creativity  of   this  argument  is  matched  only   by  its\nimprobability and speculative nature.

Marderosian,  the\n\ngovernment's key witness,  was attacked  by the  defense and  the\n\nmedia as the main culprit in the scheme and the government sought\n\nto  bolster the  credibility  of his  testimony  by showing  that\n\nMarderosian  did not improperly divert  any of the  large sums of\n\nmoney that he  handled into his  own pocket.   The evidence  also\n\nhelped provide a foundation  for later expert testimony regarding\n\nwhat  happened to the funds obtained from  Bay Loan in the course\n\nof the scheme to defraud. \n\n          The relevancy  of the evidence  sufficiently outweighed\n\nthe  minimal  prejudicial effect  that was  created by  the brief\n\nmention  of individuals and  entities that were  connected to the\n\ncredit union crisis.  First  of all, nothing at trial  linked the\n\nnamed individuals  and entities  to  RISDIC or  the credit  union\n\ncrisis.   In order to find prejudice, the court would have had to\n\ninfer that the  jury had  heard of the  individuals and  entities\n\nfrom an external source and also knew of their involvement in the\n\ncredit  union scandal.58   Even  if  the jurors  did know  of the\n\ninvolvement  of  the  named   individuals  and  entities,  it  is\n\n                    \n\n58  The judge offered to question the jurors about their possible\nknowledge  of the  persons named  in  the disputed  testimony but\ndefense counsel refused.\n\n                               -71-\n\ndoubtful, given  the court's various cautioning  instructions and\n\nthe voir dire process, that jurors would likely be biased against\n\ndefendants just  because certain  names were mentioned  at trial.\n\nAt most, the jurors might conclude that defendants contributed to\n\nthe failure of at least one  credit union by not repaying certain\n\nloans.   The trial judge  asked the jurors, however,  if they had\n\nlost any money  from bank  fraud related schemes  and no  sitting\n\njurors said they had.  Thus we have no reason to believe that any\n\njuror who  may have inferred  that defendants contributed  to the\n\ncredit  union  crisis  would   be  particularly  likely  to  find\n\ndefendants  guilty  without  fairly  considering   the  evidence.\n\nFinally, to  the  extent  that  the balancing  of  relevance  and\n\nprejudice was a close  call, we find no  abuse of discretion  and\n\nuphold the trial court's admission of the disputed evidence.\n\n                   VII.  EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n          During  the  trial,  defendants  attempted  to  proffer\n\nevidence  regarding  the allegedly  common practice  by financial\n\ninstitutions  of  requiring  no  down  payment  on  the  sale  of\n\ncommercial  real   estate.    On   cross-examination  of  several\n\ngovernment  witnesses, Hagopian's  attorney asked whether  it was\n\ncustomary  during  the  relevant  time  period  to  buy and  sell\n\ncommercial  properties  with no  money  down and  to  obtain 100%\n\nfinancing.  The government objected on relevancy  grounds and the\n\ndistrict court  sustained the  objections.  On  another occasion,\n\nBrandon presented an expert witness, James  White, to bolster the\n\ncredibility of certain testimony.  Brandon had testified that Bay\n\n                               -72-\n\nLoan Vice  President Gormley  acknowledged that the  proposed end\n\nloans to  unit buyers actually constituted  one single commercial\n\nloan  to Dean  Street,  even though  they  were to  be  submitted\n\nindividually as  consumer residential  loans.  Brandon  sought to\n\npresent Mr. White's  opinion that  the loans at  issue were  more\n\nconsistent  with  commercial rather  than  consumer  loans.   The\n\ndistrict court again excluded the testimony on relevancy grounds.\n\nWe affirm the trial court's rulings.59\n\n          In general, \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible\" and\n\n\"[e]vidence  which is not relevant  is not admissible.\"   Fed.

The  proffered  evidence,\n\n                    \n\n59  Because  we find the  disputed evidence was  not relevant  to\ndefendant's  case, we  also  reject Brandon's  argument that  the\ntrial court impaired his right to present his theory of defense.\n\n                               -73-\n\nhowever, does not make  either of these theories any  more likely\n\nto be true and thus the evidence is irrelevant.\n\n          As for the first theory, Brandon tried to show at trial\n\nthat  Bay Loan aggressively  purchased non-conforming loans, that\n\nhe openly sought 100% financing from  the bank, and that Bay Loan\n\nagreed  to  provide  the   financing  without  down  payments  by\n\ndirecting  Dean  Street  to falsify  the  paperwork  to show  the\n\nexistence of  down  payments.    The  expert  testimony  and  the\n\ngovernment witness's  testimony about  the common practice  of no\n\ndown  payment  financing  may  add  support  to  the  first   two\n\nassertions,  but those assertions are simply not at issue in this\n\ncase.  Rather, Bay Loan's alleged approval of false down payments\n\nis  at issue.  The defendants, however, have not demonstrated any\n\nrelationship between the proffered  evidence that no down payment\n\nfinancing  was a common practice and the likelihood that Bay Loan\n\ndirected  Dean Street  to falsify  paperwork to  misrepresent the\n\nexistence of down payments that were never made.\n\n          The  problem  with  defendants'  argument  is  that  no\n\nconnection between the common  use of 100% financing and  the use\n\nof  false down  payments was  ever established.60   That  is, for\n\n                    \n\n60   The same problem exists regarding the connection between the\nfake  down   payments  and   the  expert's   distinction  between\nresidential and commercial loans.  Brandon sought to characterize\nthe mortgages from Bay Loan as more like commercial than consumer\nloans  and  thus subject  to  different  standards and  policies.\nSpecifically, he  sought to show  that 100% financing  was normal\nfor  commercial  loans  and  to counter  the  allegedly  critical\ncontention   that  residential   loans  typically   require  down\npayments.  This  is basically the  same type of  evidence as  the\ntestimony  that 100%  financing  was customary  in the  industry.\nThat  is, a  showing that  Bay Loan's  mortgages  were commercial\n\n                               -74-\n\nthe evidence to be relevant, there must be some reason to believe\n\nthat 100% financing, or no down payment financing, is customarily\n\nprovided  in  conjunction   with  paperwork  showing  fake   down\n\npayments.   A no down  payment custom does  not establish a  fake\n\ndown  payment  custom.    The  defendants  lack,  therefore,  any\n\nfoundation that would make the proffered evidence relevant.\n\n          \"'Trial judges have wide discretion in deciding whether\n\nan adequate  foundation  has  been  laid  for  the  admission  of\n\nevidence.'\"    Veranda Beach  Club  Ltd.

No foundation was laid in this  case.  Even if\n\nwe  accept 100%  financing was  in fact  generally common  in the\n\nindustry and  for Bay Loan,  it does not  follow that Bay  Loan's\n\napproval of false down  payment transactions is any  more likely.\n\nDefendants  must provide,  for  example, some  evidence that  the\n\nrecording  of down payments in no down payment transactions was a\n\ncommon  formality, perhaps  for  accounting, tax  or  bookkeeping\n\n                    \n\nhelps  to establish the  likelihood that the  loans were actually\n\"no  down payment  loans.\"   This  still  leaves us  without  the\nmissing foundational  link -- that  no down payment  financing is\nsomehow associated with falsified down payments.\n\n   In response  to Brandon's claim that the government proved its\ncase  by showing the transactions deviated from the norm, we note\nthat the relevant norm is  not 100% versus 80% financing but  the\nstandard method  of representing down payments,  or lack thereof,\nin loan transactions.  Proof  of a no down payment norm  does not\nestablish a fake down payment norm.\n\n                               -75-\n\npurposes,61  or for  the  convenience of  some interested  party.\n\nIf  such evidence  existed,  then maybe  a sufficient  foundation\n\nwould exist for  the relevance  of 100% financing.   However,  no\n\nsuch foundation is evident in the record.\n\n          What defendants were really trying to show  is that the\n\nbank or its officials  were themselves perpetrating some sort  of\n\nfraud and  the defendants were unwittingly caught up in it.  This\n\nassertion,  however,  also  lacks   foundational  support.    The\n\ndefendants want the proffered evidence to establish that Bay Loan\n\nwas in the practice  of providing 100% financing and  thus likely\n\nto be providing 100%  financing in this case as  well, regardless\n\nof whether such financing  involved fake down payments, kickbacks\n\nor fraudulent paperwork.  This formulation, however, obscures the\n\nreal issue: if Bay Loan intended to provide 100% financing, or if\n\ndefendants thought down payments  were waived, why did they  have\n\nto  take actions  to  falsify down  payments?   To  satisfy  this\n\nrequisite  foundational  question,  the  defendants had  to  show\n\neither  that,  (1)  officials at  Bay  Loan  stood  to reap  some\n\npersonal  gain  by  offering  loans  with  no  down  payments  in\n\nviolation of the  bank's requirements and thus  needed to falsify\n\n                    \n\n61   Brandon claims that  Bay Loan  directed him to  falsify down\npayments so that the  bank could package the commercial  loans as\nresidential  loans.  Were his  claim true, however,  it would not\nmake the common practice of  providing commercial loans, and  the\n100% financing such loans allegedly involve, any more relevant to\nthe  issue  of  why   the  falsification  of  down  payments   is\njustifiable.   Still lacking is  some indication that  the common\npractice of lending  money without  down payments  makes it  more\nlikely  that the bank would find  it necessary to mischaracterize\nloans and consequently  direct Dean Street to produce  false down\npayment paperwork.\n\n                               -76-\n\ndown payments to hide  the violation from bank superiors;  or (2)\n\nthe bank  as a whole  stood to  reap some gain  by lending  money\n\nunder  false  pretenses,  perhaps  to  deceive  their  creditors,\n\nshareholders,  or regulators.62  In  the absence of some evidence\n\nsupporting these  two propositions, the custom  of 100% financing\n\nor  the characterization of the loans as commercial as opposed to\n\nresidential does not make Bay Loan's  approval of fraudulent down\n\npayments any more  likely to  be true.   Again, the  foundational\n\nlink is simply missing.\n\n          The   excluded  evidence  is  similarly  irrelevant  to\n\ndefendants'  lack of  knowledge or  intent to  defraud Bay  Loan.\n\nDefendants claim that evidence that 100% financing was a standard\n\npractice supports their claim  that they did not know  or suspect\n\nanything was unusual or illegal about the  loan transactions they\n\nparticipated in.   Again, what  is at issue  is the existence  of\n\nfalsified  down payments.   There  is no  basis for  finding that\n\ndefendants  were  more likely  to  think  that  their actions  to\n\nfacilitate  the documentation of  nonexistent down  payments were\n\nsomehow legitimate just because 100% financing was customary.  To\n\nput  it another  way, the  proffered evidence  does not  make the\n\nfalse  down  payment  maneuvers  less  likely  to  tip   off  the\n\ndefendants to the  illegal nature of the transaction without some\n\nfoundation  connecting 100%  financing to  creative down  payment\n\n                    \n\n62   Defendants presented  evidence that  Bay Loan  was knowingly\nlending in violation  of other requirements  it imposed, not  the\nleast  of which  was  the requirement  that  buyers live  in  the\ncondominiums they purchased which  was impossible given the units\nwere to be operated as motels.\n\n                               -77-\n\npaperwork  of some  kind.   Defendants were  not engaged  in what\n\nappeared to them to be a \"no down payment transaction\"; they were\n\ndoing  what appeared to  them to be  a transaction  where a paper\n\ndown  payment was documented and  recorded but not actually paid.\n\nThe no  down payment custom would  only be relevant to  intent if\n\nthat custom  involved something even vaguely similar to this sort\n\nof paper  down payment.  Because no such foundation exists on the\n\nrecord, and because we find no abuse of discretion on the part of\n\nthe trial court in refusing to  allow the jury to assume or infer\n\nthat  foundation,  we  uphold  the  exclusion  of  the  proffered\n\nevidence.63\n\n  VIII.  PREJUDICE FROM COMMENTS REGARDING DEFENDANTS' ETHNICITY\n\n          During the  fifth day  of trial, the  government's main\n\nwitness, Marderosian, testified about a comment made by defendant\n\nLandman concerning the religious affinity between Landman and co-\n\ndefendant  Reisch.     Marderosian   was  describing   on  direct\n\nexamination the arrangement for Reisch to wire down payment money\n\ninto buyers' accounts.  The arrangement was designed, in part, to\n\nallay Reisch's  concern that too much money  would be outstanding\n\nbetween the time he provided funds to the buyers and the time the\n\nfunds were  returned to him  by Dean Street.   In reference  to a\n\n                    \n\n63  Unlike  the cases cited  by defendant that  have held that  a\ncertain custom or practice  in an industry may be relevant to the\ndefendant's case, United States v.

The reference to defendants' Judaism  was\n\nthe only such mention of  religion at trial.  It amounted  to one\n\nbrief sentence in nineteen days of testimony and argument.  There\n\nwas  no subsequent reference to  the challenged testimony nor did\n\nthe government use the issue of religious affinity in its closing\n\nargument.  The inference of Jewish affinity was not, as defendant\n\nLandman claims, central to  the government's case.  The  basis of\n\nLandman's  agreement to participate in the conspiracy was not his\n\n                               -80-\n\npromise to protect the interests of Reisch but his agreement with\n\nMarderosian and Brandon to facilitate the unit sales without down\n\npayments.

None  of  these  facts have\n\nanything to  do with  Landman's supposed religious  affinity with\n\nReisch.65 Likewise,  the evidence  against Reisch  centers around\n\nhis agreement with Brandon to provide money to the scheme and not\n\naround  his  relationship with  Landman.   In  fact,  Landman was\n\nacquitted by the jury on two bank  fraud counts that involved the\n\nfunding of down payments by Reisch in which Landman conducted the\n\nclosings. This indicates that the jury was not prejudiced and did\n\nnot rely on the disputed testimony in its verdict.  \n\n          Nothing  like  the  serious  prejudicial  circumstances\n\nfound in United  States v.

Marderosian testified that Reisch  told Landman that\n\"he  wanted Mr. Landman  to look out for  his interest to protect\nhis   money  to  the  extent  possible.\"     Landman  later  told\nMarderosian \"he would  try to  protect Mr. Reisch  to the  extent\npossible.\"\n\n                               -81-\n\nwith his Colombian co-defendants.

Marderosian  had  made a  similar statement  about\n\ndefendants' Judaism when  he testified before the  grand jury and\n\nthe pattern  of questioning  prior to Marderosian's  statement at\n\ntrial  could  be  construed as  an  attempt  to  elicit the  same\n\ntestimony from him a second time.   At the bench conference  with\n\nthe  judge,   the  prosecutor  denied  knowing   beforehand  that\n\nMarderosian would make the comment about defendants' religion and\n\nclaimed to  have instructed Marderosian to limit his testimony to\n\nthe  fact  that Landman  said  Reisch felt  comfortable  with the\n\narrangement.

They also argue that it was error for the judge to\n\ngive an instruction concerning willful blindness.\n\n                    \n\n66  Defendant Granoff makes an additional argument that the trial\njudge erroneously failed to instruct the jury that they must find\nthat defendants knew  of Bay Loan's federally  insured status and\nthat defendants knew  Bay Loan  was the target  of the scheme  to\ndefraud.   Because we found  that neither of  these elements were\nrequired for a conviction under the bank fraud statute, see supra\n                                                                 \nSection IV, the trial court  did not err in refusing to  give the\nproffered instructions.\n\n   The trial judge was thus correct in instructing the jury that:\n\n            it is not necessary for the Government to\n            prove   that   the  Defendant   knew  the\n            identity  of   the  particular  financial\n            institution  or  that the  Defendant knew\n            that   that  institution   was  Federally\n            chartered  or insured.  . .  .

This instruction, defendants allege, is necessary to\n\nproperly define  \"intent to  participate\" or  \"intent to  join\" a\n\nconspiracy.   Without an expression  of the  innocent case,  they\n\nadd,  the instructions leave open  the door for the impermissible\n\ninference that a defendant can be guilty of conspiring to defraud\n\nBay  Loan simply  by providing  money to  Dean Street  knowing it\n\nwould be used illegally.  Defendants claim that because the murky\n\ndistinction between lawful cooperation and  illegal participation\n\nis  especially close  in  this case,  the  district court  had  a\n\nspecial obligation to be clear.\n\n          In  some  situations, this  type  of \"negative\"  Direct\n                                                                 \n\nSales  instruction might be required,  but we see  nothing in the\n     \n\nfacts  of this  case that  makes the  distinction  between simply\n\nknowing  of  the illegal  nature of  the  scheme and  agreeing to\n\nfurther the  scheme particularly  crucial to  the  defense.   The\n\ncentral defense of  most defendants  was that they  did not  know\n\nthat  Dean Street  was doing  anything  illegal in  obtaining the\n\n                               -86-\n\nloans.  Once knowledge of illegality is established, the evidence\n\nof  defendants' participation,  as  opposed  to merely  providing\n\ngoods and services to the conspiracy, is overwhelming and not, as\n\ndefendants assert, a close call.  See supra Section IV.\n                                           \n\n          In any  event, we think the  trial court's instructions\n\nwere  quite clear  that  (1) \"[i]n  order  to be  a  member of  a\n\nconspiracy,  a  Defendant  must   have  willfully  joined  it  or\n\nparticipated in it for the purpose of advancing or furthering its\n\nunlawful  purpose\"; and  (2)  that defendant  must  have both  an\n\nintent to agree to join the conspiracy and the specific intent to\n\ncommit  bank fraud.   These  instructions adequately  defined the\n\nrequisite \"intent  to participate\" and  foreclosed any  inference\n\nthat knowingly providing goods to a criminal enterprise is itself\n\nsufficient to support a finding of intent to join the conspiracy.\n\nThe  trial  court need  not employ  the  most elegant  or concise\n\nphraseology  nor  must it  incorporate  the  precise language  of\n\ndefendants'  request as long as the instructions taken as a whole\n\n\"accurately  communicated  the  meat  of  the defense's  theory.\"\n\nMcGill,  953 F.2d at 12.  In this case,  the court's instructions\n      \n\nadequately   communicated  the   defendants'  theory   that  mere\n\nknowledge  and  assistance,  without  an intent  to  further  the\n\nenterprise, is not enough. \n\n             B.  Instruction On Multiple Conspiracies\n\n          The defendants also challenge the trial court's refusal\n\nto  instruct  the  jury   as  to  the  possibility   of  multiple\n\n                               -87-\n\nconspiracies.68   Such an instruction was  warranted, they claim,\n\nbecause  the evidence  indicated  that  different defendants  had\n\ndifferent  relationships with  Dean Street  and were  involved in\n\nseparate  schemes.  Although the judge may have erred in refusing\n\nto charge  multiple conspiracies, we  find insufficient prejudice\n\nto warrant a reversal of the convictions.\n\n          A trial court should grant a  defendant's request for a\n\nmultiple conspiracy  instruction if, \"on the  evidence adduced at\n\ntrial,  a reasonable jury could  find more than  one such illicit\n\nagreement, or  could find  an  agreement different  from the  one\n\ncharged.\"  United States  v.

Our task,  then, is to determine if  the degree of\n\nprejudice  from the possible  error necessitates a  reversal.  We\n\nfind that it does not.\n\n          We will reverse a  court's erroneous refusal to  give a\n\nsubstantively  correct  instruction  only  when  that instruction\n\nconcerned an important  point such  that the failure  to give  it\n\nseriously  undermined  the  defendant's  ability  to  effectively\n\npresent a given defense.

Thus, we see no risk that the\n\njury  based a defendant's  conviction on evidence  relating to an\n\nunrelated offense.

Defendants\n\nclaim the  instruction was  reversible error  because it  was not\n\napplicable to this case and because it caused the jury to convict\n\ndefendants  without  finding  sufficient  evidence  of  knowledge\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          We  find,  first  of  all,  that  the  instruction  was\n\n                    \n\n72  The rest of the court's willful blindness instruction stated:\n\n            In  order  to infer  knowledge,  you must\n            find   that   two   things    have   been\n            established.\n\n            First, that the Defendant was aware  of a\n            high probability of the fact in question.\n\n            And    second,    that   the    Defendant\n            consciously   and  deliberately   avoided\n            learning of those facts.  That is to say,\n            that the Defendant willfully made himself\n            blind to those facts.   It is entirely up\n            to you to  determine whether a  Defendant\n            deliberately  closed his  or her  eyes to\n            the facts and, if  so, what inference, if\n            any, should be drawn.\n\n            However, it  is important to bear in mind\n            that  mere  negligence   or  mistake   in\n            failing  to   learn  the  facts   is  not\n            sufficient.   There must  be a deliberate\n            effort to remain ignorant of the facts.\n\n                               -94-\n\nappropriate and accurate as to defendant Landman; hence, no error\n\nwas made  in his case.   The  trial court may  instruct the  jury\n\nconcerning willful  blindness when a  defendant claims a  lack of\n\nknowledge,   the  facts  support   an  inference  of  defendant's\n\nconscious course  of deliberate ignorance,  and the  instruction,\n\ntaken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood by a juror as mandating\n\nthe  inference  of knowledge.

The evidence also supports the conclusion that Landman\n\nknew about the scheme to fraudulently represent the  existence of\n\ndown payments.74    However, on  cross-examination,  the  defense\n\nattempted to impeach Marderosian's testimony that he told Landman\n\nabout  the dischargeable  second  mortgages to  be  given to  the\n\nbuyers  which  called  into  question  a key  piece  of  evidence\n\nregarding Landman's knowledge.  There was, nevertheless, evidence\n\nthat Landman tried to avoid learning of particular buyers' use of\n\ndischargeable mortgages for their  down payments.  During several\n\nclosings Landman was asked by  buyers about the second mortgages.\n\nOn one occasion,  he told the buyer that he  \"didn't want to know\n\nanything about it.\"   At other times, Landman  gestured in a  way\n\nthat one buyer described as trying to say \"not in front of me.\"\n\n          This  evidence is  sufficient to  support the  district\n\ncourt's  willful blindness  instruction.

On the  facts of this case, we are satisfied\n\nthat the jury could be expected to apply the instruction properly\n\nto defendants  whose conduct arguably calls  for that application\n\nand not randomly or  recklessly to defendants who do  not deserve\n\nthe instruction.  It is common during multi-defendant trials  for\n\nthe  court  to  give  a number  of  boilerplate  instructions  --\n\nconcerning,   for  example,   a  missing   witnesses,  accomplice\n\nliability,  or  withdrawal  from   the  conspiracy  --  that  are\n\npertinent,  on particular facts, to only one defendant and not to\n\nthe  others.   The instruction  in this case  is similar  in many\n\nrespects to  these other instructions and  is equally appropriate\n\ngiven the risk of prejudice  to the other defendants is low.   We\n\ndo  not exclude  the possibility  that, on  particular facts,  it\n\nmight so mislead  a jury  to give a  general instruction,  rather\n\nthan  one  tailored to  a specific  defendant  or rather  than no\n\ninstruction at  all, as  to be  an abuse  of  discretion, but  we\n\nemphasize that judgments  of this kind are primarily entrusted in\n\nthe  trial judge  who  inevitably has  a  superior feel  for  the\n\ndynamics of the trial and the likely reaction of the jury.\n\n          The danger of an improper willful blindness instruction\n\nis  \"'the possibility  that  the jury  will  be led  to  employ a\n\n                               -98-\n\nnegligence standard and convict  a defendant on the impermissible\n\nground  that he  should have  known [an  illegal act]  was taking\n\nplace.'\"  United  States v.

Thus, there was\n\nlittle  risk  that  the  jury  was  confused  into  convicting  a\n\ndefendant  who  merely  should  have  known  about  the  criminal\n\nventure.  See United States v.

See Littlefield, 840  F.2d at 147-48;\n                                           \n\nD az, 864  F.2d at 551.  The court instructed the jury that \"mere\n    \n\nnegligence  or mistake  in  failing to  learn  the facts  is  not\n\nsufficient\" and that  a defendant's willful  ignorance had to  be\n\ndeliberate   beyond  a   reasonable   doubt.     Throughout   the\n\ninstructions,  the court told the jury that the government had to\n\nprove each and  every element  of the  offenses, including  those\n\nelements  requiring knowledge,  beyond a  reasonable doubt.   For\n\nexample, knowing participation in  the scheme to defraud required\n\nthe  actions  of  each  defendant  to  be  \"done  voluntarily and\n\nintentionally  and not  because of  mistake or  accident or  some\n\nother  innocent reason.\"    The court  was  clear that  to  prove\n\nparticipation in a  conspiracy, the government  must show that  a\n\n\"defendant  knew  of  the  existence of  the  conspiracy  and its\n\nunlawful  purpose\"  and  the  court  added  that  \"knowledge  and\n\nwillfulness like  all of the  other elements  of a crime  must be\n\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Twice the district court\n\nexplained that actual proof of knowledge was essential \"to insure\n\nthat no one will be convicted for  an act that he or she did  not\n\nintend to  commit  or the  nature  of which  he  or she  did  not\n\nunderstand.\"\n\n          The instructions,  taken as  a whole,  went a long  way\n\ntoward curing any possible prejudice that may  have resulted from\n\nthe willful blindness instruction.  As evidence of this, the jury\n\ndelivered  verdicts  that demonstrated  it  was  not confused  or\n\naffected by the willful  blindness instruction.  Three defendants\n\n                              -100-\n\nwere acquitted on  multiple bank  fraud counts and  a fourth  was\n\nacquitted  on one  count of  bank fraud.   Defendant  Landman was\n\nacquitted  on one count in which  the principal witness testified\n\nthat  Landman  did not  want to  know  about the  second mortgage\n\ndischarges.  Thus, it appears that the jury declined to apply the\n\nwillful blindness instruction when  it was given the first  clear\n\nopportunity to do so.  We therefore find no error  in the court's\n\ndecision to give a general willful blindness instruction.\n\n              X.  REHEARING OF TESTIMONY BY THE JURY\n\n          Defendant Gauvin assigns error to  the district court's\n\nfailure to read back certain testimony to the jury in response to\n\nthe jury's request.  Four days into the jury's deliberations, the\n\njury  asked to  rehear  several areas  of  testimony.   One  jury\n\nrequest stated:  \"We would  also like to review the testimony  of\n\nMr. Marderosian  concerning  a  meeting   in  which  Mr.  Gauvin,\n\nMr. Granoff and Mr. Brandon  discussed the purchase of  Pidge and\n\nMeeting  Street.\"  As several  references were made  to Pidge and\n\nMeeting Street it  was not  clear which discussion  the jury  was\n\nreferring to.  The court and  the attorneys spent nearly two days\n\ntrying  to cull together the parts of the transcript that related\n\nto all of the requested subject  matter.  At one point, the court\n\nsuggested,  and  the prosecutor  later  argued,  that the  entire\n\ntranscript of  Marderosian's testimony should be  provided to the\n\njury, but counsel for Granoff objected to this suggestion.\n\n          The court read to  the jury a portion  of Marderosian's\n\ntestimony relating to Pidge  and Meeting Street and to  a meeting\n\n                              -101-\n\nwhere  the Pidge project was discussed.  Against the objection of\n\nGauvin's counsel,  the court stopped reading  the transcript just\n\nbefore testimony concerning  additional meetings relating to  the\n\nsame deal as the  one involving Pidge and Meeting  Street but not\n\nspecifically mentioning  Pidge  or Meeting  Street.   We find  no\n\nabuse of discretion  in the  trial judge's decision  not to  read\n\nadditional portions of the transcript. \n\n          The decision  to reread  testimony rests  entirely upon\n\nthe trial  court's sound discretion.

Faced  with a  request for\n\ntestimony  relating to  a meeting  discussing \"Pidge  and Meeting\n\nStreet\" and  faced with multiple references to  Pidge and Meeting\n\nStreet  in  the  record,  the judge  decided  to  read  testimony\n\nconcerning  a meeting where Pidge  was mentioned but  not to read\n\ntestimony relating  to a  subsequent meeting  in which Pidge  and\n\nMeeting Street were  not mentioned.  We find  this decision to be\n\nappropriately within the judge's discretion.\n\n          The fact that the  omitted testimony concerned the same\n\ndeal as the one  involving Pidge and Meeting Street  and the fact\n\n                              -102-\n\nthat  it   also  contained   some  discussion  of   down  payment\n\narrangements  does not suggest any abuse of discretion.  First of\n\nall, to the extent  the omitted testimony is crucial  to Gauvin's\n\ndefense,  as  he  claims,  we  find  the  testimony  to  be  more\n\ninculpatory  in nature  than  exculpatory.76   More  importantly,\n\nthe  judge was  attempting  to respond  appropriately  to a  jury\n\nrequest that  turned out to be  far from narrowly  focussed.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n76  The omitted testimony included the following:\n\n            A.  Mr.  Brandon explained to  Mr. Gauvin\n            and Mr. Granoff that  Homeowners required\n            a  twenty-five  percent down  payment and\n            while  that  down  payment  would  not be\n            required of Mr.  Gauvin and Mr.  Granoff,\n            he  did  have  the  problem  of  the down\n            payment with subsequent purchasers and he\n            asked  Mr. Gauvin  and  Mr.  Granoff  for\n            their assistance in meeting that problem.\n\n            Q.   What,  if anything  did  Mr.  Gauvin\n            respond?\n\n            A.   Mr. Gauvin, as I  recall, initially,\n            didn't quite understand what  Mr. Brandon\n            wanted  and  after  further  explanation,\n            Mr. Gauvin  responded  that  he might  be\n            interested  under  some circumstances  in\n            helping out.\n\n            Q.  What about Mr. Granoff?\n\n            A.  I  believe Mr. Granoff indicated  his\n            consent also.\n\n   Defendant  Gauvin claims  this  testimony was  crucial to  his\ndefense  because   it  corrects  a   mischaracterization  in  the\ngovernment's closing  argument about what Marderosian  said about\nthe down payments.   Defense counsel explicitly told the  jury to\nreview the  testimony regarding the  alleged mischaracterization.\nWe have some doubts,  given the request for a  meeting concerning\n\"Pidge  and Meeting  Streets,\" that  this particular  request was\nrelated  to the issue of the alleged mischaracterization.  In any\nevent, we find  no abuse  of discretion in  the judge's  decision\nthat the omitted material was not what the jury was looking for.\n\n                              -103-\n\nAkitoye, 923 F.2d at 226.  The extra burdens on the court created\n       \n\nby rehearing testimony is  relevant to judging the reasonableness\n\nof the court's  refusal to read back testimony to  the jury.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.   If  the  trial judge  had  searched for  all  the testimony\n  \n\nrelated to the deal involving Pidge and Meeting Street or all the\n\ndiscussions of down payment arrangements for that deal, the judge\n\nwould have had to spend considerably more time and effort than he\n\nhad already expended.  Such extra effort was not required.  \n\n          XI.  REFUSAL TO APPOINT PARALEGAL FOR BRANDON\n\n          Defendant Brandon alleges that the trial court's denial\n\nof his request for a court-appointed paralegal denied him his due\n\nprocess right to present a defense.  Prior to the indictment, the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation took possession of 137 file boxes\n\nfrom Dean Street's offices which contained documents kept by Dean\n\nStreet.  Although Brandon was given complete access to the files,\n\nhe claims  that without the  services of  a paralegal he  and his\n\ncourt-appointed attorney were incapable of meaningfully examining\n\nthe  contents of  the files,  effectively denying  him access  to\n\npotentially exculpatory  evidence.  Brandon and  his attorney did\n\nspend four hours one afternoon examining the contents of three of\n\nthe file boxes.\n\n          Defendant cites Brady v.  Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963),\n                                            \n\nand its progeny for  the proposition that his due  process rights\n\nwere  violated.   Brady requires  the government to  disclose any\n                       \n\nexculpatory  evidence  that is  \"material either  to guilt  or to\n\npunishment.\"   Brady, 373 U.S. at  87.

In  his initial  request before the  trial court  and\n\nsubsequently on  appeal, the  defendant speculated that  the Dean\n\nStreet files  might contain exculpatory evidence.   Brandon never\n\npresented,  however,  any  supporting  evidence  or  arguments to\n\nindicate this was,  in fact, the  case.  Because Brandon  did not\n\nmake  any  showing  at  all  as to  the  nature  of  the disputed\n\nmaterials, we find no  error in the court's refusal to  appoint a\n\nparalegal for Brandon's defense.\n\n          This  is not  a Catch-22  situation in  which defendant\n\ncannot make the initial showing needed to get a paralegal without\n\nfirst having a paralegal to assist in making the initial showing.\n\n                              -105-\n\nInstead, the  defendant can  establish the possible  existence of\n\nmaterial  and  exculpatory  evidence   by,  at  the  very  least,\n\ndescribing the kinds of  documents that might be in  files which,\n\nif  they were found, might  exculpate the defendant.77   At most,\n\ndefendant and  counsel  could have  spent a  few more  afternoons\n\nlooking in the files for representative samples of documents that\n\nmight be useful to the defense.  We do not think this  places too\n\nmuch of a burden on defendant or defendant's counsel.\n\n                XII.  CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ERRORS\n\n          Defendants argue that the cumulative effect of numerous\n\nalleged  errors made before and during the trial deprived them of\n\na fair trial and enabled the  jury to convict despite the lack of\n\nevidence against each  individual defendant.

This example was  not pointed out to the  trial judge.\nEven if the  example was  presented at trial,  however, it  would\nprobably not, by itself, be sufficient to establish the existence\nof   material  exculpatory   evidence  without   some  additional\nsubstantiation.

The court  then included\n\nthe  entire amount  of  the  loss  in  the  calculation  of  each\n\ndefendant's offense  level under    2F1.1.   The resulting  total\n\noffense level was set by adding an 11-level  increase to the base\n\noffense  level because  the total  loss was over  $5,000,000, the\n\nhighest  point on  the  loss  scale at  that  time.

At this hearing, the court heard  testimony\n\nby Bay Loan's president and a real estate appraiser called by the\n\ndefense.  The court also reviewed exhibits containing information\n\non the value of each of the motel condominiums.  Defendants argue\n\nthat the  $2.7 million dollar figure  chosen by the  court as the\n\ntotal value of  the collateral (the motels) was  improperly based\n\non a  1991 appraisal as opposed to  an earlier 1989 appraisal for\n\n$7.8  million.    Defendant  seems  to  argue  that  the  earlier\n\nappraisal is the more accurate one because  it was made closer to\n\nthe time of the  crime and because  the latter appraisal is  more\n\nlikely to be  affected by  causes not related  to the actions  of\n\ndefendants.   Given  the  evidentiary basis  -- a  professionally\n\nprepared  appraisal --  for  the trial  court's determination  of\n\nloss, however, we do not see any error, let alone clear error, in\n\nthe court's  decision  to  choose  the  lower  valuation  of  the\n\ncollateral. \n\n          A  more significant  objection  raised by  many of  the\n\ndefendants  is that the court improperly assigned to each of them\n\nthe  entire value  of  the loss  regardless  of their  degree  of\n\nparticipation  in the scheme to defraud Bay Loan.

The  Guidelines go on to\npoint out  that \"the criminal activity that  the defendant agreed\nto jointly  undertake, and the reasonably  foreseeable conduct of\nothers  in  furtherance  of   that  criminal  activity,  are  not\nnecessarily  identical.\"  Id.  In other words, one can reasonably\n                            \nforesee conduct in furtherance of an agreed upon  enterprise even\nthough  one did not specifically agree to join in that particular\nconduct.  Id.\n            \n\n                              -109-\n\nnot necessarily the same  as the scope of the  entire conspiracy,\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3  comment note  2, 1993 Guidelines,  there is  no\n\nreason why a defendant cannot intend to join and thus foresee the\n\noperation  of   the  entire   conspiracy.    As   the  Guidelines\n\nacknowledge,   the  two   can   be  coterminous,   although  \"not\n\nnecessarily\" so.\n\n          In  this case, the district court did find the scope of\n\nthe  conspiracy  and the  scope  of  the  foreseeable conduct  in\n\nfurtherance  of  each  defendant's  jointly  undertaken  criminal\n\nactivity  to  be  the  same.    The  judge  held  the  defendants\n\nresponsible for \"acts of co-conspirators to the extent that those\n\nacts were  committed in furtherance  of the  conspiracy and  were\n\nknown  to or reasonably foreseeable by the Defendant.\"  The judge\n\nthen  recited  all  the  actions taken  by  each  defendant which\n\nindicated  they were  involved  in  the  entire  breadth  of  the\n\nconspiracy.80    Most telling  is  the  judge's statement  during\n\nsentencing that \"the agreement that each [defendant] entered into\n\nwas  to participate in a  continuing scheme to  obtain loans from\n\nBay Loan  by means  of fraudulent misrepresentations.\"   Although\n\nthe sentencing judge  did not employ all  the expository language\n\nrecently added to the  Guidelines, it is evident from  the record\n\nthat  he conducted the proper analysis.   We thus see no error in\n\n                    \n\n80   This is not a  case where the sentencing  court merely found\nthat the  defendant \"knew what was  going on.\"  See  O'Campo, 973\n                                                            \nF.2d  at 1025.   The judge in this  case recounted specific facts\nregarding  each individual  defendant which  indicated that  each\ndefendant  embraced the full scope  of the scheme  to defraud Bay\nLoan.

Each claims the court  should have\n\nreduced by some unspecified amount  the loss attributable to  him\n\nor  her as  relevant  conduct.    The  determination  of  what  a\n\ndefendant can  foresee for  the purposes of  determining relevant\n\nconduct at sentencing is inherently fact-bound and, consequently,\n\nreviewable only  for clear error.   United States  v. Innamorati,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          All the defendants, except Hagopian, Ward  and Kumalae,\n\nwere  involved in the  scheme to defraud  Bay Loan from  the very\n\nbeginning.    Before  the  scheme  was  first  executed,  Brandon\n\ndiscussed  with Reisch methods  to avoid making  down payments on\n\nthe end  loans.   The first  unit sales were  made to  Gauvin and\n\nGranoff  with Landman acting as escrow agent.  The involvement of\n\nthese defendants continued  throughout the scheme and we  find no\n\nclearly discernable limits  to the scope of  the criminal venture\n\nin  which they agreed to participate such that the district court\n\nerred in finding all the losses from the entire conspiracy  to be\n\nforeseeable.   The fact that  Gauvin and Granoff  stopped lending\n\ndown payment funds after  February of 1988 does not  absolve them\n\nof responsibility for the continued actions of  the conspiracy to\n\nobtain more  loans from Bay Loan.   The issue is  not whether the\n\ntwo continued to  commit acts  in furtherance of  the scheme  but\n\nwhether, at  the time  of the relevant  conduct, they  reasonably\n\n                              -111-\n\ncould  have  foreseen the  actions of  the  other members  of the\n\nconspiracy.       The   evidence,    particularly   the   ongoing\n\ncorrespondence with  Brandon made until  the end  of the  scheme,\n\nclearly indicates that  Gauvin and Granoff not only could foresee\n\nthe continued sale of condominium units, they actually knew about\n\nit.81\n\n          We have  recently held that a  defendant's base offense\n\nlevel cannot be based  on knowledge of historic facts.   O'Campo,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at  1022-26.  Thus,  with respect to Hagopian,  Ward and\n\nKumalae, losses attributable to fraudulent activity that occurred\n\nbefore  they   became  involved  in  the   conspiracy  cannot  be\n\nconsidered as relevant  conduct.   See id.   The judge's  error82\n                                         \n\nin  this regard, however, had no effect  on their sentences so we\n\nfind no reason for reversal on this issue.\n\n          Hagopian  and  Ward  did  not become  involved  in  the\n\n                    \n\n81  We disagree with Gauvin and Granoff that the evidence clearly\nindicates some kind of withdrawal from the conspiracy so that the\nscope  of the  criminal venture  in which  they  participated was\nlimited  to something less than the entire conspiracy.  The trial\njudge carefully considered this  issue and we see no  clear error\nin his rejection of their arguments.\n\n   Similar arguments are made by Hagopian, Ward and Reisch to the\neffect that they were not responsible for sales arranged by other\nbrokers  or  funded  by  other  people.    These   arguments  are\nunavailing.  The  defendants agreed to participate in  the entire\noperation,  even  though  their  individual role  may  have  been\nlimited  to  a  specific  function  within  the  broader  scheme.\nConsequently, only a showing of  the foreseeability of the  other\nco-conspirators'   conduct  is  required  to  find  that  conduct\nrelevant  for  sentencing  purposes.     That  standard,  as  the\nsentencing judge correctly found, was clearly met.\n\n82  We  note that, to  the district judge's  credit, the  O'Campo\n                                                                 \ndecision  settling this issue was not handed down until after the\njudge conducted the sentencing of the defendants in this case.\n\n                              -112-\n\nconspiracy  until  after  October  of  1987,  after  all  of  the\n\nCharlestown  units had already been  sold.  Kumalae  did not join\n\nuntil after some units had already been sold  at the Bayside, the\n\nsecond motel  involved in the  scheme.  It  may well be  arguable\n\nthat the total losses to Bay Loan resulted from conduct occurring\n                     \n\nafter  the  participation  of   these  three  defendants.    When\n\nHagopian, Ward  and Kumalae joined the  conspiracy, payments were\n\nbeing  made on the  end loans.   It was  not until the  scheme to\n\ndefraud expanded to more and more condominium units that it began\n\nto  collapse under its own  weight as additional  loan funds from\n\nBay Loan were required to pay off  the existing obligations.  The\n\nconduct of Hagopian, Ward  and Kumalae, therefore, contributed to\n\nthe overall losses to  Bay Loan which took  place when the  loans\n\ndefaulted.\n\n          More importantly, however, even if the losses resulting\n\nfrom the loans  made for  the Charlestown and  Bayside units  are\n\nexcluded  from  the  loss  calculation  for  Hagopian,  Ward  and\n\nKumalae,  the  total would  still be  well  over $5  million, the\n\nhighest level  under the  1988 version  of U.S.S.G.    2F1.1.   A\n\nlion's share of the loans  were made for units in the  five other\n\nmotels  after  all  the  defendants had  joined  the  conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, any error in  apportioning losses was harmless because\n\nit   did  not  affect   the  offense   level  assigned   to  each\n\ndefendant.83\n\n                    \n\n83  We also find no error in the district court's refusal to take\ninto account multiple causes for Bay Loan's losses in determining\nthe  sentences.     \"'[T]he  victim  loss  table  in  U.S.S.G.   \n\n                              -113-\n\n      B.

In any event,\n\nthe judge made more than adequate findings based on the record to\n\nsupport  his  decision.   The  judge  found  that  Ward took  the\n\ninitiative  to find buyers for the scheme and helped falsify down\n\npayments which constituted \"repeated acts\" over a period of time.\n\nWard protests that there  is no evidence that he  \"initiated\" any\n\nof the contacts  with the buyers.  This is  mere quibbling.  Ward\n\nwas actively involved in the recruitment process, he told  buyers\n\nno  down payments were required,  he told buyers  to provide down\n\npayments  checks that  he knew  would not  be negotiated,  and he\n\nprovided buyers with  rebates for  their purchases.   Any one  of\n\nthese  facts  would  support  a  finding  of  more  than  minimal\n\nplanning. \n\n          As for defendant Granoff, the district court found that\n\nthe scheme to  defraud Bay  Loan involved more  planning than  is\n\n                              -115-\n\ntypical  for  commission  of  the  offense  in  its  simple form.\n\nLooking at the scheme as a whole, this fact is indisputable.  But\n\nthis  fact is  also  true when  viewed  from the  perspective  of\n\nGranoff's specific  involvement.  Granoff first  met with Brandon\n\nin  the summer  of 1987  to discuss  the condominium  project and\n\neventually he agreed  to purchase  some units and  to fund  buyer\n\ndown  payments.   Pursuant to  this agreement,  Granoff purchased\n\nfour units in August of  1987 in which funds were recycled  via a\n\nsophisticated  arrangement.    Five  months  later,  he  provided\n\n$470,000 to Dean Street on the understanding it would be returned\n\nto him  after it was used to fund buyers' down payments.  Granoff\n\nalso  formed  a partnership  with Gauvin  to  invest in  the Dean\n\nStreet project.   All of these  activities reflect a  significant\n\nlevel of involvement in the  scheme.  We therefore find no  error\n\nin his case.\n\n          Finally,   the  sentencing  judge  found  that  Landman\n\nengaged  in  \"repeated acts\"  during the  scheme  in his  role as\n\nescrow  agent   or  closing  attorney   for  most  of   the  loan\n\ntransactions.  There is no basis for any error in his case.\n\n  C.  Denial of Role-In-The-Offense Decrease for Marvin Granoff\n\n          Defendant Granoff claims the  court erred in finding he\n\nwas not a minor  participant and thus not entitled to  a decrease\n\nin his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G   3B1.2(b).  \"[A]  minor\n\nparticipant means  any participant who is less culpable than most\n\nother  participants.\" U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b)  comment note  3, 1993\n\nGuidelines.  No defendant,  however, is automatically entitled to\n\n                              -116-\n\na  reduction, even if the  defendant happens to  be less culpable\n\nthan his or her co-defendants.

The sentencing court has broad\n\ndiscretion  in determining  whether  this downward  departure  is\n\nappropriate   and  we   will   reverse  only   if  the   evidence\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant played a part that\n\nmakes   him  substantially   less  culpable   than  the   average\n\nparticipant  in  the  convicted  offense such  that  the  court's\n\ndecision  was  clearly erroneous.

We\n\nfind  that the record  supports the court's  finding that Granoff\n\nwas not less culpable than most of the other defendants let alone\n\nsubstantially  less culpable  than  an average  defendant and  we\n\ntherefore affirm Granoff's sentence.85\n\n                    \n\n85    Granoff also  claims  that the  district  court erroneously\nfailed  to  depart  downward  based   on  his  age  and  physical\ncondition, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5H1.1 and   5H1.4.

We therefore reverse the imposition\n\nof supervised release costs on defendants Brandon, Ward, Landman,\n\nHagopian, and Kumalae.\n\n          Brandon further argues that because he is indigent, the\n\ndistrict court was without  authority to order him to  pay either\n\nrestitution or the  statutory assessments.  In  imposing an order\n\nof restitution,  the district court  must consider  not only  the\n\namount  of the victim's loss but also \"the financial resources of\n\nthe  defendant, the financial  needs and  earning ability  of the\n\ndefendant and the defendant's  dependents, and such other factors\n\nas the court  deems appropriate.\"   18 U.S.C.    3664(a);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Specifically, the\n\njudge  stated:   \"[I]n arriving  at that  figure, Mr.  Brandon, I\n\nrecognize that based on the pre-sentence report, you don't appear\n\nto have  any assets at the  present time but it  appears that you\n\nhave the prospect of  receiving or inheriting some assets  in the\n\nfuture.\"   The court also  noted that a  man of Brandon's talents\n\n                              -118-\n\nought to be able to obtain gainful employment upon release.\n\n          Although the  restitution order may be  burdensome, and\n\nalthough it  may be true to  some extent that \"if  a defendant is\n\nindigent  for purposes  of one  [fine], he  must be  indigent for\n\npurposes of the other.\"  United States v.

Corral  dealt specifically  with  the interplay  of two\n                \n\nprovisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G.  \n\n5E1.2(a) and    5E1.2(i).  Corral, 964  F.2d at 84.   We found in\n                                 \n\nthat case that because  the fine imposed under   5E1.2(i)  was an\n\nadditional fine  to be instituted  only in  conjunction with  the\n\npunitive fine imposed under    5E1.2(a), the former could  not be\n\nimposed  once  the  latter  was  waived  because  of  defendant's\n\nindigency.   Id.  In the case of restitution, however, a separate\n               \n\nstatutory  scheme has  been  established which  includes its  own\n\nindependent  consideration of  defendant's  ability to  pay.   18\n\nU.S.C.   3664.  Therefore,  the district court's determination of\n\nindigency  under  U.S.S.G    5E1.2(a)  in  the  present  case  is\n\nindependent of and does not affect its ruling on restitution.86\n\n          The judgments are affirmed  except that the judgment of\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n86    To the  extent Brandon  also  challenges the  $50 statutory\nassessment  fee imposed  for each count  (totaling $1300)  by the\ndistrict court pursuant to  18 U.S.C.   3013,  we find no  error.\nThe assessment fee is  mandatory; the judge has no  discretion to\nwaive  it based on  the defendant's ability  to pay  nor does the\nConstitution require him to do so.
