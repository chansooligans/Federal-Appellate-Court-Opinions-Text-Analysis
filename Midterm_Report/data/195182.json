This $2  million\n                                         \n\nplus  lawsuit against the United States and several employees\n\nthereof  stems  from  an  incident  outside  Gate  1  of  the\n\nRoosevelt Roads Navy  Station in Puerto Rico on  the night of\n\nJuly  9, 1990.  Plaintiff Jorge Melendez-Felix (Melendez) and\n\nothers1 were  arrested and, allegedly, mistreated before they\n\nwere  released.  This  action was  commenced on  February 25,\n\n1992,  and dismissed,  on motion  of defendants, on  June 25,\n\n1993.  We affirm.\n\n          We  consider first the  F.T.C.A. action against the\n\nUnited States.   28 U.S.C.     2671-2680.  A single  claim on\n\nStandard   Form   95  naming   plaintiff   and  another   was\n\nacknowledged  by  the  proper agency  on  February  21, 1991.\n\nCounsel was  immediately sent new  blank forms with  a letter\n\nstating in  detail the  necessary requirements.   The  letter\n\nreferred to counsel  as having clients (plural),  and stated,\n\n\"Each claimant has to fill [sic] a separate form.\"  (Emphasis\n     \n\nin orig.)   However, no response was made, and the agency, by\n\nletter  of October  1, 1991,  stated,  \"[T]he claim  of Jorge\n\nMelendez-Felix and  Idalia Robles  Suarez is hereby  denied.\"\n\nThe  letter concluded  \"they may file  suit . . .  within six\n\nmonths.\"\n\n                    \n\n1.  Some of the others  originally participated herein,  but,\nfor  various reasons,  they have  fallen by  the wayside  and\nMelendez is the sole appellant.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Plaintiffs'  action against  the United  States was\n\ntimely  filed  with Melendez  as  a  plaintiff, but  with  no\n\nmention of  Miss Robles  Suarez.  In  granting the  motion to\n\ndismiss Melendez's action the court accepted the government's\n\ncontention  that it had no jurisdiction because of Melendez's\n\nfailure to specify a sum certain on his claim.  This followed\n\nlong settled law.  28 C.F.R.    14.2(a); Corte Real v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 949  F.2d 484, 485-86  (1st Cir. 1981); see  Adams v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 615 F.2d 284, 291-92 n.15, clarified, 622 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n197 (5th Cir. 1980).  This  requirement is to aid the  agency\n\nto  evaluate the  claim for  settlement purposes.   Swift  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited  States,  614 F.2d  812,  814  (1st  Cir. 1980).    So\n              \n\nimportant is it  considered that if a figure  is not supplied\n\nthe court lacks  jurisdiction.  Corte Real, 949  F.2d at 485-\n                                          \n\n86.  See Lopez v. United States,  758 F.2d 806, 808 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1985).\n\n          The  form 95  submitted by  counsel  gave a  single\n\ndollar  figure.  Melendez's position is that this represented\n\nhis  personal  claim  only  because  only  he  was  named  as\n\nclaimant; if Idalia  Robles Suarez appeared to  be a claimant\n\nalso, it  \"was obviously  a clerical error.\"   There  are two\n\nanswers to this.  The first is that it did not appear to be a\n\nmere clerical error.  Question 2 as printed on the form read,\n\n\"Name,  address of  claimant.\"   To the  word  claimant, when\n\nsubmitted,  there was added  the letter  \"s\", and  the answer\n\n                             -4-\n\ngiven  was  \"JORGE  MELENDEZ-FELIX  AND  MISS  IDALIA  ROBLES\n\nSUAREZ.\"  This  was more than a typographical  slip.  Second,\n\nif there was an error,  the error was conspicuously not clear\n\nto the  agency.   In addition to  \"Each claimant,\"  ante, the\n                                                        \n\nacknowledgement  letter to counsel twice spoke of his clients\n\nwith an \"s\".  Reading this form and this  letter together, no\n\ncounsel  could reasonably think he had submitted an \"obvious\"\n\nsingle  claim.   Nor  should he  overlook  the agency  letter\n\nspecifying the need for a \"specific dollar amount,\" which was\n\nalready done, had there been but one claimant.\n\n          When counsel failed to respond  in any way in spite\n\nof the letter's  saying, \"We cannot  stress too strongly  the\n\nimportance of accurate and  thorough completion,\" the  agency\n\nultimately denied the  claim.  Plaintiff, properly,  does not\n\nassert  a  waiver   of  plaintiff's  failure  to   supply  an\n\nindividual claim figure.   It being jurisdictional,  ante, it\n                                                         \n\ncould not  be waived.   We would be bucking  established, and\n\nimportant, government procedure if we were to hold otherwise.\n\n          The  other defendants remaining in the case are the\n\nindividual government  employees who participated in the July\n\nincident.  Here  plaintiff's claim is predicated  upon Bivens\n                                                             \n\nv. Six Unknown  Federal Agents, 403 U.S.  388 (1971).  As  to\n                              \n\nthis the action was brought  after the Puerto Rico statute of\n\nlimitations would normally  have run.  Under Puerto Rico law,\n\nthe statute of limitations is tolled if plaintiff has, before\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe time  expired, expressed  his intention  of pursuing  his\n\nclaim, DeJesus  v. Chardon, 116  D.P.R. 238, 116  D.P.R. 290,\n                          \n\n301 (1985)  (translation), or  if plaintiff  has asserted  an\n\n\"extrajudicial  claim\" within Article 1873 of the Civil Code.\n\n31  P.R.L.A.   5303.   Further, under  certain circumstances,\n\nmaking  such an expression  to one obligee  may automatically\n\ntoll  it  as to  others.    31  P.R.L.A.   5304;  Fuentes  v.\n                                                         \n\nDistrict Court, 73 D.P.R.  959, 73 D.P.R. 893, 907-08  (1952)\n              \n\n(translation).  On this theory plaintiff says that filing the\n\n95 form with  the government tolled the statute  with respect\n\nto the other  defendants.  We  hold otherwise.   Even in  the\n\ncontext of  a single  defendant, \"tolling  is effective  with\n\nregard  only to  identical  causes  of  action.\"    Rodriguez\n                                                             \n\nNarvaez  v.  Nazario,  895  F.2d  38,  43  (1st  Cir.  1990);\n                    \n\nFernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d  42, 49 (1st Cir. 1982), aff'd\n                                                             \n\nsub nom  Chardon v. Fumero  Soto, 462  U.S. 650 (1983).   The\n                                \n\nrule can be no broader for co-defendants.  Plaintiff sued the\n\nUnited States under the Federal  Tort Claims Act for a common\n\nlaw tort.  Under Bivens he sued the individual defendants for\n                       \n\nviolation  of  his  constitutional rights.    These  are very\n\ndifferent claims.  The fact that the same facts were involved\n\nis not determinative.  Cf. Fernandez, 681 F.2d at 49.\n                                    \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -6-\n",

However, no response was made, and the agency, by letter of October 1, 1991, stated, \"[T]he claim of Jorge Melendez-Felix and Idalia Robles Suarez is hereby denied.\"  The letter concluded \"they may file suit ... within six months.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' action against the United States was timely filed with Melendez as a plaintiff, but with no mention of Miss Robles Suarez.

This followed long settled law.  28 C.F.R. Sec. 14.2(a);   Corte Real v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></span>, 485-86 (1st Cir. 1981);   see Adams v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374709\"><a href=\"/opinion/374709/gary-l-adams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 291-92 n. 15, clarified, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378266\"><a href=\"/opinion/378266/gary-l-adams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1980).  This requirement is to aid the agency to evaluate the claim for settlement purposes.   Swift v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374297\"><a href=\"/opinion/374297/avis-e-swift-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 814 (1st Cir. 1980).  So important is it considered that if a figure is not supplied the court lacks jurisdiction.   Corte Real, 949 F.2d at 485-86.   See Lopez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450375\"><a href=\"/opinion/450375/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 808 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The form 95 submitted by counsel gave a single dollar figure.  Melendez's position is that this represented his personal claim only because only he was named as claimant;  if Idalia Robles Suarez appeared to be a claimant also, it \"was obviously a clerical error.\"  There are two answers to this.  The first is that it did not appear to be a mere clerical error.  Question 2 as printed on the form read, \"Name, address of claimant.\"  To the word claimant, when submitted, there was added the letter \"s\", and the answer given was \"JORGE MELENDEZ-FELIX AND MISS IDALIA ROBLES SUAREZ.\"  This was more than a typographical slip.  Second, if there was an error, the error was conspicuously not clear to the agency.  In addition to \"Each claimant,\" ante, the acknowledgement letter to counsel twice spoke of his clients with an \"s\".  Reading this form and this letter together, no counsel could reasonably think he had submitted an \"obvious\" single claim.  Nor should he overlook the agency letter specifying the need for a \"specific dollar amount,\" which was already done, had there been but one claimant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When counsel failed to respond in any way in spite of the letter's saying, \"We cannot stress too strongly the importance of accurate and thorough completion,\" the agency ultimately denied the claim.  Plaintiff, properly, does not assert a waiver of plaintiff's failure to supply an individual claim figure.  It being jurisdictional, ante, it could not be waived.  We would be bucking established, and important, government procedure if we were to hold otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other defendants remaining in the case are the individual government employees who participated in the July incident.  Here plaintiff's claim is predicated upon  Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Agents, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (1971).  As to this the action was brought after the Puerto Rico statute of limitations would normally have run.  Under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations is tolled if plaintiff has, before the time expired, expressed his intention of pursuing his claim, DeJesus v. Chardon, 116 D.P.R. 238, 116 D.P.R. 290, 301 (1985) (translation), or if plaintiff has asserted an \"extrajudicial claim\" within Article 1873 of the Civil Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">31 P.R.L.A. Sec. 5303.  Further, under certain circumstances, making such an expression to one obligee may automatically toll it as to others.  31 P.R.L.A. Sec. 5304;  Fuentes v. District Court, 73 D.P.R. 959, 73 D.P.R. 893, 907-08 (1952) (translation).  On this theory plaintiff says that filing the 95 form with the government tolled the statute with respect to the other defendants.  We hold otherwise.  Even in the context of a single defendant, \"tolling is effective with regard only to identical causes of action.\"   Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536032\"><a href=\"/opinion/536032/alicia-rodriguez-narvaez-v-ariel-nazario-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1990);   Fernandez v. Chardon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405331\"><a href=\"/opinion/405331/rafael-rivera-fernandez-v-carlos-chardon-etc-juan-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 1982),  aff'd sub nom Chardon v. Fumero Soto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110977\"><a href=\"/opinion/110977/chardon-v-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span> (1983).  The rule can be no broader for co-defendants.  Plaintiff sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act for a common law tort.  Under Bivens he sued the individual defendants for violation of his constitutional rights.  These are very different claims.  The fact that the same facts were involved is not determinative.   Cf. Fernandez, 681 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Some of the others originally participated herein, but, for various reasons, they have fallen by the wayside and Melendez is the sole appellant</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
