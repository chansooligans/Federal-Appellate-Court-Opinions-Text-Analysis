Civ.  P. 56 requires.   See, e.g.,  Amsden v. Moran,  904 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n748, 749 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1041 (1991).\n                                      \n\n          Appellant, a known member  of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP), started working for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the\n\n1960s.   By 1984,  she occupied  a career  position in  the State\n\nInsurance  Fund (SIF), a government agency.1  In November of that\n\nyear, the incumbent NPP  governor lost the gubernatorial election\n\nto a member of the rival Popular Democratic Party (PDP).   Hot on\n\nthe  heels of the change in command two PDP loyalists, defendants\n\nCirilo  Tirado-Delgado   (Tirado)  and  Rafael   Rivera  Gonzalez\n\n(Rivera),  received  high-level  SIF  appointments     Tirado  as\n\nAdministrator of the SIF, Rivera as Director of Personnel.\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant  served as executive  assistant to SIF's Director\nof  Administrative Services.  The defendants  did not urge below,\nand have not  contended on appeal, that political  affiliation is\nan appropriate criterion for this position.\n\n                                3\n\n          Once ensconced at the  agency, the defendants allegedly\n\ninformed  appellant that  she  would be  demoted  because of  her\n\npolitical affiliation.  The  prophecy soon became a reality.   By\n\nletter dated  June 20,  1985, Rivera  advised appellant that  her\n\nposition  was   being  eliminated  as  part   of  a  departmental\n\nreorganization  and that, consequently, she was being transferred\n\nto a different SIF position  as assistant to the Director  of the\n\nSystems and Procedures Office.  Rivera's letter acknowledged that\n\n\"[t]his transfer represents a demotion.\"\n\n          Although  the  defendants now  struggle to  portray the\n\nreassignment as a lateral transfer, the record bears out Rivera's\n\ninitial characterization  of  the  move.   The  base  salary  for\n\nappellant's  new  position ($1565  per  month) was  significantly\n\nlower than the  base salary  for her former  position ($1915  per\n\nmonth).  The terms of her employment provided that, until the gap\n\nwas closed, she would continue to be paid at her accustomed rate,\n\nbut the difference between her new base salary and her actual pay\n\nwould  absorb any raises or bonuses she otherwise would have been\n\neligible to collect.  Thus, while appellant's pay was not reduced\n\noutright,  it was effectively frozen and her ability to earn more\n\nmoney was  circumscribed.  This  situation lasted at  least until\n\nFebruary 3, 1987,  when Tirado informed appellant by letter that,\n\nin terms of salary and classification, her new position was being\n\nupgraded to the level of her previous position.\n\n          The demotion  damaged appellant's pride as  well as her\n\npocketbook.   Her  new job,  unlike her old  one, did  not entail\n\n                                4\n\nsupervisory  responsibilities.   What  is more,  even the  modest\n\nfunctions  and duties  corresponding to  the new  job title  were\n\nplaced beyond her reach as she was asked to perform only clerical\n\ntasks.   As a final  indignity, although the defendants abolished\n\nappellant's  former position  on  paper, its  functions  remained\n\nessentially intact and were performed by an employee with ties to\n\nthe PDP.\n\n          Asserting that she had been  constructively discharged,\n\nor,  alternatively,  demoted because  of  her  exercise of  First\n\nAmendment  rights,  and  contending  that the  adverse  personnel\n\nactions  undertaken  at  defendants'  direction  deprived her  of\n\nproperty without due process of law, appellant brought suit under\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983  (1988).  She sought  both equitable relief  and\n\nmoney  damages.  The district court gave her cold gruel, entering\n\nsummary judgment in defendants' favor on all claims.  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n                                A\n                                 \n\n                         Summary Judgment\n                                         \n\n          Summary judgment exists to  \"pierce the boilerplate  of\n\nthe  pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine\n\nwhether trial is actually  required.\"  Wynne v. Tufts  Univ. Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nof  Medicine, 976  F.2d 791,  794 (1st  Cir. 1992),  petition for\n                                                                 \n\ncert.  filed, 61 U.S.L.W. 3586 (U.S. Feb. 3, 1993) (No. 92-1334).\n            \n\nSuch   a  disposition   is   appropriate  when   \"the  pleadings,\n\n                                5\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories,  and admissions on file,\n\ntogether  with  the affidavits,  if any,  show  that there  is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any  material fact and that the moving  party\n\nis entitled to  judgment as a  matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P.\n\n56(c).   A genuine issue exists when there is evidence sufficient\n\nto  support rational resolution of  the point in  favor of either\n\nparty.  See, e.g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n                                                  \n\n248 (1986); United States  v. One Parcel of Real  Property, Etc.,\n                                                                \n\n960 F.2d 200,  204 (1st Cir.  1992).  A genuinely  disputed issue\n\nconcerns  a material  fact  if  the  fact  carries  with  it  the\n\npotential  to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable\n\nlaw.  See Anderson,  477 U.S. at 248; Rivera-Muriente  v. Agosto-\n                                                                 \n\nAlicea,  959 F.2d  349,  352 (1st  Cir.  1992).   This  framework\n      \n\nremains  intact when  qualified  immunity  issues  are  presented\n\ndespite the potential of such defenses, in other ways, to \"create\n\nstrange procedural configurations.\"  Amsden, 904 F.2d at 752.\n                                           \n\n          Because  the granting  of summary  judgment necessarily\n\ninvolves  applying  a legal  standard  to  facts which  must,  by\n\ndefinition, be  undisputed, appellate review of  a district court\n\norder under  Rule 56 is  plenary.   See Wynne, 976  F.2d at  794;\n                                             \n\nAmsden, 904 F.2d at 752.\n      \n\n                                B\n                                 \n\n                      Constructive Discharge\n                                            \n\n          We  need  not   tarry  over  appellant's  most   touted\n\ninitiative:  her claim that she  was constructively discharged in\n\nreprisal for the free exercise of her First Amendment rights.  We\n\n                                6\n\nhave ruled, squarely and recently, that a \"claim of  constructive\n\ndischarge due to  a demotion  or transfer cannot  succeed when  a\n\nclaimant, in  fact,  has  not  left employment.\"    Pedro-Cos  v.\n                                                             \n\nContreras,  976  F.2d   83,  85  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (per  curiam)\n         \n\n(collecting cases); accord Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  34,  37  (1st Cir.  1993).    In  this instance,  appellant\n\nconcedes that she never  left the SIF payroll.   Accordingly, her\n\nconstructive discharge claim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                                C\n                                 \n\n                      Transfer and Demotion\n                                           \n\n          Next, appellant  claims  that she  was transferred  and\n\ndemoted for the same  (impermissible) reason:  to punish  her for\n\nexercising  prerogatives  of   free  association  and   the  like\n\nguaranteed to her by the First Amendment.   Because this claim is\n\nscissile, its component parts are best treated separately.\n\n     The Claim for Money Damages\n                                \n\n          Insofar  as  appellant's First  Amendment transfer-and-\n\ndemotion claim is one for  compensatory damages, we conclude that\n\nthe  doctrine of  qualified  immunity bars  recovery.   Qualified\n\nimmunity  shields  government officials  performing discretionary\n\nfunctions  from  civil liability  for  money  damages when  their\n\nconduct  does  not  violate \"clearly  established\"  statutory  or\n\nconstitutional  rights of  which a  reasonable person  would have\n\nknown.   Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 800,  818 (1982).   The\n                              \n\ndetermination is time-critical.  See, e.g., Goyco de Maldonado v.\n                                                              \n\nRivera, 849 F.2d 683, 684 (1st Cir. 1988).  Here, the key actions\n      \n\n                                7\n\nof which appellant  complains occurred before  1989.  This  court\n\nhad not yet decided Agosto-De-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1209 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc)  and the Supreme Court had not yet\n\ndecided  Rutan v. Republican Party  of Illinois, 110  S. Ct. 2729\n                                               \n\n(1990).  As  we explain  below, this chronology  gets the  grease\n\nfrom the goose.\n\n          Before 1989,  that is,  throughout the period  when the\n\npresent defendants allegedly acted  to appellant's detriment,2 it\n\nwas  a  subject of  much  conjecture  whether the  constitutional\n\nprohibition  against  politically motivated  firings  extended to\n\nother personnel actions, such as refusals to hire, demotions, and\n\nfailures to  promote.    See  Rodriguez-Pinto, 982  F.2d  at  38;\n                                             \n\nAviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1992); Roque-\n                                                                 \n\nRodriguez v. Lema  Moya, 926  F.2d 103, 107-09  (1st Cir.  1991);\n                       \n\nNunez-Soto  v. Alvarado, 918 F.2d 1029, 1030 (1st Cir. 1990).  In\n                       \n\nthe absence of a clearly established  right on the part of public\n\nemployees   even civil  servants   to engage in  politics without\n\nfear of demotion, the irresistible conclusion is that the instant\n\ndefendants are  entitled to don the cloak  of qualified immunity.\n\nTherefore, the  lower  court appropriately  scotched  appellant's\n\n                    \n\n     2The  record is  tenebrous  as to  whether petty  harassment\n(e.g.,  shortstopping of responsibilities)  continued after 1989.\n     \nBut, it is  apparent that,  by then, the  major hardships  (e.g.,\n                                                                \nreduced compensation) had been ameliorated.  Thus, there seems to\nbe little  basis for  arguing that, in  1989, Agosto-De-Feliciano\n                                                                 \nstripped the cloak of qualified immunity from the defendants vis-\na-vis  any  remnants  of   the  alleged  mistreatment  thereafter\noccurring,  and, indeed, appellant  has made no  such argument on\nappeal.\n\n                                8\n\nclaim for compensatory damages at the summary judgment stage.3\n\n     The Claim for Equitable Relief\n                                   \n\n          The remaining  furculum of appellant's  First Amendment\n\ntransfer-and-demotion claim  has  more  meat on  its  bones.    A\n\nprimary purpose of providing officials with qualified immunity is\n\nto  ensure that  fear  of  personal  liability  will  not  unduly\n\ninfluence or inhibit  their performance of  public duties.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Anderson v. Creighton,  483 U.S. 635,  638 (1987); Harlow,\n                                                                \n\n457 U.S.  at 814; Carlson v.  Green, 446 U.S. 14,  21 n.7 (1980).\n                                   \n\nThis  purpose is achieved when the official is held harmless from\n\npersonal  liability.  Not  surprisingly, then, qualified immunity\n\nconfers  immunity only  from  individual-capacity suits,  such as\n\nsuits  for   money  damages,  that  have   been  brought  against\n\ngovernment actors.   Here,  Nereida  sued  the   defendants  both\n\nindividually  and  in  their official  capacities.    As  we have\n\nexplained,   the  doctrine   of  qualified   immunity  sets   the\n\nindividual-capacity claims to  rest.  But, the  official-capacity\n\nclaims  are qualitatively  different:   when a  plaintiff sues  a\n\nstate official  in the latter's official capacity,  as opposed to\n                                        \n\nthe  latter's  personal capacity,  the  underlying rationale  for\n                       \n\nqualified immunity has no bite.\n\n          An  official  capacity  suit  is, in  reality,  a  suit\n\nagainst  the governmental  entity, not  against the  governmental\n\n                    \n\n     3Appellant has not asserted  that her claim for compensatory\ndamages should  proceed against the defendants  in their official\ncapacities, and we do  not consider, therefore, whether sovereign\nimmunity would bar the  maintenance of such an action  in federal\ncourt.\n\n                                9\n\nactor.   See  Kentucky v.  Graham, 473  U.S. 159,  165-66 (1985);\n                                 \n\nBrandon v. Holt, 469  U.S. 464, 471-72 (1985); Monell v.

Consequently,  when a  plaintiff seeks  equitable relief\n\nfrom a  defendant in  his capacity  as an  officer of  the state,\n\nqualified immunity  is not a viable defense.   See, e.g., Wood v.\n                                                              \n\nStrickland, 420 U.S. 308, 314 n.6 (1975) (stating that  \"immunity\n          \n\nfrom   damages  does  not   ordinarily  bar  equitable  relief\");\n\nRodriguez-Pinto,  982 F.2d  at  38-40 (vacating  summary judgment\n               \n\nwith  respect  to claims  for  equitable redress  notwithstanding\n\ndefendants' qualified immunity).  So  it is here.  To the  extent\n\nthat  appellant,  on  First Amendment  grounds,  seeks  equitable\n\nrelief such as reinstatement in her  former position, the defense\n\nof qualified immunity does not obtain.\n\n          Absent the interposition of qualified immunity, we must\n\nlook  to what  rights  we  now believe  the  law  conferred on  a\n\ngovernment worker  at the  time in  question, rather  than merely\n\nseeking to ascertain what rights were clearly established at that\n\ntime.  See  Rodriguez-Pinto, 982 F.2d  at 38-40.   We begin  this\n                           \n\nprobe by  gauging the  respective gravitational pulls  exerted by\n\nAgosto-De-Feliciano and Rutan as they palpitate in this case.  \n                             \n\n          In  Agosto-De-Feliciano, we  determined that  the First\n                                 \n\nAmendment's proscription of patronage dismissals as formulated by\n\n                                10\n\nthe Court  in Elrod v.

We coupled  this substantive standard\n\nwith a  procedural requirement  that the plaintiff  establish the\n\nchange  in conditions \"by clear and convincing evidence.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n1220.\n\n          Shortly  after  we  decided   Agosto-De-Feliciano,  the\n                                                           \n\nSupreme  Court cast further illumination on the issue.  In Rutan,\n                                                                \n\n110  S.

It is an\n\ninteresting  question whether some vestige of Agosto-De-Feliciano\n                                                                 \n\nsurvives  Rutan, thereby providing a  sort of halfway  house   an\n               \n\nintermediate  First  Amendment  haven  for  employees wounded  by\n\nslings and arrows less damaging than those described by the Rutan\n                                                                 \n\nCourt.   But if there are  cases that elude Rutan  yet still come\n                                                 \n\nwithin  Agosto-De-Feliciano's reach   a matter  which we need not\n                             \n\ndecide   instances of actual demotion are  not among them.  While\n\nRutan's precise contours may arguably be indistinct,  it is clear\n     \n\nthat Rutan's doctrinal influence  suffuses situations in which an\n          \n\nemployee has actually been demoted.\n\n          Under  Rutan, then,  a plaintiff  who  has held  a non-\n                      \n\n                                11\n\npolicymaking job  in the  public sector may  ordinarily forestall\n\nsummary  judgment by pointing to evidence in the record which, if\n\ncredited,  would permit a rational factfinder  to conclude that a\n\ndemotion occurred and  that it stemmed  from a politically  based\n\ndiscriminatory animus.  Nereida passes this test.\n\n          There  can be  no  disputing that  the record  contains\n\nevidence sufficient to justify a trier in finding that a demotion\n\noccurred. Under the NPP-led regime, appellant occupied a position\n\nwith supervisory and coordinating functions.  When the new regime\n\nsettled  in, she  was shifted  to a  less lustrous position  in a\n\nlower  pay  bracket.   Her affidavit  also  relates that  she was\n\neffectively deprived of raises and similar due-course increments,\n\ndivested of supervisory powers,  and assigned \"only nominal tasks\n\n. .  . of a clerical  nature.\"  These facts,  if proven, together\n\nwith defendants' contemporaneous characterization of her transfer\n\nas  a  step  down, would  unquestionably  permit  a finding  that\n\nappellant was, in fact, demoted.\n\n          Appellant has  likewise adduced sufficient  evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory  animus.     According  to   her  affidavit,   the\n\ndefendants  told her  outright  that she  would  \"be demoted  and\n\nassigned  to  another  position without  any  responsibilities or\n\nduties\"  because of her NPP affiliation.  This direct evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory animus, although denied by defendants, is adequate\n\nto ward off summary judgment on the point.  Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 801\n                                               \n\n(d)(2)(A)  (statements  of  party-opponent  made  in   either  an\n\nindividual  or  a  representative  capacity  are  not  considered\n\n                                12\n\nhearsay).    In  this  case,  moreover,  the  direct  evidence is\n\nbuttressed by other facts of record from which a factfinder could\n\nreasonably  conclude that:  (1)  appellant was a  known member of\n\nthe  NPP; (2)  she was  transferred on the  premise of  what some\n\nevidence indicates was a sham reorganization; and (3) a number of\n\nother  personnel actions  allegedly  occurred at  about the  same\n\ntime, all of which  involved insinuating PDP members  into career\n\npositions previously  held  by NPP  members.   On  this  scumbled\n\nrecord, a reasonable factfinder,  drawing inferences favorable to\n\nappellant  and  making credibility  determinations in  her favor,\n\ncould  easily   conclude  that   the  defendants  acted   out  of\n\ndiscriminatory animus.4\n\n          Because  our  canvass of  the  record reveals  evidence\n\nwhich,  if credited,  would  warrant a  reasonable factfinder  in\n\nconcluding  that appellant  was  entitled  to reinstatement  and,\n\nperhaps, other  equitable redress,5 the district  court swept too\n\nbroadly in entering summary judgment across the board.\n\n                    \n\n     4To be sure, even  if a plaintiff adduces evidence  that her\njob  loss  was  politically  motivated, her  employer  may  still\nprevail by demonstrating that the employee would have been ousted\nanyway,  say,  for  unsatisfactory   work  performance  or  as  a\nlegitimate  casualty  of a  bona  fide reorganization.    See Mt.\n                                                                 \nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of  Educ. v.

But, since\n          \nthe record before us reflects  genuine questions of material fact\nas to why Nereida was demoted, the  defendants' explanations must\nbe tested in the crucible of a trial.\n\n     5Given the myriad factual uncertainties that dot the record,\nwe leave to the court below three related questions:  (1) whether\na  job still exists into which appellant might be reinstated, (2)\nwhether appellant can collect back pay, and (3) if so, the amount\nthereof.\n\n                                13\n\n                                D\n                                 \n\n                           Due Process\n                                      \n\n          Appellant also assigns error  anent the handling of her\n\ndue  process claim   a  claim which was  presumably foreclosed by\n\nthe entry of  summary judgment  but which the  court below  never\n\nspecifically mentioned  in its opinion.   Pressing an  analogy to\n\nRodriguez-Pinto,  982  F.2d  at   41,  defendants  suggest   that\n               \n\nappellant  waived   this  argument  by  failing   to  advance  it\n\nstraightforwardly  in the district court.  We find that the claim\n\nwas  adequately  preserved and,  therefore,  direct  the district\n\ncourt to consider it on remand.\n\n          While we could, of  course, search to ascertain whether\n\nsummary  judgment  might  be  affirmable  \"on  any  independently\n\nsufficient ground made manifest by  the record,\" One Parcel,  960\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at 204,  we see  no  reason to  decide an  issue which  the\n\ndistrict court  appears to  have overlooked, especially  since we\n\nmust  remand the case for further consideration of another claim.\n\nSee  supra Part  II(C).   Accordingly,  we  vacate the  entry  of\n          \n\nsummary judgment  as it pertains  to the  due process claim.

By 1984,  she occupied  a career  position in  the State\n\nInsurance  Fund (SIF), a government agency.1  In November of that\n\nyear, the incumbent NPP  governor lost the gubernatorial election\n\nto a member of the rival Popular Democratic Party (PDP).   Hot on\n\nthe  heels of the change in command two PDP loyalists, defendants\n\nCirilo  Tirado-Delgado   (Tirado)  and  Rafael   Rivera  Gonzalez\n\n(Rivera),  received  high-level  SIF  appointments     Tirado  as\n\nAdministrator of the SIF, Rivera as Director of Personnel.\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant  served as executive  assistant to SIF's Director\nof  Administrative Services.  The defendants  did not urge below,\nand have not  contended on appeal, that political  affiliation is\nan appropriate criterion for this position.\n\n                                3\n\n          Once ensconced at the  agency, the defendants allegedly\n\ninformed  appellant that  she  would be  demoted  because of  her\n\npolitical affiliation.  The  prophecy soon became a reality.   By\n\nletter dated  June 20,  1985, Rivera  advised appellant that  her\n\nposition  was   being  eliminated  as  part   of  a  departmental\n\nreorganization  and that, consequently, she was being transferred\n\nto a different SIF position  as assistant to the Director  of the\n\nSystems and Procedures Office.  Rivera's letter acknowledged that\n\n\"[t]his transfer represents a demotion.\"\n\n          Although  the  defendants now  struggle to  portray the\n\nreassignment as a lateral transfer, the record bears out Rivera's\n\ninitial characterization  of  the  move.   The  base  salary  for\n\nappellant's  new  position ($1565  per  month) was  significantly\n\nlower than the  base salary  for her former  position ($1915  per\n\nmonth).  The terms of her employment provided that, until the gap\n\nwas closed, she would continue to be paid at her accustomed rate,\n\nbut the difference between her new base salary and her actual pay\n\nwould  absorb any raises or bonuses she otherwise would have been\n\neligible to collect.  Thus, while appellant's pay was not reduced\n\noutright,  it was effectively frozen and her ability to earn more\n\nmoney was  circumscribed.  This  situation lasted at  least until\n\nFebruary 3, 1987,  when Tirado informed appellant by letter that,\n\nin terms of salary and classification, her new position was being\n\nupgraded to the level of her previous position.\n\n          The demotion  damaged appellant's pride as  well as her\n\npocketbook.   Her  new job,  unlike her old  one, did  not entail\n\n                                4\n\nsupervisory  responsibilities.   What  is more,  even the  modest\n\nfunctions  and duties  corresponding to  the new  job title  were\n\nplaced beyond her reach as she was asked to perform only clerical\n\ntasks.   As a final  indignity, although the defendants abolished\n\nappellant's  former position  on  paper, its  functions  remained\n\nessentially intact and were performed by an employee with ties to\n\nthe PDP.\n\n          Asserting that she had been  constructively discharged,\n\nor,  alternatively,  demoted because  of  her  exercise of  First\n\nAmendment  rights,  and  contending  that the  adverse  personnel\n\nactions  undertaken  at  defendants'  direction  deprived her  of\n\nproperty without due process of law, appellant brought suit under\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983  (1988).  She sought  both equitable relief  and\n\nmoney  damages.  The district court gave her cold gruel, entering\n\nsummary judgment in defendants' favor on all claims.  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n                                A\n                                 \n\n                         Summary Judgment\n                                         \n\n          Summary judgment exists to  \"pierce the boilerplate  of\n\nthe  pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine\n\nwhether trial is actually  required.\"  Wynne v.

See, e.g., Wood v.\n                                                              \n\nStrickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109199\"><a href=\"/opinion/109199/wood-v-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 n.6 (1975) (stating that  \"immunity\n          \n\nfrom   damages  does  not   ordinarily  bar  equitable  relief\");\n\nRodriguez-Pinto,  982 F.2d  at  38-40 (vacating  summary judgment\n               \n\nwith  respect  to claims  for  equitable redress  notwithstanding\n\ndefendants' qualified immunity).  So  it is here.  To the  extent\n\nthat  appellant,  on  First Amendment  grounds,  seeks  equitable\n\nrelief such as reinstatement in her  former position, the defense\n\nof qualified immunity does not obtain.\n\n          Absent the interposition of qualified immunity, we must\n\nlook  to what  rights  we  now believe  the  law  conferred on  a\n\ngovernment worker  at the  time in  question, rather  than merely\n\nseeking to ascertain what rights were clearly established at that\n\ntime.  See  Rodriguez-Pinto, 982 F.2d  at 38-40.   We begin  this\n                           \n\nprobe by  gauging the  respective gravitational pulls  exerted by\n\nAgosto-De-Feliciano and Rutan as they palpitate in this case.  \n                             \n\n          In  Agosto-De-Feliciano, we  determined that  the First\n                                 \n\nAmendment's proscription of patronage dismissals as formulated by\n\n                                10\n\nthe Court  in Elrod v.

Agosto-De-Feliciano,  889  F.2d  at  1218  (internal\n                                \n\nquotation marks  omitted).  We coupled  this substantive standard\n\nwith a  procedural requirement  that the plaintiff  establish the\n\nchange  in conditions \"by clear and convincing evidence.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n1220.\n\n          Shortly  after  we  decided   Agosto-De-Feliciano,  the\n                                                           \n\nSupreme  Court cast further illumination on the issue.  In Rutan,\n                                                                \n\n110  S.

It is an\n\ninteresting  question whether some vestige of Agosto-De-Feliciano\n                                                                 \n\nsurvives  Rutan, thereby providing a  sort of halfway  house   an\n               \n\nintermediate  First  Amendment  haven  for  employees wounded  by\n\nslings and arrows less damaging than those described by the Rutan\n                                                                 \n\nCourt.   But if there are  cases that elude Rutan  yet still come\n                                                 \n\nwithin  Agosto-De-Feliciano's reach   a matter  which we need not\n                             \n\ndecide   instances of actual demotion are  not among them.  While\n\nRutan's precise contours may arguably be indistinct,  it is clear\n     \n\nthat Rutan's doctrinal influence  suffuses situations in which an\n          \n\nemployee has actually been demoted.\n\n          Under  Rutan, then,  a plaintiff  who  has held  a non-\n                      \n\n                                11\n\npolicymaking job  in the  public sector may  ordinarily forestall\n\nsummary  judgment by pointing to evidence in the record which, if\n\ncredited,  would permit a rational factfinder  to conclude that a\n\ndemotion occurred and  that it stemmed  from a politically  based\n\ndiscriminatory animus.  Nereida passes this test.\n\n          There  can be  no  disputing that  the record  contains\n\nevidence sufficient to justify a trier in finding that a demotion\n\noccurred. Under the NPP-led regime, appellant occupied a position\n\nwith supervisory and coordinating functions.  When the new regime\n\nsettled  in, she  was shifted  to a  less lustrous position  in a\n\nlower  pay  bracket.   Her affidavit  also  relates that  she was\n\neffectively deprived of raises and similar due-course increments,\n\ndivested of supervisory powers,  and assigned \"only nominal tasks\n\n. .  . of a clerical  nature.\"  These facts,  if proven, together\n\nwith defendants' contemporaneous characterization of her transfer\n\nas  a  step  down, would  unquestionably  permit  a finding  that\n\nappellant was, in fact, demoted.\n\n          Appellant has  likewise adduced sufficient  evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory  animus.     According  to   her  affidavit,   the\n\ndefendants  told her  outright  that she  would  \"be demoted  and\n\nassigned  to  another  position without  any  responsibilities or\n\nduties\"  because of her NPP affiliation.  This direct evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory animus, although denied by defendants, is adequate\n\nto ward off summary judgment on the point.  Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 801\n                                               \n\n(d)(2)(A)  (statements  of  party-opponent  made  in   either  an\n\nindividual  or  a  representative  capacity  are  not  considered\n\n                                12\n\nhearsay).    In  this  case,  moreover,  the  direct  evidence is\n\nbuttressed by other facts of record from which a factfinder could\n\nreasonably  conclude that:  (1)  appellant was a  known member of\n\nthe  NPP; (2)  she was  transferred on the  premise of  what some\n\nevidence indicates was a sham reorganization; and (3) a number of\n\nother  personnel actions  allegedly  occurred at  about the  same\n\ntime, all of which  involved insinuating PDP members  into career\n\npositions previously  held  by NPP  members.   On  this  scumbled\n\nrecord, a reasonable factfinder,  drawing inferences favorable to\n\nappellant  and  making credibility  determinations in  her favor,\n\ncould  easily   conclude  that   the  defendants  acted   out  of\n\ndiscriminatory animus.4\n\n          Because  our  canvass of  the  record reveals  evidence\n\nwhich,  if credited,  would  warrant a  reasonable factfinder  in\n\nconcluding  that appellant  was  entitled  to reinstatement  and,\n\nperhaps, other  equitable redress,5 the district  court swept too\n\nbroadly in entering summary judgment across the board.\n\n                    \n\n     4To be sure, even  if a plaintiff adduces evidence  that her\njob  loss  was  politically  motivated, her  employer  may  still\nprevail by demonstrating that the employee would have been ousted\nanyway,  say,  for  unsatisfactory   work  performance  or  as  a\nlegitimate  casualty  of a  bona  fide reorganization.

But, since\n          \nthe record before us reflects  genuine questions of material fact\nas to why Nereida was demoted, the  defendants' explanations must\nbe tested in the crucible of a trial.\n\n     5Given the myriad factual uncertainties that dot the record,\nwe leave to the court below three related questions:  (1) whether\na  job still exists into which appellant might be reinstated, (2)\nwhether appellant can collect back pay, and (3) if so, the amount\nthereof.\n\n                                13\n\n                                D\n                                 \n\n                           Due Process\n                                      \n\n          Appellant also assigns error  anent the handling of her\n\ndue  process claim   a  claim which was  presumably foreclosed by\n\nthe entry of  summary judgment  but which the  court below  never\n\nspecifically mentioned  in its opinion.   Pressing an  analogy to\n\nRodriguez-Pinto,  982  F.2d  at   41,  defendants  suggest   that\n               \n\nappellant  waived   this  argument  by  failing   to  advance  it\n\nstraightforwardly  in the district court.  We find that the claim\n\nwas  adequately  preserved and,  therefore,  direct  the district\n\ncourt to consider it on remand.\n\n          While we could, of  course, search to ascertain whether\n\nsummary  judgment  might  be  affirmable  \"on  any  independently\n\nsufficient ground made manifest by  the record,\" One Parcel,  960\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at 204,  we see  no  reason to  decide an  issue which  the\n\ndistrict court  appears to  have overlooked, especially  since we\n\nmust  remand the case for further consideration of another claim.\n\nSee  supra Part  II(C).   Accordingly,  we  vacate the  entry  of\n          \n\nsummary judgment  as it pertains  to the  due process claim.   We\n\nintimate  no opinion as to the ultimate resolution of this aspect\n\nof the case.\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We  need  go no  further.   For  the reasons  stated we\n\naffirm  the  district  court's   entry  of  summary  judgment  on\n\nappellant's  constructive  discharge  claim  and  on  her   First\n\n                                14\n\nAmendment  claims  against  the defendants  in  their  individual\n\ncapacities;  we reverse  the  district court's  entry of  summary\n\njudgment  on  appellant's  First  Amendment claim  for  equitable\n\nredress against the defendants  in their official capacities; and\n\nwe vacate the order  for summary judgment insofar as  it purports\n\nto  foreclose  appellant  from  further prosecution  of  her  due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n          Affirmed in  part, reversed  in part, and  remanded for\n                                                                 \n\nfurther  proceedings  consistent herewith.
