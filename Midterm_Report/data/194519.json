Appellant Ralph  J. Miller,\n                                   \n\nappeals  from a  summary judgment  in an  action under  39 U.S.C.\n\n  1208(b)  (1980)1  for breach  of  contract  against the  United\n\nStates Postal Service  (\"Postal Service\"), and for breach of duty\n\nof  fair   representation  against  the   National  Rural  Letter\n\nCarrier's  Association  (the  \"Union\").    This  joint  cause  is\n\ncommonly referred  to as  a \"hybrid\"  suit.  See,  e.g., Reed  v.\n                                                             \n\nUnited Transp.  Union, 488 U.S. 319,  327 (1989).  We  affirm the\n                     \n\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n          Appellant, a rural carrier, lost his job at the  Postal\n\nService  on  May  21,  1986.    As a  member  of  the  collective\n\nbargaining  unit,  he  filed  a grievance  under  the  collective\n\nbargaining agreement  between the  Union and the  Postal Service.\n\nThe  matter culminated  in arbitration,  in which  the arbitrator\n\nfound that the Postal Service fired appellant without just cause,\n\nand ordered  reinstatement and lost earnings.   Approximately one\n\nmonth after this ruling,  the Postal Service reinstated appellant\n\n                    \n\n1  Section 1208(b) provides:\n\n            Suits for violation of  contracts between\n            the   Postal   Service   and    a   labor\n            organization representing  Postal Service\n            employees,  or  between  any  such  labor\n            organization,  may  be  brought   in  any\n            district  court  of  the   United  States\n            having   jurisdiction  of   the  parties,\n            without   respect   to   the  amount   in\n            controversy.\n\nBecause this language  is identical in  all relevant respects  to\nthat of   301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 24 U.S.C.\n  185(a) (West  Supp. 1992), cases interpreting  the latter apply\nto   1208(b).  Bowen v. United States Postal Serv., 459 U.S. 212,\n                                                  \n232 n.2 (1983) (White,  J., concurring in part and  dissenting in\npart).\n\nbut  refused to afford  him back pay.   The Postal  service based\n\nthis  refusal  on appellant's  alleged  failure  to mitigate  his\n\ndamages  by  attempting to  obtain  other  employment during  the\n\nthirteen-month  period of  suspension as  required by  the Postal\n\nService's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (the \"Manual\").\n\n          Consequently,  appellant filed a new grievance for back\n\npay which  proceeded through the various  contractual steps until\n\nit reached national arbitration  on July 28, 1989.   In addition,\n\non  July  10, 1990,  appellant filed  the  present action  in the\n\nUnited States  District Court for the District  of New Hampshire.\n\nThe Union subsequently withdrew the grievance from arbitration.\n\n          Appellant  initially proceeded  pro  se in  his federal\n                                                 \n\ncourt  action against  the  Postal Service  and  the Union.2    A\n\nseries   of   amendments   followed   his   original   complaint.\n\nEssentially, he alleged that:   (1) the Postal Service  failed to\n\nabide  by  the arbitration  award,  and  the Manual's  mitigation\n\nrequirements  conflict  with  the  provisions of  the  collective\n\nbargaining agreement; and (2) the  Union was \"either unwilling or\n\nunable to recover [his] money.\"  \n\n          The  Postal Service counterattacked with its own motion\n\nfor  summary  judgment,  which  the  Union  joined.   The  motion\n\nasserted   that:     (1)  the   collective  bargaining   contract\n\nincorporated the Manual by reference;  (2) the Manual required  a\n\n                    \n\n2    Although in  one  of  the  motions  to amend  his  complaint\nappellant  stated that his  \"only dispute  . .  . [was]  with his\nemployer,\" he later filed a motion for summary  judgment accusing\nthe Union of breaching its duty of fair representation by failing\nto \"follow up on a lead\" that he provided.\n\n                               -3-\n\nsuspended  employee to  mitigate  damages  by seeking  employment\n\nduring  suspension  or discharge;  and  (3)  appellant failed  to\n\nmitigate his damages.  Additionally, the Union asserted  that its\n\ndecision to withdraw appellant's grievance for back pay \"was made\n\nfor rational, nondiscriminatory reasons.\"\n\n          Appellant,  by   this  time  represented   by  counsel,\n\nretorted  that the Postal Service was \"not entitled to a judgment\n\nas  a matter  of law  because the  defense now  asserted was  not\n\nraised  in the  underlying  arbitration.\"   With  respect to  the\n\nUnion, appellant maintained that  it had treated his claim  \"in a\n\nperfunctory  manner\"  and that  this  conduct,  coupled with  the\n\nthree-year delay  during which it  failed to inform  appellant of\n\nalternate  modes of relief, amounted  to a breach  of the Union's\n\nduty of fair representation when it withdrew the grievance.\n\n          The district  court's summary  judgment for  the Postal\n\nService  is  narrowly tailored  and  deserves our  approval.   To\n\nsucceed  in a hybrid  breach of contract  and fair representation\n\nclaim,  appellant  must  establish  not only  that  the  employer\n\nbreached  the contract, but also that his union breached its duty\n                                \n\nof  fair representation.

See  DelCostello v.  Teamsters, 462  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n151, 164-65 (1983).\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The district  court found  no violation of  the Union's\n\nduty toward appellant, and  we agree.  A Union breaches this duty\n\n\"only when  [its]  conduct  toward  a member  of  the  collective\n\nbargaining unit  is arbitrary, discriminatory, or  in bad faith.\"\n\nVaca v. Sipes,  386 U.S.  171, 190 (1967);  Williams v.  Sea-Land\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.,  844 F.2d  17,  19 (1st  Cir.  1988).   The Supreme  Court\n     \n\nexplained  that a  union's actions  are arbitrary   \"only  if, in\n\nlight  of the  factual and  legal landscape  at the  time of  the\n\nunion's actions, the union's  behavior is so far outside  a 'wide\n\nrange of reasonableness' as  to be irrational.\"  Air  Line Pilots\n                                                                 \n\nAss'n Int'l v. O'Neill,  111 S. Ct. 1127, 1130  (1991) (citations\n                      \n\nomitted).  Courts may not substitute their own views for those of\n\nthe  union.     \"[A]ny  substantial  examination   of  a  union's\n\nperformance  . . .  must be  highly deferential,\"   id.  at 1135,\n                                                       \n\nbecause  of  the  well-recognized  need  to  allow  unions  ample\n\nlatitude in the performance of their  representative duties.  See\n                                                                 \n\nSteelworkers  v.

Thus, we have  held that a union's mere negligence or\n\nerroneous  judgment will not constitute  a breach of  the duty of\n\nfair representation.   Condon v. United  Steelworkers Local 2944,\n                                                                \n\n683 F.2d 590, 594 (1st Cir. 1982).  We also allow the union great\n\nlatitude in determining the merits of an employee's grievance and\n\nthe level of effort it will expend to pursue it.

See\n                                                                 \n\nCol n-V lez v. Puerto Rico Marine Management, Inc., 957 F.2d 933,\n                                                  \n\n941  (1st Cir. 1992); see  also Vaca, 386  U.S. at 191 (employees\n                                    \n\nhave no absolute right to have grievance taken to arbitration).\n\n          The undisputed facts establish that the Union initially\n\nsupported appellant's grievance regarding his back-pay claim.  It\n\nprocessed the grievance through  the various contractual steps up\n\nto national arbitration.  Although  the Union knew of appellant's\n\nfailure to  mitigate, the  Union  believed that  a genuine  issue\n\nexisted  regarding  whether  the  mitigation   requirements  were\n\n\"punitive, unreasonable and in  conflict with other provisions of\n\nthe  National   Agreement.\"    It  thus   sought  arbitration  of\n\nappellant's  claim and continued to investigate the matter.  As a\n\nresult of  this investigation, the Union  discovered that several\n\narbitrators    had    found   mitigation    requirements   valid.\n\nAccordingly,  it decided that it was in everyone's best interests\n\nto withdraw  the grievance from  arbitration.3  Before  doing so,\n\nhowever, it attempted, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a  settlement\n\nwith the Postal Service.  On November 8, 1990, the Union withdrew\n\nthe grievance.\n\n          Given these  undisputed facts, we cannot  conclude that\n\nthe Union's actions were irrational.  Furthermore, nothing in the\n\n                    \n\n3    To  continue a  meritless  grievance  adversely affects  the\nUnion's  credibility and finances.  See Williams, 844 F.2d at 21;\n                                                \nBerrigan  v. Greyhound Lines, Inc.,  782 F.2d 295,  298 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n1986).\n\n                               -6-\n\nrecord  intimates  that  the  Union  acted  in  a  perfunctory or\n\narbitrary  manner or  in  bad faith.    If anything,  the  record\n\nexhibits diligence  and  an attempt  to make  the best  out of  a\n\ndifficult situation.   If the  Union failed, it  was not  through\n\nlack  of  effort, but  rather  because  appellant's claim  lacked\n\nmerit.\n\n          Finally,  at oral argument appellant argued principally\n\nthat  the  Union violated  its  duty  of  fair representation  by\n\nfailing  to  properly  advise  him  of  the  Manual's  mitigation\n\nrequirements.   This  is  a new  argument,  never raised  in  the\n\ndistrict  court.   Appellant's  change in  direction  has been  a\n\nrecurrent theme throughout this litigation.  See, e.g., Miller v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States Postal Serv.,  792 F. Supp. 4, 6 n.4 (D.N.H. 1992).\n                          \n\nIf the  argument  was mistakenly  overlooked  during the  pro  se\n                                                                 \n\nstages  of  the  case,  appellant  had  ample  opportunity,  once\n\nrepresented by counsel, to correct any  earlier deficiencies.  It\n\nis now  too late to do  so; we cannot consider  issues raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal.   G.D. v. Westmoreland Sch.  Dist., 930\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  942, 950 (1st Cir.  1991); Johnston v.

The failure to  adequately notify its  members of their\nburden under the Collective  Bargaining Agreement does not amount\nto  more  than  negligence.   Mere  negligence  or  a mistake  in\njudgment is  insufficient to establish  a breach  of the  union's\nduty.\"  Jenkins  v.

We  affirm the\n                     \n\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n          Appellant, a rural carrier, lost his job at the  Postal\n\nService  on  May  21,  1986.    As a  member  of  the  collective\n\nbargaining  unit,  he  filed  a grievance  under  the  collective\n\nbargaining agreement  between the  Union and the  Postal Service.\n\nThe  matter culminated  in arbitration,  in which  the arbitrator\n\nfound that the Postal Service fired appellant without just cause,\n\nand ordered  reinstatement and lost earnings.   Approximately one\n\nmonth after this ruling,  the Postal Service reinstated appellant\n\n                    \n\n1  Section 1208(b) provides:\n\n            Suits for violation of  contracts between\n            the   Postal   Service   and    a   labor\n            organization representing  Postal Service\n            employees,  or  between  any  such  labor\n            organization,  may  be  brought   in  any\n            district  court  of  the   United  States\n            having   jurisdiction  of   the  parties,\n            without   respect   to   the  amount   in\n            controversy.\n\nBecause this language  is identical in  all relevant respects  to\nthat of   301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 24 U.S.C.\n  185(a) (West  Supp. 1992), cases interpreting  the latter apply\nto   1208(b).

United States Postal Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110820\"><a href=\"/opinion/110820/bowen-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                  \n232 n.2 (1983) (White,  J., concurring in part and  dissenting in\npart).\n\nbut  refused to afford  him back pay.   The Postal  service based\n\nthis  refusal  on appellant's  alleged  failure  to mitigate  his\n\ndamages  by  attempting to  obtain  other  employment during  the\n\nthirteen-month  period of  suspension as  required by  the Postal\n\nService's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (the \"Manual\").\n\n          Consequently,  appellant filed a new grievance for back\n\npay which  proceeded through the various  contractual steps until\n\nit reached national arbitration  on July 28, 1989.   In addition,\n\non  July  10, 1990,  appellant filed  the  present action  in the\n\nUnited States  District Court for the District  of New Hampshire.\n\nThe Union subsequently withdrew the grievance from arbitration.\n\n          Appellant  initially proceeded  pro  se in  his federal\n                                                 \n\ncourt  action against  the  Postal Service  and  the Union.2    A\n\nseries   of   amendments   followed   his   original   complaint.\n\nEssentially, he alleged that:   (1) the Postal Service  failed to\n\nabide  by  the arbitration  award,  and  the Manual's  mitigation\n\nrequirements  conflict  with  the  provisions of  the  collective\n\nbargaining agreement; and (2) the  Union was \"either unwilling or\n\nunable to recover [his] money.\"  \n\n          The  Postal Service counterattacked with its own motion\n\nfor  summary  judgment,  which  the  Union  joined.   The  motion\n\nasserted   that:     (1)  the   collective  bargaining   contract\n\nincorporated the Manual by reference;  (2) the Manual required  a\n\n                    \n\n2    Although in  one  of  the  motions  to amend  his  complaint\nappellant  stated that his  \"only dispute  . .  . [was]  with his\nemployer,\" he later filed a motion for summary  judgment accusing\nthe Union of breaching its duty of fair representation by failing\nto \"follow up on a lead\" that he provided.\n\n                               -3-\n\nsuspended  employee to  mitigate  damages  by seeking  employment\n\nduring  suspension  or discharge;  and  (3)  appellant failed  to\n\nmitigate his damages.  Additionally, the Union asserted  that its\n\ndecision to withdraw appellant's grievance for back pay \"was made\n\nfor rational, nondiscriminatory reasons.\"\n\n          Appellant,  by   this  time  represented   by  counsel,\n\nretorted  that the Postal Service was \"not entitled to a judgment\n\nas  a matter  of law  because the  defense now  asserted was  not\n\nraised  in the  underlying  arbitration.\"   With  respect to  the\n\nUnion, appellant maintained that  it had treated his claim  \"in a\n\nperfunctory  manner\"  and that  this  conduct,  coupled with  the\n\nthree-year delay  during which it  failed to inform  appellant of\n\nalternate  modes of relief, amounted  to a breach  of the Union's\n\nduty of fair representation when it withdrew the grievance.\n\n          The district  court's summary  judgment for  the Postal\n\nService  is  narrowly tailored  and  deserves our  approval.   To\n\nsucceed  in a hybrid  breach of contract  and fair representation\n\nclaim,  appellant  must  establish  not only  that  the  employer\n\nbreached  the contract, but also that his union breached its duty\n                                \n\nof  fair representation.

It\n\nprocessed the grievance through  the various contractual steps up\n\nto national arbitration.  Although  the Union knew of appellant's\n\nfailure to  mitigate, the  Union  believed that  a genuine  issue\n\nexisted  regarding  whether  the  mitigation   requirements  were\n\n\"punitive, unreasonable and in  conflict with other provisions of\n\nthe  National   Agreement.\"    It  thus   sought  arbitration  of\n\nappellant's  claim and continued to investigate the matter.  As a\n\nresult of  this investigation, the Union  discovered that several\n\narbitrators    had    found   mitigation    requirements   valid.\n\nAccordingly,  it decided that it was in everyone's best interests\n\nto withdraw  the grievance from  arbitration.3  Before  doing so,\n\nhowever, it attempted, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a  settlement\n\nwith the Postal Service.  On November 8, 1990, the Union withdrew\n\nthe grievance.\n\n          Given these  undisputed facts, we cannot  conclude that\n\nthe Union's actions were irrational.  Furthermore, nothing in the\n\n                    \n\n3    To  continue a  meritless  grievance  adversely affects  the\nUnion's  credibility and finances.
