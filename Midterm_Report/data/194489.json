Holmes  Fund (\"Holmes  Trust\"), and\n\nDorothy  Holmes, as  trustee  of the  Holmes Trust  (hereinafter,\n\ncollectively, \"Holmes  parties\"), appeal  a district  court order\n\ndirecting  the  disbursement of  an  escrow  fund established  to\n\ndefray certain civil liabilities relating to their sale of Holmes\n\nTransportation, Inc.  (\"HTI\"), a corporation wholly  owned by the\n\nHolmes  parties.  The  Holmes parties are joined  on appeal by J.\n\nRobert  Seder,  Esquire,  a  former escrow  agent  for  the fund.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction  having been retained, and certain prelim-\n\ninary matters having been  resolved on remand, we proceed  to the\n\nmerits and affirm the district court order.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          First  we  describe the  somewhat intricate  context in\n\nwhich  the  present litigation  developed.    The Holmes  parties\n\nentered  into negotiations  in  1988 to  sell  HTI to  Route  USA\n\nResources,  Inc. (\"Route  USA\"), a  corporation wholly  owned and\n\ncontrolled  by  Manfred  Ruhland.   Throughout  the negotiations,\n\nSeder represented  the Holmes  parties, and Robert  D. Gunderman,\n\nEsquire, represented Ruhland and Route USA.   Ruhland had assumed\n\ncontrol of HTI, and consummation of  the sale of HTI to Route USA\n\nappeared   imminent,  when  the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission\n\n(\"ICC\")  initiated the  present  action against  HTI on  July 13,\n\n                                3\n\n1988, to recover $501,976 in refunds allegedly due HTI  customers\n\nfor freight  overpayments improperly  withheld by HTI  during the\n\nperiod 1984-1988 (\"ICC refunds\").1\n\n          The ICC action  threatened to derail  the HTI sale,  as\n\nRuhland demanded  a  reduction in  the purchase  price to  offset\n\nHTI's  contingent liability on the  ICC refund claims.   In order\n\nfor the  HTI sale to proceed, the Holmes parties agreed to escrow\n\n$500,000  of Ruhland's purchase  money deposit to  defray the ICC\n\nrefund claims against  HTI (the \"private escrow  agreement\").  On\n\nSeptember 22,  1988, Seder executed the  private escrow agreement\n\nas \"attorney in fact\" for the Holmes parties; Ruhland executed it\n\nin behalf of Route USA; Seder and Gunderman executed it as desig-\n\nnated escrow agents under the private escrow agreement.  With the\n\nICC refunds obstacle apparently  resolved, Ruhland abandoned  the\n\ndemand  for a reduction in the HTI purchase price, and the Holmes\n\nparties' sale of HTI's stock to Route USA was consummated without\n\nfurther incident.\n\n          While the private escrow agreement was  being negotiat-\n\ned,  HTI proposed  a settlement  of the  ICC refund  claims.   On\n\nDecember 12,  1988, HTI,  represented by Gunderman,  consented to\n\nthe entry  of a district  court injunctive  decree (\"consent  de-\n\ncree\") mandating, in pertinent part, that HTI establish an escrow\n\nfund  containing at least  $502,000 with  which all  HTI customer\n\n                    \n\n     1The ICC complaint did not name the Holmes parties as defen-\ndants,  but alleged that HTI  failed to process  and refund 3,048\nunidentified payments and 3,485 duplicate payments received  from\nshippers, in violation of 49 C.F.R.    1008.9(a) and 1008.9(b).\n\n                                4\n\noverpayments  were  to be  refunded  by December 31,  1988.   For\n\nreasons which  remain unclear, neither  the ICC nor  the district\n\ncourt  had yet  been  apprised of  the  private escrow  agreement\n\npreviously  executed between  the Holmes  parties and  Route USA.\n\nThus,  the   escrow  account  arrangements   envisioned  in   the\n\nDecember 12 consent decree varied in considerable detail from the\n\nterms of the private escrow agreement  between the Holmes parties\n\nand  Route  USA.2   Their function  was  identical, however:   to\n\nestablish  and preserve  a  fund for  defraying  the ICC  refunds\n\ndetermined to  be due HTI's overcharged customers  in the present\n\naction.\n\n          The  Holmes parties  were  not parties  to the  present\n\naction  at  the time  the consent  decree  was entered.    At the\n\ninstance  of the ICC, however, the consent decree was executed by\n\nSeder, who  had represented the Holmes parties throughout the HTI\n\nnegotiations  with Ruhland and Route  USA.  As  Gunderman and HTI\n\n(but not the ICC) were well aware, of course, Seder and Gunderman\n\n                    \n\n     2The private escrow agreement  provided that (1) the refunds\nwere  to be made by HTI in  the first instance, and reimbursed by\nthe escrow  fund in $25,000 increments upon certification by HTI;\n(2) the escrowed funds were to remain the property of  the Holmes\nparties,  and, if not disbursed by March 16, 1989, were to revert\nto them;  (3) the escrowed funds  were to be used  only to defray\nobligations accruing prior to  February 3, 1988 (the date Ruhland\nassumed  operational control of HTI);  and (4) the escrow account\nwas to be deposited in a state-chartered financial institution.\n     The  consent decree, on  the other  hand, provided  that (1)\nrefund  payments were to be made directly from the escrow account\nto the overcharged shippers; (2) all refunds (whether originating\nbefore or after February 3, 1988) were to be made from the escrow\naccount;  (3) the escrow account  was not to  terminate until all\nrefunds  were made; and only then were any undistributed funds to\nrevert to HTI; and  (4) the escrow account was  to be established\nin a federally-chartered financial institution.\n\n                                5\n\nwere the designated escrow agents under the private escrow  fund.\n\nNo refunds were ever disbursed.\n\n          On July 14, 1989, Ruhland  sold HTI to Anthony Mataraz-\n\nzo.   Matarazzo was notified  of the ICC  action against HTI, but\n\nwas  informed by Gunderman that  the ICC refund  claims were \"al-\n\nready taken care of\" and that a $500,000 escrow  account had been\n\nset aside  to defray the refunds.   The Holmes  parties had other\n\nplans  for the  escrowed funds.   On  July 18,  1989, the  Holmes\n\nparties initiated a declaratory  judgment action in Massachusetts\n\nSuperior  Court, to  recoup the funds  deposited pursuant  to the\n\nprivate escrow agreement.   Meanwhile, the ICC  became aware that\n\nthe refunds  required  under  the  consent decree  had  not  been\n\ndisbursed.\n\n          On September 14,  1989, the  ICC convened a  meeting of\n\npersons  associated with HTI and  with the original  lawsuit.  At\n\nthe  meeting, the ICC was  informed of the  Holmes parties' state\n\ncourt lawsuit and was furnished for the first time with copies of\n\nthe  private escrow  agreement.   Matarazzo,  in  behalf of  HTI,\n\nagreed to effect the overdue ICC refunds within 30 days, provided\n\nSeder and Gunderman, as escrow agents, would release the escrowed\n\nfunds.   Gunderman agreed.   Seder declined,  however, contending\n\nthat (1) the Holmes parties' obligations under the private escrow\n\nagreement terminated on March 16, 1989, (2) Seder's signature had\n\nnot  bound the Holmes parties to the  consent decree, and (3) the\n\nHolmes parties were  therefore entitled to  recover the funds  in\n\nescrow.\n\n                                6\n\n          On  October 13,  1989,  the Holmes  parties  and  Seder\n\nintervened in  the present action, demanding  a judicial declara-\n\ntion entitling the Holmes parties  to the escrow funds.  The  ICC\n\ncountered with  a civil contempt citation  against Seder, Gunder-\n\nman,  Ruhland, Route USA, HTI, and Matarazzo.  The ICC contended,\n\ninter alia, that Seder  and Gunderman, by their execution  of the\n          \n\nconsent decree, subjected the  escrowed funds to the jurisdiction\n\nof  the district  court for  disposition  in accordance  with the\n\nterms  of the  consent decree.   The  ICC further  contended that\n\nGunderman and Seder, as escrow agents, failed to provide  prudent\n\nsupervision relating to HTI's obligation to disburse the escrowed\n\nfunds in  accordance with  the terms of  the consent  decree.   A\n\nbarrage  of cross-claims  and  counterclaims ensued.   On  Decem-\n\nber 15,  1989, HTI filed a  voluntary chapter 11  petition in the\n\nDistrict of New Jersey.\n\n          On January 26, 1990, after  an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court  issued its  findings of fact,  and concluded,  in\n\npertinent  part, that  (1)  the consent  decree  and the  private\n\nescrow  agreement were negotiated simultaneously as \"synergistic\"\n\ndocuments intended to  ensure funding of the  ICC refunds antici-\n\npated under  the  consent  decree;  (2) the  consent  decree  was\n\nexecuted by Seder  as attorney for  the Holmes  parties and as  a\n\ndesignated escrow  agent under the private  escrow agreement; and\n\n(3) the consent decree was \"the only operative document\" defining\n\nthe legal obligations  of Seder  and Gunderman  relating to  dis-\n\nbursements from the escrow fund.  The district court rejected the\n\n                                7\n\nHolmes parties' claims to the escrow fund, and held HTI and Seder\n\nin  civil  contempt for  refusing  to  disburse the  ICC  refunds\n\npursuant to  the  consent  decree.3   Seder  and  Gunderman  were\n\nreplaced as escrow agents  by Frank Weiner, an HTI  attorney, who\n\nwas directed to  disburse the ICC refunds by March 30,  1990.  We\n\nstayed disbursements pending appeal.\n\n          On April 1,  1992, following remand, see  ICC v. Holmes\n                                                                 \n\nTransp., Inc., 931 F.2d  984 (1st Cir. 1991), the  district court\n             \n\nvacated its  contempt finding  against Seder and  Gunderman,4 but\n\nreaffirmed its  order directing  disbursement of the  ICC refunds\n\nfrom the escrow fund in accordance with  the terms of the consent\n\ndecree.    Appellants  now  challenge the  district  court  order\n\nentered on remand.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     3Gunderman's civil contempt was deemed purged by his earlier\nagreement  to transfer the  escrow funds  in accordance  with the\nconsent decree.\n\n     4Since Seder's removal  as escrow agent  terminated whatever\ninterest  he asserted  as  a declaratory  judgment plaintiff,  we\nconclude that Seder lacks appellate standing.  See  United States\n                                                                 \nv. Little Joe  Trawlers, Inc., 780 F.2d 158, 161  (1st Cir. 1986)\n                             \n(\"[t]o have standing to appeal, an appellant ordinarily must have\nbeen a party to the proceeding below, and have  been aggrieved by\nthe order appealed from . . .  .

Accordingly,\nSeder's  appeal of  the original  contempt finding  (based, inter\n                                                                 \nalia, on the vagueness of the consent decree, see Fed.

Except as otherwise  indicated, therefore,\nwe refer to the Holmes parties as appellants.\n\n                                8\n\n          As they were not named in the consent decree or in  the\n\nunderlying ICC action, appellants contend that the district court\n\nlacked authority to subject  them and the private escrow  fund to\n\nthe terms of the consent decree.  We disagree.\n\n          The thrust of their argument is that the private escrow\n\nagreement  and  the district  court  consent decree  contemplated\n\nseparate  and unrelated funds from which the ICC refunds would be\n                       \n\ndisbursed:  a \"private escrow fund,\" established under the escrow\n\nagreement and belonging  to the Holmes parties,  which lay beyond\n\nthe  jurisdictional  reach of  the  district court;  and  an \"ICC\n\nfund,\" established  by the consent  decree, which was  within the\n\ncontrol of the court  but imposed legal obligations only  on HTI.\n                                                                \n\nTo the extent that the district court purportedly subjected their\n\nprivately-created fund to the  consent decree, the Holmes parties\n\ncontend that  it lacked jurisdiction and  disregarded the express\n\nterms of their private escrow agreement.   To the extent that the\n\nconsent  decree  directed  disbursements  from  the  escrow  fund\n\nidentified in the  consent decree, the Holmes  parties argue that\n\n   as nonparties to the underlying  action    they were not bound\n\nby the terms  of the consent decree.   See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 65(d)\n                                          \n\n(injunction  \"binding only upon the parties  to the action, their\n\nofficers, agents,  servants, employees,  and attorneys,  and upon\n\nthose  persons in active  concert or participation  with them who\n\nreceive  actual notice of the order by personal service or other-\n\nwise\"); G. &amp; C.

The determinative difficulty  with appellants'\n\nconclusion  lies in  its faulty  premise     that there  were two\n\nseparate and unrelated funds.\n\n          After  carefully  reviewing  the  relationship  of  the\n\nparties, as well as the circumstances surrounding the drafting of\n\nthe escrow agreement  and the  consent decree, and  based on  its\n\n\"intimate understanding of the  history and circumstances of th[e\n\nICC] litigation,\"  see United  States v. Massachusetts,  890 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n507,  510 (1st Cir. 1989), the district court determined that the\n\nprivate escrow agreement and the consent decree were \"synergistic\n\ndocuments,\"  negotiated  simultaneously,  which   contemplated  a\n\nsingle  escrow  fund     comprised  of  the  HTI  purchase monies\n      \n\nreceived by the Holmes  parties from Ruhland to  underwrite HTI's\n\ncontingent  liability for any  ICC refunds determined  due in the\n\npresent  action.

The \"Single-Fund\" Premise\n                                   \n\n          We discern no error in the district court ruling that a\n\nsingle fund was contemplated by the parties to the private escrow\n\nagreement  and  the consent  decree.    The \"single-escrow  fund\"\n\nruling  was supportably based on the following findings:  (1) the\n\n                                11\n\nparties to the private escrow agreement were aware of the impend-\n\ning  injunctive decree  and  even made  reference  to it  in  the\n\nprivate escrow agreement; (2)  the purpose of the parties  to the\n\nprivate  escrow agreement was to  fund the ICC refunds determined\n\ndue by HTI in the  present action; and (3) the consent  decree   \n\nreferring to but one escrow fund (and there being  no evidence of\n\nanother fund)    was signed  by Gunderman and by Seder  as repre-\n                                                                 \n\nsentative for the Holmes parties.5\n                                \n\n          Similarly, it  is relevant that the  ICC, envisioning a\n\nsingle  escrow account  from which the  freight refunds  would be\n\nmade, requested that the injunctive decree be forwarded to Seder,\n                                                       \n\nas  the legal  representative  of the  Holmes parties,  providing\n\nclear evidence that the ICC likewise recognized the obligation of\n\nthe Holmes  parties  to facilitate  disbursement of  the ICC  re-\n\nfunds.6    The understanding  of the  parties,  as well  as their\n\n                    \n\n     5Moreover,  since subsequent  conduct  of the  parties to  a\nconsent  decree may aid the interpretation of its intended scope,\nsee  Navarro-Ayala,  951 F.2d  at  1353 (Cyr,  J.,  concurring in\n                  \npart), we  likewise consider  it significant that  Ruhland repre-\nsented to Matarazzo, during their negotiations for the second HTI\nsale, that  the ICC refunds were  \"taken care of\" by  the private\nescrow fund.  As owner of Route USA, the initial purchaser of HTI\nfrom the Holmes parties, and as the source of the funds deposited\nunder the private  escrow agreement, Ruhland clearly  understood,\nprior to the onset of the  present dispute, that the function  of\nthe private escrow  agreement was to ensure the  funding required\nto implement the consent decree.\n\n     6Mr.  Gunderman, an escrow  agent, counsel  to HTI,  and the\nperson who  submitted the consent decree for  signature by Seder,\nmade the following representations to the court:\n\n     Mr. Robbins [an attorney for the  ICC] alluded to nego-\n     tiations that took place  while the agreement was being\n     finalized.  I  was the one that contacted  Mr. Robbins,\n     told Mr. Robbins that I am reading the order, the order\n\n                                12\n\nconduct, plainly  comports with the district court's  view of the\n\nprivate escrow  agreement and the consent  decree as \"synergistic\n\ndocuments\" whose  function  was  to  enable payment  of  the  ICC\n\nrefunds owed by HTI.  Taken together, the evidence provides ample\n\nsupport  for the district court  findings.  Nor  are its findings\n\nimpeached by the discrepancies  in the documents to which  appel-\n\nlants  point.  Rather, these  discrepancies give rise  at most to\n\nanother plausible view  of the  evidence.  \"Where  there are  two\n\npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder's  choice\n\nbetween  them cannot  be clearly erroneous.\"   Cumpiano  v. Banco\n                                                                 \n\nSantander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting\n                     \n\nAnderson v. City of  Bessemer City, 470  U.S. 564, 573, 574  (19-\n                                  \n\n85)).7\n\n                    \n\n     calls  for the creation of  an escrow fund.   I alerted\n     him to the fact that there was, in fact, an escrow fund\n     established,  and did  he  want us  to  go through  the\n     exercise of closing  one and  opening a new  one.   Mr.\n     Seder was clearly away  aware of that [sic].   When the\n     order  was  finalized, Mr.  Robbins  was  aware, I  was\n     aware,  and  Mr. Seder  was  aware, that  there  was an\n     escrow  fund called  for  in the  order,  and that  the\n     private  escrow  fund, if  you  will,  was intended  to\n     comply with the Court's order. . . .\n\nThus, Gunderman's  representations, as  an officer of  the court,\nthough  not  evidence per  se,  reinforced  the district  court's\n                             \ndetermination that at least HTI, Ruhland, and the  ICC envisioned\nthe private escrow fund as the sole source of funding for the ICC\nrefunds.  Moreover,  the district court  finding that the  Holmes\nparties acquiesced in the consent decree implementing this under-\nstanding  cannot be considered  clear error  in light  of Seder's\nexecution of the consent  decree in behalf of the  Holmes parties\nand as an escrow agent under the private escrow agreement.\n\n     7Most discrepancies between the documents, see supra note 2,\n                                                         \nare  reconciled  by according  the consent  decree  its due  as a\nmutual  modification  of the  escrow  agreement  to effect  their\ncommon purpose,  viz., to  fund disbursement  of the ICC  refunds\n                     \n\n                                13\n\n                    \n\npursuant to the district court decree.   Indeed, Escrow Agreement\n  11, on which the Holmes parties rest their claim to the escrow-\ned funds, appears  explicitly to  anticipate voluntary  modifica-\n                                            \ntions to its  expiration date  in light of  a subsequent  consent\ndecree;  it provides  that the  parties' escrow  obligations will\nexpire on \"March 16, 1988, or such later date as the  parties may\n                                                                 \nagree  in order  to  complete the  review  and repayment  of  all\n     \nunidentified and duplicate payments.\"\n\n                                14\n\n     2.   Seder's Capacity\n                          \n\n          As countervailing evidence to the  \"single-escrow fund\"\n\ntheory, and as a separate  basis for their claim to the  escrowed\n\nfunds, appellants contend that Seder did not sign the December 12\n\nconsent decree as their  attorney, but rather as counsel  to HTI.\n\nTherefore, they  contend, the  consent decree among  Ruhland, HTI\n\nand the ICC did not  bind them; rather, their rights  and obliga-\n\ntions continued to  be governed by the private  escrow agreement,\n\nwhich expired March 16, 1989, by its own terms.\n\n          Their argument is unavailing.  Regardless whether Seder\n\nrepresented HTI or the Holmes parties, the district court finding\n\nthat  the  escrowed  funds  were specifically  dedicated  to  the\n\nsettlement of HTI's contingent liabilities, and were uncondition-\n\nally  intended for  that purpose,  meant that  there could  be no\n\nentitlement  to recoup the funds until the ICC refunds were paid.\n\nSee  30A C.J.S. Escrows    5(a) (\"to constitute  an instrument an\n   \n\nescrow, it must  be deposited  with the intention  that it  shall\n\ntake effect on  the performance  of an express  condition or  the\n\nhappening of a certain event . . .

Control  of  HTI had  been  transferred to  Ruhland  in\n\nFebruary  1988;  Gunderman served  as  Ruhland's  counsel and  as\n\ncounsel  to the  company after  that date.   Seder,  by contrast,\n\nrepresented the Holmes parties,  not HTI, throughout the negotia-\n                              \n\ntions  for the sale  of HTI.   There is no  indication that Seder\n\nentered an appearance for  HTI, participated in negotiations with\n\nthe ICC, or  rendered significant professional services to HTI in\n\nconnection with the ICC refund claims.  Prior to that time, Seder\n\nhad  never entered an appearance  for HTI in  the present litiga-\n\ntion; never  billed HTI for professional  services in furtherance\n\nof  its  settlement  with  ICC; and  never  rendered  significant\n\n                                16\n\nprofessional services to  HTI in connection  with the ICC  refund\n\nclaims.8   Furthermore, as  the district  court found,  given his\n\ninexperience  with ICC  rules and  regulations, there  was little\n\napparent  reason for HTI to  retain Seder in  the present litiga-\n\ntion.9\n\n     3.   The Agency Question\n                             \n\n          Appellants further  assert that even if  Seder did sign\n\nthe consent decree in their  behalf, he had not been vested  with\n\nthe proper authority under Massachusetts law.  \n\n          Although, under Massachusetts law, the \"general powers\"\n\nof an attorney to represent a client do not  entail the authority\n\neither to settle a case, see Precious v. O'Rourke, 270 Mass. 305,\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n      8Appellants contend that the material inquiry  for purposes\nof  determining  the significance  of  Seder's  signature on  the\nconsent decree is not Seder's  actual role, but ICC's understand-\ning of his  role, since Seder signed the decree  at ICC's behest.\nThey argue  that a September 14, 1988  letter, allegedly excluded\nimproperly  by the district court, showed that the ICC understood\nthat Seder was  acting in behalf of HTI,  not the Holmes parties.\nOur review of  the September 14  letter persuades us  that it  is\nambiguous  as concerns  Seder's role  in negotiating  the consent\ndecree, and  that its exclusion, even if  erroneous, was harmless\nerror.\n\n     9Once again appellants point to contrary evidence, including\nthe letter adverted to above, see supra note 8, and the fact that\n                                       \nthe consent  decree contained  no signature line  for the  Holmes\nparties.  Their  arguments are not compelling.  Above Gunderman's\nsignature on the consent decree appears the legend \"Attorneys for\nDefendant,\"  which reasonably can be read to refer to the Gunder-\nman law  firm.  Although Seder's signature  appears below Gunder-\nman's, the document does not clearly identify Seder's affiliation\nwith any particular party to the  action.  At best, the proffered\n        \nevidence is ambiguous, suggesting an alternative  inference which\nmight reasonably be drawn, but not warranting reversal  on \"clear\nerror\"  review.  See Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152 (quoting Anderson,\n                                                                \n470 U.S. at 573-74).\n\n                                17\n\n170 N.E. 110 (1930),  or to make substantial modifications  to an\n\nexisting contract, cf.

Holmes  Fund (\"Holmes  Trust\"), and\n\nDorothy  Holmes, as  trustee  of the  Holmes Trust  (hereinafter,\n\ncollectively, \"Holmes  parties\"), appeal  a district  court order\n\ndirecting  the  disbursement of  an  escrow  fund established  to\n\ndefray certain civil liabilities relating to their sale of Holmes\n\nTransportation, Inc.  (\"HTI\"), a corporation wholly  owned by the\n\nHolmes  parties.  The  Holmes parties are joined  on appeal by J.\n\nRobert  Seder,  Esquire,  a  former escrow  agent  for  the fund.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction  having been retained, and certain prelim-\n\ninary matters having been  resolved on remand, we proceed  to the\n\nmerits and affirm the district court order.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          First  we  describe the  somewhat intricate  context in\n\nwhich  the  present litigation  developed.    The Holmes  parties\n\nentered  into negotiations  in  1988 to  sell  HTI to  Route  USA\n\nResources,  Inc. (\"Route  USA\"), a  corporation wholly  owned and\n\ncontrolled  by  Manfred  Ruhland.   Throughout  the negotiations,\n\nSeder represented  the Holmes  parties, and Robert  D. Gunderman,\n\nEsquire, represented Ruhland and Route USA.   Ruhland had assumed\n\ncontrol of HTI, and consummation of  the sale of HTI to Route USA\n\nappeared   imminent,  when  the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission\n\n(\"ICC\")  initiated the  present  action against  HTI on  July 13,\n\n                                3\n\n1988, to recover $501,976 in refunds allegedly due HTI  customers\n\nfor freight  overpayments improperly  withheld by HTI  during the\n\nperiod 1984-1988 (\"ICC refunds\").1\n\n          The ICC action  threatened to derail  the HTI sale,  as\n\nRuhland demanded  a  reduction in  the purchase  price to  offset\n\nHTI's  contingent liability on the  ICC refund claims.   In order\n\nfor the  HTI sale to proceed, the Holmes parties agreed to escrow\n\n$500,000  of Ruhland's purchase  money deposit to  defray the ICC\n\nrefund claims against  HTI (the \"private escrow  agreement\").  On\n\nSeptember 22,  1988, Seder executed the  private escrow agreement\n\nas \"attorney in fact\" for the Holmes parties; Ruhland executed it\n\nin behalf of Route USA; Seder and Gunderman executed it as desig-\n\nnated escrow agents under the private escrow agreement.  With the\n\nICC refunds obstacle apparently  resolved, Ruhland abandoned  the\n\ndemand  for a reduction in the HTI purchase price, and the Holmes\n\nparties' sale of HTI's stock to Route USA was consummated without\n\nfurther incident.\n\n          While the private escrow agreement was  being negotiat-\n\ned,  HTI proposed  a settlement  of the  ICC refund  claims.   On\n\nDecember 12,  1988, HTI,  represented by Gunderman,  consented to\n\nthe entry  of a district  court injunctive  decree (\"consent  de-\n\ncree\") mandating, in pertinent part, that HTI establish an escrow\n\nfund  containing at least  $502,000 with  which all  HTI customer\n\n                    \n\n     1The ICC complaint did not name the Holmes parties as defen-\ndants,  but alleged that HTI  failed to process  and refund 3,048\nunidentified payments and 3,485 duplicate payments received  from\nshippers, in violation of 49 C.F.R.    1008.9(a) and 1008.9(b).\n\n                                4\n\noverpayments  were  to be  refunded  by December 31,  1988.   For\n\nreasons which  remain unclear, neither  the ICC nor  the district\n\ncourt  had yet  been  apprised of  the  private escrow  agreement\n\npreviously  executed between  the Holmes  parties and  Route USA.\n\nThus,  the   escrow  account  arrangements   envisioned  in   the\n\nDecember 12 consent decree varied in considerable detail from the\n\nterms of the private escrow agreement  between the Holmes parties\n\nand  Route  USA.2   Their function  was  identical, however:   to\n\nestablish  and preserve  a  fund for  defraying  the ICC  refunds\n\ndetermined to  be due HTI's overcharged customers  in the present\n\naction.\n\n          The  Holmes parties  were  not parties  to the  present\n\naction  at  the time  the consent  decree  was entered.    At the\n\ninstance  of the ICC, however, the consent decree was executed by\n\nSeder, who  had represented the Holmes parties throughout the HTI\n\nnegotiations  with Ruhland and Route  USA.  As  Gunderman and HTI\n\n(but not the ICC) were well aware, of course, Seder and Gunderman\n\n                    \n\n     2The private escrow agreement  provided that (1) the refunds\nwere  to be made by HTI in  the first instance, and reimbursed by\nthe escrow  fund in $25,000 increments upon certification by HTI;\n(2) the escrowed funds were to remain the property of  the Holmes\nparties,  and, if not disbursed by March 16, 1989, were to revert\nto them;  (3) the escrowed funds  were to be used  only to defray\nobligations accruing prior to  February 3, 1988 (the date Ruhland\nassumed  operational control of HTI);  and (4) the escrow account\nwas to be deposited in a state-chartered financial institution.\n     The  consent decree, on  the other  hand, provided  that (1)\nrefund  payments were to be made directly from the escrow account\nto the overcharged shippers; (2) all refunds (whether originating\nbefore or after February 3, 1988) were to be made from the escrow\naccount;  (3) the escrow account  was not to  terminate until all\nrefunds  were made; and only then were any undistributed funds to\nrevert to HTI; and  (4) the escrow account was  to be established\nin a federally-chartered financial institution.\n\n                                5\n\nwere the designated escrow agents under the private escrow  fund.\n\nNo refunds were ever disbursed.\n\n          On July 14, 1989, Ruhland  sold HTI to Anthony Mataraz-\n\nzo.   Matarazzo was notified  of the ICC  action against HTI, but\n\nwas  informed by Gunderman that  the ICC refund  claims were \"al-\n\nready taken care of\" and that a $500,000 escrow  account had been\n\nset aside  to defray the refunds.   The Holmes  parties had other\n\nplans  for the  escrowed funds.   On  July 18,  1989, the  Holmes\n\nparties initiated a declaratory  judgment action in Massachusetts\n\nSuperior  Court, to  recoup the funds  deposited pursuant  to the\n\nprivate escrow agreement.   Meanwhile, the ICC  became aware that\n\nthe refunds  required  under  the  consent decree  had  not  been\n\ndisbursed.\n\n          On September 14,  1989, the  ICC convened a  meeting of\n\npersons  associated with HTI and  with the original  lawsuit.  At\n\nthe  meeting, the ICC was  informed of the  Holmes parties' state\n\ncourt lawsuit and was furnished for the first time with copies of\n\nthe  private escrow  agreement.   Matarazzo,  in  behalf of  HTI,\n\nagreed to effect the overdue ICC refunds within 30 days, provided\n\nSeder and Gunderman, as escrow agents, would release the escrowed\n\nfunds.   Gunderman agreed.   Seder declined,  however, contending\n\nthat (1) the Holmes parties' obligations under the private escrow\n\nagreement terminated on March 16, 1989, (2) Seder's signature had\n\nnot  bound the Holmes parties to the  consent decree, and (3) the\n\nHolmes parties were  therefore entitled to  recover the funds  in\n\nescrow.\n\n                                6\n\n          On  October 13,  1989,  the Holmes  parties  and  Seder\n\nintervened in  the present action, demanding  a judicial declara-\n\ntion entitling the Holmes parties  to the escrow funds.  The  ICC\n\ncountered with  a civil contempt citation  against Seder, Gunder-\n\nman,  Ruhland, Route USA, HTI, and Matarazzo.  The ICC contended,\n\ninter alia, that Seder  and Gunderman, by their execution  of the\n          \n\nconsent decree, subjected the  escrowed funds to the jurisdiction\n\nof  the district  court for  disposition  in accordance  with the\n\nterms  of the  consent decree.   The  ICC further  contended that\n\nGunderman and Seder, as escrow agents, failed to provide  prudent\n\nsupervision relating to HTI's obligation to disburse the escrowed\n\nfunds in  accordance with  the terms of  the consent  decree.   A\n\nbarrage  of cross-claims  and  counterclaims ensued.   On  Decem-\n\nber 15,  1989, HTI filed a  voluntary chapter 11  petition in the\n\nDistrict of New Jersey.\n\n          On January 26, 1990, after  an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court  issued its  findings of fact,  and concluded,  in\n\npertinent  part, that  (1)  the consent  decree  and the  private\n\nescrow  agreement were negotiated simultaneously as \"synergistic\"\n\ndocuments intended to  ensure funding of the  ICC refunds antici-\n\npated under  the  consent  decree;  (2) the  consent  decree  was\n\nexecuted by Seder  as attorney for  the Holmes  parties and as  a\n\ndesignated escrow  agent under the private  escrow agreement; and\n\n(3) the consent decree was \"the only operative document\" defining\n\nthe legal obligations  of Seder  and Gunderman  relating to  dis-\n\nbursements from the escrow fund.  The district court rejected the\n\n                                7\n\nHolmes parties' claims to the escrow fund, and held HTI and Seder\n\nin  civil  contempt for  refusing  to  disburse the  ICC  refunds\n\npursuant to  the  consent  decree.3   Seder  and  Gunderman  were\n\nreplaced as escrow agents  by Frank Weiner, an HTI  attorney, who\n\nwas directed to  disburse the ICC refunds by March 30,  1990.  We\n\nstayed disbursements pending appeal.\n\n          On April 1,  1992, following remand, see  ICC v. Holmes\n                                                                 \n\nTransp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560357\"><a href=\"/opinion/560357/bankr-l-rep-p-73966-interstate-commerce-commission-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1991), the  district court\n             \n\nvacated its  contempt finding  against Seder and  Gunderman,4 but\n\nreaffirmed its  order directing  disbursement of the  ICC refunds\n\nfrom the escrow fund in accordance with  the terms of the consent\n\ndecree.

We disagree.\n\n          The thrust of their argument is that the private escrow\n\nagreement  and  the district  court  consent decree  contemplated\n\nseparate  and unrelated funds from which the ICC refunds would be\n                       \n\ndisbursed:  a \"private escrow fund,\" established under the escrow\n\nagreement and belonging  to the Holmes parties,  which lay beyond\n\nthe  jurisdictional  reach of  the  district court;  and  an \"ICC\n\nfund,\" established  by the consent  decree, which was  within the\n\ncontrol of the court  but imposed legal obligations only  on HTI.\n                                                                \n\nTo the extent that the district court purportedly subjected their\n\nprivately-created fund to the  consent decree, the Holmes parties\n\ncontend that  it lacked jurisdiction and  disregarded the express\n\nterms of their private escrow agreement.

The \"Single-Fund\" Premise\n                                   \n\n          We discern no error in the district court ruling that a\n\nsingle fund was contemplated by the parties to the private escrow\n\nagreement  and  the consent  decree.    The \"single-escrow  fund\"\n\nruling  was supportably based on the following findings:  (1) the\n\n                                11\n\nparties to the private escrow agreement were aware of the impend-\n\ning  injunctive decree  and  even made  reference  to it  in  the\n\nprivate escrow agreement; (2)  the purpose of the parties  to the\n\nprivate  escrow agreement was to  fund the ICC refunds determined\n\ndue by HTI in the  present action; and (3) the consent  decree   \n\nreferring to but one escrow fund (and there being  no evidence of\n\nanother fund)    was signed  by Gunderman and by Seder  as repre-\n                                                                 \n\nsentative for the Holmes parties.5\n                                \n\n          Similarly, it  is relevant that the  ICC, envisioning a\n\nsingle  escrow account  from which the  freight refunds  would be\n\nmade, requested that the injunctive decree be forwarded to Seder,\n                                                       \n\nas  the legal  representative  of the  Holmes parties,  providing\n\nclear evidence that the ICC likewise recognized the obligation of\n\nthe Holmes  parties  to facilitate  disbursement of  the ICC  re-\n\nfunds.6    The understanding  of the  parties,  as well  as their\n\n                    \n\n     5Moreover,  since subsequent  conduct  of the  parties to  a\nconsent  decree may aid the interpretation of its intended scope,\nsee  Navarro-Ayala,  951 F.2d  at  1353 (Cyr,  J.,  concurring in\n                  \npart), we  likewise consider  it significant that  Ruhland repre-\nsented to Matarazzo, during their negotiations for the second HTI\nsale, that  the ICC refunds were  \"taken care of\" by  the private\nescrow fund.  As owner of Route USA, the initial purchaser of HTI\nfrom the Holmes parties, and as the source of the funds deposited\nunder the private  escrow agreement, Ruhland clearly  understood,\nprior to the onset of the  present dispute, that the function  of\nthe private escrow  agreement was to ensure the  funding required\nto implement the consent decree.\n\n     6Mr.  Gunderman, an escrow  agent, counsel  to HTI,  and the\nperson who  submitted the consent decree for  signature by Seder,\nmade the following representations to the court:\n\n     Mr. Robbins [an attorney for the  ICC] alluded to nego-\n     tiations that took place  while the agreement was being\n     finalized.  I  was the one that contacted  Mr. Robbins,\n     told Mr. Robbins that I am reading the order, the order\n\n                                12\n\nconduct, plainly  comports with the district court's  view of the\n\nprivate escrow  agreement and the consent  decree as \"synergistic\n\ndocuments\" whose  function  was  to  enable payment  of  the  ICC\n\nrefunds owed by HTI.  Taken together, the evidence provides ample\n\nsupport  for the district court  findings.  Nor  are its findings\n\nimpeached by the discrepancies  in the documents to which  appel-\n\nlants  point.  Rather, these  discrepancies give rise  at most to\n\nanother plausible view  of the  evidence.  \"Where  there are  two\n\npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder's  choice\n\nbetween  them cannot  be clearly erroneous.\"   Cumpiano  v.

I alerted\n     him to the fact that there was, in fact, an escrow fund\n     established,  and did  he  want us  to  go through  the\n     exercise of closing  one and  opening a new  one.   Mr.\n     Seder was clearly away  aware of that [sic].   When the\n     order  was  finalized, Mr.  Robbins  was  aware, I  was\n     aware,  and  Mr. Seder  was  aware, that  there  was an\n     escrow  fund called  for  in the  order,  and that  the\n     private  escrow  fund, if  you  will,  was intended  to\n     comply with the Court's order. . . .\n\nThus, Gunderman's  representations, as  an officer of  the court,\nthough  not  evidence per  se,  reinforced  the district  court's\n                             \ndetermination that at least HTI, Ruhland, and the  ICC envisioned\nthe private escrow fund as the sole source of funding for the ICC\nrefunds.  Moreover,  the district court  finding that the  Holmes\nparties acquiesced in the consent decree implementing this under-\nstanding  cannot be considered  clear error  in light  of Seder's\nexecution of the consent  decree in behalf of the  Holmes parties\nand as an escrow agent under the private escrow agreement.\n\n     7Most discrepancies between the documents, see supra note 2,\n                                                         \nare  reconciled  by according  the consent  decree  its due  as a\nmutual  modification  of the  escrow  agreement  to effect  their\ncommon purpose,  viz., to  fund disbursement  of the ICC  refunds\n                     \n\n                                13\n\n                    \n\npursuant to the district court decree.   Indeed, Escrow Agreement\n  11, on which the Holmes parties rest their claim to the escrow-\ned funds, appears  explicitly to  anticipate voluntary  modifica-\n                                            \ntions to its  expiration date  in light of  a subsequent  consent\ndecree;  it provides  that the  parties' escrow  obligations will\nexpire on \"March 16, 1988, or such later date as the  parties may\n                                                                 \nagree  in order  to  complete the  review  and repayment  of  all\n     \nunidentified and duplicate payments.\"\n\n                                14\n\n     2.   Seder's Capacity\n                          \n\n          As countervailing evidence to the  \"single-escrow fund\"\n\ntheory, and as a separate  basis for their claim to the  escrowed\n\nfunds, appellants contend that Seder did not sign the December 12\n\nconsent decree as their  attorney, but rather as counsel  to HTI.\n\nTherefore, they  contend, the  consent decree among  Ruhland, HTI\n\nand the ICC did not  bind them; rather, their rights  and obliga-\n\ntions continued to  be governed by the private  escrow agreement,\n\nwhich expired March 16, 1989, by its own terms.\n\n          Their argument is unavailing.  Regardless whether Seder\n\nrepresented HTI or the Holmes parties, the district court finding\n\nthat  the  escrowed  funds  were specifically  dedicated  to  the\n\nsettlement of HTI's contingent liabilities, and were uncondition-\n\nally  intended for  that purpose,  meant that  there could  be no\n\nentitlement  to recoup the funds until the ICC refunds were paid.\n\nSee  30A C.J.S.

Control  of  HTI had  been  transferred to  Ruhland  in\n\nFebruary  1988;  Gunderman served  as  Ruhland's  counsel and  as\n\ncounsel  to the  company after  that date.

There is no  indication that Seder\n\nentered an appearance for  HTI, participated in negotiations with\n\nthe ICC, or  rendered significant professional services to HTI in\n\nconnection with the ICC refund claims.  Prior to that time, Seder\n\nhad  never entered an appearance  for HTI in  the present litiga-\n\ntion; never  billed HTI for professional  services in furtherance\n\nof  its  settlement  with  ICC; and  never  rendered  significant\n\n                                16\n\nprofessional services to  HTI in connection  with the ICC  refund\n\nclaims.8   Furthermore, as  the district  court found,  given his\n\ninexperience  with ICC  rules and  regulations, there  was little\n\napparent  reason for HTI to  retain Seder in  the present litiga-\n\ntion.9\n\n     3.   The Agency Question\n                             \n\n          Appellants further  assert that even if  Seder did sign\n\nthe consent decree in their  behalf, he had not been vested  with\n\nthe proper authority under Massachusetts law.  \n\n          Although, under Massachusetts law, the \"general powers\"\n\nof an attorney to represent a client do not  entail the authority\n\neither to settle a case, see Precious v.

Their  arguments are not compelling.  Above Gunderman's\nsignature on the consent decree appears the legend \"Attorneys for\nDefendant,\"  which reasonably can be read to refer to the Gunder-\nman law  firm.  Although Seder's signature  appears below Gunder-\nman's, the document does not clearly identify Seder's affiliation\nwith any particular party to the  action.  At best, the proffered\n        \nevidence is ambiguous, suggesting an alternative  inference which\nmight reasonably be drawn, but not warranting reversal  on \"clear\nerror\"  review.
