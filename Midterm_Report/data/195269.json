Defendant  was\n          BOWNES,   Senior  Circuit  Judge.\n                                          \n\napprehended in  a taxicab after robbing a bank.  After a two-\n\ncount indictment  was returned charging  defendant with armed\n\nbank robbery, he moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a\n\nresult of  the stop and search of the taxicab in which he was\n\na passenger at  the time of his  arrest.  The district  court\n\nheld  a hearing  on the  motion and  denied it,  making bench\n\nfindings  and  rulings.    The  next  day  defendant  offered\n\nconditional guilty  pleas to  both counts of  the indictment,\n\nreserving the right to  appeal from the denial of  the motion\n\nto suppress.    The  court  accepted  the  guilty  pleas  and\n\nsentenced  defendant to  180  months of  incarceration to  be\n\nfollowed  by 36  months of  supervised release.   Defendant's\n\nclaim  on appeal  is that  the evidence  failed to  establish\n\nreasonable suspicion for the stop and search of the taxi.\n\n                         THE EVIDENCE\n                                     \n\n          Our evidentiary review begins during  the afternoon\n\nof  September  19,  1991,  in  Robert's  Bakery  in  Needham,\n\nMassachusetts.  The weather  was overcast, threatening  rain.\n\nThe owner of  the bakery,  Robert DiMarino, Jr.,  was in  the\n\nback  room when  his  attention was  drawn  to a  man  on the\n\nsidewalk shouting  through the window at  Marino's mother who\n\nwas  in the customer area of the restaurant.  Marino inquired\n\nas to what was going on and  she told him that the man wanted\n\nher to call a taxi for  him.  Marino told his mother to  make\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nthe call.  She  called Veteran's Taxi Company in  Needham and\n\nwas asked by the dispatcher the passenger's destination.  She\n\nrepeated the question to the man  and was told that he wanted\n\nto go to Newton Center.\n\n          After the  call was  completed, it started  to rain\n\nand the man who  had requested the taxi came into  the bakery\n\nto  wait for  it.   He was  a tall,  thin black  male wearing\n\njeans,  a brown striped  pullover and an  oversized black and\n\nwhite knit cap.   Within  a few minutes  a Veteran's  taxicab\n\narrived to pick up the  man.  He came  out of the bakery  and\n\nasked  the cab driver  if he would  wait a few  minutes so he\n\ncould find  out if his  wife was  going to  accompany him  to\n\nNewton Center.  He then left the area.\n\n          Within a  very short  time, a  man walked  into the\n\nNeedham  Cooperative Bank.    The bank  is  located down  the\n\nstreet and around the  corner from Robert's Bakery.   He went\n\ndirectly to teller  stations two  and three in  the bank  and\n\nafter  a short  conversation  with the  tellers proceeded  to\n\nscoop money out  of the  cash drawers.   Surveillance  photos\n\nshow  him doing  this.   The  assistant manager  observed the\n\nrobber as did a  young woman, Yvonne Welch, who  was standing\n\nnext to him.  During the robbery, the robber wore a ski mask.\n\n          While the robbery was proceeding, an officer of the\n\nbank, Mr. McGeorge, was on the phone talking to his wife.  He\n\ntold her that the bank was being robbed and asked her to call\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthe  police.  Three other bank employees called the police to\n\nreport a robbery in progress.   In at least one of  the calls\n\nthe robber was described as a  tall, thin black man wearing a\n\nbrown sweater  and blue jeans with his  face covered by a ski\n\nmask.   The Needham Police dispatcher radioed to all units in\n\nNeedham  that an armed robbery was in progress at the Needham\n\nCooperative  Bank involving  a black  male wearing  a striped\n\nbrown sweater. \n\n          The  robber left the bank on foot.  He was followed\n\nby the bank officer, McGeorge, through  a parking lot leading\n\nto  the street  on which  the taxi  was parked.   The  robber\n\neither fortuitously  or purposely eluded McGeorge.  McGeorge,\n\nhowever, got close enough  to see the robber's face,  the ski\n\nmask  having  been removed.    About  ten minutes  after  the\n\nrobbery, the man who  had called for the taxi,  signalled the\n\ntaxi  which had been waiting for him.   He got into the taxi,\n\ntold the driver that  his wife was not coming with  him, that\n\nhe felt ill and was going to lie down on the back seat, which\n\nhe did.\n\n          Our  exposition  now  brings us  back  to  Robert's\n\nBakery.  Within moments of the robbery, or during it, Needham\n\nPolice Officer Arthur Douglas walked into the bakery.  He was\n\nknown to the proprietor, who told him about his mother's call\n\nfor a  taxi for a man and the conversation between his mother\n\nand the man  requesting the call.  As Douglas  was going into\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nthe rear of the store for tea  and a pastry, he heard on  his\n\nportable  radio that there was a robbery at the Needham Bank.\n\nDouglas immediately  ran to the bank,  obtained a description\n\nof the  robber and  then  ran back  to the  bakery  to get  a\n\ndescription of the  man who had used  the proprietor's mother\n\nto  call a taxi.  Both descriptions dovetailed.  Douglas also\n\nlearned  that  the  taxi's  destination  was  Newton  Center.\n\nDouglas then radioed to Newton Police Sergeant Albert Droney,\n\ngave him a description of the bank robber,  and told him that\n\nthe bank robber was  in a red Veteran's cab  headed to Newton\n\nCenter.     Droney,  in   turn,  called  the   Newton  Police\n\ndispatcher, gave him  a description of the  bank robber, told\n\nhim to give this information to the Newton Police and to tell\n\nthem that the robber  was in a red Veteran's  taxicab heading\n\ndown Highland Avenue in Needham towards Newton.\n\n          Newton Police Officer David Richard was  sitting in\n\nhis  cruiser  on  Center  Street   in  Newton,  which  is   a\n\ncontinuation of  Highland  Avenue,  when  the  Newton  Police\n\nbroadcast the robbery information.  Immediately after hearing\n\nthe  broadcast, Richard saw and stopped the taxi.  The robber\n\nwas found  on the rear floor of the taxi on top of his beret,\n\nwhich  contained the money stolen from the bank.  The Needham\n\nPolice subsequently arrived with witnesses to the robbery who\n\nunhesitatingly identified defendant as the bank robber.  This\n\nends our recitation of the relevant facts.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          There is, however,  a humorous  episode that  bears\n\nre-telling.  During  the time that the information  about the\n\nbank robber  travelling in a  Veteran's cab to  Newton Center\n\nwas being  broadcast, another  Veteran's  cab was  travelling\n\nfrom Needham Junction to Needham Heights.  It was carrying as\n\npassengers two  Amtrak engineers.   As the  cab approached  a\n\ntraffic  light intersection,  the light  turned yellow.   The\n\ndriver,  neverthe- less, proceeded  through the intersection.\n\nAs he  did  so, one  of the  passengers informed  him that  a\n\npolice cruiser  with its  blue lights flashing  was following\n\nthem.   The driver pulled  the cab  over to the  side of  the\n\nroad.  The cruiser came  alongside and police officers jumped\n\nout  with weapons drawn.  The driver  got out of his cab with\n\nhis hands raised and said, \"I'll never go through a red light\n\nagain.\"\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          There is  no  need to  tarry long  on the  analysis\n\nrequired.  It is familiar terrain.\n\n             The constitutionality of the officers'\n          stop   and   search  must   be  evaluated\n          according to the  now familiar  two-prong\n          test  articulated by the Supreme Court in\n          Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868,\n                       \n          20 L.Ed.2d  889.   Determining  that  the\n          Fourth Amendment regulates  but does  not\n          prohibit  temporary detentions  that fall\n          short  of a full-scale  arrest, the Court\n          in Terry held  that such encounters  must\n                  \n          be  justified   by  reasonable  suspicion\n          proportional to the degree  of intrusion.\n          Thus, in reviewing the  reasonableness of\n          a  Terry  stop,   the  court  must  first\n                  \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          consider whether the officer's action was\n          justified at its inception;  and, second,\n          whether the action  taken was  reasonably\n          related  in  scope  to the  circumstances\n          which justified the  interference in  the\n          first  place.   United States  v. Sharpe,\n                                                  \n          470  U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573,\n          94 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (quoting Terry, 392\n                                              \n          U.S.  1, 20,  88  S.Ct.  1868,  1879,  20\n          L.Ed.2d 889).  The circumstances \"are not\n          to be dissected and viewed singly; rather\n          they  must  be  considered  as  a whole.\"\n          United  States v.  Trullo, 809  F.2d 108,\n                                   \n          111  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  482 U.S.\n                                        \n          916,  107  S.Ct.  3191,  196  L.Ed.2d 679\n          (1987).\n\nUnited  States v. Stanley, 915  F.2d 54, 55  (1st Cir. 1990).\n                         \n\nDefendant's argument boils down to this:\n\n          Because  the  Needham police  officer who\n          issued  the  radio   bulletin  lacked   a\n          reasonable   suspicion   concerning   the\n          taxicab  stopped  in Newton,  and because\n          Officer    Richard    had    insufficient\n          information to justify stopping the taxi,\n          the District Court  erred when it  denied\n          the motion to suppress.\n\nDefendant's  Brief at 14.   The facts establish the contrary.\n\nThe Needham police officer who issued the  radio bulletin had\n\nbeen  given  a description  of the  bank  robber by  a fellow\n\npolice officer.   This  officer had obtained  the description\n\nfrom  eye  witnesses  to  the  robbery.    The  same  officer\n\n(Douglas) determined  that this  description matched  that of\n\nthe man who had used the clerk in Robert's Bakery (the mother\n\nof  the proprietor)  to obtain  a taxi.   It  did not  take a\n\nSherlock  Holmes to deduce that  the bank robber  and the man\n\nwho requested  the taxi were one  and the same.   It was more\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthan  a  reasonable suspicion;  it  was  a perfectly  logical\n\ndeduction.  The bank robber  had told the woman who  made the\n\ntaxi call  for him  that his  destination was  Newton Center.\n\nThis  information  was  also  given  to  the  Needham  police\n\ndispatcher who passed  it along  to the Newton  Police.   The\n\nNewton Police Officer who saw and stopped the taxi containing\n\nthe  robber had been  informed that the  robber was in  a red\n\nVeteran's taxicab which was  proceeding to Newton Center from\n\nNeedham.   The cab  he stopped and  searched was  of the type\n\ndescribed, and was proceeding  from Needham to Newton Center.\n\nOn the basis  of the information he had, his  duty was clear:\n\nstop the cab and check its passenger.  No  amount of forensic\n\nskill can erase the  clear reasonable suspicion that resulted\n\nin the stop  and search of the taxi in  which defendant hoped\n\nto make his getaway.\n\n          Although  the facts  of this  case are  unique, the\n\napplication of the law to the facts dictate that the judgment\n\nbelow be \n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

After a two-count indictment was returned charging defendant with armed bank robbery, he moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the stop and search of the taxicab in which he was a passenger at the time of his arrest.  The district court held a hearing on the motion and denied it, making bench findings and rulings.  The next day defendant offered conditional guilty pleas to both counts of the indictment, reserving the right to appeal from the denial of the motion to suppress.  The court accepted the guilty pleas and sentenced defendant to 180 months of incarceration to be followed by 36 months of supervised release.  Defendant's claim on appeal is that the evidence failed to establish reasonable suspicion for the stop and search of the taxi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our evidentiary review begins during the afternoon of September 19, 1991, in Robert's Bakery in Needham, Massachusetts.  The weather was overcast, threatening rain.  The owner of the bakery, Robert DiMarino, Jr., was in the back room when his attention was drawn to a man on the sidewalk shouting through the window at Marino's mother who was in the customer area of the restaurant.  Marino inquired as to what was going on and she told him that the man wanted her to call a taxi for him.  Marino told his mother to make the call.  She called Veteran's Taxi Company in Needham and was asked by the dispatcher the passenger's destination.  She repeated the question to the man and was told that he wanted to go to Newton Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the call was completed, it started to rain and the man who had requested the taxi came into the bakery to wait for it.  He was a tall, thin black male wearing jeans, a brown striped pullover and an oversized black and white knit cap.  Within a few minutes a Veteran's taxicab arrived to pick up the man.  He came out of the bakery and asked the cab driver if he would wait a few minutes so he could find out if his wife was going to accompany him to Newton Center.  He then left the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a very short time, a man walked into the Needham Cooperative Bank.  The bank is located down the street and around the corner from Robert's Bakery.  He went directly to teller stations two and three in the bank and after a short conversation with the tellers proceeded to scoop money out of the cash drawers.  Surveillance photos show him doing this.  The assistant manager observed the robber as did a young woman, Yvonne Welch, who was standing next to him.  During the robbery, the robber wore a ski mask.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the robbery was proceeding, an officer of the bank, Mr. McGeorge, was on the phone talking to his wife.  He told her that the bank was being robbed and asked her to call the police.  Three other bank employees called the police to report a robbery in progress.  In at least one of the calls the robber was described as a tall, thin black man wearing a brown sweater and blue jeans with his face covered by a ski mask.  The Needham Police dispatcher radioed to all units in Needham that an armed robbery was in progress at the Needham Cooperative Bank involving a black male wearing a striped brown sweater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The robber left the bank on foot.  He was followed by the bank officer, McGeorge, through a parking lot leading to the street on which the taxi was parked.  The robber either fortuitously or purposely eluded McGeorge.  McGeorge, however, got close enough to see the robber's face, the ski mask having been removed.  About ten minutes after the robbery, the man who had called for the taxi, signalled the taxi which had been waiting for him.  He got into the taxi, told the driver that his wife was not coming with him, that he felt ill and was going to lie down on the back seat, which he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our exposition now brings us back to Robert's Bakery.  Within moments of the robbery, or during it, Needham Police Officer Arthur Douglas walked into the bakery.  He was known to the proprietor, who told him about his mother's call for a taxi for a man and the conversation between his mother and the man requesting the call.  As Douglas was going into the rear of the store for tea and a pastry, he heard on his portable radio that there was a robbery at the Needham Bank.  Douglas immediately ran to the bank, obtained a description of the robber and then ran back to the bakery to get a description of the man who had used the proprietor's mother to call a taxi.  Both descriptions dovetailed.  Douglas also learned that the taxi's destination was Newton Center.

The facts establish the contrary.  The Needham police officer who issued the radio bulletin had been given a description of the bank robber by a fellow police officer.

This information was also given to the Needham police dispatcher who passed it along to the Newton Police.

After a two-count indictment was returned charging defendant with armed bank robbery, he moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the stop and search of the taxicab in which he was a passenger at the time of his arrest.  The district court held a hearing on the motion and denied it, making bench findings and rulings.  The next day defendant offered conditional guilty pleas to both counts of the indictment, reserving the right to appeal from the denial of the motion to suppress.  The court accepted the guilty pleas and sentenced defendant to 180 months of incarceration to be followed by 36 months of supervised release.  Defendant's claim on appeal is that the evidence failed to establish reasonable suspicion for the stop and search of the taxi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our evidentiary review begins during the afternoon of September 19, 1991, in Robert's Bakery in Needham, Massachusetts.  The weather was overcast, threatening rain.  The owner of the bakery, Robert DiMarino, Jr., was in the back room when his attention was drawn to a man on the sidewalk shouting through the window at Marino's mother who was in the customer area of the restaurant.  Marino inquired as to what was going on and she told him that the man wanted her to call a taxi for him.  Marino told his mother to make the call.  She called Veteran's Taxi Company in Needham and was asked by the dispatcher the passenger's destination.  She repeated the question to the man and was told that he wanted to go to Newton Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the call was completed, it started to rain and the man who had requested the taxi came into the bakery to wait for it.  He was a tall, thin black male wearing jeans, a brown striped pullover and an oversized black and white knit cap.  Within a few minutes a Veteran's taxicab arrived to pick up the man.  He came out of the bakery and asked the cab driver if he would wait a few minutes so he could find out if his wife was going to accompany him to Newton Center.  He then left the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a very short time, a man walked into the Needham Cooperative Bank.  The bank is located down the street and around the corner from Robert's Bakery.  He went directly to teller stations two and three in the bank and after a short conversation with the tellers proceeded to scoop money out of the cash drawers.  Surveillance photos show him doing this.  The assistant manager observed the robber as did a young woman, Yvonne Welch, who was standing next to him.  During the robbery, the robber wore a ski mask.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the robbery was proceeding, an officer of the bank, Mr. McGeorge, was on the phone talking to his wife.  He told her that the bank was being robbed and asked her to call the police.  Three other bank employees called the police to report a robbery in progress.  In at least one of the calls the robber was described as a tall, thin black man wearing a brown sweater and blue jeans with his face covered by a ski mask.  The Needham Police dispatcher radioed to all units in Needham that an armed robbery was in progress at the Needham Cooperative Bank involving a black male wearing a striped brown sweater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The robber left the bank on foot.  He was followed by the bank officer, McGeorge, through a parking lot leading to the street on which the taxi was parked.  The robber either fortuitously or purposely eluded McGeorge.  McGeorge, however, got close enough to see the robber's face, the ski mask having been removed.  About ten minutes after the robbery, the man who had called for the taxi, signalled the taxi which had been waiting for him.  He got into the taxi, told the driver that his wife was not coming with him, that he felt ill and was going to lie down on the back seat, which he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our exposition now brings us back to Robert's Bakery.  Within moments of the robbery, or during it, Needham Police Officer Arthur Douglas walked into the bakery.  He was known to the proprietor, who told him about his mother's call for a taxi for a man and the conversation between his mother and the man requesting the call.  As Douglas was going into the rear of the store for tea and a pastry, he heard on his portable radio that there was a robbery at the Needham Bank.  Douglas immediately ran to the bank, obtained a description of the robber and then ran back to the bakery to get a description of the man who had used the proprietor's mother to call a taxi.  Both descriptions dovetailed.  Douglas also learned that the taxi's destination was Newton Center.  Douglas then radioed to Newton Police Sergeant Albert Droney, gave him a description of the bank robber, and told him that the bank robber was in a red Veteran's cab headed to Newton Center.  Droney, in turn, called the Newton Police dispatcher, gave him a description of the bank robber, told him to give this information to the Newton Police and to tell them that the robber was in a red Veteran's taxicab heading down Highland Avenue in Needham towards Newton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newton Police Officer David Richard was sitting in his cruiser on Center Street in Newton, which is a continuation of Highland Avenue, when the Newton Police broadcast the robbery information.
