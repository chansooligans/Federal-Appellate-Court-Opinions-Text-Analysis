This   appeal   arises   from   a\n\nbankruptcy court adversary proceeding challenging Appellant Banco\n\nBilbao Vizcaya Argentaria's (BBVA) garnishment of funds in the bank\n\naccount of a corporation wholly owned by a Chapter 7 debtor and his\n\nwife. BBVA appeals the district court's affirmance of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt judgment in favor of the bankruptcy trustee, holding that\n\nBBVA's garnishment of funds was a preferential transfer of estate\n\nproperty avoidable under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).     BBVA seeks to argue\n\nin this court, under a number of theories, that ownership of the\n\ngarnished funds was properly vested in the bank and not the debtor.\n\nBecause BBVA neglected to squarely raise these arguments before the\n\nbankruptcy court, it has waived them and we therefore affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In 2004, BBVA brought suit in a commonwealth court\n\nagainst Manuel Enrique Net-Velázquez, his wife, and an associated\n\nbusiness partnership, resulting in an attachment in the amount of\n\n$300,000 on several parcels of real property owned by the couple.\n\nBBVA filed the attachment order in the Puerto Rico Registry of\n\nProperty in June 2005.\n\n          In August 2005, Net-Velázquez and his wife sold one of\n\nthe attached properties, a parcel located in Paseo de la Fuente,\n\nPuerto Rico. As it happened, the purchasers arranged for financing\n\nthrough BBVA.   Though BBVA ordered a title report prior to the\n\nclosing, the report omitted (for reasons that are in dispute and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fnot material here) BBVA's $300,000 attachment.           The personnel in\n\ncharge of the financing at BBVA were apparently unaware of the\n\nattachment and remained so until after the closing.\n\n           Upon sale of the parcel, BBVA issued a manager's check to\n\nNet-Velázquez and his wife in the amount of $354,373.30, the entire\n\nproceeds of the sale. Net-Velázquez, who admitted at trial that he\n\nwas aware of the attachment order, may or may not have been\n\nsurprised at the amount of the check and BBVA's failure to withhold\n\nany portion of the proceeds to satisfy its attachment, but he did\n\nnot raise the issue with BBVA.1\n\n           Net-Velázquez     and   his    wife   deposited   the    check   for\n\n$354,373.30 into a newly created bank account at a third-party\n\nbank.    The account was opened in the name of Code Inspector and\n\nManagement   Corp.   (Code   Inspector),     a   closely-held      corporation\n\ncreated by the couple in 2004.      Net-Velázquez and his wife were the\n\nsole shareholders and officers of Code Inspector, and each had full\n\ncontrol over the funds held in Code Inspector's bank account.\n\n           Two weeks after the closing, having belatedly become\n\naware of the failure to withhold a portion of the Paseo de la\n\nFuente sales proceeds to satisfy its attachment, BBVA garnished all\n\n\n     1\n      Net-Velázquez testified at trial that he had previously sold\nanother parcel subject to an attachment by BBVA, and in that\ntransaction BBVA and the purchaser had directly negotiated to\nreduce the amount of the attachment. Net-Velázquez said that when\nhe received the check for the full proceeds from the sale of the\nPaseo de la Fuente parcel, he believed that some similar\narrangement must have been reached.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof the available funds in the Code Inspector bank account.2      At the\n\ntime, the account contained $351,383.10. BBVA was unaware that the\n\naccount was maintained in Code Inspector's name, believing it to be\n\nNet-Velázquez's personal account.3\n\n           In December 2005, Net-Velázquez filed a petition for\n\nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.      The bankruptcy\n\nschedules accompanying Net-Velázquez's petition listed the Code\n\nInspector bank account as property of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           The bankruptcy trustee responsible for the Net-Velázquez\n\nestate   initiated   this   adversary   proceeding   against   BBVA   in\n\nSeptember 2006, asserting that the bank's garnishment of funds in\n\nthe Code Inspector bank account amounted to a preferential transfer\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The authority by which BBVA garnished the funds is not\nclearly disclosed by the record, but it appears that BBVA obtained,\non an expedited basis, an order from a local court.\n     3\n       A bank official testified that BBVA traced the account based\nupon the endorsed copy of the check returned to BBVA after deposit.\nBecause Net-Velázquez did not sign the check over to Code Inspector\nbut merely deposited the check into the corporate account, there\nwas no indication of the account's ownership.\n\n                                  -4-\n\funder 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).4         The trustee sought to recover the full\n\n$351,383.10 garnished by BBVA.5\n\n               The bankruptcy court held a bench trial in May 2008.\n\nAfter hearing testimony from Net-Velázquez and a representative of\n\nBBVA, the court ordered further briefing on the core issue that\n\nemerged      at     trial:   whether    Net-Velázquez   had    transferred   his\n\ninterest in the sales proceeds to Code Inspector by depositing them\n\nin Code Inspector's bank account, effectively removing those funds\n\nfrom the bankruptcy estate.              In an opinion and order issued on\n\nOctober 27, 2008, the court found that Net-Velázquez had retained\n\nownership of the funds in the Code Inspector account, and therefore\n\nthat       BBVA's    garnishment   of    funds   constituted    an   avoidable,\n\npreferential transfer of property from the estate.\n\n               BBVA appealed to the district court, see 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(a)(1), arguing that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding\n\n\n       4\n       Section 547(b) grants a bankruptcy trustee the power to\ninvalidate so-called \"preferential transfers\" of property from the\nbankruptcy estate to a creditor within a ninety-day period prior to\nthe filing of a bankruptcy petition. The rationale for allowing\nsuch transfers to be recovered is one of fairness, as a creditor\nwho receives property from the estate prior to bankruptcy may\nobtain, at the expense of other creditors, a greater share of\nestate property than the creditor would in bankruptcy.\n       5\n       For clarity's sake, we note that the amount garnished was\nless than the full amount of the check issued by BBVA to Net-\nVelázquez ($354,373.30), as the balance of the Code Inspector\naccount had declined to $351,383.10 at the time of the garnishment.\nThe garnishment exceeded, however, the amount to which BBVA was\nentitled by virtue of the attachment ($300,000); BBVA has conceded\nthat it had no right to the $51,383.10 garnished in excess of the\n$300,000 attachment.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat the funds in the Code Inspector bank account were owned by\n\nNet-Velázquez.   BBVA also raised several new defenses under Puerto\n\nRico's Negotiable Instruments Law, and argued as well that half of\n\nthe proceeds from the sale of the Paseo de la Fuente parcel\n\nbelonged to Net-Velázquez's wife and not to the estate.         The\n\ndistrict court affirmed, adopting the reasoning of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt and rejecting BBVA's newly asserted defenses as waived\n\nbecause BBVA had failed to raise them in the bankruptcy court.\n\nResponding to BBVA's remaining argument, the court held that the\n\nsale proceeds constituted community property of Net-Velázquez and\n\nhis spouse and thus were properly included in the bankruptcy\n\nestate.\n\n          This timely appeal followed.      We review a bankruptcy\n\ncourt's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law\n\nde novo, granting no special deference to the intermediate decision\n\nof the district court on appeal.   See Stornawaye Fin. Corp. v. Hill\n\n(In re Hill), 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                               III.\n\n          Under section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the trustee\n\nof an estate in bankruptcy may avoid \"'any transfer of an interest\n\nof the debtor in property' made (1) to a creditor, (2) on account\n\nof an antecedent debt, (3) while the debtor was insolvent, (4)\n\nduring the 90-day period preceding the filing of the petition,\n\nwhich (5) allowed such creditor to receive more than it would have\n\n\n                                -6-\n\funder Chapter 7.\"   Advanced Testing Techs., Inc. v. Desmond (In re\n\nComputer Eng'g Assocs.), 337 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\n11 U.S.C. § 547(b)).   The only contested element in this adversary\n\nproceeding is whether the garnished funds were \"an interest of the\n\ndebtor in property,\" that is, whether Net-Velázquez had a property\n\ninterest in the funds on deposit in Code Inspector's bank account\n\nwhen they were garnished by BBVA.\n\n          In the proceedings before the bankruptcy court, BBVA\n\nsought to establish that Net-Velázquez had no property interest in\n\nthe funds on the theory that the deposit into Code Inspector's bank\n\naccount converted the funds from personal property subject to\n\nbankruptcy procedures into corporate property.6    This contention\n\nplaced BBVA in the somewhat awkward position of arguing that it had\n\ngarnished funds from an entity that owed BBVA no debt.     Indeed,\n\nBBVA necessarily conceded that, if its theory of the case were\n\n\n\n     6\n       BBVA also argued that $300,000 of the $354,373.30 check\nissued to Net-Velázquez was \"earmarked\" for BBVA to satisfy its\nattachment and thus that the garnishment was not a preferential\ntransfer. The thrust of this \"earmarking\" argument is that the\ntransfer to a debtor of funds that are \"earmarked\" for a third\nparty does not vest ownership in the debtor; thus, the subsequent\ntransfer of those funds to the third party for which they are\nearmarked will not constitute a preferential transfer of \"an\ninterest of the debtor in property.\" See Collins v. Greater Atl.\nMortg. Corp. (In re Lazarus), 478 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2007). The\nbankruptcy court rejected this argument, citing the absence of any\nevidence that BBVA had \"earmarked\" the funds transferred to Net-\nVelázquez and his wife. The court found, to the contrary, that\nNet-Velázquez had left the closing \"cash-in-hand,\" with no\nrestrictions on the sales proceeds imposed by BBVA. BBVA has not\nchallenged this holding on appeal.\n\n                                -7-\n\fcorrect, Code Inspector might have a cause of action against BBVA.\n\nThe bankruptcy court rejected this ill-advised argument, and BBVA\n\ndoes not challenge the bankruptcy court's holding here.\n\n           In fact, BBVA has wholly abandoned on appeal each of the\n\narguments it made before the bankruptcy court.         Instead of arguing\n\nthat Net-Velázquez's deposit of the sales proceeds transferred\n\nownership to Code Inspector, as it did below, BBVA offers here an\n\narray of new legal arguments contending that a valid property\n\ninterest in the funds never even passed from BBVA to Net-Velázquez.\n\nFirst, BBVA raises a defense it styles \"payment by mistake,\"\n\ncontending that Net-Velázquez never obtained a right to the sale\n\nproceeds because the proceeds were transferred to him due to error\n\n-- namely, that BBVA failed to withhold funds sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe attachment because that encumbrance was erroneously omitted\n\nfrom the title report.     In support of this argument BBVA primarily\n\nrelies on Article 1795 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.7               See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 5121.\n\n           Second, BBVA offers a somewhat obscure argument under two\n\nsections   of   the   Puerto   Rico   Civil   Code   that   relate    to   the\n\nextinguishment of debt owed concurrently by two parties each to the\n\n\n     7\n       Article 1795 provides: \"If a thing is received when there\nwas no right to claim it and which, through an error, has been\nunduly delivered, there arises an obligation to restore the same.\"\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5121. BBVA also relies on section 418(b)\nof the Negotiable Instruments Law, which extends the foregoing\nprinciple to financial instruments paid or delivered by mistake.\nSee id. tit. 19, § 668.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fother, referred to by BBVA as \"set-off.\"     See   P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31, §§ 3221, 3228.   Under this theory, Net-Velázquez's obligation\n\nto BBVA was extinguished by operation of law upon the closing of\n\nthe sale of the Paseo de la Fuente parcel, at which moment BBVA and\n\nNet-Velázquez each owed a debt to the other -- Net-Velázquez for\n\nthe preexisting attachment, and BBVA, as the purchaser's financing\n\nagent, for the sale price.     The thrust of this argument, never\n\nfully elucidated by BBVA, appears to be that the sale proceeds were\n\nautomatically applied to the $300,000 attachment, and thus $300,000\n\nof the $354,373.30 check issued to Net-Velázquez and his wife\n\nrepresented an overpayment to which they had no legal entitlement.\n\n          Third, BBVA argues, under several provisions of Puerto\n\nRico's Negotiable Instruments Law, that BBVA had the right to\n\nrescind the manager's check issued to Net-Velázquez because Net-\n\nVelázquez did not take the instrument in good faith and therefore\n\ndid not qualify as a holder in due course.    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n19, §§ 451, 602, 605, 606.   Fourth, BBVA contends that the Paseo de\n\nla Fuente parcel and the proceeds from its sale were \"in custodia\n\nlegis\" (literally, in the custody of the law) at all points\n\nsubsequent to the issuance of the attachment order, barring Net-\n\nVelázquez from obtaining a legal interest in the sale proceeds.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f               As set forth below, we hold that BBVA has forfeited its\n\nchance to be heard on these arguments never presented to the\n\nbankruptcy court.8\n\n                                     IV.\n\n               The proposition is well established that, \"absent the\n\nmost       extraordinary   circumstances,      legal   theories    not   raised\n\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\n\non appeal.\"        Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union,\n\nLocal No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); see also Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 102 (1st\n\nCir.       2006)   (collecting   cases   and    describing   the     circuit's\n\n\"echolalic regularity\" in applying the waiver rule).                     Though\n\nsometimes severe in effect, this raise-or-waive rule \"is founded\n\nupon important considerations of fairness, judicial economy, and\n\npractical wisdom.\" Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d\n\n622, 627 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               It is undisputed that three of BBVA's arguments on appeal\n\nwere not raised in the bankruptcy court and are subject to waiver:\n\nthe \"set-off\" argument, the argument under Puerto Rico's Negotiable\n\nInstruments Law, and the characterization of the Paseo de la Fuente\n\n\n       8\n       The fact that portions of the arguments presented here were\nraised before the district court has no impact on our analysis.\nThe bankruptcy court acts as the trial court in bankruptcy\nproceedings. Thus, arguments must be presented in the bankruptcy\ncourt to be preserved; the district court acts solely as an\nintermediate appellate tribunal.    See Evergreen Credit Union v.\nWoodman (In re Woodman), 379 F.3d 1, 3 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fparcel as \"in custodia legis.\"        BBVA protests, however, that it\n\nproperly raised its fourth argument, the \"payment by mistake\"\n\ndefense, by including it in its answer to the adversary complaint.\n\nWe have closely examined BBVA's answer and find it, at best,\n\ndebatable whether \"payment by mistake\" was actually raised as a\n\ndefense.       As it turns out, however, we need not resolve the\n\nquestion because of BBVA's subsequent inattention to the defense.\n\n              A defense or legal theory may not be preserved by bare\n\nreference in a pleading if it is thereafter abandoned until,\n\nfreshly discovered on appeal, it is raised anew. Cf. DiMarco-Zappa\n\nv. Cabanillas, 238 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Simply noting an\n\nargument in passing without explanation is insufficient to avoid\n\nwaiver.\").     Save in exceptional cases, only those issues that are\n\nsquarely presented and litigated in the trial court may be raised\n\non appeal.     See Iverson, 452 F.3d at 102 (litigants must \"spell out\n\ntheir legal theories face-up and squarely in the trial court\" to\n\navoid waiver). Indeed, the Rules of Civil Procedure are structured\n\nto   winnow    the   issues   presented    by   the   pleadings   as   a   case\n\nprogresses, so that only relevant, non-frivolous theories and\n\ndefenses reach trial and are preserved for our review.            Rule 16 in\n\nparticular encourages the parties and the court, through the\n\npretrial conference process, to \"formulat[e] and simplify[] the\n\nissues, and eliminat[e] frivolous claims or defenses.\"                 Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 16(c)(2)(A).      Because the resulting pretrial order issued\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\funder Rule 16 is \"intended to shape the contours of the ensuing\n\ntrial by setting forth the legal theories upon which the parties\n\nintend to rely,\" Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1195\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), claims or defenses omitted from the pretrial order\n\nare waived, whether or not properly raised in the pleadings.            See\n\nRodríguez-García v. Miranda-Marín, 610 F.3d 756, 774 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).\n\n            Here, the record reflects that BBVA failed to pursue or\n\neven raise the \"payment by mistake\" defense at any point subsequent\n\nto its answer.      The parties' joint pretrial report contained no\n\nmention of BBVA's \"payment by mistake\" defense, identifying only\n\ntwo legal theories that BBVA intended to present at trial: first,\n\nthat the ownership of the sales proceeds passed to Code Inspector\n\nupon their deposit in its bank account, and second, that the sales\n\nproceeds    were   \"earmarked\"   for   BBVA   when   transferred   to   Net-\n\nVelázquez, and thus were outside the action of 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).9\n\nNo argument in support of a \"payment by mistake\" defense was made\n\nat the subsequent trial, nor was one included in BBVA's post-trial\n\nbriefing on ownership of the sales proceeds -- which focused solely\n\non the argument that Code Inspector was the rightful owner of the\n\nfunds.     Thus, even assuming BBVA did plead the substance of its\n\n\"payment by mistake\" defense in the answer, such defense was\n\nunambiguously waived for want of prosecution.\n\n\n     9\n         See supra note 6.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             BBVA's last-ditch argument seeks to cast this appeal as\n\nthe \"exceptional case\" warranting relief from waiver.                         It is true\n\nthat the rule of waiver for arguments not squarely presented below\n\n\"is    a   matter    of    discretion\"        and    \"admits      of     an   occasional\n\nexception.\"       Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627.            The bar, however, is high\n\nfor   such   an     exercise    of   discretion;       a    new    argument     will   be\n\nconsidered on appeal only when \"the equities heavily preponderate\n\nin favor of such a step.\"            Id.\n\n             We have applied various criteria to aid in identifying\n\nthe exceptional case where relief from waiver is appropriate.                          A\n\nnonexhaustive       list   of   factors      relevant       to    this    determination\n\nincludes: (1) whether the litigant's failure to raise the issue has\n\ndeprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding, or whether the\n\nissue was of a purely legal nature; (2) whether the omitted\n\nargument raises an issue of constitutional magnitude; (3) whether\n\nthe argument was highly persuasive and failure to reach it would\n\nthreaten a miscarriage of justice; (4) whether considering the\n\nissue would cause prejudice or inequity to the adverse party; (5)\n\nwhether the failure to raise the issue was inadvertent and provided\n\nno    tactical    advantage;     and       (6)    whether   the    issue      implicates\n\n\"matters of great public moment,\" id. at 628.                          See Montalvo v.\n\nGonzalez-Amparo, 587 F.3d 43, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2009); Harwood, 69\n\nF.3d at 627-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f             Of those criteria, a few seem to weigh slightly in BBVA's\n\nfavor here. First, BBVA's newly raised arguments are largely legal\n\nin nature, and thus BBVA's failure to raise them below does not\n\nappear to have substantially \"deprived the court of appeals of\n\nuseful factfinding.\"       Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627.          Second, allowance\n\nof the arguments would present \"no special prejudice or inequity to\n\nthe plaintiffs,\" other than possibly to further protract litigation\n\nthat has now drawn on for over four years.           Id. at 628.      Third, the\n\nomission     of     the   arguments     below     appears     attributable     to\n\ninadvertence rather than a play for tactical advantage by BBVA.\n\nSee id.\n\n             On the other hand, both the number and diversity of legal\n\ntheories pressed by BBVA on appeal mark these arguments as the\n\nprecise species our waiver rule is designed to deter: transparent\n\nafterthoughts and alternative defenses burnished for appeal after\n\nthe defendant's primary arguments failed at trial. It is typically\n\nonly   in   cases    involving   issues      of   \"great    public   moment\"   or\n\n\"constitutional magnitude\" that we are inclined to disregard our\n\nwaiver rule.       See id. at 628.      There can be no question that the\n\nmiscellaneous issues raised in BBVA's appeal are of no such lofty\n\nstature.\n\n             Moreover, BBVA has other remedies available, as it filed\n\na third-party complaint for contribution against the title search\n\ncompany     that    prepared   the    erroneous    title    report.      If    the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcontribution claim fails, BBVA will simply end up on equal footing\n\nwith other unsecured creditors of the Net-Velázquez estate, and may\n\nyet recover some portion of the $300,000 owed by Net-Velázquez.\n\nWhile we do not suggest that there is nothing at stake for BBVA\n\nhere,    the    consequences   of   foreclosing   BBVA's   tardily   raised\n\narguments fall far short of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n               As noted, we will only consider new arguments on appeal\n\nwhere the \"equities heavily preponderate in favor of such a step.\"\n\nHarwood, 69 F.3d at 627.            Having identified and weighed the\n\ncriteria we deem most relevant to BBVA's request to have its\n\narguments heard for the first time on appeal, we conclude that the\n\nequities do not heavily preponderate in favor of allowing these new\n\narguments.       Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f",

This   appeal   arises   from   a\n\nbankruptcy court adversary proceeding challenging Appellant Banco\n\nBilbao Vizcaya Argentaria's (BBVA) garnishment of funds in the bank\n\naccount of a corporation wholly owned by a Chapter 7 debtor and his\n\nwife. BBVA appeals the district court's affirmance of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt judgment in favor of the bankruptcy trustee, holding that\n\nBBVA's garnishment of funds was a preferential transfer of estate\n\nproperty avoidable under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).     BBVA seeks to argue\n\nin this court, under a number of theories, that ownership of the\n\ngarnished funds was properly vested in the bank and not the debtor.\n\nBecause BBVA neglected to squarely raise these arguments before the\n\nbankruptcy court, it has waived them and we therefore affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In 2004, BBVA brought suit in a commonwealth court\n\nagainst Manuel Enrique Net-Velázquez, his wife, and an associated\n\nbusiness partnership, resulting in an attachment in the amount of\n\n$300,000 on several parcels of real property owned by the couple.\n\nBBVA filed the attachment order in the Puerto Rico Registry of\n\nProperty in June 2005.\n\n          In August 2005, Net-Velázquez and his wife sold one of\n\nthe attached properties, a parcel located in Paseo de la Fuente,\n\nPuerto Rico. As it happened, the purchasers arranged for financing\n\nthrough BBVA.   Though BBVA ordered a title report prior to the\n\nclosing, the report omitted (for reasons that are in dispute and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fnot material here) BBVA's $300,000 attachment.           The personnel in\n\ncharge of the financing at BBVA were apparently unaware of the\n\nattachment and remained so until after the closing.\n\n           Upon sale of the parcel, BBVA issued a manager's check to\n\nNet-Velázquez and his wife in the amount of $354,373.30, the entire\n\nproceeds of the sale. Net-Velázquez, who admitted at trial that he\n\nwas aware of the attachment order, may or may not have been\n\nsurprised at the amount of the check and BBVA's failure to withhold\n\nany portion of the proceeds to satisfy its attachment, but he did\n\nnot raise the issue with BBVA.1\n\n           Net-Velázquez     and   his    wife   deposited   the    check   for\n\n$354,373.30 into a newly created bank account at a third-party\n\nbank.    The account was opened in the name of Code Inspector and\n\nManagement   Corp.   (Code   Inspector),     a   closely-held      corporation\n\ncreated by the couple in 2004.      Net-Velázquez and his wife were the\n\nsole shareholders and officers of Code Inspector, and each had full\n\ncontrol over the funds held in Code Inspector's bank account.\n\n           Two weeks after the closing, having belatedly become\n\naware of the failure to withhold a portion of the Paseo de la\n\nFuente sales proceeds to satisfy its attachment, BBVA garnished all\n\n\n     1\n      Net-Velázquez testified at trial that he had previously sold\nanother parcel subject to an attachment by BBVA, and in that\ntransaction BBVA and the purchaser had directly negotiated to\nreduce the amount of the attachment. Net-Velázquez said that when\nhe received the check for the full proceeds from the sale of the\nPaseo de la Fuente parcel, he believed that some similar\narrangement must have been reached.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof the available funds in the Code Inspector bank account.2      At the\n\ntime, the account contained $351,383.10. BBVA was unaware that the\n\naccount was maintained in Code Inspector's name, believing it to be\n\nNet-Velázquez's personal account.3\n\n           In December 2005, Net-Velázquez filed a petition for\n\nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.      The bankruptcy\n\nschedules accompanying Net-Velázquez's petition listed the Code\n\nInspector bank account as property of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           The bankruptcy trustee responsible for the Net-Velázquez\n\nestate   initiated   this   adversary   proceeding   against   BBVA   in\n\nSeptember 2006, asserting that the bank's garnishment of funds in\n\nthe Code Inspector bank account amounted to a preferential transfer\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The authority by which BBVA garnished the funds is not\nclearly disclosed by the record, but it appears that BBVA obtained,\non an expedited basis, an order from a local court.\n     3\n       A bank official testified that BBVA traced the account based\nupon the endorsed copy of the check returned to BBVA after deposit.\nBecause Net-Velázquez did not sign the check over to Code Inspector\nbut merely deposited the check into the corporate account, there\nwas no indication of the account's ownership.\n\n                                  -4-\n\funder 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).4         The trustee sought to recover the full\n\n$351,383.10 garnished by BBVA.5\n\n               The bankruptcy court held a bench trial in May 2008.\n\nAfter hearing testimony from Net-Velázquez and a representative of\n\nBBVA, the court ordered further briefing on the core issue that\n\nemerged      at     trial:   whether    Net-Velázquez   had    transferred   his\n\ninterest in the sales proceeds to Code Inspector by depositing them\n\nin Code Inspector's bank account, effectively removing those funds\n\nfrom the bankruptcy estate.              In an opinion and order issued on\n\nOctober 27, 2008, the court found that Net-Velázquez had retained\n\nownership of the funds in the Code Inspector account, and therefore\n\nthat       BBVA's    garnishment   of    funds   constituted    an   avoidable,\n\npreferential transfer of property from the estate.\n\n               BBVA appealed to the district court, see 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(a)(1), arguing that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding\n\n\n       4\n       Section 547(b) grants a bankruptcy trustee the power to\ninvalidate so-called \"preferential transfers\" of property from the\nbankruptcy estate to a creditor within a ninety-day period prior to\nthe filing of a bankruptcy petition. The rationale for allowing\nsuch transfers to be recovered is one of fairness, as a creditor\nwho receives property from the estate prior to bankruptcy may\nobtain, at the expense of other creditors, a greater share of\nestate property than the creditor would in bankruptcy.\n       5\n       For clarity's sake, we note that the amount garnished was\nless than the full amount of the check issued by BBVA to Net-\nVelázquez ($354,373.30), as the balance of the Code Inspector\naccount had declined to $351,383.10 at the time of the garnishment.\nThe garnishment exceeded, however, the amount to which BBVA was\nentitled by virtue of the attachment ($300,000); BBVA has conceded\nthat it had no right to the $51,383.10 garnished in excess of the\n$300,000 attachment.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat the funds in the Code Inspector bank account were owned by\n\nNet-Velázquez.   BBVA also raised several new defenses under Puerto\n\nRico's Negotiable Instruments Law, and argued as well that half of\n\nthe proceeds from the sale of the Paseo de la Fuente parcel\n\nbelonged to Net-Velázquez's wife and not to the estate.         The\n\ndistrict court affirmed, adopting the reasoning of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt and rejecting BBVA's newly asserted defenses as waived\n\nbecause BBVA had failed to raise them in the bankruptcy court.\n\nResponding to BBVA's remaining argument, the court held that the\n\nsale proceeds constituted community property of Net-Velázquez and\n\nhis spouse and thus were properly included in the bankruptcy\n\nestate.\n\n          This timely appeal followed.      We review a bankruptcy\n\ncourt's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law\n\nde novo, granting no special deference to the intermediate decision\n\nof the district court on appeal.

The only contested element in this adversary\n\nproceeding is whether the garnished funds were \"an interest of the\n\ndebtor in property,\" that is, whether Net-Velázquez had a property\n\ninterest in the funds on deposit in Code Inspector's bank account\n\nwhen they were garnished by BBVA.\n\n          In the proceedings before the bankruptcy court, BBVA\n\nsought to establish that Net-Velázquez had no property interest in\n\nthe funds on the theory that the deposit into Code Inspector's bank\n\naccount converted the funds from personal property subject to\n\nbankruptcy procedures into corporate property.6    This contention\n\nplaced BBVA in the somewhat awkward position of arguing that it had\n\ngarnished funds from an entity that owed BBVA no debt.     Indeed,\n\nBBVA necessarily conceded that, if its theory of the case were\n\n\n\n     6\n       BBVA also argued that $300,000 of the $354,373.30 check\nissued to Net-Velázquez was \"earmarked\" for BBVA to satisfy its\nattachment and thus that the garnishment was not a preferential\ntransfer. The thrust of this \"earmarking\" argument is that the\ntransfer to a debtor of funds that are \"earmarked\" for a third\nparty does not vest ownership in the debtor; thus, the subsequent\ntransfer of those funds to the third party for which they are\nearmarked will not constitute a preferential transfer of \"an\ninterest of the debtor in property.\" See Collins v. Greater Atl.\nMortg. Corp. (In re Lazarus), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2007). The\nbankruptcy court rejected this argument, citing the absence of any\nevidence that BBVA had \"earmarked\" the funds transferred to Net-\nVelázquez and his wife. The court found, to the contrary, that\nNet-Velázquez had left the closing \"cash-in-hand,\" with no\nrestrictions on the sales proceeds imposed by BBVA. BBVA has not\nchallenged this holding on appeal.\n\n                                -7-\n\fcorrect, Code Inspector might have a cause of action against BBVA.\n\nThe bankruptcy court rejected this ill-advised argument, and BBVA\n\ndoes not challenge the bankruptcy court's holding here.\n\n           In fact, BBVA has wholly abandoned on appeal each of the\n\narguments it made before the bankruptcy court.         Instead of arguing\n\nthat Net-Velázquez's deposit of the sales proceeds transferred\n\nownership to Code Inspector, as it did below, BBVA offers here an\n\narray of new legal arguments contending that a valid property\n\ninterest in the funds never even passed from BBVA to Net-Velázquez.\n\nFirst, BBVA raises a defense it styles \"payment by mistake,\"\n\ncontending that Net-Velázquez never obtained a right to the sale\n\nproceeds because the proceeds were transferred to him due to error\n\n-- namely, that BBVA failed to withhold funds sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe attachment because that encumbrance was erroneously omitted\n\nfrom the title report.     In support of this argument BBVA primarily\n\nrelies on Article 1795 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.7               See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 5121.\n\n           Second, BBVA offers a somewhat obscure argument under two\n\nsections   of   the   Puerto   Rico   Civil   Code   that   relate    to   the\n\nextinguishment of debt owed concurrently by two parties each to the\n\n\n     7\n       Article 1795 provides: \"If a thing is received when there\nwas no right to claim it and which, through an error, has been\nunduly delivered, there arises an obligation to restore the same.\"\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5121. BBVA also relies on section 418(b)\nof the Negotiable Instruments Law, which extends the foregoing\nprinciple to financial instruments paid or delivered by mistake.\nSee id. tit. 19, § 668.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fother, referred to by BBVA as \"set-off.\"     See   P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31, §§ 3221, 3228.   Under this theory, Net-Velázquez's obligation\n\nto BBVA was extinguished by operation of law upon the closing of\n\nthe sale of the Paseo de la Fuente parcel, at which moment BBVA and\n\nNet-Velázquez each owed a debt to the other -- Net-Velázquez for\n\nthe preexisting attachment, and BBVA, as the purchaser's financing\n\nagent, for the sale price.     The thrust of this argument, never\n\nfully elucidated by BBVA, appears to be that the sale proceeds were\n\nautomatically applied to the $300,000 attachment, and thus $300,000\n\nof the $354,373.30 check issued to Net-Velázquez and his wife\n\nrepresented an overpayment to which they had no legal entitlement.\n\n          Third, BBVA argues, under several provisions of Puerto\n\nRico's Negotiable Instruments Law, that BBVA had the right to\n\nrescind the manager's check issued to Net-Velázquez because Net-\n\nVelázquez did not take the instrument in good faith and therefore\n\ndid not qualify as a holder in due course.    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n19, §§ 451, 602, 605, 606.   Fourth, BBVA contends that the Paseo de\n\nla Fuente parcel and the proceeds from its sale were \"in custodia\n\nlegis\" (literally, in the custody of the law) at all points\n\nsubsequent to the issuance of the attachment order, barring Net-\n\nVelázquez from obtaining a legal interest in the sale proceeds.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f               As set forth below, we hold that BBVA has forfeited its\n\nchance to be heard on these arguments never presented to the\n\nbankruptcy court.8\n\n                                     IV.\n\n               The proposition is well established that, \"absent the\n\nmost       extraordinary   circumstances,      legal   theories    not   raised\n\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\n\non appeal.\"        Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union,\n\nLocal No. 59 v.

Save in exceptional cases, only those issues that are\n\nsquarely presented and litigated in the trial court may be raised\n\non appeal.     See Iverson, 452 F.3d at 102 (litigants must \"spell out\n\ntheir legal theories face-up and squarely in the trial court\" to\n\navoid waiver). Indeed, the Rules of Civil Procedure are structured\n\nto   winnow    the   issues   presented    by   the   pleadings   as   a   case\n\nprogresses, so that only relevant, non-frivolous theories and\n\ndefenses reach trial and are preserved for our review.

The parties' joint pretrial report contained no\n\nmention of BBVA's \"payment by mistake\" defense, identifying only\n\ntwo legal theories that BBVA intended to present at trial: first,\n\nthat the ownership of the sales proceeds passed to Code Inspector\n\nupon their deposit in its bank account, and second, that the sales\n\nproceeds    were   \"earmarked\"   for   BBVA   when   transferred   to   Net-\n\nVelázquez, and thus were outside the action of 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).9\n\nNo argument in support of a \"payment by mistake\" defense was made\n\nat the subsequent trial, nor was one included in BBVA's post-trial\n\nbriefing on ownership of the sales proceeds -- which focused solely\n\non the argument that Code Inspector was the rightful owner of the\n\nfunds.     Thus, even assuming BBVA did plead the substance of its\n\n\"payment by mistake\" defense in the answer, such defense was\n\nunambiguously waived for want of prosecution.\n\n\n     9\n         See supra note 6.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             BBVA's last-ditch argument seeks to cast this appeal as\n\nthe \"exceptional case\" warranting relief from waiver.                         It is true\n\nthat the rule of waiver for arguments not squarely presented below\n\n\"is    a   matter    of    discretion\"        and    \"admits      of     an   occasional\n\nexception.\"       Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627.            The bar, however, is high\n\nfor   such   an     exercise    of   discretion;       a    new    argument     will   be\n\nconsidered on appeal only when \"the equities heavily preponderate\n\nin favor of such a step.\"            Id.\n\n             We have applied various criteria to aid in identifying\n\nthe exceptional case where relief from waiver is appropriate.                          A\n\nnonexhaustive       list   of   factors      relevant       to    this    determination\n\nincludes: (1) whether the litigant's failure to raise the issue has\n\ndeprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding, or whether the\n\nissue was of a purely legal nature; (2) whether the omitted\n\nargument raises an issue of constitutional magnitude; (3) whether\n\nthe argument was highly persuasive and failure to reach it would\n\nthreaten a miscarriage of justice; (4) whether considering the\n\nissue would cause prejudice or inequity to the adverse party; (5)\n\nwhether the failure to raise the issue was inadvertent and provided\n\nno    tactical    advantage;     and       (6)    whether   the    issue      implicates\n\n\"matters of great public moment,\" id. at 628.

First, BBVA's newly raised arguments are largely legal\n\nin nature, and thus BBVA's failure to raise them below does not\n\nappear to have substantially \"deprived the court of appeals of\n\nuseful factfinding.\"       Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627.          Second, allowance\n\nof the arguments would present \"no special prejudice or inequity to\n\nthe plaintiffs,\" other than possibly to further protract litigation\n\nthat has now drawn on for over four years.           Id. at 628.      Third, the\n\nomission     of     the   arguments     below     appears     attributable     to\n\ninadvertence rather than a play for tactical advantage by BBVA.\n\nSee id.\n\n             On the other hand, both the number and diversity of legal\n\ntheories pressed by BBVA on appeal mark these arguments as the\n\nprecise species our waiver rule is designed to deter: transparent\n\nafterthoughts and alternative defenses burnished for appeal after\n\nthe defendant's primary arguments failed at trial. It is typically\n\nonly   in   cases    involving   issues      of   \"great    public   moment\"   or\n\n\"constitutional magnitude\" that we are inclined to disregard our\n\nwaiver rule.       See id. at 628.      There can be no question that the\n\nmiscellaneous issues raised in BBVA's appeal are of no such lofty\n\nstature.\n\n             Moreover, BBVA has other remedies available, as it filed\n\na third-party complaint for contribution against the title search\n\ncompany     that    prepared   the    erroneous    title    report.      If    the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcontribution claim fails, BBVA will simply end up on equal footing\n\nwith other unsecured creditors of the Net-Velázquez estate, and may\n\nyet recover some portion of the $300,000 owed by Net-Velázquez.\n\nWhile we do not suggest that there is nothing at stake for BBVA\n\nhere,    the    consequences   of   foreclosing   BBVA's   tardily   raised\n\narguments fall far short of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n               As noted, we will only consider new arguments on appeal\n\nwhere the \"equities heavily preponderate in favor of such a step.\"\n\nHarwood, 69 F.3d at 627.            Having identified and weighed the\n\ncriteria we deem most relevant to BBVA's request to have its\n\narguments heard for the first time on appeal, we conclude that the\n\nequities do not heavily preponderate in favor of allowing these new\n\narguments.       Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f</pre>",
