Luis Duque Rodriguez appeals\n                             \n\nfrom a  drug conspiracy  conviction, 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1),\n\nand ten year prison  sentence.  After reading the  record in\n\nthe case, we find his arguments unconvincing, and we  affirm\n\nthe district court.\n\n          The  record  would permit  the  jury  to find  the\n\nfollowing facts:\n\n          1.   In  1990  the FBI  caught  a major  Colombian\n               cocaine  dealer, Pedro Alvarez, who agreed to\n               help the FBI catch others.\n\n          2.   Alvarez,  on  FBI  instructions,   ordered  a\n               shipment of about half  a ton of cocaine from\n               Colombia.   The  Colombian dealers  sent  the\n               cocaine to Massachusetts.   They also  sent a\n               fax  to  what (in  fact)  was  an FBI  office\n               saying,  among  other   things,  that   about\n               fifteen  pounds  of   the  cocaine  was   for\n               \"Victor,\"  whom Alvarez  identified as  a New\n               York dealer, Luis Zapata.\n\n          3.   On  June 6,  1991, Alvarez told  Zapata about\n               the shipment.  \n\n          4.   Four days later, Zapata hired Duque  to drive\n               him to Massachusetts in Duque's van.  The two\n               spent the night  of June 10  at a Fall  River\n               hotel,  where Antonio  Dillon,  an FBI  agent\n               (masquerading  as  Alvarez's  associate)  had\n               reserved them a room.  On June 11, Zapata met\n               Dillon and  told him  that he had  \"brought a\n               friend  with him  to help  him take  the load\n               back to New York.\"  \n\n          5.   On the morning of June 12, Dillon, Zapata and\n               Duque met  at the hotel.   Dillon spoke about\n               other  shipments and  the need  for security.\n               Duque  agreed  that  security was  important.\n\n               Dillon  led Zapata and Duque (in Duque's van)\n               to a warehouse.  \n\n               a)   A  film of  the events,  supplemented by\n                    testimony  of two  FBI  agents who  were\n                    present, shows that  Duque's van  backed\n                    into the warehouse, Duque got out of the\n                    van,  watched two men open a white sack,\n                    looked  at  bricks  of  cocaine  inside,\n                    waited   while  Zapata   loaded  several\n                    cocaine bricks into storage compartments\n                    built into the rear of the van, took two\n                    bricks himself from the bag and put them\n                    in a compartment  under the  passenger's\n                    seat, and shut the van door. \n\n               b)   Dillon  testified   that,  during  these\n                    events,  Duque  said, \"We've  been using\n                    the van; however,  I need to  . . .  pay\n                    for a secret . . . compartment to be put\n                    into   the   van    which   will    hold\n                    approximately fifty . . . .\"\n\n          6.   The FBI then arrested Duque and Zapata.\n\n          Duque makes four arguments on this appeal.  First,\n\nhe says that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to\n\nconclude that he knew he was dealing with drugs.  He  points\n\nto  his own testimony that  Zapata paid him  only $1,000 for\n\nthe  trip and to a  legal rule that  prohibits conviction on\n\nthe basis of an uncorroborated confession with nothing more.\n\nWong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488-89 (1963).  The\n                         \n\njury,  however, was  free  to disbelieve  Duque's  testimony\n\nabout his state of mind.   It could easily believe  that the\n\namount of payment, even if low, was not sufficient to offset\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nother  evidence of  Duque's  knowing involvement.   And  the\n\nrecord contained much corroboration  -- a film showing Duque\n\nloading  cocaine, for example -- that makes the rule of Wong\n                                                            \n\nSun inapplicable.   Cf. United States  v. Guerrero-Guerrero,\n                                                           \n\n776  F.2d  1071,  1075  (1st Cir.  1985)  (jury  could  have\n\nconcluded  beyond reasonable doubt  that members  of sailing\n\nvessel's crew knew that vessel contained marijuana, in light\n\nof reasonable inference that smugglers were counting on crew\n\nto  unload hundreds  of  heavy drug-laden  sacks on  board),\n\ncert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029 (1986).\n            \n\n          Second, Duque asks us  to set aside his conviction\n\non the ground  that the  government behaved  \"outrageously.\"\n\nUnited States  v. Russell,  411  U.S. 423  (1973); see  also\n                                                            \n\nHampton  v.  United  States,  425 U.S.  484,  491-95  (1976)\n                           \n\n(Powell, J.,  concurring);  id.  at  495-500  (Brennan,  J.,\n                               \n\ndissenting).   Duque should  have raised this  matter before\n\ntrial.   Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(1),  12(f).   But,  in any\n\nevent,  the argument  is not  substantial.  Duque  rests his\n\nargument upon his  claim that the  government here gave  its\n\ninformer, Pedro  Alvarez, more  than five hundred  pounds of\n\ncocaine.   Duque  points to  an FBI  agent's testimony  that\n\n275.5 kilograms  were earmarked for Alvarez  himself \"as his\n\nprofit for assisting in the operation,\" or as \"a fee for . .\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n. arranging  the transport, importation of  the cocaine into\n\nthe  United States.\"    In context,  however, this testimony\n\nrefers to the fact that the Colombian dealers, thinking that\n\nAlvarez was a drug  broker, told Alvarez that he  could keep\n\nthis amount as a broker's commission.  Nothing in the record\n\nsuggests  that  the  government  intended  to   let  Alvarez\n\nactually  keep the drugs  or that he did  so.  Thus, Duque's\n\nargument comes down to a claim that the government was wrong\n\nto use the  drugs in a \"sting\" operation.   This circuit has\n\nmade  clear, however, that a drug \"sting\" does not amount to\n\n\"outrageous\" government  conduct.  United States  v. Panitz,\n                                                           \n\n907  F.2d  1267, 1273  (1st  Cir.  1990); United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\nPorter, 764 F.2d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1985).  \n      \n\n          Third, Duque  points out that  the district  court\n\nsentenced him on the basis of nine kilograms of cocaine.  He\n\nsays that the court  should have sentenced him on  the basis\n\nof less than five kilograms.  The court, however, could have\n\nbelieved  that he  intended to  transport nine  kilograms of\n\ncocaine, for Duque saw nine kilograms  being loaded into his\n\nvan.  \n\n          Fourth, Duque  argues that the  court should  have\n\nsentenced  him  as a  \"minimal,\"  rather than  as  a \"minor\"\n\nparticipant.   See U.S.S.G.  3B1.2.   On our  view, however,\n                  \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthe  court could have believed that Duque's role as a driver\n\nwas more significant  than that  of a minor  \"courier\" in  a\n\nsmall  operation,  id.  at    3B1.2,  comment  (nn.1  &amp;  2),\n                      \n\nparticularly   since  his   van  seemed   to  have   special\n\ncompartments that  he said  he intended  to modify  to carry\n\nlarger shipments.  We recognize that his comparatively small\n\ncompensation ($1,000) argues in  favor of a greater downward\n\nadjustment, but the size of  the operation argues the  other\n\nway.   These matters are  primarily for the  district court,\n\nUnited States v.  Figueroa, 976  F.2d 1446,  1461 (1st  Cir.\n                          \n\n1992),  cert. denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3584 (U.S. 1993).  And, we\n                    \n\ncan  find no  legal error  in that  court's exercise  of its\n\njudgment.  Id. at 1462 (rejecting claim that district  court\n              \n\nshould  have found  defendant  to be  \"minimal\" participant,\n\nrather than \"minor\" one); United States v. Tabares, 951 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n405,  410 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (district  court's determination\n\nthat  defendant  was  a   \"minor\"  participant  rather  than\n\n\"minimal\"  one   not  clearly  erroneous,  where   based  on\n\nreasonable inferences drawn from undisputed facts).\n\n          We  find the appellant's  remaining issues without\n\nmerit.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 17\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir.  1990) (issues adverted to  in perfunctory manner,\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nunaccompanied by effort  at developed argumentation,  deemed\n\nwaived).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n",

Dillon spoke about\n               other  shipments and  the need  for security.\n               Duque  agreed  that  security was  important.\n\n               Dillon  led Zapata and Duque (in Duque's van)\n               to a warehouse.  \n\n               a)   A  film of  the events,  supplemented by\n                    testimony  of two  FBI  agents who  were\n                    present, shows that  Duque's van  backed\n                    into the warehouse, Duque got out of the\n                    van,  watched two men open a white sack,\n                    looked  at  bricks  of  cocaine  inside,\n                    waited   while  Zapata   loaded  several\n                    cocaine bricks into storage compartments\n                    built into the rear of the van, took two\n                    bricks himself from the bag and put them\n                    in a compartment  under the  passenger's\n                    seat, and shut the van door. \n\n               b)   Dillon  testified   that,  during  these\n                    events,  Duque  said, \"We've  been using\n                    the van; however,  I need to  . . .  pay\n                    for a secret . . . compartment to be put\n                    into   the   van    which   will    hold\n                    approximately fifty . . . .\"\n\n          6.   The FBI then arrested Duque and Zapata.\n\n          Duque makes four arguments on this appeal.  First,\n\nhe says that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to\n\nconclude that he knew he was dealing with drugs.  He  points\n\nto  his own testimony that  Zapata paid him  only $1,000 for\n\nthe  trip and to a  legal rule that  prohibits conviction on\n\nthe basis of an uncorroborated confession with nothing more.\n\nWong Sun v.

The\n                         \n\njury,  however, was  free  to disbelieve  Duque's  testimony\n\nabout his state of mind.

Duque should  have raised this  matter before\n\ntrial.   Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(1),  12(f).   But,  in any\n\nevent,  the argument  is not  substantial.  Duque  rests his\n\nargument upon his  claim that the  government here gave  its\n\ninformer, Pedro  Alvarez, more  than five hundred  pounds of\n\ncocaine.   Duque  points to  an FBI  agent's testimony  that\n\n275.5 kilograms  were earmarked for Alvarez  himself \"as his\n\nprofit for assisting in the operation,\" or as \"a fee for . .\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n. arranging  the transport, importation of  the cocaine into\n\nthe  United States.\"    In context,  however, this testimony\n\nrefers to the fact that the Colombian dealers, thinking that\n\nAlvarez was a drug  broker, told Alvarez that he  could keep\n\nthis amount as a broker's commission.  Nothing in the record\n\nsuggests  that  the  government  intended  to   let  Alvarez\n\nactually  keep the drugs  or that he did  so.  Thus, Duque's\n\nargument comes down to a claim that the government was wrong\n\nto use the  drugs in a \"sting\" operation.   This circuit has\n\nmade  clear, however, that a drug \"sting\" does not amount to\n\n\"outrageous\" government  conduct.  United States  v.

He\n\nsays that the court  should have sentenced him on  the basis\n\nof less than five kilograms.  The court, however, could have\n\nbelieved  that he  intended to  transport nine  kilograms of\n\ncocaine, for Duque saw nine kilograms  being loaded into his\n\nvan.  \n\n          Fourth, Duque  argues that the  court should  have\n\nsentenced  him  as a  \"minimal,\"  rather than  as  a \"minor\"\n\nparticipant.   See U.S.S.G.  3B1.2.   On our  view, however,\n                  \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthe  court could have believed that Duque's role as a driver\n\nwas more significant  than that  of a minor  \"courier\" in  a\n\nsmall  operation,  id.  at    3B1.2,  comment  (nn.1  &amp;  2),\n                      \n\nparticularly   since  his   van  seemed   to  have   special\n\ncompartments that  he said  he intended  to modify  to carry\n\nlarger shipments.  We recognize that his comparatively small\n\ncompensation ($1,000) argues in  favor of a greater downward\n\nadjustment, but the size of  the operation argues the  other\n\nway.
