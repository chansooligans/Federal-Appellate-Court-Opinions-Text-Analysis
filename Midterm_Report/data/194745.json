This dispute  involves the\n                                   \n\nownership of a house in  Camuy, Puerto Rico.  After a  jury found\n\nfor appellees, the district court  denied appellants' alternative\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law and  for a new trial.  We\n\naffirm the district court's judgment.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The  parties  agree  to  the following  facts  for  the\n\npurposes  of   this  appeal.    Appellants,   Mateo  and  Antonia\n\nOlavarr a, are Puerto Rican retirees living in Miami.  Appellees,\n\nLuis Felipe Rivera and Noem  Alvarez, are appellants' grandnephew\n\nand grandniece.  In 1985,  appellants visited appellees in Puerto\n\nRico.   Luis and  Noem  were married  with four  children at  the\n\ntime, but have  since divorced.   Troubled by   Luis'  deplorable\n\nliving conditions, Mateo offered to buy land to  build a home for\n\nLuis and his family.  Soon after,  Luis found  a parcel  of land,\n\nand Mateo bought  it for $18,000.   Mateo took  title in his  own\n\nname to prevent Luis from selling it.\n\n          Learning  on a  later  visit that  Luis  had not  begun\n\nconstruction of the  house, Mateo  opened an account  at a  local\n\nbank with $12,500,  to help him  get started.   Mateo later  made\n\nadditional deposits.  Antonia sent Mateo $30,000 from their joint\n\naccount  for  one of  these  deposits.   Ultimately,  the account\n\nreached the sum of $51,000, which Luis used to build the home.\n\n          When Mateo  later learned that Luis  planned to divorce\n\nNoem , he attempted to sell the house.  Luis and  Noem  then sued\n\nMateo  and Antonia, claiming ownership.   At trial,  a jury found\n\n                               -2-\n\nfor  appellees,  and the  court  denied  appellants' motions  for\n\njudgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          As always, we must afford the jury verdict considerable\n\ndeference.    We will  overturn a  district  court's denial  of a\n\nmotion for judgment as  a matter of  law only if  we find that  a\n\nrational  jury could reach only  one conclusion.   See Pearson v.\n                                                              \n\nJohn Hancock  Mut. Life  Ins. Co.,  979 F.2d  254, 255  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992).   Similarly, we review a district  court's denial of a new\n\ntrial only for abuse of discretion.  PH Group Ltd.  v. Birch, 985\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Puerto Rico  is a civil  law jurisdiction,  ruled by  a\n\ncivil code.  Pursuant  to its provisions in  P.R. Laws Ann.  tit.\n\n31,    3672  (1991),  no  spouse may  donate  community  property\n\nwithout  the written  consent  of the  other  spouse, other  than\n\nproperty meant for personal or family  use that individuals would\n\ncommonly transfer  given their economic situation.   Section 3672\n\nprovides in relevant part:\n\n            Notwithstanding [exceptions not  relevant\n            here],  neither of  the  two spouses  may\n                           \n            donate,   alienate   or   bind    for   a\n            consideration   the   personal  or   real\n            property   of   the  community   property\n            without the written consent of  the other\n                                       \n            spouse, excepting things for  personal or\n            family use in  accordance with the social\n            or economic standing of both spouses.\n\n            Any disposal or  administration act  made\n            with  respect to said  property by either\n                                                     \n            of  the spouses in  violation of this and\n            any other section of this title shall not\n            affect the other spouse or his heirs.\n\n                               -3-\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          Appellants  argue that  according to    3672,  the jury\n\nreached  an  improper  verdict  because  appellees  presented  no\n\nevidence that Antonia  consented to or  ratified the donation  of\n\nthe money  in writing.   However,    3672  applies only  when one\n\nspouse  makes a donation.  The statute states that neither spouse\n                                                          \n\nmay donate community property without the  written consent of the\n\nother spouse.  It  requires that when an individual's  rights may\n\nbe affected by her spouse's donation, she must consent in writing\n                           \n\nto the transaction.  It says  nothing of such a requirement  when\n\nboth spouses donate movable property.   The legislature enacted  \n    \n\n3672 to  make both  spouses equal co-administrators  of community\n\nproperty, and to protect  individuals from depletion of community\n\nassets  by their spouses.   Silva Ramos v.  Registrador, 107 P.R.\n                                                       \n\nDec.  240 (1978) (translation at  9).  When  both spouses jointly\n                                                 \n\ngive  a gift  of movable  property, they  literally co-administer\n\nthat  property, and thus neither  party can claim  that the other\n\ndepleted the community assets.1\n\n          In  the  present  case,  the district  court  found  it\n\n                    \n\n1    While  the Puerto  Rico  Supreme  Court  has never  directly\naddressed the issue of whether written consent is  necessary when\nboth spouses together  give a  gift of movable  property, it  has\nstated  in dicta that   3672 requires the written consent of both\nspouses  for  the  disposition  of real  and  personal  community\nproperty.  See Silva Ramos, 107 P.R. Dec. 240 (translation at 9).\n                          \nThis suggests that even  if both spouses make the  donation, they\nboth  must provide written consent.   We find,  however, that the\ndicta contradicts  the express  language of  the statute  and the\npurposes behind it.  Thus,  absent a direct mandate on point,  we\ncannot conclude that when a spouse violates the statute, the same\nspouse can later  hide behind  it to avoid  an already  completed\ndonation.\n\n                               -4-\n\nreasonable for a  jury to  conclude that both  Mateo and  Antonia\n\nknowingly  gave Luis and Noem  a gift of money.  We find no clear\n\nerror  in this ruling.  The record contained testimony that Mateo\n\ntold Luis that he was giving him money as a gift to build a home,\n\nand that he put that money in a joint checking account in both of\n\ntheir names.  (Transcript of Trial Proceedings at 33,  38).  Luis\n\nthen used that money to build a house.  According  to the record,\n\nboth Mateo  and Antonia knew of  the joint bank account.   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n85.   Indeed, Antonia sent money to  her husband for the account,\n\nand she testified that she knew that the money was for a house on\n\ntheir land in  Camuy.  Id.  at 80,  85.  Furthermore,  appellants\n                          \n\nnever  withdrew  money  from  the joint  account,  and  appellees\n\ncontrolled  the check  book.    Id.  at  43.    Appellants  never\n                                   \n\nrequested that  appellees  explain or  justify their  use of  the\n\nmoney  in that account, and  appellees kept all  of the account's\n\ncanceled checks.  Id.  at 45.  Finally, appellants  never claimed\n                     \n\nownership of  the  house before  Luis  and Noem 's  divorce,  and\n\nappellees had the  keys to  the house, an  indicia of  ownership;\n\nappellants did not.  Id. at 49-50.\n                        \n\n          From this evidence, a rational jury could conclude that\n\nboth Mateo and Antonia gave appellees  money as a gift to build a\n\nhouse, and the  weight of  the evidence did  not contradict  this\n\nconclusion.  Thus, the district court properly denied appellants'\n\nalternative motions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -5-\n",

Section 3672\n\nprovides in relevant part:\n\n            Notwithstanding [exceptions not  relevant\n            here],  neither of  the  two spouses  may\n                           \n            donate,   alienate   or   bind    for   a\n            consideration   the   personal  or   real\n            property   of   the  community   property\n            without the written consent of  the other\n                                       \n            spouse, excepting things for  personal or\n            family use in  accordance with the social\n            or economic standing of both spouses.\n\n            Any disposal or  administration act  made\n            with  respect to said  property by either\n                                                     \n            of  the spouses in  violation of this and\n            any other section of this title shall not\n            affect the other spouse or his heirs.\n\n                               -3-\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          Appellants  argue that  according to    3672,  the jury\n\nreached  an  improper  verdict  because  appellees  presented  no\n\nevidence that Antonia  consented to or  ratified the donation  of\n\nthe money  in writing.   However,    3672  applies only  when one\n\nspouse  makes a donation.  The statute states that neither spouse\n                                                          \n\nmay donate community property without the  written consent of the\n\nother spouse.  It  requires that when an individual's  rights may\n\nbe affected by her spouse's donation, she must consent in writing\n                           \n\nto the transaction.  It says  nothing of such a requirement  when\n\nboth spouses donate movable property.   The legislature enacted  \n    \n\n3672 to  make both  spouses equal co-administrators  of community\n\nproperty, and to protect  individuals from depletion of community\n\nassets  by their spouses.   Silva Ramos v.  Registrador, 107 P.R.\n                                                       \n\nDec.  240 (1978) (translation at  9).  When  both spouses jointly\n                                                 \n\ngive  a gift  of movable  property, they  literally co-administer\n\nthat  property, and thus neither  party can claim  that the other\n\ndepleted the community assets.1\n\n          In  the  present  case,  the district  court  found  it\n\n                    \n\n1    While  the Puerto  Rico  Supreme  Court  has never  directly\naddressed the issue of whether written consent is  necessary when\nboth spouses together  give a  gift of movable  property, it  has\nstated  in dicta that   3672 requires the written consent of both\nspouses  for  the  disposition  of real  and  personal  community\nproperty.

We find,  however, that the\ndicta contradicts  the express  language of  the statute  and the\npurposes behind it.  Thus,  absent a direct mandate on point,  we\ncannot conclude that when a spouse violates the statute, the same\nspouse can later  hide behind  it to avoid  an already  completed\ndonation.\n\n                               -4-\n\nreasonable for a  jury to  conclude that both  Mateo and  Antonia\n\nknowingly  gave Luis and Noem  a gift of money.  We find no clear\n\nerror  in this ruling.  The record contained testimony that Mateo\n\ntold Luis that he was giving him money as a gift to build a home,\n\nand that he put that money in a joint checking account in both of\n\ntheir names.  (Transcript of Trial Proceedings at 33,  38).  Luis\n\nthen used that money to build a house.  According  to the record,\n\nboth Mateo  and Antonia knew of  the joint bank account.   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n85.   Indeed, Antonia sent money to  her husband for the account,\n\nand she testified that she knew that the money was for a house on\n\ntheir land in  Camuy.  Id.  at 80,  85.  Furthermore,  appellants\n                          \n\nnever  withdrew  money  from  the joint  account,  and  appellees\n\ncontrolled  the check  book.    Id.  at  43.    Appellants  never\n                                   \n\nrequested that  appellees  explain or  justify their  use of  the\n\nmoney  in that account, and  appellees kept all  of the account's\n\ncanceled checks.  Id.  at 45.  Finally, appellants  never claimed\n                     \n\nownership of  the  house before  Luis  and Noem 's  divorce,  and\n\nappellees had the  keys to  the house, an  indicia of  ownership;\n\nappellants did not.  Id. at 49-50.\n                        \n\n          From this evidence, a rational jury could conclude that\n\nboth Mateo and Antonia gave appellees  money as a gift to build a\n\nhouse, and the  weight of  the evidence did  not contradict  this\n\nconclusion.  Thus, the district court properly denied appellants'\n\nalternative motions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -5-\n</pre>",
