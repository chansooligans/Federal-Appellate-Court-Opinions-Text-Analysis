After the  chapter 11  estate of\n          CYR,  Circuit Judge.\n                             \n\nHilda  Soltero  Harrington  recovered judgment  in  an  adversary\n\nproceeding against Estancias La Ponderosa Development Corporation\n\n(hereinafter \"Ponderosa\"), Ponderosa filed an untimely  notice of\n\nappeal and a motion  to permit late filing under  Bankruptcy Rule\n\n8002(c).    The  bankruptcy court  denied  Ponderosa's motion  to\n\npermit  late  filing,  and,   accordingly,  declined  to   docket\n\nPonderosa's   notice   of   appeal.       Ponderosa   moved   for\n\nreconsideration, which  was denied.  Ponderosa  then appealed the\n\ndenial of  its motion for reconsideration to  the district court.\n\nFollowing  a further appeal to this court to clarify the district\n\ncourt's jurisdiction, the district court reversed the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt's denial  of Ponderosa's motion for  reconsideration of the\n\nRule  8002(c)  motion, and  remanded  with  directions to  docket\n\nPonderosa's  original notice  of appeal.   Appellants  now appeal\n\nfrom the district court remand order.1\n\n          An appellate order entered  by a district court sitting\n\nin bankruptcy  is not appealable to the court of appeals under 28\n\nU.S.C.     158(d)  unless   it  is   \"final,\"  i.e.,   unless  it\n                                                   \n\nconclusively determines  \"a discrete  dispute  within the  larger\n\ncase.\"   See In re  G.S.F. Corp., 938  F.2d 1467, 1473  (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1991); Tringali v.  Hathaway Mach.

As appellants see it, the district court remand\n\norder  is  \"final\" because  it  directs the  bankruptcy  court to\n\ndocket Ponderosa's initial notice  of appeal despite its untimely\n\nfiling, thereby  resolving the  one issue  placed  in dispute  by\n                                         \n\nPonderosa's  appeal from  the  bankruptcy court's  denial of  the\n\nmotion  for  reconsideration.     We  disagree  with  appellants'\n\nanalysis.\n\n          We  recognize  that  \"'finality'  is [to  be]  given  a\n\nflexible interpretation in bankruptcy,\" G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n1472-73, where  necessary to  accommodate concerns unique  to the\n\nnature  of bankruptcy proceedings.   See In re Empresas Noroeste,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  806  F.2d  315,  316-17  (1st  Cir. 1986)  (relaxation  of\n    \n\n\"finality\" doctrine appropriate in bankruptcy proceedings only on\n\nsufficient   showing   of   \"special  considerations   bankruptcy\n\nproceedings deserve\").2   Nevertheless, a  district court  remand\n\n                    \n\n     2As we acknowledged in G.S.F Corp., one such concern is that\n                                       \n\"bankruptcy  cases  typically   involve  numerous   controversies\nbearing only  a slight relationship to each other,\" G.S.F. Corp.,\n                                                                \n938 F.2d at 1473 (emphasis  added), and extraordinary delay could\nresult  if  parties  whose  substantive  rights  had  been  fully\nlitigated  below were required to await  resolution of the entire\nbankruptcy  case before taking an  appeal.  For  example, we have\nentertained an immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C.   1291 to resolve\na  dispute over  the  authority and  procedure  for appointing  a\nchapter 11  trustee.   See In re  Plaza de  Diego Shopping  Ctr.,\n                                                                 \nInc.,  911 F.2d  820, 826 (1st  Cir. 1990) (noting  that \"[i]f an\n    \nappeal were  postponed until a  plan of reorganization  were con-\nfirmed,  there would be no satisfactory way to vindicate the U.S.\nTrustee's right to appoint, as there is no authority to appoint a\nnew  trustee after  confirmation\"  of a  chapter  11 plan).    On\nsomewhat different  grounds, we have  permitted immediate appeals\nfrom  district  court  orders   lifting  automatic  stays.    See\n                                                                 \n\n                                3\n\norder in an  intermediate appeal  from a judgment  entered in  an\n\nadversary proceeding  is not  final and appealable  under section\n\n158(d) of the Judicial Code, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a), (b); Fed.\n                                \n\nR.  Bankr.  P.  7054(a),  9002,  9014,  unless  it  resolves  all\n\nprocedural  and  substantive  issues  necessary  to  conclude the\n\nentire  appeal.3    Were  appellate review  available  on  demand\n\nwhenever a district court definitively resolved a contested legal\n                                                                 \n\nissue, without regard to  whether the entire adversary proceeding\n     \n\nhad  been resolved,  the  \"finality\" rule  would be  eviscerated.\n\nCf., e.g., American Colonial Broadcasting, 758 F.2d at 801 (\"[a]n\n                                         \n\n                    \n\nTringali, 796  F.2d at 557;  see also G.S.F.  Corp., 938  F.2d at\n                                                   \n1473 (citing In re Chateaugay Corp., 880 F.2d 1509, 1512 (2d Cir.\n                                   \n1989)).  But see infra note 3.\n                      \n\n     3An important purpose  of the Bankruptcy Reform  Act of 1978\nwas to  conform  the practice  and procedure  in Bankruptcy  Code\ncases as near as may be to ordinary civil actions.  See, e.g., 28\n                                                             \nU.S.C.    158(c); Fed. R. Bankr.  P. 7054(a), 8002  &amp; 9002.  With\nthat aim in  mind, most Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are made\ndirectly applicable  in certain proceedings in  bankruptcy.  See,\n                                                                \ne.g., Fed.  R. Bankr. P. 7001-7071  (adversary proceedings), 9014\n    \n(contested  matters).    The  Bankruptcy  Rules  recognize  three\ndistinct  types   of  proceedings   within  a  bankruptcy   case:\nadversary proceedings, administrative proceedings,  and contested\nmatters.   Adversary  proceedings  are most  like ordinary  civil\nactions;  contested  matters are  substantially  similar; whereas\nmost administrative proceedings are  quite dissimilar to ordinary\ncivil actions.\n     The  great  similarity between  an  adversary  proceeding in\nbankruptcy   and  an   ordinary  civil   action   has  particular\nsignificance  in the present  context.  In  the typical adversary\nproceeding,  the \"finality\"  determination closely  resembles the\nfinality  determination  in  \"an  ordinary  'case'  [between  the\nparties] in a  district court,\" In re Public  Serv. Co., 898 F.2d\n                                                       \n1,  2  (1st Cir.  1990).   Just as  an appeal  in a  civil action\nnormally may not be  taken under section 1291 until all claims of\nall parties to the action have been finally resolved, see Fed. R.\n                                                         \nCiv.  P. 54(b), so too  must some special  justification be shown\nfor  departing  from  the  finality rule  relating  to  adversary\nproceedings  and contested matters, see Fed. R. Bank. P. 7054(a),\n                                       \n9002(1) &amp; 9014.  See also supra note 2.\n                               \n\n                                4\n\norder which 'does  not finally  determine a cause  of action  but\n\nonly decides some intervening matter pertaining to the cause, and\n\nwhich requires further steps to  be taken in order to enable  the\n\ncourt  to  adjudicate the  cause  on the  merits,'  is considered\n\ninterlocutory\") (quoting In re Merle's, Inc., 481  F.2d 1016 (9th\n                                            \n\nCir. 1973)).\n\n          The district court remand order contemplated no \"signi-\n\nficant further proceedings\" before the bankruptcy court; that is,\n\nthe bankruptcy court's role on remand    docketing the late-filed\n\nnotice of appeal    fairly can be characterized as \"ministerial.\"\n\nSee  In re Gould  &amp; Eberhardt Gear  Mach. Corp., 852  F.2d 26, 29\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir. 1988); In  re Riggsby, 745  F.2d 1153, 1156  (7th Cir.\n                                \n\n1984)).   Moreover,  the  narrow issue  presented by  Ponderosa's\n\ncurrent  appeal to the district court, i.e., the propriety of the\n                                           \n\nbankruptcy  court's denial  of the  Rule 8002(c) motion,  has now\n\nbeen decided.   Nevertheless,  upon the docketing  of Ponderosa's\n\noriginal notice  of appeal  from the judgment  of the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt, all substantive and  procedural claims raised by Ponderosa\n\nin its challenge to the merits of the underlying bankruptcy court\n\njudgment  will remain  to be  determined in  the district  court.\n\nShould  the  district  court  resolve  the  merits  favorably  to\n\nappellants,  the present  appeal from  the district  court remand\n\norder \"may well [be]  obviate[d] . . . .\"  Bowers  v. Connecticut\n                                                                 \n\nNat'l Bank, 847 F.2d 1019, 1023 (2d Cir. 1988); Riggsby, 745 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 1155-56.  Thus, the  remand order is not final and  appealable\n\nunder  28 U.S.C.    158(a),(d).   See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(a),(b);\n                                     \n\n                                5\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 7054(a), 9001(7), 9002(1), (2),(5).\n\n          Finally,   no   cognizable   \"hardship\"    or   special\n\nbankruptcy-related  consideration  is   demonstrated  simply   by\n\npointing to the  time and expense  of litigating an  intermediate\n\nappeal to its  conclusion in  the district court.   See  Empresas\n                                                                 \n\nNoroeste, 806  F.2d at 317; see also In re El San Juan Hotel, 809\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  151, 154 (1st Cir.  1987) (\"The burden  of litigation . . .\n\ncannot alone constitute the irreparable harm necessary to warrant\n\nappellate  jurisdiction  over  an interlocutory  order.\").

The  bankruptcy court  denied  Ponderosa's motion  to\n\npermit  late  filing,  and,   accordingly,  declined  to   docket\n\nPonderosa's   notice   of   appeal.

But see infra note 3.\n                      \n\n     3An important purpose  of the Bankruptcy Reform  Act of 1978\nwas to  conform  the practice  and procedure  in Bankruptcy  Code\ncases as near as may be to ordinary civil actions.  See, e.g., 28\n                                                             \nU.S.C.    158(c); Fed. R. Bankr.  P. 7054(a), 8002  &amp; 9002.  With\nthat aim in  mind, most Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are made\ndirectly applicable  in certain proceedings in  bankruptcy.  See,\n                                                                \ne.g., Fed.  R. Bankr. P. 7001-7071  (adversary proceedings), 9014\n    \n(contested  matters).    The  Bankruptcy  Rules  recognize  three\ndistinct  types   of  proceedings   within  a  bankruptcy   case:\nadversary proceedings, administrative proceedings,  and contested\nmatters.   Adversary  proceedings  are most  like ordinary  civil\nactions;  contested  matters are  substantially  similar; whereas\nmost administrative proceedings are  quite dissimilar to ordinary\ncivil actions.\n     The  great  similarity between  an  adversary  proceeding in\nbankruptcy   and  an   ordinary  civil   action   has  particular\nsignificance  in the present  context.  In  the typical adversary\nproceeding,  the \"finality\"  determination closely  resembles the\nfinality  determination  in  \"an  ordinary  'case'  [between  the\nparties] in a  district court,\" In re Public  Serv.
