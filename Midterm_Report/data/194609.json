Claimant Bienvenido Gonzalez Garcia applied\n               \n\nfor  Social Security disability benefits on May 24, 1989.  He\n\nalleged an onset  date of April 15, 1988 and  claimed that he\n\nhad  a back condition and a mental impairment.  After holding\n\na  hearing,  an administrative  law  judge  (ALJ) found  that\n\nclaimant  was  not  entitled  to disability  benefits.    The\n\nAppeals Council  denied claimant's  request for review.   The\n\ndistrict  court  affirmed the  Secretary's decision  and this\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n     Claimant was injured  at work  when he tried  to lift  a\n\nsteel  beam.  He sought treatment at the State Insurance Fund\n\n(SIF) for back pain.   According to claimant, he was  given a\n\ncourse  of physical therapy which left him feeling worse.  At\n\nsome point, he tried to resume work but could not  because of\n\nthe pain.  All of his  past jobs involved heavy lifting  with\n\nfrequent bending  and stooping.   Since his  injury, claimant\n\nstates that he cannot  sit, stand or  walk for any length  of\n\ntime  and he is constantly changing position.  He cannot bend\n\nor stoop.   He cannot  lift objects weighing  more than  five\n\npounds.\n\n     As for his daily  activities, claimant testified that he\n\ncould not take care of his personal needs; his wife helps him\n\nto bathe  and dress.  He  does not leave the  house except to\n\nvisit his father.  Sometimes he watches television or listens\n\n                             -2-\n\nto the radio.  He cannot help with household  chores and does\n\nnot drive.  During the day, he sits or stands on the balcony;\n\nhe never walks.\n\n     Claimant described  his pain  as constant; it  starts in\n\nhis  lower back and spreads to his buttocks, thighs, legs and\n\nfeet.  He also complained of \"palpitations\" in his bones.  He\n\ndoes  not sleep well due to the  pain and cramps in his legs.\n\nIn addition to his  back pain, he suffers from  headaches and\n\nnosebleeds.   He takes medication which relieves the pain for\n\nabout two hours.\n\n     Claimant also takes medication for a dysthymic disorder.\n\nHe  stated that  he hears  voices calling  his name  and sees\n\nshadows.   He is  irritable and  noises bother him.   He  has\n\nproblems relating to people and prefers  to be alone.  He has\n\nreceived sporadic  therapy for  this impairment at  the local\n\nmental health center.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n     The  ALJ  determined   that  claimant  has   a  possible\n\nherniated disc at L5-S1, back pain  and an affective disorder\n\nwhich alone or in combination did not meet  the listings.  He\n\ncredited claimant's  allegations of  pain to the  extent that\n\nclaimant  was  precluded  from  engaging in  strenuous  work-\n\nrelated activities.  Nonetheless, the ALJ found that claimant\n\nretained the  residual functional capacity  (RFC) to  perform\n\nthe exertional requirements of work except to the extent that\n\n                             -3-\n\nclaimant could not lift over ten pounds.  Also,  he could not\n\nsit, stand  or walk  for over  one hour at  a time;  however,\n\nclaimant could perform each of these activities for up to six\n\nhours  per eight-hour workday.  He could stoop and kneel only\n\noccasionally.  Aside from these limits, claimant retained the\n\ncapacity to perform the full range of sedentary work.  \n\n     The  ALJ determined that Rule  201.25 of Table  1 of the\n\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part  404, Subpt. P,\n\nApp.  2 (1992) (the \"Grid\"),  would direct a  finding of \"not\n\ndisabled\"  for  a  person  such  as  claimant  --  a  younger\n\nindividual  with  a  limited  education (7th  grade)  and  no\n\ntransferable work skills. Because claimant's capacity for the\n\nfull  range of  sedentary  work had  not been  \"significantly\n\ncompromised\" by  his nonexertional limits, the  ALJ used Rule\n\n201.25  as a  framework  to conclude  that  claimant was  not\n\ndisabled.   In  so finding,  the ALJ  stated  that claimant's\n\nmental   impairment  did   not   impose  \"more   than  slight\n\nlimitations   in  those  areas  considered  relevant  to  the\n\ncapacity to perform work-related activities.\"\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n     On  appeal, claimant  essentially argues  that his  back\n\ncondition prevents him from  engaging in even sedentary work.\n\nHe also  avers that the ALJ erred in applying the Grid on the\n\nground  that his  nonexertional impairments  -- pain  and his\n\nemotional condition  -- significantly  limit  his ability  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nperform the full range  of sedentary work.  We  address these\n\nissues separately.\n\n     A.  Back Condition\n                       \n\n     The record contains conflicting evidence  concerning the\n\neffect   of  claimant's   back   problem   on  his   physical\n\ncapabilities.   X-ray  results  showed a  20  to  25  percent\n\nnarrowing of the disc space at L5-S1, suggestive of a bulging\n\nor  herniated disc.   Also,  a C-T  scan revealed  a possible\n\nbulging  or herniated disc at L4-L5 with a slight swelling of\n\nthe left nerve root.\n\n     Over the course of his  treatment at the State Insurance\n\nFund, claimant's condition varied.  For example, on September\n\n30 and October 13, 1988, claimant exhibited persistent lumbar\n\nmuscle  spasm  and  limited  range  of  motion.   However,  a\n\nNovember   2,  1988  special   medical  report   stated  that\n\nclaimant's back was well  and there was no muscle spasm.   In\n\naddition,  claimant's range  of motion  was normal  and there\n\nwere  no neurological  deficits.   The report  concluded that\n\nclaimant could perform  light work and should be  referred to\n\nvocational  rehabilitation.    Although   claimant  exhibited\n\nmarked limitation in the movement of his trunk on November 7,\n\n1988,  there  still  was  no  significant  muscle  spasm  and\n\nclaimant could  walk without  difficulty.  When  claimant was\n\ndischarged  from  the SIF  in  April 1989,  he  had residuals\n\n                             -5-\n\nconsisting of slight spasm of the para-vertebral muscles with\n\nslight limitation of movement of the trunk in all directions.\n\nClaimant refused a referral to vocational rehabilitation.\n\n     A  neurological  evaluation   performed  in  July   1989\n\nrevealed no evidence of  paravertebral muscle spasms or motor\n\natrophy;  there was  normal  strength in  all muscles  and no\n\nmotor reflex  or sensory  disturbances.  Claimant's  gait and\n\nposture  were normal.   He  refused to  bend his  spine.   In\n\nJanuary  1990, claimant  was again  examined by  a consulting\n\nneurologist.   At this time,  claimant could not  walk on his\n\nheels  or toes, exhibited some  weakness of the  left toe and\n\nhad  spasm in his paravertebral muscles.  His range of motion\n\nwas limited.1\n\n     A nonexamining physician completed an RFC form in August\n\n1989.   This form reveals  that claimant can  frequently lift\n\nand  carry up  to ten  pounds and  occasionally can  lift and\n\ncarry twenty  pounds.   He  can only  occasionally stoop  and\n\ncrawl.   His  disc pathology  limits his  ability to  use his\n\nlower extremities to  push and  pull.  However,  he can  sit,\n\nstand and walk for up to six hours per work day. \n\n     The medical  findings outlined  above amply  support the\n\nconclusion  that claimant  retained the  ability to  meet the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Neither  of these physicians  filled out  RFC assessments\ndespite the  requirement in  the regulations that  a complete\nconsultative examination  should include such  findings.  See\n                                                             \n20 C.F.R.   404.1519n(c)(6).\n\n                             -6-\n\nexertional  demands  of sedentary  work.    Muscle spasm  and\n\nlimits  in range  of  motion were  not consistently  present.\n\nFurther, claimant rarely exhibited any neurological or  motor\n\ndeficits.     Finally,  the  RFC  assessment  indicates  that\n\nclaimant's disc  problems would not prevent  him from working\n\nat  the  sedentary  level.     Because  \"a  reasonable  mind,\n\nreviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, could accept\n\nit as adequate to support his conclusion,\" we must uphold the\n\nSecretary's factual  determinations.  Rodriguez  v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health and  Human Services,  647 F.2d 218,  222 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1981).\n\n     B.  Nonexertional Impairments\n                                  \n\n     Next,  claimant alleges  that the  ALJ did  not properly\n\ncredit his  complaints of totally  disabling pain.   We agree\n\nthat there exists an  objective medical impairment -- bulging\n\nor  herniated discs at L4-L5 and L5-S1 -- that can reasonably\n\nbe expected to cause pain.  See  Avery v. Secretary of Health\n                                                             \n\nand   Human  Services,   797   F.2d  19   (1st  Cir.   1986).\n                     \n\nNonetheless, as  described above,  the dearth of  evidence of\n\nmotor, sensory or strength  deficits conflicts with the level\n\nof pain  claimant alleges.  Further,  claimant testified that\n\nmedication  relieved the pain for  up to two  hours.  Because\n\nthe ALJ diligently considered  the factors outlined in Avery,\n                                                            \n\nwe find that his decision concerning the level  of claimant's\n\n                             -7-\n\npain is supported by substantial record  evidence and did not\n\npreclude reliance on the Grid.2\n\n     Claimant's mental impairment presents a closer question.\n\nAbsent  significant  nonexertional   limitations,  the   Grid\n\nprovides a  \"streamlined\" method  by which the  Secretary can\n\nsustain  his burden of proof  at step five  of the sequential\n\nevaluation  process.  Ortiz v.  Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices,  890 F.2d 520,  524 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (per curiam);\n        \n\nSherwin v. Secretary of  Health and Human Services, 685  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1,  2 (1st  Cir. 1982),  cert. denied,  461 U.S.  958 (1983).\n                                     \n\nHowever, where  a claimant has a  nonexertional impairment in\n\naddition to an exertional limit,  the Grid may not accurately\n\nreflect  the  availability  of  jobs such  a  claimant  could\n\nperform.   Ortiz,  890 F.2d  at 524;  Gagnon v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth  and Human Services, 666  F.2d 662, 665  n.6 (1st Cir.\n                          \n\n1981).\n\n     The decision  to  rely on  the  Grid in  this  situation\n\ndepends   upon   whether    claimant's   mental    impairment\n\n\"significantly  affects  [his]  ability to  perform  the full\n\nrange  of  jobs\"  at  the sedentary  level.    See    Lugo v.\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n2.  We also note that  claimant's limitations in stooping and\ncrawling -- nonexertional impairments -- do not significantly\nlimit his access to  the full range of  sedentary work.   See\n                                                             \nSocial  Security   Ruling  85-15  (to  meet  requirements  of\nsedentary  work,  an  individual  would need  to  stoop  only\noccasionally  and would  rarely  be required  to crawl);  cf.\n                                                             \nFrustaglia  v. Secretary  of Health  and Human  Services, 829\n                                                        \nF.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).\n\n                             -8-\n\nSecretary  of Health and Human Services, 794 F.2d 14, 17 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1986)  (per curiam);  Ortiz, 890  F.2d at 524.   If  the\n                                \n\noccupational   base   is   significantly  limited   by   this\n\nimpairment, the Secretary  erred in using  the Grid to  carry\n\nhis  burden at step five.   See  Ortiz, 890  F.2d at 524.  In\n                                      \n\nsuch  a case, the testimony of  a vocational expert generally\n\nwould have been required.  Id.\n                             \n\n     Here, the  ALJ  essentially determined  that  claimant's\n\nemotional condition  was not severe and thus, did not impinge\n\non  claimant's  ability  to  engage  in  the  full  range  of\n\nsedentary,  unskilled work.   There are two  distinct sets of\n\nmental capabilities which are required for the performance of\n\nunskilled work.  Id. at 526; Social Security Ruling (SSR) 85-\n                    \n\n15.  These are  (1) the intellectual ability to  perform such\n\nwork and (2) the ability to cope with the demands of the work\n\nenvironment per se.  Id.\n                       \n\n     As  for the first category  -- the ability  to carry out\n\nsimple instructions,  respond to  supervision  and cope  with\n\ncoworkers -- we believe that there  is sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport  the  ALJ's  conclusion  that   claimant's  dysthymic\n\ndisorder  did not  significantly impair  his functioning.   A\n\nconsultative examination performed  by a psychiatrist in  May\n\n1990  indicates  that  claimant  was  coherent, relevant,  in\n\ncontact with  reality and  completely oriented.   His thought\n\nprocesses  were  organized  and  there  was  no  evidence  of\n\n                             -9-\n\ndelusions  or  hallucinations.     His  memory  was   intact.\n\nAlthough  his  attention,  concentration  and  retention were\n\n\"slightly diminished,\" claimant's judgment and reasoning were\n\nnot impaired.   The  psychiatrist diagnosed a  mild dysthymic\n\ndisorder; claimant's prognosis was fair.   \n\n     This   psychiatrist   also   completed  a   mental   RFC\n\nassessment.    He  indicated  that  claimant's  abilities  to\n\nmaintain attention and to  understand, remember and carry out\n\nboth complex  and detailed job  instructions were good.   His\n\ncapacity to deal with simple instructions  was unlimited.  He\n\nalso was rated as having good abilities in the areas of using\n\njudgment, interacting with supervisors, relating to coworkers\n\nand functioning independently.\n\n     The second  category includes  the ability to  remain in\n\nthe workplace the entire day and to attend work regularly and\n\npunctually.   In  this  area, claimant  was  rated  as  being\n\ncapable of demonstrating responsibility, relating predictably\n\nin social  situations and  behaving in an  emotionally stable\n\nmanner.   However, his ability to deal with \"work stress\" was\n\nonly  fair.  Fair  is defined on  the RFC  form as \"seriously\n\nlimited but not precluded.\"\n\n     Given the evidence anent claimant's  limited capacity to\n\ndeal with \"work stress,\" his  mental impairment might well be\n\n                             -10-\n\ndeemed of some  severity.3   But, we believe  that the  ALJ's\n\nreliance  on  the  Grid  in  this  particular  situation  was\n\nnevertheless appropriate  (although by no  means inevitable).\n\nSee Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 524 (explaining that claimant's mental\n         \n\nimpairment,  even if  severe,  is  not  considered  disabling\n\nunless it has eroded the occupational base for the full range\n\nof  sedentary, unskilled work).   Aside from the finding that\n\nclaimant was  seriously limited  in his capacity  to confront\n\nthe  stress of  work in  general, the  examining psychiatrist\n                                \n\nconcluded  that claimant's  abilities  in the  more  specific\n\nareas  of dealing  with the  work environment  -- maintaining\n\nconcentration,  being reliable,  behaving  in an  emotionally\n\nstable manner  and accepting supervision -- were  good.  Also\n\nsignificant is  the fact  that claimant's situation  does not\n\nplace him  anywhere near  the dividing line  between disabled\n\nand not disabled under  Table 1 of the Grid.  See id. at 527-\n                                                     \n\n28.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons,  the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed. \n                 \n\n                    \n\n3.  An impairment is not severe only when it has no more than\n\"a minimal effect on the person's .  . . mental ability . . .\nto perform basic work activities.\"  SSR 85-28.\n\n                             -11-\n",

Claimant Bienvenido Gonzalez Garcia applied\n               \n\nfor  Social Security disability benefits on May 24, 1989.  He\n\nalleged an onset  date of April 15, 1988 and  claimed that he\n\nhad  a back condition and a mental impairment.  After holding\n\na  hearing,  an administrative  law  judge  (ALJ) found  that\n\nclaimant  was  not  entitled  to disability  benefits.    The\n\nAppeals Council  denied claimant's  request for review.   The\n\ndistrict  court  affirmed the  Secretary's decision  and this\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n     Claimant was injured  at work  when he tried  to lift  a\n\nsteel  beam.  He sought treatment at the State Insurance Fund\n\n(SIF) for back pain.   According to claimant, he was  given a\n\ncourse  of physical therapy which left him feeling worse.  At\n\nsome point, he tried to resume work but could not  because of\n\nthe pain.  All of his  past jobs involved heavy lifting  with\n\nfrequent bending  and stooping.   Since his  injury, claimant\n\nstates that he cannot  sit, stand or  walk for any length  of\n\ntime  and he is constantly changing position.  He cannot bend\n\nor stoop.   He cannot  lift objects weighing  more than  five\n\npounds.\n\n     As for his daily  activities, claimant testified that he\n\ncould not take care of his personal needs; his wife helps him\n\nto bathe  and dress.  He  does not leave the  house except to\n\nvisit his father.  Sometimes he watches television or listens\n\n                             -2-\n\nto the radio.  He cannot help with household  chores and does\n\nnot drive.  During the day, he sits or stands on the balcony;\n\nhe never walks.\n\n     Claimant described  his pain  as constant; it  starts in\n\nhis  lower back and spreads to his buttocks, thighs, legs and\n\nfeet.  He also complained of \"palpitations\" in his bones.  He\n\ndoes  not sleep well due to the  pain and cramps in his legs.\n\nIn addition to his  back pain, he suffers from  headaches and\n\nnosebleeds.   He takes medication which relieves the pain for\n\nabout two hours.\n\n     Claimant also takes medication for a dysthymic disorder.\n\nHe  stated that  he hears  voices calling  his name  and sees\n\nshadows.   He is  irritable and  noises bother him.   He  has\n\nproblems relating to people and prefers  to be alone.  He has\n\nreceived sporadic  therapy for  this impairment at  the local\n\nmental health center.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n     The  ALJ  determined   that  claimant  has   a  possible\n\nherniated disc at L5-S1, back pain  and an affective disorder\n\nwhich alone or in combination did not meet  the listings.  He\n\ncredited claimant's  allegations of  pain to the  extent that\n\nclaimant  was  precluded  from  engaging in  strenuous  work-\n\nrelated activities.  Nonetheless, the ALJ found that claimant\n\nretained the  residual functional capacity  (RFC) to  perform\n\nthe exertional requirements of work except to the extent that\n\n                             -3-\n\nclaimant could not lift over ten pounds.  Also,  he could not\n\nsit, stand  or walk  for over  one hour at  a time;  however,\n\nclaimant could perform each of these activities for up to six\n\nhours  per eight-hour workday.  He could stoop and kneel only\n\noccasionally.  Aside from these limits, claimant retained the\n\ncapacity to perform the full range of sedentary work.  \n\n     The  ALJ determined that Rule  201.25 of Table  1 of the\n\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part  404, Subpt. P,\n\nApp.  2 (1992) (the \"Grid\"),  would direct a  finding of \"not\n\ndisabled\"  for  a  person  such  as  claimant  --  a  younger\n\nindividual  with  a  limited  education (7th  grade)  and  no\n\ntransferable work skills. Because claimant's capacity for the\n\nfull  range of  sedentary  work had  not been  \"significantly\n\ncompromised\" by  his nonexertional limits, the  ALJ used Rule\n\n201.25  as a  framework  to conclude  that  claimant was  not\n\ndisabled.   In  so finding,  the ALJ  stated  that claimant's\n\nmental   impairment  did   not   impose  \"more   than  slight\n\nlimitations   in  those  areas  considered  relevant  to  the\n\ncapacity to perform work-related activities.\"\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n     On  appeal, claimant  essentially argues  that his  back\n\ncondition prevents him from  engaging in even sedentary work.\n\nHe also  avers that the ALJ erred in applying the Grid on the\n\nground  that his  nonexertional impairments  -- pain  and his\n\nemotional condition  -- significantly  limit  his ability  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nperform the full range  of sedentary work.  We  address these\n\nissues separately.\n\n     A.  Back Condition\n                       \n\n     The record contains conflicting evidence  concerning the\n\neffect   of  claimant's   back   problem   on  his   physical\n\ncapabilities.   X-ray  results  showed a  20  to  25  percent\n\nnarrowing of the disc space at L5-S1, suggestive of a bulging\n\nor  herniated disc.   Also,  a C-T  scan revealed  a possible\n\nbulging  or herniated disc at L4-L5 with a slight swelling of\n\nthe left nerve root.\n\n     Over the course of his  treatment at the State Insurance\n\nFund, claimant's condition varied.  For example, on September\n\n30 and October 13, 1988, claimant exhibited persistent lumbar\n\nmuscle  spasm  and  limited  range  of  motion.   However,  a\n\nNovember   2,  1988  special   medical  report   stated  that\n\nclaimant's back was well  and there was no muscle spasm.   In\n\naddition,  claimant's range  of motion  was normal  and there\n\nwere  no neurological  deficits.   The report  concluded that\n\nclaimant could perform  light work and should be  referred to\n\nvocational  rehabilitation.    Although   claimant  exhibited\n\nmarked limitation in the movement of his trunk on November 7,\n\n1988,  there  still  was  no  significant  muscle  spasm  and\n\nclaimant could  walk without  difficulty.  When  claimant was\n\ndischarged  from  the SIF  in  April 1989,  he  had residuals\n\n                             -5-\n\nconsisting of slight spasm of the para-vertebral muscles with\n\nslight limitation of movement of the trunk in all directions.\n\nClaimant refused a referral to vocational rehabilitation.\n\n     A  neurological  evaluation   performed  in  July   1989\n\nrevealed no evidence of  paravertebral muscle spasms or motor\n\natrophy;  there was  normal  strength in  all muscles  and no\n\nmotor reflex  or sensory  disturbances.  Claimant's  gait and\n\nposture  were normal.   He  refused to  bend his  spine.   In\n\nJanuary  1990, claimant  was again  examined by  a consulting\n\nneurologist.   At this time,  claimant could not  walk on his\n\nheels  or toes, exhibited some  weakness of the  left toe and\n\nhad  spasm in his paravertebral muscles.  His range of motion\n\nwas limited.1\n\n     A nonexamining physician completed an RFC form in August\n\n1989.   This form reveals  that claimant can  frequently lift\n\nand  carry up  to ten  pounds and  occasionally can  lift and\n\ncarry twenty  pounds.   He  can only  occasionally stoop  and\n\ncrawl.   His  disc pathology  limits his  ability to  use his\n\nlower extremities to  push and  pull.  However,  he can  sit,\n\nstand and walk for up to six hours per work day. \n\n     The medical  findings outlined  above amply  support the\n\nconclusion  that claimant  retained the  ability to  meet the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Neither  of these physicians  filled out  RFC assessments\ndespite the  requirement in  the regulations that  a complete\nconsultative examination  should include such  findings.  See\n                                                             \n20 C.F.R.   404.1519n(c)(6).\n\n                             -6-\n\nexertional  demands  of sedentary  work.    Muscle spasm  and\n\nlimits  in range  of  motion were  not consistently  present.\n\nFurther, claimant rarely exhibited any neurological or  motor\n\ndeficits.     Finally,  the  RFC  assessment  indicates  that\n\nclaimant's disc  problems would not prevent  him from working\n\nat  the  sedentary  level.     Because  \"a  reasonable  mind,\n\nreviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, could accept\n\nit as adequate to support his conclusion,\" we must uphold the\n\nSecretary's factual  determinations.  Rodriguez  v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health and  Human Services,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389936\"><a href=\"/opinion/389936/maria-s-rodriguez-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  222 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1981).\n\n     B.  Nonexertional Impairments\n                                  \n\n     Next,  claimant alleges  that the  ALJ did  not properly\n\ncredit his  complaints of totally  disabling pain.   We agree\n\nthat there exists an  objective medical impairment -- bulging\n\nor  herniated discs at L4-L5 and L5-S1 -- that can reasonably\n\nbe expected to cause pain.  See  Avery v. Secretary of Health\n                                                             \n\nand   Human  Services,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st  Cir.   1986).\n                     \n\nNonetheless, as  described above,  the dearth of  evidence of\n\nmotor, sensory or strength  deficits conflicts with the level\n\nof pain  claimant alleges.  Further,  claimant testified that\n\nmedication  relieved the pain for  up to two  hours.  Because\n\nthe ALJ diligently considered  the factors outlined in Avery,\n                                                            \n\nwe find that his decision concerning the level  of claimant's\n\n                             -7-\n\npain is supported by substantial record  evidence and did not\n\npreclude reliance on the Grid.2\n\n     Claimant's mental impairment presents a closer question.\n\nAbsent  significant  nonexertional   limitations,  the   Grid\n\nprovides a  \"streamlined\" method  by which the  Secretary can\n\nsustain  his burden of proof  at step five  of the sequential\n\nevaluation  process.

Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth  and Human Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398008\"><a href=\"/opinion/398008/roger-gagnon-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665  n.6 (1st Cir.\n                          \n\n1981).\n\n     The decision  to  rely on  the  Grid in  this  situation\n\ndepends   upon   whether    claimant's   mental    impairment\n\n\"significantly  affects  [his]  ability to  perform  the full\n\nrange  of  jobs\"  at  the sedentary  level.    See    Lugo v.\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n2.

If  the\n                                \n\noccupational   base   is   significantly  limited   by   this\n\nimpairment, the Secretary  erred in using  the Grid to  carry\n\nhis  burden at step five.   See  Ortiz, 890  F.2d at 524.  In\n                                      \n\nsuch  a case, the testimony of  a vocational expert generally\n\nwould have been required.  Id.\n                             \n\n     Here, the  ALJ  essentially determined  that  claimant's\n\nemotional condition  was not severe and thus, did not impinge\n\non  claimant's  ability  to  engage  in  the  full  range  of\n\nsedentary,  unskilled work.   There are two  distinct sets of\n\nmental capabilities which are required for the performance of\n\nunskilled work.  Id. at 526; Social Security Ruling (SSR) 85-\n                    \n\n15.  These are  (1) the intellectual ability to  perform such\n\nwork and (2) the ability to cope with the demands of the work\n\nenvironment per se.  Id.\n                       \n\n     As  for the first category  -- the ability  to carry out\n\nsimple instructions,  respond to  supervision  and cope  with\n\ncoworkers -- we believe that there  is sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport  the  ALJ's  conclusion  that   claimant's  dysthymic\n\ndisorder  did not  significantly impair  his functioning.   A\n\nconsultative examination performed  by a psychiatrist in  May\n\n1990  indicates  that  claimant  was  coherent, relevant,  in\n\ncontact with  reality and  completely oriented.   His thought\n\nprocesses  were  organized  and  there  was  no  evidence  of\n\n                             -9-\n\ndelusions  or  hallucinations.     His  memory  was   intact.\n\nAlthough  his  attention,  concentration  and  retention were\n\n\"slightly diminished,\" claimant's judgment and reasoning were\n\nnot impaired.   The  psychiatrist diagnosed a  mild dysthymic\n\ndisorder; claimant's prognosis was fair.   \n\n     This   psychiatrist   also   completed  a   mental   RFC\n\nassessment.    He  indicated  that  claimant's  abilities  to\n\nmaintain attention and to  understand, remember and carry out\n\nboth complex  and detailed job  instructions were good.   His\n\ncapacity to deal with simple instructions  was unlimited.  He\n\nalso was rated as having good abilities in the areas of using\n\njudgment, interacting with supervisors, relating to coworkers\n\nand functioning independently.\n\n     The second  category includes  the ability to  remain in\n\nthe workplace the entire day and to attend work regularly and\n\npunctually.   In  this  area, claimant  was  rated  as  being\n\ncapable of demonstrating responsibility, relating predictably\n\nin social  situations and  behaving in an  emotionally stable\n\nmanner.   However, his ability to deal with \"work stress\" was\n\nonly  fair.  Fair  is defined on  the RFC  form as \"seriously\n\nlimited but not precluded.\"\n\n     Given the evidence anent claimant's  limited capacity to\n\ndeal with \"work stress,\" his  mental impairment might well be\n\n                             -10-\n\ndeemed of some  severity.3   But, we believe  that the  ALJ's\n\nreliance  on  the  Grid  in  this  particular  situation  was\n\nnevertheless appropriate  (although by no  means inevitable).\n\nSee Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 524 (explaining that claimant's mental\n         \n\nimpairment,  even if  severe,  is  not  considered  disabling\n\nunless it has eroded the occupational base for the full range\n\nof  sedentary, unskilled work).   Aside from the finding that\n\nclaimant was  seriously limited  in his capacity  to confront\n\nthe  stress of  work in  general, the  examining psychiatrist\n                                \n\nconcluded  that claimant's  abilities  in the  more  specific\n\nareas  of dealing  with the  work environment  -- maintaining\n\nconcentration,  being reliable,  behaving  in an  emotionally\n\nstable manner  and accepting supervision -- were  good.  Also\n\nsignificant is  the fact  that claimant's situation  does not\n\nplace him  anywhere near  the dividing line  between disabled\n\nand not disabled under  Table 1 of the Grid.
