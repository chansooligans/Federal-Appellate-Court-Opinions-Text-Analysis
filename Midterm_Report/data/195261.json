Defendant-appellant George  Labonte\r                                 \n\npled guilty  to possession with intent  to distribute cocaine\n\nand distribution  of it.   See 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1).   The\r                                          \n\ndistrict court  determined that Labonte is  a career offender\n\nunder   the   Sentencing   Guidelines   and   sentenced   him\n\naccordingly.  Labonte challenges  his sentence, claiming that\n\nthe district court erred in denying his motion for a downward\n\ndeparture, pursuant to U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, on  the grounds that\n\nhis  criminal  history  category  (VI)  over-represented  the\n\nseriousness of his criminal  record.  We dismiss for  lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          We have  not addressed whether a downward departure\n\npursuant  to    4A1.3  is  permissible in  a  career offender\n\ncase.1   We  need not  resolve this  issue here.   In  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v.  Norflett, 922 F.2d 50, 54  n.5 (1st Cir. 1990), we\r                               \n\nstated  that  to  the   extent  downward  departures  may  be\n\nallowable in career offender cases,  \"they must, at the  very\n\nleast, be  premised on the same  considerations of meaningful\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  A  number of  other  circuits  have  held  that     4A1.3\nauthorizes   a  downward  departure   when  criminal  history\ncategory  VI,  assigned  pursuant  to  the   career  offender\nguidelines, significantly over-represents the  seriousness of\na  defendant's past  criminal conduct  and the  likelihood of\nrecidivism.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Beckham, 968  F.2d\r                                                              \n47, 54 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing cases from the 4th, 8th, 9th,\nand 10th circuits).\r\n\natypicality that apply across  the board.\"2   In  the instant\n\ncase, the  record is  clear that the  district court  assumed\n\nthat  it had  the authority  to depart  from the  guidelines.\n\nAfter careful consideration  of defense counsel's  arguments,\n\nhowever, the  district court exercised its  discretion not to\n\ndepart  because it  found  that the  \"defendant does  fit the\n\nclassic   pattern  for   career  offender   status.\"     This\n\ndiscretionary decision is unappealable.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nAmparo,  961 F.2d 288, 292  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 113 S.\r                                                                 \n\nCt. 224 (1992) (appeal  will not lie from a  district court's\n\nrefusal to depart from a properly calculated sentencing range\n\nunless  the   decision  stemmed  from  the  court's  mistaken\n\nimpression  that   it  lacked   the  authority   to  depart).\n\nAccordingly, the case is dismissed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                                    \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.
