The question  before us\n                                   \n\nis   whether  the  district  court,  under  its  inherent  or\n\nsupervisory powers, properly  ordered an attorney to  pay the\n\ncourt reporter for a trial transcript.  We conclude the order\n\nmust be reversed.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Appellant is an attorney who represented a claimant\n\nin a forfeiture action.  At  the close of the 13-day non-jury\n\ntrial in that  case, the court asked the  reporter to prepare\n\nthe  transcript on  an expedited  basis  so that  the parties\n\ncould  use it  in preparing  post-trial  memoranda.   Several\n\nmonths  later, before  the district  court  had rendered  any\n\ndecision,  appellant moved to withdraw explaining that he had\n\nbeen unable to  communicate with his client, he  had not been\n\npaid for  his services, and  the client had not  produced the\n\nfunds  for the trial  transcript.   The district  court judge\n\nissued an  order holding the  motion to withdraw  in abeyance\n\nuntil new counsel  filed an appearance.   Three weeks  later,\n\nthe  court  reporter  asked  the  court  to  order  appellant\n\npersonally  to pay  $4,519 for  the trial  transcript he  had\n\nordered,  but  not  yet  picked  up.    Appellant  filed   no\n\nopposition to the court reporter's  motion, and a month later\n\nthe judge  issued an order  requesting appellant  to pay  the\n\n                             -2-\n\nreporter within the week.1   The same day, the judge rendered\n\nhis  decision  in   the  forfeiture  action,  found   against\n\nappellant's  client, and ordered the articles destroyed.  The\n\nnext month, the court reporter said she had not been paid and\n\nasked the  court to enforce  its August 19 order.   Appellant\n\nopposed  and sought reconsideration  of the August  19 order.\n\nHe explained that the transcript  had been ordered on  behalf\n\nof his client,  but he had been unable to  collect either his\n\nown fee or  the transcript amount.  Moreover,  he argued that\n\nthe  court lacked jurisdiction  over him with  respect to the\n\ndemand for payment.\n\n          The    district    court    rejected    appellant's\n\njurisdictional argument, explaining,  without citation to any\n\nauthority, as follows:\n\n          The Court's power to order an attorney to\n          pay for stenographic transcripts which he\n          has  ordered  from   the  official  court\n          reporter   stems    from   the    summary\n          jurisdiction  possessed  by  courts  over\n          attorneys as their  officers.  The courts\n          have  always  possessed  jurisdiction  to\n          compel an attorney to observe the  duties\n          incident  to  his  professional relations\n          towards  his  clients,  and  towards  the\n          other  officers of  the Court,  including\n          court  reporters.  It  is a court's right\n\n                    \n\n1.  The order, dated August 19, 1992, read as follows:\n\n          Order  to  Att.  Harry  Anduze --  Please\n          proceed to  pay Mrs. Barbara  Dachman the\n          sum  of  $4,519.00  for her  services  as\n          requested  in  motion   subject  of  this\n          order.   Payment  should be  made  on  or\n          before August 26, 1992.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          and duty to supervise attorneys and court\n          reporters in their  actions pertaining to\n          matters concerning litigation  before the\n          court, as they are  both officers of  the\n          court.  Thus, the  Court has jurisdiction\n          over attorney  Anduze even though  he has\n          not been served with process.\n\nUnited States v. 789 Cases  of Latex Surgeons' Gloves, 826 F.\n                                                     \n\nSupp. 589, 590 (D.P.R. 1993).  With regard to the merits, the\n\ncourt  acknowledged  the  existence of  contrary  views,  but\n\nadopted the following rule:\n\n          [T]he Court believes that  in the absence\n          of express notice to the contrary,  court\n          officials and  persons connected,  either\n          directly or indirectly  with the progress\n          of   litigation,   may    safely   regard\n          themselves as dealing  with the attorney,\n          rather than with the client. . . .  There\n          is nothing  unfair about  this rule,  the\n          Court agrees  with [Monick  v. Melnicoff,\n                                                  \n          144  A.2d 381 (D.C.  Mun. Ct. App. 1958)]\n          in that:\n\n               If  an attorney  in ordering  a\n               transcript or a  brief does not\n               intend    to    bind    himself\n               personally,   he   may    avoid\n               responsibility  by  making  his\n               position clear.  The reporter .\n               .  .  then  on  notice  of  the\n               nonliability  of the  attorney,\n               may take such steps as he feels\n               are    necessary    for     his\n               protection   before   extending\n               credit to a client whose credit\n               standing and responsibility are\n               often wholly unknown to him.\n\n789 Cases,  826 F. Supp.  at 590-91.  While  neither side had\n         \n\ncited any Puerto Rico law  on the subject, the court  did not\n\ndetermine   how  a  Puerto   Rico  court  would   decide  the\n\ncontractual dispute because  it believed the matter  could be\n\n                             -4-\n\n\"resolved independently of  local law,\" id., at 590  n.3, and\n                                           \n\nit ordered appellant to pay the court reporter.2\n\n          Appellant  has now appealed  from the May  12, 1993\n\npayment order.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          We  deal first with a jurisdictional question.  The\n\ncourt reporter argues no timely appeal from the final payment\n\norder has been filed and  hence we should dismiss the appeal.\n\nShe contends that  the payment order  was the court's  August\n\n19,  1992 order quoted  in note one,  that appellant's motion\n\nfor reconsideration,  filed on  September 22,  1992 past  the\n\nperiod provided in Rule 59(e), would not have tolled the time\n\nfor appealing from  the August 19, 1992 under  the version of\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) in effect prior  to December 1, 1993;\n\nand that appellant's  May 24, 1993 notice of  appeal from the\n\ncourt's  May  12,  1993  order  denying  reconsideration  and\n\nordering payment does not bring before us the August 19, 1992\n\norder.    Under  the principle  that  a  post-judgment motion\n\nasking  the court to change its disposition solely because of\n                                                  \n\nlegal  error must  be  brought under  Rule  59(e) within  the\n\nrule's  10-day  period, Rodriquez-Antuna  v.  Chase Manhattan\n                                                             \n\nBank Corp., 871 F.2d  1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (dispute  over how\n          \n\n                    \n\n2.  We point  out that  we take no  position on  the question\nwhether the substantive rule of  decision in a case like this\nderives from  federal or state  law.  See Mathewson  Corp. v.\n                                                          \nAllied Marine Indus.,  Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 853  n.3 (1st Cir.\n                           \n1987).\n\n                             -5-\n\nstatute  of limitations  should  be  computed not  cognizable\n\nunder Rule 60(b));  Silk v. Sandoval, 435  F.2d 1266, 1267-68\n                                    \n\n(1st Cir.) (\"If  the court merely wrongly decides  a point of\n\nlaw,  that  is  not  `inadvertence,  surprise,  or  excusable\n\nneglect'\" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1)), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n402 U.S. 1012 (1971), the appeal from the May  12, 1993 order\n\nwould avail appellant nothing, the argument would continue.\n\n          We disagree for two reasons.  First, the August 19,\n\n1992 order was arguably precatory.  It did not clearly direct\n\npayment,  but  rather  asked  appellant  to  please  pay  the\n\nreporter, a phrasing which may  have led appellant to believe\n\nthe  directive did  not carry  the  force of  a normal  court\n\norder.   Second,  Rodriquez-Antuna  does  not  apply  because\n                                  \n\nappellant did not simply argue that the August 19, 1992 order\n\nwas infected by  error of substantive law.  Rather, appellant\n\nadvanced a  non-frivolous argument  that the  order was  void\n\nbecause the court lacked jurisdiction to order him to pay the\n\ncourt reporter, a matter  the district court had  not earlier\n\naddressed.   Under these circumstances, we conclude that even\n\nif the August 19, 1992 order was a final judgment  from which\n\nan immediate appeal could have been filed, appellant's motion\n\nfor reconsideration was properly  entertainable under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b).  As appellant filed a timely notice of  appeal\n\nfrom the court's  May 12, 1993 order  denying reconsideration\n\nand ordering appellant to pay the court reporter, we deny the\n\n                             -6-\n\ncourt reporter's  motion to  dismiss and  motion for  further\n\nbriefing time and proceed to the merits.\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n          Some courts,  applying agency  principles, conclude\n\nan  attorney is not liable for  litigation expenses absent an\n\nexpress  or  implied  undertaking to  be  bound,  while other\n\ncourts  treat the attorney,  rather than  the client,  as the\n\nprincipal  and impose  liability on  the  attorney absent  an\n\nexpress disclaimer  of responsibility.   See  Jay M.  Zitter,\n                                            \n\nAnnotation,  Attorney's   Personal  Liability   for  Expenses\n                                                             \n\nIncurred in  Relation to Services  for Client, 66  A.L.R. 4th\n                                             \n\n256,  262  (1988)   (surveying  the  variety   of  approaches\n\nfollowed).  Here the district court purported to exercise its\n\nsupervisory powers to devise a uniform rule to be followed in\n\nthe federal district court in Puerto Rico and applied the new\n\nrule   to  conduct   pre-dating   the  rule's   announcement.\n\nRegardless of  whether federal or state law supplies the rule\n\nof  decision (a  matter on which  we do not  opine, see supra\n                                                             \n\nn.2), and regardless  of which of the surveyed  approaches to\n\nan attorney's  payment responsibility  represents the  better\n\nview, we think the district court's handling of the situation\n\ndid not satisfy the demands of fundamental fairness.\n\n          The  situation  is  similar  to that  presented  in\n\nBoettcher  v.  Hartford Ins.  Group,  927 F.2d  23  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1991).  There, the district court invoked its inherent powers\n\n                             -7-\n\nto impose jury costs on a plaintiff and her attorney who  had\n\nsettled on the morning of trial after jurors had reported for\n\nduty.   No  local rule  provided for  jury costs  under those\n\ncircumstances,  and  counsel  had  had  no  notice  prior  to\n\nsettling that jury  costs would be imposed.   We reversed the\n\nsanction because it was unfair for the court to  use the case\n\nas  the first step  in adopting a  new rule.   The \"[l]ack of\n\nfair notice  is fatal to  [the court's] exercise  of inherent\n\npower . .  ..  The law forbids  the imposition of a  new rule\n\nwithout prior notice,\" we explained.  Id. at 26.\n                                         \n\n          We think the same is true here.  The district court\n\nhas no written local rule imposing liability on attorneys for\n\ntranscripts they order,3 and hence  the court should not have\n\ninvoked  its  inherent  powers  to  resolve  the  \"transcript\n\npayment\" dispute summarily.\n\n          The May 12,  1993 order directing appellant  to pay\n\nthe court reporter is reversed.\n                              \n\n                    \n\n3.  We do  not purport to pass upon  the validity of any such\nrule, were one to  be adopted.  Similarly, we  do not express\nany view on  what remedial avenues remain open  to the unpaid\ncourt reporter.\n\n                             -8-\n",

The court reporter argues no timely appeal from the final payment order has been filed and hence we should dismiss the appeal.  She contends that the payment order was the court's August 19, 1992 order quoted in note one, that appellant's motion for reconsideration, filed on September 22, 1992 past the period provided in Rule 59(e), would not have tolled the time for appealing from the August 19, 1992 under the version of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) in effect prior to December 1, 1993;  and that appellant's May 24, 1993 notice of appeal from the court's May 12, 1993 order denying reconsideration and ordering payment does not bring before us the August 19, 1992 order.  Under the principle that a post-judgment motion asking the court to change its disposition solely because of legal error must be brought under Rule 59(e) within the rule's 10-day period,  Rodriquez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1989) (dispute over how statute of limitations should be computed not cognizable under Rule 60(b));   Silk v. Sandoval, 435 F.2d 1266, 1267-68 (1st Cir.)

First, the August 19, 1992 order was arguably precatory.  It did not clearly direct payment, but rather asked appellant to please pay the reporter, a phrasing which may have led appellant to believe the directive did not carry the force of a normal court order.  Second, Rodriquez-Antuna does not apply because appellant did not simply argue that the August 19, 1992 order was infected by error of substantive law.  Rather, appellant advanced a non-frivolous argument that the order was void because the court lacked jurisdiction to order him to pay the court reporter, a matter the district court had not earlier addressed.  Under these circumstances, we conclude that even if the August 19, 1992 order was a final judgment from which an immediate appeal could have been filed, appellant's motion for reconsideration was properly entertainable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  As appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the court's May 12, 1993 order denying reconsideration and ordering appellant to pay the court reporter, we deny the court reporter's motion to dismiss and motion for further briefing time and proceed to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts, applying agency principles, conclude an attorney is not liable for litigation expenses absent an express or implied undertaking to be bound, while other courts treat the attorney, rather than the client, as the principal and impose liability on the attorney absent an express disclaimer of responsibility.

Here the district court purported to exercise its supervisory powers to devise a uniform rule to be followed in the federal district court in Puerto Rico and applied the new rule to conduct predating the rule's announcement.  Regardless of whether federal or state law supplies the rule of decision (a matter on which we do not opine, see supra n. 2), and regardless of which of the surveyed approaches to an attorney's payment responsibility represents the better view, we think the district court's handling of the situation did not satisfy the demands of fundamental fairness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is similar to that presented in  Boettcher v.

There, the district court invoked its inherent powers to impose jury costs on a plaintiff and her attorney who had settled on the morning of trial after jurors had reported for duty.  No local rule provided for jury costs under those circumstances, and counsel had had no notice prior to settling that jury costs would be imposed.  We reversed the sanction because it was unfair for the court to use the case as the first step in adopting a new rule.

At the close of the 13-day non-jury trial in that case, the court asked the reporter to prepare the transcript on an expedited basis so that the parties could use it in preparing post-trial memoranda.  Several months later, before the district court had rendered any decision, appellant moved to withdraw explaining that he had been unable to communicate with his client, he had not been paid for his services, and the client had not produced the funds for the trial transcript.  The district court judge issued an order holding the motion to withdraw in abeyance until new counsel filed an appearance.  Three weeks later, the court reporter asked the court to order appellant personally to pay $4,519 for the trial transcript he had ordered, but not yet picked up.  Appellant filed no opposition to the court reporter's motion, and a month later the judge issued an order requesting appellant to pay the reporter within the week.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The same day, the judge rendered his decision in the forfeiture action, found against appellant's client, and ordered the articles destroyed.  The next month, the court reporter said she had not been paid and asked the court to enforce its August 19 order.  Appellant opposed and sought reconsideration of the August 19 order.  He explained that the transcript had been ordered on behalf of his client, but he had been unable to collect either his own fee or the transcript amount.  Moreover, he argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over him with respect to the demand for payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected appellant's jurisdictional argument, explaining, without citation to any authority, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The Court's power to order an attorney to pay for stenographic transcripts which he has ordered from the official court reporter stems from the summary jurisdiction possessed by courts over attorneys as their officers.  The courts have always possessed jurisdiction to compel an attorney to observe the duties incident to his professional relations towards his clients, and towards the other officers of the Court, including court reporters.  It is a court's right and duty to supervise attorneys and court reporters in their actions pertaining to matters concerning litigation before the court, as they are both officers of the court.
