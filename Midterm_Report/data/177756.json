Christopher Parker appeals from a\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) decision affirming a bankruptcy\n\ncourt order denying his motion for relief from stay.        Parker's\n\nobjective is to reopen a Maine state court proceeding against\n\nMichelle J. Handy brought pursuant to Maine's version of the\n\nUniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA).      Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14,\n\n§ 3571 et seq.   During the state court proceeding, Handy filed for\n\nbankruptcy, staying Parker's state action against her.\n\n          Parker filed a motion in bankruptcy court for relief from\n\nstay.   Handy received discharge during a hearing, which included\n\nParker's motion.    At the time of discharge, Parker had obtained\n\nneither a favorable judgment from the state court, nor a lien\n\nagainst Handy's property. The bankruptcy court held that 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 524(a)(2) precludes Parker from pursuing his action against\n\nHandy, and the BAP affirmed.    We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Parker sued Handy in a Maine state district court,\n\nalleging that Handy purchased a residence with funds conveyed to\n\nher by her ex-husband in violation of the UFTA.      He sought both\n\nmoney damages and the imposition of a constructive trust on the\n\nresidence.   Parker also filed a lis pendens, but he has abandoned\n\nthe claim that this created a lien on the residence.      The state\n\ncourt entered judgement for Handy, and Parker timely appealed to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthe Maine Supreme Judicial Court. His appeal was stayed when Handy\n\nfiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.\n\n           Promulgated in 1984, the UFTA seeks \"to protect the\n\ndebtor's   estate    from   being   depleted       to    the   prejudice     of   the\n\ndebtor's unsecured creditors.\"         UFTA § 3, cmt. 2; In re Jackson,\n\n459 F.3d 117, 121 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006).              It forbids a debtor from\n\nmaking two types of transfers: (1) those \"with actual intent to\n\nhinder, delay, or defraud any creditor\" and (2) those in which the\n\ndebtor does not receive a \"reasonably equivalent value in exchange\"\n\nin light of his financial circumstances.                UFTA § 4(a).\n\n           In his state court action, Parker alleged that Handy\n\nreceived funds in a forbidden transfer of the first type.                     On or\n\nabout April 10, 2003, Parker obtained a judgment against Handy's\n\nex-husband, Walter Loeman.          Parker did not receive payment.                He\n\nalleged that while Handy and Loeman were still married, Handy\n\npurchased a residence with the assistance of $26,410.12 in funds\n\nfrom Loeman.      Under the UFTA, the presence of \"actual intent\" to\n\ndefraud a creditor may be assessed in light of whether the transfer\n\nwas to an \"insider\" like a \"relative of the debtor.\"                              UFTA\n\n§§ 4(b)(1); 1(7)(i)(A).\n\n           With his state court appeal stayed, Parker filed a motion\n\nin   bankruptcy    court    for   relief    from   stay.        Under   11   U.S.C.\n\n§ 524(a)(2), a discharge from bankruptcy operates as an injunction\n\nagainst in personam claims against a debtor.                   Parker argued that\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhis requested relief in state court included an order of sale of\n\nHandy's residence and that \"[t]o this extent,\" his claim against\n\nHandy was a claim in rem.        He asserted that Handy's discharge in\n\nbankruptcy would not affect this in rem claim even though he was an\n\nunsecured creditor.      Handy filed an objection, arguing that as an\n\nunsecured creditor Parker did not hold an in rem claim for purposes\n\nof 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2).\n\n              The bankruptcy court denied Parker's motion.         During the\n\ncourse of the proceedings, Handy received a discharge.             In an oral\n\ndecision, the bankruptcy court held that Parker could not proceed\n\nagainst Handy's property because he did not have a claim in rem.\n\nIt held that Parker had not established an interest in the property\n\nby either attachment or a provisional remedy. Parker's request for\n\na constructive trust, it held, did not give rise to a cause of\n\naction in rem.       The bankruptcy court also held that Parker had\n\nfailed   to    object   to   Handy's   invocation   of   Maine's   homestead\n\nexemption, and that as an unsecured creditor he could not pursue\n\nthat exempt property.\n\n              The BAP affirmed, rejecting Parker's arguments that (1)\n\nhe held an in rem claim because he had sought a constructive trust\n\nin his state court action, (2) he could pursue his claims post-\n\ndischarge even though he did not obtain an attachment prior to\n\nbankruptcy, and (3) he did not need to object to Handy's homestead\n\nclaim.   As to the first, the BAP reiterated the bankruptcy court's\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fholding that a constructive trust is a remedy, not a status.    As to\n\nthe second, it held that Parker cited no authority supporting his\n\ncontention that the Bankruptcy Code allows him to proceed post-\n\ndischarge.    As to the third, the BAP held that Parker could not\n\nproceed against the exempt property because he did not possess a\n\nclaim in rem.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           This court reviews appeals from the BAP under the same\n\nstandards of review as the BAP reviews appeals from the bankruptcy\n\ncourt.1   We review the bankruptcy court's legal conclusions de novo\n\nand its factual findings for clear error.     Fed R. Bankr. P. 7052\n\ncmt. 11; In re Marrama, 430 F.3d 474, 477 (1st Cir. 2005).     Parker\n\nraises the same purely legal questions before us that he raised\n\nbefore the BAP.\n\n           Parker first asserts that his state court action included\n\na cause of action in rem against Handy's residence.   He argues that\n\nclaims under the UFTA sound in rem and that an action that seeks to\n\nimpose a constructive trust is an in rem action.      In making this\n\nclaim, Parker relies upon Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877), for\n\nthe proposition that an action may confer in rem jurisdiction on a\n\ncourt even in the absence of a pre-judgment attachment of the\n\nproperty in question. Id. at 724 (citing Boswell's Lessee v. Otis,\n\n\n\n     1\n          Handy has failed to appear or file a brief on appeal. We\nallowed Parker's attorney to present oral argument, nonetheless.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f50 U.S. (9 How.) 336 (1850)).            He cites no Maine law in support of\n\nhis argument.\n\n            In Pennoyer, the Supreme Court held that an action in rem\n\nmay proceed when the property is brought under the court's control\n\neither by \"seizure or some equivalent act.\"                         95 U.S. at 727.\n\nSubsequent decisions have held that a court may not exercise\n\njurisdiction over an action quasi in rem absent an attachment or\n\ngarnishment.     Pennington v. Fourth Nat'l Bank, 243 U.S. 269, 272\n\n(1917).     In actions purely in rem, however, it appears that the\n\nrule in Pennoyer still applies.                    4A Wright & Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 1070, at 292 (3d ed. 2002).2\n\n            It does not follow that Parker has stated a claim in rem.\n\nHe    concedes   that     he    did    not    obtain    a   lien,    attachment,   or\n\nprovisional remedy.            He does not argue that the state district\n\ncourt exercised control over Handy's residence. Parker argues only\n\nthat he can maintain an in rem claim because he requested a\n\nconstructive trust.\n\n            No Maine case supports this argument and our view, like\n\nthat of the BAP, is that Parker's request for a constructive trust\n\ndid   not   of   itself    give       rise    to   a   cause   of   action   in   rem.\n\nConstructive trusts are not substantive rights that confer a cause\n\nof action; they are remedial devices employed by courts once\n\n\n\n       2\n          A preliminary seizure is unnecessary in suits that\nconcern a valid lien. Roller v. Holly, 176 U.S. 398, 405 (1900).\n\n                                             -6-\n\fliability is found and where equity requires.             See Yavuz v. 61 MM,\n\nLtd., 576 F.3d 1166, 1176 (10th Cir. 2009); Mayo v. Hartford Life\n\nIns. Co., 354 F.3d 400, 409 (5th Cir. 2004).             Without more, Parker\n\ncannot transform a request for a remedy in rem into a cause of\n\naction in rem. It follows that before Handy's bankruptcy petition,\n\nParker's unsuccessful claims against Handy were only in personam.\n\n           Next, Parker asserts that he may pursue his fraudulent\n\nconveyance claims post-discharge.           He makes two related arguments,\n\none summarily.         First, Parker claims that he retains a pre-\n\nbankruptcy claim in rem that survives the bankruptcy discharge\n\ninjunction     under    11   U.S.C.   §   524.      Second,   relying    on   a\n\nMassachusetts bankruptcy decision, In re Palumbo, 353 B.R. 37\n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 2006), Parker claims that an unsecured creditor\n\nmay   pursue   a   fraudulent   conveyance       claim   against   a   debtor's\n\nproperty post-discharge consistent with 11 U.S.C. § 524.\n\n           Both of these claims fail.            Parker's first claim fails\n\nbecause he did not hold an in rem claim pre-discharge.                 Parker's\n\nsecond claim is not properly before this court.             He did not raise\n\nit before the bankruptcy court, so he may not raise it on appeal.\n\nFish Mkt. Nominee Corp. v. Pelofsky 72 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nIn any event, this claim is doubly waived because Parker also\n\nfailed to adequately present it on appeal.                 United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).          Palumbo does not bind us,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fand Parker makes no argument as to why an unsecured creditor may\n\nproceed post-discharge consistent with 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2).\n\n            Finally, Parker asserts that the bankruptcy court erred\n\nin holding that he was obliged to object to Handy's claim of a\n\nhomestead exemption.     Because Parker does not possess a claim in\n\nrem against Handy's residence, this claim is also not properly\n\nbefore us.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            The   judgment   of   the   Bankruptcy   Appellate   Panel   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

During the state court proceeding, Handy filed for bankruptcy, staying Parker's state action against her.</p>\n<p>Parker filed a motion in bankruptcy court for relief from stay. Handy received discharge during a hearing, which included Parker's motion. At the time of discharge, Parker had obtained neither a favorable judgment from the state court, nor a lien against Handy's property. The bankruptcy court held that 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2) precludes Parker from pursuing his action against Handy, and the BAP affirmed. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Parker sued Handy in a Maine state district court, alleging that Handy purchased a residence with funds conveyed to her by her ex-husband in violation of the UFTA. He sought both money damages and the imposition of a constructive trust on the residence. Parker also filed a lis pendens, but he has abandoned the claim that this created a lien on the residence. The state court entered judgement for Handy, and Parker timely appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. His appeal was stayed when Handy filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.</p>\n<p>Promulgated in 1984, the UFTA seeks \"to protect the debtor's estate from being depleted to the prejudice of the debtor's unsecured creditors.\" UFTA § 3, cmt. 2; <i>In re Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202361\"><a href=\"/opinion/202361/dahar-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 121 n. 3 (1st Cir.2006). It forbids a debtor from making two types of transfers: (1) those \"with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor\" and (2) those in which the debtor does not receive a \"reasonably equivalent value in exchange\" in light of his financial circumstances. UFTA § 4(a).</p>\n<p>In his state court action, Parker alleged that Handy received funds in a forbidden transfer of the first type. On or about April 10, 2003, Parker obtained a judgment against Handy's ex-husband, Walter Loeman. Parker did not receive payment. He alleged that while Handy and Loeman were still married, Handy purchased a residence with the assistance of $26,410.12 in funds from Loeman. Under the UFTA, the presence of \"actual intent\" to defraud a creditor may be assessed in light of whether the transfer was to an \"insider\" like a \"relative of the debtor.\" UFTA §§ 4(b)(1); 1(7)(i)(A).</p>\n<p>With his state court appeal stayed, Parker filed a motion in bankruptcy court for relief from stay. Under 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2), a discharge from bankruptcy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> operates as an injunction against in personam claims against a debtor. Parker argued that his requested relief in state court included an order of sale of Handy's residence and that \"[t]o this extent,\" his claim against Handy was a claim in rem. He asserted that Handy's discharge in bankruptcy would not affect this in rem claim even though he was an unsecured creditor. Handy filed an objection, arguing that as an unsecured creditor Parker did not hold an in rem claim for purposes of 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2).</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court denied Parker's motion. During the course of the proceedings, Handy received a discharge. In an oral decision, the bankruptcy court held that Parker could not proceed against Handy's property because he did not have a claim in rem. It held that Parker had not established an interest in the property by either attachment or a provisional remedy. Parker's request for a constructive trust, it held, did not give rise to a cause of action in rem. The bankruptcy court also held that Parker had failed to object to Handy's invocation of Maine's homestead exemption, and that as an unsecured creditor he could not pursue that exempt property.</p>\n<p>The BAP affirmed, rejecting Parker's arguments that (1) he held an in rem claim because he had sought a constructive trust in his state court action, (2) he could pursue his claims post-discharge even though he did not obtain an attachment prior to bankruptcy, and (3) he did not need to object to Handy's homestead claim. As to the first, the BAP reiterated the bankruptcy court's holding that a constructive trust is a remedy, not a status. As to the second, it held that Parker cited no authority supporting his contention that the Bankruptcy Code allows him to proceed post-discharge. As to the third, the BAP held that Parker could not proceed against the exempt property because he did not possess a claim in rem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This court reviews appeals from the BAP under the same standards of review as the BAP reviews appeals from the bankruptcy court.<sup>[1]</sup> We review the bankruptcy court's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7052 cmt. 11; <i>In re Marrama,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span>, 477 (1st Cir.2005). Parker raises the same purely legal questions before us that he raised before the BAP.</p>\n<p>Parker first asserts that his state court action included a cause of action in rem against Handy's residence. He argues that claims under the UFTA sound in rem and that an action that seeks to impose a constructive trust is an in rem action. In making this claim, Parker relies upon <i>Pennoyer v. Neff,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span> (1877), for the proposition that an action may confer in rem jurisdiction on a court even in the absence of a pre-judgment attachment of the property in question. <i>Id.</i> at 724 (citing <i>Boswell's Lessee v. Otis,</i> 50 U.S. (9 How.) 336, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86564\"><a href=\"/opinion/86564/boswells-lessee-v-otis/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span> (1850)). He cites no Maine law in support of his argument.</p>\n<p>In <i>Pennoyer,</i> the Supreme Court held that an action in rem may proceed when the property is brought under the court's control either by \"seizure or some equivalent act.\" 95 U.S. at 727. Subsequent decisions have held that a court may not exercise jurisdiction over an action quasi in rem absent an attachment or garnishment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> <i>Pennington v. Fourth Nat'l Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98895\"><a href=\"/opinion/98895/pennington-v-fourth-nat-bank-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 272, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98895\"><a href=\"/opinion/98895/pennington-v-fourth-nat-bank-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98895\"><a href=\"/opinion/98895/pennington-v-fourth-nat-bank-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span> (1917). In actions purely in rem, however, it appears that the rule in <i>Pennoyer</i> still applies. 4A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1070, at 292 (3d ed. 2002).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>It does not follow that Parker has stated a claim in rem. He concedes that he did not obtain a lien, attachment, or provisional remedy. He does not argue that the state district court exercised control over Handy's residence. Parker argues only that he can maintain an in rem claim because he requested a constructive trust.</p>\n<p>No Maine case supports this argument and our view, like that of the BAP, is that Parker's request for a constructive trust did not of itself give rise to a cause of action in rem. Constructive trusts are not substantive rights that confer a cause of action; they are remedial devices employed by courts once liability is found and where equity requires. <i>See </i><i>Yavuz v. 61 MM, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172533\"><a href=\"/opinion/172533/yavuz-v-61-mm-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span>, 1176 (10th Cir. 2009); <i>Mayo v. Hartford Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"33768\"><a href=\"/opinion/33768/mayo-v-hartford-life-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 409 (5th Cir.2004). Without more, Parker cannot transform a request for a remedy in rem into a cause of action in rem. It follows that before Handy's bankruptcy petition, Parker's unsuccessful claims against Handy were only in personam.</p>\n<p>Next, Parker asserts that he may pursue his fraudulent conveyance claims post-discharge. He makes two related arguments, one summarily. First, Parker claims that he retains a pre-bankruptcy claim in rem that survives the bankruptcy discharge injunction under 11 U.S.C. § 524. Second, relying on a Massachusetts bankruptcy decision, <i>In re Palumbo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1547577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1547577/in-re-palumbo/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.Mass.2006), Parker claims that an unsecured creditor may pursue a fraudulent conveyance claim against a debtor's property post-discharge consistent with 11 U.S.C. § 524.</p>\n<p>Both of these claims fail. Parker's first claim fails because he did not hold an in rem claim pre-discharge. Parker's second claim is not properly before this court. He did not raise it before the bankruptcy court, so he may not raise it on appeal. <i>Fish Mkt. Nominee Corp. v. Pelofsky</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196487\"><a href=\"/opinion/196487/fish-market-v-childress/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1995). In any event, this claim is doubly waived because Parker also failed to adequately present it on appeal. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). <i>Palumbo</i> does not bind us, and Parker makes no argument as to why an unsecured creditor may proceed post-discharge consistent with 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Finally, Parker asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that he was obliged to object to Handy's claim of a homestead exemption. Because Parker does not possess a claim in rem against Handy's residence, this claim is also not properly before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Handy has failed to appear or file a brief on appeal. We allowed Parker's attorney to present oral argument, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>[2]  A preliminary seizure is unnecessary in suits that concern a valid lien. <i>Roller v.
