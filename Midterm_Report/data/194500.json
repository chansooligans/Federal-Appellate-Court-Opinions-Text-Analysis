Consequently, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the\n\nbranch of the United States Department of Agriculture responsible\n\nfor  overseeing  the  food  stamp  program,  imposed  a  punitive\n\nsanction.\n\n          Massachusetts unsuccessfully appealed  the sanction  to\n\nthe Food Stamp Appeal Board (the Board).  It then sought judicial\n\nreview in federal  district court.  See  7 U.S.C.   2023  (1982).\n                                       \n\nThe  court granted summary judgment in  favor of the defendants,1\n\nalbeit in two steps.   See Massachusetts v. United States, 737 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  120 (D.

Mass. 1992)  (Massachusetts\n                                                                 \n\nII).\n  \n\n          Finding the penalty  hard to swallow, the  Commonwealth\n\nserves  up a  gallimaufry  of issues  for appellate  mastication.\n\nAlthough these issues  contain some food  for thought, they  lack\n\ntrue  nutritive  value.   Consequently,  we  affirm the  judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.  FACTUAL PRELUDE\n\n          Congress designed the Food Stamp  Act of 1964, Pub.  L.\n\n                    \n\n     1The Commonwealth named a host  of federal defendants in its\nsuit, including the United  States, the Secretary of Agriculture,\nthe Department  of Agriculture, the Board, and  FNS.  For ease in\nreference,  we treat the appeal as if the appellees were a single\nentity.\n\n                                2\n\nNo. 88-525, 78 Stat. 103 (1964), codified as amended, 7 U.S.C.   \n                                                    \n\n2011-2030 (1982),  to provide low-income families  with access to\n\ngovernment-subsidized  foodstuffs.    Although the  coupons  were\n\nactually disbursed  by the  participating states, FNS  paid fifty\n\npercent  of the administrative  costs and one  hundred percent of\n\nthe  food  subsidy  costs.   In  time,  the  federal government's\n\ngenerosity   produced   an  unfortunate   side   effect;  because\n\noverpayments were charged  to the federal tab, states  had little\n\nincentive  to  keep   distributions  in  line.     To  curb  this\n\nprofligacy, Congress eventually enacted a quality control program\n\n(QCP) to ensure more accurate food stamp distribution.  The first\n\nQCP took effect  in 1977.  Pub. L. No. 95-113,   16, 91 Stat. 976\n\n(1977).\n\n          From that point forward, Congress persistently tinkered\n\nwith the QCP's features.   During FY 1982, the  QCP required that\n\neach state  survey a sample of  its food stamp cases  in order to\n\nestimate  in what percentage of them it had distributed the wrong\n\nnumber  of food stamps.  After receiving the states' tallies, FNS\n\nwould set a target error rate (the TER), take a subsample of each\n\nstate's  cases, recheck  them for  errors, and  employ regression\n\nanalysis  to blend the federal and state estimates of state error\n\nrates into a single estimated error rate (the EER) for the state.\n\nSee 7 U.S.C.A.   2025(g) (West Supp. 1981); 94 Stat. 363  (1980);\n   \n\nsee also  7 C.F.R.    275.25(d)(6)  (1982).   If the state's  EER\n        \n\nsurpassed the TER, as  determined by FNS, the  federal government\n\n                                3\n\nimposed a  monetary sanction.2    Such fines  were calculated  by\n\nmultiplying the  total dollar  value of state-issued  food stamps\n\nfor  the fiscal year times the difference between the state's EER\n\nand  its TER.  See 7 C.F.R.    275.25(d)(3) (1982).  If, however,\n                  \n\nthe  state's EER  was below  five percent,  the state  received a\n\nbonus:   the federal government increased its contribution to the\n\nprogram's  administrative  costs  from  fifty  percent  to  sixty\n\npercent.  See 7 C.F.R.   275.25(c)(2)(i) (1982).\n             \n\n          In  FY  1982,  FNS  set Massachusetts's  TER  at  14.88\n\npercent.   After the two sovereigns completed  their sampling and\n\nresolved some mathematical bevues by negotiation, FNS figured the\n\nEER  to be  roughly  16.35 percent  and,  accordingly, fined  the\n\nCommonwealth $1,323,864.   The penalty survived  scrutiny by both\n\nthe Board and the district court.\n\n          In  this  appeal,  Massachusetts makes  four  principal\n\nclaims:  (1)  that the  quality control provisions  on which  the\n\nsanction rested were  no longer  in effect when  FNS imposed  the\n\nsanction; (2) that FNS's sampling methodology was so biased as to\n\noffend  the Food  Stamp Act; (3)  that FNS's  use of  too large a\n\nsample skewed the results; and (4) that FNS erred in  refusing to\n\ngrant  a good-cause  waiver.   We  treat  these asseverations  in\n\nsequence.\n\nII.  LACK OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY\n\n          Massachusetts and the amici join in urging that FNS had\n\n                    \n\n     2We discuss  infra Part  IV the circumstances  in which  the\n                       \nimposition of a monetary sanction might be waived.\n\n                                4\n\nno  authority  to levy  sanctions  for FY  1982  because Congress\n\nrepealed the QCP  effective October  1, 1982.   This claim  stems\n\nfrom  passage of  the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation  Act (OBRA),\n\nPub.  L. No. 97-253, 96 Stat. 763 (1982), enacted in September of\n\n1982.   OBRA completely revamped the Food Stamp Act's approach to\n\nquality   control.    The  legislation  repealed  the  previously\n\nexisting QCP and  fashioned a  new regimen  effective October  1,\n\n1982 (the first  day of  FY 1983).   Massachusetts contends  that\n\nthis   legislative   legerdemain   undermined   FNS's   authority\n\nthereafter to impose sanctions for FY 1982.3\n\n          It is a hoary rule of the common law that the repeal of\n\na statute  eliminates any inchoate liability  for penalties under\n\nthe repealed statute.  See, e.g., United States v. Reisinger, 128\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 398, 401 (1888).  In order to ameliorate this rule, Congress\n\npassed a general savings statute providing in pertinent part that\n\nthe \"repeal of  any statute shall not have the  effect to release\n\nor  extinguish  any penalty,  forfeiture,  or  liability incurred\n\nunder such statute . . . .\"  1 U.S.C.   109 (1982).  On its face,\n\nsection 109 seems adequate to preserve the authority by which FNS\n\npurposed to sanction the Commonwealth.\n\n          In  an  effort to  escape  the  savings statute's  web,\n\nMassachusetts  notes that  the QCP  allowed waivers  of liability\n\n                    \n\n     3Since  we  can  find  no  indication  in  the  record  that\nMassachusetts raised this issue before the Board, the point is at\nleast  arguably waived.    But, because  the  issue goes  to  the\nBoard's jurisdiction and because  the appellees have not advanced\na claim of waiver,  we choose to address it,  notwithstanding the\npossible incidence of procedural default.\n\n                                5\n\npremised on subsequent corrective measures.  See, e.g., 7  C.F.R.\n                                                      \n\n  275.25(d)(5)  (1982).   From this datum,  Massachusetts deduces\n\nthat it could not  have \"incurred\" liability until such  a waiver\n\nwas  denied    an event  which took place  well after  October 1,\n\n1982.  The  court below  found this argument  unpersuasive.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts II, 788 F. Supp.  at 1269 n.3. So do we.   The mere\n                \n\nfact that Congress grants  an agent the power to  waive sanctions\n\ndoes not  turn back the  clock and  eradicate the reality  of the\n\nunderlying violation.  Thus, we  do not believe Congress intended\n\nthat liability would  be deemed \"incurred\"  under federal law,  1\n\nU.S.C.      109,   only  when   all  opportunities   for  special\n\ndispensations had been exhausted and a previously imposed penalty\n\nhad  become irreversible.  See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. v. Federal\n                                                                 \n\nEnergy  Admin., 612  F.2d 1291,  1294 n.3  (Temp. Emer.  Ct. App.\n              \n\n1979)  (explaining why  costs  should be  deemed \"incurred\"  even\n\nbefore the amount has become certain).  Rather, we think Congress\n\nintended  that states incur liability for their food stamp errors\n\nat the conclusion of the  six-month monitoring period, 7 U.S.C.A.\n\n  2025(g)(1)  (West Supp. 1981)    a period which, in  this case,\n\nended September 30, 1982.\n\n          We have two main reasons for interpreting the interface\n\nbetween the Food Stamp  Act and the savings statute in  this way.\n\nIn  the first place, it appears well established that the savings\n\nstatute  was designed to prevent  exactly the sort  of lapse that\n\nMassachusetts argues occurred here.   See, e.g., Hamm v.  City of\n                                                                 \n\nRock  Hill, 379 U.S. 306, 314 (1964) (\"The federal saving statute\n          \n\n                                6\n\n. . . was meant to obviate mere technical abatement such as . . .\n\na  substitution of  a  new statute  with  a greater  schedule  of\n\npenalties . .  . .\"); United States v. Holley,  818 F.2d 351, 353\n                                             \n\n(5th Cir.  1987)  (similar).   Reading  the  savings  statute  to\n\nrelease from liability any party who had not yet exhausted after-\n\nthe-fact remediation would hamper  the law's goal, contravene the\n\nSupreme Court's  longstanding interpretation  of how the  statute\n\nshould  be applied,  and encourage  violators to  petition willy-\n\nnilly for  discretionary administrative  relief in the  hope that\n\nthe statutory scheme might be changed betweentimes.\n\n          In the second place, the statutory structure predicates\n\nwaiver on precedent liability.  See 7 U.S.C.A.   2025(g)(1) (West\n                                   \n\nSupp. 1981) (providing that, under the Food Stamp Act's liability\n\nprogram, an offending state shall pay the imposed fine unless the\n\nSecretary determines that good  cause exists for waiver).   We do\n\nnot  think  Congress  placed the  cart  to  the  horse's rear  by\n\naccident.  Had  Congress wished waiver considerations to  be part\n\nand parcel  of a  liability determination,  it would  simply have\n\nwritten the Food Stamp Act to premise liability on the absence of\n\nthose  factors that  allow  the granting  of good-cause  waivers.\n\nCongress chose to structure the statute differently, however, and\n\nwe must honor its  bipartite design in our interpretation.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Ingersoll-Rand  Co.  v.  McClendon, 111  S.  Ct.  478, 482\n                                         \n\n(1990); Greenwood Trust Co.  v. Massachusetts, 971 F.2d 818,  824\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3478 (U.S. 1993).\n                             \n\n          We  note, too, that  legislative statements surrounding\n\n                                7\n\nthe  1982 repeal of the QCP, while admittedly less than pellucid,\n\nindicate no  discernable intent to exonerate  states for pre-1983\n\nadministrative  errors.   Quite  the opposite:   the  legislative\n\nhistory suggests  Congress intended to increase  the certainty of\n\npenalties beginning  with FY  1983.   See S.  Rep. No.  504, 97th\n                                         \n\nCong., 2d Sess. 70-71, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1641, 1708-\n                                   \n\n09:\n\n          [T]he . . . major flaw in the existing system\n          [is  that] [t]he  current penalty  . .  . has\n          proven difficult to apply in practice because\n          of the relatively large amounts involved and,\n          as a result,  the Secretary has  [frequently]\n          chosen  to   waive  its  application.     The\n          sanctions established [by the new  statute] .\n          . . should not  be waived except when unusual\n          circumstances intervene.\n\nGiven this purpose,  it seems unlikely that Congress intended the\n\n1982 repeal  to preclude  enforcement of the  earlier regulations\n\nfor 1981  and 1982  in instances  where  good-cause reviews  were\n\nimminent or ongoing, but had not yet been decided.\n\n          For these reasons,  we reject the Commonwealth's  claim\n\nthat FNS  lacked statutory authority  to impose the  sanctions in\n\nquestion.\n\nIII.  STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY\n\n          Having   confirmed  the   vitality   of  the   sanction\n\nprovision,  we turn  next  to  the Commonwealth's  double-jointed\n\nchallenge  to  the  statistical methodology  that  FNS  employed.\n\nBefore  reaching Massachusetts's  two  substantive arguments,  we\n\nthink  it  is  useful to  explicate  the  applicable standard  of\n\njudicial review.\n\n                                8\n\n                     A.

See Broad St. Food Mkt., Inc. v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n720 F.2d 217, 220 (1st Cir. 1983); Collazo v.

The\n                                       \n\nquestion  in the  instant case  is more  complex because  the two\n\nparts of the calculus   liability and sanctions   are imbricated:\n\nFNS's determination  that  Massachusetts's EER  was  unacceptably\n\nhigh essentially determined both the Commonwealth's liability and\n                                \n\nthe  amount  of  the   resultant  sanction.    See  7   C.F.R.   \n                                                  \n\n275.25(d)(3) (1982) (explicated supra pp. 3-4).\n                                     \n\n          Notwithstanding  this  conflation   of  liability   and\n\nremediation,  a  reviewing court's  path  remains  clear.   Where\n\nliability  is  at issue,  section  2023(a)  requires that  courts\n\nreview administrative determinations de  novo.  If this statutory\n                                             \n\nbedrock is to  endure, inexorably mixed  issues of liability  and\n\nsanctions  must  likewise be  assessed de  novo,  even if  such a\n                                               \n\npenetrating standard  of judicial review intrudes  to some extent\n\ninto agency decisionmaking in the sanctions area.  Thus,  insofar\n\nas the Commonwealth's assignments of error implicate the validity\n\nof  the EER  and, therefore,  the amount  of the  penalty levied,\n\nplenary review is indicated.\n\n          We are quick to remark, however, that de novo review in\n                                                       \n\ncases  of this genre does not give  courts an entirely free hand.\n\nWhere, as here, the issues before the court  are legal in nature,\n\nde novo review of an administrative matter does not mean that the\n       \n\n                                10\n\ndistrict  court must  devise an  entirely new  regulatory scheme.\n\nRather, in  respect to  liability issues,  the court  must ensure\n\nthat the agency has  followed its own regulations and  that those\n\nregulations  do not  exceed the  scope of  the  agency's mandate.\n\nWith  these precepts in  mind, we now  address the Commonwealth's\n\nstatistical arguments.5\n\n                      B.  Statistical Bias.\n                                          \n\n          In order  to estimate Massachusetts's food  stamp error\n\nrate  and thereby  determine  what  (if  any) sanction  might  be\n\nappropriate,  FNS sampled  194  of the  Commonwealth's cases  for\n\ncompliance.  Massachusetts and the amici urge that the appellees'\n\nsampling  methodology  is  unlawful  because the  risk  of  error\n\ninherent in FNS's approximation is not evenly  shared between the\n\nstate  and the  federal  government.   Because FNS's  statistical\n\nmethod  effectively  determines the  Commonwealth's  liability as\n\nwell as the amount of  the sanction to be imposed, our  review of\n\nthe statistical bias claim is plenary.\n\n          We  start with  the  obvious:    FNS's sampling  is  no\n\ndifferent than any  other statistical sampling in  that it cannot\n\nproduce results that reflect the actual error rate  with unerring\n\naccuracy.   Thus, whatever  sampling technique  is used, the  EER\n\n                    \n\n     5Because  the court  of appeals  and the district  court are\nconstrained  to  apply exactly  the  same  standards of  judicial\nreview  in these situations, we cede no deference to the district\ncourt's views.   See Lloyd v. Georgia  Gulf Corp., 961 F.2d 1190,\n                                                 \n1193  (5th Cir. 1992); Terry A. Lambert Plumbing, Inc. v. Western\n                                                                 \nSec. Bank, 934 F.2d 976, 979 (8th Cir. 1991).\n         \n\n                                11\n\nwill sometimes underestimate and sometimes overestimate a state's\n\nactual  error  rate.    Massachusetts  recognizes  this  fact  of\n\nstatistical life but  complains that  it must foot  the bill  for\n\noverestimations  by paying sanctions although if underestimations\n\noccur it reaps no corresponding benefit (e.g., credits that could\n                                             \n\nbe  used to  offset  future penalties).    As  a matter  of  pure\n\nmathematics,  the Commonwealth's  theory appears  to  hold water.\n\nUnder  the federal scheme, the  risk of error  causes the penalty\n\nprovision to weigh more heavily on the states than on the federal\n\ngovernment.6  Nonetheless,  we do not  see how this  circumstance\n\nrenders the scheme unlawful.\n\n          The  Food Stamp Act provides that a state is liable for\n\n\"the dollar value  equivalent of the State agency's payment error\n\nrate, as determined by  the Secretary,\" to the extent  it exceeds\n\nthe  higher of  the  national payment  rate  or the  state  error\n\npayment  rate  minus the  national rate  of  error reduction.   7\n\nU.S.C.A.    2025(g) (West Supp.  1981).   There are  a number  of\n\nmechanisms by which FNS could implement this statutory directive,\n\neach with incumbent advantages and disadvantages.   Massachusetts\n\nsuggests  that   this   court's   right   to   review   liability\n\ndeterminations  de novo leaves us free  to rethink the regulatory\n                       \n\nchoice among these various options.\n\n          We  do not agree.  The power of plenary judicial review\n\n                    \n\n     6Of course, the states  profit from a similar bias  when FNS\nawards  bonuses for  lower error  rates.   In that  instance, the\nfederal government bears the  cost of underestimating state error\nrates but gains no offsetting advantage from overestimates.\n\n                                12\n\ndoes not obviate the devoir of persuasion in a food stamp case in\n\nwhich  a  plaintiff challenges  the  validity  of the  regulatory\n\nmosaic.   See Kulkin, 626 F.2d at 183.   To carry its burden, the\n                    \n\nplaintiff must still  show that the  federal agency exceeded  its\n\nstatutory or constitutional authority.  An attempt to make such a\n\nshowing  must  frankly  recognize  that  the  art  of  regulation\n\ninvolves line-drawing.  When Congress entrusts an agency with the\n\nresponsibility for  drawing lines, and the  agency exercises that\n\nauthority  in a reasonable way,  neither the fact  that there are\n\nother possible places  at which the line  could be drawn  nor the\n\nfact  that the administrative  scheme might  occasionally operate\n\nunfairly   from  a   particular   participant's  perspective   is\n\nsufficient, standing alone,  to undermine the  scheme's legality.\n\nSee  Knebel v. Hein,  429 U.S. 288, 294  (1977) (holding that the\n                   \n\navailability of  more equitable  food stamp regulations  does not\n\nrender  the  Secretary's particular  regulatory  scheme invalid);\n\nLouisiana  v.

In other words, so long as\n\nthe administrative scheme  is a  valid exercise  of the  agency's\n                                      \n\nauthority, whether or  not a perfect exercise of  that authority,\n                                    \n\n                                13\n\nthe courts must honor it.  See Sprandel v. Secretary  of HHS, 838\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  23, 27 (1st Cir.  1988) (per curiam)  (observing that where\n\nadministrative line-drawing is  involved, \"there  are no  perfect\n\nsolutions\").\n\n          These  principles are dispositive  here.  Massachusetts\n\nargues,  in effect, that a system  of credits and debits for each\n\nstate would be  preferable to, and  fairer than, the  statistical\n\nmethodology selected  by FNS.   Whether  or not  this is  so, the\n\nCommonwealth has not demonstrated that the system selected by FNS\n\nis an irrational one,  that it is arbitrarily conceived,  that it\n\nis  profoundly flawed, or that it operates in a wholly capricious\n\nmanner.   Congress  directed  that  the  error  rate  was  to  be\n\n\"determined  by the Secretary,\" 7  U.S.C.A.   2025(g) (West Supp.\n\n1981), and  the Secretary implemented this  directive through the\n\napplication  of what  all  parties agree  is routine  statistical\n\nsampling.  The  enabling statute itself  sets out the  arithmetic\n\nmechanism for determining the sanction, given the error rate; the\n\nSecretary has followed this  command, albeit without refining his\n\nstatistical  estimates.   The  Secretary might,  as Massachusetts\n\nadvocates,  have  installed   a  more  intricate   and  sensitive\n\nstatistical  system,  but doing  so  would  not necessarily  have\n\nrepresented an  improvement.  The proposed  alternatives would by\n\nall  accounts be more  complicated to  administer and  could well\n\nprove less of a deterrent to administrative errors.\n\n          In terms of our analogy, the line drawn  by FNS, as the\n\nSecretary's designee, seems to have been plotted sensibly, if not\n\n                                14\n\nwith  perfect  precision;  that  is, FNS  chose  a  configuration\n\nconsistent  with  statutory  imperatives   and  well  within  the\n\nuniverse  of  plausible approaches.   Because  the administrative\n\nscheme did not exceed  the agency's statutory discretion, summary\n\njudgment was properly granted on this issue.  See Valley Citizens\n                                                                 \n\nfor a Safe  Env't v.

The  district  court,  while noting  that\n\nMassachusetts  had  not raised  the issue  before the  Board, see\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts I, 737 F.

For our part, we see\n                                   \n\nno   reason  to   delve  behind  the   Commonwealth's  procedural\n\ndefault.7     Accordingly,   we  hold   that   Massachusetts,  by\n\n                    \n\n     7Our inquiry  into procedural  default has been  hindered by\nthe  Commonwealth's failure to follow  Fed.

This  failure is  exacerbated by  other\nshortcomings in  the main appendix:   various pages  are missing,\nillegible,  and/or out  of  sequence.    It  is,  of  course,  an\nappellant's obligation  \"to provide  this court with  an appendix\nsufficient  to support its points  on appeal.\"   United States v.\n                                                              \nOne  Motor Yacht  Named Mercury,  527 F.2d  1112, 1113  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n                                15\n\nneglecting to raise this claim before the Board, waived any right\n\nto object to the sample size.8\n\n          In the usual administrative law case, a court ought not\n\nto consider points  which were not  seasonably raised before  the\n\nagency.

When, as now, an appellant shirks this duty, it must bear\nthe  onus  of  any  insufficiencies  in  the  record  on  appeal,\nincluding inadequacies in the appendix.\n\n     8The parties have  characterized the Commonwealth's  failure\nto raise the oversampling  issue as an \"exhaustion\" problem.   We\ndo  not view  it in  that light.   Administrative  exhaustion and\nwaiver can be  concurrent concepts  at times, see  IV Kenneth  C.\n                                                 \nDavis, Administrative  Law Treatise    26:7 (1983), but  they are\n                                   \nnot  synonymous here.  Because the Board's decision was final and\nreviewable by  the district court, we  believe that Massachusetts\nexhausted its  administrative remedies.   See,  e.g., Athehortua-\n                                                                 \nVanegas  v.

As in the trial court/appellate court analogy, requiring\n\nparties to develop their  arguments in the administrative setting\n\nbefore seeking judicial review serves several salutary  purposes.\n\nWe  list three  such purposes  that have  direct bearing  in this\n\ninstance.\n\n          First,  when  the  administrative agency  is  given  an\n\nopportunity to  address a  party's objections,  it can  apply its\n\nexpertise, exercise  its informed  discretion, and create  a more\n\nfinely tuned record for judicial review.  By way of illustration,\n\nif Massachusetts had appropriately raised the oversampling  issue\n\nin  this case, we would now have  the benefit of both the Board's\n\ninterpretation  of the  applicable  regulations  and  its  expert\n\nopinion concerning  the ultimate  effect of the  augmented sample\n\nsize.     Though  different  administrative  conclusions  deserve\n\ndifferent degrees  of deference,  it is essential  to the  proper\n\ndevelopment of  administrative  law that  courts  exercise  their\n\nfunction of judicial review on a well-rounded record.

A  claim  seasonably  presented  to  the  appropriate\n\n                                17\n\nadministrative  body has  an appreciable chance  of being  put to\n\nrest,  or  at least  narrowed,  before  it depletes  the  heavily\n\nburdened  resources of  the federal  courts.   Massachusetts, the\n\namici, and the  court below all  relate previous instances  where\n\nthere  were problems  with  sample sizes  and, consequently,  the\n\nBoard overturned  FNS sanctions.  See, e.g., Massachusetts I, 737\n                                                            \n\nF. Supp. at 122.  Thus, raising the issue before  the Board might\n\nwell have led to its resolution, once and for all.\n\n          Finally,  enforcing  procedural default  solidifies the\n\nagency's autonomy  by allowing it the opportunity  to monitor its\n\nown mistakes and by ensuring that regulated parties do not simply\n\nturn  to the  courts as  a tribunal  of first  resort.   A double\n\nwhammy would  result if  Article III  judges encouraged such  end\n\nruns  by demonstrating a  willingness to  hear all  challenges to\n\nregulatory action regardless of  whether the parties raised those\n\nchallenges before the  affected agency:   power would drain  from\n\nthe agencies  and administrative appeals would  flood the federal\n\ncourts. \n\n          To be  sure, there are  exceptional circumstances under\n\nwhich  a court might dispense with the raise-or-waive rule in the\n\nadministrative  law context.    Cf., e.g.,  United  States v.  La\n                                                                 \n\nGuardia, 902 F.2d  1010, 1012-13 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining why,\n       \n\nin  a  criminal case,  the court  of  appeals would  exercise its\n\ndiscretion to  review a particular constitutional  claim that had\n\nnot been  raised  in the  trial  court).   As a  general  matter,\n\nhowever,  courts will  not entertain  an  issue that  the parties\n\n                                18\n\nfailed  to raise  in the proper  administrative venue  unless the\n\nissue is jurisdictional in nature or some other compelling reason\n\nexists.  See  Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. at  38; Rana v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  812  F.2d  887, 889-90  &amp;  n.2  (4th  Cir. 1987).    The\n      \n\nCommonwealth tenders no such justification here.\n\n          Whether FNS appropriately  followed its own regulations\n\nin regard to  sampling, and  the effect and  consequences of  any\n\nfailure  to  do  so,  are  matters  which  in  no  way  implicate\n\njurisdictional concerns.  On the  contrary, they present the sort\n\nof problems routinely within the Board's purview and at the heart\n\nof its  expertise.   The Commonwealth  has advanced  no palatable\n\nexcuse  for failing to raise the oversampling issue at the proper\n\ntime  and in  the proper  forum.   Under these  circumstances, we\n\ncannot  justify  any  relaxation  of  the  customary rule.    The\n\nCommonwealth waived the oversampling issue.9\n\nIV.  GOOD-CAUSE WAIVERS\n\n          Massachusetts argues  that it  was entitled to  a good-\n\ncause  waiver as  a matter of  right and that  the district court\n\nerred in summarily rejecting its beseechment.  We do not agree.\n\n          Unlike  questions of  statistical propriety,  see supra\n                                                                 \n\nPart III, the  matter of  a good-cause waiver  is not  imbricated\n\n                    \n\n     9Incident to  this procedural default  is the Commonwealth's\nquest for  reversal on the ground  of inconsistent administrative\npositions.   But  here, the  Commonwealth is  hoist with  its own\npetard.    It did  not bring  the  oversampling issue  before the\nBoard,  thus depriving  the Board  of the  chance to  explore the\nissue in a  zoetic context informed  by both case-specific  facts\nand  administrative  precedents.   Because  we  cannot judge  the\nBoard's  consistency on an issue  it did not  adjudicate, we deem\nthis related claim to be waived as well.\n\n                                19\n\nwith a fundamental determination  of liability but relates solely\n\nto FNS's  determination of the  appropriate sanction.   Thus, the\n\nFood Stamp  Act's  provision  for  de novo  review  of  liability\n                                          \n\nfindings  does  not apply.10    Instead,  we  review  the  waiver\n\ndenial to see whether it  was arbitrary, capricious, or  contrary\n\nto law.

In\n                                           \n\nso doing, we recognize that an administrative agency enjoys great\n\nlatitude  to   interpret  its   own  rules  as   long  as   those\n\ninterpretations  are  reasonable.

See 7\n                                                               \n\nC.F.R.   275.25(d)(5)(A)-(G).   Whereas a threshold showing along\n\nthese  lines may  qualify a  state for  a good-cause  waiver, the\n\nSecretary  can  still deny  the waiver  if  he finds  the state's\n\nshowing insufficient  either because other factors overshadow the\n\napplicant's  compendium  of  exculpatory  factors  or  because  a\n\nparticular  event  or  events  listed  by  the  applicant  cannot\n\nwithstand objective scrutiny.12  Id.\n                                    \n\n          Massachusetts  sought  a  good-cause  waiver  on  three\n\ngrounds, viz., caseload growth, changes in federal laws, and good\n\n                    \n\n     11The  Secretary has  delegated this  power to  FNS.   See 7\n                                                               \nC.F.R.   275.25(d)(5) (1982).\n\n     12The regulations also provide  for an \"automatic\" waiver in\ncertain limited  circumstances.   See 7 C.F.R.    275.25(d)(5)(G)\n                                     \n(1982).  In  order to receive  such a waiver,  a state must  have\nimplemented an FNS-approved corrective  action program in the six\nmonths before  the period during  which the excessive  error rate\nmaterialized, and must meet  specially reduced target error rates\nthereafter.  The record does not indicate that Massachusetts ever\nclaimed  eligibility for  an  automatic waiver  applicable to  FY\n1982.\n\n                                21\n\nfaith efforts to  reduce its error rate.   FNS denied the waiver.\n\nIn so doing, it took much of the wind from Massachusetts's sails.\n\nSpecifically, FNS explained  that Massachusetts's caseload growth\n\nwas  not  a sufficient  excusatory  fact because  the  figure was\n\nbloated  by   one-time  social  security   \"cash-ins\";  that  new\n\nlegislation was not a factor because the state had four months to\n\nadapt  to changes in the law; and that Massachusetts's efforts to\n\nreduce errors  were anything but \"exemplary.\"   Additionally, FNS\n\nbrought an  independent set of considerations  to bear, stressing\n\nthe  Commonwealth's steady  history  of failing  to meet  program\n\ndeadlines  and requirements.    The Board  approved the  agency's\n\ndecision to withhold  a waiver  on this ground  and the  district\n\ncourt affirmed by summary judgment.\n\n          Massachusetts  and FNS  attempt to  rejoin  this point-\n\ncounterpoint  before us.  Our  role in this  setting, however, is\n\nnot  to weigh the factual  averments and assess,  on balance, the\n\nmerits of a waiver.  Rather, \"[i]f the court upholds the agency's\n\nfinding  of violation,  the  court's only  remaining  task is  to\n\nexamine  the  sanction imposed  in  light  of the  administrative\n\nrecord  to   judge  whether  the  agency   properly  applied  its\n\nregulations  . . . .\"   Broad St.,  720 F.2d at 220.   In fine, a\n                                 \n\nreviewing court may only  overturn agency sanction determinations\n\nthat  are arbitrary  and capricious,  see id.,  which is  to say,\n                                             \n\n\"unwarranted  in law  . .  . or  without justification  in fact.\"\n\nButz  v.

Because we  are  scrutinizing  the district  court's\n\ndisposition of  a motion filed  under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  56(c), we\n\nmust approach the  record \"in  the light most  hospitable to  the\n\nparty  opposing  summary   judgment,  indulging  all   reasonable\n\ninferences in  that party's  favor.\"  Griggs-Ryan  v. Smith,  904\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 112,  115 (1st Cir. 1990).   In order to prevail, therefore,\n\nthe  Commonwealth  must persuade  us  that the  record  evinces a\n\ngenuine dispute over  some material fact.   Emphasizing the items\n\nset  forth in  support of  its waiver  application, Massachusetts\n\nsays  that  such  a  dispute  existed.    But,  this  perspective\n\noverlooks the relevant point:   the real question is  not whether\n\nthe  facts set  forth in  support of  the waiver  application are\n\ndisputed,  but, rather,  whether the  administrative record,  now\n\nclosed,  reflects  a sufficient  dispute  concerning  the factual\n\npredicate on  which FNS relied in denying the waiver to support a\n\nfinding that the  agency acted arbitrarily  or capriciously.   We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n          On a motion for summary judgment, a fact is material if\n\nit  \"might affect  the outcome  of the  suit under  the governing\n\nlaw\"; a dispute is  \"genuine\" if a reasonable jury  could resolve\n\nit in favor of the nonmoving  party.

In a nutshell, then, a bona fide\n      \n\nskirmish  over the  veracity  and importance  of ancillary  facts\n\nwhich the Commonwealth thinks support its waiver application does\n\nnot  egest the  possibility of  summary judgment,  for it  is the\n\nbasis underlying the  agency's denial  of a waiver  upon which  a\n\nreviewing court must focus.  See Town of Norfolk v.

Supp. at 1275.  We  agree with this assessment.   We add,\n\nmoreover,  that, as  this court  has recognized  for  many years,\n\nsimply rearguing the merits of an agency's discretionary decision\n\nwill not forestall summary judgment on such an issue.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nConcerned  Citizens on I-190 v.

Although  we, like the district court, assume\n\nfor  argument's  sake that  the  subsidiary  facts on  which  the\n\nCommonwealth's  waiver  application rested  are true,  the record\n\nnevertheless reveals  that FNS  weighed these facts  against, and\n\neventually based  its denial  on, other uncontested  facts (e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nthe  contribution  of  Social  Security  \"cash-ins\"  to  caseload\n\ngrowth, the superior performance of  other states under much  the\n\nsame  circumstances,  and  Massachusetts's checkered  history  of\n\nnoncompliance  with food  stamp program  directives).   Regarding\n\nthis latter  set of subsidiary  facts, there is no  dispute.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts II, 788 F. Supp. at 1274.\n                \n\n          Let  us be  perfectly clear.   We  do not  suggest that\n\ncourts should  rubber-stamp agency  decisions under the  guise of\n\n\"arbitrary-and-capricious\"  review.    Had  FNS,  in  this  case,\n\nrejected the waiver  application on a ground that its regulations\n\ndid  not  contemplate,  or without  considering  the  applicant's\n\nstated  basis   for  relief,  or  in  reliance  on  a  manifestly\n\ninadequate  factual showing, there might well be room for a court\n\nto  find the  agency's actions  arbitrary  and capricious.   But,\n\n                                25\n\nnothing  of the kind transpired here.  Rather, the record reveals\n\na  situation in  which  FNS carefully  considered  the whole  and\n\ndeclined   rationally, if not inevitably   to grant discretionary\n\nrelief.\n\n          In the final analysis, Congress elected to delegate the\n\ndiscretion to  award or withhold good-cause waivers of food stamp\n\npenalties to the Secretary    not to the federal courts.   Where,\n\nas here,  the legislature has conferred  generous discretion upon\n\nan agency, a reviewing  court must contemplate the administrative\n\nrecord  with  due  regard  for  that  discretion  and  gauge  the\n\nreasonableness of agency  action in  that light.   Given the  low\n\nquantum   of   factual   justification   necessary   to   deny  a\n\ndiscretionary waiver under section 2025(g), we are constrained to\n\nconclude that, since FNS's denial of the waiver  was based upon a\n\nplausible and  essentially uncontested set of  reasons documented\n\nin  the  record and  consistent  with  existing regulations,  the\n\ndistrict court correctly ruled in its favor, notwithstanding that\n\nthe case was at the summary judgment stage.

Consequently, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the\n\nbranch of the United States Department of Agriculture responsible\n\nfor  overseeing  the  food  stamp  program,  imposed  a  punitive\n\nsanction.\n\n          Massachusetts unsuccessfully appealed  the sanction  to\n\nthe Food Stamp Appeal Board (the Board).  It then sought judicial\n\nreview in federal  district court.  See  7 U.S.C.   2023  (1982).\n                                       \n\nThe  court granted summary judgment in  favor of the defendants,1\n\nalbeit in two steps.   See Massachusetts v. United States, 737 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  120 (D.

Mass. 1992)  (Massachusetts\n                                                                 \n\nII).\n  \n\n          Finding the penalty  hard to swallow, the  Commonwealth\n\nserves  up a  gallimaufry  of issues  for appellate  mastication.\n\nAlthough these issues  contain some food  for thought, they  lack\n\ntrue  nutritive  value.   Consequently,  we  affirm the  judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.  FACTUAL PRELUDE\n\n          Congress designed the Food Stamp  Act of 1964, Pub.  L.\n\n                    \n\n     1The Commonwealth named a host  of federal defendants in its\nsuit, including the United  States, the Secretary of Agriculture,\nthe Department  of Agriculture, the Board, and  FNS.  For ease in\nreference,  we treat the appeal as if the appellees were a single\nentity.\n\n                                2\n\nNo. 88-525, 78 Stat. 103 (1964), codified as amended, 7 U.S.C.   \n                                                    \n\n2011-2030 (1982),  to provide low-income families  with access to\n\ngovernment-subsidized  foodstuffs.    Although the  coupons  were\n\nactually disbursed  by the  participating states, FNS  paid fifty\n\npercent  of the administrative  costs and one  hundred percent of\n\nthe  food  subsidy  costs.   In  time,  the  federal government's\n\ngenerosity   produced   an  unfortunate   side   effect;  because\n\noverpayments were charged  to the federal tab, states  had little\n\nincentive  to  keep   distributions  in  line.     To  curb  this\n\nprofligacy, Congress eventually enacted a quality control program\n\n(QCP) to ensure more accurate food stamp distribution.  The first\n\nQCP took effect  in 1977.  Pub. L. No. 95-113,   16, 91 Stat. 976\n\n(1977).\n\n          From that point forward, Congress persistently tinkered\n\nwith the QCP's features.   During FY 1982, the  QCP required that\n\neach state  survey a sample of  its food stamp cases  in order to\n\nestimate  in what percentage of them it had distributed the wrong\n\nnumber  of food stamps.  After receiving the states' tallies, FNS\n\nwould set a target error rate (the TER), take a subsample of each\n\nstate's  cases, recheck  them for  errors, and  employ regression\n\nanalysis  to blend the federal and state estimates of state error\n\nrates into a single estimated error rate (the EER) for the state.\n\nSee 7 U.S.C.A.   2025(g) (West Supp. 1981); 94 Stat. 363  (1980);\n   \n\nsee also  7 C.F.R.    275.25(d)(6)  (1982).   If the state's  EER\n        \n\nsurpassed the TER, as  determined by FNS, the  federal government\n\n                                3\n\nimposed a  monetary sanction.2    Such fines  were calculated  by\n\nmultiplying the  total dollar  value of state-issued  food stamps\n\nfor  the fiscal year times the difference between the state's EER\n\nand  its TER.  See 7 C.F.R.    275.25(d)(3) (1982).  If, however,\n                  \n\nthe  state's EER  was below  five percent,  the state  received a\n\nbonus:   the federal government increased its contribution to the\n\nprogram's  administrative  costs  from  fifty  percent  to  sixty\n\npercent.  See 7 C.F.R.   275.25(c)(2)(i) (1982).\n             \n\n          In  FY  1982,  FNS  set Massachusetts's  TER  at  14.88\n\npercent.   After the two sovereigns completed  their sampling and\n\nresolved some mathematical bevues by negotiation, FNS figured the\n\nEER  to be  roughly  16.35 percent  and,  accordingly, fined  the\n\nCommonwealth $1,323,864.   The penalty survived  scrutiny by both\n\nthe Board and the district court.\n\n          In  this  appeal,  Massachusetts makes  four  principal\n\nclaims:  (1)  that the  quality control provisions  on which  the\n\nsanction rested were  no longer  in effect when  FNS imposed  the\n\nsanction; (2) that FNS's sampling methodology was so biased as to\n\noffend  the Food  Stamp Act; (3)  that FNS's  use of  too large a\n\nsample skewed the results; and (4) that FNS erred in  refusing to\n\ngrant  a good-cause  waiver.   We  treat  these asseverations  in\n\nsequence.\n\nII.  LACK OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY\n\n          Massachusetts and the amici join in urging that FNS had\n\n                    \n\n     2We discuss  infra Part  IV the circumstances  in which  the\n                       \nimposition of a monetary sanction might be waived.\n\n                                4\n\nno  authority  to levy  sanctions  for FY  1982  because Congress\n\nrepealed the QCP  effective October  1, 1982.   This claim  stems\n\nfrom  passage of  the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation  Act (OBRA),\n\nPub.  L. No. 97-253, 96 Stat. 763 (1982), enacted in September of\n\n1982.   OBRA completely revamped the Food Stamp Act's approach to\n\nquality   control.    The  legislation  repealed  the  previously\n\nexisting QCP and  fashioned a  new regimen  effective October  1,\n\n1982 (the first  day of  FY 1983).   Massachusetts contends  that\n\nthis   legislative   legerdemain   undermined   FNS's   authority\n\nthereafter to impose sanctions for FY 1982.3\n\n          It is a hoary rule of the common law that the repeal of\n\na statute  eliminates any inchoate liability  for penalties under\n\nthe repealed statute.  See, e.g., United States v. Reisinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92342\"><a href=\"/opinion/92342/united-states-v-reisinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (1888).  In order to ameliorate this rule, Congress\n\npassed a general savings statute providing in pertinent part that\n\nthe \"repeal of  any statute shall not have the  effect to release\n\nor  extinguish  any penalty,  forfeiture,  or  liability incurred\n\nunder such statute . . . .\"  1 U.S.C.   109 (1982).  On its face,\n\nsection 109 seems adequate to preserve the authority by which FNS\n\npurposed to sanction the Commonwealth.\n\n          In  an  effort to  escape  the  savings statute's  web,\n\nMassachusetts  notes that  the QCP  allowed waivers  of liability\n\n                    \n\n     3Since  we  can  find  no  indication  in  the  record  that\nMassachusetts raised this issue before the Board, the point is at\nleast  arguably waived.    But, because  the  issue goes  to  the\nBoard's jurisdiction and because  the appellees have not advanced\na claim of waiver,  we choose to address it,  notwithstanding the\npossible incidence of procedural default.\n\n                                5\n\npremised on subsequent corrective measures.  See, e.g., 7  C.F.R.\n                                                      \n\n  275.25(d)(5)  (1982).   From this datum,  Massachusetts deduces\n\nthat it could not  have \"incurred\" liability until such  a waiver\n\nwas  denied    an event  which took place  well after  October 1,\n\n1982.  The  court below  found this argument  unpersuasive.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts II, 788 F. Supp.  at 1269 n.3. So do we.   The mere\n                \n\nfact that Congress grants  an agent the power to  waive sanctions\n\ndoes not  turn back the  clock and  eradicate the reality  of the\n\nunderlying violation.  Thus, we  do not believe Congress intended\n\nthat liability would  be deemed \"incurred\"  under federal law,  1\n\nU.S.C.      109,   only  when   all  opportunities   for  special\n\ndispensations had been exhausted and a previously imposed penalty\n\nhad  become irreversible.  See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. v. Federal\n                                                                 \n\nEnergy  Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1294 n.3  (Temp. Emer.  Ct. App.\n              \n\n1979)  (explaining why  costs  should be  deemed \"incurred\"  even\n\nbefore the amount has become certain).  Rather, we think Congress\n\nintended  that states incur liability for their food stamp errors\n\nat the conclusion of the  six-month monitoring period, 7 U.S.C.A.\n\n  2025(g)(1)  (West Supp. 1981)    a period which, in  this case,\n\nended September 30, 1982.\n\n          We have two main reasons for interpreting the interface\n\nbetween the Food Stamp  Act and the savings statute in  this way.\n\nIn  the first place, it appears well established that the savings\n\nstatute  was designed to prevent  exactly the sort  of lapse that\n\nMassachusetts argues occurred here.   See, e.g., Hamm v.  City of\n                                                                 \n\nRock  Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106952\"><a href=\"/opinion/106952/hamm-v-rock-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (1964) (\"The federal saving statute\n          \n\n                                6\n\n. . . was meant to obviate mere technical abatement such as . . .\n\na  substitution of  a  new statute  with  a greater  schedule  of\n\npenalties . .  . .\"); United States v. Holley,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488056\"><a href=\"/opinion/488056/united-states-v-harrol-jerry-holley/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353\n                                             \n\n(5th Cir.  1987)  (similar).   Reading  the  savings  statute  to\n\nrelease from liability any party who had not yet exhausted after-\n\nthe-fact remediation would hamper  the law's goal, contravene the\n\nSupreme Court's  longstanding interpretation  of how the  statute\n\nshould  be applied,  and encourage  violators to  petition willy-\n\nnilly for  discretionary administrative  relief in the  hope that\n\nthe statutory scheme might be changed betweentimes.\n\n          In the second place, the statutory structure predicates\n\nwaiver on precedent liability.  See 7 U.S.C.A.   2025(g)(1) (West\n                                   \n\nSupp. 1981) (providing that, under the Food Stamp Act's liability\n\nprogram, an offending state shall pay the imposed fine unless the\n\nSecretary determines that good  cause exists for waiver).   We do\n\nnot  think  Congress  placed the  cart  to  the  horse's rear  by\n\naccident.  Had  Congress wished waiver considerations to  be part\n\nand parcel  of a  liability determination,  it would  simply have\n\nwritten the Food Stamp Act to premise liability on the absence of\n\nthose  factors that  allow  the granting  of good-cause  waivers.\n\nCongress chose to structure the statute differently, however, and\n\nwe must honor its  bipartite design in our interpretation.

STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY\n\n          Having   confirmed  the   vitality   of  the   sanction\n\nprovision,  we turn  next  to  the Commonwealth's  double-jointed\n\nchallenge  to  the  statistical methodology  that  FNS  employed.\n\nBefore  reaching Massachusetts's  two  substantive arguments,  we\n\nthink  it  is  useful to  explicate  the  applicable standard  of\n\njudicial review.\n\n                                8\n\n                     A.

The\n                                       \n\nquestion  in the  instant case  is more  complex because  the two\n\nparts of the calculus   liability and sanctions   are imbricated:\n\nFNS's determination  that  Massachusetts's EER  was  unacceptably\n\nhigh essentially determined both the Commonwealth's liability and\n                                \n\nthe  amount  of  the   resultant  sanction.    See  7   C.F.R.   \n                                                  \n\n275.25(d)(3) (1982) (explicated supra pp. 3-4).\n                                     \n\n          Notwithstanding  this  conflation   of  liability   and\n\nremediation,  a  reviewing court's  path  remains  clear.   Where\n\nliability  is  at issue,  section  2023(a)  requires that  courts\n\nreview administrative determinations de  novo.  If this statutory\n                                             \n\nbedrock is to  endure, inexorably mixed  issues of liability  and\n\nsanctions  must  likewise be  assessed de  novo,  even if  such a\n                                               \n\npenetrating standard  of judicial review intrudes  to some extent\n\ninto agency decisionmaking in the sanctions area.  Thus,  insofar\n\nas the Commonwealth's assignments of error implicate the validity\n\nof  the EER  and, therefore,  the amount  of the  penalty levied,\n\nplenary review is indicated.\n\n          We are quick to remark, however, that de novo review in\n                                                       \n\ncases  of this genre does not give  courts an entirely free hand.\n\nWhere, as here, the issues before the court  are legal in nature,\n\nde novo review of an administrative matter does not mean that the\n       \n\n                                10\n\ndistrict  court must  devise an  entirely new  regulatory scheme.\n\nRather, in  respect to  liability issues,  the court  must ensure\n\nthat the agency has  followed its own regulations and  that those\n\nregulations  do not  exceed the  scope of  the  agency's mandate.\n\nWith  these precepts in  mind, we now  address the Commonwealth's\n\nstatistical arguments.5\n\n                      B.  Statistical Bias.\n                                          \n\n          In order  to estimate Massachusetts's food  stamp error\n\nrate  and thereby  determine  what  (if  any) sanction  might  be\n\nappropriate,  FNS sampled  194  of the  Commonwealth's cases  for\n\ncompliance.  Massachusetts and the amici urge that the appellees'\n\nsampling  methodology  is  unlawful  because the  risk  of  error\n\ninherent in FNS's approximation is not evenly  shared between the\n\nstate  and the  federal  government.   Because FNS's  statistical\n\nmethod  effectively  determines the  Commonwealth's  liability as\n\nwell as the amount of  the sanction to be imposed, our  review of\n\nthe statistical bias claim is plenary.\n\n          We  start with  the  obvious:    FNS's sampling  is  no\n\ndifferent than any  other statistical sampling in  that it cannot\n\nproduce results that reflect the actual error rate  with unerring\n\naccuracy.   Thus, whatever  sampling technique  is used, the  EER\n\n                    \n\n     5Because  the court  of appeals  and the district  court are\nconstrained  to  apply exactly  the  same  standards of  judicial\nreview  in these situations, we cede no deference to the district\ncourt's views.

Massachusetts  recognizes  this  fact  of\n\nstatistical life but  complains that  it must foot  the bill  for\n\noverestimations  by paying sanctions although if underestimations\n\noccur it reaps no corresponding benefit (e.g., credits that could\n                                             \n\nbe  used to  offset  future penalties).    As  a matter  of  pure\n\nmathematics,  the Commonwealth's  theory appears  to  hold water.\n\nUnder  the federal scheme, the  risk of error  causes the penalty\n\nprovision to weigh more heavily on the states than on the federal\n\ngovernment.6  Nonetheless,  we do not  see how this  circumstance\n\nrenders the scheme unlawful.\n\n          The  Food Stamp Act provides that a state is liable for\n\n\"the dollar value  equivalent of the State agency's payment error\n\nrate, as determined by  the Secretary,\" to the extent  it exceeds\n\nthe  higher of  the  national payment  rate  or the  state  error\n\npayment  rate  minus the  national rate  of  error reduction.   7\n\nU.S.C.A.    2025(g) (West Supp.  1981).   There are  a number  of\n\nmechanisms by which FNS could implement this statutory directive,\n\neach with incumbent advantages and disadvantages.   Massachusetts\n\nsuggests  that   this   court's   right   to   review   liability\n\ndeterminations  de novo leaves us free  to rethink the regulatory\n                       \n\nchoice among these various options.\n\n          We  do not agree.  The power of plenary judicial review\n\n                    \n\n     6Of course, the states  profit from a similar bias  when FNS\nawards  bonuses for  lower error  rates.   In that  instance, the\nfederal government bears the  cost of underestimating state error\nrates but gains no offsetting advantage from overestimates.\n\n                                12\n\ndoes not obviate the devoir of persuasion in a food stamp case in\n\nwhich  a  plaintiff challenges  the  validity  of the  regulatory\n\nmosaic.   See Kulkin, 626 F.2d at 183.   To carry its burden, the\n                    \n\nplaintiff must still  show that the  federal agency exceeded  its\n\nstatutory or constitutional authority.  An attempt to make such a\n\nshowing  must  frankly  recognize  that  the  art  of  regulation\n\ninvolves line-drawing.  When Congress entrusts an agency with the\n\nresponsibility for  drawing lines, and the  agency exercises that\n\nauthority  in a reasonable way,  neither the fact  that there are\n\nother possible places  at which the line  could be drawn  nor the\n\nfact  that the administrative  scheme might  occasionally operate\n\nunfairly   from  a   particular   participant's  perspective   is\n\nsufficient, standing alone,  to undermine the  scheme's legality.\n\nSee  Knebel v.

Massachusetts\n\nargues,  in effect, that a system  of credits and debits for each\n\nstate would be  preferable to, and  fairer than, the  statistical\n\nmethodology selected  by FNS.   Whether  or not  this is  so, the\n\nCommonwealth has not demonstrated that the system selected by FNS\n\nis an irrational one,  that it is arbitrarily conceived,  that it\n\nis  profoundly flawed, or that it operates in a wholly capricious\n\nmanner.   Congress  directed  that  the  error  rate  was  to  be\n\n\"determined  by the Secretary,\" 7  U.S.C.A.   2025(g) (West Supp.\n\n1981), and  the Secretary implemented this  directive through the\n\napplication  of what  all  parties agree  is routine  statistical\n\nsampling.  The  enabling statute itself  sets out the  arithmetic\n\nmechanism for determining the sanction, given the error rate; the\n\nSecretary has followed this  command, albeit without refining his\n\nstatistical  estimates.   The  Secretary might,  as Massachusetts\n\nadvocates,  have  installed   a  more  intricate   and  sensitive\n\nstatistical  system,  but doing  so  would  not necessarily  have\n\nrepresented an  improvement.  The proposed  alternatives would by\n\nall  accounts be more  complicated to  administer and  could well\n\nprove less of a deterrent to administrative errors.\n\n          In terms of our analogy, the line drawn  by FNS, as the\n\nSecretary's designee, seems to have been plotted sensibly, if not\n\n                                14\n\nwith  perfect  precision;  that  is, FNS  chose  a  configuration\n\nconsistent  with  statutory  imperatives   and  well  within  the\n\nuniverse  of  plausible approaches.

As in the trial court/appellate court analogy, requiring\n\nparties to develop their  arguments in the administrative setting\n\nbefore seeking judicial review serves several salutary  purposes.\n\nWe  list three  such purposes  that have  direct bearing  in this\n\ninstance.\n\n          First,  when  the  administrative agency  is  given  an\n\nopportunity to  address a  party's objections,  it can  apply its\n\nexpertise, exercise  its informed  discretion, and create  a more\n\nfinely tuned record for judicial review.  By way of illustration,\n\nif Massachusetts had appropriately raised the oversampling  issue\n\nin  this case, we would now have  the benefit of both the Board's\n\ninterpretation  of the  applicable  regulations  and  its  expert\n\nopinion concerning  the ultimate  effect of the  augmented sample\n\nsize.     Though  different  administrative  conclusions  deserve\n\ndifferent degrees  of deference,  it is essential  to the  proper\n\ndevelopment of  administrative  law that  courts  exercise  their\n\nfunction of judicial review on a well-rounded record.  See McKart\n                                                                 \n\nv.

A  claim  seasonably  presented  to  the  appropriate\n\n                                17\n\nadministrative  body has  an appreciable chance  of being  put to\n\nrest,  or  at least  narrowed,  before  it depletes  the  heavily\n\nburdened  resources of  the federal  courts.   Massachusetts, the\n\namici, and the  court below all  relate previous instances  where\n\nthere  were problems  with  sample sizes  and, consequently,  the\n\nBoard overturned  FNS sanctions.  See, e.g., Massachusetts I, 737\n                                                            \n\nF. Supp. at 122.  Thus, raising the issue before  the Board might\n\nwell have led to its resolution, once and for all.\n\n          Finally,  enforcing  procedural default  solidifies the\n\nagency's autonomy  by allowing it the opportunity  to monitor its\n\nown mistakes and by ensuring that regulated parties do not simply\n\nturn  to the  courts as  a tribunal  of first  resort.   A double\n\nwhammy would  result if  Article III  judges encouraged such  end\n\nruns  by demonstrating a  willingness to  hear all  challenges to\n\nregulatory action regardless of  whether the parties raised those\n\nchallenges before the  affected agency:   power would drain  from\n\nthe agencies  and administrative appeals would  flood the federal\n\ncourts. \n\n          To be  sure, there are  exceptional circumstances under\n\nwhich  a court might dispense with the raise-or-waive rule in the\n\nadministrative  law context.

The\n      \n\nCommonwealth tenders no such justification here.\n\n          Whether FNS appropriately  followed its own regulations\n\nin regard to  sampling, and  the effect and  consequences of  any\n\nfailure  to  do  so,  are  matters  which  in  no  way  implicate\n\njurisdictional concerns.  On the  contrary, they present the sort\n\nof problems routinely within the Board's purview and at the heart\n\nof its  expertise.   The Commonwealth  has advanced  no palatable\n\nexcuse  for failing to raise the oversampling issue at the proper\n\ntime  and in  the proper  forum.   Under these  circumstances, we\n\ncannot  justify  any  relaxation  of  the  customary rule.    The\n\nCommonwealth waived the oversampling issue.9\n\nIV.  GOOD-CAUSE WAIVERS\n\n          Massachusetts argues  that it  was entitled to  a good-\n\ncause  waiver as  a matter of  right and that  the district court\n\nerred in summarily rejecting its beseechment.  We do not agree.\n\n          Unlike  questions of  statistical propriety,  see supra\n                                                                 \n\nPart III, the  matter of  a good-cause waiver  is not  imbricated\n\n                    \n\n     9Incident to  this procedural default  is the Commonwealth's\nquest for  reversal on the ground  of inconsistent administrative\npositions.   But  here, the  Commonwealth is  hoist with  its own\npetard.    It did  not bring  the  oversampling issue  before the\nBoard,  thus depriving  the Board  of the  chance to  explore the\nissue in a  zoetic context informed  by both case-specific  facts\nand  administrative  precedents.   Because  we  cannot judge  the\nBoard's  consistency on an issue  it did not  adjudicate, we deem\nthis related claim to be waived as well.\n\n                                19\n\nwith a fundamental determination  of liability but relates solely\n\nto FNS's  determination of the  appropriate sanction.   Thus, the\n\nFood Stamp  Act's  provision  for  de novo  review  of  liability\n                                          \n\nfindings  does  not apply.10    Instead,  we  review  the  waiver\n\ndenial to see whether it  was arbitrary, capricious, or  contrary\n\nto law.

In\n                                           \n\nso doing, we recognize that an administrative agency enjoys great\n\nlatitude  to   interpret  its   own  rules  as   long  as   those\n\ninterpretations  are  reasonable.

Whereas a threshold showing along\n\nthese  lines may  qualify a  state for  a good-cause  waiver, the\n\nSecretary  can  still deny  the waiver  if  he finds  the state's\n\nshowing insufficient  either because other factors overshadow the\n\napplicant's  compendium  of  exculpatory  factors  or  because  a\n\nparticular  event  or  events  listed  by  the  applicant  cannot\n\nwithstand objective scrutiny.12  Id.\n                                    \n\n          Massachusetts  sought  a  good-cause  waiver  on  three\n\ngrounds, viz., caseload growth, changes in federal laws, and good\n\n                    \n\n     11The  Secretary has  delegated this  power to  FNS.   See 7\n                                                               \nC.F.R.   275.25(d)(5) (1982).\n\n     12The regulations also provide  for an \"automatic\" waiver in\ncertain limited  circumstances.

In  order to receive  such a waiver,  a state must  have\nimplemented an FNS-approved corrective  action program in the six\nmonths before  the period during  which the excessive  error rate\nmaterialized, and must meet  specially reduced target error rates\nthereafter.  The record does not indicate that Massachusetts ever\nclaimed  eligibility for  an  automatic waiver  applicable to  FY\n1982.\n\n                                21\n\nfaith efforts to  reduce its error rate.   FNS denied the waiver.\n\nIn so doing, it took much of the wind from Massachusetts's sails.\n\nSpecifically, FNS explained  that Massachusetts's caseload growth\n\nwas  not  a sufficient  excusatory  fact because  the  figure was\n\nbloated  by   one-time  social  security   \"cash-ins\";  that  new\n\nlegislation was not a factor because the state had four months to\n\nadapt  to changes in the law; and that Massachusetts's efforts to\n\nreduce errors  were anything but \"exemplary.\"   Additionally, FNS\n\nbrought an  independent set of considerations  to bear, stressing\n\nthe  Commonwealth's steady  history  of failing  to meet  program\n\ndeadlines  and requirements.    The Board  approved the  agency's\n\ndecision to withhold  a waiver  on this ground  and the  district\n\ncourt affirmed by summary judgment.\n\n          Massachusetts  and FNS  attempt to  rejoin  this point-\n\ncounterpoint  before us.  Our  role in this  setting, however, is\n\nnot  to weigh the factual  averments and assess,  on balance, the\n\nmerits of a waiver.  Rather, \"[i]f the court upholds the agency's\n\nfinding  of violation,  the  court's only  remaining  task is  to\n\nexamine  the  sanction imposed  in  light  of the  administrative\n\nrecord  to   judge  whether  the  agency   properly  applied  its\n\nregulations  . . . .\"   Broad St.,  720 F.2d at 220.

In order to prevail, therefore,\n\nthe  Commonwealth  must persuade  us  that the  record  evinces a\n\ngenuine dispute over  some material fact.   Emphasizing the items\n\nset  forth in  support of  its waiver  application, Massachusetts\n\nsays  that  such  a  dispute  existed.    But,  this  perspective\n\noverlooks the relevant point:   the real question is  not whether\n\nthe  facts set  forth in  support of  the waiver  application are\n\ndisputed,  but, rather,  whether the  administrative record,  now\n\nclosed,  reflects  a sufficient  dispute  concerning  the factual\n\npredicate on  which FNS relied in denying the waiver to support a\n\nfinding that the  agency acted arbitrarily  or capriciously.   We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n          On a motion for summary judgment, a fact is material if\n\nit  \"might affect  the outcome  of the  suit under  the governing\n\nlaw\"; a dispute is  \"genuine\" if a reasonable jury  could resolve\n\nit in favor of the nonmoving  party.

We add,\n\nmoreover,  that, as  this court  has recognized  for  many years,\n\nsimply rearguing the merits of an agency's discretionary decision\n\nwill not forestall summary judgment on such an issue.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nConcerned  Citizens on I-190 v.

Although  we, like the district court, assume\n\nfor  argument's  sake that  the  subsidiary  facts on  which  the\n\nCommonwealth's  waiver  application rested  are true,  the record\n\nnevertheless reveals  that FNS  weighed these facts  against, and\n\neventually based  its denial  on, other uncontested  facts (e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nthe  contribution  of  Social  Security  \"cash-ins\"  to  caseload\n\ngrowth, the superior performance of  other states under much  the\n\nsame  circumstances,  and  Massachusetts's checkered  history  of\n\nnoncompliance  with food  stamp program  directives).   Regarding\n\nthis latter  set of subsidiary  facts, there is no  dispute.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts II, 788 F. Supp. at 1274.\n                \n\n          Let  us be  perfectly clear.   We  do not  suggest that\n\ncourts should  rubber-stamp agency  decisions under the  guise of\n\n\"arbitrary-and-capricious\"  review.    Had  FNS,  in  this  case,\n\nrejected the waiver  application on a ground that its regulations\n\ndid  not  contemplate,  or without  considering  the  applicant's\n\nstated  basis   for  relief,  or  in  reliance  on  a  manifestly\n\ninadequate  factual showing, there might well be room for a court\n\nto  find the  agency's actions  arbitrary  and capricious.   But,\n\n                                25\n\nnothing  of the kind transpired here.  Rather, the record reveals\n\na  situation in  which  FNS carefully  considered  the whole  and\n\ndeclined   rationally, if not inevitably   to grant discretionary\n\nrelief.\n\n          In the final analysis, Congress elected to delegate the\n\ndiscretion to  award or withhold good-cause waivers of food stamp\n\npenalties to the Secretary    not to the federal courts.   Where,\n\nas here,  the legislature has conferred  generous discretion upon\n\nan agency, a reviewing  court must contemplate the administrative\n\nrecord  with  due  regard  for  that  discretion  and  gauge  the\n\nreasonableness of agency  action in  that light.   Given the  low\n\nquantum   of   factual   justification   necessary   to   deny  a\n\ndiscretionary waiver under section 2025(g), we are constrained to\n\nconclude that, since FNS's denial of the waiver  was based upon a\n\nplausible and  essentially uncontested set of  reasons documented\n\nin  the  record and  consistent  with  existing regulations,  the\n\ndistrict court correctly ruled in its favor, notwithstanding that\n\nthe case was at the summary judgment stage.

The   Commonwealth's\n\nasseverational  array  announces an  abundance  of  red meat  and\n\nstrong drink; yet, its table is spread with far less hearty fare.\n\nBecause  appellant's arguments  afford  scant sustenance  for its\n\n                                26\n\nposition, the disputed sanction must stand.
