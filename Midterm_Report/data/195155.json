On October  30, 1992,  the\n                              \n\nCoast Guard  intercepted a  wooden yawl  taking 110  illegal\n\naliens  to Puerto  Rico.    A  Border Patrol  officer  later\n\nrecognized  one of  those  aliens,  defendant Junior  Mendez\n\nColon, as a convicted alien smuggler whom the  United States\n\nhad previously deported.  Mendez subsequently pled guilty to\n\nthe  crime of unlawfully re-entering the United States after\n\nbeing  deported for  conviction of  a  felony.   8 U.S.C.   \n\n1326(b)(1).\n\n          When   sentencing  Mendez,   the  district   court\n\ncalculated a Sentencing  Guidelines offense level of  6 (the\n\n\"unlawful  entry\"  base  offense  level  of  8,  U.S.S.G.   \n\n2L1.2(a),    minus   two    levels   for    \"acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility,\" id.   3E1.1(a)).  It calculated  a Criminal\n                    \n\nHistory  Category of  III,  reflecting six  criminal history\n\npoints:  three points for the prior felony conviction, id.  \n                                                          \n\n4A1.1(a), plus three points for committing the present crime\n\nwhile on supervised release and within  two years of release\n\nfrom an  earlier prison  term, id.    4A1.1(d), (e).   These\n                                  \n\ncalculations produced a  Guideline Sentence range of  two to\n\neight months imprisonment.   Id. ch.  5, part A  (Sentencing\n                                \n\nTable).    The court  then  departed  from that  range,  and\n\nimposed a prison term of 24 months.   Mendez appeals the 24-\n\nmonth  sentence  on  the  ground  that  the  court's  upward\n\ndeparture was \"unreasonable.\"  18 U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).  W  e\n\nagree with  Mendez that, at least, the  law requires greater\n\nexplanation  for this  departure than  the sentencing  court\n\nprovided.   We vacate Mendez'  sentence and remand  the case\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n          We have said that we normally review departures by\n\nexamining  (1)  whether  the  reasons  the  court  gave  for\n\ndeparting are of  the sort that might permit  a departure in\n\nan  appropriate  case;  (2) whether  the  record  supports a\n\nfinding  of  facts  demonstrating   the  existence  of  such\n\nreasons; and (3)  whether, given the reasons,  the degree of\n\ndeparture  is reasonable.   United States v. Diaz-Villafane,\n                                                           \n\n874  F.2d 43,  49 (1st  Cir.),  cert. denied,  493 U.S.  862\n                                            \n\n(1989); United States v. Rivera,  994 F.2d 942, 950-52  (1st\n                               \n\nCir. 1993).  \n\n          In this case, the district court departed from the\n\nGuideline sentence for  a proper reason.  At  the sentencing\n\nhearing, the court stated that \n\n          pursuant  to  information  obtained from\n          the U.S. Immigration  and Naturalization\n          Service . . . , the defendant is a well-\n          known  alien   smuggler  who   had  been\n          arrested on previous occasions, although\n          not convicted,  and these  circumstances\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          leads  [sic] me  to the  conclusion that\n          the defendant's  criminal history  score\n          is under-represented,  and therefore  an\n          upward   adjustment   or   departure  is\n          warranted pursuant  to Guidelines  5K2.0\n          and 4A1.3,  and I  say specifically  the\n          reason  for  the   upward  departure  is\n          because  his criminal  history score  is\n          under-represented.\n\nWe have observed  that the Guidelines classify  some reasons\n\nfor departure as \"encouraged,\" \"discouraged,\" or \"forbidden\"\n\nreasons,  Rivera, 994 F.2d  at 948-49, and  they \"encourage\"\n                \n\ndeparture when a defendant's Criminal History Category\n\n          does   not   adequately    reflect   the\n          seriousness  of  the   defendant's  past\n          criminal conduct or  the likelihood that\n          the defendant will commit other crimes.\n\nU.S.S.G.    4A1.3 (p.s.).  \"Reliable information\" concerning\n\n\"prior similar  adult conduct  not resulting  in a  criminal\n\nconviction\" may justify  such a departure.  Id.    4A1.3(e).\n                                               \n\nTherefore,  the  first  part  of  Diaz-Villafane's  test  is\n                                                \n\nsatisfied.\n\n          As  to  the  second part,  the  record  provides a\n\nsufficient basis  for the district  court's conclusion  that\n\nCriminal History  Category III  was inadequate  in light  of\n\ndefendant's  actual  criminal  history.    The  Pre-Sentence\n\nReport said,\n\n          According  to  information  provided  by\n          USINS  Anti-Smuggling,  S/A  Joe Rivera,\n          defendant is a well known alien smuggler\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          and is  associated with one  of the most\n          powerful  alien  smuggling organizations\n          in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States Attorney  recommended an upward  departure\n\nbecause, in her view, the defendant's criminal history score\n\ntook  account  of  only  one  of  several  earlier,  illegal\n\nactions.  She told the court that his score did not \n\n          take[]  into  consideration  . .  .  all\n          those  other occasions when he has . . .\n          been known  to bring in  aliens and  the\n          other occasions .  . . for which  he has\n          been deported.\n\nThe defendant did  not controvert these statements,  nor did\n\nhe   deny  the  existence  of  \"other  occasions\"  of  alien\n\nsmuggling.   Consequently, the  district court's  finding of\n\ncircumstances   warranting   departure   was   not   clearly\n\nerroneous.   See 18  U.S.C.    3742(e); Diaz-Villafane,  874\n                                                      \n\nF.2d at 49.\n\n          Nonetheless, the extent of the departure creates a\n\nproblem.    Normally,  where an  offense  level  is  6, even\n\noffenders with the highest criminal history scores (those in\n\nCriminal  History Category VI)  cannot be sentenced  to more\n\nthan  18  months in  prison.   See  U.S.S.G. ch.  5,  part A\n                                  \n\n(Sentencing  Table) (attached here as an Appendix).  Mendez,\n\nhowever, received a  24-month sentence.  The  problem arises\n\nbecause the same  Guideline policy statement  that describes\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nwhen the court  should depart because of a  Criminal History\n    \n\nCategory's inadequacy, also  describes how the  court should\n                                          \n\ndepart.    The  Guideline's   policy  statement  puts   this\n\ndirection in the following language:\n\n          In  considering a  departure under  this\n          provision, the  Commission intends  that\n          the  court  use,  as  a  reference,  the\n          guideline range  for a defendant  with a\n          higher   or   lower   criminal   history\n          category, as  applicable.   For example,\n          if   the   court  concludes   that   the\n          defendant's criminal history category of\n          III  significantly  under-represents the\n          seriousness of the  defendant's criminal\n          history, and that the seriousness of the\n          defendant's   criminal   history    most\n          closely   resembles    that   of    most\n          defendants    with   Criminal    History\n          Category IV,  the court  should look  to\n          the  guideline  range  specified  for  a\n          defendant with Criminal History Category\n          IV  to   guide  its   departure.     The\n                                                  \n          Commission contemplates that  there may,\n                                                  \n          on occasion, be a  case of an egregious,\n                                                  \n          serious  criminal record  in which  even\n                                                  \n          the guideline range for Criminal History\n                                                  \n          Category VI  is not adequate  to reflect\n                                                  \n          the  seriousness   of  the   defendant's\n                                                  \n          criminal  history.   In such  a  case, a\n                           \n          departure above the  guideline range for\n          a   defendant   with   Criminal  History\n          Category  VI may  be  warranted. .  .  .\n          [Where  that is  so,]  the court  should\n          structure     departure     by    moving\n          incrementally down the  sentencing table\n          to  the  next  higher offense  level  in\n          Criminal  History Category  VI until  it\n          finds a  guideline range  appropriate to\n          the case.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nId.    4A1.3  (p.s.) (emphasis  added).   In  essence,  this\n   \n\nstatement says  that  the  court  should  move  horizontally\n\nacross  the Sentencing  Table,  looking  from  one  Criminal\n\nHistory Category  to the next,  until it finds  the Category\n\nthat best suits the circumstances.  See, e.g., United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Aymelek, 926  F.2d 64, 70 (1st  Cir. 1991).  If  even the\n          \n\nhighest  category, Category VI,  is not sufficiently severe,\n\nthen the court should move vertically from one offense level\n\nto another,  until  it  finds  the  appropriate  punishment.\n\nHowever, the court should depart beyond Category VI only \"on\n                                                            \n\noccasion,\"  in the case  of an \"egregious,  serious criminal\n                                                            \n\nrecord.\"  U.S.S.G.   4A1.3 (p.s.) (emphasis added).\n      \n\n          The upshot  is that  insofar as  a district  court\n\nfollows  the   policy  statement's  methodology   by  moving\n\nhorizontally  across  the  Sentencing  Table, the  statement\n\nprovides an \"encouraged\" departure, which an appellate court\n\nwill rarely set aside.   Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948 (sentencing\n                               \n\ncourt \"can  feel confident,  because of  this encouragement,\n\nthat  a departure would  not be 'unreasonable'\").   However,\n\nthe same  policy statement \"discourage[s]\"  departures based\n                               \n\nsolely  on  criminal  history that  exceed  the  Category VI\n\nsentence,  unless the  defendant's  record (beyond  what his\n\ncriminal  history points already  show) is \"egregious.\"   We\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nhave  held  that a  court  may  sometimes  depart despite  a\n\nGuideline \"discouragement.\"   Id. (where  Guidelines provide\n                                 \n\nthat  family  circumstances  \"ordinarily\"   do  not  warrant\n\ndeparture, court  may depart  if unusual  circumstances make\n\nthe case \"not at all 'ordinary'\"); see, e.g.,  United States\n                                                            \n\nv.  Emery,  991 F.2d  907,  913 (1st  Cir.  1993) (upholding\n         \n\ndeparture above Category VI for unusually egregious criminal\n\nrecord).  However, when undertaking a discouraged departure,\n\nthe sentencing court must  focus upon the issue  and explain\n\ncarefully why  the circumstances, which ordinarily would not\n\nsupport the  departure, are  special enough  to warrant  the\n\ndeparture  in the case  before it.  See  Rivera, 994 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n951  (\"Were a district  court . .  . to try to  depart for a\n\n'discouraged'  reason  without  recognizing  that  it   must\n                                                            \n\nexplain  how the  case (compared  to other  cases  where the\n                                                            \n\nreason  is present) is  special, its departure  would not be\n                               \n\nlawful.\"); Emery,  991 F.2d at  913 (noting that  court gave\n                \n\n\"specific  reasons\" why  defendant's record  was worse  than\n\nthat of most Category VI offenders).\n\n          In  this  case,  although  the  sentencing   court\n\nproperly explained why it was departing, it did not  explain\n\nwhy a departure  created by moving horizontally  to Criminal\n\nHistory Category IV, V, or VI (with an 18-month maximum) was\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nnot  enough   to  remedy  the   Guideline  Criminal  History\n\nCategory's  inadequacy.   It did  not explain  why, in  that\n\nrespect, the case is special or \"egregious.\"  \n\n          In the absence of any such explanation, and in the\n\nface of a  record that is silent as to the specifics of past\n\nbad  behavior, Mendez's past would  seem to justify only the\n\nhorizontal sort of departure \"encouraged\"  by   4A1.3.

It calculated a Criminal History Category of III, reflecting six criminal history points:  three points for the prior felony conviction, id.

The Pre-Sentence Report said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>According to information provided by USINS Anti-Smuggling, S/A Joe Rivera, defendant is a well known alien smuggler and is associated with one of the most powerful alien smuggling organizations in the Dominican Republic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Attorney recommended an upward departure because, in her view, the defendant's criminal history score took account of only one of several earlier, illegal actions.  She told the court that his score did not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>take[ ] into consideration ... all those other occasions when he has ... been known to bring in aliens and the other occasions ... for which he has been deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant did not controvert these statements, nor did he deny the existence of \"other occasions\" of alien smuggling.  Consequently, the district court's finding of circumstances warranting departure was not clearly erroneous.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e);  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the extent of the departure creates a problem.  Normally, where an offense level is 6, even offenders with the highest criminal history scores (those in Criminal History Category VI) cannot be sentenced to more than 18 months in prison.  See U.S.S.G. ch. 5, part A (Sentencing Table) (attached here as an Appendix).  Mendez, however, received a 24-month sentence.  The problem arises because the same Guideline policy statement that describes when the court should depart because of a Criminal History Category's inadequacy, also describes how the court should depart.  The Guideline's policy statement puts this direction in the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>In considering a departure under this provision, the Commission intends that the court use, as a reference, the guideline range for a defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as applicable.  For example, if the court concludes that the defendant's criminal history category of III significantly under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history, and that the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history most closely resembles that of most defendants with Criminal History Category IV, the court should look to the guideline range specified for a defendant with Criminal History Category IV to guide its departure.  The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history.   In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted....  [Where that is so,] the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Sec. 4A1.3 (p.s.)  (emphasis added).  In essence, this statement says that the court should move horizontally across the Sentencing Table, looking from one Criminal History Category to the next, until it finds the Category that best suits the circumstances.  See, e.g., United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 70 (1st Cir.1991).  If even the highest category, Category VI, is not sufficiently severe, then the court should move vertically from one offense level to another, until it finds the appropriate punishment.  However, the court should depart beyond Category VI only \"on occasion,\" in the case of an \"egregious, serious criminal record.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3 (p.s.)  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that insofar as a district court follows the policy statement's methodology by moving horizontally across the Sentencing Table, the statement provides an \"encouraged\" departure, which an appellate court will rarely set aside.  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948 (sentencing court \"can feel confident, because of this encouragement, that a departure would not be 'unreasonable' \").  However, the same policy statement \"disurage[s]\" departures based solely on criminal history that exceed the Category VI sentence, unless the defendant's record (beyond what his criminal history points already show) is \"egregious.\"   We have held that a court may sometimes depart despite a Guideline \"discouragement.\"   Id. (where Guidelines provide that family circumstances \"ordinarily\" do not warrant departure, court may depart if unusual circumstances make the case \"not at all 'ordinary' \");  see, e.g., United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding departure above Category VI for unusually egregious criminal record).  However, when undertaking a discouraged departure, the sentencing court must focus upon the issue and explain carefully why the circumstances, which ordinarily would not support the departure, are special enough to warrant the departure in the case before it.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951 (\"Were a district court ... to try to depart for a 'discouraged' reason without recognizing that it must explain how the case (compared to other cases where the reason is present) is special, its departure would not be lawful.\");  Emery, 991 F.2d at 913 (noting that court gave \"specific reasons\" why defendant's record was worse than that of most Category VI offenders).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, although the sentencing court properly explained why it was departing, it did not explain why a departure created by moving horizontally to Criminal History Category IV, V, or VI (with an 18-month maximum) was not enough to remedy the Guideline Criminal History Category's inadequacy.  It did not explain why, in that respect, the case is special or \"egregious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of any such explanation, and in the face of a record that is silent as to the specifics of past bad behavior, Mendez's past would seem to justify only the horizontal sort of departure \"encouraged\" by Sec. 4A1.3.  The court has not provided any other basis for departure.  Cf. United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1991) (departure beyond Category VI sentence justified because defendant's present offense involved risk to life on ship of which he was captain, allowing a Sec. 5K2.0 departure in addition to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure).  Consequently, we remand the case for further consideration of defendant's sentence.

(where Guidelines provide that family circumstances \"ordinarily\" do not warrant departure, court may depart if unusual circumstances make the case \"not at all 'ordinary' \");  see, e.g., United States v. Emery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605526\"><a href=\"/opinion/605526/united-states-v-charles-e-emery/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 913 (1st Cir.1993) (upholding departure above Category VI for unusually egregious criminal record).  However, when undertaking a discouraged departure, the sentencing court must focus upon the issue and explain carefully why the circumstances, which ordinarily would not support the departure, are special enough to warrant the departure in the case before it.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951 (\"Were a district court ... to try to depart for a 'discouraged' reason without recognizing that it must explain how the case (compared to other cases where the reason is present) is special, its departure would not be lawful.\");  Emery, 991 F.2d at 913 (noting that court gave \"specific reasons\" why defendant's record was worse than that of most Category VI offenders).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, although the sentencing court properly explained why it was departing, it did not explain why a departure created by moving horizontally to Criminal History Category IV, V, or VI (with an 18-month maximum) was not enough to remedy the Guideline Criminal History Category's inadequacy.  It did not explain why, in that respect, the case is special or \"egregious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of any such explanation, and in the face of a record that is silent as to the specifics of past bad behavior, Mendez's past would seem to justify only the horizontal sort of departure \"encouraged\" by Sec. 4A1.3.  The court has not provided any other basis for departure.  Cf. United States v. Figaro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562319\"><a href=\"/opinion/562319/united-states-v-porfirio-johnson-figaro/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991) (departure beyond Category VI sentence justified because defendant's present offense involved risk to life on ship of which he was captain, allowing a Sec. 5K2.0 departure in addition to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure).  Consequently, we remand the case for further consideration of defendant's sentence.  The parties remain free to supplement the record at a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.APPENDIX</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
