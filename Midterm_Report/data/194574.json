This case  requires that we\n                                   \n\ndecide whether a party who loses on the only litigated claim, but\n\nachieves   the  relief   sought  as   a  result   of  intervening\n\ncongressional action prior to  a ruling by the district  court on\n\nthe remaining grounds in  the complaint, can nevertheless recover\n\nattorney's  fees.   We  hold  that,  in  appropriate  cases,  the\n\ndistrict court may award  attorney's fees.  Because we  find this\n\nto be  such a case, we  reverse the district court  ruling to the\n\ncontrary, and remand for action consistent with this opinion. \n\n                               I  \n\n                           BACKGROUND1\n                           BACKGROUND\n                                     \n\n          Appellants,  a  group  of  very  low  income  families,\n\nchallenged a  tenant selection  scheme at  the Chad Brown  public\n\nhousing  project in Providence, Rhode Island.  In the late 1970s,\n\nthe Department of Housing  and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and  the\n\nProvidence  Housing Authority  (\"PHA\") hired  Corcoran Management\n\nCo.,  Inc. (\"Corcoran\")  to  supervise the  modernization of  the\n\nproject.    In  order to  achieve  an  economic  mix of  tenants,\n\nCorcoran, with HUD's approval, attempted to implement a plan that\n\nwould  skip-over very low income families on the waiting list and\n\nsettle higher income families first.  \n\n          In 1986, appellants  sought declaratory and  injunctive\n\nrelief against both HUD and Corcoran.  The complaint alleged that\n\nHUD's adoption  of the income  mixing scheme violated  the United\n\nStates Housing Act of 1937  (\"Housing Act\"), 42 U.S.C.   1437  et\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n1  The facts underlying this case are detailed at  Paris v.

Appellants\n\nalso  brought a claim against Corcoran under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for\n\nviolation  of  their  civil  rights  on  the same  statutory  and\n\nconstitutional grounds.  The district court granted a preliminary\n\ninjunction  based  on  the  Housing  Act  claim.    We  reversed,\n\nexpressly leaving  the other  issues open for  resolution by  the\n\ndistrict court.  Paris I, 843 F.2d at 574 n.20.  \n                        \n\n          In the  summer of 1988, Congress passed  the Stewart B.\n\nMcKinney Homeless  Assistance Amendments Act  of 1988.   This law\n\nprohibited public  housing agencies from by-passing  the order of\n\nthe  waiting  list for  the  purpose of  assisting  higher income\n\nfamilies first.2  The Conference Report stated that, \"[w]hile the\n\nconferees affirm  the principle of income mix in assisted housing\n\nprojects,  this  amendment (which  is necessary  in light  of the\n                                                                 \n\ndecision in Paris v. HUD, 843 F.2d 561) makes it clear that lower\n                                      \n\nincome families  on a  waiting list  may not be  skipped over  in\n\n                    \n\n2  The act provided in relevant part:  \n\n            Sec.  1001.

No.\n\n1089,  100th Cong.,  2d  Sess. 91-92  (1988),  reprinted in  1988\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 4450, 4475-76 (emphasis supplied).  HUD and Corcoran\n\namended  the income  mixing plan  to conform  to  these statutory\n\nchanges.    Appellants moved  for  a  voluntary dismissal  having\n\nachieved  their goal.    The district  court  dismissed the  suit\n\nwithout reaching the other legal issues in the case.\n\n          In 1990,  appellants moved for an  attorney's fee award\n\nagainst  HUD under the Equal  Access to Justice  Act (\"EAJA\"), 28\n\nU.S.C.     2412(d)(1)(A), and  the  Fair Housing  Act,  42 U.S.C.\n\n  3613(c)(2).   Appellants  similarly sought  fees from  Corcoran\n\nunder the Civil  Rights Attorney's  Fees Awards Act  of 1976,  42\n\nU.S.C.    1988, and  the Fair  Housing Act.   The  district court\n\nrejected  the claim under  the EAJA finding  that appellants were\n\nnot \"prevailing  parties\" and  that the government's  position in\n\nthe  litigation  was  \"substantially   justified.\"    It  refused\n\nrecovery under the Fair Housing Act and   1988, reasoning that it\n\ncould  not award fees pursuant to those statutes unless the party\n\nprevails on those claims.  Since appellants voluntarily dismissed\n\nthe action  before the court  considered those issues,  the court\n\ndenied the fee request. \n\n                                II\n\n                            EAJA CLAIM\n                                      \n\n          A party seeking  attorney's fees under    2412(d)(1)(A)\n\nof the EAJA must demonstrate that it is  a \"prevailing party\" and\n\n                               -4-\n\nthat   the   government's   position   was   not   \"substantially\n\njustified.\"3   The  prevailing party  inquiry under  the EAJA  is\n\nconsistent with that  under other federal fee-shifting  statutes.\n\nTexas State  Teachers Ass'n v. Garland  Independent School Dist.,\n                                                                \n\n489 U.S. 782, 784 (1989); Guglietti v.

In general, the  court looks for some\n\n\"material alteration of the legal relationship  of the parties in\n\na  manner which Congress sought  to promote in  the fee statute.\"\n\nTexas Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93; see also Farrar v. Hobby, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 566, 572-73 (1992).   We have identified two main  avenues\n\nby which a party may  demonstrate the changed legal relationship.\n\nThe party either must enjoy bottom-line success in the litigation\n\nor  act  as   a  catalyst  in  causing  the  desired  alteration.\n\nGuglietti,  900 F.2d at 400-01; Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275,\n                                                  \n\n278-79 (1st  Cir. 1978).  Unlike other fee-shifting statutes, the\n\nEAJA  presents   the  additional  hurdle  of   showing  that  the\n\ngovernment's position was  not substantially justified.   Compare\n                                                                 \n\n42 U.S.C.   1988(b) (Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act) and\n                                                                 \n\n42  U.S.C.    3613(c)(2)  (Fair Housing  Act)  with 28  U.S.C.   \n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n3  28 U.S.C.   2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp. 1992) provides:\n\n            Except as otherwise specifically provided\n            by  statute, a  court  shall  award to  a\n            prevailing  party  other than  the United\n            States  fees and  other expenses,  in any\n            civil action (other  than cases  sounding\n            in   tort),  including   proceedings  for\n            judicial review of agency  action, unless\n            the court finds that the position  of the\n            United States was substantially justified\n            or  that  special  circumstances make  an\n            award unjust.\n\n                               -5-\n\n2412(d)(1)(A) (EAJA). \n\n          We  review the  district court's  prevailing party  and\n\nsubstantial  justification  determinations  under  the  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  standard.  Pierce v.  Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 558-63\n                                           \n\n(1988)  (substantial justification);    McDonald v.  Secretary of\n                                                                 \n\nHHS, 884 F.2d 1468 (1st Cir. 1989) (prevailing party).   When the\n   \n\ndistrict  court  errs  with  respect  to a  purely  legal  issue,\n\nhowever, our  review is de novo.  Domegan v. Ponte, 972 F.2d 401,\n                                                  \n\n406-07 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 399.\n                                          \n\n          For the  moment we shall postpone  consideration of the\n\ndistrict  court's  finding  on  prevailing  party status  because\n\nappellants'  claim under the EAJA is  dispensed with easily under\n\nthe  substantial  justification  prong  of  the  EAJA  fee  award\n\ninquiry.  Appellants predicate their EAJA claim  on their alleged\n\nsuccess  on  the  substantive Housing  Act  claim.    Because the\n\nHousing  Act  does  not  have  its  own  fee-shifting  provision,\n\nappellants were  forced to  seek fees under  the general  federal\n\nfee-shifting statute, the EAJA.  HUD and Corcoran's position with\n\nrespect to the  Housing Act  was clearly justified  prior to  the\n\nMcKinney  Amendments.    Indeed,  this court  agreed  with  their\n\ninterpretation  of the Housing Act  in Paris I.   Congress' later\n                                              \n\naction does not alter  our conclusion.  Thus, the  district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying attorney's fees under the\n\nEAJA.\n\n                               III\n\n                FAIR HOUSING ACT AND SECTION 1988\n                                                 \n\n                               -6-\n\n          Unlike the  EAJA, neither  the Fair Housing  Act's fee-\n\nshifting provision,4  nor section 1988,5 require  that appellants\n\ndemonstrate that the government's position  was not substantially\n\njustified.   The  district court  rejected appellants'  arguments\n\nreasoning that success  on these  claims, by which  it must  have\n\nmeant--judicial  consideration prior  to success that  mooted the\n\ncourt  proceedings--was  the sine  qua non  of  an award  of fees\n                                          \n\npursuant  to  these   statutes.    HUD  and  Corcoran   make  the\n\nsuperficially appealing argument that fees cannot be awarded to a\n\nparty  who lost  on the only  issue that  was litigated.   We are\n\nunpersuaded.\n\n          In Maher  v. Gagne, 448  U.S. 122  (1980), the  Supreme\n                            \n\nCourt considered whether  a party that sued state officials under\n\nthe Social Security Act, 42  U.S.C.    402(a)(7), 602(a)(7),  and\n\nthe Equal  Protection and Due  Process Clauses of  the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution, but settled the case\n\n                    \n\n4    The  Fair  Housing Act  fee-shifting  provision,  42  U.S.C.\n  3613(c)(2) (Supp. 1992) provides in relevant part:\n\n            [T]he court, in its discretion, may allow\n            the  prevailing  party,  other  than  the\n            United  States,  a reasonable  attorney's\n            fee and costs.   The United States  shall\n            be liable for such  fees and costs to the\n            same extent as a private person.\n\n5  42 U.S.C.   1988 (b) (Supp. 1992) provides:  \n\n            In any action or proceeding  to enforce a\n            provision of section[]  . . . 1983  . . .\n            the court, in  its discretion, may  allow\n            the  prevailing  party,  other  than  the\n            United  States,  a reasonable  attorney's\n            fee as part of the costs.\n\n                               -7-\n\nby  entry of  a  consent decree  prior  to determination  by  the\n\ndistrict  court of  whether  her constitutional  rights had  been\n\nviolated,  could  recover attorney's  fees  under  section 1988.6\n\nThe  court held that the district court's power to award fees was\n\nnot  conditioned  on  \"full litigation  of  the  issues  or on  a\n\njudicial  determination  that the  plaintiff's  rights have  been\n\nviolated.\"   Maher, 448  U.S.  at 129.    The Court  stated  that\n                  \n\n\"Congress   intended  fees   to  be   awarded  where   a  pendent\n\nconstitutional claim is involved, even  if the statutory claim on\n\nwhich the plaintiff  prevailed is  one for which  fees cannot  be\n\nawarded  under the  Act.\"7   Id. at  132 n.15.   The  Maher court\n                                                           \n\nrecognized that such a policy provided a perfect  balance between\n\nthe  congressional  policy  of  encouraging  suits  to  vindicate\n\nconstitutional rights and the policy against unnecessary decision\n\nof constitutional questions.  Id. at 133.\n                                 \n\n          The  Court  did  not  intend that  the  district  court\n\nlitigate the merits of the claims once the case had been resolved\n\n                    \n\n6  In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1980), the Court held\n                        \nthat    1988 provides a basis  for awards for any    1983 action,\nincluding those based  on statutory, rather  than, constitutional\nviolations.   In Maher, as here, the unlitigated claims were both\n                      \nstatutory and constitutional. \n\n7  The legislative history accompanying H.R. 15460, a bill almost\nidentical to  that passed stated:   \"if the claim  for which fees\nmay  be awarded meets  the 'substantiality' test,  see Haggans v.\n                                                              \nLavine,  [415 U.S. 528 (1974)]; United Mine Workers v.

United Mine  Workers v.\n                                                              \nGibbs, supra, at 725.\"  Maher, 448 U.S. at 133 n.15 (quoting H.R.\n                             \nRep.

On the contrary, the Court has\n\ncautioned  against such  wasteful  secondary  litigation.   Texas\n                                                                 \n\nTeachers, 489  U.S. at 791.   In Haggans v. Lavine,  415 U.S. 528\n                                                  \n\n(1974), the Court  developed a \"substantiality\" test to aid lower\n\ncourts in determining when it is appropriate for them to exercise\n\njurisdiction over  statutory  causes  of  action  that,  although\n\npendent  to  constitutional  claims  over  which  the  court  has\n\njurisdiction, have  no independent jurisdictional basis.   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n542.   Applied in this different context, the Haggans test serves\n                                                     \n\nas a proxy for determination on the merits of the claims once the\n\nlitigation is resolved to establish  that an attorney's fee award\n\nis  justified.   The  threshold \"substantiality\"  test  conserves\n\njudicial  resources while  continuing to require  that plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrate that their success is sufficiently related to a civil\n\nrights victory before receiving fees under a fee-shifting regime.\n\n          In  Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Supreme\n                               \n\nCourt clarified principles implicit  in Maher, by explaining that\n                                             \n\n\"plaintiffs may not rely simply on the fact that substantial fee-\n\ngenerating claims were made during the course of the litigation.\"\n\nId.  at  1007.   Further  examination  of  the  claims and  their\n   \n\nrelationship  is required.   The  Court specifically  stated that\n\nthere was  nothing  wrong with  seeking  relief under  a  certain\n\nstatute,  or amending a complaint,  to include a  claim for which\n\nattorney's  fees are available.   Id.  at 1009  n.12.   The court\n                                     \n\nconcluded,  however,  that  where  petitioners   \"have  presented\n\n                               -9-\n\ndistinctly  different  claims  for  different  relief,  based  on\n\ndifferent  facts and legal theories, and have prevailed only on a\n\nnonfee claim, they are not entitled to a fee award simply because\n\nthe other claim was a constitutional claim that could be asserted\n\nthrough   1983.\"  Id. at 1015.  \n                     \n\n          This case  does not  present that situation;  the facts\n\narise from a common  nucleus of operative fact, and  the theories\n\nare  but different  statutory  avenues to  the  same goal.    The\n\nappellants are victims of a  happenstance that the district court\n\nopted  to decide on the basis of  the Housing Act claim, and that\n\nthe  appeal proceeded as it did, before Congress intervened.  Nor\n\nare  we presented  with  the situation  in  Smith, in  which  the\n                                                 \n\nSupreme  Court  held  that  one  of  the  several  statutory  and\n\nconstitutional  claims  was  the  exclusive  avenue  of  redress,\n\nthereby  barring  recovery  under  another  fee-shifting  statute\n\nalleged in the complaint.8\n\n          On  the contrary, we think that the principles of Maher\n                                                                 \n\nclearly apply to the  present case.  Maher considered  one manner\n                                          \n\nin  which  cases  are  resolved without  formal  adjudication  or\n\n                    \n\n8  In Smith, plaintiffs asserted  claims based on state law;  the\n           \nEducation of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended,\n20 U.S.C.   1400 et seq.;  section 504 of  the Rehabilitation Act\n                        \nof  1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29  U.S.C.   794; and the Due\nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe  Court  concluded  that  where  a  remedy  was  provided with\n\"clarity  and  precision\"  under the  EHA,  a  plaintiff  may not\ncircumvent  that exclusive  avenue by  appeal to  other statutory\nschemes.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1021.  Congress subsequently altered\n               \nthe Court's specific holding under the EHA to provide fees in the\nHandicapped  Children's Protection Act  of 1986, Pub.  L. No. 99-\n372, 100 Stat. 796, codified at 20 U.S.C.   1415 (Supp. 1992). \n\n                               -10-\n\ndecision  by a  court  on  all  issues  raised  by  the  parties.\n\nVoluntary dismissal is but another way in which a plaintiff saves\n\njudicial resources once it has achieved its desired goal.  \n\n          After a  case is  resolved, by  whatever method, and  a\n\nparty requests attorney's fees, we look for  a \"prevailing party\"\n\nwithin  the meaning  of  term as  spelled  out in  the case  law.\n\nAppellants are not  a \"prevailing  party\" under  the merits  test\n\nsince  the court  never considered  the merits  of the  claims in\n\nissue.  Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206, 1224 (1st Cir. 1991);\n                           \n\nCoalition for Basic Human Needs v.  King, 691 F.2d 597, 599  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1982) (merits  test \"states  the obvious, that  a party  has\n\nprevailed if it wins the litigation\").  Appellants,  however, are\n\na catalyst under Guglietti,  900 F.2d at 401-02, and  Nadeau, 581\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  279-80.  To be a catalyst the party must demonstrate (1)\n\na causal  connection between the litigation and the relief sought\n\nand (2) that the success was not obtained by a gratuitous gesture\n\nof the  fee-target.  Guglietti, 900  F.2d at 401.   The suit need\n                              \n\nnot be the sole cause  but must play a \"provocative\" role or be a\n\n\"competent producing cause.\"  Id.  \n                                 \n\n          The district court summarily determined that appellants\n\nwere not  catalysts because it  believed that  Congress, not  the\n\nlitigation, caused defendants to  change their income mix policy.\n\nWe think this argument is incorrect.\n\n          The  fact  that   Congress  delivered  the  plaintiffs'\n\nrequested relief rather than the parties  sued, HUD and Corcoran,\n\nprovides no  relevant distinction.   Corcoran, HUD,  and Congress\n\n                               -11-\n\nare  manifestations of the same  entity, the government.   HUD is\n\nsimply an instrument  of Congress' will, and  Corcoran does HUD's\n\nbidding.\n\n          The  district  court also  relied  on  our decision  in\n\nGuglietti,  900 F.2d  397,  to deny  appellants prevailing  party\n         \n\nstatus  under the  catalyst  theory.   In Guglietti,  plaintiff's\n                                                   \n\nSocial Security disability benefits  were terminated.   Guglietti\n\nsought  review of  the determination.   While  on appeal  to this\n\ncourt, Congress  amended the statute  and directed that  cases on\n\nappeal,  such as  Guglietti's,  be remanded  for a  determination\n\nunder  the new  statutory  standard.   Under  that standard,  his\n\nbenefits  were reinstated.    Guglietti obtained  attorney's  fee\n\nunder the EAJA in the district court.  On appeal, we reversed the\n\naward.   Guglietti, 900  F.2d at 403.   We  reasoned that because\n                  \n\nplaintiff  was  just  one of  thousands  of  similar  claims, the\n\nrelationship between the litigation  and Congress' action was too\n\ntenuous to be considered  the \"provocative\" cause of legislation.\n\nId. at  401 (relying on Hendricks  v. Bowen, 847  F.2d 1255, 1258\n                                           \n\n(7th Cir.  1988); Truax  v.

Here the Congressional change was wrought by one case,\n\nParis I.    The Conference  Report specifically  states that  the\n       \n\namendments were necessary to  change the result in Paris I.  H.R.\n                                                          \n\nConf. Rep.  No. 1089  at  91-92, see  ante at  p.  3.   Guglietti\n                                                                 \n\nrecognized that  assigning a  particular case among  thousands in\n\n                               -12-\n\nthe context  of social securities benefits strains  the notion of\n\nprovocative cause.   To read Guglietti to  prevent attorney's fee\n                                      \n\nin the present case is to negate the possibility of ever granting\n\nattorney's fees when Congress amends or clarifies legislation and\n\nthereby   secures  plaintiff's  requested   interpretation  of  a\n\nstatute.  Plaintiffs would be forced to choose between litigation\n\nand pursuing legislative changes via lobbying activities, or risk\n\nlosing  an  award of  fees.   Such  an insurmountable  barrier to\n\nrecovery  would  contravene  Congress' intent  in  enacting  fee-\n\nshifting  statutes.   Texas Teachers,  489 U.S.  at 793.   In any\n                                    \n\nevent, this case  sits at the opposite  end of the spectrum  from\n\nGuglietti since  Congress specifically mentioned the  case in the\n         \n\nlegislative  history as  being the  \"necessary\" force  behind its\n\nenactment.  \n\n          Appellants' suit  is, thus,  fairly characterized  as a\n\ncatalyst of Congress'  amendment.   The district  court erred  in\n\nholding  to the contrary.  As such, appellants' law suit affected\n\na \"material alteration  of the legal relationship  of the parties\n\nin a manner which Congress sought to promote\" in the fee-shifting\n\nprovisions  of  the   Fair  Housing  Act  with   respect  to  the\n\ngovernment,  and in     1988 with  respect  to Corcoran.

On remand,\n\nthe  district court must determine two matters.  First, the court\n\nmust   decide  whether   appellants   raised   statutory   and/or\n\nconstitutional  claims that  pass  the \"substantiality\"  test  of\n\n                               -13-\n\nMaher  and Haggans in order to recover under the alternative fee-\n                  \n\nshifting regimes  pursuant to  unlitigated claims.9   Second, the\n\ndistrict  court  must  determine  the  amount  of  fees to  which\n\nappellants are entitled  under Hensley v.

This case  requires that we\n                                   \n\ndecide whether a party who loses on the only litigated claim, but\n\nachieves   the  relief   sought  as   a  result   of  intervening\n\ncongressional action prior to  a ruling by the district  court on\n\nthe remaining grounds in  the complaint, can nevertheless recover\n\nattorney's  fees.   We  hold  that,  in  appropriate  cases,  the\n\ndistrict court may award  attorney's fees.  Because we  find this\n\nto be  such a case, we  reverse the district court  ruling to the\n\ncontrary, and remand for action consistent with this opinion. \n\n                               I  \n\n                           BACKGROUND1\n                           BACKGROUND\n                                     \n\n          Appellants,  a  group  of  very  low  income  families,\n\nchallenged a  tenant selection  scheme at  the Chad Brown  public\n\nhousing  project in Providence, Rhode Island.  In the late 1970s,\n\nthe Department of Housing  and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and  the\n\nProvidence  Housing Authority  (\"PHA\") hired  Corcoran Management\n\nCo.,  Inc.

The  district court\n\nrejected  the claim under  the EAJA finding  that appellants were\n\nnot \"prevailing  parties\" and  that the government's  position in\n\nthe  litigation  was  \"substantially   justified.\"    It  refused\n\nrecovery under the Fair Housing Act and   1988, reasoning that it\n\ncould  not award fees pursuant to those statutes unless the party\n\nprevails on those claims.

Because the\n\nHousing  Act  does  not  have  its  own  fee-shifting  provision,\n\nappellants were  forced to  seek fees under  the general  federal\n\nfee-shifting statute, the EAJA.  HUD and Corcoran's position with\n\nrespect to the  Housing Act  was clearly justified  prior to  the\n\nMcKinney  Amendments.    Indeed,  this court  agreed  with  their\n\ninterpretation  of the Housing Act  in Paris I.

The  district court  rejected appellants'  arguments\n\nreasoning that success  on these  claims, by which  it must  have\n\nmeant--judicial  consideration prior  to success that  mooted the\n\ncourt  proceedings--was  the sine  qua non  of  an award  of fees\n                                          \n\npursuant  to  these   statutes.

Applied in this different context, the Haggans test serves\n                                                     \n\nas a proxy for determination on the merits of the claims once the\n\nlitigation is resolved to establish  that an attorney's fee award\n\nis  justified.   The  threshold \"substantiality\"  test  conserves\n\njudicial  resources while  continuing to require  that plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrate that their success is sufficiently related to a civil\n\nrights victory before receiving fees under a fee-shifting regime.\n\n          In  Smith v.

Further  examination  of  the  claims and  their\n   \n\nrelationship  is required.   The  Court specifically  stated that\n\nthere was  nothing  wrong with  seeking  relief under  a  certain\n\nstatute,  or amending a complaint,  to include a  claim for which\n\nattorney's  fees are available.   Id.  at 1009  n.12.   The court\n                                     \n\nconcluded,  however,  that  where  petitioners   \"have  presented\n\n                               -9-\n\ndistinctly  different  claims  for  different  relief,  based  on\n\ndifferent  facts and legal theories, and have prevailed only on a\n\nnonfee claim, they are not entitled to a fee award simply because\n\nthe other claim was a constitutional claim that could be asserted\n\nthrough   1983.\"  Id. at 1015.  \n                     \n\n          This case  does not  present that situation;  the facts\n\narise from a common  nucleus of operative fact, and  the theories\n\nare  but different  statutory  avenues to  the  same goal.    The\n\nappellants are victims of a  happenstance that the district court\n\nopted  to decide on the basis of  the Housing Act claim, and that\n\nthe  appeal proceeded as it did, before Congress intervened.  Nor\n\nare  we presented  with  the situation  in  Smith, in  which  the\n                                                 \n\nSupreme  Court  held  that  one  of  the  several  statutory  and\n\nconstitutional  claims  was  the  exclusive  avenue  of  redress,\n\nthereby  barring  recovery  under  another  fee-shifting  statute\n\nalleged in the complaint.8\n\n          On  the contrary, we think that the principles of Maher\n                                                                 \n\nclearly apply to the  present case.  Maher considered  one manner\n                                          \n\nin  which  cases  are  resolved without  formal  adjudication  or\n\n                    \n\n8  In Smith, plaintiffs asserted  claims based on state law;  the\n           \nEducation of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended,\n20 U.S.C.   1400 et seq.;  section 504 of  the Rehabilitation Act\n                        \nof  1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29  U.S.C.   794; and the Due\nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe  Court  concluded  that  where  a  remedy  was  provided with\n\"clarity  and  precision\"  under the  EHA,  a  plaintiff  may not\ncircumvent  that exclusive  avenue by  appeal to  other statutory\nschemes.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1021.  Congress subsequently altered\n               \nthe Court's specific holding under the EHA to provide fees in the\nHandicapped  Children's Protection Act  of 1986, Pub.  L. No. 99-\n372, 100 Stat. 796, codified at 20 U.S.C.   1415 (Supp. 1992). \n\n                               -10-\n\ndecision  by a  court  on  all  issues  raised  by  the  parties.\n\nVoluntary dismissal is but another way in which a plaintiff saves\n\njudicial resources once it has achieved its desired goal.  \n\n          After a  case is  resolved, by  whatever method, and  a\n\nparty requests attorney's fees, we look for  a \"prevailing party\"\n\nwithin  the meaning  of  term as  spelled  out in  the case  law.\n\nAppellants are not  a \"prevailing  party\" under  the merits  test\n\nsince  the court  never considered  the merits  of the  claims in\n\nissue.

While  on appeal  to this\n\ncourt, Congress  amended the statute  and directed that  cases on\n\nappeal,  such as  Guglietti's,  be remanded  for a  determination\n\nunder  the new  statutory  standard.   Under  that standard,  his\n\nbenefits  were reinstated.    Guglietti obtained  attorney's  fee\n\nunder the EAJA in the district court.  On appeal, we reversed the\n\naward.   Guglietti, 900  F.2d at 403.   We  reasoned that because\n                  \n\nplaintiff  was  just  one of  thousands  of  similar  claims, the\n\nrelationship between the litigation  and Congress' action was too\n\ntenuous to be considered  the \"provocative\" cause of legislation.\n\nId. at  401 (relying on Hendricks  v.

To read Guglietti to  prevent attorney's fee\n                                      \n\nin the present case is to negate the possibility of ever granting\n\nattorney's fees when Congress amends or clarifies legislation and\n\nthereby   secures  plaintiff's  requested   interpretation  of  a\n\nstatute.  Plaintiffs would be forced to choose between litigation\n\nand pursuing legislative changes via lobbying activities, or risk\n\nlosing  an  award of  fees.   Such  an insurmountable  barrier to\n\nrecovery  would  contravene  Congress' intent  in  enacting  fee-\n\nshifting  statutes.   Texas Teachers,  489 U.S.  at 793.   In any\n                                    \n\nevent, this case  sits at the opposite  end of the spectrum  from\n\nGuglietti since  Congress specifically mentioned the  case in the\n         \n\nlegislative  history as  being the  \"necessary\" force  behind its\n\nenactment.  \n\n          Appellants' suit  is, thus,  fairly characterized  as a\n\ncatalyst of Congress'  amendment.   The district  court erred  in\n\nholding  to the contrary.  As such, appellants' law suit affected\n\na \"material alteration  of the legal relationship  of the parties\n\nin a manner which Congress sought to promote\" in the fee-shifting\n\nprovisions  of  the   Fair  Housing  Act  with   respect  to  the\n\ngovernment,  and in     1988 with  respect  to Corcoran.

On remand,\n\nthe  district court must determine two matters.  First, the court\n\nmust   decide  whether   appellants   raised   statutory   and/or\n\nconstitutional  claims that  pass  the \"substantiality\"  test  of\n\n                               -13-\n\nMaher  and Haggans in order to recover under the alternative fee-\n                  \n\nshifting regimes  pursuant to  unlitigated claims.9   Second, the\n\ndistrict  court  must  determine  the  amount  of  fees to  which\n\nappellants are entitled  under Hensley v.
