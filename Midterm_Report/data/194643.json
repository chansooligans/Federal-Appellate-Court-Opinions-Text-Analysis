In  this appeal,  several\n                                   \n\nfishing associations,1 appellants here,  request that we vacate a\n\nconsent decree approved and entered by the district court between\n\nthe  Conservation  Law  Foundation   of  New  England,  Inc.  and\n\nMassachusetts Audubon Society (collectively, \"Conservation\"), and\n\nthe Secretary  of Commerce (\"Secretary\").   For the  reasons that\n\nfollow, we reject this request.\n\n                        PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                         \n\n          Conservation  sued  the  Secretary  alleging  that  the\n\nSecretary failed  to prevent  overfishing  off the  coast of  New\n\nEngland, as  required by the Fishery  Management and Conservation\n\nAct of  1976, as amended, 16  U.S.C.    1801-1882   (1985 &amp; Supp.\n\n1992) (\"Magnuson  Act\").   Appellants sought  to intervene.   The\n\ndistrict  court  denied  the  request,  but  we   granted  it  in\n\nConservation Law  Foundation, Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39 (1st\n                                               \n\nCir. 1992).  While  the appeal seeking intervention  was pending,\n\nthe district court entered  a consent decree between Conservation\n\nand the Secretary.   Appellants  now seek to  vacate the  consent\n\ndecree  on  various grounds.    To fully  understand  the present\n\nappeal, we  must briefly describe  the statutory context  to this\n\nsuit.\n\n                       STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n                                           \n\n          Congress  enacted  the  Magnuson  Act  to  establish  a\n\n                    \n\n1  These  associations include:   Associated Fisheries of  Maine,\nN.E.; Atlantic  Swordfish Net Ass'n, Inc.;  Massachusetts Inshore\nDraggermen's   Ass'n,   Inc.;   and   Point   Judith  Fishermen's\nCooperative Ass'n, Inc.\n\n                               -3-\n\ncomprehensive system  of fisheries  management for  waters within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the  United States.  16 U.S.C.    1801(b)(1).\n\nIn particular,  Congress found that  certain stocks  of fish  had\n\nbeen so overfished that  their survival was threatened, id.  at  \n                                                           \n\n1801(a)(2), and mandated that overfishing be prevented,  id. at  \n                                                            \n\n1851(a)(1). \n\n          To attain  these goals, the Act  creates eight regional\n\nfishery management councils.   Id.  at   1852(a).   The  regional\n                                  \n\ncouncils are comprised of state and federal government officials,\n\nas  well  as  individuals   nominated  by  state  executives  and\n\nappointed by the Secretary.  Id. at   1852(b), (c).  The Magnuson\n                                \n\nAct  charges  the  Secretary  and the  Councils  with  developing\n\nfishery management plans (\"FMPs\") for stocks of fish within their\n\njurisdictions that require conservation  and management.  The Act\n\nspecifies the  procedures by which FMPs are developed and creates\n\na number of standards to which  the plans must conform.  National\n\nStandard   One  requires  that   \"[c]onservation  and  management\n\nmeasures   shall  prevent  overfishing   while  achieving,  on  a\n\ncontinuing  basis, the  optimum yield from  each fishery  for the\n\nUnited  States  fishing industry.\"   Id.  at    1851(a)(1).   The\n                                        \n\nSecretary  has issued  guidelines  to assist  the development  of\n\nplans by the regional councils.  See 50 C.F.R. pt. 602. \n                                    \n\n          The  Act  provides  that  either the  councils  or  the\n\nSecretary  can develop FMPs.  If a  council generates a plan, the\n\nSecretary  must  follow  a  detailed  procedure  for  review,  as\n\nspecified in    1854(a), (b).   The Secretary  first reviews  the\n\n                               -4-\n\nplan for compliance with  statutory mandates and publishes notice\n\nof the  plan in  the Federal  Register, soliciting  comments from\n\ninterested  persons.   After review,  the Secretary  may approve,\n\npartially  approve, or  disapprove the  plan.   If  the Secretary\n\ndisapproves  or partially disapproves  of a plan  she must inform\n\nthe council of her reasons.  16 U.S.C.   1854(b)(2).  The council\n\nmay then  submit a revised plan,  id. at    1854(b)(3), which the\n                                     \n\nSecretary will review.\n\n          The Act authorizes the Secretary to develop an FMP with\n\nrespect to any fishery  if (1) \"the appropriate council  fails to\n\ndevelop and submit to the Secretary, after a reasonable period of\n                                                                 \n\ntime,  a  fishery  management  plan  for  such  fishery,  or  any\n    \n\nnecessary  amendment to  such a  plan, if  such  fishery requires\n\nconservation  and  management .  . .  ,\"  id. at    1854(c)(1)(A)\n                                             \n\n(emphasis added); or (2)  \"the Secretary disapproves or partially\n\ndisapproves any such plan or amendment,  or disapproves a revised\n\nplan or amendment,  and the  Council involved fails  to submit  a\n\nrevised or further  revised plan  or amendment, as  the case  may\n\nbe.\"   Id. at   1854(c)(1)(B).  Under either statutory authority,\n          \n\nthe  Secretary must submit the FMP to the appropriate council for\n\ncomments,  and publish  notice  of the  plan  and regulations  to\n\nimplement  the  plan  in   the  Federal  Register.    Id.   at   \n                                                         \n\n1854(c)(2)(A).   Before  the Secretary  implements the  plan, she\n\nmust consider the  comments of  the council and  the public,  and\n\nensure  compliance   with  the   national  standards.     Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n   1854(c)(2)(B), 1851, 1853.\n\n                               -5-\n\n          Approved   FMPs   are   implemented    by   regulations\n\npromulgated  by  the Secretary,  which  are  subject to  judicial\n\nreview in accordance with select provisions of the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C.   701 et seq.  See 16 U.S.C.   1855(b). \n                                           \n\n       HISTORY OF THE NORTHEAST MULTISPECIES FISHERIES PLAN\n                                                           \n\n          This case involves  the conservation and  management of\n\ngroundfish  off the  coast of  New England.2    In its  effort to\n\nmanage New England fisheries,  the New England Fishery Management\n\nCouncil (\"New England Council\")  first eliminated foreign fishing\n\nwithin its jurisdiction, 42 Fed. Reg. 13,998 (1977).  In 1985, it\n\ndeveloped the  Northeast  Multispecies Fisheries  Plan,  Proposed\n\nRule, 50 Fed. Reg. 49,582 (1985), because overfishing  remained a\n\nproblem.   The Secretary approved the plan  as an interim rule in\n\n1986,  indicating  that  the   rule  improved  matters,  but  was\n\nunsatisfactory  for   long  term  conservation   and  management.\n\nInterim Rule, 51  Fed. Reg. 29,642, 29,643 (1986).   In 1987, the\n\nrule became final and three amendments followed.  See Final Rule,\n                                                     \n\n52 Fed. Reg. 35,093  (1987) (amendment one); Final Rule,  54 Fed.\n\nReg.  4,798  (1989) (amendment  two);  Final Rule,  54  Fed. Reg.\n\n52,803 (1989) (amendment three).\n\n          The  Rule   and  its   amendments  did  not   eliminate\n\noverfishing as required  by National Standard  One.  Pursuant  to\n\nthe Secretary's  guidelines on  what constitutes  overfishing, 50\n\nC.F.R. 602.11  (1991), the Council determined  that cod, haddock,\n\n                    \n\n2   Groundfish tend to live near the ocean floor and include cod,\nhaddock, and flounder. \n\n                               -6-\n\nand yellowtail flounder in certain fisheries off the coast of New\n\nEngland  were overfished  and drafted  amendment four  to redress\n\nthat problem.   The Secretary partially  approved amendment four,\n\n56 Fed. Reg.  24,724 (1991), but  found the amendment  deficient,\n\nstating  that  it  did  \"not  constitute  a  complete  rebuilding\n\nstrategy . . . .\"  Id. at 24,725. \n                      \n\n          In response  to amendment  four, Conservation sued  the\n\nSecretary, complaining that she  had arbitrarily and capriciously\n\napproved  the amendment and that the overall FMP failed to comply\n\nwith  National Standard  One.   Thereafter, Conservation  and the\n\nSecretary began  negotiations to enter a  consent decree settling\n\nthe  suit.  Appellants sought to intervene but the district court\n\ndenied the request.   While the appeal was pending,  the district\n\ncourt entered  a  consent decree  on  August 28,  1991.   In  the\n\nappeal, we granted appellants intervenor status.\n\n                        THE CONSENT DECREE\n                                          \n\n          The consent decree established a timetable for a FMP or\n\nan  amendment to the plan  applicable to New  England waters that\n\nwould \"eliminate  the overfished condition of  cod and yellowtail\n\nflounder  stocks in  five years  after implementation  and .  . .\n\neliminate the overfished condition of haddock stocks in ten years\n\nafter  implementation.\"   Conservation  Law  Foundation, Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\nMosbacher,  C.A.  No.  91-11759-MA,  slip  op.  at 2  (D.  Mass.,\n         \n\nAugust 28, 1991)  (consent decree).  The  decree expressly stated\n\nthat it  \"shall meet  all requirements established  by applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations  . . . .\"   Id. at 2.  It  directed that\n                                        \n\n                               -7-\n\nthe  New  England Council  would  have the  first  opportunity to\n\ndevelop the  groundfish rebuilding  plan, but also  established a\n\ntimetable  for the Secretary to create and implement her own plan\n\nif the council failed to act.  Appellants unsuccessfully moved to\n\nvacate the consent decree.  This appeal followed.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          District courts must review  a consent decree to ensure\n\nthat it  is \"fair,  adequate, and reasonable;  that the  proposed\n\ndecree  will not  violate the  Constitution, a  statute or  other\n\nauthority;  [and] that  it is consistent  with the  objectives of\n\nCongress . .  . .\"  Durrett  v.

Where  an administrative\n\nagency has  committed itself  to a  consent decree, the  district\n\ncourt must exercise some  deference to the agency's determination\n\nthat  settlement is  appropriate,  F.T.C.  v. Standard  Financial\n                                                                 \n\nManagement Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 408 (1st Cir. 1987), and \"refrain\n                \n\nfrom  second-guessing the  Executive Branch.\"   United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nCannons  Engineering Corp.,  899  F.2d 79,  84  (1st Cir.  1990).\n                          \n\nMoreover, \"the court is not barred from entering a consent decree\n\nmerely  because  it might  lack  authority  under [the  governing\n\nstatute] to do so after a  trial.\"  Local No. 93, Int'l  Ass'n of\n                                                                 \n\nFirefighters v.

Id.  Therefore, the parties\n                                         \n\nenjoy wide latitude in terms of what they may agree to by consent\n\ndecree and have sanctioned by a court.

They  assert that  the consent\n\ndecree  (1)  creates  a  new  standard  requiring  that  the  FMP\n\n\"eliminate\" overfishing, whereas  National Standard One  mandates\n\n\"prevention\" of overfishing while maintaining maximum sustainable\n\nyield from  fisheries; (2) requires  a rebuilding  program and  a\n\ntimetable for  compliance not  present in  the Magnuson Act;  (3)\n\nestablishes  a  \"good  faith\" performance  standard  for  Council\n\naction; and  (4) constrains the Secretary's  discretion under the\n\nAct.  \n\n          Appellants  essentially  maintain that  the Secretary's\n\n                               -9-\n\naction  with respect  to  Council-generated  FMPs, or  amendments\n\nthereto, must follow the statutorily prescribed course of review,\n\nas  set forth in  16 U.S.C.    1854(b),  which requires  that the\n\nSecretary notify the  council of its reasons for disapproving any\n\nportion of the plan and provide an opportunity for the council to\n\nrevise the plan.   Appellants also argue that the  consent decree\n\nessentially  is improper  under    1854(c), which  authorizes the\n\nSecretary to generate her  own plans under certain circumstances.\n\nAppellants maintain  that the  Secretary may  not act  unless the\n\nCouncil has failed  to issue a plan after a reasonable period, or\n\nthe  Secretary disapproves  of  some aspect  of  a plan  and  the\n\nCouncil  fails to revise it.  Because neither   1854(c) condition\n\nhas  occurred,  appellants   contend  that  the   consent  decree\n\nconstitutes unlawful rulemaking.   They allege that the Secretary\n\nis not free  to by-pass the dictates of    1854 through a consent\n\ndecree,  but  rather must  wait  for a  revised  amendment before\n\ndeveloping her own plan.\n\n          Appellants' challenge fails for three reasons.   First,\n\nin instances in  which the rights of third parties  are the basis\n\nfor blocking the entry  of, or vacating, a consent  decree, there\n\nmust  be a demonstrable injury  or adverse effect  upon the group\n\nnot party  to the decree.   See Durrett, 896  F.2d at 604.   This\n                                       \n\nthreshold  showing is analogous  to the standing  requirement.  A\n\nright  to intervene does not necessarily suffice to meet the test\n\nfor vacating a  consent decree.   In this  case, appellants  have\n\nfailed  to allege any specific injury to themselves, or any other\n\n                               -10-\n\nparty.  The  district court denied  appellants' motion to  vacate\n\nwithout  prejudice   to  renewal   for  precisely   this  reason.\n\nFurthermore, appellants' suggestion that they  have been excluded\n\nfrom  the development of the  plan is simply  untrue.  Appellants\n\nwill have ample opportunity to  comment on the plan  contemplated\n\nby  the consent decree through their influence in the New England\n\nCouncil,3  and through  the notice  and comment  process required\n\nbefore  final  rules  and  regulations  are  promulgated  by  the\n\nSecretary.\n\n          Second, the statutory argument based on   1854(c)(1)(B)\n\nis  without merit.   Section  1854(c)(1)(B) grants  the Secretary\n\nauthority  to  generate  her  own  plan,  after  disapproving  or\n\npartially disapproving a  council-generated plan, only  after the\n\ncouncil  fails  to  submit  a   revision.    Appellants  read    \n\n1854(c)(1)(B) as circumscribing the Secretary's authority in this\n\ncase,  because  Conservation  sued  alleging  the  illegality  of\n\namendment  four.   According  to appellants,  the consent  decree\n\nrepresents  an improper  exercise  by the  Secretary because  the\n\nCouncil has not  been given  a chance to  revise amendment  four.\n\nThus, until the  New England Council fails  to propose revisions,\n\nthe  Secretary may  not act.   If  we were to  follow appellants'\n\nsuggestion,  the  Secretary would  not  be able  to  exercise her\n\nstatutory  discretion to develop  her own  plan once  the Council\n\nsubmits a plan.  The practical effect would permit the Council to\n\n                    \n\n3   Apparently some members of the intervenor associations are on\nthe Council.\n\n                               -11-\n\ndetermine the timetable for developing and enforcing FMPs.  \n\n          The language of the  statute, however, does not support\n\nappellants' interpretation.  The statute authorizes the Secretary\n\nto develop her own plan if the council fails to submit a plan, or\n\namendment  thereto,  \"within  a  reasonable  time.\"    16  U.S.C.\n\n  1854(c)(1)(A).     Section  1854(c)(1)(B)  provides   that  the\n\nSecretary may  act if \"[he] disapproves  or partially disapproves\n\nany  such plan  or amendment,  or disapproves  a revised  plan or\n\namendment,  and the Council involved fails to submit a revised or\n\nfurther  revised plan or amendment, as the  case may be.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n  1854(c)(1)(B).   Thus, while  the provision does  not expressly\n\ninclude   the   phrase  \"after   a   reasonable   time,\"  as   in\n\n  1854(c)(1)(A),  such a condition is  implicit.  Without it, the\n\nstatute fails to indicate  who decides when a Council  has failed\n\nto act or how much time  must pass before that decision maker can\n\nconclude that  the council has  failed to  act.  Since  these two\n\nsubsections  are part of  the same statutory  grant of authority,\n\nand a  contrary reading would  create an incomprehensible  gap in\n\nthe  statute and hold the  Secretary hostage to  the Councils, we\n\nhold  that  the  Secretary  may generate  her  own  revisions  to\n\nCouncil-generated  plans, if the council fails  to revise after a\n\nreasonable time.  \n\n          Our reading  gives proper  deference to  the Secretary,\n\nwho,  under   the  Magnuson  Act,  is   ultimately  charged  with\n\npreventing overfishing as mandated by National Standard One.  The\n\ncouncils  serve the Secretary  by presenting FMPs.   The Magnuson\n\n                               -12-\n\nAct also unequivocally vests the Secretary with the discretion to\n\ndetermine  whether  a  Council's  progress  on  conservation  and\n\nmanagement is reasonable.\n\n          Furthermore,   contrary   to  appellants'   assertions,\n\nsection 1854(c)(1)(B) simply is not implicated in this case.  The\n\npurpose  of the consent decree was to avoid a legal determination\n\nwhether amendment  four complied  with National Standard  One, or\n\nwhether the Secretary had discharged her statutory duty under the\n\nMagnuson Act.  The decree sought to save limited agency resources\n\nthat  would   have  been   wasted  on  discovery,   compiling  an\n\nadministrative record,  and  protracted litigation.   The  decree\n\npurposefully  did  not  admit  wrong-doing  on  the  part of  the\n\nSecretary  or the improper approval of amendment four.  It merely\n\nmandates  the  creation  of  a  new  amendment, rather  than  the\n\nrevision  of an old one - amendment four.  As the provisions in  \n\n1854(c)(1)(B)  related  to  revisions  do not  apply  here,  that\n\nsection cannot be used as a shield to prevent  the Secretary from\n\nexercising her statutory discretion.\n\n          The third,  and final, reason the  appeal fails relates\n\nto the  permissible scope of  consent decrees.   Appellants argue\n\nthat  because the  suit  challenged amendment  four, the  consent\n\ndecree cannot resolve  matters beyond the terms of the amendment.\n\nThey  misstate the  factual  scope  of Conservation's  complaint.\n\nWhile it is true  that Conservation's original complaint attacked\n\nthe  Secretary's  approval  of  amendment four,  it  also  sought\n\nbroader relief - more vigorous conservation and management of New\n\n                               -13-\n\nEngland  fisheries.   In  any  event, the  law  governing consent\n\ndecrees  clearly holds  that parties  are not  restricted to  the\n\nterms of the complaint, and  may enter a consent decree on  other\n\nmatters,  provided they have the legal authority to do so.  Local\n                                                                 \n\nNo. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26.  \n      \n\n          In the present case, the Secretary simply has exercised\n\nher discretion  to set a timetable  for the development  of a FMP\n\nfor  New  England fisheries.    Specifically,  the Secretary  has\n\nstated  in advance that she will exercise her authority to create\n\na plan pursuant to   1854(c)(1)(A), unless the Council develops a\n\nFMP  within the  \"reasonable  time\" set  by  the consent  decree.\n\nIndeed,  it specifically  provides that  the New  England Council\n\nattempt to create a FMP before the Secretary acts.  \n\n          The Secretary  could have established the same schedule\n\nwithout explicitly notifying the  New England Council, or without\n\nentering a  consent decree, since what  constitutes a \"reasonable\n\ntime\"  under  the  statute   is  solely  within  the  Secretary's\n\ndiscretion.      Instead,   the   Secretary   chose   to   settle\n\nConservation's  law suit  with a  fair, adequate,  and reasonable\n\nconsent decree that agrees to  flexible dates for the development\n\nof a much needed FMP for New England.4   See Durrett, 896 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n604.  \n\n          In addition,  the district  court properly  entered the\n\n                    \n\n4  The parties to the consent decree  already have indicated that\nthe  specific dates  in the  decree will  be changed  because the\nCouncil  has failed to meet the deadline and both agree more time\nis necessary.\n\n                               -14-\n\nconsent decree under  the other factors of Local  No. 93.  First,\n                                                        \n\nthe  decree   resolved  a  dispute  within   the  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction  of   the  court  since  the   suit  challenged  the\n\nSecretary's approval  of  amendment four,  which  was  reviewable\n\npursuant to    1855(b).  Second, the parties agreed  to develop a\n\nfishery rebuilding program to prevent overfishing which remedy is\n\nwithin  the  general scope  of the  pleadings.   Indeed,  this is\n\nexactly the relief requested.  Third, it satisfies the objectives\n\nof the complaint.  Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26. \n                               \n\n          We  find  no  merit  to  appellants'  other  arguments.\n\nAppellants  rely heavily  on  the fact  that  the consent  decree\n\ncommits  the   Secretary  to   develop  a  plan   to  \"eliminate\"\n\noverfishing, rather  than \"prevent\" overfishing as  stated in the\n\nMagnuson  Act, 16 U.S.C.     1851(a).  This  change, they assert,\n\namounts  to  rulemaking  establishing a  new  standard.    On the\n\ncontrary, the decree  uses the word  \"eliminate\" because the  New\n\nEngland Council  already has determined that  overfishing of cod,\n\nhaddock, and  yellowtail flounder  presently occurs.   One cannot\n\nprevent what  has already  occurred.   Thus,  the consent  decree\n\nestablishes that a plan to rebuild will be developed in  order to\n\n\"eliminate\"   present   overfishing,    and   \"prevent\"    future\n\noverfishing.\n\n          Similarly, we  are  unmoved by  appellants'  contention\n\nthat the  consent decree imposes  a new \"good  faith\" requirement\n\nwith  respect  to Council  action, which  is  not present  in the\n\nMagnuson Act.  The \"good faith\" language of the consent decree is\n\n                               -15-\n\nsuperfluous and does not change the relationship between the  New\n\nEngland Council and the Secretary in any respect.  As the consent\n\ndecree  states,  the  Secretary  maintains   sole  discretion  to\n\ndetermine whether the  Council's failure to act requires that she\n\nbegin developing  her own conservation  program.   Substantively,\n\nthe  provisions of  the consent  decree mirror  those of    1854.\n\n\"The  fact  that  certain  provisions  in the  Decree  track  the\n\nlanguage  of the Act more  closely than others  is irrelevant, so\n\nlong as  all are  consistent  with it.\"   Citizens  for a  Better\n                                                                 \n\nEnvironment v.  Gorsuch, 718  F.2d  1117, 1125  (D.C. Cir.  1983)\n                       \n\n(holding  consent  decree  that  established   similar  timetable\n\njudicially enforceable).\n\n          With respect to the five and ten year rebuilding goals,\n\nthe Secretary  has discretion  to establish such  target periods.\n\nSection 1853(b)(10) provides that the Secretary may include \"such\n\nother measures,  requirements, or conditions and  restrictions as\n\nare  determined   to  be   necessary  and  appropriate   for  the\n\nconservation  and management  of  the fishery.\"   The  Secretary,\n\nthus, has broad discretion concerning the  contents of a FMP.  Of\n\ncourse,  the rebuilding  targets in  the consent  decree are  not\n\nrules, but rather periods  that may be incorporated into  a final\n\nrebuilding program contemplated by the consent decree.  \n\n          The decree  expressly provides that the  provisions for\n\nnotice and comment by the New England Council and the public will\n\nbe  followed.   Once  the Secretary  approves  a plan,  she  will\n\npromulgate  regulations to enforce the plan.  The consent decree,\n\n                               -16-\n\ntherefore, does  not violate the notice  and comment requirements\n\nof the statute because  it creates no rule  for which notice  and\n\ncomment  is required.    Appellants will  have an  opportunity to\n\nvoice their opinions on the plan.\n\n          Appellants'  last argument  contends that  the district\n\ncourt could not enter  the decree because it lacked  jurisdiction\n\nunder 16 U.S.C.   1855(b) of the Magnuson Act, which provides for\n\njudicial  review  only  of regulations  and  certain  secretarial\n\nactions.   The  claim  is  without  merit.    The  benchmark  for\n\ndetermining whether the court properly  exercised jurisdiction is\n\nthe  original complaint  filed  by Conservation.   The  complaint\n\nchallenged  amendment  four, among  other  things.   Because  the\n\ndistrict  court  had  jurisdiction  under     1855(b)  to  review\n\namendment four, the district court could enter the consent decree\n\nbecause it resolved the  dispute within the standards established\n\nby Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26.\n               \n\n          The district court's denial of the motion to vacate the\n\nconsent decree is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                               -17-\n",

To fully  understand  the present\n\nappeal, we  must briefly describe  the statutory context  to this\n\nsuit.\n\n                       STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n                                           \n\n          Congress  enacted  the  Magnuson  Act  to  establish  a\n\n                    \n\n1  These  associations include:   Associated Fisheries of  Maine,\nN.E.; Atlantic  Swordfish Net Ass'n, Inc.;  Massachusetts Inshore\nDraggermen's   Ass'n,   Inc.;   and   Point   Judith  Fishermen's\nCooperative Ass'n, Inc.\n\n                               -3-\n\ncomprehensive system  of fisheries  management for  waters within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the  United States.  16 U.S.C.    1801(b)(1).\n\nIn particular,  Congress found that  certain stocks  of fish  had\n\nbeen so overfished that  their survival was threatened, id.  at  \n                                                           \n\n1801(a)(2), and mandated that overfishing be prevented,  id. at  \n                                                            \n\n1851(a)(1). \n\n          To attain  these goals, the Act  creates eight regional\n\nfishery management councils.   Id.  at   1852(a).   The  regional\n                                  \n\ncouncils are comprised of state and federal government officials,\n\nas  well  as  individuals   nominated  by  state  executives  and\n\nappointed by the Secretary.  Id. at   1852(b), (c).  The Magnuson\n                                \n\nAct  charges  the  Secretary  and the  Councils  with  developing\n\nfishery management plans (\"FMPs\") for stocks of fish within their\n\njurisdictions that require conservation  and management.  The Act\n\nspecifies the  procedures by which FMPs are developed and creates\n\na number of standards to which  the plans must conform.  National\n\nStandard   One  requires  that   \"[c]onservation  and  management\n\nmeasures   shall  prevent  overfishing   while  achieving,  on  a\n\ncontinuing  basis, the  optimum yield from  each fishery  for the\n\nUnited  States  fishing industry.\"   Id.  at    1851(a)(1).   The\n                                        \n\nSecretary  has issued  guidelines  to assist  the development  of\n\nplans by the regional councils.  See 50 C.F.R. pt. 602. \n                                    \n\n          The  Act  provides  that  either the  councils  or  the\n\nSecretary  can develop FMPs.  If a  council generates a plan, the\n\nSecretary  must  follow  a  detailed  procedure  for  review,  as\n\nspecified in    1854(a), (b).   The Secretary  first reviews  the\n\n                               -4-\n\nplan for compliance with  statutory mandates and publishes notice\n\nof the  plan in  the Federal  Register, soliciting  comments from\n\ninterested  persons.   After review,  the Secretary  may approve,\n\npartially  approve, or  disapprove the  plan.   If  the Secretary\n\ndisapproves  or partially disapproves  of a plan  she must inform\n\nthe council of her reasons.  16 U.S.C.   1854(b)(2).  The council\n\nmay then  submit a revised plan,  id. at    1854(b)(3), which the\n                                     \n\nSecretary will review.\n\n          The Act authorizes the Secretary to develop an FMP with\n\nrespect to any fishery  if (1) \"the appropriate council  fails to\n\ndevelop and submit to the Secretary, after a reasonable period of\n                                                                 \n\ntime,  a  fishery  management  plan  for  such  fishery,  or  any\n    \n\nnecessary  amendment to  such a  plan, if  such  fishery requires\n\nconservation  and  management .  . .  ,\"  id. at    1854(c)(1)(A)\n                                             \n\n(emphasis added); or (2)  \"the Secretary disapproves or partially\n\ndisapproves any such plan or amendment,  or disapproves a revised\n\nplan or amendment,  and the  Council involved fails  to submit  a\n\nrevised or further  revised plan  or amendment, as  the case  may\n\nbe.\"   Id. at   1854(c)(1)(B).  Under either statutory authority,\n          \n\nthe  Secretary must submit the FMP to the appropriate council for\n\ncomments,  and publish  notice  of the  plan  and regulations  to\n\nimplement  the  plan  in   the  Federal  Register.    Id.   at   \n                                                         \n\n1854(c)(2)(A).   Before  the Secretary  implements the  plan, she\n\nmust consider the  comments of  the council and  the public,  and\n\nensure  compliance   with  the   national  standards.     Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n   1854(c)(2)(B), 1851, 1853.\n\n                               -5-\n\n          Approved   FMPs   are   implemented    by   regulations\n\npromulgated  by  the Secretary,  which  are  subject to  judicial\n\nreview in accordance with select provisions of the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C.   701 et seq.  See 16 U.S.C.   1855(b). \n                                           \n\n       HISTORY OF THE NORTHEAST MULTISPECIES FISHERIES PLAN\n                                                           \n\n          This case involves  the conservation and  management of\n\ngroundfish  off the  coast of  New England.2    In its  effort to\n\nmanage New England fisheries,  the New England Fishery Management\n\nCouncil (\"New England Council\")  first eliminated foreign fishing\n\nwithin its jurisdiction, 42 Fed. Reg. 13,998 (1977).  In 1985, it\n\ndeveloped the  Northeast  Multispecies Fisheries  Plan,  Proposed\n\nRule, 50 Fed. Reg. 49,582 (1985), because overfishing  remained a\n\nproblem.   The Secretary approved the plan  as an interim rule in\n\n1986,  indicating  that  the   rule  improved  matters,  but  was\n\nunsatisfactory  for   long  term  conservation   and  management.\n\nInterim Rule, 51  Fed. Reg. 29,642, 29,643 (1986).   In 1987, the\n\nrule became final and three amendments followed.  See Final Rule,\n                                                     \n\n52 Fed. Reg. 35,093  (1987) (amendment one); Final Rule,  54 Fed.\n\nReg.  4,798  (1989) (amendment  two);  Final Rule,  54  Fed. Reg.\n\n52,803 (1989) (amendment three).\n\n          The  Rule   and  its   amendments  did  not   eliminate\n\noverfishing as required  by National Standard  One.  Pursuant  to\n\nthe Secretary's  guidelines on  what constitutes  overfishing, 50\n\nC.F.R. 602.11  (1991), the Council determined  that cod, haddock,\n\n                    \n\n2   Groundfish tend to live near the ocean floor and include cod,\nhaddock, and flounder. \n\n                               -6-\n\nand yellowtail flounder in certain fisheries off the coast of New\n\nEngland  were overfished  and drafted  amendment four  to redress\n\nthat problem.   The Secretary partially  approved amendment four,\n\n56 Fed. Reg.  24,724 (1991), but  found the amendment  deficient,\n\nstating  that  it  did  \"not  constitute  a  complete  rebuilding\n\nstrategy . . . .\"  Id. at 24,725. \n                      \n\n          In response  to amendment  four, Conservation sued  the\n\nSecretary, complaining that she  had arbitrarily and capriciously\n\napproved  the amendment and that the overall FMP failed to comply\n\nwith  National Standard  One.   Thereafter, Conservation  and the\n\nSecretary began  negotiations to enter a  consent decree settling\n\nthe  suit.  Appellants sought to intervene but the district court\n\ndenied the request.   While the appeal was pending,  the district\n\ncourt entered  a  consent decree  on  August 28,  1991.   In  the\n\nappeal, we granted appellants intervenor status.\n\n                        THE CONSENT DECREE\n                                          \n\n          The consent decree established a timetable for a FMP or\n\nan  amendment to the plan  applicable to New  England waters that\n\nwould \"eliminate  the overfished condition of  cod and yellowtail\n\nflounder  stocks in  five years  after implementation  and .  . .\n\neliminate the overfished condition of haddock stocks in ten years\n\nafter  implementation.\"   Conservation  Law  Foundation, Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\nMosbacher,  C.A.

We\n                                                             \n\nturn now to appellants' challenge to the decree.\n\n          Appellants contend that  the consent decree constitutes\n\nimproper rulemaking  under the statute which  deprives the public\n\nof  an  opportunity to  comment.   They  assert that  the consent\n\ndecree  (1)  creates  a  new  standard  requiring  that  the  FMP\n\n\"eliminate\" overfishing, whereas  National Standard One  mandates\n\n\"prevention\" of overfishing while maintaining maximum sustainable\n\nyield from  fisheries; (2) requires  a rebuilding  program and  a\n\ntimetable for  compliance not  present in  the Magnuson Act;  (3)\n\nestablishes  a  \"good  faith\" performance  standard  for  Council\n\naction; and  (4) constrains the Secretary's  discretion under the\n\nAct.  \n\n          Appellants  essentially  maintain that  the Secretary's\n\n                               -9-\n\naction  with respect  to  Council-generated  FMPs, or  amendments\n\nthereto, must follow the statutorily prescribed course of review,\n\nas  set forth in  16 U.S.C.    1854(b),  which requires  that the\n\nSecretary notify the  council of its reasons for disapproving any\n\nportion of the plan and provide an opportunity for the council to\n\nrevise the plan.   Appellants also argue that the  consent decree\n\nessentially  is improper  under    1854(c), which  authorizes the\n\nSecretary to generate her  own plans under certain circumstances.\n\nAppellants maintain  that the  Secretary may  not act  unless the\n\nCouncil has failed  to issue a plan after a reasonable period, or\n\nthe  Secretary disapproves  of  some aspect  of  a plan  and  the\n\nCouncil  fails to revise it.  Because neither   1854(c) condition\n\nhas  occurred,  appellants   contend  that  the   consent  decree\n\nconstitutes unlawful rulemaking.   They allege that the Secretary\n\nis not free  to by-pass the dictates of    1854 through a consent\n\ndecree,  but  rather must  wait  for a  revised  amendment before\n\ndeveloping her own plan.\n\n          Appellants' challenge fails for three reasons.   First,\n\nin instances in  which the rights of third parties  are the basis\n\nfor blocking the entry  of, or vacating, a consent  decree, there\n\nmust  be a demonstrable injury  or adverse effect  upon the group\n\nnot party  to the decree.   See Durrett, 896  F.2d at 604.   This\n                                       \n\nthreshold  showing is analogous  to the standing  requirement.  A\n\nright  to intervene does not necessarily suffice to meet the test\n\nfor vacating a  consent decree.   In this  case, appellants  have\n\nfailed  to allege any specific injury to themselves, or any other\n\n                               -10-\n\nparty.  The  district court denied  appellants' motion to  vacate\n\nwithout  prejudice   to  renewal   for  precisely   this  reason.\n\nFurthermore, appellants' suggestion that they  have been excluded\n\nfrom  the development of the  plan is simply  untrue.  Appellants\n\nwill have ample opportunity to  comment on the plan  contemplated\n\nby  the consent decree through their influence in the New England\n\nCouncil,3  and through  the notice  and comment  process required\n\nbefore  final  rules  and  regulations  are  promulgated  by  the\n\nSecretary.\n\n          Second, the statutory argument based on   1854(c)(1)(B)\n\nis  without merit.   Section  1854(c)(1)(B) grants  the Secretary\n\nauthority  to  generate  her  own  plan,  after  disapproving  or\n\npartially disapproving a  council-generated plan, only  after the\n\ncouncil  fails  to  submit  a   revision.    Appellants  read    \n\n1854(c)(1)(B) as circumscribing the Secretary's authority in this\n\ncase,  because  Conservation  sued  alleging  the  illegality  of\n\namendment  four.   According  to appellants,  the consent  decree\n\nrepresents  an improper  exercise  by the  Secretary because  the\n\nCouncil has not  been given  a chance to  revise amendment  four.\n\nThus, until the  New England Council fails  to propose revisions,\n\nthe  Secretary may  not act.   If  we were to  follow appellants'\n\nsuggestion,  the  Secretary would  not  be able  to  exercise her\n\nstatutory  discretion to develop  her own  plan once  the Council\n\nsubmits a plan.  The practical effect would permit the Council to\n\n                    \n\n3   Apparently some members of the intervenor associations are on\nthe Council.\n\n                               -11-\n\ndetermine the timetable for developing and enforcing FMPs.  \n\n          The language of the  statute, however, does not support\n\nappellants' interpretation.  The statute authorizes the Secretary\n\nto develop her own plan if the council fails to submit a plan, or\n\namendment  thereto,  \"within  a  reasonable  time.\"    16  U.S.C.\n\n  1854(c)(1)(A).     Section  1854(c)(1)(B)  provides   that  the\n\nSecretary may  act if \"[he] disapproves  or partially disapproves\n\nany  such plan  or amendment,  or disapproves  a revised  plan or\n\namendment,  and the Council involved fails to submit a revised or\n\nfurther  revised plan or amendment, as the  case may be.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n  1854(c)(1)(B).   Thus, while  the provision does  not expressly\n\ninclude   the   phrase  \"after   a   reasonable   time,\"  as   in\n\n  1854(c)(1)(A),  such a condition is  implicit.  Without it, the\n\nstatute fails to indicate  who decides when a Council  has failed\n\nto act or how much time  must pass before that decision maker can\n\nconclude that  the council has  failed to  act.  Since  these two\n\nsubsections  are part of  the same statutory  grant of authority,\n\nand a  contrary reading would  create an incomprehensible  gap in\n\nthe  statute and hold the  Secretary hostage to  the Councils, we\n\nhold  that  the  Secretary  may generate  her  own  revisions  to\n\nCouncil-generated  plans, if the council fails  to revise after a\n\nreasonable time.  \n\n          Our reading  gives proper  deference to  the Secretary,\n\nwho,  under   the  Magnuson  Act,  is   ultimately  charged  with\n\npreventing overfishing as mandated by National Standard One.  The\n\ncouncils  serve the Secretary  by presenting FMPs.   The Magnuson\n\n                               -12-\n\nAct also unequivocally vests the Secretary with the discretion to\n\ndetermine  whether  a  Council's  progress  on  conservation  and\n\nmanagement is reasonable.\n\n          Furthermore,   contrary   to  appellants'   assertions,\n\nsection 1854(c)(1)(B) simply is not implicated in this case.  The\n\npurpose  of the consent decree was to avoid a legal determination\n\nwhether amendment  four complied  with National Standard  One, or\n\nwhether the Secretary had discharged her statutory duty under the\n\nMagnuson Act.  The decree sought to save limited agency resources\n\nthat  would   have  been   wasted  on  discovery,   compiling  an\n\nadministrative record,  and  protracted litigation.   The  decree\n\npurposefully  did  not  admit  wrong-doing  on  the  part of  the\n\nSecretary  or the improper approval of amendment four.  It merely\n\nmandates  the  creation  of  a  new  amendment, rather  than  the\n\nrevision  of an old one - amendment four.  As the provisions in  \n\n1854(c)(1)(B)  related  to  revisions  do not  apply  here,  that\n\nsection cannot be used as a shield to prevent  the Secretary from\n\nexercising her statutory discretion.\n\n          The third,  and final, reason the  appeal fails relates\n\nto the  permissible scope of  consent decrees.   Appellants argue\n\nthat  because the  suit  challenged amendment  four, the  consent\n\ndecree cannot resolve  matters beyond the terms of the amendment.\n\nThey  misstate the  factual  scope  of Conservation's  complaint.\n\nWhile it is true  that Conservation's original complaint attacked\n\nthe  Secretary's  approval  of  amendment four,  it  also  sought\n\nbroader relief - more vigorous conservation and management of New\n\n                               -13-\n\nEngland  fisheries.   In  any  event, the  law  governing consent\n\ndecrees  clearly holds  that parties  are not  restricted to  the\n\nterms of the complaint, and  may enter a consent decree on  other\n\nmatters,  provided they have the legal authority to do so.  Local\n                                                                 \n\nNo. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26.  \n      \n\n          In the present case, the Secretary simply has exercised\n\nher discretion  to set a timetable  for the development  of a FMP\n\nfor  New  England fisheries.    Specifically,  the Secretary  has\n\nstated  in advance that she will exercise her authority to create\n\na plan pursuant to   1854(c)(1)(A), unless the Council develops a\n\nFMP  within the  \"reasonable  time\" set  by  the consent  decree.\n\nIndeed,  it specifically  provides that  the New  England Council\n\nattempt to create a FMP before the Secretary acts.  \n\n          The Secretary  could have established the same schedule\n\nwithout explicitly notifying the  New England Council, or without\n\nentering a  consent decree, since what  constitutes a \"reasonable\n\ntime\"  under  the  statute   is  solely  within  the  Secretary's\n\ndiscretion.      Instead,   the   Secretary   chose   to   settle\n\nConservation's  law suit  with a  fair, adequate,  and reasonable\n\nconsent decree that agrees to  flexible dates for the development\n\nof a much needed FMP for New England.4   See Durrett, 896 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n604.  \n\n          In addition,  the district  court properly  entered the\n\n                    \n\n4  The parties to the consent decree  already have indicated that\nthe  specific dates  in the  decree will  be changed  because the\nCouncil  has failed to meet the deadline and both agree more time\nis necessary.\n\n                               -14-\n\nconsent decree under  the other factors of Local  No. 93.  First,\n                                                        \n\nthe  decree   resolved  a  dispute  within   the  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction  of   the  court  since  the   suit  challenged  the\n\nSecretary's approval  of  amendment four,  which  was  reviewable\n\npursuant to    1855(b).  Second, the parties agreed  to develop a\n\nfishery rebuilding program to prevent overfishing which remedy is\n\nwithin  the  general scope  of the  pleadings.   Indeed,  this is\n\nexactly the relief requested.  Third, it satisfies the objectives\n\nof the complaint.  Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26. \n                               \n\n          We  find  no  merit  to  appellants'  other  arguments.\n\nAppellants  rely heavily  on  the fact  that  the consent  decree\n\ncommits  the   Secretary  to   develop  a  plan   to  \"eliminate\"\n\noverfishing, rather  than \"prevent\" overfishing as  stated in the\n\nMagnuson  Act, 16 U.S.C.     1851(a).  This  change, they assert,\n\namounts  to  rulemaking  establishing a  new  standard.    On the\n\ncontrary, the decree  uses the word  \"eliminate\" because the  New\n\nEngland Council  already has determined that  overfishing of cod,\n\nhaddock, and  yellowtail flounder  presently occurs.   One cannot\n\nprevent what  has already  occurred.   Thus,  the consent  decree\n\nestablishes that a plan to rebuild will be developed in  order to\n\n\"eliminate\"   present   overfishing,    and   \"prevent\"    future\n\noverfishing.\n\n          Similarly, we  are  unmoved by  appellants'  contention\n\nthat the  consent decree imposes  a new \"good  faith\" requirement\n\nwith  respect  to Council  action, which  is  not present  in the\n\nMagnuson Act.  The \"good faith\" language of the consent decree is\n\n                               -15-\n\nsuperfluous and does not change the relationship between the  New\n\nEngland Council and the Secretary in any respect.  As the consent\n\ndecree  states,  the  Secretary  maintains   sole  discretion  to\n\ndetermine whether the  Council's failure to act requires that she\n\nbegin developing  her own conservation  program.   Substantively,\n\nthe  provisions of  the consent  decree mirror  those of    1854.\n\n\"The  fact  that  certain  provisions  in the  Decree  track  the\n\nlanguage  of the Act more  closely than others  is irrelevant, so\n\nlong as  all are  consistent  with it.\"   Citizens  for a  Better\n                                                                 \n\nEnvironment v.  Gorsuch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"425934\"><a href=\"/opinion/425934/citizens-for-a-better-environment-dennis-l-adamczyk-v-anne-gorsuch/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1125  (D.C. Cir.  1983)\n                       \n\n(holding  consent  decree  that  established   similar  timetable\n\njudicially enforceable).\n\n          With respect to the five and ten year rebuilding goals,\n\nthe Secretary  has discretion  to establish such  target periods.\n\nSection 1853(b)(10) provides that the Secretary may include \"such\n\nother measures,  requirements, or conditions and  restrictions as\n\nare  determined   to  be   necessary  and  appropriate   for  the\n\nconservation  and management  of  the fishery.\"   The  Secretary,\n\nthus, has broad discretion concerning the  contents of a FMP.  Of\n\ncourse,  the rebuilding  targets in  the consent  decree are  not\n\nrules, but rather periods  that may be incorporated into  a final\n\nrebuilding program contemplated by the consent decree.  \n\n          The decree  expressly provides that the  provisions for\n\nnotice and comment by the New England Council and the public will\n\nbe  followed.   Once  the Secretary  approves  a plan,  she  will\n\npromulgate  regulations to enforce the plan.  The consent decree,\n\n                               -16-\n\ntherefore, does  not violate the notice  and comment requirements\n\nof the statute because  it creates no rule  for which notice  and\n\ncomment  is required.    Appellants will  have an  opportunity to\n\nvoice their opinions on the plan.\n\n          Appellants'  last argument  contends that  the district\n\ncourt could not enter  the decree because it lacked  jurisdiction\n\nunder 16 U.S.C.   1855(b) of the Magnuson Act, which provides for\n\njudicial  review  only  of regulations  and  certain  secretarial\n\nactions.   The  claim  is  without  merit.    The  benchmark  for\n\ndetermining whether the court properly  exercised jurisdiction is\n\nthe  original complaint  filed  by Conservation.   The  complaint\n\nchallenged  amendment  four, among  other  things.   Because  the\n\ndistrict  court  had  jurisdiction  under     1855(b)  to  review\n\namendment four, the district court could enter the consent decree\n\nbecause it resolved the  dispute within the standards established\n\nby Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 525-26.\n               \n\n          The district court's denial of the motion to vacate the\n\nconsent decree is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                               -17-\n</pre>",
