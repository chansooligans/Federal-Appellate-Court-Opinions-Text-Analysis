This case started as  a dispute\n                          \n\nbetween John Talley (\"Talley\"),  co-executor of the estate of\n\nPercy Talley, and the United States over the tax liability of\n\nthe  estate.  The tax issues have become snarled in confusion\n\nwrought  by  a  cryptic  notice  from  the  Internal  Revenue\n\nService,  a loosely worded request to  admit filed by Talley,\n\nand  a set  of litigation  errors by  the government.   After\n\ntrial, the district court entered judgment for  Talley on his\n\ntax refund  claim and  disallowed the government's  effort to\n\nassert a counterclaim.   We  reverse the  district court  and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n                         I. THE FACTS\n\n     In October  1984, Talley, acting as  co-executor for the\n\nestate, entered into a stipulation with the IRS regarding the\n\namount  of taxes owed by the estate.  This stipulation, filed\n\nin the  Tax  Court,  provided that  the  estate's  total  tax\n\nliability was $345,103.21.  Of this, $222,000  had been paid,\n\nleaving   an  outstanding  liability  of  $125,103.21.    The\n\nstipulation also provided that  the estate could submit proof\n\nthat it  had paid  certain state taxes,  which would  further\n\nreduce its outstanding liability.  The stipulation also noted\n\nthat of  the $345,103.21 tax liability,  $288,836.97 had been\n\n\"assessed\"and $56,266.24was a\"[d]eficiency (tobe assessed).\"2\n\n                    \n\n     2Assessment  is  the  formal   step  in  which  the  IRS\ndetermines that a specific amount of tax is currently due and\nowing  to  the  government  from  the  taxpayer,  making  the\n\n                             -2-\n\n     In  November  1984, the  IRS  sent the  estate  a notice\n\nwhich, as it  is the  cause of half  the confusion,  requires\n\ndescription.   Under  the heading  \"Statement of  Tax Due  On\n\nFederal  Tax Return,\"  it showed  as the  first entry  in the\n\n\"Assessment\" column the figure $56,266.24,  designated \"tax\";\n\nunder  this  was  the  figure  $1,478.80,  designated  \"int,\"\n\npresumably interest.   The  second column, under  the heading\n\n\"Adjustment  or  Credit,\"  contained  the  figure $57,767.39,\n\napparently  designed  to  reflect credits  against  liability\n\nallowed  by the  IRS.   Finally,  in  a third  column  headed\n\n\"Balance  Due\"  there  appeared  the  figure  $977.65,  which\n\nreflected the difference between the first column figures and\n\nthe second column figure.   In January 1985, the  estate paid\n\nthis net amount, $977.65.  \n\n     Six months later, in May 1985, the IRS sent the estate a\n\n\"Statement  of  Adjustment  to  Your Account,\"    fixing  the\n\nestate's outstanding  tax liability at $294,046.   The stated\n\nliability,  much above the net amount due under the Tax Court\n\nstipulation, appears  to include  penalties and interest  not\n\npreviously  assessed.  In  any event, the  estate declined to\n\npay.   In response, the  IRS began to  levy on bank  accounts\n\nheld  by  the   estate  and   its  distributees,   ultimately\n\ncollecting approximately $94,000.  In the  government's view,\n\n                    \n\ntaxpayer liable for that amount.  Rambo v. United States, 492\n                                                        \nF.2d 1060, 1061 n.1  (6th Cir. 1974), cert. denied,  423 U.S.\n                                                  \n1091 (1976).\n\n                             -3-\n\nit was still owed at least $200,000, with interest continuing\n\nto  accrue.  Talley, by  contrast, took the  position that no\n\ntaxes were owing and that the levies were therefore unlawful.\n\n     After  exhausting administrative remedies, the estate in\n\nJanuary 1989 filed a complaint  in the district court seeking\n\na  refund  of  the  approximately  $94,000.    The  complaint\n\ncontended  that the  estate's outstanding  tax liability  had\n\nbeen  wholly  eliminated  prior  to  the  levies.    Talley's\n\ncomplaint averred  that this happy situation  resulted from a\n\ncombination  of state  tax  credits, allegedly  amounting  to\n\n$77,544, and  the November  1984 notice, which  (according to\n\nthe complaint) \"zeroed out\"  any remaining obligations of the\n\nestate to  the IRS.   The  concept of \"zeroing  out\" was  not\n\nexplained in the complaint, nor  has it been explained since.\n\n     Although the government believed  that it was still owed\n\n$200,000 or more by the estate, it neglected in answering the\n\ncomplaint to file a timely counterclaim for the balance.  See\n                                                             \n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 13.   It then  failed to respond  at all  to\n\nTalley's request  for admissions served on  the government on\n\nOctober  11, 1989, pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 36.  Request\n\nno. 12 asked the  government to admit that the  estate's $977\n\ndisbursement   in  response  to   the  November  1984  notice\n\n\"constituted full payment of the balance due on the estate of\n\nPercy Talley  as set forth  in that  notice.\"  Under  Fed. R.\n\n                             -4-\n\nCiv. P. 36(a), the failure to respond to a such  a request is\n\ndeemed  a binding  admission, unless  the court  later grants\n\nleave under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) to withdraw the admission.\n\n     New  government counsel  took  over the  case in  spring\n\n1990,  and the case was set for trial  in July 1990.  In June\n\n1990  the government  sought  leave to  amend its  answer and\n\nassert  a counterclaim.    The government's  excuse for  this\n\nbelated action was that  at the time of the  original answer,\n\ncounsel had  lacked the Secretary of  the Treasury's approval\n\nto  assert a  counterclaim.   That motion  was denied  by the\n\ndistrict  court on June 19, 1990, even though in the meantime\n\nthe court  had (for other  reasons) deferred the  trial until\n\nOctober  1990.  The court's reasons for refusing to allow the\n\ncounterclaim are discussed more fully below.\n\n     Government counsel also  advised the  district court  in\n\nJune 1990 that  the government would  promptly file a  motion\n\nseeking leave to withdraw its admission by default to request\n\nno.  12.   The government  never filed  such a  motion, later\n\ntaking the view (in  a pretrial statement filed  on September\n\n10,  1990)  that the  admission  was  literally accurate  and\n\nharmless to the government's  position.  The government's new\n\ninterpretation  was that  it had  properly admitted  that the\n\n$977  payment  constituted  full  payment  of   the  estate's\n\nliability  \"as set forth in\" the notice; but since the notice\n\nwas  inaccurate, this  admission (the government  argued) did\n\n                             -5-\n\nnot  establish  that the  payment  discharged  the taxpayer's\n\nactual liability.\n\n     A trial  was held before  the district court  on October\n\n12,  1990.  At trial, Talley based his refund claim primarily\n\nupon  the government's  admission to  request no.  12.   Over\n\nTalley's  objection, the  court permitted  the government  to\n\nintroduce evidence of Talley's tax liability according to the\n\ngovernment's  calculations.    But  the  court  accepted  the\n\nevidence subject  to the court's reserved  ruling on Talley's\n\nclaim  that  the government's  admission  of  request no.  12\n\nbarred the evidence and resolved the case.  The court stated:\n\n          Just so we are  clear, I'm allowing  [the\n          government]  to   present  this  evidence\n          because I  do not know what  I'm going to\n          do and  I wouldn't  like to have  to come\n          back  and get  some more  hearing or  get\n          some  more testimony.  . . [i]f  I decide\n          that you are stuck with  your admission .\n          .  .,   it  would   mean  you  would   be\n          precluded.\n\nThe government also moved to  amend its pleadings to  conform\n\nto the evidence introduced.\n\n     After  trial,  the  district court  issued  a memorandum\n\nopinion in which it  rejected the government's interpretation\n\nof request no. 12, and concluded that the request referred to\n\nthe  estate's  actual liability.    The court  held  that the\n\nadmission conclusively  established  that the  estate's  $977\n\npayment  satisfied its  total  tax liability,  and the  court\n\ntherefore entered  judgment in  favor of  the estate for  the\n\n                             -6-\n\napproximately $94,000 seized from the estate's bank accounts.\n\nThe government  then  appealed, arguing  that  its  admission\n\npursuant to  request no.  12 had  been wrongly  construed and\n\nthat its counterclaim should have been allowed.\n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Talley  has not  claimed in  this court  any prejudicial\n\nreliance on the original  November 1984 notice.  It  would be\n\ndifficult  as a factual matter  to make any  such claim since\n\nabout  six months later the IRS asserted that the estate owed\n\nover  $294,000,  and  there  is  no indication  that  in  the\n\nmeantime  any  detrimental reliance  had  occurred.   Indeed,\n\nauthorities do  not give  much comfort to  taxpayers invoking\n\nestoppel even when there has been reliance.  On the contrary,\n\nthe  government has  even  prosecuted  taxpayers for  cashing\n\nrefund checks issued in  error.  See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nMcRee, 984 F.2d 1144 (11th Cir. 1993).\n     \n\n     Talley's position  on appeal, however,  does not  depend\n\ndirectly on  the original  notice or upon  estoppel doctrine.\n\nRather,  it is based upon request no. 12 which the government\n\n\"admitted\" by failing to answer.  The district court read the\n\nrequest, as  admitted, to  establish that the  estate's total\n\ntax  liability  in  November  1984  was  only  $977.66.    An\n\nadmission under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a) is, by the terms of the\n\nrule, binding on the party making the admission and cannot be\n\ncontradicted.  Thus, if the district court properly construed\n\n                             -7-\n\nrequest no. 12,  the government  was bound  by its  admission\n\n(unless  the  court  sua  sponte should  have  permitted  the\n                                \n\ngovernment to withdraw the admission).\n\n     Although the question  is a close  one, we believe  that\n\nboth  the November 1984 notice  and request no.  12 have been\n\nmisconstrued.  The construction of documents presents, in the\n\nabsence of contested  background facts, a  pure issue of  law\n\nopen to  de novo review.  See Trust Under the Will of Bingham\n                                                             \n\nv. Commissioner, 325 U.S.  365, 379-80 (1945).  The  district\n               \n\ncourt's  effort  at  construction  was  complicated  by   the\n\ngovernment's  own  changes   in  position  and   its  failure\n\nadequately to place the  documents in context.  Nevertheless,\n\nwe conclude that  the original November  1984 notice did  not\n\nstate that  the estate's total  tax liability was  only $977,\n\nand the admission by default to  request no. 12 did not do so\n\neither.\n\n     The  November 1984 notice  is, of course,  an opaque and\n\npotentially misleading  document, but  in  these respects  it\n\ndoes not differ from many IRS notices apparently generated by\n\ncomputers.  No doubt  taken in isolation the notice  could be\n\nmisunderstood by a lay reader to suggest that the estate owed\n\nonly $977;  but it cannot be  taken in isolation and  that is\n\nnot what it says.  Juxtaposed with the Tax Court stipulation,\n\nit is  clear that the  November 1984  notice merely  reflects\n\nthree separate tax events: the original additional deficiency\n\n                             -8-\n\nassessment promised by  the stipulation ($56,266.24), plus  a\n\nsmall amount  of  accrued interest  ($1,478),  minus  credits\n\n($57,767.39)  allowed  by  the  IRS to  reduce  the  estate's\n\noutstanding liability.\n\n     The  net  effect  of  these  three  adjustments  was  to\n\nincrease   the  estate's   assessed   liability  by   $977.65\n\n($56,266.24  + $1,478 - $57,767.39).  That figure was, as the\n\nnotice said, a \"Balance  Due\" but only as  the net result  of\n\nthe  three  adjustments.   The notice  did  not say  that the\n\nbalance-due figure captured the estate's total tax liability.\n\nOne  who looked only at the notice might think otherwise, but\n\nany  lawyer  or  estate  executor  who  looked  also  at  the\n\nstipulation would  understand how these figures  fit together\n\nand recognize the limited role of the notice.  Indeed, only a\n\nmonth before  the estate had  stipulated to  a vastly  larger\n\ndebt of  $123,103.21  ($66,836.97 assessed  but  unpaid  plus\n\n$56,266.24 not yet assessed  but conceded) and had apparently\n\nmade no payments since then.3\n\n     This brings us to  request no. 12.  This request was the\n\nlast one in Talley's first  set of requests to admit, and  it\n\nfollowed 11  individual paragraphs  that asked only  that the\n\n                    \n\n     3In  other words, as of October 29, 1984, the estate had\nagreed that it  owed $123,103.21.   The IRS  notice the  next\nmonth allowed  a credit  of only $57,767.39,  so--quite apart\nfrom any  accrued interest  or penalties--Talley  should have\nknown that over $65,000 remained unpaid as of the date of the\nnotice.\n\n                             -9-\n\ngovernment admit that the  listed documents (in the  first 11\n\nrequest paragraphs) were \"true copies\" of what they purported\n\nto be.  No. 12 was worded somewhat differently:\n\n     Request No. 12\n                   \n\n          12.    Admit  that  the  payment  of  Nine  Hundred\n     Seventy-seven  ($977.65)  Dollars  and  65/100  by  John\n     Talley concerning  the Notice of Tax  Due dated November\n     29, 1984  (Exhibit 1),  constituted full payment  of the\n     balance due on the  estate of Percy Talley as  set forth\n     in that notice.\n\n     This last  request, whether  deliberately or not,  is an\n\ninvitation to confusion.   First, it misstates by implication\n\nthe  gist of  the  notice, leaving  the impression  (with the\n\nwords  \"full  payment\")  that  total tax  liability  was  the\n\nsubject of the notice when in fact the notice did not reflect\n\nthe total balance  due from  the estate.   Second, by  ending\n\nwith  the phrase \"as set  forth in that  notice,\" the request\n\nallows one  reader to  think that an  admission would  merely\n\nconcede  that the  estate had  in fact  paid the  amount \"set\n\nforth  in the  notice\" and  another reader  to think  that it\n\nwould concede  that the notice correctly  stated the estate's\n\ntax liability.\n\n     Of course, neither  reading makes much sense.  The first\n\nreading  of the request asks  the government to  admit a fact\n\nthat no one would dispute; the second,  to admit a point that\n\nthe government could not  ever intentionally concede, since--\n\napart  from inaccuracy--it would  give away the  lawsuit.  If\n\nthe government  had bothered to read  the request, presumably\n\n                             -10-\n\nit  would have said in  response that the  payment of $977.65\n\ndid constitute  \"full payment\"  of the amount  stated in  the\n\nnotice but  that the amount stated  at the end of  the notice\n\ndid  not reflect--or  even purport  to reflect--the  full tax\n\nliability of  the estate.   Instead,  the government  let the\n\nrequest go unanswered.4\n\n     In all  events,  we  think that  request  no.  12,  read\n\nagainst the  background of  the October 1984  stipulation and\n\nthe  November 1984 notice, cannot fairly be read as a request\n\nby Talley that the government admit  that the $977.65 payment\n\nsatisfied the actual total  liability of the estate.   To the\n\nextent that the request is ambiguous, that ambiguity is to be\n\nconstrued against Talley (whose  lawyer drafted the request).\n\nSee  Dixon v.  Commissioner,  62 T.C.M.  (C.C.H.) 1440,  1511\n                           \n\n(1991).   And to the extent  that common sense is  a guide to\n\nconstruction,  a  reading  that  trivializes  the request  is\n\npreferred  to one that renders the request absurd.  In short,\n\ntreating the  government as  bound by  its  admission of  the\n\nrequest,  we believe it has  admitted only what  it has never\n\ndenied: that  the $977.65 payment corresponded  to the amount\n\nset forth in the notice.\n\n                    \n\n     4When it got around to reading the request in June 1989,\nthe government then compounded the confusion by first reading\nthe request  as Talley  now urges  (and telling  the district\ncourt  that it would move to withdraw the admission) and then\nreading the request merely to admit that the amount stated in\nthe request  had  been  paid  (making  a  withdrawal  of  the\nadmission unnecessary).\n\n                             -11-\n\n     Since  in  our  view  the  district  court  misconstrued\n\nrequest  no. 12, its judgment in favor of Talley--which rests\n\nsolely  on the  government's  admission of  request no.  12--\n\ncannot stand.   The scope of  the remand is addressed  at the\n\nconclusion of this opinion.  We do not reach the government's\n\nalternative  argument  that,  if  the request  were  read  in\n\nTalley's  favor,   then  the  government  should   have  been\n\npermitted to withdraw its admission.  Such an argument itself\n\nraises  troublesome  questions  that  we  readily  leave  for\n\nanother day.5\n\n     The  other issue  presented  by the  government on  this\n\nappeal is whether the district court erred when it refused to\n\npermit the  government belatedly to file a  counterclaim.  It\n\nwill be recalled  that Talley sued the  government to recover\n\nthe levies against the estate bank account amounting to about\n\n$94,000.   From  the  government's standpoint,  not only  did\n\nTalley have no right to a refund but, in addition, the estate\n\nstill  owed the  government for  unpaid taxes,  penalties and\n\ninterest, which the levies had only  partially recovered.  It\n\nis undisputed that the government's claim for any balance due\n\n                    \n\n     5For example, whether Talley's reliance on the admission\nwas unreasonable; whether Talley would suffer any \"prejudice\"\nfrom a belated withdrawal in the technical sense specified by\nRule 36(b);  and whether  the government's motion  to conform\nthe  pleadings  to the  evidence  could  be  construed as  an\nimplied, conditional request to withdraw the admission.\n\n                             -12-\n\nis a compulsory counterclaim  which, if not properly asserted\n\nin this case, is lost forever.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a).\n\n     Under the rules, the government should have asserted its\n\ncounterclaim when answering Talley's complaint.  Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  13(a).  Instead, it waited for over  a year and a half to\n\ndo so, explaining that  it had not asserted the claim  in its\n\nanswer because it needed to await approval from the Secretary\n\nof the  Treasury.  At the time its motion to amend the answer\n\nwas  filed in  June 1990,  the case  was then  on the  eve of\n\ntrial.  The trial date was then postponed for several months,\n\nfrom  June to October,  when the government  proposed to call\n\nTalley's  counsel  as  a  witness,  but  the  district  court\n\nnevertheless ruled after the postponement that the motion for\n\nleave to file the counterclaim came too late.\n\n     \"It is incomprehensible,\" said the district court, \"that\n\nit took the government well over one year to obtain authority\n\nfrom the Secretary of  the Treasury . . . .\"   The court also\n\nsaid  that  allowing the  counterclaim  at  this point  would\n\nexpose Talley \"to significant prejudice at  this stage of the\n\nproceeding,\" as well as  \"to substantial inconvenience.\"  The\n\ndistrict court did not  explain the basis for any  finding of\n\neither  prejudice  or  inconvenience.    Talley's  memorandum\n\nopposing the  motion to  assert the  counterclaim did  make a\n\nclaim of prejudice; in  somewhat veiled fashion, it suggested\n\nthat,   if  the  estate  had   been  timely  advised  of  the\n\n                             -13-\n\ncounterclaim, it  would have summoned witnesses  to show that\n\noral  statements  of  an  IRS  representative  in  July  1988\n\nconceded  \"that no  liability  remained with  regard to  this\n\nestate.\" \n\n     How this issue--the district court's refusal to permit a\n\nbelated counterclaim--should be resolved in the ordinary case\n\nis  open to debate.   On the  one hand, the  government's 18-\n\nmonth delay in advancing  its counterclaim is substantial and\n\nits excuse lame; perhaps  the Secretary had not approved  the\n\ncounterclaim when the answer was due but that did not require\n\nthe government to  wait for 18 months, until  after discovery\n\nwas completed, to assert a counterclaim that was evident from\n\nthe outset.   Trial judges, who  have considerable discretion\n\nin such  matters, are  understandably loath to  entertain new\n\nclaims  in  June  when  trial  is  scheduled  for July,  when\n\ndiscovery  has been  completed, and  when the  government has\n\nlittle excuse for so long a delay in asserting its claim.\n\n     The government,  on the  other  hand, reasonably  argues\n\nthat its counterclaim motion was not resolved until after the\n\ntrial  had   been   postponed  until   October,   alleviating\n\ninconvenience.   More important, virtually the  same evidence\n\nthe government would be expected to offer to refute  Talley's\n\nrefund  claim would,  if the  government's proof  were valid,\n\nalso  establish  its  own  right  to  affirmative   recovery.\n\nFinally, the only \"prejudice\"  from a withdrawal described by\n\n                             -14-\n\nTalley is not very persuasive:  Talley's bare claim of an IRS\n\noral  misstatement  in  1988   would  not,  even  if  proved,\n\nestablish a  conventional estoppel, no  detriment of reliance\n\nhaving been described; and even a conventional estoppel might\n\nwell  not  prevail against  the  government  in a  tax  case.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427\n                                          \n\n(1990)  (\"not a  single [Supreme  Court] case  has  upheld an\n\nestoppelclaim against thegovernment forthe paymentof money\").\n\n     We   have  concluded  that   in  the   somewhat  unusual\n\ncircumstances of this  case, we need  not decide whether  the\n\ndistrict  court   in  July  1990  should   have  allowed  the\n\ncounterclaim to be pleaded.   Here, a reopening of  the trial\n\nrecord  is  warranted, in  the  interests  of justice,  based\n\nsolely  upon our  decision  that the  district court  misread\n\nrequest  no. 12.  Strictly  speaking Talley could  be held to\n\nthe  proof he offered at  trial, which was  little beyond the\n\nadmission  to  request  no.  12.    But  we  think  that  the\n\ngovernment   bears  much   of  the  responsibility   for  the\n\nimbroglio, first by not  responding to the request,  and then\n\nby  offering  inconsistent readings  of  it  to the  district\n\ncourt.    Thus,  our  remand will  permit  Talley  to  assert\n\nwhatever  evidence he has or can develop in a reasonable time\n\n                             -15-\n\nto support his  refund claim  and to  contest the  government\n\ncomputations on a basis other than request no. 12.6\n\n     By the same  token, we  think that in  the interests  of\n\njustice,  the government  should  be entitled  to assert  its\n\ncounterclaim.  Whatever  the situation may have  been in July\n\n1990,  Talley now has ample time to adduce whatever facts may\n\nbe relevant to  either the refund claim or the counterclaim--\n\nand they  are likely to be pretty much the same facts.  There\n\nis  no  surprise element  now and  the  trial record  must be\n\nreopened  in any event to permit Talley to support his refund\n\nclaim.   Our  outcome--allowing Talley  to pursue  his refund\n\nclaim and  the government to pursue its counterclaim--appears\n\nto us  to be  the most  equitable way to  shape the  required\n\nremand.\n\n     The judgment  of the district  court is vacated  and the\n                                                    \n\ncase remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this\n             \n\nopinion. \n\n                    \n\n     6There  is no  reason  why this  opportunity should  not\ninclude  reasonable additional  discovery if  Talley provides\nthe district court with  a basis to think discovery  might be\nfruitful.  \n\n                             -16-\n",

This case started as  a dispute\n                          \n\nbetween John Talley (\"Talley\"),  co-executor of the estate of\n\nPercy Talley, and the United States over the tax liability of\n\nthe  estate.  The tax issues have become snarled in confusion\n\nwrought  by  a  cryptic  notice  from  the  Internal  Revenue\n\nService,  a loosely worded request to  admit filed by Talley,\n\nand  a set  of litigation  errors by  the government.   After\n\ntrial, the district court entered judgment for  Talley on his\n\ntax refund  claim and  disallowed the government's  effort to\n\nassert a counterclaim.   We  reverse the  district court  and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n                         I. THE FACTS\n\n     In October  1984, Talley, acting as  co-executor for the\n\nestate, entered into a stipulation with the IRS regarding the\n\namount  of taxes owed by the estate.  This stipulation, filed\n\nin the  Tax  Court,  provided that  the  estate's  total  tax\n\nliability was $345,103.21.  Of this, $222,000  had been paid,\n\nleaving   an  outstanding  liability  of  $125,103.21.    The\n\nstipulation also provided that  the estate could submit proof\n\nthat it  had paid  certain state taxes,  which would  further\n\nreduce its outstanding liability.  The stipulation also noted\n\nthat of  the $345,103.21 tax liability,  $288,836.97 had been\n\n\"assessed\"and $56,266.24was a\"[d]eficiency (tobe assessed).\"2\n\n                    \n\n     2Assessment  is  the  formal   step  in  which  the  IRS\ndetermines that a specific amount of tax is currently due and\nowing  to  the  government  from  the  taxpayer,  making  the\n\n                             -2-\n\n     In  November  1984, the  IRS  sent the  estate  a notice\n\nwhich, as it  is the  cause of half  the confusion,  requires\n\ndescription.   Under  the heading  \"Statement of  Tax Due  On\n\nFederal  Tax Return,\"  it showed  as the  first entry  in the\n\n\"Assessment\" column the figure $56,266.24,  designated \"tax\";\n\nunder  this  was  the  figure  $1,478.80,  designated  \"int,\"\n\npresumably interest.   The  second column, under  the heading\n\n\"Adjustment  or  Credit,\"  contained  the  figure $57,767.39,\n\napparently  designed  to  reflect credits  against  liability\n\nallowed  by the  IRS.   Finally,  in  a third  column  headed\n\n\"Balance  Due\"  there  appeared  the  figure  $977.65,  which\n\nreflected the difference between the first column figures and\n\nthe second column figure.   In January 1985, the  estate paid\n\nthis net amount, $977.65.  \n\n     Six months later, in May 1985, the IRS sent the estate a\n\n\"Statement  of  Adjustment  to  Your Account,\"    fixing  the\n\nestate's outstanding  tax liability at $294,046.   The stated\n\nliability,  much above the net amount due under the Tax Court\n\nstipulation, appears  to include  penalties and interest  not\n\npreviously  assessed.  In  any event, the  estate declined to\n\npay.   In response, the  IRS began to  levy on bank  accounts\n\nheld  by  the   estate  and   its  distributees,   ultimately\n\ncollecting approximately $94,000.  In the  government's view,\n\n                    \n\ntaxpayer liable for that amount.  Rambo v.

Talley, by  contrast, took the  position that no\n\ntaxes were owing and that the levies were therefore unlawful.\n\n     After  exhausting administrative remedies, the estate in\n\nJanuary 1989 filed a complaint  in the district court seeking\n\na  refund  of  the  approximately  $94,000.    The  complaint\n\ncontended  that the  estate's outstanding  tax liability  had\n\nbeen  wholly  eliminated  prior  to  the  levies.    Talley's\n\ncomplaint averred  that this happy situation  resulted from a\n\ncombination  of state  tax  credits, allegedly  amounting  to\n\n$77,544, and  the November  1984 notice, which  (according to\n\nthe complaint) \"zeroed out\"  any remaining obligations of the\n\nestate to  the IRS.   The  concept of \"zeroing  out\" was  not\n\nexplained in the complaint, nor  has it been explained since.\n\n     Although the government believed  that it was still owed\n\n$200,000 or more by the estate, it neglected in answering the\n\ncomplaint to file a timely counterclaim for the balance.  See\n                                                             \n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 13.   It then  failed to respond  at all  to\n\nTalley's request  for admissions served on  the government on\n\nOctober  11, 1989, pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 36.  Request\n\nno. 12 asked the  government to admit that the  estate's $977\n\ndisbursement   in  response  to   the  November  1984  notice\n\n\"constituted full payment of the balance due on the estate of\n\nPercy Talley  as set forth  in that  notice.\"  Under  Fed. R.\n\n                             -4-\n\nCiv. P. 36(a), the failure to respond to a such  a request is\n\ndeemed  a binding  admission, unless  the court  later grants\n\nleave under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) to withdraw the admission.\n\n     New  government counsel  took  over the  case in  spring\n\n1990,  and the case was set for trial  in July 1990.  In June\n\n1990  the government  sought  leave to  amend its  answer and\n\nassert  a counterclaim.    The government's  excuse for  this\n\nbelated action was that  at the time of the  original answer,\n\ncounsel had  lacked the Secretary of  the Treasury's approval\n\nto  assert a  counterclaim.   That motion  was denied  by the\n\ndistrict  court on June 19, 1990, even though in the meantime\n\nthe court  had (for other  reasons) deferred the  trial until\n\nOctober  1990.  The court's reasons for refusing to allow the\n\ncounterclaim are discussed more fully below.\n\n     Government counsel also  advised the  district court  in\n\nJune 1990 that  the government would  promptly file a  motion\n\nseeking leave to withdraw its admission by default to request\n\nno.  12.   The government  never filed  such a  motion, later\n\ntaking the view (in  a pretrial statement filed  on September\n\n10,  1990)  that the  admission  was  literally accurate  and\n\nharmless to the government's  position.  The government's new\n\ninterpretation  was that  it had  properly admitted  that the\n\n$977  payment  constituted  full  payment  of   the  estate's\n\nliability  \"as set forth in\" the notice; but since the notice\n\nwas  inaccurate, this  admission (the government  argued) did\n\n                             -5-\n\nnot  establish  that the  payment  discharged  the taxpayer's\n\nactual liability.\n\n     A trial  was held before  the district court  on October\n\n12,  1990.  At trial, Talley based his refund claim primarily\n\nupon  the government's  admission to  request no.  12.   Over\n\nTalley's  objection, the  court permitted  the government  to\n\nintroduce evidence of Talley's tax liability according to the\n\ngovernment's  calculations.    But  the  court  accepted  the\n\nevidence subject  to the court's reserved  ruling on Talley's\n\nclaim  that  the government's  admission  of  request no.  12\n\nbarred the evidence and resolved the case.  The court stated:\n\n          Just so we are  clear, I'm allowing  [the\n          government]  to   present  this  evidence\n          because I  do not know what  I'm going to\n          do and  I wouldn't  like to have  to come\n          back  and get  some more  hearing or  get\n          some  more testimony.  . . [i]f  I decide\n          that you are stuck with  your admission .\n          .  .,   it  would   mean  you  would   be\n          precluded.\n\nThe government also moved to  amend its pleadings to  conform\n\nto the evidence introduced.\n\n     After  trial,  the  district court  issued  a memorandum\n\nopinion in which it  rejected the government's interpretation\n\nof request no. 12, and concluded that the request referred to\n\nthe  estate's  actual liability.    The court  held  that the\n\nadmission conclusively  established  that the  estate's  $977\n\npayment  satisfied its  total  tax liability,  and the  court\n\ntherefore entered  judgment in  favor of  the estate for  the\n\n                             -6-\n\napproximately $94,000 seized from the estate's bank accounts.\n\nThe government  then  appealed, arguing  that  its  admission\n\npursuant to  request no.  12 had  been wrongly  construed and\n\nthat its counterclaim should have been allowed.\n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Talley  has not  claimed in  this court  any prejudicial\n\nreliance on the original  November 1984 notice.  It  would be\n\ndifficult  as a factual matter  to make any  such claim since\n\nabout  six months later the IRS asserted that the estate owed\n\nover  $294,000,  and  there  is  no indication  that  in  the\n\nmeantime  any  detrimental reliance  had  occurred.   Indeed,\n\nauthorities do  not give  much comfort to  taxpayers invoking\n\nestoppel even when there has been reliance.  On the contrary,\n\nthe  government has  even  prosecuted  taxpayers for  cashing\n\nrefund checks issued in  error.  See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nMcRee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599230\"><a href=\"/opinion/599230/united-states-v-ann-w-mcree-joseph-h-hale/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1993).\n     \n\n     Talley's position  on appeal, however,  does not  depend\n\ndirectly on  the original  notice or upon  estoppel doctrine.\n\nRather,  it is based upon request no. 12 which the government\n\n\"admitted\" by failing to answer.  The district court read the\n\nrequest, as  admitted, to  establish that the  estate's total\n\ntax  liability  in  November  1984  was  only  $977.66.    An\n\nadmission under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a) is, by the terms of the\n\nrule, binding on the party making the admission and cannot be\n\ncontradicted.  Thus, if the district court properly construed\n\n                             -7-\n\nrequest no. 12,  the government  was bound  by its  admission\n\n(unless  the  court  sua  sponte should  have  permitted  the\n                                \n\ngovernment to withdraw the admission).\n\n     Although the question  is a close  one, we believe  that\n\nboth  the November 1984 notice  and request no.  12 have been\n\nmisconstrued.  The construction of documents presents, in the\n\nabsence of contested  background facts, a  pure issue of  law\n\nopen to  de novo review.  See Trust Under the Will of Bingham\n                                                             \n\nv. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104149\"><a href=\"/opinion/104149/trust-of-bingham-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379-80 (1945).  The  district\n               \n\ncourt's  effort  at  construction  was  complicated  by   the\n\ngovernment's  own  changes   in  position  and   its  failure\n\nadequately to place the  documents in context.  Nevertheless,\n\nwe conclude that  the original November  1984 notice did  not\n\nstate that  the estate's total  tax liability was  only $977,\n\nand the admission by default to  request no. 12 did not do so\n\neither.\n\n     The  November 1984 notice  is, of course,  an opaque and\n\npotentially misleading  document, but  in  these respects  it\n\ndoes not differ from many IRS notices apparently generated by\n\ncomputers.  No doubt  taken in isolation the notice  could be\n\nmisunderstood by a lay reader to suggest that the estate owed\n\nonly $977;  but it cannot be  taken in isolation and  that is\n\nnot what it says.  Juxtaposed with the Tax Court stipulation,\n\nit is  clear that the  November 1984  notice merely  reflects\n\nthree separate tax events: the original additional deficiency\n\n                             -8-\n\nassessment promised by  the stipulation ($56,266.24), plus  a\n\nsmall amount  of  accrued interest  ($1,478),  minus  credits\n\n($57,767.39)  allowed  by  the  IRS to  reduce  the  estate's\n\noutstanding liability.\n\n     The  net  effect  of  these  three  adjustments  was  to\n\nincrease   the  estate's   assessed   liability  by   $977.65\n\n($56,266.24  + $1,478 - $57,767.39).  That figure was, as the\n\nnotice said, a \"Balance  Due\" but only as  the net result  of\n\nthe  three  adjustments.   The notice  did  not say  that the\n\nbalance-due figure captured the estate's total tax liability.\n\nOne  who looked only at the notice might think otherwise, but\n\nany  lawyer  or  estate  executor  who  looked  also  at  the\n\nstipulation would  understand how these figures  fit together\n\nand recognize the limited role of the notice.  Indeed, only a\n\nmonth before  the estate had  stipulated to  a vastly  larger\n\ndebt of  $123,103.21  ($66,836.97 assessed  but  unpaid  plus\n\n$56,266.24 not yet assessed  but conceded) and had apparently\n\nmade no payments since then.3\n\n     This brings us to  request no. 12.  This request was the\n\nlast one in Talley's first  set of requests to admit, and  it\n\nfollowed 11  individual paragraphs  that asked only  that the\n\n                    \n\n     3In  other words, as of October 29, 1984, the estate had\nagreed that it  owed $123,103.21.   The IRS  notice the  next\nmonth allowed  a credit  of only $57,767.39,  so--quite apart\nfrom any  accrued interest  or penalties--Talley  should have\nknown that over $65,000 remained unpaid as of the date of the\nnotice.\n\n                             -9-\n\ngovernment admit that the  listed documents (in the  first 11\n\nrequest paragraphs) were \"true copies\" of what they purported\n\nto be.  No. 12 was worded somewhat differently:\n\n     Request No. 12\n                   \n\n          12.    Admit  that  the  payment  of  Nine  Hundred\n     Seventy-seven  ($977.65)  Dollars  and  65/100  by  John\n     Talley concerning  the Notice of Tax  Due dated November\n     29, 1984  (Exhibit 1),  constituted full payment  of the\n     balance due on the  estate of Percy Talley as  set forth\n     in that notice.\n\n     This last  request, whether  deliberately or not,  is an\n\ninvitation to confusion.   First, it misstates by implication\n\nthe  gist of  the  notice, leaving  the impression  (with the\n\nwords  \"full  payment\")  that  total tax  liability  was  the\n\nsubject of the notice when in fact the notice did not reflect\n\nthe total balance  due from  the estate.   Second, by  ending\n\nwith  the phrase \"as set  forth in that  notice,\" the request\n\nallows one  reader to  think that an  admission would  merely\n\nconcede  that the  estate had  in fact  paid the  amount \"set\n\nforth  in the  notice\" and  another reader  to think  that it\n\nwould concede  that the notice correctly  stated the estate's\n\ntax liability.\n\n     Of course, neither  reading makes much sense.  The first\n\nreading  of the request asks  the government to  admit a fact\n\nthat no one would dispute; the second,  to admit a point that\n\nthe government could not  ever intentionally concede, since--\n\napart  from inaccuracy--it would  give away the  lawsuit.  If\n\nthe government  had bothered to read  the request, presumably\n\n                             -10-\n\nit  would have said in  response that the  payment of $977.65\n\ndid constitute  \"full payment\"  of the amount  stated in  the\n\nnotice but  that the amount stated  at the end of  the notice\n\ndid  not reflect--or  even purport  to reflect--the  full tax\n\nliability of  the estate.   Instead,  the government  let the\n\nrequest go unanswered.4\n\n     In all  events,  we  think that  request  no.  12,  read\n\nagainst the  background of  the October 1984  stipulation and\n\nthe  November 1984 notice, cannot fairly be read as a request\n\nby Talley that the government admit  that the $977.65 payment\n\nsatisfied the actual total  liability of the estate.   To the\n\nextent that the request is ambiguous, that ambiguity is to be\n\nconstrued against Talley (whose  lawyer drafted the request).\n\nSee  Dixon v.  Commissioner,  62 T.C.M.  (C.C.H.) 1440,  1511\n                           \n\n(1991).   And to the extent  that common sense is  a guide to\n\nconstruction,  a  reading  that  trivializes  the request  is\n\npreferred  to one that renders the request absurd.  In short,\n\ntreating the  government as  bound by  its  admission of  the\n\nrequest,  we believe it has  admitted only what  it has never\n\ndenied: that  the $977.65 payment corresponded  to the amount\n\nset forth in the notice.\n\n                    \n\n     4When it got around to reading the request in June 1989,\nthe government then compounded the confusion by first reading\nthe request  as Talley  now urges  (and telling  the district\ncourt  that it would move to withdraw the admission) and then\nreading the request merely to admit that the amount stated in\nthe request  had  been  paid  (making  a  withdrawal  of  the\nadmission unnecessary).\n\n                             -11-\n\n     Since  in  our  view  the  district  court  misconstrued\n\nrequest  no. 12, its judgment in favor of Talley--which rests\n\nsolely  on the  government's  admission of  request no.  12--\n\ncannot stand.   The scope of  the remand is addressed  at the\n\nconclusion of this opinion.  We do not reach the government's\n\nalternative  argument  that,  if  the request  were  read  in\n\nTalley's  favor,   then  the  government  should   have  been\n\npermitted to withdraw its admission.  Such an argument itself\n\nraises  troublesome  questions  that  we  readily  leave  for\n\nanother day.5\n\n     The  other issue  presented  by the  government on  this\n\nappeal is whether the district court erred when it refused to\n\npermit the  government belatedly to file a  counterclaim.  It\n\nwill be recalled  that Talley sued the  government to recover\n\nthe levies against the estate bank account amounting to about\n\n$94,000.   From  the  government's standpoint,  not only  did\n\nTalley have no right to a refund but, in addition, the estate\n\nstill  owed the  government for  unpaid taxes,  penalties and\n\ninterest, which the levies had only  partially recovered.  It\n\nis undisputed that the government's claim for any balance due\n\n                    \n\n     5For example, whether Talley's reliance on the admission\nwas unreasonable; whether Talley would suffer any \"prejudice\"\nfrom a belated withdrawal in the technical sense specified by\nRule 36(b);  and whether  the government's motion  to conform\nthe  pleadings  to the  evidence  could  be  construed as  an\nimplied, conditional request to withdraw the admission.\n\n                             -12-\n\nis a compulsory counterclaim  which, if not properly asserted\n\nin this case, is lost forever.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a).\n\n     Under the rules, the government should have asserted its\n\ncounterclaim when answering Talley's complaint.  Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  13(a).  Instead, it waited for over  a year and a half to\n\ndo so, explaining that  it had not asserted the claim  in its\n\nanswer because it needed to await approval from the Secretary\n\nof the  Treasury.  At the time its motion to amend the answer\n\nwas  filed in  June 1990,  the case  was then  on the  eve of\n\ntrial.  The trial date was then postponed for several months,\n\nfrom  June to October,  when the government  proposed to call\n\nTalley's  counsel  as  a  witness,  but  the  district  court\n\nnevertheless ruled after the postponement that the motion for\n\nleave to file the counterclaim came too late.\n\n     \"It is incomprehensible,\" said the district court, \"that\n\nit took the government well over one year to obtain authority\n\nfrom the Secretary of  the Treasury . . . .\"   The court also\n\nsaid  that  allowing the  counterclaim  at  this point  would\n\nexpose Talley \"to significant prejudice at  this stage of the\n\nproceeding,\" as well as  \"to substantial inconvenience.\"  The\n\ndistrict court did not  explain the basis for any  finding of\n\neither  prejudice  or  inconvenience.    Talley's  memorandum\n\nopposing the  motion to  assert the  counterclaim did  make a\n\nclaim of prejudice; in  somewhat veiled fashion, it suggested\n\nthat,   if  the  estate  had   been  timely  advised  of  the\n\n                             -13-\n\ncounterclaim, it  would have summoned witnesses  to show that\n\noral  statements  of  an  IRS  representative  in  July  1988\n\nconceded  \"that no  liability  remained with  regard to  this\n\nestate.\" \n\n     How this issue--the district court's refusal to permit a\n\nbelated counterclaim--should be resolved in the ordinary case\n\nis  open to debate.   On the  one hand, the  government's 18-\n\nmonth delay in advancing  its counterclaim is substantial and\n\nits excuse lame; perhaps  the Secretary had not approved  the\n\ncounterclaim when the answer was due but that did not require\n\nthe government to  wait for 18 months, until  after discovery\n\nwas completed, to assert a counterclaim that was evident from\n\nthe outset.   Trial judges, who  have considerable discretion\n\nin such  matters, are  understandably loath to  entertain new\n\nclaims  in  June  when  trial  is  scheduled  for July,  when\n\ndiscovery  has been  completed, and  when the  government has\n\nlittle excuse for so long a delay in asserting its claim.\n\n     The government,  on the  other  hand, reasonably  argues\n\nthat its counterclaim motion was not resolved until after the\n\ntrial  had   been   postponed  until   October,   alleviating\n\ninconvenience.   More important, virtually the  same evidence\n\nthe government would be expected to offer to refute  Talley's\n\nrefund  claim would,  if the  government's proof  were valid,\n\nalso  establish  its  own  right  to  affirmative   recovery.\n\nFinally, the only \"prejudice\"  from a withdrawal described by\n\n                             -14-\n\nTalley is not very persuasive:  Talley's bare claim of an IRS\n\noral  misstatement  in  1988   would  not,  even  if  proved,\n\nestablish a  conventional estoppel, no  detriment of reliance\n\nhaving been described; and even a conventional estoppel might\n\nwell  not  prevail against  the  government  in a  tax  case.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management v. Richmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112458\"><a href=\"/opinion/112458/office-of-personnel-management-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427\n                                          \n\n(1990)  (\"not a  single [Supreme  Court] case  has  upheld an\n\nestoppelclaim against thegovernment forthe paymentof money\").\n\n     We   have  concluded  that   in  the   somewhat  unusual\n\ncircumstances of this  case, we need  not decide whether  the\n\ndistrict  court   in  July  1990  should   have  allowed  the\n\ncounterclaim to be pleaded.   Here, a reopening of  the trial\n\nrecord  is  warranted, in  the  interests  of justice,  based\n\nsolely  upon our  decision  that the  district court  misread\n\nrequest  no. 12.  Strictly  speaking Talley could  be held to\n\nthe  proof he offered at  trial, which was  little beyond the\n\nadmission  to  request  no.  12.    But  we  think  that  the\n\ngovernment   bears  much   of  the  responsibility   for  the\n\nimbroglio, first by not  responding to the request,  and then\n\nby  offering  inconsistent readings  of  it  to the  district\n\ncourt.    Thus,  our  remand will  permit  Talley  to  assert\n\nwhatever  evidence he has or can develop in a reasonable time\n\n                             -15-\n\nto support his  refund claim  and to  contest the  government\n\ncomputations on a basis other than request no. 12.6\n\n     By the same  token, we  think that in  the interests  of\n\njustice,  the government  should  be entitled  to assert  its\n\ncounterclaim.  Whatever  the situation may have  been in July\n\n1990,  Talley now has ample time to adduce whatever facts may\n\nbe relevant to  either the refund claim or the counterclaim--\n\nand they  are likely to be pretty much the same facts.  There\n\nis  no  surprise element  now and  the  trial record  must be\n\nreopened  in any event to permit Talley to support his refund\n\nclaim.   Our  outcome--allowing Talley  to pursue  his refund\n\nclaim and  the government to pursue its counterclaim--appears\n\nto us  to be  the most  equitable way to  shape the  required\n\nremand.\n\n     The judgment  of the district  court is vacated  and the\n                                                    \n\ncase remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this\n             \n\nopinion. \n\n                    \n\n     6There  is no  reason  why this  opportunity should  not\ninclude  reasonable additional  discovery if  Talley provides\nthe district court with  a basis to think discovery  might be\nfruitful.  \n\n                             -16-\n</pre>",
