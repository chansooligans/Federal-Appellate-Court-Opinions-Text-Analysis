This is a  pro se appeal from a jury\n                     \n\nverdict in  a personal injury case and from a district  court\n\norder dismissing plaintiff-appellant's motion for a new trial\n\non the grounds of  jury misconduct.  After a  three-day trial\n\nat  which  appellant was  represented  by  counsel, the  jury\n\ndetermined that appellant was  comparatively negligent for 95\n\npercent of the  $5,000 awarded to her in  damages.  The award\n\nwas therefore  reduced  to $250.00.   Appellant  moved for  a\n\nmistrial on the  grounds of  jury misconduct.   After a  full\n\nevidentiary hearing,  the district court  denied the  motion.\n\nWe affirm both the judgment and  the denial of the motion for\n\nmistrial.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          Appellant filed this diversity action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\ndefendant F.W. Woolworth  Co.1  The complaint alleged that on\n\nDecember 16, 1988, appellant  Mary Louise Santoni was injured\n\nwhile riding  on an escalator  in one of  defendant's stores.\n\nAppellant  alleged  that  the  escalator was  running  at  an\n\nexcessive  speed, causing her  to lose her  balance and fall.\n\nAppellant further  claimed that the emergency  button to stop\n\nthe  escalator   had  been  covered  with   tape,  making  it\n\n                    \n\n1.   Otis Elevator Co. was  brought into the case as a  third\nparty  defendant,  but  the  court granted  Otis'  motion  to\ndismiss  the action against it  on the basis  of the evidence\npresented at trial.\n\n                             -4-\n\ninaccessible,  and that  Woolworth's employees  ignored calls\n\nfor help.   Appellant, who was in her early eighties when the\n\naccident   occurred,  allegedly   suffered  great   pain  and\n\ncontinues  to suffer  from hearing  loss and  irregular heart\n\nrate,  dizziness,   fear  and  depression  as   a  result  of\n\nappellee's   negligence.      Appellant's  complaint   sought\n\n$500,000.00 in damages.\n\n          A three-day  jury trial was held  from February 24,\n\n1992 through February 26,  1992.  After the jury  verdict was\n\nentered, appellant filed  a motion for  mistrial on March  2,\n\n1992.   The motion  alleged that relatives  of appellant  had\n\nreported seeing a juror talking with defendant's witnesses in\n\nthe hallway of the  courthouse before the jury had  reached a\n\nverdict.   Attached to  the motion  were sworn  statements by\n\nthree of appellant's  relatives indicating  that on  February\n\n26, 1992,  during  a  court recess,  they  observed  a  juror\n\ntalking with  witnesses and counsel for the defendant.\n\n          On May 1, 1992,  the district court held a  hearing\n\non the motion for  mistrial.  Appellant, who  was represented\n\nby  counsel at the  hearing, called three  witnesses, a court\n\nsecurity  officer and  two of  appellant's relatives  who had\n\nreported witnessing the alleged misconduct.   Appellee called\n\nfour witnesses,  including the  juror accused of  the alleged\n\nmisconduct, a  court security  officer and the  two witnesses\n\nwith whom  the juror was alleged  to have conversed.   All of\n\n                             -5-\n\nappellee's  witnesses  denied   that  there   had  been   any\n\ncommunication  between  the  juror  and  the   witnesses  and\n\nattorney for  the appellee.   The  attorney for  the appellee\n\nalso testified that he had not spoken to the juror.\n\n          In an  opinion dated  August 4, 1992,  the district\n\ncourt found that the  jury \"remained impartial throughout the\n\ntrial  and  during the  crucial  deliberations.\"   The  court\n\ncredited  appellee's witnesses  and concluded  that appellant\n\nhad failed  to produce credible evidence  of jury misconduct.\n\nThe  court  noted  that appellee  had  failed  to report  the\n\nalleged  misconduct to the  court or to  their attorney until\n\nafter the jury verdict was  entered, although more than eight\n\nhours  elapsed   between  the  alleged  misconduct   and  the\n\nannouncement of  the jury's  verdict.   The court  also found\n\nthat  \"the verdict  rendered is  clearly consistent  with the\n\nweight  of  evidence  adduced  at  trial.\"    Therefore,  the\n\ndistrict court denied appellant's motion for a new trial.  \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          On  appeal,  Mrs.  Santoni  argues  that  the  jury\n\nverdict  finding  her comparably  negligent  for  95% of  the\n\ndamages caused  was contrary to  the weight of  the evidence.\n\nShe also argues that the district court abused its discretion\n\nin  denying  her  motion  for  a  mistrial  based  upon  jury\n\nmisconduct.   Finally, she finds fault  with the court's jury\n\ninstructions.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n     Sufficiency of Evidence.\n                             \n\n          Appellant  failed   to   preserve  the   issue   of\n\nsufficiency of  the evidence for  appeal.  She  neither moved\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence, nor\n\nrenewed  her motion after entry of judgment. See Fed. R. Civ.\n                                                \n\nP.  50.   Nonetheless,  even if  appellant had  preserved the\n\nissue  for appeal, she would  not prevail under the following\n\napplicable standard of review:\n\n     To  determine  whether   sufficient  evidence   was\n     offered  at trial  to  support  the jury's  factual\n     findings, the  court must view the  evidence in the\n     light most favorable to the nonmoving party, giving\n     that   party  the  benefit  of  all  the  favorable\n     inferences that may be drawn.\n\nAggarwal  v. Ponce School of  Medicine, 837 F.2d  17, 19 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1988).   On appeal,  the jury's verdict  must be  upheld\n\nunless \"the court finds that the evidence points 'so strongly\n\nand overwhelmingly in  favor of the movant that  a reasonable\n\njury could  not have  arrived at [the]  conclusion reached.'\"\n\nId. (quoting Chedd-Angier Production Co. v. Omni Publications\n                                                             \n\nInt'l, Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 934 (1st Cir. 1985)).\n           \n\n          Appellant argues that \"there can be no contributory\n\nnegligence  on  the  part   of  Plaintiff  in  [the]  special\n\ncircumstances [of  this  case].\"    Those  circumstances  are\n\n\"uncontroverted evidence describing the electric stairways as\n\nan unregulated and unsyncronized electric stairway\"on   which\n\nthe elderly plaintiff was  \"violently thrown back . .  ., and\n\nthen dragged up to the second floor . . . without any help or\n\n                             -7-\n\nassistance  of  the   store's  employees.\"     According   to\n\nappellant, \"the uncontroverted evidence  as to the total lack\n\nof  adequate  control  by  the Store  of  the  high  velocity\n\nmovement  of the  electric stairway  was responsible  for the\n\nunfortunate accident  amounting to 100% of  the negligence of\n\nthe Store.\"\n\n          Contrary to appellant's  allegations, however,  the\n\nevidence  was  far   from  uncontroverted.    The   following\n\ntestimony was presented, from which the jury could have found\n\nthat  appellant was negligent in her use of the escalator and\n\nthat  appellee's negligence  was only  marginally responsible\n\nfor the  accident.   Mr. Mendez,  a supervisor  at appellee's\n\nstore  at the  time of  the accident,  testified that  he saw\n\nappellant  struggling with her  granddaughter before boarding\n\nthe  escalator and advised them that  appellant should not be\n\nmade  to ride the escalator  in her condition  and that there\n\nwas an  alternative means of access to the second floor.   He\n\nfurther testified  that when he  later heard a  commotion and\n\nsaw  that   appellant  had   fallen  on  the   escalator,  he\n\nimmediately  shut it off,  using the emergency  button on the\n\nfirst  floor.  Mr. Mendez stated that after the accident, the\n\nescalator  was turned back on  and that it  continued to work\n\n\"perfectly\".  Finally,  he testified that he  did not observe\n\nthat  the speed of the  escalator that day  differed from its\n\nspeed on any other day before or since the accident.\n\n                             -8-\n\n          Appellee's other witness,  Mr. Grimani, manager  of\n\nthe  Woolworth store at  the time of  the accident, testified\n\nthat in  his ten years of  working at the store  he never saw\n\nthe  escalator accelerate  beyond its normal  operating speed\n\nnor received a complaint regarding its speed.  He stated that\n\nin  his 33 years of  employment with Woolworth,  he had never\n\nheard of an escalator accelerating.\n\n          Third party defendant, Otis Elevator Co., put on an\n\nexpert  witness in  electronics,  Mr. Abraham.   Mr.  Abraham\n\ntestified that the type  of motor which drives  the escalator\n\nmakes acceleration  impossible.   He explained that  the only\n\nway  that the  speed  of an  escalator can  be changed  is to\n\nreplace the gear box  and motor.  Mr. Abraham  testified that\n\nthe  escalator in  question ran  at 90  feet per  minute, the\n\nindustry standard, on the day of the accident. \n\n          Appellant introduced contrary  evidence in  support\n\nof her theory that the accident was caused by acceleration of\n\nthe  escalator  and the  appellee's  employees' inability  to\n\ncontrol it.   Mrs. Santoni  testified that  when she  stepped\n\nonto the escalator and  placed her hand on the  handrail, she\n\nfelt a strong pull  which caused her to lose  her balance and\n\nfall backward.   Mrs. Monegro, another customer at appellee's\n\nstore  on the day of the accident, testified that she noticed\n\nthat the escalator going  from the first to the  second level\n\nwas \"going too  fast\".   She further testified  that when she\n\n                             -9-\n\nlearned that a lady  had fallen on the escalator,  she looked\n\nfor the emergency button to stop the escalator but was unable\n\nto find it.  \n\n          Mr. Freyre, appellant's grandson, testified that he\n\nwas at  the store  with his  grandmother on  the  day of  the\n\naccident and noticed that the escalator between the first and\n\nsecond  level was running \"very  fast\".  He further testified\n\nthat  after his grandmother's  accident he tried  to stop the\n\nescalator  but could  not locate  the emergency button.   Mr.\n\nFreyre stated that he later saw an employee remove black tape\n\ncovering the  emergency button, before pushing  the button to\n\nstop  the escalator.    Finally, he  testified  that when  he\n\nreturned to  the store,  two  days later,  the escalator  was\n\nrunning  at  a normal  (slower) speed  and  that tape  was no\n\nlonger covering the emergency buttons.\n\n          Mrs.  Freyre, appellant's  granddaughter, testified\n\nthat she was with appellant at the time of the accident.  She\n\nstated that  her grandmother was told by a Woolworth employee\n\nthat the escalator was the only means of access to the second\n\nfloor. Mrs. Freyre testified that the escalator \"was going at\n\na  high  rate  of  speed\" when  appellant  stepped  onto  it.\n\nFinally, Mrs. Rivera,  another customer at appellant's  store\n\non the day of the accident, testified that she  rode the same\n\nescalator as appellant,  shortly before appellant's accident,\n\nand  noticed that it was fast.   She stated that when she saw\n\n                             -10-\n\nappellant fall she tried to find the emergency button to stop\n\nthe escalator, but was  unable to locate it.   Appellant also\n\nintroduced into  evidence at the trial  five accident reports\n\nof other falls on the escalators in appellant's store  during\n\n1988.\n\n          Based  upon  the  evidence   presented  (summarized\n\nabove), the  jury concluded  that appellee was  negligent and\n\nthat its negligence proximately caused some of  the injury or\n\ndamage  suffered by  appellant.   It further  found, however,\n\nthat  appellant  was  comparatively  negligent  and  that her\n\nnegligence was  responsible  for 95%  of  the damages.    The\n\nevidence,   although   conflicting,   does   not   point   so\n\noverwhelmingly in  favor of appellant that  a reasonable jury\n\ncould  not have  arrived at  this conclusion.   \"[I]t  is for\n\njurors,  not judges, to weigh the  evidence and determine the\n\ncredibility of witnesses.\" Insurance  Co. of North America v.\n                                                          \n\nMusa, 785 F.2d 370, 372  (1st Cir. 1986).  It was  the jury's\n    \n\nright to credit appellee's witnesses and to conclude that the\n\nescalator  was  not running  at an  excessive speed  and that\n\nappellant's  own actions,  for  example  her unsteadiness  or\n\nmisplacement  of  her cane,  caused her  to  fall.   The jury\n\nverdict is supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nJury Misconduct\n               \n\n          A district  court's decision denying  a motion  for\n\nnew   trial  will  not  be   reversed  except  for  abuse  of\n\n                             -11-\n\ndiscretion. Real v.  Hogan, 828 F.2d  58,61 (1st Cir.  1987).\n                          \n\nThe district court, following appellant's allegation of juror\n\nmisconduct, properly  carried out its duty  to investigate to\n\nascertain  whether the  misconduct actually occurred,  and if\n\nso, whether it was prejudicial.  See United States v. Boylan,\n                                                            \n\n898  F.2d 230,  258 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 498  U.S. 849\n                                              \n\n(1990).    The district court held a full evidentiary hearing\n\nat which  witnesses for appellant and  appellee testified and\n\nwere cross-examined under oath.\n\n          Upon review of the record, including the transcript\n\nof  the evidentiary  hearing, we  conclude that  the district\n\ncourt did  not abuse its  discretion in determining  that the\n\nalleged  misconduct  did  not  occur.    At  the  evidentiary\n\nhearing,  appellant's principal  witnesses were  her son  and\n\ngrandson who  testified  that  they  saw one  of  the  jurors\n\nconverse with witnesses and counsel for the defendants in the\n\nhallway of the courthouse on the morning  of the final day of\n\nthe  trial,  eight hours  before  the  verdict was  rendered.\n\nAppellee called the juror,  witnesses and attorney alleged to\n\nhave  engaged  in the  misconduct to  testify.   All  of them\n\ndenied that the conversation had ever occurred.    \n\n          The juror testified that  he had been approached by\n\na  woman,   unconnected  with   the  case,  outside   of  the\n\ncourthouse, who told him that one of appellee's witnesses was\n\nfrom the  same home  town as  the juror.   The  juror stated,\n\n                             -12-\n\nhowever, that he was not influenced  by this information. Our\n\nreview of the record supports the district court's conclusion\n\nthat  sufficient  evidence  was  produced to  show  that  the\n\ncommunication did  not have a prejudicial effect.   There was\n\nno  abuse of discretion.   See United States  v. O'Brien, 972\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Moreover, by  failing to inform the  district court\n\nabout the alleged juror misconduct until five hours after the\n\nverdict was rendered, although she had allegedly become aware\n\nof  the  impropriety  eight  hours  before  the  verdict  was\n\nentered, appellant  waived the  right to complain  about such\n\nconduct.  See United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1992),  cert. denied,      U.S.    , 113 S.Ct.  1588 (1993). \n                    \n\nEven absent  waiver, however, we  conclude that there  was no\n\nmiscarriage  of  justice and  therefore  affirm  the district\n\ncourt's denial of appellant's motion for a new trial.\n\nJury Instructions\n                 \n\n          Appellant's  final argument  is  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in instructing the jury.  First, appellant argues\n\nthat  the court in its opinion mischaracterized the case as a\n\n\"slip and fall\" case  and that its misconception of  the case\n\nwas reflected  in the  jury instructions.   Second, appellant\n\ncontends  that the  district court  erred in  instructing the\n\njury  regarding dismissal  of  the third-party  defendant  as\n\nfollows:\n\n                             -13-\n\n     Otis Elevator Company  is no longer  with us.   The\n     case  of Otis was disposed of in such a manner that\n     you  don't need to  concern yourself  with anything\n     pertaining to it.   Forget  about it.   Otis is  no\n     longer  a part of this case and I repeat, you don't\n     need to be concerned with it. \n\nAppellant argues  that this instruction sent a message to the\n\njury  that   the  malfunction   of  the  escalator   was  not\n\nresponsible for the accident.\n\n          The  record  indicates  that  appellant  failed  to\n\nobject to the  jury instructions before  the jury retired  to\n\nconsider  the verdict,  as required  by Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 51.\n\nRule 51 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     No  party may  assign as  error the  giving  of the\n     failure to  give an  instruction unless that  party\n     objects thereto before the jury retires to consider\n     its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected\n     to and the grounds of the objection.\n\n\"In the absence of  compliance with the dictates of  Rule 51,\n\nwe  review for plain error.\" Elgabri v. Lekas, 964 F.2d 1255,\n                                             \n\n1259 (1st Cir.  1992).   Our review of  the district  court's\n\ninstructions to the jury does not reveal any \"miscarriage  of\n\njustice.\" Id.  at 1259.  Therefore, we find no plain error in\n             \n\nthe jury instructions.\n\n          Although the  district court referred  to this case\n\nas a \"slip and fall\" case in its opinion, it did not do so in\n\nits jury  instructions.  Moreover, such a reference would not\n\nhave  constituted plain  error.    The detailed  instructions\n\ngiven  corrected any  misconception that  the term  \"slip and\n\nfall\"  might  have  conveyed.   The  court  correctly  stated\n\n                             -14-\n\ncurrent Puerto Rico  law with  respect to  negligence in  the\n\ncontext of this case.  See Mas v. United States, No. 92-1392,\n                                               \n\nslip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 1993).  Moreover, the jury\n\nfound  that appellee was negligent.  There was no plain error\n\nhere.\n\n          Appellant  fares   no  better  with   her  argument\n\nregarding  the court's  instructions about  the dismissal  of\n\nOtis  Elevator Co.   Even  assuming that  the portion  of the\n\ninstructions relating  to  the third  party defendant,  taken\n\nalone, might  have improperly directed  the jury's  attention\n\naway  from the role of the escalator in causing the accident,\n\nwhen we consider  the instructions  as a whole,  it is  clear\n\nthat no miscarriage of justice resulted. Cf. United States v.\n                                                          \n\nO'Brien, 972 at 16 (\"so long as the charge, taken as a whole,\n       \n\ncorrectly  conveys the  concept  of reasonable  doubt to  the\n\njury,  no  reversible error  exists\").    The district  court\n\ncarefully  instructed the jury  that appellee  had a  duty to\n\n\"maintain the  business place in  such a safe  condition that\n\none  who is induced to  enter the premises,  would not suffer\n\ndamage.\"    As  thus   described,  appellant's  duty  clearly\n\nextended to maintenance of the escalator.  The manufacturer's\n\ndismissal from the case  did not preclude a finding  that the\n\nescalator was not maintained in \"a safe condition.\"  \n\n          For all of the  foregoing reasons, the judgment and\n\nthe denial  of appellant's motion for  mistrial are affirmed.\n                                                            \n\n                             -15-\n\nAppellee's request for damages and costs  pursuant to Fed.

This is a  pro se appeal from a jury\n                     \n\nverdict in  a personal injury case and from a district  court\n\norder dismissing plaintiff-appellant's motion for a new trial\n\non the grounds of  jury misconduct.  After a  three-day trial\n\nat  which  appellant was  represented  by  counsel, the  jury\n\ndetermined that appellant was  comparatively negligent for 95\n\npercent of the  $5,000 awarded to her in  damages.  The award\n\nwas therefore  reduced  to $250.00.   Appellant  moved for  a\n\nmistrial on the  grounds of  jury misconduct.   After a  full\n\nevidentiary hearing,  the district court  denied the  motion.\n\nWe affirm both the judgment and  the denial of the motion for\n\nmistrial.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          Appellant filed this diversity action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against\n\ndefendant F.W. Woolworth  Co.1  The complaint alleged that on\n\nDecember 16, 1988, appellant  Mary Louise Santoni was injured\n\nwhile riding  on an escalator  in one of  defendant's stores.\n\nAppellant  alleged  that  the  escalator was  running  at  an\n\nexcessive  speed, causing her  to lose her  balance and fall.\n\nAppellant further  claimed that the emergency  button to stop\n\nthe  escalator   had  been  covered  with   tape,  making  it\n\n                    \n\n1.   Otis Elevator Co. was  brought into the case as a  third\nparty  defendant,  but  the  court granted  Otis'  motion  to\ndismiss  the action against it  on the basis  of the evidence\npresented at trial.\n\n                             -4-\n\ninaccessible,  and that  Woolworth's employees  ignored calls\n\nfor help.   Appellant, who was in her early eighties when the\n\naccident   occurred,  allegedly   suffered  great   pain  and\n\ncontinues  to suffer  from hearing  loss and  irregular heart\n\nrate,  dizziness,   fear  and  depression  as   a  result  of\n\nappellee's   negligence.      Appellant's  complaint   sought\n\n$500,000.00 in damages.\n\n          A three-day  jury trial was held  from February 24,\n\n1992 through February 26,  1992.  After the jury  verdict was\n\nentered, appellant filed  a motion for  mistrial on March  2,\n\n1992.   The motion  alleged that relatives  of appellant  had\n\nreported seeing a juror talking with defendant's witnesses in\n\nthe hallway of the  courthouse before the jury had  reached a\n\nverdict.   Attached to  the motion  were sworn  statements by\n\nthree of appellant's  relatives indicating  that on  February\n\n26, 1992,  during  a  court recess,  they  observed  a  juror\n\ntalking with  witnesses and counsel for the defendant.\n\n          On May 1, 1992,  the district court held a  hearing\n\non the motion for  mistrial.  Appellant, who  was represented\n\nby  counsel at the  hearing, called three  witnesses, a court\n\nsecurity  officer and  two of  appellant's relatives  who had\n\nreported witnessing the alleged misconduct.   Appellee called\n\nfour witnesses,  including the  juror accused of  the alleged\n\nmisconduct, a  court security  officer and the  two witnesses\n\nwith whom  the juror was alleged  to have conversed.   All of\n\n                             -5-\n\nappellee's  witnesses  denied   that  there   had  been   any\n\ncommunication  between  the  juror  and  the   witnesses  and\n\nattorney for  the appellee.   The  attorney for  the appellee\n\nalso testified that he had not spoken to the juror.\n\n          In an  opinion dated  August 4, 1992,  the district\n\ncourt found that the  jury \"remained impartial throughout the\n\ntrial  and  during the  crucial  deliberations.\"   The  court\n\ncredited  appellee's witnesses  and concluded  that appellant\n\nhad failed  to produce credible evidence  of jury misconduct.\n\nThe  court  noted  that appellee  had  failed  to report  the\n\nalleged  misconduct to the  court or to  their attorney until\n\nafter the jury verdict was  entered, although more than eight\n\nhours  elapsed   between  the  alleged  misconduct   and  the\n\nannouncement of  the jury's  verdict.   The court  also found\n\nthat  \"the verdict  rendered is  clearly consistent  with the\n\nweight  of  evidence  adduced  at  trial.\"    Therefore,  the\n\ndistrict court denied appellant's motion for a new trial.  \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          On  appeal,  Mrs.  Santoni  argues  that  the  jury\n\nverdict  finding  her comparably  negligent  for  95% of  the\n\ndamages caused  was contrary to  the weight of  the evidence.\n\nShe also argues that the district court abused its discretion\n\nin  denying  her  motion  for  a  mistrial  based  upon  jury\n\nmisconduct.   Finally, she finds fault  with the court's jury\n\ninstructions.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n     Sufficiency of Evidence.\n                             \n\n          Appellant  failed   to   preserve  the   issue   of\n\nsufficiency of  the evidence for  appeal.  She  neither moved\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence, nor\n\nrenewed  her motion after entry of judgment. See Fed. R. Civ.\n                                                \n\nP.  50.   Nonetheless,  even if  appellant had  preserved the\n\nissue  for appeal, she would  not prevail under the following\n\napplicable standard of review:\n\n     To  determine  whether   sufficient  evidence   was\n     offered  at trial  to  support  the jury's  factual\n     findings, the  court must view the  evidence in the\n     light most favorable to the nonmoving party, giving\n     that   party  the  benefit  of  all  the  favorable\n     inferences that may be drawn.\n\nAggarwal  v.

On appeal,  the jury's verdict  must be  upheld\n\nunless \"the court finds that the evidence points 'so strongly\n\nand overwhelmingly in  favor of the movant that  a reasonable\n\njury could  not have  arrived at [the]  conclusion reached.'\"\n\nId.

The   following\n\ntestimony was presented, from which the jury could have found\n\nthat  appellant was negligent in her use of the escalator and\n\nthat  appellee's negligence  was only  marginally responsible\n\nfor the  accident.   Mr. Mendez,  a supervisor  at appellee's\n\nstore  at the  time of  the accident,  testified that  he saw\n\nappellant  struggling with her  granddaughter before boarding\n\nthe  escalator and advised them that  appellant should not be\n\nmade  to ride the escalator  in her condition  and that there\n\nwas an  alternative means of access to the second floor.   He\n\nfurther testified  that when he  later heard a  commotion and\n\nsaw  that   appellant  had   fallen  on  the   escalator,  he\n\nimmediately  shut it off,  using the emergency  button on the\n\nfirst  floor.  Mr. Mendez stated that after the accident, the\n\nescalator  was turned back on  and that it  continued to work\n\n\"perfectly\".  Finally,  he testified that he  did not observe\n\nthat  the speed of the  escalator that day  differed from its\n\nspeed on any other day before or since the accident.\n\n                             -8-\n\n          Appellee's other witness,  Mr. Grimani, manager  of\n\nthe  Woolworth store at  the time of  the accident, testified\n\nthat in  his ten years of  working at the store  he never saw\n\nthe  escalator accelerate  beyond its normal  operating speed\n\nnor received a complaint regarding its speed.  He stated that\n\nin  his 33 years of  employment with Woolworth,  he had never\n\nheard of an escalator accelerating.\n\n          Third party defendant, Otis Elevator Co., put on an\n\nexpert  witness in  electronics,  Mr. Abraham.   Mr.  Abraham\n\ntestified that the type  of motor which drives  the escalator\n\nmakes acceleration  impossible.   He explained that  the only\n\nway  that the  speed  of an  escalator can  be changed  is to\n\nreplace the gear box  and motor.  Mr. Abraham  testified that\n\nthe  escalator in  question ran  at 90  feet per  minute, the\n\nindustry standard, on the day of the accident. \n\n          Appellant introduced contrary  evidence in  support\n\nof her theory that the accident was caused by acceleration of\n\nthe  escalator  and the  appellee's  employees' inability  to\n\ncontrol it.   Mrs. Santoni  testified that  when she  stepped\n\nonto the escalator and  placed her hand on the  handrail, she\n\nfelt a strong pull  which caused her to lose  her balance and\n\nfall backward.   Mrs. Monegro, another customer at appellee's\n\nstore  on the day of the accident, testified that she noticed\n\nthat the escalator going  from the first to the  second level\n\nwas \"going too  fast\".   She further testified  that when she\n\n                             -9-\n\nlearned that a lady  had fallen on the escalator,  she looked\n\nfor the emergency button to stop the escalator but was unable\n\nto find it.  \n\n          Mr. Freyre, appellant's grandson, testified that he\n\nwas at  the store  with his  grandmother on  the  day of  the\n\naccident and noticed that the escalator between the first and\n\nsecond  level was running \"very  fast\".  He further testified\n\nthat  after his grandmother's  accident he tried  to stop the\n\nescalator  but could  not locate  the emergency button.   Mr.\n\nFreyre stated that he later saw an employee remove black tape\n\ncovering the  emergency button, before pushing  the button to\n\nstop  the escalator.    Finally, he  testified  that when  he\n\nreturned to  the store,  two  days later,  the escalator  was\n\nrunning  at  a normal  (slower) speed  and  that tape  was no\n\nlonger covering the emergency buttons.\n\n          Mrs.  Freyre, appellant's  granddaughter, testified\n\nthat she was with appellant at the time of the accident.  She\n\nstated that  her grandmother was told by a Woolworth employee\n\nthat the escalator was the only means of access to the second\n\nfloor. Mrs. Freyre testified that the escalator \"was going at\n\na  high  rate  of  speed\" when  appellant  stepped  onto  it.\n\nFinally, Mrs. Rivera,  another customer at appellant's  store\n\non the day of the accident, testified that she  rode the same\n\nescalator as appellant,  shortly before appellant's accident,\n\nand  noticed that it was fast.   She stated that when she saw\n\n                             -10-\n\nappellant fall she tried to find the emergency button to stop\n\nthe escalator, but was  unable to locate it.   Appellant also\n\nintroduced into  evidence at the trial  five accident reports\n\nof other falls on the escalators in appellant's store  during\n\n1988.\n\n          Based  upon  the  evidence   presented  (summarized\n\nabove), the  jury concluded  that appellee was  negligent and\n\nthat its negligence proximately caused some of  the injury or\n\ndamage  suffered by  appellant.   It further  found, however,\n\nthat  appellant  was  comparatively  negligent  and  that her\n\nnegligence was  responsible  for 95%  of  the damages.    The\n\nevidence,   although   conflicting,   does   not   point   so\n\noverwhelmingly in  favor of appellant that  a reasonable jury\n\ncould  not have  arrived at  this conclusion.   \"[I]t  is for\n\njurors,  not judges, to weigh the  evidence and determine the\n\ncredibility of witnesses.\" Insurance  Co. of North America v.\n                                                          \n\nMusa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466084\"><a href=\"/opinion/466084/insurance-company-of-north-america-v-hassan-a-musa-appeal-of-jamal-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372  (1st Cir. 1986).  It was  the jury's\n    \n\nright to credit appellee's witnesses and to conclude that the\n\nescalator  was  not running  at an  excessive speed  and that\n\nappellant's  own actions,  for  example  her unsteadiness  or\n\nmisplacement  of  her cane,  caused her  to  fall.

Boylan,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  258 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                              \n\n(1990).    The district court held a full evidentiary hearing\n\nat which  witnesses for appellant and  appellee testified and\n\nwere cross-examined under oath.\n\n          Upon review of the record, including the transcript\n\nof  the evidentiary  hearing, we  conclude that  the district\n\ncourt did  not abuse its  discretion in determining  that the\n\nalleged  misconduct  did  not  occur.    At  the  evidentiary\n\nhearing,  appellant's principal  witnesses were  her son  and\n\ngrandson who  testified  that  they  saw one  of  the  jurors\n\nconverse with witnesses and counsel for the defendants in the\n\nhallway of the courthouse on the morning  of the final day of\n\nthe  trial,  eight hours  before  the  verdict was  rendered.\n\nAppellee called the juror,  witnesses and attorney alleged to\n\nhave  engaged  in the  misconduct to  testify.   All  of them\n\ndenied that the conversation had ever occurred.    \n\n          The juror testified that  he had been approached by\n\na  woman,   unconnected  with   the  case,  outside   of  the\n\ncourthouse, who told him that one of appellee's witnesses was\n\nfrom the  same home  town as  the juror.   The  juror stated,\n\n                             -12-\n\nhowever, that he was not influenced  by this information. Our\n\nreview of the record supports the district court's conclusion\n\nthat  sufficient  evidence  was  produced to  show  that  the\n\ncommunication did  not have a prejudicial effect.   There was\n\nno  abuse of discretion.   See United States  v. O'Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588169\"><a href=\"/opinion/588169/united-states-v-marshall-p-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Moreover, by  failing to inform the  district court\n\nabout the alleged juror misconduct until five hours after the\n\nverdict was rendered, although she had allegedly become aware\n\nof  the  impropriety  eight  hours  before  the  verdict  was\n\nentered, appellant  waived the  right to complain  about such\n\nconduct.  See United States v. Morris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593170\"><a href=\"/opinion/593170/united-states-v-howard-morris-united-states-v-rafael-tormes-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1992),  cert. denied,      U.S.    , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, appellant argues\n\nthat  the court in its opinion mischaracterized the case as a\n\n\"slip and fall\" case  and that its misconception of  the case\n\nwas reflected  in the  jury instructions.   Second, appellant\n\ncontends  that the  district court  erred in  instructing the\n\njury  regarding dismissal  of  the third-party  defendant  as\n\nfollows:\n\n                             -13-\n\n     Otis Elevator Company  is no longer  with us.   The\n     case  of Otis was disposed of in such a manner that\n     you  don't need to  concern yourself  with anything\n     pertaining to it.   Forget  about it.   Otis is  no\n     longer  a part of this case and I repeat, you don't\n     need to be concerned with it. \n\nAppellant argues  that this instruction sent a message to the\n\njury  that   the  malfunction   of  the  escalator   was  not\n\nresponsible for the accident.\n\n          The  record  indicates  that  appellant  failed  to\n\nobject to the  jury instructions before  the jury retired  to\n\nconsider  the verdict,  as required  by Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 51.\n\nRule 51 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     No  party may  assign as  error the  giving  of the\n     failure to  give an  instruction unless that  party\n     objects thereto before the jury retires to consider\n     its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected\n     to and the grounds of the objection.\n\n\"In the absence of  compliance with the dictates of  Rule 51,\n\nwe  review for plain error.\" Elgabri v. Lekas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583865\"><a href=\"/opinion/583865/tarek-h-elgabri-md-v-mary-d-lekas-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n1259 (1st Cir.  1992).   Our review of  the district  court's\n\ninstructions to the jury does not reveal any \"miscarriage  of\n\njustice.\" Id.  at 1259.  Therefore, we find no plain error in\n             \n\nthe jury instructions.\n\n          Although the  district court referred  to this case\n\nas a \"slip and fall\" case in its opinion, it did not do so in\n\nits jury  instructions.  Moreover, such a reference would not\n\nhave  constituted plain  error.    The detailed  instructions\n\ngiven  corrected any  misconception that  the term  \"slip and\n\nfall\"  might  have  conveyed.   The  court  correctly  stated\n\n                             -14-\n\ncurrent Puerto Rico  law with  respect to  negligence in  the\n\ncontext of this case.  See Mas v. United States, No. 92-1392,\n                                               \n\nslip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 1993).  Moreover, the jury\n\nfound  that appellee was negligent.  There was no plain error\n\nhere.\n\n          Appellant  fares   no  better  with   her  argument\n\nregarding  the court's  instructions about  the dismissal  of\n\nOtis  Elevator Co.   Even  assuming that  the portion  of the\n\ninstructions relating  to  the third  party defendant,  taken\n\nalone, might  have improperly directed  the jury's  attention\n\naway  from the role of the escalator in causing the accident,\n\nwhen we consider  the instructions  as a whole,  it is  clear\n\nthat no miscarriage of justice resulted. Cf. United States v.\n                                                          \n\nO'Brien, 972 at 16 (\"so long as the charge, taken as a whole,\n       \n\ncorrectly  conveys the  concept  of reasonable  doubt to  the\n\njury,  no  reversible error  exists\").    The district  court\n\ncarefully  instructed the jury  that appellee  had a  duty to\n\n\"maintain the  business place in  such a safe  condition that\n\none  who is induced to  enter the premises,  would not suffer\n\ndamage.\"    As  thus   described,  appellant's  duty  clearly\n\nextended to maintenance of the escalator.  The manufacturer's\n\ndismissal from the case  did not preclude a finding  that the\n\nescalator was not maintained in \"a safe condition.\"  \n\n          For all of the  foregoing reasons, the judgment and\n\nthe denial  of appellant's motion for  mistrial are affirmed.\n                                                            \n\n                             -15-\n\nAppellee's request for damages and costs  pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 38 is denied.                              \n                    \n\n                             -16-\n</pre>",
