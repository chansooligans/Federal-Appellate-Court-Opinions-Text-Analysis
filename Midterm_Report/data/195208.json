Walter Jay Skinner, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                     \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                 Torruella, Boudin and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                        \n\n   Francis A. Connor on brief pro se.\n                    \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per  Curiam.    Petitioner Francis  Connor  appeals  the\n                \n\ndistrict  court's  dismissal  of  his   petition  for  relief\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm.\n\n     Connor raises  two issues  in his  petition.   First, he\n\nalleges   that  the  district  court  violated  18  U.S.C.   \n\n3561(a)(3) when  it sentenced him  to a term of  probation at\n\nthe same time as it  sentenced him to a term  of imprisonment\n\nfor another offense.  See 18 U.S.C.   3561(a)(3) (sentence of\n                         \n\nprobation may not be imposed if defendant is sentenced at the\n\nsame time  to a  sentence of imprisonment  for the same  or a\n\ndifferent offense).  However, section 3561(a)(3) applies only\n\nto offenses committed after  Nov. 1, 1987.   See Pub. L.  No.\n                                                \n\n98-473,   235(a)(1), 98 Stat.  1976, 2031.  Since the offense\n\nfor which Connor was sentenced occurred in 1984, there was no\n\nerror in imposing  upon him both  a sentence of  imprisonment\n\nand one of probation.\n\n     Connor  also  asserts  that  the  Probation   Department\n\nintends,  without authority,  to  impose upon  his  probation\n\nconditions  not imposed by the sentencing court.1  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Crocker, 435 F.2d 601, 603 (8th Cir. 1971) (\"Fixing\n                 \n\nthe terms and conditions of probation is a judicial act which\n\nmay not be  delegated.\").  Even if we  assume that conditions\n\nnot   yet  imposed  upon  petitioner  are  ripe  for  review,\n\n                    \n\n1.  The conditions are that the period of probation be served\nin  Springfield, Massachusetts  and  that petitioner  refrain\nfrom working in the used car business.\n\n                             -2-\n\npetitioner  is not challenging  the legality of  the sentence\n\nimposed  by the  court  but  the  conditions  of  confinement\n\nimposed by the Probation Department.  The proper vehicle  for\n\nsuch  a petition is  28 U.S.C.    2241 not 28  U.S.C.   2255.\n\nSee United States  v. Di Russo, 535 F.2d 673  (1st Cir. 1976)\n                              \n\n(allegation that \"conditions of . . . confinement differ from\n\nwhat  the judge had  contemplated at the  time of sentencing\"\n\ncognizable under    2241 not   2255).  Motions  pursuant to  \n\n2241, however, must be brought before  a district court which\n\nhas jurisdiction over  the prisoner or his  custodian. United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Glantz, 884 F.2d  1483, 1489 (1st Cir. 1989), cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 1086 (1990). Thus, even if the petition were\n      \n\ntreated as one pursuant to   2241, the district court for the\n\nDistrict  of   Massachusetts  was  without   jurisdiction  to\n\nentertain   it   since   petitioner   was   incarcerated   in\n\nPennsylvania at the time the petition was brought.  See id. \n                                                          \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -3-\n",
