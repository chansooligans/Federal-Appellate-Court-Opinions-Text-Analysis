María D. Peñalbert-Rosa was\n\ndischarged from public employment in Puerto Rico in February 2009,\n\nshortly after the governorship of the Commonwealth changed hands\n\nfrom one political party to another.                    According to her later\n\ncomplaint, Peñalbert had been employed since 2006 as a receptionist\n\nin   an   office    building   annexed     to     the   Puerto    Rico   governor's\n\nexecutive     mansion;     from    1989      to    2006,    she     worked   in    a\n\ncommunications office within the same complex.                   Neither position,\n\nshe asserts, entailed formulating policy or handling confidential\n\ninformation.\n\n            The new governor, Luis Fortuño-Burset, candidate of the\n\nNew Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), was elected in November 2008 and\n\nassumed office in January 2009.           Several weeks later, Peñalbert--a\n\nmember of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\")--received a letter\n\nterminating her employment.        The letter described her position as\n\n\"one of trust\" (that is, one subject to at-will termination under\n\nPuerto Rico law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1465 (2006); see Costa-\n\nUrena v. Segarra, 590 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2009)), but it\n\ncontained no criticism of her work or explanation for her firing.\n\n            On April 16, 2009, Peñalbert brought the present civil\n\nrights    action,    42   U.S.C.   §   1983       (2006),   alleging      that    the\n\ntermination violated her federal constitutional rights to freedom\n\nof speech and association, due process, and equal protection; she\n\nalso invoked supplemental federal jurisdiction over various claims\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\farising under Puerto Rico law.           The complaint named as defendants\n\nGovernor Fortuño; Fortuño's chief of staff, Juan Carlos Blanco; and\n\nthe administrator of the governor's mansion, Velmarie Berlingeri-\n\nMarín--each in his or her individual and official capacities.\n\n            The central claim was that Fortuño and the two others\n\nfired Peñalbert because of her political affiliation to the PDP and\n\ngave her position to an NPP member.                 The complaint sought $1.5\n\nmillion in compensatory damages as well as preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief, which was denied. Ultimately, the district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint for failure to state a claim under federal law, Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.   P.    12(b)(6);     the   claims   under   Puerto    Rico   law   were\n\ndismissed without prejudice.\n\n            Peñalbert now appeals, focusing only on the political\n\ndiscrimination claim under the First Amendment and the denial of\n\npreliminary injunctive relief; she also says her local law claims\n\nshould not have been dismissed with prejudice, but the district\n\ncourt dismissed them without prejudice.              Our review of a judgment\n\nof dismissal for failure to state a claim under the federal statute\n\nis de novo, Morales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 524 F.3d 15,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 2008), accepting the well-pleaded allegations of the\n\ncomplaint    as    true   and    drawing      all   reasonable   inferences     in\n\nPeñalbert's favor, Otero v. P.R. Indus. Comm'n, 441 F.3d 18, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f          As construed by several path-breaking decisions, the\n\nFirst Amendment prohibits government officials from taking adverse\n\nemployment    actions    against    public    employees    because   of   the\n\nemployees' political affiliations, unless partisan considerations\n\nare a legitimate requirement for the position in question.            Branti\n\nv. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 516-18 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.\n\n347, 372-73 (1976) (plurality opinion).            Subject to the latter\n\nexception, the plaintiff meets the test by showing that political\n\naffiliation    was   a   substantial    or    motivating    factor   in   the\n\nemployment decision. Montfort-Rodríguez v. Rey-Hernández, 504 F.3d\n\n221, 224-25 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The complaint adequately alleges a claim that someone\n\ndischarged    Peñalbert    in    violation    of   the    First   Amendment.\n\nPresumably, whoever discharged her was acting as a state actor, and\n\nno basis has yet been asserted for exempting Peñalbert from the\n\nprotections of Branti and Elrod.           While there may have been some\n\nreason independent of political party for the firing, the opposite\n\ninference may be drawn from the timing of the discharge, the lack\n\nof explanation and the replacement by a member of the opposing\n\nparty.\n\n          The trouble with Peñalbert's complaint is not that the\n\ncharge is implausible; political firings after elections in Puerto\n\nRico are not uncommon.          But, save under special conditions, an\n\nadequate complaint must include not only a plausible claim but also\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fa plausible defendant.            Yet there is nothing in the complaint\n\nbeyond   raw    speculation       to    suggest      that       the    named   defendants\n\nparticipated--either         as     perpetrators           or    accomplices--in        the\n\ndecision to dismiss Peñalbert.\n\n            To be sure, the complaint asserts that Governor Fortuño\n\n\"approves      or   disapproves        of   all     personnel         decisions   [at   the\n\ngovernor's mansion], including the personnel decisions concerning\n\nthe termination of [Peñalbert]\"; that the two named subordinate\n\nofficials \"participated\" in these decisions; that the defendants\n\n\"knew or assumed\" that Peñalbert belonged to the PDP \"and/or\" was\n\nnot a member of the NPP; and ultimately that all three conspired to\n\ndismiss Peñalbert because she was a member of the PDP.                         All except\n\nthat conspiracy charge are at least couched in factual terms.1\n\n            The       plaintiff's      factual       allegations         are   ordinarily\n\nassumed to be true in passing on the adequacy of the complaint,\n\nwhich need not plead evidence.               See, e.g., Sepúlveda-Villarini v.\n\nDep't of Educ., Nos. 08-2283, 09-1801, 2010 WL 5093220, at *4 (1st\n\nCir. Dec. 10, 2010); Sandler v. E. Airlines, Inc., 649 F.2d 19, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1981) (per curiam).                  But \"ordinarily\" does not mean\n\n\"always\":      some    allegations,         while    not    stating      ultimate   legal\n\nconclusions, are nevertheless so threadbare or speculative that\n\n\n     1\n      The legal charge of conspiracy standing alone is inadequate.\nDM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 55\n(1st Cir. 1999) (alleged antitrust conspiracy). See generally 5B\nC. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at\n521 n.22 (3d ed. 2004) (collecting copious cases).\n\n                                            -5-\n\fthey fail to cross \"the line between the conclusory and the\n\nfactual.\"    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 n.5\n\n(2007).\n\n            Thus, in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), the\n\ncomplaint   charged   that   two   high-ranking   government   officials\n\nknowingly condoned harsh detention conditions for the plaintiff \"as\n\na matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race,\n\nand/or national origin,\" id. at 1944 (quoting complaint). Although\n\nthis was patently a factual claim about the named defendants' state\n\nof mind, the Supreme Court held that the bare allegation of intent\n\nwas inadequate absent more specific factual assertions:\n\n            To be clear, we do not reject these bald\n            allegations on the ground that they are\n            unrealistic or nonsensical.     We do not so\n            characterize them any more than the Court in\n            Twombly rejected the plaintiffs' express\n            allegation of \"'a contract, combination or\n            conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,'\"\n            because it thought that claim too chimerical\n            to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature\n            of respondent's allegations, rather than their\n            extravagantly     fanciful    nature,     that\n            disentitles them to the presumption of truth.\n\nId. at 1951 (internal citation omitted).\n\n            Iqbal could be viewed as emergent law, see, e.g., 129 S.\n\nCt. at 1961 (Souter, J., dissenting), but we ourselves had earlier\n\nsaid a complaint that rests on \"bald assertions\" and \"unsupportable\n\nconclusions\" may be subject to dismissal, Aulson v. Blanchard, 83\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996); and our decisions since Iqbal have\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fseveral times found unadorned factual assertions to be inadequate.2\n\nWithout trying to lay down a mechanical rule, it is enough to say\n\nthat sometimes a threadbare factual allegation bears insignia of\n\nits speculative character and, absent greater concreteness, invites\n\nan    early    challenge--which      can    be    countered    by    a   plaintiff's\n\nsupplying of the missing detail.\n\n              Here, Peñalbert's complaint does allege that personnel\n\ndecisions in the executive mansion are within the authority of the\n\ngovernor, but nothing beyond speculation supports the further\n\nassertion that the governor or his chief of staff participated in\n\nthe    decision    to   dismiss   Peñalbert.         Someone    denominated       the\n\n\"administrator\" of the governor's mansion might more plausibly be\n\ninvolved,       but     nothing      in    the     complaint        indicates     the\n\nadministrator’s actual duties or that the administrator ordinarily\n\npasses on the selection or discharge of a receptionist.\n\n              A defendant could be liable, even without knowing of\n\nPeñalbert or her position, if (for example) on some generic basis\n\nthat       defendant    authorized    the       impermissible       firing   of   PDP\n\nsupporters because of their party membership or beliefs.                          Cf.\n\n\n\n       2\n      See Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 49 (1st Cir.\n2009) (insufficiency, based on Iqbal, of conclusory assertion that\nprison administrators failed to supervise lower-level officials\nwith \"deliberate indifference and/or reckless disregard\" to\nplaintiff's rights); Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 274 (1st\nCir. 2009) (insufficiency, based on Iqbal, of bare allegation that\ndefendant mayor had \"personally participated\" in raids to corral\nand kill household pets in a public housing complex).\n\n                                          -7-\n\fFigueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(discussing alleged statement by mayor of his \"intention to rid\n\nCity Hall of NPP employees\").      But, again, mere possibility is not\n\nenough to state a claim and again no facts are stated in the\n\ncomplaint to show that in this instance any of the three gave such\n\nan order or that it is even plausible that they did.\n\n           If   Peñalbert    had   any    basis   beyond    speculation    for\n\ncharging any one of the named defendants with knowing participation\n\nin the wrong, it seems almost certain that this would have been\n\nmentioned--if not in the complaint at least in the opposition to\n\nthe motion to dismiss.       Specific information, even if not in the\n\nform of admissible evidence, would likely be enough at this stage;\n\npure speculation is not.       This may seem hard on a plaintiff who\n\nmerely suspects wrongdoing, but even discovery requires a minimum\n\nshowing and \"fishing expeditions\" are not permitted.             DM Research,\n\n170 F.3d at 55.\n\n           However,    Peñalbert's       position    is     in   one   respect\n\ndifferent: the complaint adequately alleges--based on the non-\n\nconclusory facts already listed--that someone fired Peñalbert based\n\non party membership.       Of course, the factual allegations might be\n\nlater   undermined    or   countered     by   affirmative   defenses,    e.g.,\n\nCepero-Rivera v. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 132-33 (1st Cir. 2005); but\n\nat this stage the complaint adequately asserts a federal wrong by\n\nsomeone.   So while the present complaint does not justify suit\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fagainst the defendants actually named, an avenue for discovery may\n\nbe open.\n\n           A plaintiff who is unaware of the identity of the person\n\nwho   wronged   her   can   sometimes   proceed   against   a   \"John   Doe\"\n\ndefendant as a placeholder.        E.g., Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1943;\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403\n\nU.S. 388, 390 n.2 (1971); see also 5A Wright & Miller, supra note\n\n1, § 1321, at 382 & n.6.3      We have previously condoned the device,\n\nat least when discovery is likely to reveal the identity of the\n\ncorrect defendant and good faith investigative efforts to do so\n\nhave already failed.        See Martínez-Rivera v. Sánchez Ramos, 498\n\nF.3d 3, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           Whether Peñalbert could make such a showing is not clear\n\nfrom the face of her complaint, and she has not sought this \"John\n\nDoe\" alternative.     Rarely do we rescue a civil claim--even to the\n\nvery limited extent now contemplated--on grounds not urged either\n\non the district court or on us.            But Twombly and Iqbal are\n\nrelatively recent; developing a workable distinction between \"fact\"\n\nand \"speculation\" is still a work in progress; and while upholding\n\n\n\n      3\n      By coincidence, two \"John Doe\" allegations appear in the\npresent complaint; the plaintiff did not know the names of two\nspouses of named defendants--often included in Puerto Rico cases\nfor reasons that need not concern us--and so included them as \"Juan\nDoe\" and \"Juanita Doe.\" However, these are merely pseudonyms for\ntwo specific persons whose liability, if any, is derivative, and\nthey are not a substitute for a \"John Doe\" claim against an unknown\nperpetrator.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthe dismissal of the complaint against the named defendants, we\n\nthink that the interests of justice warrant a remand to give\n\nPeñalbert a reasonable opportunity to move to amend the complaint\n\nto seek relief against a \"John Doe\" defendant. See Rivera-Gomez v.\n\nde Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 636 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          Peñalbert   has   also    appealed   from   the   denial   of   a\n\npreliminary injunction--a determination ordinarily reviewed only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    See, e.g., Naser Jewelers, Inc. v. City\n\nof Concord, 513 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2008).            Given that the\n\npresent complaint is inadequate to show liability on the part of\n\nany named defendant, the denial of the preliminary injunction can\n\nhardly be deemed error.     If on remand Peñalbert is allowed to\n\nproceed on a \"John Doe\" basis, she is free to renew her motion for\n\npreliminary relief; whether such relief would be warranted at that\n\nstage, and against whom, are matters not now before us.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint as\n\nto the named defendants and the denial of preliminary relief, but\n\nwe remand the case to allow Peñalbert to move promptly to add a\n\n\"John Doe\" defendant.   Each side shall bear its own costs on this\n\nappeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

The complaint named as defendants\n\nGovernor Fortuño; Fortuño's chief of staff, Juan Carlos Blanco; and\n\nthe administrator of the governor's mansion, Velmarie Berlingeri-\n\nMarín--each in his or her individual and official capacities.\n\n            The central claim was that Fortuño and the two others\n\nfired Peñalbert because of her political affiliation to the PDP and\n\ngave her position to an NPP member.                 The complaint sought $1.5\n\nmillion in compensatory damages as well as preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief, which was denied. Ultimately, the district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint for failure to state a claim under federal law, Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.

While there may have been some\n\nreason independent of political party for the firing, the opposite\n\ninference may be drawn from the timing of the discharge, the lack\n\nof explanation and the replacement by a member of the opposing\n\nparty.\n\n          The trouble with Peñalbert's complaint is not that the\n\ncharge is implausible; political firings after elections in Puerto\n\nRico are not uncommon.          But, save under special conditions, an\n\nadequate complaint must include not only a plausible claim but also\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fa plausible defendant.            Yet there is nothing in the complaint\n\nbeyond   raw    speculation       to    suggest      that       the    named   defendants\n\nparticipated--either         as     perpetrators           or    accomplices--in        the\n\ndecision to dismiss Peñalbert.\n\n            To be sure, the complaint asserts that Governor Fortuño\n\n\"approves      or   disapproves        of   all     personnel         decisions   [at   the\n\ngovernor's mansion], including the personnel decisions concerning\n\nthe termination of [Peñalbert]\"; that the two named subordinate\n\nofficials \"participated\" in these decisions; that the defendants\n\n\"knew or assumed\" that Peñalbert belonged to the PDP \"and/or\" was\n\nnot a member of the NPP; and ultimately that all three conspired to\n\ndismiss Peñalbert because she was a member of the PDP.                         All except\n\nthat conspiracy charge are at least couched in factual terms.1\n\n            The       plaintiff's      factual       allegations         are   ordinarily\n\nassumed to be true in passing on the adequacy of the complaint,\n\nwhich need not plead evidence.

Although\n\nthis was patently a factual claim about the named defendants' state\n\nof mind, the Supreme Court held that the bare allegation of intent\n\nwas inadequate absent more specific factual assertions:\n\n            To be clear, we do not reject these bald\n            allegations on the ground that they are\n            unrealistic or nonsensical.

Someone    denominated       the\n\n\"administrator\" of the governor's mansion might more plausibly be\n\ninvolved,       but     nothing      in    the     complaint        indicates     the\n\nadministrator’s actual duties or that the administrator ordinarily\n\npasses on the selection or discharge of a receptionist.\n\n              A defendant could be liable, even without knowing of\n\nPeñalbert or her position, if (for example) on some generic basis\n\nthat       defendant    authorized    the       impermissible       firing   of   PDP\n\nsupporters because of their party membership or beliefs.

But, again, mere possibility is not\n\nenough to state a claim and again no facts are stated in the\n\ncomplaint to show that in this instance any of the three gave such\n\nan order or that it is even plausible that they did.\n\n           If   Peñalbert    had   any    basis   beyond    speculation    for\n\ncharging any one of the named defendants with knowing participation\n\nin the wrong, it seems almost certain that this would have been\n\nmentioned--if not in the complaint at least in the opposition to\n\nthe motion to dismiss.       Specific information, even if not in the\n\nform of admissible evidence, would likely be enough at this stage;\n\npure speculation is not.       This may seem hard on a plaintiff who\n\nmerely suspects wrongdoing, but even discovery requires a minimum\n\nshowing and \"fishing expeditions\" are not permitted.             DM Research,\n\n170 F.3d at 55.\n\n           However,    Peñalbert's       position    is     in   one   respect\n\ndifferent: the complaint adequately alleges--based on the non-\n\nconclusory facts already listed--that someone fired Peñalbert based\n\non party membership.       Of course, the factual allegations might be\n\nlater   undermined    or   countered     by   affirmative   defenses,    e.g.,\n\nCepero-Rivera v.

Rarely do we rescue a civil claim--even to the\n\nvery limited extent now contemplated--on grounds not urged either\n\non the district court or on us.            But Twombly and Iqbal are\n\nrelatively recent; developing a workable distinction between \"fact\"\n\nand \"speculation\" is still a work in progress; and while upholding\n\n\n\n      3\n      By coincidence, two \"John Doe\" allegations appear in the\npresent complaint; the plaintiff did not know the names of two\nspouses of named defendants--often included in Puerto Rico cases\nfor reasons that need not concern us--and so included them as \"Juan\nDoe\" and \"Juanita Doe.\" However, these are merely pseudonyms for\ntwo specific persons whose liability, if any, is derivative, and\nthey are not a substitute for a \"John Doe\" claim against an unknown\nperpetrator.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthe dismissal of the complaint against the named defendants, we\n\nthink that the interests of justice warrant a remand to give\n\nPeñalbert a reasonable opportunity to move to amend the complaint\n\nto seek relief against a \"John Doe\" defendant. See Rivera-Gomez v.\n\nde Castro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504001\"><a href=\"/opinion/504001/martin-rivera-gomez-v-rafael-adolfo-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          Peñalbert   has   also    appealed   from   the   denial   of   a\n\npreliminary injunction--a determination ordinarily reviewed only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    See, e.g., Naser Jewelers, Inc. v.

Given that the\n\npresent complaint is inadequate to show liability on the part of\n\nany named defendant, the denial of the preliminary injunction can\n\nhardly be deemed error.     If on remand Peñalbert is allowed to\n\nproceed on a \"John Doe\" basis, she is free to renew her motion for\n\npreliminary relief; whether such relief would be warranted at that\n\nstage, and against whom, are matters not now before us.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint as\n\nto the named defendants and the denial of preliminary relief, but\n\nwe remand the case to allow Peñalbert to move promptly to add a\n\n\"John Doe\" defendant.
