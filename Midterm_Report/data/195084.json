This  appeal  conveys   two\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\ninvitations.     First,  it  invites  us  to  exercise  appellate\n\njurisdiction  in connection with rulings on motions invoking Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P.  35(b).1  Second, it  invites us to  require district\n\ncourts,  in  passing  upon  such  motions,  to  hold  evidentiary\n\nhearings on demand.  We  accept the first invitation, but decline\n\nthe second.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          A jury found defendant-appellant Willie McAndrews, also\n\nknown  as  Willie  Wilson,  guilty  of  violating  21  U.S.C.    \n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.   Using the 1989 edition of the\n\nfederal  sentencing  guidelines,  the  district  court  sentenced\n\nappellant to 125 months in prison.\n\n          In  the aftermath of his sentence, appellant cooperated\n\nwith federal authorities.   Consequently, the government  filed a\n\ntimely sentence  reduction motion  under Rule  35(b).   Appellant\n\n                    \n\n     1The  rule was  rewritten as part  of the  Sentencing Reform\nAct, effective November 1, 1987, and was further amended in 1991.\nSee Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  35 advisory  committee's notes.   In  its\n   \ncurrent incarnation, the rule provides in pertinent part:\n\n          The court,  on motion of the  Government made\n          within one year  after the imposition  of the\n          sentence, may reduce a sentence  to reflect a\n          defendant's      subsequent,      substantial\n          assistance    in    the    investigation   or\n          prosecution   of  another   person  who   has\n          committed an  offense .  . .  .   The court's\n          authority  to  reduce a  sentence  under this\n          subsection includes  the authority  to reduce\n          such   sentence  to   a   level  below   that\n          established by statute as a minimum sentence.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 35(b).\n\n                                2\n\nrequested  an evidentiary  hearing on  the motion.   Following  a\n\nlengthy  continuance   designed  to  permit  a   better  informed\n\nassessment of the fruits of appellant's cooperation, the district\n\ncourt eschewed an evidentiary hearing and, acting on the parties'\n\nwritten   submissions,    granted   the    government's   motion.\n\nDissatisfied with the extent of  the reduction   the court sliced\n\n29 months from the sentence    McAndrews appeals.  We affirm.\n\nII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          We deal first with the jurisdictional quandary.  It has\n\ntwo aspects.  We treat them sequentially.\n\n                    A.  The Departure Analogy.\n                                             \n\n          It is settled  that a criminal defendant  cannot ground\n\nan appeal on the sentencing court's discretionary decision not to\n\ndepart below the guideline  sentencing range.  See, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 224  (1992); United States  v. Hilton,  946 F.2d 955,  957\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); United  States v. Romolo,  937 F.2d 20, 22  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1991).2    In  the  same  vein,  if  the  sentencing  court\n\naffirmatively  exercises its discretion  and departs downward, no\n\nappeal will  lie on behalf  of the  benefitted defendant  \"merely\n\nbecause  [he]  is  dissatisfied with  the  quantification  of the\n\n                    \n\n     2An exception  applies  when the  sentencing court's  ruling\nresults from a  mistake of law.   See, e.g., Amparo, 961  F.2d at\n                                                   \n292; Hilton, 946  F.2d at 957. Thus,  \"appellate jurisdiction may\n           \nattach when  it appears that  the failure to depart  stemmed from\nthe sentencing  court's mistaken  impression that  it lacked  the\nlegal  authority  to  depart  or,  relatedly,  from  the  court's\nmisapprehension of the rules governing departure.\"  United States\n                                                                 \nv.  Mariano, 983  F.2d  1150, 1153  (1st  Cir. 1993)  (collecting\n           \ncases).\n\n                                3\n\ncourt's generosity.\"   United States  v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d  3, 4\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).  Phrased another way, the court of appeals lacks\n\njurisdiction  to  hear an  appeal  by a  party  in whose  favor a\n\ndeparture decision operates.  See United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d\n                                                         \n\n456, 464  (1st Cir.  1993); United States  v. Gregorio,  956 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n341, 345 n.5 (1st Cir. 1992); Pighetti, 898 F.2d at 4.\n                                      \n\n          The general rule  that departure decisions of  the type\n\ndiscussed  above  are  nonappealable holds  true  in  the special\n\nsituation  of  downward departures  for  substantial assistance.3\n\nThus, neither  a district court's  refusal to depart  downward to\n\nreward  a  defendant's substantial  assistance,  nor  the court's\n\nrefusal  to  grant as  generous  a  departure  as  a  cooperating\n\ndefendant  had  hoped,  will  normally  constitute  an appealable\n\nevent.   See  United States v.  Doe, 996  F.2d 606, 607  (2d Cir.\n                                   \n\n1993);  United States  v. Correa,  995  F.2d 686,  687 (7th  Cir.\n                                \n\n1993); United  States v.  Womack, 985 F.2d  395, 401  (8th Cir.),\n                                \n\ncert. denied,  114 S. Ct.  276 (1993); United States  v. Mariano,\n                                                                \n\n983 F.2d 1150, 1153-54 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          In  this appeal, the  government attempts  to analogize\n\nsuch \"substantial  assistance\" departures to  sentence reductions\n\n                    \n\n     3Beyond  inviting   a  comparison  between   the  triggering\nmechanisms, compare U.S.S.G.    5K1.1 with  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0,  it\n                                          \nwould be supererogatory for us to rehearse today  the differences\nbetween \"substantial  assistance\" and  \"mitigating circumstances\"\ndepartures.  At any  rate, we have charted that  terrain in other\ncases.  See, e.g., United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1154-\n                                           \n55 (1st Cir. 1993); Romolo, 937 F.2d at 24-25.\n                          \n\n                                4\n\nunder Rule 35(b)  for jurisdictional purposes.4   The analogy has\n\na certain superficial attraction  because both mechanisms operate\n\nto  bring a defendant's  sentence below the  guideline sentencing\n\nrange  and  entail  similar  judicial inquiries,  compare,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nMariano,  983  F.2d  at  1156  (discussing   factors  influencing\n       \n\ndepartures under U.S.S.G.    5K1.1) with, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nMilken, 1992  U.S. Dist. LEXIS  11670 at *3-*5 (S.D.N.Y.  Aug. 5,\n      \n\n1992)  (discussing   factors  influencing  Rule   35(b)  sentence\n\nreductions).   But  on closer  perscrutation,  the analogy  fails\n\nbecause  it overlooks  a jurisdictionally  significant difference\n\nbetween downward departures and sentence reductions.\n\n          The  right  of appeal  in  criminal cases  is  purely a\n\ncreature of statute, that is, a party \"must come within the terms\n\nof  [some] applicable  statute\" in  order  to appeal.   Abney  v.\n                                                             \n\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 651, 656 (1977).   Prior to the advent of\n             \n\nguideline  sentencing, a  criminal  defendant,  in theory,  could\n\neasily achieve this benchmark.   After all, the courts of appeals\n\nhave jurisdiction  over \"appeals from all final  decisions of the\n\ndistrict courts,\" 28 U.S.C.   1291; and, in  a criminal case, the\n\nimposition  of sentence constitutes  a final decision  within the\n\nmeaning of section 1291, see Parr v. United States, 351 U.S. 513,\n                                                  \n\n518 (1956); Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 211, 212-13 (1937).\n                                   \n\nNevertheless,  the theoretical possibility  of an appeal  had few\n\n                    \n\n     4Although  this  analogy  has  never before  been  carefully\nprobed  by a  federal appellate  court, it  appears to  have been\nimplicitly approved  in a  dictum contained  in United  States v.\n                                                              \nYesil, 991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir. 1992).\n     \n\n                                5\n\npractical  consequences; since  judges  possessed extremely  wide\n\ndiscretion and  were not required  to state reasons  for imposing\n\nparticular punishments, sentences were virtually unreviewable (so\n\nlong as  they  fell within  applicable  statutory limits).    See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Ruiz-Garcia,  886 F.2d 474,  476-77 &amp;  n.4 (1st\n                             \n\nCir.  1989)  (discussing  historical   background  of  sentencing\n\nappeals). \n\n          Congress changed the calculus radically when it enacted\n\n18 U.S.C.    3742 as part of  the Sentencing Reform Act  of 1984,\n\nconstituting it as the exclusive avenue through which a party can\n\nappeal a sentence in a criminal case.5  The  statute alters prior\n\npractice   in  two  salient  respects,  narrowing  the  types  of\n\nsentences that  can be appealed  while simultaneously  augmenting\n\nthe grounds for appealing the remaining types of sentences.  See,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     5The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          A  defendant may file  a notice of  appeal in\n          the district court for review of an otherwise\n          final sentence if the sentence  \n\n               (1)  was  imposed in  violation  of\n               law;\n               (2) was  imposed as a  result of an\n               incorrect   application    of   the\n               sentencing guidelines; or \n               (3)  is greater  than the  sentence\n               specified    in   the    applicable\n               guideline range . . . or\n               (4) was imposed for an offense  for\n               which   there   is   no  sentencing\n               guideline     and     is    plainly\n               unreasonable.\n\n18 U.S.C.   3742(a) (1988).  The terms under which the government\nmay appeal a  sentence are substantially similar.   See id.  at  \n                                                           \n3742(b).\n\n                                6\n\ne.g., S.  Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1983), reprinted in\n                                                                 \n\n1984  U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3338 (stating that \"section 3742 creates\n\nfor the first time a  comprehensive system of review of sentences\n\nthat  permits the appellate  process to focus  attention on those\n\nsentences  whose review  is  crucial to  the  functioning of  the\n\nsentencing guidelines system, while also providing adequate means\n\nfor correction of erroneous and clearly unreasonable sentences\").\n\n          In the post-guidelines era,  then, only sentences  that\n\nmeet  the  criteria  limned  in  section  3742  are  amenable  to\n\nappellate review.   And  because neither  refusals to  depart nor\n\ndownward  departures result  in  a  sentence  \"greater  than  the\n\nsentence  specified in the applicable guideline range,\" 18 U.S.C.\n\n  3742(a)(3),  or otherwise  trigger the  prophylaxis of  section\n\n3742(a), a defendant  ordinarily will not be able  to appeal from\n\nsuch a decision, see Pighetti, 898 F.2d at 4.6\n                             \n\n          Rule  35(b)  is  a  horse  of  a  different  hue.    By\n\ndefinition, a sentence must already have been imposed before Rule\n\n35(b) can be  invoked and a sentence reduction  contemplated.  It\n\nfollows that the appealability of an order resolving a Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion  is not  controlled by  18 U.S.C.    3742 because  such an\n\norder   is  not,  properly   speaking,  a  sentence.7     Rather,\n\n                    \n\n     6This  statement is,  of course,  subject  to the  exception\npreviously mentioned.   See supra note 2.   We see no  reason why\n                                 \nthe same exception should not apply if, and to the extent that, a\nmistake  of law materially and demonstrably influences the extent\nof a departure decision.\n\n     7On  this point,  we differ  from  the position  adumbrated,\nwithout analysis, in United States  v. Yesil, 991 F.2d 1527, 1531\n                                            \nn.4 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                7\n\nappealability  in  such  circumstances, like  appealability  with\n\nrespect to the  disposition of virtually all  other post-judgment\n\nmotions, is governed by 28 U.S.C.   1291.  And an order resolving\n\na  Rule 35(b) motion  satisfies the preconditions  established by\n\nsection 1291, for entry of the order leaves nothing further to be\n\ndone.  See  United States v. Metropolitan Dist.  Comm'n, 847 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n12, 14 (1st Cir. 1988)  (elucidating \"general rule\" that an order\n\nbecomes final  and appealable when  a court resolves  a contested\n\nmatter, leaving nothing further to be done) (citing, inter  alia,\n                                                                \n\nCatlin v.  United States, 324  U.S. 229,  233 (1945)).   An order\n                        \n\ngranting  or  denying a  Rule  35(b)  motion  is, thus,  a  final\n\ndecision for purposes of section 1291.\n\n          Cast  in this  mold,  our  analysis  accords  with  the\n\ngeneral  principle, taken  for granted  in both our  criminal and\n\ncivil jurisprudence, that rulings disposing of motions which seek\n\nto alter preexisting judgments are appealable.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Slade, 980 F.2d  27, 32 (1st Cir.  1992) (entertaining\n                \n\nappeal  from  denial  of  post-judgment  motion  to  present  new\n\nevidence pursuant  to Fed. R.  Crim. P. 33); Fiore  v. Washington\n                                                                 \n\nCty.

Distasio,\n                                                                \n\n820  F.2d 20,  22-24 (1st  Cir.  1987) (entertaining  appeal from\n\ngrant of sentence reduction motion  under former Rule 35(b)); see\n                                                                 \n\n                                8\n\nalso cases cited infra p.12 (entertaining appeals from denials of\n                                                              \n\nsentence  reduction  motions  brought  pursuant  to  former  Rule\n\n35(b)).\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, the  government's attempted\n\nanalogy between  downward departures  for substantial  assistance\n\nand  sentence  reductions  is  unpersuasive  in  connection  with\n\nappellate jurisdiction.    We  conclude  that,  even  in  an  era\n\ndominated  by the  sentencing guidelines,  an  order granting  or\n\ndenying a timely motion for a sentence reduction, unlike  certain\n\nanalogous departure decisions, remains appealable.\n\n                     B.  Lack of Adverseness.\n                     B.  Lack of Adverseness\n                                            \n\n          Perhaps   the   better   argument   against   appellate\n\njurisdiction in the  case of a granted Rule 35(b)  motion is that\n\nthe defendant, qua appellant, lacks \"such a personal stake in the\n                  \n\noutcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness\n\nwhich sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so\n\nlargely depends.\"  Baker v. Carr,  369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962).   At\n                                \n\nleast  in certain circumstances, a prevailing party cannot appeal\n\nfrom an order or judgment entered in his favor.  See  Sierra Club\n                                                                 \n\nv. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 213  (1st Cir. 1990); In re Public  Serv.\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 898 F.2d  1, 2  (1st Cir.  1990); Bath Iron  Works Corp.  v.\n                                                             \n\nCoulombe, 888  F.2d 179, 180  (1st Cir.  1989).   And, here,  the\n        \n\nlower  court's order operated  in appellant's favor,  trimming 29\n\nmonths  from  his  sentence.   It  is,  therefore, arguable  that\n\nappellant,  having derived a  substantial benefit, should  not be\n\nallowed to appeal from the ruling.\n\n                                9\n\n          The problem with  such an argument is  twofold.  First,\n\nit is overly simplistic.  The key to the appealability of a final\n\norder is  injury,  not  prevailing party  status.    See  Deposit\n                                                                 \n\nGuaranty Nat'l Bk. v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 334 (1980) (explaining\n                           \n\nthat \"appeal may be  permitted from an adverse ruling  collateral\n\nto the  judgment on the merits at the behest of the party who has\n\nprevailed on the merits, so long as that party retains a stake in\n\nthe  appeal  satisfying  the  requirements  of  Art.  III\").    A\n\nprevailing party dissatisfied with the quantum of relief obtained\n\n   say, a  personal  injury plaintiff  who  receives a  favorable\n\nliability finding but a paltry damage award   ordinarily can seek\n\nappellate review.8  So it is here.\n\n          Second, this court  has already repudiated the  lack of\n\nadverseness   argument  in  an  almost  identical  context.    In\n\nDistasio, we considered  the case  of a  criminal defendant  who,\n        \n\nafter  having  been granted  a  reduction  in  sentence under  an\n\nearlier version of  Rule 35(b), sought to appeal  the adequacy of\n\nthe  reduction.   See  Distasio, 820  F.2d  at 22.    Although we\n                               \n\nvacated  the district  court's order  on a  different ground,  we\n\nruled squarely that \"a criminal defendant may appeal the adequacy\n\nof  sentence  reductions granted  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Crim. P.\n\n35(b).\"  Id. at  24.  The recent amendments to  Rule 35(b) do not\n            \n\n                    \n\n     8We note that, if the law  were to the contrary in the  Rule\n35(b)  environment,  a  district  court could  invariably  defeat\nappellate  oversight of an otherwise  reviewable denial of a Rule\n35(b) motion by,  for example, lopping one day  off a defendant's\nsentence.\n\n                                10\n\nundermine  the rationale  on which  Distasio rests,9  and we  are\n                                            \n\nbound  by it.   See,  e.g., Doughty  v. Underwriters  at Lloyd's,\n                                                                 \n\nLondon,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993) [No. 93-1174,  slip op.\n      \n\nat 9] (discussing binding effect of prior panel opinions within a\n\ncircuit).\n\n          We hold, therefore, that we have jurisdiction to hear a\n\ntimely  appeal in which a prevailing defendant complains that the\n\ndistrict  court acted too  grudgingly in dispensing  relief under\n\nRule 35(b).  This case fits within that jurisdictional enclave.\n\nIII.  THE MERITS\n\n          Having   ascertained   the   existence   of   appellate\n\njurisdiction, the  merits  of  the appeal  need  not  detain  us.\n\nAppellant's  flagship contention is that the district court erred\n\nin  denying his  motion  for an  evidentiary  hearing and,  thus,\n\nrobbed him of  the opportunity to make a  more formidable showing\n\non the merits.  We are not persuaded.10  \n\n                    \n\n     9The current  version of  Rule 35(b),  applicable to  crimes\ncommitted on or after November 1, 1987, differs in at least three\nways from  former Rule 35(b).   First, the  text of the  new rule\nlimits the  ground for relief  to \"substantial assistance  in the\ninvestigation  or prosecution of another person who has committed\nan offense.\"   Second,  the new rule  adds a  \"government motion\"\nrequirement.  Finally,  in the latest version of  Rule 35(b), the\nperiod within  which a Rule  35(b) motion  may be filed  has been\nlengthened somewhat.   Nonetheless, the  essence of a  Rule 35(b)\ndetermination     the  district  court's  discretionary  decision\nwhether  to reduce  a defendant's  sentence, and  if so,  to what\nextent   remains intact.\n\n     10Appellant hints, but offers  no developed argumentation to\nshow,  that the sentence reduction granted  by the district court\nis, in  fact,  too  niggardly.    That  approach  is,  therefore,\nforeclosed.   See United States  v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n                                           \nCir.) (warning that  issues adverted to in  a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied  by  developed  argumentation, are  waived),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\n                                11\n\n          In  this   endeavor,  appellant's  main  focus  is  his\n\ninsistence that  \"without conducting an evidentiary  hearing, the\n\ndistrict court cannot  possibly be in a position  to evaluate the\n\nfull  nature  and   extent  of   [a  defendant's]   cooperation.\"\n\nAppellant's  Brief  at  9.     We  flatly  reject  such  a  rigid\n\nformulation.   A criminal defendant is not automatically entitled\n\nto an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. McGill,      F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993)  [No.\n                       \n\n93-1023, slip op. at 3] (collecting cases).  \n\n          We can envision no sound basis for exempting Rule 35(b)\n\nmotions from  the sweep  of this generality.   While  gauging the\n\nextent  and value of a  defendant's assistance to the authorities\n\nis  a delicate,  highly  nuanced  matter,  we  have  consistently\n\nabjured  mandatory  evidentiary  hearings in  a  wide  variety of\n\nequally  delicate, equally nuanced situations.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Garcia,  954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st  Cir. 1992) (sentencing);\n                \n\nUnited States v.

O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810,\n                                                  \n\n817 (1st Cir. 1990) (motion for Nebbia hearing); United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSaade,   652  F.2d  1126,  1135-36  (1st  Cir.  1981)  (selective\n     \n\nprosecution).   Tellingly, motions brought under earlier versions\n\nof  Rule  35(b)  have  not been  thought  to  require evidentiary\n\nhearings, or  even oral argument.   See, e.g.,   United States v.\n                                                              \n\nDeCologero, 821  F.2d 39,  44 (1st Cir.  1987); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nHeller, 797  F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.  1986); United States v. Foss,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\ndenied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).\n      \n\n                                12\n\n501 F.2d  522, 529 (1st Cir. 1974).  We conclude, therefore, that\n\na  district court  has  broad  discretion  to  craft  appropriate\n\nprocedures  for considering  Rule  35(b)  motions, including  the\n\ndiscretion  to  grant  or  deny an  evidentiary  hearing.11   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Winfield, 960  F.2d 970, 972 (11th  Cir. 1992);\n                          \n\nUnited States  v. Collins Spencer  Catch The Bear, 727  F.2d 759,\n                                                 \n\n762 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n          Once it  is determined  that Rule  35(b) motions,  as a\n\nclass, do not demand special swaddling, appellant's assignment of\n\nerror founders.  We review  the district court's rulings granting\n\nor denying  evidentiary  hearings  under  an  abuse-of-discretion\n\nrubric.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at  19; DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44.\n                                                \n\nBecause  the trial  judge  is  steeped in  the  facts  and has  a\n\nsuperior  vantage point  for assessing  motions of this  sort, we\n\nwill not overrule the  refusal to convene an  evidentiary hearing\n\n                    \n\n     11Appellant  cites United  States v.  Yesil,  968 F.2d  1122\n                                                \n(11th Cir. 1992), for the  proposition that a district court must\nalways  grant a requested evidentiary hearing when the government\nmoves for a  sentence reduction under Rule 35(b).   The case does\nnot bear the weight that appellant ascribes to it.  In  the first\nplace, the original opinion in Yesil has been superseded, and the\n                                    \ncourt's revised opinion makes clear \"that the decision whether or\nnot  to grant  an evidentiary  hearing [on  a Rule  35(b) motion]\ngenerally is committed  to the [sentencing]  court's discretion.\"\nUnited  States v.  Yesil, 991  F.2d 1527,  1531 (11th  Cir. 1993)\n                        \n(superseding earlier opinion).  In the second place, written plea\nagreements  obligated the government in Yesil, upon completion of\n                                             \nthe  defendants'   cooperation,  to   apprise  the   court  fully\nconcerning the nature and extent  of defendants' actions.  Id. at\n                                                              \n1532.   Because of  the language of  the plea  agreements, \"[t]he\ndistrict court lost its usual discretion to determine  whether or\nnot to  grant a party's request for an  evidentiary hearing . . .\n.\"   Id.   In the case at  bar, the record does not show any plea\n        \nagreement  between the  defendant and  the  prosecution.   Hence,\nYesil is inapposite.\n     \n\n                                13\n\nabsent  a clear  showing  that the  court's  discretion has  been\n\nmisused.  Consequently, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing on\n\na   post-judgment  motion  must  carry  a  formidable  burden  of\n\npersuasion.  See McGill,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 3-4].\n                       \n\n          McAndrews wholly  failed  to carry  this heavy  burden.\n\nThe government made  a detailed written  proffer to the  district\n\ncourt, spelling out the facts referable to its sentence reduction\n\nmotion.  Appellant had a similar opportunity.  Yet, he offered no\n\nspecifics to contradict  the prosecution's proffer or  to suggest\n\nmaterial omissions.12   Beneath the rhetoric,  appellant's filing\n\nevinced  little  more  than  the  hope  that,  should  a  hearing\n\neventuate, something helpful might emerge.  But more is exigible.\n\nA  district court  need not  grant  an evidentiary  hearing on  a\n\nmotion  merely  because  a defendant's  hopes  spring  eternal or\n\nbecause a defendant  wishes to mount a fishing  expedition.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., DeCologero,  821 F.2d  at 44  (cautioning that  evidentiary\n                \n\nhearings  cannot be  provided  upon  demand, \"at  the  whim of  a\n\nsuitor\").\n\n          The short of it is  that a criminal defendant who seeks\n\nan evidentiary hearing on a motion must, at the very least, carry\n\n                    \n\n     12At one point, appellant asserted that, in  addition to the\nefforts that  the government  catalogued, he  also \"provided  the\nimpetus for  two other individuals, Charlie Luna and Pedro Gomez,\nto  commence  cooperation,\"  and that  new  cases  were developed\nbecause of this  information.  But  scrutiny of the  government's\nproffer reveals complete agreement on  this point   and, thus, no\nneed for  an evidentiary hearing.   The fact that  the government\ndid not  identify Luna and  Gomez by name,  but referred to  them\nmerely as  \"two other suspects,\"  is a distinction bereft  of any\nmeaningful difference.\n\n                                14\n\nan entry-level burden  by making \"a sufficient  threshold showing\n\nthat material facts  [are] in doubt or in dispute.\"   Panitz, 907\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1173; see also  Franks  v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56\n                                           \n\n(1978) (requiring \"substantial preliminary showing\" antecedent to\n\nevidentiary hearing); Saade, 652 F.2d at 1135 (similar).  In this\n                           \n\ninstance,  appellant offered no persuasive reason to believe that\n\ntaking testimony would    or even might    be productive.   Thus,\n\nthe district court, in refusing  to grant an evidentiary hearing,\n\ndid not abuse its considerable discretion.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.     We  hold  that  we  have\n\njurisdiction  to   consider  appellant's   complaint  anent   the\n\ndisposition of  his  Rule 35(b)  motion.   Having exercised  this\n\njurisdiction, however, we find  no error in the district  court's\n\norder or in the procedure it employed.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                15\n",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury found defendant-appellant Willie McAndrews, also known as Willie Wilson, guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846.  Using the 1989 edition of the federal sentencing guidelines, the district court sentenced appellant to 125 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of his sentence, appellant cooperated with federal authorities.  Consequently, the government filed a timely sentence reduction motion under Rule 35(b).  Appellant requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  Following a lengthy continuance designed to permit a better informed assessment of the fruits of appellant's cooperation, the district court eschewed an evidentiary hearing and, acting on the parties' written submissions, granted the government's motion.  Dissatisfied with the extent of the reduction--the court sliced 29 months from the sentence--McAndrews appeals.  We affirm.II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the jurisdictional quandary.  It has two aspects.  We treat them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A. The Departure Analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on the sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.  See, e.g., United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 224, 121 L.Ed.2d 161 (1992);  United States v. Hilton, 946 F.2d 955, 957 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In the same vein, if the sentencing court affirmatively exercises its discretion and departs downward, no appeal will lie on behalf of the benefitted defendant \"merely because [he] is dissatisfied with the quantification of the court's generosity.\"  United States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir.1990).  Phrased another way, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal by a party in whose favor a departure decision operates.  See United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 464 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 345 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992);  Pighetti, 898 F.2d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule that departure decisions of the type discussed above are nonappealable holds true in the special situation of downward departures for substantial assistance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, neither a district court's refusal to depart downward to reward a defendant's substantial assistance, nor the court's refusal to grant as generous a departure as a cooperating defendant had hoped, will normally constitute an appealable event.  See United States v. Doe, 996 F.2d 606, 607 (2d Cir.1993);  United States v. Correa, 995 F.2d 686, 687 (7th Cir.1993);  United States v. Womack, 985 F.2d 395, 401 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 276, 126 L.Ed.2d 227 (1993);  United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1153-54 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, the government attempts to analogize such \"substantial assistance\" departures to sentence reductions under Rule 35(b) for jurisdictional purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The analogy has a certain superficial attraction because both mechanisms operate to bring a defendant's sentence below the guideline sentencing range and entail similar judicial inquiries, compare, e.g., Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1156 (discussing factors influencing departures under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1) with, e.g., United States v. Milken, 1992 WL 196797 at * 4, 1992 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 11670 at * 3 -* 5 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (discussing factors influencing Rule 35(b) sentence reductions).  But on closer perscrutation, the analogy fails because it overlooks a jurisdictionally significant difference between downward departures and sentence reductions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of appeal in criminal cases is purely a creature of statute, that is, a party \"must come within the terms of [some] applicable statute\" in order to appeal.  Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 656, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2038, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977).  Prior to the advent of guideline sentencing, a criminal defendant, in theory, could easily achieve this benchmark.  After all, the courts of appeals have jurisdiction over \"appeals from all final decisions of the district courts,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291;  and, in a criminal case, the imposition of sentence constitutes a final decision within the meaning of section 1291, see Parr v. United States, 351 U.S. 513, 518, 76 S.Ct. 912, 916, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956);  Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 211, 212-13, 58 S.Ct. 164, 165-66, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937).  Nevertheless, the theoretical possibility of an appeal had few practical consequences;  since judges possessed extremely wide discretion and were not required to state reasons for imposing particular punishments, sentences were virtually unreviewable (so long as they fell within applicable statutory limits).  See United States v. Ruiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d 474, 476-77 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.1989) (discussing historical background of sentencing appeals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress changed the calculus radically when it enacted 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742 as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, constituting it as the exclusive avenue through which a party can appeal a sentence in a criminal case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The statute alters prior practice in two salient respects, narrowing the types of sentences that can be appealed while simultaneously augmenting the grounds for appealing the remaining types of sentences.  See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3338 (stating that \"section 3742 creates for the first time a comprehensive system of review of sentences that permits the appellate process to focus attention on those sentences whose review is crucial to the functioning of the sentencing guidelines system, while also providing adequate means for correction of erroneous and clearly unreasonable sentences\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the post-guidelines era, then, only sentences that meet the criteria limned in section 3742 are amenable to appellate review.  And because neither refusals to depart nor downward departures result in a sentence \"greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range,\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(a)(3), or otherwise trigger the prophylaxis of section 3742(a), a defendant ordinarily will not be able to appeal from such a decision, see Pighetti, 898 F.2d at 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 35(b) is a horse of a different hue.  By definition, a sentence must already have been imposed before Rule 35(b) can be invoked and a sentence reduction contemplated.  It follows that the appealability of an order resolving a Rule 35(b) motion is not controlled by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742 because such an order is not, properly speaking, a sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Rather, appealability in such circumstances, like appealability with respect to the disposition of virtually all other post-judgment motions, is governed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  And an order resolving a Rule 35(b) motion satisfies the preconditions established by section 1291, for entry of the order leaves nothing further to be done.  See United States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1988) (elucidating \"general rule\" that an order becomes final and appealable when a court resolves a contested matter, leaving nothing further to be done) (citing, inter alia, Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633-34, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)).  An order granting or denying a Rule 35(b) motion is, thus, a final decision for purposes of section 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cast in this mold, our analysis accords with the general principle, taken for granted in both our criminal and civil jurisprudence, that rulings disposing of motions which seek to alter preexisting judgments are appealable.  See, e.g., United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 32 (1st Cir.1992) (entertaining appeal from denial of post-judgment motion to present new evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33);  Fiore v. Washington Cty. Community Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 232-33 (1st Cir.1992) (en banc) (discussing appealability of post-judgment motions in civil cases;  restating established rule that denials of post-judgment motions \"are appealable separately from the appeal of the underlying judgment\");  United States v. Distasio, 820 F.2d 20, 22-24 (1st Cir.1987) (entertaining appeal from grant of sentence reduction motion under former Rule 35(b));  see also cases cited infra p. 279 (entertaining appeals from denials of sentence reduction motions brought pursuant to former Rule 35(b)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the government's attempted analogy between downward departures for substantial assistance and sentence reductions is unpersuasive in connection with appellate jurisdiction.  We conclude that, even in an era dominated by the sentencing guidelines, an order granting or denying a timely motion for a sentence reduction, unlike certain analogous departure decisions, remains appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. Lack of Adverseness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the better argument against appellate jurisdiction in the case of a granted Rule 35(b) motion is that the defendant, qua appellant, lacks \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends.\"  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).  At least in certain circumstances, a prevailing party cannot appeal from an order or judgment entered in his favor.  See Sierra Club v. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 213 (1st Cir.1990);  In re Public Serv.  Co., 898 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1990);   Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Coulombe, 888 F.2d 179, 180 (1st Cir.1989).  And, here, the lower court's order operated in appellant's favor, trimming 29 months from his sentence.  It is, therefore, arguable that appellant, having derived a substantial benefit, should not be allowed to appeal from the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with such an argument is twofold.  First, it is overly simplistic.  The key to the appealability of a final order is injury, not prevailing party status.  See Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bk. v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 334, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 1171-72, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980) (explaining that \"appeal may be permitted from an adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the merits at the behest of the party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Art.  III\").  A prevailing party dissatisfied with the quantum of relief obtained--say, a personal injury plaintiff who receives a favorable liability finding but a paltry damage award--ordinarily can seek appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, this court has already repudiated the lack of adverseness argument in an almost identical context.  In Distasio, we considered the case of a criminal defendant who, after having been granted a reduction in sentence under an earlier version of Rule 35(b), sought to appeal the adequacy of the reduction.  See Distasio, 820 F.2d at 22.   Although we vacated the district court's order on a different ground, we ruled squarely that \"a criminal defendant may appeal the adequacy of sentence reductions granted pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).\"  Id. at 24.   The recent amendments to Rule 35(b) do not undermine the rationale on which Distasio rests,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and we are bound by it.  See, e.g., Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 6 F.3d 856, 861 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing binding effect of prior panel opinions within a circuit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that we have jurisdiction to hear a timely appeal in which a prevailing defendant complains that the district court acted too grudgingly in dispensing relief under Rule 35(b).  This case fits within that jurisdictional enclave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having ascertained the existence of appellate jurisdiction, the merits of the appeal need not detain us.  Appellant's flagship contention is that the district court erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing and, thus, robbed him of the opportunity to make a more formidable showing on the merits.  We are not persuaded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this endeavor, appellant's main focus is his insistence that \"without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court cannot possibly be in a position to evaluate the full nature and extent of [a defendant's] cooperation.\"   Appellant's Brief at 9.  We flatly reject such a rigid formulation.  A criminal defendant is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  See United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can envision no sound basis for exempting Rule 35(b) motions from the sweep of this generality.  While gauging the extent and value of a defendant's assistance to the authorities is a delicate, highly nuanced matter, we have consistently abjured mandatory evidentiary hearings in a wide variety of equally delicate, equally nuanced situations.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992) (sentencing);  United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1273-74 (1st Cir.1990) (outrageous misconduct);  United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 817 (1st Cir.1990) (motion for Nebbia hearing);  United States v. Saade, 652 F.2d 1126, 1135-36 (1st Cir.1981) (selective prosecution).  Tellingly, motions brought under earlier versions of Rule 35(b) have not been thought to require evidentiary hearings, or even oral argument.  See, e.g., United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v. Heller, 797 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1986);  United States v. Foss, 501 F.2d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1974).  We conclude, therefore, that a district court has broad discretion to craft appropriate procedures for considering Rule 35(b) motions, including the discretion to grant or deny an evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See United States v. Winfield, 960 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir.1992);  United States v. Collins Spencer Catch The Bear, 727 F.2d 759, 762 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once it is determined that Rule 35(b) motions, as a class, do not demand special swaddling, appellant's assignment of error founders.  We review the district court's rulings granting or denying evidentiary hearings under an abuse-of-discretion rubric.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 19;  DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44.   Because the trial judge is steeped in the facts and has a superior vantage point for assessing motions of this sort, we will not overrule the refusal to convene an evidentiary hearing absent a clear showing that the court's discretion has been misused.  Consequently, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing on a post-judgment motion must carry a formidable burden of persuasion.  See McGill, 11 F.3d at 225-226.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAndrews wholly failed to carry this heavy burden.  The government made a detailed written proffer to the district court, spelling out the facts referable to its sentence reduction motion.  Appellant had a similar opportunity.  Yet, he offered no specifics to contradict the prosecution's proffer or to suggest material omissions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Beneath the rhetoric, appellant's filing evinced little more than the hope that, should a hearing eventuate, something helpful might emerge.  But more is exigible.  A district court need not grant an evidentiary hearing on a motion merely because a defendant's hopes spring eternal or because a defendant wishes to mount a fishing expedition.  See, e.g., DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44 (cautioning that evidentiary hearings cannot be provided upon demand, \"at the whim of a suitor\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a criminal defendant who seeks an evidentiary hearing on a motion must, at the very least, carry an entry-level burden by making \"a sufficient threshold showing that material facts [are] in doubt or in dispute.\"  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1173;  see also Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2676-77, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) (requiring \"substantial preliminary showing\" antecedent to evidentiary hearing);  Saade, 652 F.2d at 1135 (similar).  In this instance, appellant offered no persuasive reason to believe that taking testimony would--or even might--be productive.  Thus, the district court, in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing, did not abuse its considerable discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We hold that we have jurisdiction to consider appellant's complaint anent the disposition of his Rule 35(b) motion.  Having exercised this jurisdiction, however, we find no error in the district court's order or in the procedure it employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The rule was rewritten as part of the Sentencing Reform Act, effective November 1, 1987, and was further amended in 1991.

In its current incarnation, the rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense....

Thus, \"appellate jurisdiction may attach when it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to depart or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules governing departure.\"  United States v.

First, the text of the new rule limits the ground for relief to \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"   Second, the new rule adds a \"government motion\" requirement.  Finally, in the latest version of Rule 35(b), the period within which a Rule 35(b) motion may be filed has been lengthened somewhat.

The case does not bear the weight that appellant ascribes to it.  In the first place, the original opinion in Yesil has been superseded, and the court's revised opinion makes clear \"that the decision whether or not to grant an evidentiary hearing [on a Rule 35(b) motion] generally is committed to the [sentencing] court's discretion.\"  United States v. Yesil, 991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992) (superseding earlier opinion).  In the second place, written plea agreements obligated the government in Yesil, upon completion of the defendants' cooperation, to apprise the court fully concerning the nature and extent of defendants' actions.  Id. at 1532.   Because of the language of the plea agreements, \"[t]he district court lost its usual discretion to determine whether or not to grant a party's request for an evidentiary hearing....\"  Id.

But scrutiny of the government's proffer reveals complete agreement on this point--and, thus, no need for an evidentiary hearing.

See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.

Sec. 3742(a)(3), or otherwise trigger the prophylaxis of section 3742(a), a defendant ordinarily will not be able to appeal from such a decision, see Pighetti, 898 F.2d at 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 35(b) is a horse of a different hue.  By definition, a sentence must already have been imposed before Rule 35(b) can be invoked and a sentence reduction contemplated.  It follows that the appealability of an order resolving a Rule 35(b) motion is not controlled by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742 because such an order is not, properly speaking, a sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Rather, appealability in such circumstances, like appealability with respect to the disposition of virtually all other post-judgment motions, is governed by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  And an order resolving a Rule 35(b) motion satisfies the preconditions established by section 1291, for entry of the order leaves nothing further to be done.  See United States v.

And, here, the lower court's order operated in appellant's favor, trimming 29 months from his sentence.  It is, therefore, arguable that appellant, having derived a substantial benefit, should not be allowed to appeal from the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with such an argument is twofold.  First, it is overly simplistic.  The key to the appealability of a final order is injury, not prevailing party status.  See Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bk. v. Roper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110225\"><a href=\"/opinion/110225/deposit-guaranty-nat-bank-v-roper/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 334, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110225\"><a href=\"/opinion/110225/deposit-guaranty-nat-bank-v-roper/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span> (1980) (explaining that \"appeal may be permitted from an adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the merits at the behest of the party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Art.  III\").  A prevailing party dissatisfied with the quantum of relief obtained--say, a personal injury plaintiff who receives a favorable liability finding but a paltry damage award--ordinarily can seek appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, this court has already repudiated the lack of adverseness argument in an almost identical context.  In Distasio, we considered the case of a criminal defendant who, after having been granted a reduction in sentence under an earlier version of Rule 35(b), sought to appeal the adequacy of the reduction.  See Distasio, 820 F.2d at 22.   Although we vacated the district court's order on a different ground, we ruled squarely that \"a criminal defendant may appeal the adequacy of sentence reductions granted pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).\"  Id. at 24.   The recent amendments to Rule 35(b) do not undermine the rationale on which Distasio rests,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and we are bound by it.  See, e.g., Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194981\"><a href=\"/opinion/194981/doughty-v-underwriters/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span>, 861 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing binding effect of prior panel opinions within a circuit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that we have jurisdiction to hear a timely appeal in which a prevailing defendant complains that the district court acted too grudgingly in dispensing relief under Rule 35(b).  This case fits within that jurisdictional enclave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having ascertained the existence of appellate jurisdiction, the merits of the appeal need not detain us.  Appellant's flagship contention is that the district court erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing and, thus, robbed him of the opportunity to make a more formidable showing on the merits.  We are not persuaded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this endeavor, appellant's main focus is his insistence that \"without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court cannot possibly be in a position to evaluate the full nature and extent of [a defendant's] cooperation.\"   Appellant's Brief at 9.  We flatly reject such a rigid formulation.  A criminal defendant is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can envision no sound basis for exempting Rule 35(b) motions from the sweep of this generality.  While gauging the extent and value of a defendant's assistance to the authorities is a delicate, highly nuanced matter, we have consistently abjured mandatory evidentiary hearings in a wide variety of equally delicate, equally nuanced situations.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1992) (sentencing);  United States v.

Tellingly, motions brought under earlier versions of Rule 35(b) have not been thought to require evidentiary hearings, or even oral argument.  See, e.g., United States v. DeCologero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489942\"><a href=\"/opinion/489942/united-states-v-anthony-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v.

We conclude, therefore, that a district court has broad discretion to craft appropriate procedures for considering Rule 35(b) motions, including the discretion to grant or deny an evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See United States v. Winfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580818\"><a href=\"/opinion/580818/united-states-v-nigel-winfield-nigel-winfield-v-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 972 (11th Cir.1992);  United States v.

We review the district court's rulings granting or denying evidentiary hearings under an abuse-of-discretion rubric.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 19;  DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44.   Because the trial judge is steeped in the facts and has a superior vantage point for assessing motions of this sort, we will not overrule the refusal to convene an evidentiary hearing absent a clear showing that the court's discretion has been misused.  Consequently, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing on a post-judgment motion must carry a formidable burden of persuasion.  See McGill, 11 F.3d at 225-226.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McAndrews wholly failed to carry this heavy burden.  The government made a detailed written proffer to the district court, spelling out the facts referable to its sentence reduction motion.  Appellant had a similar opportunity.  Yet, he offered no specifics to contradict the prosecution's proffer or to suggest material omissions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Beneath the rhetoric, appellant's filing evinced little more than the hope that, should a hearing eventuate, something helpful might emerge.  But more is exigible.  A district court need not grant an evidentiary hearing on a motion merely because a defendant's hopes spring eternal or because a defendant wishes to mount a fishing expedition.  See, e.g., DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44 (cautioning that evidentiary hearings cannot be provided upon demand, \"at the whim of a suitor\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a criminal defendant who seeks an evidentiary hearing on a motion must, at the very least, carry an entry-level burden by making \"a sufficient threshold showing that material facts [are] in doubt or in dispute.\"  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1173;  see also Franks v. Delaware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this instance, appellant offered no persuasive reason to believe that taking testimony would--or even might--be productive.  Thus, the district court, in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing, did not abuse its considerable discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We hold that we have jurisdiction to consider appellant's complaint anent the disposition of his Rule 35(b) motion.

The case does not bear the weight that appellant ascribes to it.  In the first place, the original opinion in Yesil has been superseded, and the court's revised opinion makes clear \"that the decision whether or not to grant an evidentiary hearing [on a Rule 35(b) motion] generally is committed to the [sentencing] court's discretion.\"  United States v.
