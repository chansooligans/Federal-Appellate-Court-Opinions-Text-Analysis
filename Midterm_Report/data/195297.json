The  note was secured by  a first\n\nmortgage  on the  Property.  After  the Developer  completed con-\n\nstruction  in 1988,  it \"leased\"  the health  club facility  to a\n\ncorporation called Greenleaf Sports  and Fitness Club, Inc. (\"the\n\nHealth Club\"),  which sold long-term charter  health club member-\n\nships to appellants, at  prices ranging from $2500 to $3500.1  In\n\nApril  1990,  the Developer  defaulted on  the  note.2   The Bank\n\nlater exercised its power  of sale under the first  mortgage, and\n\nthe Property  was  acquired by  appellee  A.B. Club  Holdings  (-\n\n                    \n\n     1The charter memberships entitled appellants to use the club\nfacilities,  subject  to their  payment  of  annual renewal  fees\nsubstantially below the annual fee for non-\"charter\" members.\n\n     2The Developer eventually initiated a chapter 11 reorganiza-\ntion proceeding, which was  later converted to chapter 7.   There\nis  no  evidence that  appellants filed  proofs  of claim  in the\nbankruptcy proceedings.\n\n                                2\n\n\"ABCH\"), the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\n          The Health Club vacated the leased premises five months\n\nafter the Developer's default, but the Bank and ABCH continued to\n\noperate a  health club  facility on  the premises, with  appellee\n\nClub Sports International (\"CSI\") as its managing entity.  During\n\na six-month  transitional  period  following  the  Health  Club's\n\nclosure, appellants were permitted to use the health club facili-\n\nties under the terms of their  alleged Health Club contracts.  In\n\nFebruary 1991,  however, CSI  informed appellants that  they must\n\npay higher fees, equaling fifty percent  of the fee for new  club\n                                                           \n\nmembers.\n\n          Appellants  promptly filed  a three-count  complaint in\n\nNew Hampshire Superior Court against, inter alia, the Bank, ABCH,\n                                                \n\nand CSI.  Count  1 sought a judicial declaration  that appellants\n\nheld  a \"unique  contractual property  right\" by virtue  of their\n\ncharter  club memberships,  and  that appellees  were either  the\n\nDeveloper's  successors-in-interest  or  its third-party  benefi-\n\nciaries, and therefore were  contractually obligated to honor the\n\ncharter membership contracts, see Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., 501 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1145,  1152   (1st  Cir.  1974)  (noting   indicia  of  successor\n\nliability).   Count  2  sought the  imposition of  a constructive\n\ntrust  upon all charter membership  fees still held by appellees,\n\non the ground that the  Bank had been aware from the  outset that\n\nthe  Developer  used $200,000  of appellants'  charter membership\n\nfees to repay its  construction loan, in violation of  the Devel-\n\noper's contractual promise to  appellants to segregate their fees\n\n                                3\n\nin  a trust fund.   Finally, Count 3  sought compensatory damages\n\n(or  a refund of all  membership fees) and/or  treble damages for\n\nappellees'  unfair  and  deceptive  trade  practices  in  willful\n\nviolation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (\"NHCPA\"),\n\nsee  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann    358-A:2, 358-A:10 (1993).  The Bank's\n   \n\nmotion to dismiss counts 1 and 3 for failure to state a claim was\n\ndenied by the superior court.3\n\n          In October  1991, the  Bank was declared  insolvent and\n\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver,\n\nremoved  the case  to  federal district  court.   See  12  U.S.C.\n                                                     \n\n  1819(b)(2)(B) (1993).  Appellants  promptly moved for remand to\n\nthe state  court,  arguing  that  resolution of  the  suit  would\n\nrequire \"only the  interpretation of the law of [New Hampshire].\"\n\nId.    1819(b)(2)  (D)(iii).   FDIC  opposed  remand, citing  its\n   \n\nintention to rely on  various federal-law defenses, including the\n\nunenforceability of  the alleged club membership  contracts under\n\nD'Oench Duhme  &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), as codified at\n                            \n\n12 U.S.C.   1823(e), and FDIC's  immunity from suit for compensa-\n\ntory damage  claims under the NHCPA, cf.  Timberland Design, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv.  First Serv. Bank  for Sav., 932  F.2d 46, 50  (1st Cir. 1991)\n                              \n\n(D'Oench  defense may  also foreclose  tort-based  claims against\n        \n\nFDIC based  on \"secret\"  agreements), and from  \"punitive\" treble\n\n                    \n\n     3The superior court  granted the motion  to dismiss Count  2\n(constructive trust), citing  appellants' failure to allege  that\nthe  Bank owed appellants a  fiduciary duty.   As appellants have\nnot reasserted their constructive  trust claim, we disregard case\nlaw cited  by appellants to the extent  it relates to the imposi-\ntion  of constructive trusts under New Hampshire law.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \nMilne v. Burlington Homes, Inc., 117 N.H. 813 (1977).\n                               \n\n                                4\n\ndamage awards under the  NHCPA, see, e.g., FDIC v.  Claycomb, 945\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 853,  861 (5th  Cir. 1991),  cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.  2301\n                                              \n\n(1992).  While the remand motion awaited decision, FDIC filed its\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n          The district court later rejected  a magistrate-judge's\n\nrecommendation  that the case be remanded to state court for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 12 U.S.C.   1819(b)(2)\n\n(D)(iii),4  and granted FDIC's motion for summary judgment on the\n\ntwo remaining counts in appellants' complaint.  Appellants appeal\n\nfrom the  summary judgment  order,  and from  the district  court\n\norder denying their motions for reconsideration.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.  Removal Jurisdiction \n                        \n\n          Appellants argue that FIRREA   1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) ousts\n\nthe  district  court  of  jurisdiction  because  their  complaint\n\nalleged one dispositive state-law claim unaffected by any federal\n\ndefense  advanced by FDIC.   Specifically, drawing  on an oblique\n\n                    \n\n     4As  a  threshold   argument,  appellants  claim   that  the\nmagistrate-judge's report and recommendation issued pursuant to a\nreferral under 28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A), rather than  subsection\n  636(b)(1)(B), because  a motion  to remand to  state court  for\nlack  of federal  jurisdiction  is  \"nondispositive.\"  Appellants\nargue that the district court improperly reviewed the magistrate-\njudge's findings de  novo, rather  than for \"clear  error\" or  as\n                         \n\"contrary to  law.\"  We disagree.   The magistrate-judge's report\nresolved  no disputed  jurisdictional facts.   Instead,  it dealt\nwith a pure issue  of law    whether FDIC's  anticipated defenses\nwere legally sufficient to  foreclose remand to the  state court.\nUnder  either subsection  636(b)(1)(A)  or  (B), the  recommended\n                                          \nconclusions of law were subject to de novo review by the district\n                                          \ncourt, and, in turn, by the court of appeals.\n\n                                5\n\nmention  in Count  I  that  their  charter memberships  confer  a\n\n\"unique contractual  property right,\"  appellants now  argue that\n                             \n\nthese memberships are roughly akin to mechanic's liens  under New\n\nHampshire law.\n\n          We have held that FDIC may not invoke the D'Oench Duhme\n                                                                 \n\ndefense to avoid certain state-law liens which attach to a failed\n\nbank's  assets  prior to  FDIC's  appointment as  receiver.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBateman v.

FDIC, 937 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1991),  however, we held\n                  \n\nthat  FIRREA   1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) embodies  a deliberate congres-\n                                                                 \n\nsional  abrogation  of  the  \"well-pleaded  complaint\"  rule, see\n                                                                 \n\nFranchise Tax  Bd. v.

McAllen State Bank, 975 F.2d  1145, 1149 (5th Cir. 1992);\n                          \n\nReding v.

Thus,  FIRREA\n    \n\n  1819(b)(2) (D)(iii) directs the district court \"to consider the\n\ncase  as a  whole     complaint and likely  defenses\"     and \"to\n                 \n\n                                6\n\ngauge  [the]  . . .  likely   significance\"  of  those  defenses.\n                                          \n\nCapizzi, 937 F.2d at  10, 11 (emphasis added); see Diaz, 975 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 1149-50 (\"[A]sserting a federal defense will not alone prevent\n\nremand  . . . [,]  the FDIC  must  assert a  defense  that raises\n\ncolorable issues of federal law.\") (emphasis added).\n         \n\n          The district court  relied on several  reasoned grounds\n\nfor its ruling  disallowing appellants'  motion for  remand.   We\n\naffirm  on a singularly sufficient ground.  The complaint asserts\n\nseveral alternative claims  for relief.  Even  if their so-called\n\nproperty-right  or  \"mechanic's lien\"  claim  were  sound on  the\n\nmerits, and further,  assuming it were found  invulnerable to the\n\nD'Oench Duhme defense by reason of the Bateman  exception, appel-\n                                              \n\nlants also  asserted willful  violations of  the NHCPA for  which\n\ntreble damages might be recoverable because of appellees' interim\n                                                                 \n\nrefusal  to permit them to  use the health  club facilities under\n\nthe terms of their  original membership contracts.  In  turn, the\n\ntreble-damages demand under the  NHCPA would implicate FDIC's two\n\nfederal defenses to  any NHCPA recovery.   See Timberland Design,\n                                                                \n\n932 F.2d at 50; Claycomb, 945 F.2d at 861.  On the other hand, if\n                        \n\nappellants'  \"mechanic's lien\"  claim were  found nonmeritorious,\n\nthe court would  be required to rule on their claim for compensa-\n\ntory  damages for breach of  their membership contracts, based on\n\nappellees' alleged liability as the contractual successors of the\n\nDeveloper or the  Health Club.   In the  latter event, the  court\n\nwould be required to rule on the D'Oench Duhme defense.\n                                              \n\n          Finally, even at the preliminary  jurisdictional stage,\n\n                                7\n\nFDIC's various federal defenses, see supra p. 4, and particularly\n                                          \n\nits D'Oench Duhme defense,  were more than colorable.   See Bate-\n                                                                 \n\nman, 970 F.2d at 926-27 (under D'Oench Duhme, alleged \"agreement\"\n                                            \n\nmust be in writing, executed by bank, approved by bank's board of\n\ndirectors,  and kept continuously  in bank  records from  date of\n\nexecution).   Even  as  late as  summary  judgment, for  example,\n\nappellants  had yet to produce  a copy of  the charter membership\n\ncontract,  let alone a  copy of the  construction loan agreement,\n\nalthough the former document presumably was within their control,\n\nand the existence and whereabouts of both documents form the crux\n                                 \n\nof their  alleged contract,  \"equitable lien,\" and  NHCPA claims.\n\nMoreover, given appellees' allegations that the Health Club was a\n\ncorporate entity distinct from  the Developer, and never directly\n                         \n\ncontracted  with the Bank in  any capacity, FDIC's  claim that no\n\nwritten \"agreement\" appeared in the Bank's records on the date of\n\nFDIC's appointment is  far from  frivolous.

Soc'y, 3  F.3d 495, 497\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).5\n\n                    \n\n     5The district  court  made four  relevant determinations  in\ngranting summary judgment for  FDIC.  First, appellants generated\nno trialworthy  factual claim that appellees  (by acquiring title\nto  the real  property  which the  Health  Club leased  from  the\n                                                      \n\n                                8\n\n          At the outset, we note that appellants' claims based on\n\ntheir  alleged status  as contractual  successors to,  and third-\n\nparty  beneficiaries of, the Health Club have been waived, as has\n\ntheir NHCPA  claim,  because  of their  failure  to  present  any\n\ndeveloped argument on these issues in their appellate brief.  See\n                                                                 \n\nRhode  Island Hosp.  Trust  Nat'l Bank  v. Howard  Communications\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.,  980 F.2d 823, 828 n. 8  (1st Cir. 1992) (issues raised in\n     \n\nappellate brief in  a perfunctory manner, without any  attempt at\n\ndeveloped argumentation,  are deemed  waived).   Moreover, appel-\n\nlants concede that these  issues were \"never raised\" in  the only\n\ntwo pertinent memoranda  submitted to the district  court.  Brief\n\nfor Appellants at 12; see Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993) (issues raised for the first\n   \n\ntime on appeal are deemed waived for failure to preserve).\n\n          Appellants fare  little better on their  only remaining\n\nclaim;  viz.,  their  alleged  \"lien\" on  the  Property,  roughly\n            \n\nanalogous to a state-law  mechanic's lien, assertedly entitled to\n\npriority  over  the legal  title  acquired  by the  Bank  through\n\n                    \n\nDeveloper)  became contractual successors  of the Health Club, or\never acquired the  Health Club's assets  or assumed its  liabili-\nties.   Second, appellants, as alleged third-party beneficiaries,\ncould not  enforce the  Health Club membership  contracts against\nappellees, since  third-party beneficiaries may sue,  but may not\nbe  sued, for contract damages.  Third, appellants cited no legal\n        \nauthority or  supporting facts  for their novel  state-law theory\nthat their  charter membership contracts were  akin to mechanic's\nliens;  that  is, property  interests  \"running\"  with the  land.\nSpecifically, plaintiffs  failed to  show that they  supplied the\nDeveloper  with labor  or materials,  or perfected  their alleged\n\"lien\" as  required under New  Hampshire law.   Finally,  because\nappellees were not contractually bound to the terms of the Health\nClub contracts, appellees could not have violated the NHCPA.\n\n                                9\n\nforeclosure.  Although appellants  continued to press this highly\n\ndubious claim even at oral argument, as though it were founded on\n\nsome  straightforward  extrapolation   from  New  Hampshire  law,\n\nneither at argument  nor in their appellate brief have appellants\n\narticulated  any rationale for their  claim, or cited  to any New\n                                                             \n\nHampshire  state court  decision offering the  remotest support.6\n\nIf a  claimant cannot, or will not, attempt a succinct and cogent\n\narticulation  of its  claim in  its appellate  brief, it  may not\n                                                    \n\nexpect the court to supply it.7\n\n          Even assuming their chameleonic liability theories were\n\npreserved  below,  and raised  on  appeal,  summary judgment  was\n\nwarranted.  Appellants premised their \"mechanic's lien\" theory on\n\na basic maxim of New Hampshire law:   \"It is well settled that if\n\na party [viz., the Bank]  is present and sees another [viz.,  the\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n     6Instead, their appellate brief refers to a nine-page memor-\nandum of law in opposition to  the Bank's motion to dismiss which\n                                                           \nappellants submitted  to the New Hampshire  Superior Court almost\nthree years ago, before FDIC ever removed the case.  But see Fed.\n                                                            \nR.  App. P. 28(a)(5) (appellate  brief \"shall contain the conten-\ntions  of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and\nthe  reasons therefor,  with citations  to the  authorities . . .\nrelied on\"); cf. Katz v. King, 627 F.2d 568, 575  (1st Cir. 1980)\n                             \n(\"[T]he argument must appear within the four corners of the brief\n                                                    \nfiled in this court.   Attorneys cannot circumvent FRAP  28(g) by\nincorporating  by reference  another brief  filed in  another fo-\nrum.\") (emphasis added).   Furthermore, procedural lapses  aside,\nnowhere in  their three-year-old state court  memorandum does the\nkey  phrase in  their  \"moving target\"  offensive     \"mechanic's\nlien\"    ever appear.\n\n     7Appellants further argue  that the superior  court's denial\nof appellees' motion to  dismiss Count 1 was somehow  dispositive\non the question whether their \"mechanic's lien\" analogy is viable\nunder New Hampshire law.  We disagree.   The state court premised\nits ruling  on the ground that  Count 1 stated a  valid claim for\ncontractual successor  liability only, not  an equitable estoppel\n                                \nor mechanic's lien claim.\n\n                                10\n\nDeveloper or Health Club] sell and convey property [viz., member-\n                                                       \n\nship contracts] to which he  may assert title, without disclosing\n\nhis title, or objecting to  the conveyance, and the sale is  made\n\nwith full  knowledge on  his part,  he  will be  estopped by  his\n\nsilence  from  setting  up  his title  thereafter.\"    Corbett v.\n                                                              \n\nNorcross, 35 N.H. 99, 115 (1857) (emphasis added).  \n        \n\n          In  their state  court  memorandum, see  supra note  6,\n                                                        \n\nappellants  cite  a  string  of New  Hampshire  cases  containing\n\ngeneral  discussions of  the  equitable estoppel  and good  faith\n\npurchaser doctrines.  Appellants  attempt to predicate the appli-\n\ncability of those  broad doctrines  in the present  case on  four\n\ncore allegations:  (1) the Bank knew before the Developer execut-\n                                           \n\ned  its  mortgage that  the  Developer intended  to  sell charter\n\nmemberships to  finance its  repayment of the  construction loan;\n\n(2) the construction loan agreement contained a provision wherein\n\nthe  Bank  \"agreed\" to  accept  club membership  fee  proceeds in\n\nrepayment of the loan; (3) after June 1988, the  Bank learned (or\n\nshould have  learned) that the Developer  had promised appellants\n\nit would establish a segregated trust fund to hold all membership\n\nfees,  and that the Developer  willfully failed to  abide by this\n\npromise; and (4) the Bank knowingly received $200,000  in member-\n\nship fee proceeds in repayment of its loan.8\n\n                    \n\n     8Appellants  now  concede  that  their  charter  memberships\ncannot meet the literal  requirements of a mechanic's lien  under\n                       \nNew  Hampshire law,  since appellants  neither supplied  labor or\nmaterials, nor perfected their  alleged \"liens.\"  See  supra note\n                                                            \n5.  Appellants present no argumentation or authority  which would\nindicate that perfection is a dispensable requisite to mechanic's\nlien priority over  a duly recorded mortgage lien.  See N.H. Rev.\n                                                       \n\n                                11\n\n          The fundamental problem for appellants is their failure\n\nto produce  competent evidence  supporting these  crucial factual\n\nallegations.  See Town of Nottingham v. Lee Homes, Inc., 118 N.H.\n                                                       \n\n438, 442 (1978) (\"the  party asserting [equitable] estoppel bears\n\nthe  burden of proving it\");  see also Celotex  Corp. v. Catrett,\n                                                                \n\n477 U.S. 317,  322 (1986)  (where nonmovant under  Rule 56  would\n\nbear the  burden of proof at trial, its failure to produce suffi-\n\ncient evidence  to generate a trialworthy  issue warrants summary\n\njudgment).   Most conspicuously,  appellants have yet  to proffer\n\nthe alleged charter  membership contracts, presumably  accessible\n\nto  them without resort to  discovery.9  Nor  have they presented\n                                     \n\n                    \n\nStat.  Ann.   447:10 (1993).  Thus, appellants' Bateman exception\n                                                       \nclaim, see supra at p. 6, fails as a matter of law.\n                \n\n     9Even  if they had  presented competent Rule  56 evidence on\nthese   factual  matters,  appellants   would  still  face  three\nconsiderable  hurdles on  the merits.   See  also note  10 infra.\n                                                                \nFirst,  unlike  all of  the aggrieved  parties  in the  cited New\nHampshire cases,  appellants have not made  the threshold showing\nthat the law of  any state recognizes health club  memberships as\n\"property\"  interests.  The  only case appellants  cite is wholly\nunsupportive.   See Silver  Hills Country  Club v. Sobieski,  361\n                                                           \nP.2d 906,  907  (Cal. 1961)  (considering  analytically  distinct\nquestion whether the sales  of club memberships were \"securities\"\nsubject to regulation California's Corporate Securities Act).\n     Second, the  New Hampshire  cases appellants cite  involve a\nnarrow and  distinctive species  of fraud; namely,  omissions and\nother misleading conduct  (e.g., silence, execution of  releases,\n                               \nsharing in sale  proceeds) by  a defendant which  lead the  party\nacquiring  the property to believe that the defendant neither has\nnor  will  assert  any  claim, superseding  title,  or  competing\ninterest in the property conveyed.  See, e.g., New Hampshire Sav.\n                                                                 \nBank v. National Rockland  Bank, 93 N.H. 326, 329  (1945) (estop-\n                               \nping  executor of  decedent  owner of  passbook savings  account,\nwhere  decedent had  made  inter vivos  transfer  of passbook  to\n                                      \ndaughter-in-law, along with a  withdrawal form endorsed in blank,\nand  daughter-in-law pledged passbook  as collateral for personal\nloan).   Appellants' promised evidence  would not  show that  the\nBank concealed its  interest in the Property, nor  can appellants\n                            \nplausibly dispute  that they  were at  all times on  constructive\n\n                                12\n\nany other evidence to  rebut appellees' proof,  in the form of  a\n\nsworn  affidavit by  the Bank's  former vice-president,  that the\n\nDeveloper did  not directly contract with  appellants, but leased\n                                                                 \n\nthe health club  facilities to a distinct corporate entity (i.e.,\n                                                                \n\nthe Health  Club)  which in  turn  entered into  club  membership\n                                 \n\ncontracts with  the appellants.

Club Holdings (\"ABCH\"), the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Health Club vacated the leased premises five months after the Developer's default, but the Bank and ABCH continued to operate a health club facility on the premises, with appellee Club Sports International (\"CSI\") as its managing entity.  During a six-month transitional period following the Health Club's closure, appellants were permitted to use the health club facilities under the terms of their alleged Health Club contracts.  In February 1991, however, CSI informed appellants that they must pay higher fees, equaling fifty percent of the fee for new club members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants promptly filed a three-count complaint in New Hampshire Superior Court against, inter alia, the Bank, ABCH, and CSI.  Count 1 sought a judicial declaration that appellants held a \"unique contractual property right\" by virtue of their charter club memberships, and that appellees were either the Developer's successors-in-interest or its third-party beneficiaries, and therefore were contractually obligated to honor the charter membership contracts,  see Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1152 (1st Cir. 1974) (noting indicia of successor liability).  Count 2 sought the imposition of a constructive trust upon all charter membership fees still held by appellees, on the ground that the Bank had been aware from the outset that the Developer used $200,000 of appellants' charter membership fees to repay its construction loan, in violation of the Developer's contractual promise to appellants to segregate their fees in a trust fund.  Finally, Count 3 sought compensatory damages (or a refund of all membership fees) and/or treble damages for appellees' unfair and deceptive trade practices in willful violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (\"NHCPA\"), see N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann Secs. 358-A:2, 358-A:10 (1993).  The Bank's motion to dismiss counts 1 and 3 for failure to state a claim was denied by the superior court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, the Bank was declared insolvent and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver, removed the case to federal district court.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(B) (1993).  Appellants promptly moved for remand to the state court, arguing that resolution of the suit would require \"only the interpretation of the law of [New Hampshire].\"  Id. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii).  FDIC opposed remand, citing its intention to rely on various federal-law defenses, including the unenforceability of the alleged club membership contracts under  D'Oench Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942), as codified at 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e), and FDIC's immunity from suit for compensatory damage claims under the NHCPA,  cf.  Timberland Design, Inc. v. First Serv.  Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1991) (D'Oench defense may also foreclose tort-based claims against FDIC based on \"secret\" agreements), and from \"punitive\" treble damage awards under the NHCPA,  see, e.g., FDIC v. Claycomb, 945 F.2d 853, 861 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2301 (1992).  While the remand motion awaited decision, FDIC filed its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court later rejected a magistrate-judge's recommendation that the case be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and granted FDIC's motion for summary judgment on the two remaining counts in appellants' complaint.  Appellants appeal from the summary judgment order, and from the district court order denying their motions for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Removal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that FIRREA Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) ousts the district court of jurisdiction because their complaint alleged one dispositive state-law claim unaffected by any federal defense advanced by FDIC.  Specifically, drawing on an oblique mention in Count I that their charter memberships confer a \"unique contractual property right,\" appellants now argue that these memberships are roughly akin to mechanic's liens under New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that FDIC may not invoke the D'Oench Duhme defense to avoid certain state-law liens which attach to a failed bank's assets prior to FDIC's appointment as receiver.   See Bateman v. FDIC, 970 F.2d 924, 927 (1st Cir. 1992) (Maine mechanic's lien not an \"agreement\" within meaning of D'Oench doctrine).  In  Capizzi v. FDIC, 937 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1991), however, we held that FIRREA Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) embodies a deliberate congressional abrogation of the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule,  see Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1983) (defining phrase \"arising under\" federal law), which in other contexts permits a district court to invoke its nondiversity removal jurisdiction only if the complaint alone, without reference to the character of any anticipated defense under federal law, discloses that the state-law claim implicates a substantial federal question.  Capizzi, 937 F.2d at 11 (noting that Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) \"expanded the FDIC's powers, and ... federal jurisdiction \") (emphasis added);   see Diaz v. McAllen State Bank, 975 F.2d 1145, 1149 (5th Cir. 1992);   Reding v. FDIC, 942 F.2d 1254, 1258 (8th Cir. 1991);   Lazuka v. FDIC, 931 F.2d 1530, 1535 (11th Cir. 1991).  Thus, FIRREA Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) directs the district court \"to consider the case as a whole-complaint and likely defenses\"-and \"to gauge [the] ... likely significance \" of those defenses.   Capizzi, 937 F.2d at 10, 11 (emphasis added);   see Diaz, 975 F.2d at 1149-50 (\"[A]sserting a federal defense will not alone prevent remand ... [,] the FDIC must assert a defense that raises colorable issues of federal law.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on several reasoned grounds for its ruling disallowing appellants' motion for remand.  We affirm on a singularly sufficient ground.  The complaint asserts several alternative claims for relief.  Even if their so-called property-right or \"mechanic's lien\" claim were sound on the merits, and further, assuming it were found invulnerable to the D'Oench Duhme defense by reason of the Bateman exception, appellants also asserted willful violations of the NHCPA for which treble damages might be recoverable because of appellees' interim refusal to permit them to use the health club facilities under the terms of their original membership contracts.  In turn, the treble-damages demand under the NHCPA would implicate FDIC's two federal defenses to any NHCPA recovery.   See Timberland Design, 932 F.2d at 50;   Claycomb, 945 F.2d at 861.  On the other hand, if appellants' \"mechanic's lien\" claim were found nonmeritorious, the court would be required to rule on their claim for compensatory damages for breach of their membership contracts, based on appellees' alleged liability as the contractual successors of the Developer or the Health Club.  In the latter event, the court would be required to rule on the D'Oench Duhme defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even at the preliminary jurisdictional stage, FDIC's various federal defenses, see supra p. 4, and particularly its D'Oench Duhme defense, were more than colorable.   See Bateman, 970 F.2d at 926-27 (under D'Oench Duhme, alleged \"agreement\" must be in writing, executed by bank, approved by bank's board of directors, and kept continuously in bank records from date of execution).  Even as late as summary judgment, for example, appellants had yet to produce a copy of the charter membership contract, let alone a copy of the construction loan agreement, although the former document presumably was within their control, and the existence and whereabouts of both documents form the crux of their alleged contract, \"equitable lien,\" and NHCPA claims.  Moreover, given appellees' allegations that the Health Club was a corporate entity distinct from the Developer, and never directly contracted with the Bank in any capacity, FDIC's claim that no written \"agreement\" appeared in the Bank's records on the date of FDIC's appointment is far from frivolous.  The district court correctly denied the motion for remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A summary judgment ruling is reviewed de novo, employing the same standards incumbent on the district court, and resolving all evidentiary issues in the light most favorable to appellants.   Gaskell v. The Harvard Coop.  Soc'y, 3 F.3d 495, 497 (1st Cir. 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that appellants' claims based on their alleged status as contractual successors to, and third-party beneficiaries of, the Health Club have been waived, as has their NHCPA claim, because of their failure to present any developed argument on these issues in their appellate brief.   See Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v. Howard Communications Corp., 980 F.2d 823, 828 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1992) (issues raised in appellate brief in a perfunctory manner, without any attempt at developed argumentation, are deemed waived).  Moreover, appellants concede that these issues were \"never raised\" in the only two pertinent memoranda submitted to the district court.  Brief for Appellants at 12;   see Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993) (issues raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived for failure to preserve).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants fare little better on their only remaining claim;  viz., their alleged \"lien\" on the Property, roughly analogous to a state-law mechanic's lien, assertedly entitled to priority over the legal title acquired by the Bank through foreclosure.  Although appellants continued to press this highly dubious claim even at oral argument, as though it were founded on some straightforward extrapolation from New Hampshire law, neither at argument nor in their appellate brief have appellants articulated any rationale for their claim, or cited to any New Hampshire state court decision offering the remotest support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If a claimant cannot, or will not, attempt a succinct and cogent articulation of its claim in its appellate brief, it may not expect the court to supply it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming their chameleonic liability theories were preserved below, and raised on appeal, summary judgment was warranted.  Appellants premised their \"mechanic's lien\" theory on a basic maxim of New Hampshire law:  \"It is well settled that if a party [viz., the Bank] is present and sees another [viz., the Developer or Health Club] sell and convey property [viz., membership contracts] to which he may assert title, without disclosing his title, or objecting to the conveyance, and the sale is made with full knowledge on his part, he will be estopped by his silence from setting up his title thereafter.\"   Corbett v. Norcross, 35 N.H. 99, 115 (1857) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their state court memorandum, see supra note 6, appellants cite a string of New Hampshire cases containing general discussions of the equitable estoppel and good faith purchaser doctrines.  Appellants attempt to predicate the applicability of those broad doctrines in the present case on four core allegations: (1) the Bank knew before the Developer executed its mortgage that the Developer intended to sell charter memberships to finance its repayment of the construction loan;  (2) the construction loan agreement contained a provision wherein the Bank \"agreed\" to accept club membership fee proceeds in repayment of the loan;  (3) after June 1988, the Bank learned (or should have learned) that the Developer had promised appellants it would establish a segregated trust fund to hold all membership fees, and that the Developer willfully failed to abide by this promise;  and (4) the Bank knowingly received $200,000 in membership fee proceeds in repayment of its loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental problem for appellants is their failure to produce competent evidence supporting these crucial factual allegations.   See Town of Nottingham v. Lee Homes, Inc., 118 N.H. 438, 442 (1978) (\"the party asserting [equitable] estoppel bears the burden of proving it\");   see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (where nonmovant under Rule 56 would bear the burden of proof at trial, its failure to produce sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment).  Most conspicuously, appellants have yet to proffer the alleged charter membership contracts, presumably accessible to them without resort to discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Nor have they presented any other evidence to rebut appellees' proof, in the form of a sworn affidavit by the Bank's former vice-president, that the Developer did not directly contract with appellants, but leased the health club facilities to a distinct corporate entity (i.e., the Health Club) which in turn entered into club membership contracts with the appellants.  Further, appellants' sole evidence of the alleged agreements and communications between the Bank and the Developer is an affidavit by appellants' attorney, generally relating evidence appellants would present  at trial.  But see, e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] mere promise to produce admissible evidence at trial does not suffice to thwart the summary judgment ax.\").  The affidavit is unaccompanied by documentary support.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(e);  10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2722, at 56-58 (2d ed. 1983) (averments made in Rule 56 affidavit to unattached contracts and documents may be sufficient to establish a triable issue as to their existence, but not as to their terms ).  Nor does the affidavit present any other basis for evaluating the affiant-attorney's personal knowledge of contractual transactions between the Bank and the Developer, the Developer and the Health Club, or the Health Club and appellants.   Cf. Postscript Enters. v. City of Bridgeton, 905 F.2d 223, 226 (8th Cir. 1990) (\" 'Attorneys' affidavits not based upon personal knowledge have been held not to comply with Rule 56(e).' \")  (citing  Kamen v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 791 F.2d 1006, 1011 (2d Cir. 1986)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The charter memberships entitled appellants to use the club facilities, subject to their payment of annual renewal fees substantially below the annual fee for non-\"charter\" members</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Developer eventually initiated a chapter 11 reorganization proceeding, which was later converted to chapter 7.

See, e.g., Milne v. Burlington Homes, Inc., 117 N.H. 813 (1977)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As a threshold argument, appellants claim that the magistrate-judge's report and recommendation issued pursuant to a referral under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(A), rather than subsection Sec. 636(b)(1)(B), because a motion to remand to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction is \"nondispositive.\"  Appellants argue that the district court improperly reviewed the magistrate-judge's findings de novo, rather than for \"clear error\" or as \"contrary to law.\"  We disagree.  The magistrate-judge's report resolved no disputed jurisdictional facts.  Instead, it dealt with a pure issue of law-whether FDIC's anticipated defenses were legally sufficient to foreclose remand to the state court.  Under either subsection 636(b)(1)(A) or (B), the recommended conclusions of law were subject to de novo review by the district court, and, in turn, by the court of appeals</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The district court made four relevant determinations in granting summary judgment for FDIC.  First, appellants generated no trialworthy factual claim that appellees (by acquiring title to the real property which the Health Club leased from the Developer) became contractual successors of the Health Club, or ever acquired the Health Club's assets or assumed its liabilities.  Second, appellants, as alleged third-party beneficiaries, could not enforce the Health Club membership contracts against appellees, since third-party beneficiaries may sue, but may not be sued, for contract damages.  Third, appellants cited no legal authority orsupporting facts for their novel state-law theory that their charter membership contracts were akin to mechanic's liens;  that is, property interests \"running\" with the land.  Specifically, plaintiffs failed to show that they supplied the Developer with labor or materials, or perfected their alleged \"lien\" as required under New Hampshire law.  Finally, because appellees were not contractually bound to the terms of the Health Club contracts, appellees could not have violated the NHCPA</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Instead, their appellate brief refers to a nine-page memorandum of law in opposition to the Bank's motion to dismiss which appellants submitted to the New Hampshire Superior Court almost three years ago, before FDIC ever removed the case.  But see Fed.  R. App.  P. 28(a)(5) (appellate brief \"shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities ... relied on\");   cf.  Katz v. King, 627 F.2d 568, 575 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"[T]he argument must appear within the four corners of the brief filed in this court.  Attorneys cannot circumvent FRAP 28(g) by incorporating by reference another brief filed in another forum.\")  (emphasis added).  Furthermore, procedural lapses aside, nowhere in their three-year-old state court memorandum does the key phrase in their \"moving target\" offensive-\"mechanic's lien\"-ever appear</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Appellants further argue that the superior court's denial of appellees' motion to dismiss Count 1 was somehow dispositive on the question whether their \"mechanic's lien\" analogy is viable under New Hampshire law.  We disagree.  The state court premised its ruling on the ground that Count 1 stated a valid claim for contractual successor liability only, not an equitable estoppel or mechanic's lien claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Appellants now concede that their charter memberships cannot meet the literal requirements of a mechanic's lien under New Hampshire law, since appellants neither supplied labor or materials, nor perfected their alleged \"liens.\"  See supra note 5. Appellants present no argumentation or authority which would indicate that perfection is a dispensable requisite to mechanic's lien priority over a duly recorded mortgage lien.  See N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. Sec. 447:10 (1993).  Thus, appellants' Bateman exception claim, see supra at p. 6, fails as a matter of law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Even if they had presented competent Rule 56 evidence on these factual matters, appellants would still face three considerable hurdles on the merits.  See also note 10 infra.  First, unlike all of the aggrieved parties in the cited New Hampshire cases, appellants have not made the threshold showing that the law of any state recognizes health club memberships as \"property\" interests.  The only case appellants cite is wholly unsupportive.   See Silver Hills Country Club v. Sobieski, 361 P.2d 906, 907 (Cal. 1961) (considering analytically distinct question whether the sales of club memberships were \"securities\" subject to regulation California's Corporate Securities Act)</p>\n        <p>Second, the New Hampshire cases appellants cite involve a narrow and distinctive species of fraud;  namely, omissions and other misleading conduct (e.g., silence, execution of releases, sharing in sale proceeds) by a defendant which lead the party acquiring the property to believe that the defendant neither has nor will assert any claim, superseding title, or competing interest in the property conveyed.   See, e.g., New Hampshire Sav. Bank v. National Rockland Bank, 93 N.H. 326, 329 (1945) (estopping executor of decedent owner of passbook savings account, where decedent had made inter vivos transfer of passbook to daughter-in-law, along with a withdrawal form endorsed in blank, and daughter-in-law pledged passbook as collateral for personal loan).  Appellants' promised evidence would not show that the Bank concealed its interest in the Property, nor can appellants plausibly dispute that they were at all times on constructive notice of the Bank's recorded mortgage.</p>\n        <p>Finally, even if the Bank might be estopped from asserting its mortgage and power of sale, appellants offer no explanation as to how such an estoppel would insulate them from the defenses of the Bank's successors-particularly the FDIC with its D'Oench Duhme defense-absent evidence that these grantees knew of the facts giving rise to a bar to the Bank's claim.   See, e.g., InternationalChimney Corp. v. 26 West Spring St. Assocs., 561 N.Y.S.2d 933, 934 (App.  Div. 1990) (\"[E]quitable estoppel should be applied with ... even greater caution when sought to be invoked against a subsequent owner.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Nor does the record indicate that appellants ever requested \"a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).   See, e.g., De la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 12, (1st Cir. 1993) [1994 U.S. App.  LEXIS 1502, at p(1st Cir.  Jan. 31, 1993) ]</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The note was secured by a first mortgage on the Property.  After the Developer completed construction in 1988, it \"leased\" the health club facility to a corporation called Greenleaf Sports and Fitness Club, Inc.  (\"the Health Club\"), which sold long-term charter health club memberships to appellants, at prices ranging from $2500 to $3500.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In April 1990, the Developer defaulted on the note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Bank later exercised its power of sale under the first mortgage, and the Property was acquired by appellee A.B. Club Holdings (\"ABCH\"), the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Health Club vacated the leased premises five months after the Developer's default, but the Bank and ABCH continued to operate a health club facility on the premises, with appellee Club Sports International (\"CSI\") as its managing entity.  During a six-month transitional period following the Health Club's closure, appellants were permitted to use the health club facilities under the terms of their alleged Health Club contracts.  In February 1991, however, CSI informed appellants that they must pay higher fees, equaling fifty percent of the fee for new club members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants promptly filed a three-count complaint in New Hampshire Superior Court against, inter alia, the Bank, ABCH, and CSI.  Count 1 sought a judicial declaration that appellants held a \"unique contractual property right\" by virtue of their charter club memberships, and that appellees were either the Developer's successors-in-interest or its third-party beneficiaries, and therefore were contractually obligated to honor the charter membership contracts,  see Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321143\"><a href=\"/opinion/321143/alphonse-cyr-jr-and-arlene-cyr-v-b-offen-co-inc-and-third-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1152 (1st Cir. 1974) (noting indicia of successor liability).  Count 2 sought the imposition of a constructive trust upon all charter membership fees still held by appellees, on the ground that the Bank had been aware from the outset that the Developer used $200,000 of appellants' charter membership fees to repay its construction loan, in violation of the Developer's contractual promise to appellants to segregate their fees in a trust fund.  Finally, Count 3 sought compensatory damages (or a refund of all membership fees) and/or treble damages for appellees' unfair and deceptive trade practices in willful violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (\"NHCPA\"), see N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann Secs. 358-A:2, 358-A:10 (1993).  The Bank's motion to dismiss counts 1 and 3 for failure to state a claim was denied by the superior court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, the Bank was declared insolvent and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver, removed the case to federal district court.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(B) (1993).  Appellants promptly moved for remand to the state court, arguing that resolution of the suit would require \"only the interpretation of the law of [New Hampshire].\"  Id. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii).  FDIC opposed remand, citing its intention to rely on various federal-law defenses, including the unenforceability of the alleged club membership contracts under  D'Oench Duhme &amp; Co. v.

Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and granted FDIC's motion for summary judgment on the two remaining counts in appellants' complaint.

Specifically, drawing on an oblique mention in Count I that their charter memberships confer a \"unique contractual property right,\" appellants now argue that these memberships are roughly akin to mechanic's liens under New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that FDIC may not invoke the D'Oench Duhme defense to avoid certain state-law liens which attach to a failed bank's assets prior to FDIC's appointment as receiver.   See Bateman v.

Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110990\"><a href=\"/opinion/110990/franchise-tax-bd-of-cal-v-construction-laborers-vacation-trust-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-10 (1983) (defining phrase \"arising under\" federal law), which in other contexts permits a district court to invoke its nondiversity removal jurisdiction only if the complaint alone, without reference to the character of any anticipated defense under federal law, discloses that the state-law claim implicates a substantial federal question.  Capizzi, 937 F.2d at 11 (noting that Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) \"expanded the FDIC's powers, and ... federal jurisdiction \") (emphasis added);   see Diaz v. McAllen State Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591157\"><a href=\"/opinion/591157/iago-xes-rodriguez-diaz-v-mcallen-state-bank-federal-deposit-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1149 (5th Cir. 1992);   Reding v.

Thus, FIRREA Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D)(iii) directs the district court \"to consider the case as a whole-complaint and likely defenses\"-and \"to gauge [the] ... likely significance \" of those defenses.   Capizzi, 937 F.2d at 10, 11 (emphasis added);   see Diaz, 975 F.2d at 1149-50 (\"[A]sserting a federal defense will not alone prevent remand ... [,] the FDIC must assert a defense that raises colorable issues of federal law.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on several reasoned grounds for its ruling disallowing appellants' motion for remand.  We affirm on a singularly sufficient ground.  The complaint asserts several alternative claims for relief.  Even if their so-called property-right or \"mechanic's lien\" claim were sound on the merits, and further, assuming it were found invulnerable to the D'Oench Duhme defense by reason of the Bateman exception, appellants also asserted willful violations of the NHCPA for which treble damages might be recoverable because of appellees' interim refusal to permit them to use the health club facilities under the terms of their original membership contracts.  In turn, the treble-damages demand under the NHCPA would implicate FDIC's two federal defenses to any NHCPA recovery.   See Timberland Design, 932 F.2d at 50;   Claycomb, 945 F.2d at 861.  On the other hand, if appellants' \"mechanic's lien\" claim were found nonmeritorious, the court would be required to rule on their claim for compensatory damages for breach of their membership contracts, based on appellees' alleged liability as the contractual successors of the Developer or the Health Club.  In the latter event, the court would be required to rule on the D'Oench Duhme defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even at the preliminary jurisdictional stage, FDIC's various federal defenses, see supra p. 4, and particularly its D'Oench Duhme defense, were more than colorable.   See Bateman, 970 F.2d at 926-27 (under D'Oench Duhme, alleged \"agreement\" must be in writing, executed by bank, approved by bank's board of directors, and kept continuously in bank records from date of execution).  Even as late as summary judgment, for example, appellants had yet to produce a copy of the charter membership contract, let alone a copy of the construction loan agreement, although the former document presumably was within their control, and the existence and whereabouts of both documents form the crux of their alleged contract, \"equitable lien,\" and NHCPA claims.  Moreover, given appellees' allegations that the Health Club was a corporate entity distinct from the Developer, and never directly contracted with the Bank in any capacity, FDIC's claim that no written \"agreement\" appeared in the Bank's records on the date of FDIC's appointment is far from frivolous.  The district court correctly denied the motion for remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A summary judgment ruling is reviewed de novo, employing the same standards incumbent on the district court, and resolving all evidentiary issues in the light most favorable to appellants.   Gaskell v. The Harvard Coop.  Soc'y, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628959\"><a href=\"/opinion/628959/david-and-carolyn-gaskell-v-the-harvard-cooperative-society-david-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 497 (1st Cir. 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that appellants' claims based on their alleged status as contractual successors to, and third-party beneficiaries of, the Health Club have been waived, as has their NHCPA claim, because of their failure to present any developed argument on these issues in their appellate brief.   See Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v. Howard Communications Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596107\"><a href=\"/opinion/596107/rhode-island-hospital-trust-national-bank-v-howard-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 828 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1992) (issues raised in appellate brief in a perfunctory manner, without any attempt at developed argumentation, are deemed waived).  Moreover, appellants concede that these issues were \"never raised\" in the only two pertinent memoranda submitted to the district court.  Brief for Appellants at 12;   see Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602828\"><a href=\"/opinion/602828/dennis-vanhaaren-v-state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993) (issues raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived for failure to preserve).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants fare little better on their only remaining claim;  viz., their alleged \"lien\" on the Property, roughly analogous to a state-law mechanic's lien, assertedly entitled to priority over the legal title acquired by the Bank through foreclosure.  Although appellants continued to press this highly dubious claim even at oral argument, as though it were founded on some straightforward extrapolation from New Hampshire law, neither at argument nor in their appellate brief have appellants articulated any rationale for their claim, or cited to any New Hampshire state court decision offering the remotest support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If a claimant cannot, or will not, attempt a succinct and cogent articulation of its claim in its appellate brief, it may not expect the court to supply it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming their chameleonic liability theories were preserved below, and raised on appeal, summary judgment was warranted.  Appellants premised their \"mechanic's lien\" theory on a basic maxim of New Hampshire law:  \"It is well settled that if a party [viz., the Bank] is present and sees another [viz., the Developer or Health Club] sell and convey property [viz., membership contracts] to which he may assert title, without disclosing his title, or objecting to the conveyance, and the sale is made with full knowledge on his part, he will be estopped by his silence from setting up his title thereafter.\"   Corbett v. Norcross, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></span>, 115 (1857) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their state court memorandum, see supra note 6, appellants cite a string of New Hampshire cases containing general discussions of the equitable estoppel and good faith purchaser doctrines.  Appellants attempt to predicate the applicability of those broad doctrines in the present case on four core allegations: (1) the Bank knew before the Developer executed its mortgage that the Developer intended to sell charter memberships to finance its repayment of the construction loan;  (2) the construction loan agreement contained a provision wherein the Bank \"agreed\" to accept club membership fee proceeds in repayment of the loan;  (3) after June 1988, the Bank learned (or should have learned) that the Developer had promised appellants it would establish a segregated trust fund to hold all membership fees, and that the Developer willfully failed to abide by this promise;  and (4) the Bank knowingly received $200,000 in membership fee proceeds in repayment of its loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental problem for appellants is their failure to produce competent evidence supporting these crucial factual allegations.   See Town of Nottingham v. Lee Homes, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1943366\"><a href=\"/opinion/1943366/town-of-nottingham-v-lee-homes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 442 (1978) (\"the party asserting [equitable] estoppel bears the burden of proving it\");   see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 322 (1986) (where nonmovant under Rule 56 would bear the burden of proof at trial, its failure to produce sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment).  Most conspicuously, appellants have yet to proffer the alleged charter membership contracts, presumably accessible to them without resort to discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Nor have they presented any other evidence to rebut appellees' proof, in the form of a sworn affidavit by the Bank's former vice-president, that the Developer did not directly contract with appellants, but leased the health club facilities to a distinct corporate entity (i.e., the Health Club) which in turn entered into club membership contracts with the appellants.  Further, appellants' sole evidence of the alleged agreements and communications between the Bank and the Developer is an affidavit by appellants' attorney, generally relating evidence appellants would present  at trial.  But see, e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] mere promise to produce admissible evidence at trial does not suffice to thwart the summary judgment ax.\").  The affidavit is unaccompanied by documentary support.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(e);  10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2722, at 56-58 (2d ed. 1983) (averments made in Rule 56 affidavit to unattached contracts and documents may be sufficient to establish a triable issue as to their existence, but not as to their terms ).  Nor does the affidavit present any other basis for evaluating the affiant-attorney's personal knowledge of contractual transactions between the Bank and the Developer, the Developer and the Health Club, or the Health Club and appellants.

The magistrate-judge's report resolved no disputed jurisdictional facts.  Instead, it dealt with a pure issue of law-whether FDIC's anticipated defenses were legally sufficient to foreclose remand to the state court.

First, appellants generated no trialworthy factual claim that appellees (by acquiring title to the real property which the Health Club leased from the Developer) became contractual successors of the Health Club, or ever acquired the Health Club's assets or assumed its liabilities.  Second, appellants, as alleged third-party beneficiaries, could not enforce the Health Club membership contracts against appellees, since third-party beneficiaries may sue, but may not be sued, for contract damages.  Third, appellants cited no legal authority orsupporting facts for their novel state-law theory that their charter membership contracts were akin to mechanic's liens;  that is, property interests \"running\" with the land.  Specifically, plaintiffs failed to show that they supplied the Developer with labor or materials, or perfected their alleged \"lien\" as required under New Hampshire law.  Finally, because appellees were not contractually bound to the terms of the Health Club contracts, appellees could not have violated the NHCPA</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Instead, their appellate brief refers to a nine-page memorandum of law in opposition to the Bank's motion to dismiss which appellants submitted to the New Hampshire Superior Court almost three years ago, before FDIC ever removed the case.

The state court premised its ruling on the ground that Count 1 stated a valid claim for contractual successor liability only, not an equitable estoppel or mechanic's lien claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Appellants now concede that their charter memberships cannot meet the literal requirements of a mechanic's lien under New Hampshire law, since appellants neither supplied labor or materials, nor perfected their alleged \"liens.\"  See supra note 5. Appellants present no argumentation or authority which would indicate that perfection is a dispensable requisite to mechanic's lien priority over a duly recorded mortgage lien.  See N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. Sec. 447:10 (1993).  Thus, appellants' Bateman exception claim, see supra at p. 6, fails as a matter of law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Even if they had presented competent Rule 56 evidence on these factual matters, appellants would still face three considerable hurdles on the merits.  See also note 10 infra.  First, unlike all of the aggrieved parties in the cited New Hampshire cases, appellants have not made the threshold showing that the law of any state recognizes health club memberships as \"property\" interests.  The only case appellants cite is wholly unsupportive.   See Silver Hills Country Club v. Sobieski, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></span>, 907 (Cal. 1961) (considering analytically distinct question whether the sales of club memberships were \"securities\" subject to regulation California's Corporate Securities Act)</p>\n        <p>Second, the New Hampshire cases appellants cite involve a narrow and distinctive species of fraud;  namely, omissions and other misleading conduct (e.g., silence, execution of releases, sharing in sale proceeds) by a defendant which lead the party acquiring the property to believe that the defendant neither has nor will assert any claim, superseding title, or competing interest in the property conveyed.   See, e.g., New Hampshire Sav. Bank v. National Rockland Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3555414\"><a href=\"/opinion/3575067/nh-savings-bank-v-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 329 (1945) (estopping executor of decedent owner of passbook savings account, where decedent had made inter vivos transfer of passbook to daughter-in-law, along with a withdrawal form endorsed in blank, and daughter-in-law pledged passbook as collateral for personal loan).  Appellants' promised evidence would not show that the Bank concealed its interest in the Property, nor can appellants plausibly dispute that they were at all times on constructive notice of the Bank's recorded mortgage.</p>\n        <p>Finally, even if the Bank might be estopped from asserting its mortgage and power of sale, appellants offer no explanation as to how such an estoppel would insulate them from the defenses of the Bank's successors-particularly the FDIC with its D'Oench Duhme defense-absent evidence that these grantees knew of the facts giving rise to a bar to the Bank's claim.   See, e.g., InternationalChimney Corp. v. 26 West Spring St. Assocs., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></span>, 934 (App.  Div. 1990) (\"[E]quitable estoppel should be applied with ... even greater caution when sought to be invoked against a subsequent owner.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Nor does the record indicate that appellants ever requested \"a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).   See, e.g., De la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, (1st Cir. 1993) [1994 U.S. App.  LEXIS 1502, at p(1st Cir.  Jan. 31, 1993) ]</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
