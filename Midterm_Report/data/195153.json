United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1029 (1st Cir. 1993).  \n              \n\n          Spanning  a two-week  period in  late February  and\n\nearly  March of  1991,  a  group  of  individuals,  including\n\ndefendants, occupied Rooms 310, 311  and 327 of the Carib Inn\n\nHotel in  Isla Verde, Puerto  Rico.   Two of  the rooms  were\n\nregistered to false names.\n\n          Soon,  the activities of the occupants of all three\n\nrooms  attracted the  attention  of  hotel  employees.    The\n\nhotel's  chief of  security  observed  \"continual\" visits  to\n\noccupants of all  three rooms made by young  people who often\n\ndrove  luxury  cars  and  stayed  for  periods  of about  ten\n\nminutes.  In  a hotel of  225 guest rooms,  the group in  the\n\nthree  rooms received  90% of  all  phone calls  made to  the\n\n                             -3-\n\nhotel.  Moreover,  the group paid their hotel  bills in cash,\n\nusing bundles of small denominations wrapped in rubber bands.\n\nOn a few occasions, the  occupants paid for all three of  the\n\nrooms  together in  amounts  totaling approximately  $300  to\n\n$400.   In addition, a  \"floor supervisor\" in charge  of maid\n\nservice  on defendants' floor at  the hotel saw the occupants\n\nof all three rooms passing frequently among  the three rooms.\n\n          On  March  6,  1991,  the   same  floor  supervisor\n\nobserved two  revolvers on top of a bureau  in Room 327.  She\n\ninformed both the hotel's chief of security and local police,\n\nwho, in turn, contacted agents of the United States Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms  (ATF).   Later that  day, ATF\n\nagents  and local police  officers began surveillance  at the\n\nCarib Inn Hotel.    \n\n          At  approximately 11:00 p.m.  on March 6,  1991 the\n\nsurveilling agents observed defendants Hector Santiago-Alicea\n\n(Santiago-Alicea), Teddy  Leon Ayala (Leon),  Oscar Diaz Cruz\n\n(Diaz)  and Frankie  Nieves-Burgos  (Nieves-Burgos)1 with  an\n\nunidentified man  in the  hotel lobby.   Santiago-Alicea  was\n\nwearing a bulletproof jacket, and the agents noticed a  bulge\n\nunder  the  jacket which  appeared to  be a  gun.   The group\n\nproceeded from the  lobby to the hotel parking  lot where the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Nieves-Burgos,  convicted below, is  not a party  to this\nappeal.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nunidentified  individual, after opening  the trunk of  a car,\n\nopened  a   plastic  bag   inside  the   trunk  and   counted\n\nunidentified  items inside  the bag.   He  handed the  bag to\n\nSantiago-Alicea,  who then showed  the contents to  Leon, who\n\ngave a facial sign of approval  and an affirmative nod of his\n\nhead.\n\n          Later  that  evening,  a  second  unidentified  man\n\narrived  at the  hotel, made  a  call on  the hotel's  \"house\n\nphone,\"  and  was  met shortly  thereafter  in  the lobby  by\n\nNieves-Burgos  and  another  defendant, Pedro  Luis  Ramirez-\n\nRivera  (Ramirez-Rivera).2    After  a  brief   conversation,\n\nNieves-Burgos and Ramirez-Rivera went back upstairs.  Shortly\n\nthereafter  they reappeared  with  Santiago-Alicea, who  then\n\nexchanged packages with the unidentified man.\n\n          On  March 7,  1991,  the  following day,  Santiago-\n\nAlicea was observed waiting in the hotel parking lot, looking\n\nin all directions.  A car pulled up to him and, after a brief\n\nconversation, Santiago-Alicea handed a small paper bag to its\n\ndriver, received money in exchange, counted the money, put it\n\nin his pocket and returned to the hotel. \n\n          On the basis of the foregoing events, ATF and local\n\nlaw enforcement officials  obtained a search warrant  for the\n\nthree hotel rooms.  On that same afternoon of March 7,  1991,\n\n                    \n\n2.  Ramirez-Rivera, convicted below,  is not a party  to this\nappeal.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthey  executed the  warrant.   Upon  entering Room  311, they\n\nfound defendant Catalino  Torres-Maldonado (Torres-Maldonado)\n\nseated  on the  floor talking  on  the phone,  and his  wife,\n\ndefendant  Marilyn Gotay-Colon  (Gotay-Colon), seated  on the\n\nsofa.  Nieves-Burgos and Ramirez-Rivera were stretched out on\n\nseparate  beds  in   the  room,  clad  only   in  underpants.\n\nSantiago-Alicea was seated on the end of one of the beds.    \n\n          Upon  searching the  room,  the  agents found  that\n\nGotay-Colon's  purse contained cocaine in a plastic bag which\n\nwas marked with a picture of a unicorn.  Her purse  also held\n\napproximately $400  in cash in  a bundle secured by  a rubber\n\nband.  In  a zippered, opaque tote  bag on the sofa  on which\n\nGotay-Colon was seated,  the agents found $2000 in  cash in a\n\nbundle,  again  secured  by  a  rubber  band,  and  a  loaded\n\nsemiautomatic pistol.  \n\n          On a  night table in  the room, the agents  found a\n\nplastic bag containing cocaine, approximately $1500  in cash,\n\nbrown paper bags, and a homemade pipe used for smoking drugs.\n\nIn the  room's  closet was  the  bulletproof jacket  seen  on\n\nSantiago-Alicea the night before.   Under the bed, the agents\n\nfound empty plastic bags labeled with a picture of a unicorn,\n\nalong with plastic straw-and-spoon type implements typical of\n\nthe sort  used to  cut and package  drugs for  re-sale.   The\n\nagents also found razor blades, ordinary playing cards, and a\n\nstapler,  all of which  can be used  to package  drugs.  They\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nalso found  beepers and  cellular telephones.   Finally,  the\n\nagents discovered keys to a  gray Buick, which would later be\n\nsearched by the agents.\n\n          Rooms 310 and 327, though unoccupied at the time of\n\nthe  search,  also contained  drugs  and drug-related  items.\n\nRoom  310 contained  fifty-five  packets  of  cocaine,  again\n\nmarked with  a unicorn, which were found in a brown paper bag\n\nhidden in a roll-away bed or sofabed.  There was also a small\n\namount of narcotics in an ashtray and a pipe used for smoking\n\ndrugs.  The  search of Room 327 turned up a pillowcase hidden\n\nabove  a \"dropped  ceiling\" in  the bathroom.   It  contained\n\nsixteen brown  paper bags, each  of which, in turn,  held 100\n\nsmall packets marked with the  unicorn symbol and filled with\n\ncocaine.   Under a  sofa, the agents found  a bullet that fit\n\nthe semiautomatic pistol found in Room 311.\n\n          Later that day, Leon and Diaz, who had been present\n\nfor one of the transactions the night before, but who had not\n\nbeen present  during the search  of Room 311, arrived  at the\n\nhotel.     Leon  exclaimed,  \"Oh,  my  god,  they  busted  my\n\npeople.\"3  The  agents asked Leon  and Diaz if they  knew the\n\noccupants of  Room 311.    They replied  in the  affirmative.\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  parties agree that  the exclamation was  in Spanish,\nnot English.  One report stated that the exclamation was more\nclosely translated as \"They busted the people.\"  Nonetheless,\n                                      \nthe officer who allegedly heard the remark testified at trial\nthat  the  exclamation  was,  \"Oh, my  god,  they  busted  my\npeople.\"\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nLeon was  carrying over $6700 in cash and  a key to Room 310.\n\nDiaz had over $1400 in cash anda hotel receipt for Room 327. \n\n          The  agents subsequently searched  two cars  in the\n\nhotel parking lot.  In the first car, a green Ford  LTD, they\n\nfound  a  loaded   .357  six-shot  revolver,  along   with  a\n\nphotograph  of  Nieves-Burgos  and  a  parking  receipt  with\n\nNieves-Burgos'  fingerprint on it.   The second  car searched\n\nwas  the gray  Buick, keys  to which  had been  found in  the\n\nsearch of Room 311.  In the  Buick, the agents found a loaded\n\nnine  millimeter pistol, with  additional ammunition  and one\n\n\"spent\" or fired bullet cartridge.   Though the Buick was not\n\nregistered in Santiago-Alicea's name, the registration to the\n\ncar was found in Santiago-Alicea's wallet.\n\n          Defendants were tried  together.  Torres-Maldonado,\n\nGotay-Colon,  Santiago-Alicea,  Leon,   and  Diaz  were   all\n\nconvicted of  conspiring to  possess cocaine  with intent  to\n\ndistribute,  and  of  possession of  cocaine  with  intent to\n\ndistribute.  See 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1), 846.4   Gotay-Colon\n                \n\nwas  also convicted  of possession  of  cocaine based  on the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Section  841(a)(1) states in relevant part that \"it shall\nbe unlawful for  any person knowingly or intentionally  . . .\nto  manufacture, distribute,  or  dispense,  or possess  with\nintent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a  controlled\nsubstance.\"\n     Section  846  states,   \"Any  person  who   attempts  or\nconspires  to commit any  offense defined in  this subchapter\nshall be subject  to the same  penalties as those  prescribed\nfor the  offense, the commission  of which was the  object of\nthe attempt or conspiracy.\"\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\namount found  in her  purse.  See  21 U.S.C.    844(a).5   In\n                                 \n\naddition, Torres-Maldonado,  Gotay-Colon and  Santiago-Alicea\n\nwere convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a\n\ndrug offense.  See 18  U.S.C.   924(c)(1).6  Defendants raise\n                  \n\nvarious grounds for appeal.  We address them in turn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.

We  have recently stated that \"the culpability\n\nof   a   defendant's   presence  hinges   upon   whether  the\n\ncircumstances  fairly imply  participatory  involvement.   In\n\nother words, a defendant's `mere presence' argument will fail\n\nin situations where the `mere' is lacking.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nEcheverri,  982 F.2d  675, 678  (1st Cir.  1993).   While the\n         \n\ngovernment's  evidence  against Torres-Maldonado  and  Gotay-\n\nColon  is less  abundant than  its  evidence against  several\n\nother defendants, it  is nonetheless sufficient to  support a\n\nfinding  of  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the\n\nconspiracy and possession counts.  \n\n          Hotel   personnel  testified   that  both   Torres-\n\nMaldonado and Gotay-Colon were associated with the group that\n\noccupied Rooms  310, 311  and 327.   A front  desk supervisor\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nidentified  Torres-Maldonado as a member of the group who had\n\nbeen  present when  cash  payments were  made  for the  three\n\nrooms, and  the  floor supervisor  mentioned above  testified\n\nthat  she  observed  Gotay-Colon  passing  between  the three\n\nrooms.   She recalled  a specific  instance when  Gotay-Colon\n\nwent to Room 327 with Santiago-Alicea.\n\n          In  addition,  drugs  and drug  paraphernalia  were\n\nlying  in open  view  in  Room 311  at  the  time of  Torres-\n\nMaldonado's and Gotay-Colon's  arrest.  Torres-Maldonado  was\n\ntalking on  the phone  when the agents  entered, allowing  an\n\ninference  that  he  and  Gotay-Colon  were  more  than  mere\n\nvisitors.   The cocaine  found in Gotay-Colon's  purse, which\n\nwas packaged  in a  bag bearing  the unicorn  symbol, further\n\nsupports  that inference.    Finally,  the  bundle  of  cash,\n\nsecured  characteristically  with  a  rubber  band,  provides\n\nfurther evidence linking the couple to the group in the hotel\n\nand to  drug-related activity.   In sum, there  is sufficient\n\nrecord evidence from  which a reasonable jury  could conclude\n\nbeyond  a reasonable  doubt that Torres-Maldonado  and Gotay-\n\nColon  were guilty  of both  conspiracy  and possession  with\n\nintent to distribute the drugs  found at the hotel, and that,\n\non the basis of the drugs found in her purse, Gotay-Colon was\n\nguilty of simple possession.\n\n          Even  more  compelling  evidence,  both direct  and\n\ncircumstantial,  supports   the  conspiracy   and  possession\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nconvictions  of  the other  defendants  in  this  case.   For\n\nexample, a jury  could reasonably infer that  Leon, Diaz, and\n\nSantiago-Alicea were observed  by ATF agents making  the very\n\ndrug   transactions  which  serve  as  the  basis  for  their\n\nconspiracy  and   possession  convictions.     Therefore,  we\n\nconclude that sufficient evidence supports those convictions.\n\n     3.  The Firearms Convictions\n                                 \n\n          Santiago-Alicea,  Torres-Maldonado and  Gotay-Colon\n\nalso  challenge  the sufficiency  of the  evidence supporting\n\ntheir convictions  under 18  U.S.C.   924(c)(1)  for using  a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug offense.\n\n          a.  Santiago-Alicea\n                             \n\n          Santiago-Alicea was observed wearing a bullet-proof\n\nvest with a protruding bulge beneath it.  So clad, he engaged\n\nin what appeared to be a drug  deal in the parking lot of the\n\nHotel Carib Inn.   Using the same standard  of review recited\n\nabove, we  conclude that a  reasonable jury could  have found\n\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt that the bulge was one of the guns\n\nfound  in the drug raid, and that Santiago-Alicea was \"using\"\n\nthe gun,  as that term  is used in section  924(c)(1), during\n\nand in  relation to a  drug offense.  Accordingly,  we affirm\n\nhis conviction.\n\n          b.

The  government does  not argue,  nor  does the  evidence\nsupport an inference, that Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's\nconvictions  under Section 924(c)  could be supported  by the\ngun found during the searches of the two cars in this case.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          The government's  evidence does not  establish that\n\neither  Torres-Maldonado  or Gotay-Colon  had  any  direct or\n\nactual possessory  interest in  the firearm in  the bag.   In\n\nfact, one government witness, who  had been asked to identify\n\nparticular government exhibits, was also asked to state which\n\ndefendant  appeared to  own or  control each  exhibit.   Upon\n\nidentifying  the bag which  contained the  gun at  issue, the\n\nwitness replied that  it was linked to \"[n]o  defendant.\"  No\n\nfurther  evidence  in the  record tends  to show  that either\n\nTorres-Maldonado   or  Gotay-Colon   ever  exercised   actual\n\npossession over the gun or the bag.  The      evidence     of\n\nconstructive  possession  is  equally  scant.    Constructive\n\npossession exists when a person  \"knowingly has the power and\n\nintention at  a given time  to exercise dominion  and control\n\nover  an object, either directly  or through others.\"  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Unlike  the\n\nevidence against the other  defendants who are party  to this\n\nappeal, the evidence against Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon\n\nfailed  to  establish  any   connection  between  these   two\n\ndefendants,  on   one  hand,  and  those   drug  distribution\n\ntransactions which appeared to involve guns, on the other.  \n\n          When  viewed in  the light  most  favorable to  the\n\ngovernment, the  evidence shows  that only  one group of  the\n\ndefendants, which did not include either Torres-Maldonado  or\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nGotay-Colon, was involved  in armed drug deals in  and around\n\nthe hotel.  Additional evidence  linking Torres-Maldonado and\n\nGotay-Colon  to  the  group  generally  falls  far  short  of\n                                      \n\nestablishing that either defendant knew of or participated in\n\nthe armed  drug deals.

Natanel,  938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st  Cir. 1991), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 986  (1992)).  Moreover, the Supreme Court\n      \n\nhas recently  stated that  \"a district  court should grant  a\n\nseverance under Rule 14 only if  there is a serious risk that\n\na joint trial would compromise  a specific trial right of one\n\nof the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable\n\njudgment about guilt or innocence.\"  Zafiro v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n113 S.  Ct. 933,  938  (1993).    Finally,  we have  recently\n\nreiterated that where,  as here, a defendant  seeks severance\n\nin order to secure the  testimony of a codefendant, s/he must\n\ndemonstrate,  inter alia, that the codefendant \"`will in fact\n                        \n\ntestify if  the cases  are severed.'\"   See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nNason, 9 F.3d 155, 158 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 1984)).  \n          \n\n          Torres-Maldonado and  Gotay-Colon sought  severance\n\nin order to  secure Santiago-Alicea's testimony.   Aside from\n\nan unsubstantiated  blanket  claim  of  prejudice,  Santiago-\n\nAlicea's  initial  offer  to  provide  exculpatory  testimony\n\nformed the sole basis  for Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's\n               \n\nmotion for severance.  Thus, even by the reasoning set out in\n\nTorres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's own  motion for severance,\n\nonce  Santiago-Alicea  withdrew  his offer  to  testify  at a\n\nseparate  trial, he  also withdrew  the entire  basis of  his\n\ncodefendants' severance motion.   Because the  district court\n\nwas given no additional justification for ordering a separate\n\ntrial, we find no abuse in its denial of Torres-Maldonado and\n\nGotay-Colon's severance motion.\n\n          Moreover,  nothing  at  the joint  trial  prevented\n\nTorres-Maldonado  and Gotay-Colon  from  putting on  evidence\n\nfrom  sources   other  than  Santiago-Alicea   in  order   to\n                           \n\ncorroborate their contention  that they were  merely visiting\n\nthe hotel with regard to car payments.  In fact,  one witness\n\nso  testified.    In sum,  Torres-Maldonado  and  Gotay-Colon\n\nfailed to establish  that a joint trial  would compromise any\n\n\"specific trial  right,\" see Zafiro,  113 S. Ct. at  938, nor\n                                   \n\ndid  they make  the \"strong  showing  of evident  prejudice,\"\n\nO'Bryant,  998  F.2d  at  25,  which  is required  to  obtain\n        \n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nseverance.  Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying their motion. \n\n     2.  Leon\n             \n\n          Leon  sought  severance   based  upon  the  opening\n\nremarks  of  counsel  for  one  of  his  codefendants,  Pedro\n\nPanzardi Fuentes (Panzardi), who was acquitted below.  During\n\nhis  opening, Panzardi's counsel  stated, inter alia,  \"It is\n                                                    \n\nnot my job to be a prosecutor in this case.  So I don't  have\n\nto prove who  did it.  It  is the government's duty  to prove\n\nour client  guilty beyond  a reasonable doubt.   But  we will\n\nprove  to  you,   from  the  same  evidence   the  government\n\ncollected, that  during a  period  of time,  starting at  the\n\nbeginning of  the year,  the group  which was  trafficking in\n\ndrugs was . . . using the name Panzardi from those days.\"\n\n          Leon  understood  these   remarks  and  others   in\n\nPanzardi's opening statement to mean that Panzardi planned to\n\nbring evidence  which would  at once  aid  the government  in\n\nproving  its  case against  all of  the other  defendants and\n\nexonerate  Panzardi.   Leon  unsuccessfully sought  severance\n\nbased upon potential prejudice from Panzardi's trial tactics.\n\nUpon careful review, we find no error in the district court's\n\ndenial of this motion.\n\n          The sole basis  for Leon's  severance motion,  both\n\nbelow and  on  appeal,  has been  the  opening  statement  of\n\nPanzardi's   counsel.    A  close  reading  of  that  opening\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nstatement  shows  that  it was  carefully,  indeed  artfully,\n\nworded  by  Panzardi's counsel  to emphasize  that Panzardi's\n\ninnocence would be proven irrespective of the guilt of any of\n                                      \n\nhis codefendants.10   Moreover,  Leon points  to no  evidence\n\nat trial which was introduced or referred to by Panzardi that\n\ninculpated Leon or any of the other defendants.\n\n          The strongest  possible basis for Leon's  motion to\n\nsever   is  his  view   that  Panzardi's  defense   would  be\n\nantagonistic  to  his  own.    As we  have  recently  stated,\n\nhowever, \"[t]he fact that two defendants  assert antagonistic\n\ndefenses  does  not,  per  se,  require  severance,  even  if\n                             \n\ndefendants  are  hostile or  attempt  to cast  blame  on each\n\nother.\"   United States v.  McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12,  18 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1992).  Rather, \"the antagonism in defenses must be such\n\nthat if  the jury  believes one defense,  it is  compelled to\n\nconvict the other defendant.\"  United States  v. Angiulo, 897\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1169,  1195  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied,  498  U.S. 845\n                                             \n\n(1990).  Leon  has made no  such showing in  this case.   The\n\njury could have readily believed Panzardi's argument that his\n\nname  was used  by  a  group  of people  at  the  hotel,  and\n\n                    \n\n10.  For  example, Panzardi's  counsel referred  to a  \"group\nwhich   was  trafficking   drugs\"   without  asserting   that\nPanzardi's codefendants  actually comprised  that group.   In\nfact, counsel concluded his opening statement by arguing that\nthe  government's poor investigation  had led \"to  a very bad\ninvestigation and possibly  to the acquittal of more than one\n                                                             \nperson in this  case.  Hopefully, my client  and whoever else\n                                                             \nis innocent.\" (emphasis supplied).   \n           \n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nnonetheless  have  acquitted  Leon.11    In  sum,  Panzardi's\n\nopening  remarks  did  not  amount to  a  strong  showing  of\n\nprejudice  to Leon, nor were they subsequently accompanied by\n\nprejudicial  tactics at  trial.   Accordingly,  the  district\n\ncourt did not err in denying Leon's motion for severance.\n\nC.  Evidence Acquired Incident to the Warrantless Arrest\n                                                        \n\n          Both  Leon and Diaz  argue that they  were arrested\n\nwithout probable cause,  and that therefore the  items seized\n\nfrom  their  persons  during their  arrest  should  have been\n\nsuppressed.  Again, we disagree. \n\n          In   the  context   of   warrantless  arrests,   as\n\nelsewhere,  \"[p]robable cause must  be evaluated in  light of\n\nthe totality of circumstances.\"  United States v. Uricoechea-\n                                                             \n\nCasallas, 946  F.2d 162, 165  (1st Cir. 1991).   Moreover, in\n        \n\norder to establish  that probable cause  existed for such  an\n\narrest, the government \"need not present the quantum of proof\n\nnecessary  to convict.\"    Id.   See  also  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMorris,  977  F.2d 677,  684  (1st Cir.  1992)  (same), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  113 S. Ct.  1588 (1993); United  States v. Figueroa,\n                                                            \n\n818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir. 1987) (same).  Rather,  it need\n\nonly  show that,  at the  time of  the arrest, the  facts and\n\ncircumstances known to the arresting officers were sufficient\n\n                    \n\n11.  For instance, the jury was  free to reason that Leon was\nnever sufficiently identified as a member of the group at the\nhotel, or  that, while  he was  a  member of  the group,  the\ngovernment's  evidence did not  sufficiently link him  to the\ndrug transactions at issue.\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nto warrant a  prudent person in believing that  the defendant\n\nhad committed  or was committing  an offense.  Id.;  see also\n                                                             \n\nBeck v. Ohio,  379 U.S. 89, 91  (1964).  The arrests  of Leon\n            \n\nand Diaz clearly met these standards.\n\n          Both Leon and Diaz had been observed on the evening\n\nprior to their arrest engaging in what appeared to  be a drug\n\ndeal.  They were apprehended  the following day returning  to\n\nan area  of the  hotel which had  recently been  searched and\n\nwhich yielded large quantities of  drugs, drug paraphernalia,\n\nand  firearms.  Finally, they admitted knowing members of the\n\ngroup who had  been arrested earlier in  the day.  In  total,\n\nthe  circumstances of this  case indicate that  the arresting\n\nofficers had  probable cause  to believe  that both  Leon and\n\nDiaz had committed or were committing an offense.  Therefore,\n\ntheir arrest was  lawful.  Moreover,  it is well  established\n\nthat  \"[i]f an arrest  is lawful, the  arresting officers are\n\nentitled to  search  the individual  apprehended pursuant  to\n\nthat  arrest.\"     Uricoechea-Casallas,  946   F.2d  at  165.\n                                      \n\nAccordingly,  the district court did not err in admitting the\n\nevidence recovered in that search.\n\n          We have carefully considered  all defendants' other\n\nclaims and find them to be without merit.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  convictions  of\n\nTorres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon under 18  U.S.C.   924(c)(1)\n\nare vacated.\n           \n\n          All other convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n",

United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1029 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spanning a two-week period in late February and early March of 1991, a group of individuals, including defendants, occupied Rooms 310, 311 and 327 of the Carib Inn Hotel in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico.  Two of the rooms were registered to false names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon, the activities of the occupants of all three rooms attracted the attention of hotel employees.  The hotel's chief of security observed \"continual\" visits to occupants of all three rooms made by young people who often drove luxury cars and stayed for periods of about ten minutes.  In a hotel of 225 guest rooms, the group in the three rooms received 90% of all phone calls made to the hotel.  Moreover, the group paid their hotel bills in cash, using bundles of small denominations wrapped in rubber bands.  On a few occasions, the occupants paid for all three of the rooms together in amounts totaling approximately $300 to $400.  In addition, a \"floor supervisor\" in charge of maid service on defendants' floor at the hotel saw the occupants of all three rooms passing frequently among the three rooms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 1991, the same floor supervisor observed two revolvers on top of a bureau in Room 327.  She informed both the hotel's chief of security and local police, who, in turn, contacted agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  Later that day, ATF agents and local police officers began surveillance at the Carib Inn Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 11:00 p.m. on March 6, 1991 the surveilling agents observed defendants Hector Santiago-Alicea (Santiago-Alicea), Teddy Leon Ayala (Leon), Oscar Diaz Cruz (Diaz) and Frankie Nieves-Burgos (Nieves-Burgos)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with an unidentified man in the hotel lobby.  Santiago-Alicea was wearing a bulletproof jacket, and the agents noticed a bulge under the jacket which appeared to be a gun.  The group proceeded from the lobby to the hotel parking lot where the unidentified individual, after opening the trunk of a car, opened a plastic bag inside the trunk and counted unidentified items inside the bag.  He handed the bag to Santiago-Alicea, who then showed the contents to Leon, who gave a facial sign of approval and an affirmative nod of his head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, a second unidentified man arrived at the hotel, made a call on the hotel's \"house phone,\" and was met shortly thereafter in the lobby by Nieves-Burgos and another defendant, Pedro Luis Ramirez-Rivera (Ramirez-Rivera).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After a brief conversation, Nieves-Burgos and Ramirez- Rivera went back upstairs.  Shortly thereafter they reappeared with Santiago-Alicea, who then exchanged packages with the unidentified man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 1991, the following day, Santiago-Alicea was observed waiting in the hotel parking lot, looking in all directions.  A car pulled up to him and, after a brief conversation, Santiago-Alicea handed a small paper bag to its driver, received money in exchange, counted the money, put it in his pocket and returned to the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing events, ATF and local law enforcement officials obtained a search warrant for the three hotel rooms.  On that same afternoon of March 7, 1991, they executed the warrant.  Upon entering Room 311, they found defendant Catalino Torres-Maldonado (Torres-Maldonado) seated on the floor talking on the phone, and his wife, defendant Marilyn Gotay-Colon (Gotay-Colon), seated on the sofa.  Nieves-Burgos and Ramirez-Rivera were stretched out on separate beds in the room, clad only in underpants.  Santiago-Alicea was seated on the end of one of the beds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon searching the room, the agents found that Gotay-Colon's purse contained cocaine in a plastic bag which was marked with a picture of a unicorn.  Her purse also held approximately $400 in cash in a bundle secured by a rubber band.  In a zippered, opaque tote bag on the sofa on which Gotay-Colon was seated, the agents found $2000 in cash in a bundle, again secured by a rubber band, and a loaded semiautomatic pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a night table in the room, the agents found a plastic bag containing cocaine, approximately $1500 in cash, brown paper bags, and a homemade pipe used for smoking drugs.  In the room's closet was the bulletproof jacket seen on Santiago-Alicea the night before.  Under the bed, the agents found empty plastic bags labeled with a picture of a unicorn, along with plastic straw-and-spoon type implements typical of the sort used to cut and package drugs for re-sale.  The agents also found razor blades, ordinary playing cards, and a stapler, all of which can be used to package drugs.  They also found beepers and cellular telephones.  Finally, the agents discovered keys to a gray Buick, which would later be searched by the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rooms 310 and 327, though unoccupied at the time of the search, also contained drugs and drug-related items.  Room 310 contained fifty-five packets of cocaine, again marked with a unicorn, which were found in a brown paper bag hidden in a roll-away bed or sofabed.  There was also a small amount of narcotics in an ashtray and a pipe used for smoking drugs.  The search of Room 327 turned up a pillowcase hidden above a \"dropped ceiling\" in the bathroom.  It contained sixteen brown paper bags, each of which, in turn, held 100 small packets marked with the unicorn symbol and filled with cocaine.  Under a sofa, the agents found a bullet that fit the semiautomatic pistol found in Room 311.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Leon and Diaz, who had been present for one of the transactions the night before, but who had not been present during the search of Room 311, arrived at the hotel.  Leon exclaimed, \"Oh, my god, they busted my people.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The agents asked Leon and Diaz if they knew the occupants of Room 311.  They replied in the affirmative.  Leon was carrying over $6700 in cash and a key to Room 310.  Diaz had over $1400 in cash and a hotel receipt for Room 327.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents subsequently searched two cars in the hotel parking lot.  In the first car, a green Ford LTD, they found a loaded .357 six-shot revolver, along with a photograph of Nieves-Burgos and a parking receipt with Nieves-Burgos' fingerprint on it.  The second car searched was the gray Buick, keys to which had been found in the search of Room 311.  In the Buick, the agents found a loaded nine millimeter pistol, with additional ammunition and one \"spent\" or fired bullet cartridge.  Though the Buick was not registered in Santiago-Alicea's name, the registration to the car was found in Santiago-Alicea's wallet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were tried together.  Torres-Maldonado, Gotay-Colon, Santiago-Alicea, Leon, and Diaz were all convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, and of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Gotay-Colon was also convicted of possession of cocaine based on the amount found in her purse.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In addition, Torres-Maldonado, Gotay-Colon and Santiago-Alicea were convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug offense.

We address them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[o]ur task is to review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.\"  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031.   Moreover, \"[w]e do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"  United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1011 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Conspiracy and Possession with Intent to Distribute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon claim that the evidence at trial showed no more than their \"mere presence\" at the hotel.  We have recently stated that \"the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.  In other words, a defendant's 'mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the 'mere' is lacking.\"  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.1993).  While the government's evidence against Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon is less abundant than its evidence against several other defendants, it is nonetheless sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to the conspiracy and possession counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotel personnel testified that both Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon were associated with the group that occupied Rooms 310, 311 and 327.  A front desk supervisor identified Torres-Maldonado as a member of the group who had been present when cash payments were made for the three rooms, and the floor supervisor mentioned above testified that she observed Gotay-Colon passing between the three rooms.  She recalled a specific instance when Gotay-Colon went to Room 327 with Santiago-Alicea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, drugs and drug paraphernalia were lying in open view in Room 311 at the time of Torres-Maldonado's and Gotay-Colon's arrest.  Torres-Maldonado was talking on the phone when the agents entered, allowing an inference that he and Gotay-Colon were more than mere visitors.  The cocaine found in Gotay-Colon's purse, which was packaged in a bag bearing the unicorn symbol, further supports that inference.  Finally, the bundle of cash, secured characteristically with a rubber band, provides further evidence linking the couple to the group in the hotel and to drug-related activity.  In sum, there is sufficient record evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon were guilty of both conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute the drugs found at the hotel, and that, on the basis of the drugs found in her purse, Gotay-Colon was guilty of simple possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more compelling evidence, both direct and circumstantial, supports the conspiracy and possession convictions of the other defendants in this case.  For example, a jury could reasonably infer that Leon, Diaz, and Santiago-Alicea were observed by ATF agents making the very drug transactions which serve as the basis for their conspiracy and possession convictions.  Therefore, we conclude that sufficient evidence supports those convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Firearms Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Alicea, Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>a. Santiago-Alicea</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Alicea was observed wearing a bullet-proof vest with a protruding bulge beneath it.  So clad, he engaged in what appeared to be a drug deal in the parking lot of the Hotel Carib Inn.  Using the same standard of review recited above, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the bulge was one of the guns found in the drug raid, and that Santiago-Alicea was \"using\" the gun, as that term is used in section 924(c)(1), during and in relation to a drug offense.  Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>b. Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there are several possible grounds upon which section 924(c)(1) liability may rest, the evidence against Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon is insufficient to support a section 924(c)(1) conviction under any applicable theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(1) Pinkerton Liability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that, although members of a conspiracy may be held liable for substantive crimes committed by a coconspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, see, e.g., Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-47, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1183-84, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946);  United States v. Barker Steel Co., 985 F.2d 1123, 1128-29 (1st Cir.1993), the jury in this case was not so instructed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On appeal, we will not infer either that the jury found guilt based on a theory upon which it was not instructed, or that the jury would have found guilt had it been given a Pinkerton instruction.  See United States v. Labat, 905 F.2d 18, 23 (2d Cir.1990) (citing Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 618, 69 S.Ct. 766, 769, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949));  United States v. Raffone, 693 F.2d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.1982) (similar), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 931, 103 S.Ct. 2094, 77 L.Ed.2d 303 (1983).  Accordingly, we decline to affirm defendants' firearms convictions on Pinkerton grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(2) Actual or Constructive Possession</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues essentially that the physical proximity of Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon to the gun found in the tote bag at the time of the arrest is sufficient to support an inference that they \"used\" or were prepared to use the gun in a drug transaction for section 924(c)(1) purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a weapon need not be \"brandished, displayed, or discharged\" in order to sustain a conviction under section 924(c)(1).  See United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 983 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993);  United States v. Plummer, 964 F.2d 1251, 1255 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 350, 121 L.Ed.2d 265 (1992).  Nonetheless, \"there must be some facilitative nexus between the weapon and the criminal activity.\"  Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 983.   Moreover, in order to establish that a defendant \"used\" a firearm for purposes of section 924(c)(1), \"the government must prove that the defendant actually or constructively possessed it.\"  United States v. Harrison, 931 F.2d 65, 71 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 408, 116 L.Ed.2d 356 (1991).  See also United States v. Long, 905 F.2d 1572, 1576 &amp; n. 6 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 948, 111 S.Ct. 365, 112 L.Ed.2d 328 (1990).  In this case, we find neither actual nor constructive possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence does not establish that either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon had any direct or actual possessory interest in the firearm in the bag.  In fact, one government witness, who had been asked to identify particular government exhibits, was also asked to state which defendant appeared to own or control each exhibit.  Upon identifying the bag which contained the gun at issue, the witness replied that it was linked to \"[n]o defendant.\"   No further evidence in the record tends to show that either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon ever exercised actual possession over the gun or the bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of constructive possession is equally scant.  Constructive possession exists when a person \"knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object, either directly or through others.\"  United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1164 (1st Cir.1993) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  Unlike the evidence against the other defendants who are party to this appeal, the evidence against Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon failed to establish any connection between these two defendants, on one hand, and those drug distribution transactions which appeared to involve guns, on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that only one group of the defendants, which did not include either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon, was involved in armed drug deals in and around the hotel.  Additional evidence linking Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon to the group generally falls far short of establishing that either defendant knew of or participated in the armed drug deals.  Cf. United States v. Matthews, 942 F.2d 779, 783-84 (10th Cir.1991) (affirming drug conspiracy and possession convictions and reversing conviction under section 924(c)(1) where the sole explanation for the presence of the weapons was to provide conspirators with protection on drug-selling \"excursions,\" and where evidence showed that defendant had not participated in any such excursions);  United States v. Bruce, 939 F.2d 1053, 1055-56 (D.C.Cir.1991) (reversing conviction under section 924(c)(1) despite gun's presence in an apartment containing drugs, on grounds that gun's intended use was \"for defendant's protection at the time and place of subsequent distribution\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was no additional evidence tending to show that either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon exercised any \"dominion and control\" over any firearms, see, e.g., Garcia, 983 F.2d at 1164, that they had any \"appreciable ability to guide the destiny\" of firearms, see, e.g., United States v. Staten, 581 F.2d 878, 883 (D.C.Cir.1978), or that these defendants ever had \"some stake in, some power over\" the firearms found, see, e.g., United States v. Pardo, 636 F.2d 535, 549 (D.C.Cir.1980).  Cf. Matthews, 942 F.2d at 783-84 (reversing section 924(c)(1) conviction where there was no evidence \"that [defendant] intended to avail himself of the firearms in question\");  United States v. Feliz-Cordero, 859 F.2d 250, 254 (2d Cir.1988) (holding that a loaded gun \"found in the same room as drug paraphernalia during the course of a search pursuant to a warrant\" was, standing alone, insufficient to support a conviction under section 924(c)(1)).  We conclude that there was insufficient evidence to allow a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon actually or constructively possessed a firearm for purposes of section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>(3) Aiding and Abetting</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given such a lack of evidence of actual or constructive possession, the firearms convictions of Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon may stand, if at all, only upon a theory that they aided and abetted in the use of the gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The government's evidence, however, is insufficient to uphold a conviction on an aiding and abetting theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled in the case law interpreting section 924(c)(1) that an accomplice \"must have known to a practical certainty that the principal would be [using] a gun.\"  United States v. Powell, 929 F.2d 724, 728 (D.C.Cir.1991).  See also United States v. Williams, 985 F.2d 749, 756 (5th Cir.)  (\"Because the evidence does not support an inference that [nonpossessing defendants] knew the gun was available to [possessing codefendant], the evidence is insufficient to support [nonpossessing defendants'] convictions on [a section 924(c)(1) ] count.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993);  United States v. Nelson, 733 F.2d 364, 371 (5th Cir.)  (\"[W]e believe that in order to convict [defendant] on the theory that [coconspirator] aided and abetted [defendant], the government had to prove that [defendant] knew that [coconspirator] was carrying a firearm while the latter was carrying out the directions of the former.\"), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 937, 105 S.Ct. 341, 83 L.Ed.2d 276 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon knew of the use of the gun at any time.  As noted above, while it is clear that Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon had some ties to the group at the hotel, there is no evidence that they were involved in, or knew of, that part of the group's activities which involved guns.  In addition, given that the gun was concealed in a tote bag when the officers entered the room, there is no evidence that either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon knew of the gun's presence at the time of the arrest.  Thus, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the section 924(c)(1) convictions of either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon on a theory of aiding and abetting.  Cf. United States v. Thomas, 987 F.2d 697, 701-02 (11th Cir.1993) (reversing section 924(c)(1) conviction where nothing in the government's case linked defendant to gun possessed by a codefendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, no evidence links either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon to the gun in the zippered bag, to the armed drug transactions or even to the bullet-proof vest found in the closet of Room 311.  Given this dearth of evidence connecting either of these defendants to any firearm in this case, we reverse their convictions under section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Severance</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon filed a joint motion for severance.  Attached to the motion was an affidavit from codefendant Santiago-Alicea, who stated that he was willing to testify at a separate trial that Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon were \"unaware\" of any activities related to drugs or firearms, and that the couple had merely come to the Carib Inn Hotel in order to pick up money that Santiago-Alicea owed on a car that he had purchased from Gotay-Colon's brother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, a magistrate judge recommended that severance be granted.  Santiago-Alicea, however, after conferring additionally with counsel, subsequently withdrew his offer to testify at a separate trial, whereupon the district court denied the motion for severance.  Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon appeal the order denying their severance motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that \"a trial judge has 'considerable latitude' in deciding severance questions and that the judge's resolution of them 'will be overturned only if that wide discretion is plainly abused.' \"  United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992)).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has recently stated that \"a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\"  Zafiro v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 933, 938, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993).  Finally, we have recently reiterated that where, as here, a defendant seeks severance in order to secure the testimony of a codefendant, s/he must demonstrate, inter alia, that the codefendant \" 'will in fact testify if the cases are severed.' \"   See United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 158 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon sought severance in order to secure Santiago-Alicea's testimony.  Aside from an unsubstantiated blanket claim of prejudice, Santiago-Alicea's initial offer to provide exculpatory testimony formed the sole basis for Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's motion for severance.  Thus, even by the reasoning set out in Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's own motion for severance, once Santiago-Alicea withdrew his offer to testify at a separate trial, he also withdrew the entire basis of his codefendants' severance motion.  Because the district court was given no additional justification for ordering a separate trial, we find no abuse in its denial of Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's severance motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, nothing at the joint trial prevented Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon from putting on evidence from sources other than Santiago-Alicea in order to corroborate their contention that they were merely visiting the hotel with regard to car payments.  In fact, one witness so testified.  In sum, Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon failed to establish that a joint trial would compromise any \"specific trial right,\" see Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 938, nor did they make the \"strong showing of evident prejudice,\" O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25, which is required to obtain severance.  Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying their motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Leon</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leon sought severance based upon the opening remarks of counsel for one of his codefendants, Pedro Panzardi Fuentes (Panzardi), who was acquitted below.  During his opening, Panzardi's counsel stated, inter alia, \"It is not my job to be a prosecutor in this case.  So I don't have to prove who did it.  It is the government's duty to prove our client guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  But we will prove to you, from the same evidence the government collected, that during a period of time, starting at the beginning of the year, the group which was trafficking in drugs was ... using the name Panzardi from those days.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leon understood these remarks and others in Panzardi's opening statement to mean that Panzardi planned to bring evidence which would at once aid the government in proving its case against all of the other defendants and exonerate Panzardi.  Leon unsuccessfully sought severance based upon potential prejudice from Panzardi's trial tactics.  Upon careful review, we find no error in the district court's denial of this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole basis for Leon's severance motion, both below and on appeal, has been the opening statement of Panzardi's counsel.  A close reading of that opening statement shows that it was carefully, indeed artfully, worded by Panzardi's counsel to emphasize that Panzardi's innocence would be proven irrespective of the guilt of any of his codefendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, Leon points to no evidence at trial which was introduced or referred to by Panzardi that inculpated Leon or any of the other defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest possible basis for Leon's motion to sever is his view that Panzardi's defense would be antagonistic to his own.  As we have recently stated, however, \"[t]he fact that two defendants assert antagonistic defenses does not, per se, require severance, even if defendants are hostile or attempt to cast blame on each other.\"  United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1992).  Rather, \"the antagonism in defenses must be such that if the jury believes one defense, it is compelled to convict the other defendant.\"  United States v.

Rather, it need only show that, at the time of the arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officers were sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.  Id.;  see also Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).

Finally, they admitted knowing members of the group who had been arrested earlier in the day.  In total, the circumstances of this case indicate that the arresting officers had probable cause to believe that both Leon and Diaz had committed or were committing an offense.

Moreover, it is well established that \"[i]f an arrest is lawful, the arresting officers are entitled to search the individual apprehended pursuant to that arrest.\"  Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d at 165.

Two of the rooms were registered to false names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon, the activities of the occupants of all three rooms attracted the attention of hotel employees.  The hotel's chief of security observed \"continual\" visits to occupants of all three rooms made by young people who often drove luxury cars and stayed for periods of about ten minutes.  In a hotel of 225 guest rooms, the group in the three rooms received 90% of all phone calls made to the hotel.  Moreover, the group paid their hotel bills in cash, using bundles of small denominations wrapped in rubber bands.  On a few occasions, the occupants paid for all three of the rooms together in amounts totaling approximately $300 to $400.  In addition, a \"floor supervisor\" in charge of maid service on defendants' floor at the hotel saw the occupants of all three rooms passing frequently among the three rooms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 1991, the same floor supervisor observed two revolvers on top of a bureau in Room 327.  She informed both the hotel's chief of security and local police, who, in turn, contacted agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  Later that day, ATF agents and local police officers began surveillance at the Carib Inn Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 11:00 p.m. on March 6, 1991 the surveilling agents observed defendants Hector Santiago-Alicea (Santiago-Alicea), Teddy Leon Ayala (Leon), Oscar Diaz Cruz (Diaz) and Frankie Nieves-Burgos (Nieves-Burgos)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with an unidentified man in the hotel lobby.  Santiago-Alicea was wearing a bulletproof jacket, and the agents noticed a bulge under the jacket which appeared to be a gun.  The group proceeded from the lobby to the hotel parking lot where the unidentified individual, after opening the trunk of a car, opened a plastic bag inside the trunk and counted unidentified items inside the bag.  He handed the bag to Santiago-Alicea, who then showed the contents to Leon, who gave a facial sign of approval and an affirmative nod of his head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that evening, a second unidentified man arrived at the hotel, made a call on the hotel's \"house phone,\" and was met shortly thereafter in the lobby by Nieves-Burgos and another defendant, Pedro Luis Ramirez-Rivera (Ramirez-Rivera).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After a brief conversation, Nieves-Burgos and Ramirez- Rivera went back upstairs.  Shortly thereafter they reappeared with Santiago-Alicea, who then exchanged packages with the unidentified man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 1991, the following day, Santiago-Alicea was observed waiting in the hotel parking lot, looking in all directions.  A car pulled up to him and, after a brief conversation, Santiago-Alicea handed a small paper bag to its driver, received money in exchange, counted the money, put it in his pocket and returned to the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing events, ATF and local law enforcement officials obtained a search warrant for the three hotel rooms.  On that same afternoon of March 7, 1991, they executed the warrant.  Upon entering Room 311, they found defendant Catalino Torres-Maldonado (Torres-Maldonado) seated on the floor talking on the phone, and his wife, defendant Marilyn Gotay-Colon (Gotay-Colon), seated on the sofa.  Nieves-Burgos and Ramirez-Rivera were stretched out on separate beds in the room, clad only in underpants.  Santiago-Alicea was seated on the end of one of the beds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon searching the room, the agents found that Gotay-Colon's purse contained cocaine in a plastic bag which was marked with a picture of a unicorn.  Her purse also held approximately $400 in cash in a bundle secured by a rubber band.  In a zippered, opaque tote bag on the sofa on which Gotay-Colon was seated, the agents found $2000 in cash in a bundle, again secured by a rubber band, and a loaded semiautomatic pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a night table in the room, the agents found a plastic bag containing cocaine, approximately $1500 in cash, brown paper bags, and a homemade pipe used for smoking drugs.  In the room's closet was the bulletproof jacket seen on Santiago-Alicea the night before.  Under the bed, the agents found empty plastic bags labeled with a picture of a unicorn, along with plastic straw-and-spoon type implements typical of the sort used to cut and package drugs for re-sale.  The agents also found razor blades, ordinary playing cards, and a stapler, all of which can be used to package drugs.  They also found beepers and cellular telephones.  Finally, the agents discovered keys to a gray Buick, which would later be searched by the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rooms 310 and 327, though unoccupied at the time of the search, also contained drugs and drug-related items.  Room 310 contained fifty-five packets of cocaine, again marked with a unicorn, which were found in a brown paper bag hidden in a roll-away bed or sofabed.  There was also a small amount of narcotics in an ashtray and a pipe used for smoking drugs.  The search of Room 327 turned up a pillowcase hidden above a \"dropped ceiling\" in the bathroom.  It contained sixteen brown paper bags, each of which, in turn, held 100 small packets marked with the unicorn symbol and filled with cocaine.  Under a sofa, the agents found a bullet that fit the semiautomatic pistol found in Room 311.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Leon and Diaz, who had been present for one of the transactions the night before, but who had not been present during the search of Room 311, arrived at the hotel.  Leon exclaimed, \"Oh, my god, they busted my people.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The agents asked Leon and Diaz if they knew the occupants of Room 311.  They replied in the affirmative.  Leon was carrying over $6700 in cash and a key to Room 310.  Diaz had over $1400 in cash and a hotel receipt for Room 327.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents subsequently searched two cars in the hotel parking lot.  In the first car, a green Ford LTD, they found a loaded .357 six-shot revolver, along with a photograph of Nieves-Burgos and a parking receipt with Nieves-Burgos' fingerprint on it.  The second car searched was the gray Buick, keys to which had been found in the search of Room 311.  In the Buick, the agents found a loaded nine millimeter pistol, with additional ammunition and one \"spent\" or fired bullet cartridge.  Though the Buick was not registered in Santiago-Alicea's name, the registration to the car was found in Santiago-Alicea's wallet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were tried together.  Torres-Maldonado, Gotay-Colon, Santiago-Alicea, Leon, and Diaz were all convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, and of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Gotay-Colon was also convicted of possession of cocaine based on the amount found in her purse.  See 21 U.S.C.

Moreover, \"[w]e do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.

Conspiracy and Possession with Intent to Distribute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon claim that the evidence at trial showed no more than their \"mere presence\" at the hotel.  We have recently stated that \"the culpability of a defendant's presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.  In other words, a defendant's 'mere presence' argument will fail in situations where the 'mere' is lacking.\"  United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir.1993).  While the government's evidence against Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon is less abundant than its evidence against several other defendants, it is nonetheless sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to the conspiracy and possession counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotel personnel testified that both Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon were associated with the group that occupied Rooms 310, 311 and 327.  A front desk supervisor identified Torres-Maldonado as a member of the group who had been present when cash payments were made for the three rooms, and the floor supervisor mentioned above testified that she observed Gotay-Colon passing between the three rooms.  She recalled a specific instance when Gotay-Colon went to Room 327 with Santiago-Alicea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, drugs and drug paraphernalia were lying in open view in Room 311 at the time of Torres-Maldonado's and Gotay-Colon's arrest.  Torres-Maldonado was talking on the phone when the agents entered, allowing an inference that he and Gotay-Colon were more than mere visitors.  The cocaine found in Gotay-Colon's purse, which was packaged in a bag bearing the unicorn symbol, further supports that inference.  Finally, the bundle of cash, secured characteristically with a rubber band, provides further evidence linking the couple to the group in the hotel and to drug-related activity.  In sum, there is sufficient record evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon were guilty of both conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute the drugs found at the hotel, and that, on the basis of the drugs found in her purse, Gotay-Colon was guilty of simple possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more compelling evidence, both direct and circumstantial, supports the conspiracy and possession convictions of the other defendants in this case.  For example, a jury could reasonably infer that Leon, Diaz, and Santiago-Alicea were observed by ATF agents making the very drug transactions which serve as the basis for their conspiracy and possession convictions.  Therefore, we conclude that sufficient evidence supports those convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Firearms Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Alicea, Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>a. Santiago-Alicea</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago-Alicea was observed wearing a bullet-proof vest with a protruding bulge beneath it.

In addition, given that the gun was concealed in a tote bag when the officers entered the room, there is no evidence that either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon knew of the gun's presence at the time of the arrest.  Thus, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the section 924(c)(1) convictions of either Torres-Maldonado or Gotay-Colon on a theory of aiding and abetting.  Cf. United States v.

Aside from an unsubstantiated blanket claim of prejudice, Santiago-Alicea's initial offer to provide exculpatory testimony formed the sole basis for Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's motion for severance.  Thus, even by the reasoning set out in Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon's own motion for severance, once Santiago-Alicea withdrew his offer to testify at a separate trial, he also withdrew the entire basis of his codefendants' severance motion.

In sum, Torres-Maldonado and Gotay-Colon failed to establish that a joint trial would compromise any \"specific trial right,\" see Zafiro, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 938, nor did they make the \"strong showing of evident prejudice,\" O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25, which is required to obtain severance.

But we will prove to you, from the same evidence the government collected, that during a period of time, starting at the beginning of the year, the group which was trafficking in drugs was ... using the name Panzardi from those days.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leon understood these remarks and others in Panzardi's opening statement to mean that Panzardi planned to bring evidence which would at once aid the government in proving its case against all of the other defendants and exonerate Panzardi.  Leon unsuccessfully sought severance based upon potential prejudice from Panzardi's trial tactics.  Upon careful review, we find no error in the district court's denial of this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole basis for Leon's severance motion, both below and on appeal, has been the opening statement of Panzardi's counsel.  A close reading of that opening statement shows that it was carefully, indeed artfully, worded by Panzardi's counsel to emphasize that Panzardi's innocence would be proven irrespective of the guilt of any of his codefendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, Leon points to no evidence at trial which was introduced or referred to by Panzardi that inculpated Leon or any of the other defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest possible basis for Leon's motion to sever is his view that Panzardi's defense would be antagonistic to his own.  As we have recently stated, however, \"[t]he fact that two defendants assert antagonistic defenses does not, per se, require severance, even if defendants are hostile or attempt to cast blame on each other.\"  United States v. McLaughlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578198\"><a href=\"/opinion/578198/united-states-v-bernard-michael-mclaughlin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1992).  Rather, \"the antagonism in defenses must be such that if the jury believes one defense, it is compelled to convict the other defendant.\"  United States v. Angiulo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537726\"><a href=\"/opinion/537726/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo-donato-f-angiulo-samuel-s-granito/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1195 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span> (1990).  Leon has made no such showing in this case.  The jury could have readily believed Panzardi's argument that his name was used by a group of people at the hotel, and nonetheless have acquitted Leon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  In sum, Panzardi's opening remarks did not amount to a strong showing of prejudice to Leon, nor were they subsequently accompanied by prejudicial tactics at trial.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Leon's motion for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>C.

Rather, it need only show that, at the time of the arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officers were sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.  Id.;  see also Beck v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The arrests of Leon and Diaz clearly met these standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Leon and Diaz had been observed on the evening prior to their arrest engaging in what appeared to be a drug deal.  They were apprehended the following day returning to an area of the hotel which had recently been searched and which yielded large quantities of drugs, drug paraphernalia, and firearms.  Finally, they admitted knowing members of the group who had been arrested earlier in the day.  In total, the circumstances of this case indicate that the arresting officers had probable cause to believe that both Leon and Diaz had committed or were committing an offense.  Therefore, their arrest was lawful.  Moreover, it is well established that \"[i]f an arrest is lawful, the arresting officers are entitled to search the individual apprehended pursuant to that arrest.\"  Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d at 165.
