This appeal raises a\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\nprocedural  question  of  first  impression  in our  circuit:\n\nwhether  the  dismissal  of   a  complaint,  which  does  not\n\nexplicitly   dismiss   the  action,   constitutes   a  \"final\n\ndecision[],\" and  is therefore  appealable under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1291.1    We  rule  in  the  affirmative,  holding  that  the\n\nplaintiffs had  both the  right to  appeal from the  judgment\n\ndismissing their complaint and  the duty to do so in a timely\n\nmanner.  Because plaintiffs'  appeal was not timely, we  lack\n\njurisdiction  to  review  the  dismissal  of  the  complaint.\n\nFurthermore,  we  conclude  that  appellate  jurisdiction  is\n\nlacking over the district court's denial of plaintiffs' first\n\nmotion for  postjudgment relief,  and that their  second such\n\nmotion  was untimely,  and therefore  properly denied  by the\n\ndistrict court.  Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs-appellants  are,  for  the   most  part,\n\nformer   employees  of   the  Puerto   Rico   Public  Housing\n\nAdministration  (PRPHA).   On  May  2,  1992,  PRPHA and  the\n\nCommonwealth of  Puerto Rico, acting through  former governor\n\nRafael    Hernandez   Colon,   signed   an   agreement   with\n\nrepresentatives  of the United  States Department  of Housing\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section  1291 provides:   \"The  courts of  appeals .  . .\nshall have  jurisdiction of appeals from  all final decisions\nof the district courts of the United States. . . .\"\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nand  Urban  Development  (HUD).   Under  the  agreement,  the\n\nCommonwealth  and HUD agreed to take certain actions in order\n\nto expedite the privatization  of the management of federally\n\nfunded public housing projects in Puerto Rico, as well as the\n\ndecentralization of PRPHA.   The privatization provisions  of\n\nthe agreement are at the center of plaintiffs' claims.\n\n          The agreement committed the Commonwealth to pursue,\n\nand  HUD to support,  a plan to  privatize federally assisted\n\nhousing  projects  by  transferring  the  administration  and\n\nmaintenance of such  projects to private  contractors.  As  a\n\nresult  of  this  privatization,  a  sizeable  percentage  of\n\nPRPHA's employees would  be laid off.   The agreement between\n\nHUD  and  PRPHA  briefly  addresses  the  plight  of  PRPHA's\n\nemployees in a cursory manner:\n\n          The   private   management  process   may\n          require  the   elimination  of  positions\n          within  the  present  structure   of  the\n          PRPHA.  Employees holding  said positions\n          will receive benefits as provided by law.\n          HUD  will  provide  federal  funding  for\n          payment of their benefits  resulting from\n          the   federally  funded   public  housing\n          program.    The  Commonwealth  will  fund\n          costs ineligible for federal funding.\n\nPrivatization Agreement,  Art. I,    4.   In addition,  PRPHA\n\nagreed to encourage  private contractors to  employ displaced\n\nemployees.     Id.  at     6b.    Shortly  thereafter,  PRPHA\n                  \n\nformulated  a  layoff  plan   to  comply  with  the  relevant\n\nprovisions of Puerto Rico's Public Service Personnel Act, see\n                                                             \n\n3 L.P.R.A.   1336(6).   A layoff plan was finalized in  April\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n1992,  and  the privatization  agreement was  set to  go into\n\neffect on August 1.\n\n          On  June  26,  1992  letters  were  sent  to  PRPHA\n\nemployees notifying them that,\n\n          [s]ince  you  are  one  of   the  persons\n          affected by layoffs,  we notify you  that\n          owing to  lack of work, we  have no other\n          alternative  than  to decree  your layoff\n          from  public  service effective  July 31,\n          1992.   We  advise you  of your  right to\n          present    arguments    or    documentary\n          evidence,  if  any[,] which  you consider\n          will benefit you,  before the  designated\n          official.\n\nOn July 15, 1992, plaintiffs filed an action in United States\n\nDistrict  Court  for  the  District of  Puerto  Rico  against\n\nvarious  Commonwealth  and  federal  agencies  and officers,2\n\nseeking injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief.\n\n          Plaintiffs' constitutional claims against the state\n\ndefendants  are predicated upon 42 U.S.C.   1983, while their\n\nconstitutional  claims  against  the federal  defendants  are\n\nbased  on the  doctrine set  forth in  Bivens v.  Six Unknown\n                                                             \n\nNamed  Agents,  403 U.S.  388 (1971).    The major  themes of\n             \n\nplaintiffs' complaint  are  as follows.    First,  plaintiffs\n\nallege  that  the  privatization  agreement  is  invalid (and\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  defendants in this action fall into two groups:  the\nUnited  States of  America,  HUD, and  various HUD  officials\n(hereinafter,  the  \"federal  defendants\"),  and  the  former\ngovernor of Puerto Rico,  PRPHA, and various PRPHA officials.\n(hereinafter,   the  \"state   defendants\").     All  of   the\nindividuals  were   sued  in  their   official  and  personal\ncapacities.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nconsequently that  the layoffs  were illegal) because  it was\n\nentered into  in violation  of both Puerto  Rico and  federal\n\nlaw, and that the various  local and federal defendants acted\n\nultra   vires  by   signing  the  agreement.     Accordingly,\n             \n\nplaintiffs  allege  that the  layoffs  were  illegal.   Next,\n\nplaintiffs allege that they had a property interest  in their\n\njobs,  and that they were  deprived of this property interest\n\nwithout  due process.   Finally,  plaintiffs maintain  that a\n\nPuerto Rico  official made derogatory comments  about them in\n\npublic,  thereby  depriving  them  of  \"liberty\"  without due\n\nprocess.\n\n          On October 27, 1992,  the state defendants moved to\n\ndismiss   the  complaint,   or  alternatively,   for  summary\n\njudgment, on a plethora of grounds including, but not limited\n\nto,  the complaint's  failure  to state  a  claim upon  which\n\nrelief could be granted.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6).  Two\n                             \n\ndays  later  the state  defendants  moved  to stay  discovery\n\npending the court's  resolution of their  dispositive motion.\n\nThe court granted the requested stay.\n\n          On January 15, 1993, the district court granted the\n\nstate defendants' motion  to dismiss.  The  court stated that\n\n\"[p]laintiffs' complaint  fails to  provide the Court  with a\n\nclear idea of the contours of their claims and  also fails to\n\nprovide appropriate support for their allegations.\"  Gonzalez\n                                                             \n\nv.

According  to the  court, plaintiffs'  complaint was\n\n\"infected   with   conclusory   allegations   and   unfounded\n\naccusations,\" id.  at 5-6, and  \"insufficiently illustrate[d]\n                 \n\nthe  essential nature  of their claim[s].\"   Id.  at 4.   The\n                                                \n\ncourt  dismissed  plaintiffs'  complaint  in   its  entirety,\n\nstating:  \"The Court therefore ORDERS that defendants' Motion\n\nto Dismiss pursuant  to Rule 12(b)(6)  is hereby GRANTED  and\n\nthat plaintiffs' complaint is hereby  DISMISSED.\"  Id. at  6.\n                                                      \n\nOn  the same  day the  court entered  judgment on  a separate\n\ndocument, pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 58  and 79(a),  which\n\nstated as  follows:  \"By virtue of the Opinion &amp; Order of the\n\nCourt, entered on  this date, it is  hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED\n\nand  DECREED  that   plaintiffs'  complaint  is   DISMISSED.\"\n\nPlaintiffs filed two postjudgment motions for relief, both of\n\nwhich were denied.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          In  their  notice of  appeal  filed  May 14,  1993,\n\nplaintiffs  list four  decisions of  the district  court from\n\nwhich  they appeal:   (1)  the judgment  of January  15, 1993\n\ndismissing the  complaint, and the court's  opinion and order\n\nof the same date; (2) the order of November 30, 1992 granting\n\na  stay of discovery; (3) the  order of March 2, 1993 denying\n\nplaintiffs' first  Rule 59(e) motion  for reconsideration and\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nto  amend the complaint; and (4)  the order of April 19, 1993\n\ndenying plaintiffs'secondRule 59(e)motionforreconsideration.3\n\nA.  Dismissal of the Complaint\n                              \n\n          Under Fed. R. App.  P. 4(a)(1), any party appealing\n\nfrom  a judgment or order  of the district  court, where \"the\n\nUnited  States or an officer  or agency thereof  is a party,\"\n\nmust file a notice of appeal within sixty days of the date of\n\nentry of the judgment or order.  Timely filing of a notice of\n\nappeal is  \"mandatory  and jurisdictional.\"   Perez-Perez  v.\n                                                         \n\nPopular Leasing Rental,  Inc., 993  F.2d 281,  283 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n                    \n\n3.  The plaintiffs asserted, at oral argument before us, that\nthe district  court had dismissed only  the state defendants'\nclaims,  leaving the  federal defendants'  claims unresolved.\nThus, appellants argued, this court should remand the case to\npermit  the district  court to  comply with  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n54(b) (where  multiple claims  or parties are  involved court\nmay direct  entry of  final judgment  as to  one or  more but\nfewer  than  all the  claims or  parties).   At no  point did\nplaintiffs ever assert or  suggest this contention before the\ndistrict court, either in  their motions for  reconsideration\nor in any of  their numerous other postjudgment filings.   In\nall events, however, their belated contention, if not waived,\nis without merit.\n\n    The district court  unmistakably intended to  dismiss the\ncomplaint  in toto, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), for\n                  \nfailure to state a  cognizable cause of action.   Its opinion\nand order  is most  reasonably read as  having dismissed  the\nentire complaint even though it adverts only to the motion to\n                \ndismiss  filed by  the  state defendants.   Furthermore,  the\nfinal  judgment itself  expressly dismissed  \"the plaintiffs'\ncomplaint\" after  the federal defendants had  filed their own\n                \nmotion to  dismiss shortly before the  district court entered\nits opinion and final judgment.  We are satisfied, therefore,\nthat plaintiffs'  belated Rule  54(b) contention in  no sense\nwarrants  an inference  that  plaintiffs were  misled or  the\njudgment was  not final.   Consequently, the  requirements of\nRule 54(b) are not implicated.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n1993) (quoting Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections, 434\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  257, 264  (1978)).   In  the present  case, plaintiffs'\n\nnotice of appeal was filed more  than 100 days after entry of\n\nthe judgment dismissing  the complaint.   But, under Fed.  R.\n\nApp. P. 4(a)(4), a  timely motion to alter or  amend judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) tolls the time for filing a\n\nnotice of appeal, and  the time for filing the  notice starts\n\nto run  from the entry of the order denying said motion.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. 789  Cases of Latex Surgeon Gloves,  13 F.3d\n                                                   \n\n12, 14 (1st Cir. 1993); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).   Under Rule\n\n59(e),  \"[a] motion to alter  or amend the  judgment shall be\n\nserved not later than  10 days after entry of  the judgment.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\n          Although plaintiffs' original Rule 59(e) motion was\n\ntimely filed (it was served within ten days from the entry of\n\nthe  judgment  dismissing  the  complaint),  their notice  of\n\nappeal was not filed until sixty-four days after the entry of\n\nthe order denying of the motion.  Thus, even with the benefit\n\nof Rule  4(a)(4)'s tolling  provision, plaintiffs' notice  of\n\nappeal  was seemingly late.   We lack  jurisdiction over late\n\nappeals.\n\n          This brings  us to  the principal issue  on appeal:\n\nPlaintiffs  now  argue  that  the  judgment dismissing  their\n\ncomplaint was not a \"final decision\" within the meaning of 28\n\nU.S.C.   1291, and that their time to file a notice of appeal\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndid not start to run until the denial of  their second motion\n\nfor  reconsideration.  Because the notice of appeal was filed\n\nwithin sixty days  from the  entry of the  order denying  the\n\nsecond motion,  plaintiffs  maintain  that  their  notice  of\n\nappeal was timely with respect to the underlying judgment.\n\n          We have never ruled on this procedural dilemma.  It\n\nhas,  however, given  rise to  some disagreement  among those\n\ncircuits  that have.  Three distinct views have emerged.  The\n\nSeventh  and Ninth Circuits have held that the dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint, as opposed to the dismissal of an action, is not a\n\nfinal,  appealable order,  unless  the trial  court has  made\n\nclear in dismissing  the complaint that the  action could not\n\nbe  saved by amendment.   See Benjamin v.  United States, 833\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  669, 672 (7th Cir.  1987); Ruby v.  Secretary of United\n                                                             \n\nStates Navy, 365 F.2d 385, 387 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n386  U.S. 1011  (1967).   On the  other hand, the  Second and\n\nEighth  Circuits have held  that, absent an  express grant of\n\nleave to  amend, an order  dismissing the complaint  is final\n\nand  appealable.  See Weisman v. LeLandais, 532 F.2d 308, 309\n                                          \n\n(2d  Cir. 1976); Quartana  v.

It has  held that  such an  order of\n\ndismissal  is not final if \"the plaintiff could not have been\n\nreasonably expected to realize that the court was  entering a\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nfinal order.\"   Czeremcha v.

The Seventh  and Ninth Circuits  have held\n\nthat the dismissal of a complaint is not final and appealable\n\nbecause a motion  to dismiss is  not a \"responsive  pleading\"\n\nwithin the  meaning of  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  15(a),4 and thus  a\n\nplaintiff still retains his or  her right to amend once as  a\n\nmatter  of course  under Rule  15(a) even  after a  motion to\n\ndismiss has been  granted.

Rule 15(a) provides, in relevant part:\n\n          A  party may  amend the  party's pleading\n          once as  a matter  of course at  any time\n          before a responsive pleading is served. .\n          .  .   Otherwise  a party  may amend  the\n          party's  pleading  only by  leave  of the\n          court  or  by   written  consent  of  the\n          adverse party; and leave shall  be freely\n          given when justice so requires.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nunder Rule 15(a) once  a motion to dismiss has  been granted.\n\nThe court stated:\n\n          [W]hile the law in this circuit is that a\n          motion to  dismiss  is not  a  responsive\n          pleading, and therefore the complaint may\n          be  amended without  leave  of the  court\n          [after  such  a  motion is  made],  it is\n          equally well established that  this right\n          terminates  upon  the  granting   of  the\n          motion to dismiss.\n\nId. (citations  omitted).   The Eighth Circuit,  which shares\n   \n\nthe  Second Circuit's view that the right to amend under Rule\n\n15(a) terminates upon dismissal,  found that this distinction\n\nprovided support for following the Second Circuit's rule that\n\nthe  dismissal of a complaint was a \"final decision,\" but did\n\nnot  view  the  distinction  dispositive.5   Ultimately,  the\n\nEighth Circuit joined the Second, reasoning as follows:\n\n          Where matters of finality  (and therefore\n          of appellate jurisdiction) are concerned,\n          we  believe it preferable  to adopt rules\n          that  promote clarity and certainty.  The\n          Second  and Ninth  Circuit rules  have an\n          advantage  over  that  of   the  Eleventh\n          Circuit in this regard because they focus\n          solely on  the language of  the dismissal\n          order,  requiring  an  explicit  contrary\n          statement  to  avoid  a   presumption  of\n          finality (Second Circuit) or non-finality\n          (Ninth Circuit). Comparing the Second and\n\n                    \n\n5.  The  court  cited  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  opinion   in\nCzeremcha,  724 F.2d  at 1554-56,  to illustrate  this point.\n         \nAccording  to  the Eleventh  Circuit,  after  a complaint  is\ndismissed the right to amend under Rule 15(a) terminates. But\nthe  dismissal  does not  act as  a  final judgment,  and the\nplaintiff  may still move the court for leave to amend unless\nthe \"court has clearly indicated either that no  amendment is\npossible or that dismissal  of the complaint also constitutes\ndismissal of the action.\"  Id. at 1556 n.6.\n                              \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Ninth Circuit rules,  that of the  Second\n          Circuit commends itself because it avoids\n          confusion over when  a plaintiff's  right\n          to    amend    a   dismissed    complaint\n          terminates, the order becomes  final, and\n          the time for appeal begins to run.\n\nQuartana, 789 F.2d at 1300. \n        \n\n          The \"intermediate approach\"  taken by the  Eleventh\n\nCircuit  was grounded in  that court's desire  to formulate a\n\nrule consistent with \"Rule 15's liberal mandate that leave to\n\namend  be `freely  given when  justice so  requires,' without\n\ngranting the plaintiff  carte blanche power to  reopen a case\n\nat  will by  filing an  amendment.\"   Czeremcha, 724  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1554-55.  Under this approach, \"[a]lthough the plaintiff does\n\nnot  have  a  right to  amend  as a  matter  of  course after\n\ndismissal of  the complaint [see supra note 5], the dismissal\n                                      \n\nitself does not automatically terminate the action unless the\n\ncourt  holds either that no amendment is possible or that the\n\ndismissal of the complaint  also constitutes dismissal of the\n\naction.\"  Id. at 1554 (footnotes omitted).\n             \n\n          We  find  the  reasoning  employed  by  the  Eighth\n\nCircuit  to  be  compelling,  and  thus  adopt  the  approach\n\nembraced  by  that   court  and  the  Second  Circuit.    Our\n\nconclusion  that  the  order  in   this  case  is  final   is\n\nstrengthened by several factors.   First, consistent with the\n\nSecond and Eighth Circuits,  a plaintiff's time to  amend his\n\nor  her complaint  as  a matter  of  right within  the  First\n\nCircuit terminates  upon a district court's  dismissal of the\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\ncomplaint.   See Jackson v. Salon,  614 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1980).  Second, the dismissal of the complaint in the present\n\ncase  was set forth in  a separate document,  as required for\n\nfinal judgments under Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.  See  Quartana, 789\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 1300 n.2.   Third, plaintiffs, as evidenced  by their\n\nRule 59(e) motions, apparently  understood the judgment to be\n\nfinal.    See  id.6    And  finally,  the  dismissal  of  the\n                  \n\ncomplaint   fits  comfortably   under  the   Supreme  Court's\n\ndefinition  of a \"final decision.\"   The Court  has defined a\n\n\"final decision\" as  one that  \"`ends the  litigation on  the\n\nmerits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the\n\njudgment.'\"  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n368, 373-74 (1981) (quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n229, 233 (1945)).   A dismissal for failure to  state a claim\n\nunder Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is  a decision on the merits.\n\nSee Local No. 714 v. Greater Portland Transit Dist., 589 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1,  6 (1st  Cir. 1978);  see also  5 James  W. Moore  et al.,\n                                 \n\nMoore's  Federal Practice    41.14  at 41-170 (2d  ed. 1993).\n                         \n\nHere the complaint  was dismissed by  the district court  for\n\nfailure  to state a claim,  and judgment was  then entered on\n\nthe docket and set forth on a separate document in accordance\n\nwith  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  58  and  79(a).    Accordingly,  the\n\n                    \n\n6.  Thus, it  appears that plaintiffs have  constructed their\npresent argument  after the  fact in an  attempt to  preserve\nappellate review of the dismissal of their complaint.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\ndismissal  of  plaintiffs'  complaint  possesses all  of  the\n\nmarkings of a \"final decision.\"\n\n          In short, we  hold that when a  district court uses\n\nthe  words, \"The  complaint is dismissed,\"  without expressly\n\ngranting  the plaintiff  leave  to amend,  this  is a  \"final\n\ndecision\" from which a  timely appeal may be taken.   Because\n\nthere was not  a timely  appeal taken by  plaintiffs we  lack\n\nappellate jurisdiction over their  attack on the dismissal of\n\nthe complaint.\n\n          Plaintiffs  also argue  that  the second  motion to\n\nreconsider,  which was served within 10 days of the denial of\n\nthe  first motion,  extended  the time  period  for filing  a\n\nnotice of appeal from the dismissal of the complaint, thereby\n\nrendering the notice timely.  This argument has no merit.  It\n\nis well settled that a motion for reconsideration served more\n\nthan ten days after the entry of judgment does not effect the\n\ntime for  appealing  from that  judgment.   See Feinstein  v.\n                                                         \n\nMoses,  951 F.2d  16, 18  (1st  Cir. 1991);  Fed. R.  App. P.\n     \n\n4(a)(4);  see also 6A Moore,  supra   59.13[3]  at 59-282 (\"A\n                                   \n\n[second] motion for reconsideration  that is served more than\n\nten  days  after the  entry of  judgment  has no  effect upon\n\nappeal  time, which runs from the entry of the original order\n\ndenying  . . . an alteration or amendment of the judgment.\").\n\nBecause  plaintiffs' second  motion  for reconsideration  was\n\nserved two months  after entry of the judgment dismissing the\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\ncomplaint, it was untimely under Rule 59(e), and did not toll\n\nthe  appeal period for that  judgment.

In addition,  plaintiffs appeal from the district court's\ndecision  to stay  discovery  pending the  resolution of  the\nstate defendants' motion to  dismiss or for summary judgment.\nAs a result of the foregoing discussion, we lack jurisdiction\nover this appeal.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\ntogether with a motion to amend  the complaint accompanied by\n\na proposed  amended complaint.8   On February  12, plaintiffs\n\nfiled  a document  entitled  \"Supplemental Arguments  to  our\n\nMotion  for Reconsideration.\"   These  supplemental arguments\n\nwere an expansion of several  arguments made by plaintiffs in\n\nthe Rule  59(e) motion.   On February 26,  federal defendants\n\nfiled  a  response  to  plaintiffs'  supplemental  arguments.\n\nFinally, on  March 3,  the district court  denied plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for reconsideration,  effectively denying their motion\n\nfor  leave to  amend the  complaint.

We  have consistently  held that  an\n\norder denying  a Rule  59(e) motion challenging  the judgment\n\nconstitutes  a   \"judgment,\"  and  is   therefore  appealable\n\nseparately  from  the  appeal  of  the  underlying  judgment.\n\nKersey v.

R. Civ. P. 6(a).  But  plaintiffs' notice of\n\nappeal  was not filed until sixty-four  days after the denial\n\nof this motion, and  therefore the notice was untimely.   See\n                                                             \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nsupra page 7.   Plaintiffs argue, however, that  their second\n     \n\nRule  59(e) motion (served within  ten days of  the denial of\n\nthe  original Rule  59(e)  motion) extended  the time  period\n\nwithin  which to  file  a notice  of  appeal from  the  order\n\ndenying  the original motion.   Id.10  Because  the notice of\n                                   \n\nappeal  was filed  within sixty  days from  the entry  of the\n\norder denying the second motion, plaintiffs conclude that the\n\nnotice was timely with  respect to both postjudgment motions.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Although    it    was    entitled    \"Motion    for\n\nReconsideration of  the Last  Decision Issued and  Entered by\n\nthe Honorable  Court,\" plaintiffs'  second Rule 59(e)  motion\n\nwas an obvious attempt to have the district court revisit the\n\nlegal  basis  for its  January  15,  1993 opinion  and  order\n\ndismissing  the  complaint.     In  their  second  motion  to\n\nreconsider,  plaintiffs  merely elaborated  on  various legal\n\narguments  that were  addressed,  albeit in  less detail,  in\n\ntheir original  Rule 59(e) motion.  Thus, plaintiffs not only\n\nrequested  the same relief in the second Rule 59(e) motion as\n\nthey did in the first, including, inter alia, that (1) \"[t]he\n                                            \n\njudgment  dismissing the  complaint  be set  aside,\" and  (2)\n\n\"[d]iscovery proceedings be allowed to continue,\" they sought\n\n                    \n\n10.  We have already determined that plaintiffs'  second Rule\n59(e) motion  did not extend the time  for filing a notice of\nappeal from the dismissal of the complaint.  See supra p. 13-\n                                                      \n14.\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nthat relief  on the  same grounds.   Accordingly, plaintiffs'\n\nsecond  Rule 59(e)  motion  must be  viewed  as a  motion  to\n\nreconsider  the  judgment  dismissing  the  complaint.    See\n                                                             \n\nEchevarria-Gonzalez  v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24, 26 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.  1988)   (\"`nomenclature  should  not  be  exalted  over\n\nsubstance'\" (quoting Lyell Theatre  Corp. v. Loews Corp., 682\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 37, 41 (2d Cir. 1982))).\n\n          Because plaintiffs'  second  Rule 59(e)  motion  to\n\nreconsider  was,  in  reality,  a motion  to  reconsider  the\n\njudgment dismissing  the complaint, and it  was untimely (not\n\nserved within 10 days of entry of the judgment), the district\n\ncourt was without jurisdiction to grant it.  Vargas, 975 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 918;  Rodriguez-Antuna v.

Furthermore, the  untimely\n\nsecond motion  to reconsider could  not enlarge the  time for\n\nfiling a notice of appeal from the order denying the original\n\nmotion to reconsider.  See Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 18; Fed.

To the extent that they seek to challenge the\n\nApril 19,  1993 order denying  the second Rule  59(e) motion,\n\nthe order is affirmed.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.\n                                                Affirmed\n                                                        \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n",

Sec. 1291.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We rule in the affirmative, holding that the plaintiffs had both the right to appeal from the judgment dismissing their complaint and the duty to do so in a timely manner.  Because plaintiffs' appeal was not timely, we lack jurisdiction to review the dismissal of the complaint.  Furthermore, we conclude that appellate jurisdiction is lacking over the district court's denial of plaintiffs' first motion for postjudgment relief, and that their second such motion was untimely, and therefore properly denied by the district court.

On May 2, 1992, PRPHA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, acting through former governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, signed an agreement with representatives of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Under the agreement, the Commonwealth and HUD agreed to take certain actions in order to expedite the privatization of the management of federally funded public housing projects in Puerto Rico, as well as the decentralization of PRPHA.  The privatization provisions of the agreement are at the center of plaintiffs' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement committed the Commonwealth to pursue, and HUD to support, a plan to privatize federally assisted housing projects by transferring the administration and maintenance of such projects to private contractors.  As a result of this privatization, a sizeable percentage of PRPHA's employees would be laid off.  The agreement between HUD and PRPHA briefly addresses the plight of PRPHA's employees in a cursory manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The private management process may require the elimination of positions within the present structure of the PRPHA.  Employees holding said positions will receive benefits as provided by law.  HUD will provide federal funding for payment of their benefits resulting from the federally funded public housing program.  The Commonwealth will fund costs ineligible for federal funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Privatization Agreement, Art.  I, Sec. 4.  In addition, PRPHA agreed to encourage private contractors to employ displaced employees.  Id. at Sec. 6b.  Shortly thereafter, PRPHA formulated a layoff plan to comply with the relevant provisions of Puerto Rico's Public Service Personnel Act, see 3 L.P.R.A. Sec. 1336(6).  A layoff plan was finalized in April 1992, and the privatization agreement was set to go into effect on August 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992 letters were sent to PRPHA employees notifying them that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[s]ince you are one of the persons affected by layoffs, we notify you that owing to lack of work, we have no other alternative than to decree your layoff from public service effective July 31, 1992.  We advise you of your right to present arguments or documentary evidence, if any[,] which you consider will benefit you, before the designated official.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 15, 1992, plaintiffs filed an action in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against various Commonwealth and federal agencies and officers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seeking injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' constitutional claims against the state defendants are predicated upon 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, while their constitutional claims against the federal defendants are based on the doctrine set forth in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  The major themes of plaintiffs' complaint are as follows.  First, plaintiffs allege that the privatization agreement is invalid (and consequently that the layoffs were illegal) because it was entered into in violation of both Puerto Rico and federal law, and that the various local and federal defendants acted ultra vires by signing the agreement.  Accordingly, plaintiffs allege that the layoffs were illegal.  Next, plaintiffs allege that they had a property interest in their jobs, and that they were deprived of this property interest without due process.  Finally, plaintiffs maintain that a Puerto Rico official made derogatory comments about them in public, thereby depriving them of \"liberty\" without due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1992, the state defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively, for summary judgment, on a plethora of grounds including, but not limited to, the complaint's failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  Two days later the state defendants moved to stay discovery pending the court's resolution of their dispositive motion.  The court granted the requested stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1993, the district court granted the state defendants' motion to dismiss.  The court stated that \"[p]laintiffs' complaint fails to provide the Court with a clear idea of the contours of their claims and also fails to provide appropriate support for their allegations.\"  Gonzalez v. Hernandez, No. 92-1972, slip op. at 4, 1993 WL 52807 (D.P.R. Jan. 15, 1993).  According to the court, plaintiffs' complaint was \"infected with conclusory allegations and unfounded accusations,\" id. at 5-6, and \"insufficiently illustrate[d] the essential nature of their claim[s].\"  Id. at 4.   The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, stating:  \"The Court therefore ORDERS that defendants' Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is hereby GRANTED and that plaintiffs' complaint is hereby DISMISSED.\"  Id. at 6.   On the same day the court entered judgment on a separate document, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 and 79(a), which stated as follows:  \"By virtue of the Opinion &amp; Order of the Court, entered on this date, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that plaintiffs' complaint is DISMISSED.\"   Plaintiffs filed two postjudgment motions for relief, both of which were denied.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their notice of appeal filed May 14, 1993, plaintiffs list four decisions of the district court from which they appeal:  (1) the judgment of January 15, 1993 dismissing the complaint, and the court's opinion and order of the same date;  (2) the order of November 30, 1992 granting a stay of discovery;  (3) the order of March 2, 1993 denying plaintiffs' first Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration and to amend the complaint;  and (4) the order of April 19, 1993 denying plaintiffs' second Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Dismissal of the Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), any party appealing from a judgment or order of the district court, where \"the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party,\" must file a notice of appeal within sixty days of the date of entry of the judgment or order.  Timely filing of a notice of appeal is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\"  Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281, 283 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 561, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978)).  In the present case, plaintiffs' notice of appeal was filed more than 100 days after entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint.  But, under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), a timely motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal, and the time for filing the notice starts to run from the entry of the order denying said motion.  See United States v. 789 Cases of Latex Surgeon Gloves, 13 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1993);  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).  Under Rule 59(e), \"[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although plaintiffs' original Rule 59(e) motion was timely filed (it was served within ten days from the entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint), their notice of appeal was not filed until sixty-four days after the entry of the order denying of the motion.  Thus, even with the benefit of Rule 4(a)(4)'s tolling provision, plaintiffs' notice of appeal was seemingly late.  We lack jurisdiction over late appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the principal issue on appeal:  Plaintiffs now argue that the judgment dismissing their complaint was not a \"final decision\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, and that their time to file a notice of appeal did not start to run until the denial of their second motion for reconsideration.  Because the notice of appeal was filed within sixty days from the entry of the order denying the second motion, plaintiffs maintain that their notice of appeal was timely with respect to the underlying judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have never ruled on this procedural dilemma.  It has, however, given rise to some disagreement among those circuits that have.  Three distinct views have emerged.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have held that the dismissal of a complaint, as opposed to the dismissal of an action, is not a final, appealable order, unless the trial court has made clear in dismissing the complaint that the action could not be saved by amendment.  See Benjamin v. United States, 833 F.2d 669, 672 (7th Cir.1987);  Ruby v. Secretary of United States Navy, 365 F.2d 385, 387 (9th Cir.1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1011, 87 S.Ct. 1358, 18 L.Ed.2d 442 (1967).  On the other hand, the Second and Eighth Circuits have held that, absent an express grant of leave to amend, an order dismissing the complaint is final and appealable.  See Weisman v. LeLandais, 532 F.2d 308, 309 (2d Cir.1976);  Quartana v. Utterback, 789 F.2d 1297, 1300 (8th Cir.1986).  Finally, the Eleventh Circuit has carved out a middle ground.  It has held that such an order of dismissal is not final if \"the plaintiff could not have been reasonably expected to realize that the court was entering a final order.\"  Czeremcha v. International Ass'n of Mach. &amp; Aero.  Workers, 724 F.2d 1552, 1555 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before deciding which, if any, of these three approaches to adopt, we briefly explain the rationale underlying each.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have held that the dismissal of a complaint is not final and appealable because a motion to dismiss is not a \"responsive pleading\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and thus a plaintiff still retains his or her right to amend once as a matter of course under Rule 15(a) even after a motion to dismiss has been granted.  See Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1111 (7th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 1758, 84 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985);  222 East Chestnut St. Corp. v. Lakefront Realty Corp., 256 F.2d 513 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 232, 3 L.Ed.2d 228 (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Elfenbein v. Gulf &amp; Western Indus., Inc., 590 F.2d 445, 448 n. 1 (2d Cir.1978), the Second Circuit explained that the split on this issue was based on the circuits' differing views on the right to amend a complaint under Rule 15(a) once a motion to dismiss has been granted.  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[W]hile the law in this circuit is that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading, and therefore the complaint may be amended without leave of the court [after such a motion is made], it is equally well established that this right terminates upon the granting of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).  The Eighth Circuit, which shares the Second Circuit's view that the right to amend under Rule 15(a) terminates upon dismissal, found that this distinction provided support for following the Second Circuit's rule that the dismissal of a complaint was a \"final decision,\" but did not view the distinction dispositive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit joined the Second, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Where matters of finality (and therefore of appellate jurisdiction) are concerned, we believe it preferable to adopt rules that promote clarity and certainty.  The Second and Ninth Circuit rules have an advantage over that of the Eleventh Circuit in this regard because they focus solely on the language of the dismissal order, requiring an explicit contrary statement to avoid a presumption of finality (Second Circuit) or non-finality (Ninth Circuit).  Comparing the Second and Ninth Circuit rules, that of the Second Circuit commends itself because it avoids confusion over when a plaintiff's right to amend a dismissed complaint terminates, the order becomes final, and the time for appeal begins to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quartana, 789 F.2d at 1300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"intermediate approach\" taken by the Eleventh Circuit was grounded in that court's desire to formulate a rule consistent with \"Rule 15's liberal mandate that leave to amend be 'freely given when justice so requires,' without granting the plaintiff carte blanche power to reopen a case at will by filing an amendment.\"  Czeremcha, 724 F.2d at 1554-55.   Under this approach, \"[a]lthough the plaintiff does not have a right to amend as a matter of course after dismissal of the complaint [see supra note 5], the dismissal itself does not automatically terminate the action unless the court holds either that no amendment is possible or that the dismissal of the complaint also constitutes dismissal of the action.\"  Id. at 1554 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the reasoning employed by the Eighth Circuit to be compelling, and thus adopt the approach embraced by that court and the Second Circuit.  Our conclusion that the order in this case is final is strengthened by several factors.  First, consistent with the Second and Eighth Circuits, a plaintiff's time to amend his or her complaint as a matter of right within the First Circuit terminates upon a district court's dismissal of the complaint.  See Jackson v. Salon, 614 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1980).  Second, the dismissal of the complaint in the present case was set forth in a separate document, as required for final judgments under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58.  See Quartana, 789 F.2d at 1300 n. 2.   Third, plaintiffs, as evidenced by their Rule 59(e) motions, apparently understood the judgment to be final.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  And finally, the dismissal of the complaint fits comfortably under the Supreme Court's definition of a \"final decision.\"   The Court has defined a \"final decision\" as one that \" 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.' \"  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 373-74, 101 S.Ct. 669, 673, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981) (quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633-34, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)).  A dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is a decision on the merits.  See Local No. 714 v. Greater Portland Transit Dist., 589 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1978);  see also 5 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 41.14 at 41-170 (2d ed. 1993).  Here the complaint was dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim, and judgment was then entered on the docket and set forth on a separate document in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 and 79(a).  Accordingly, the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint possesses all of the markings of a \"final decision.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we hold that when a district court uses the words, \"The complaint is dismissed,\" without expressly granting the plaintiff leave to amend, this is a \"final decision\" from which a timely appeal may be taken.  Because there was not a timely appeal taken by plaintiffs we lack appellate jurisdiction over their attack on the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the second motion to reconsider, which was served within 10 days of the denial of the first motion, extended the time period for filing a notice of appeal from the dismissal of the complaint, thereby rendering the notice timely.  This argument has no merit.  It is well settled that a motion for reconsideration served more than ten days after the entry of judgment does not effect the time for appealing from that judgment.  See Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4);  see also 6A Moore, supra p 59.13 at 59-282 (\"A [second] motion for reconsideration that is served more than ten days after the entry of judgment has no effect upon appeal time, which runs from the entry of the original order denying ... an alteration or amendment of the judgment.\").  Because plaintiffs' second motion for reconsideration was served two months after entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint, it was untimely under Rule 59(e), and did not toll the appeal period for that judgment.  See Jusino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986, 989 (1st Cir.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Postjudgment Motions for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a complaint is dismissed without leave to amend, the plaintiff can appeal the judgment, or alternatively, seek leave to amend under Rule 15(a) after having the judgment reopened under either Rule 59 or 60.  Unless postjudgment relief is granted, the district court lacks power to grant a motion to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a).  See Public Citizen v. Liggett Group, Inc., 858 F.2d 775, 781 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1030, 109 S.Ct. 838, 102 L.Ed.2d 970 (1989);  see also 3 Moore supra p 15.10 at 15-107 (\"[A]fter a judgment of dismissal plaintiff must move under Rules 59(e) or 60(b) to reopen the judgment.\");   6 Charles A.

Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1489 at 692-93 (1990) (\"[O]nce judgment is entered the filing of an amendment cannot be allowed until the judgment is set aside or vacated under Rule 59 or Rule 60.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1993, within ten days of the entry of judgment, plaintiffs served a motion for reconsideration and/or to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), together with a motion to amend the complaint accompanied by a proposed amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  On February 12, plaintiffs filed a document entitled \"Supplemental Arguments to our Motion for Reconsideration.\"   These supplemental arguments were an expansion of several arguments made by plaintiffs in the Rule 59(e) motion.  On February 26, federal defendants filed a response to plaintiffs' supplemental arguments.  Finally, on March 3, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, effectively denying their motion for leave to amend the complaint.  The court declined to address plaintiffs' supplemental arguments, indicating that they were \"moot.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 1993, plaintiffs filed a second motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e).  We note that plaintiffs' second motion for reconsideration did not specifically invoke Rule 59(e), or for that matter, any federal rule.  Nonetheless, we have consistently held that \" 'a motion which ask[s] the court to modify its earlier disposition of the case because of an allegedly erroneous legal result is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).' \"  Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 19 n. 3 (quoting Lopez v. Corporacion Azucarera de Puerto Rico, 938 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir.1991));  789 Cases of Latex Surgeon Gloves, 13 F.3d at 14 (\"[A] post judgment motion asking the court to change its disposition solely because of legal error must be brought under Rule 59(e).\"  (emphasis in original)).  Where, as here, the motion sought to set aside the court's prior rulings solely on the basis of alleged legal errors, it is properly treated as a motion brought under Rule 59(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, the district court denied the second motion to reconsider and warned plaintiffs that it would no longer entertain motions for postjudgment relief.  Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's orders denying both postjudgment motions.  We have consistently held that an order denying a Rule 59(e) motion challenging the judgment constitutes a \"judgment,\" and is therefore appealable separately from the appeal of the underlying judgment.  Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 485 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993);  Fiore v. Washington Cty. Com. Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 233 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, plaintiffs' original Rule 59(e) motion was timely, i.e., it was served within ten days of the judgment, excluding intermediate weekends and holidays, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a).  But plaintiffs' notice of appeal was not filed until sixty-four days after the denial of this motion, and therefore the notice was untimely.  See supra pages 386-87.  Plaintiffs argue, however, that their second Rule 59(e) motion (served within ten days of the denial of the original Rule 59(e) motion) extended the time period within which to file a notice of appeal from the order denying the original motion.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because the notice of appeal was filed within sixty days from the entry of the order denying the second motion, plaintiffs conclude that the notice was timely with respect to both postjudgment motions.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it was entitled \"Motion for Reconsideration of the Last Decision Issued and Entered by the Honorable Court,\" plaintiffs' second Rule 59(e) motion was an obvious attempt to have the district court revisit the legal basis for its January 15, 1993 opinion and order dismissing the complaint.  In their second motion to reconsider, plaintiffs merely elaborated on various legal arguments that were addressed, albeit in less detail, in their original Rule 59(e) motion.  Thus, plaintiffs not only requested the same relief in the second Rule 59(e) motion as they did in the first, including, inter alia, that (1) \"[t]he judgment dismissing the complaint be set aside,\" and (2) \"[d]iscovery proceedings be allowed to continue,\" they sought that relief on the same grounds.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' second Rule 59(e) motion must be viewed as a motion to reconsider the judgment dismissing the complaint.  See Echevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir.1988) (\" 'nomenclature should not be exalted over substance' \" (quoting Lyell Theatre Corp. v. Loews Corp., 682 F.2d 37, 41 (2d Cir.1982))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because plaintiffs' second Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider was, in reality, a motion to reconsider the judgment dismissing the complaint, and it was untimely (not served within 10 days of entry of the judgment), the district court was without jurisdiction to grant it.  Vargas, 975 F.2d at 918;  Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1989).  Furthermore, the untimely second motion to reconsider could not enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal from the order denying the original motion to reconsider.  See Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 18;  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, to the extent that plaintiff challenges the March 3, 1993 order denying the original Rule 59(e) motion, the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  To the extent that they seek to challenge the April 19, 1993 order denying the second Rule 59(e) motion, the order is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 1291 provides:  \"The courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The defendants in this action fall into two groups:  the United States of America, HUD, and various HUD officials (hereinafter, the \"federal defendants\"), and the former governor of Puerto Rico, PRPHA, and various PRPHA officials.

Thus, appellants argued, this court should remand the case to permit the district court to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (where multiple claims or parties are involved court may direct entry of final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all the claims or parties).  At no point did plaintiffs ever assert or suggest this contention before the district court, either in their motions for reconsideration or in any of their numerous other postjudgment filings.  In all events, however, their belated contention, if not waived, is without merit</p>\n        <p>The district court unmistakably intended to dismiss the complaint in toto, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a cognizable cause of action.  Its opinion and order is most reasonably read as having dismissed the entire complaint even though it adverts only to the motion to dismiss filed by the state defendants.  Furthermore, the final judgment itself expressly dismissed \"the plaintiffs' complaint\" after the federal defendants had filed their own motion to dismiss shortly before the district court entered its opinion and final judgment.  We are satisfied, therefore, that plaintiffs' belated Rule 54(b) contention in no sense warrants an inference that plaintiffs were misled or the judgment was not final.  Consequently, the requirements of Rule 54(b) are not implicated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 15(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served....

On May 2, 1992, PRPHA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, acting through former governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, signed an agreement with representatives of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Under the agreement, the Commonwealth and HUD agreed to take certain actions in order to expedite the privatization of the management of federally funded public housing projects in Puerto Rico, as well as the decentralization of PRPHA.  The privatization provisions of the agreement are at the center of plaintiffs' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement committed the Commonwealth to pursue, and HUD to support, a plan to privatize federally assisted housing projects by transferring the administration and maintenance of such projects to private contractors.  As a result of this privatization, a sizeable percentage of PRPHA's employees would be laid off.  The agreement between HUD and PRPHA briefly addresses the plight of PRPHA's employees in a cursory manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The private management process may require the elimination of positions within the present structure of the PRPHA.

Shortly thereafter, PRPHA formulated a layoff plan to comply with the relevant provisions of Puerto Rico's Public Service Personnel Act, see 3 L.P.R.A. Sec. 1336(6).  A layoff plan was finalized in April 1992, and the privatization agreement was set to go into effect on August 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992 letters were sent to PRPHA employees notifying them that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[s]ince you are one of the persons affected by layoffs, we notify you that owing to lack of work, we have no other alternative than to decree your layoff from public service effective July 31, 1992.

First, plaintiffs allege that the privatization agreement is invalid (and consequently that the layoffs were illegal) because it was entered into in violation of both Puerto Rico and federal law, and that the various local and federal defendants acted ultra vires by signing the agreement.  Accordingly, plaintiffs allege that the layoffs were illegal.  Next, plaintiffs allege that they had a property interest in their jobs, and that they were deprived of this property interest without due process.  Finally, plaintiffs maintain that a Puerto Rico official made derogatory comments about them in public, thereby depriving them of \"liberty\" without due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1992, the state defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively, for summary judgment, on a plethora of grounds including, but not limited to, the complaint's failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  Two days later the state defendants moved to stay discovery pending the court's resolution of their dispositive motion.  The court granted the requested stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1993, the district court granted the state defendants' motion to dismiss.

The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, stating:  \"The Court therefore ORDERS that defendants' Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is hereby GRANTED and that plaintiffs' complaint is hereby DISMISSED.\"  Id. at 6.   On the same day the court entered judgment on a separate document, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 and 79(a), which stated as follows:  \"By virtue of the Opinion &amp; Order of the Court, entered on this date, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that plaintiffs' complaint is DISMISSED.\"   Plaintiffs filed two postjudgment motions for relief, both of which were denied.

In the present case, plaintiffs' notice of appeal was filed more than 100 days after entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint.  But, under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), a timely motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal, and the time for filing the notice starts to run from the entry of the order denying said motion.

Because the notice of appeal was filed within sixty days from the entry of the order denying the second motion, plaintiffs maintain that their notice of appeal was timely with respect to the underlying judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have never ruled on this procedural dilemma.  It has, however, given rise to some disagreement among those circuits that have.  Three distinct views have emerged.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have held that the dismissal of a complaint, as opposed to the dismissal of an action, is not a final, appealable order, unless the trial court has made clear in dismissing the complaint that the action could not be saved by amendment.  See Benjamin v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497330\"><a href=\"/opinion/497330/keith-benjamin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span>, 672 (7th Cir.1987);  Ruby v.

On the other hand, the Second and Eighth Circuits have held that, absent an express grant of leave to amend, an order dismissing the complaint is final and appealable.  See Weisman v. LeLandais, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334143\"><a href=\"/opinion/334143/lawrence-i-weisman-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-james-l-weisman-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 309 (2d Cir.1976);  Quartana v.

Finally, the Eleventh Circuit has carved out a middle ground.  It has held that such an order of dismissal is not final if \"the plaintiff could not have been reasonably expected to realize that the court was entering a final order.\"  Czeremcha v. International Ass'n of Mach. &amp; Aero.  Workers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429666\"><a href=\"/opinion/429666/robert-czeremcha-v-international-association-of-machinists-and-aerospace/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1552</span></a></span>, 1555 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before deciding which, if any, of these three approaches to adopt, we briefly explain the rationale underlying each.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have held that the dismissal of a complaint is not final and appealable because a motion to dismiss is not a \"responsive pleading\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and thus a plaintiff still retains his or her right to amend once as a matter of course under Rule 15(a) even after a motion to dismiss has been granted.

The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[W]hile the law in this circuit is that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading, and therefore the complaint may be amended without leave of the court [after such a motion is made], it is equally well established that this right terminates upon the granting of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).  The Eighth Circuit, which shares the Second Circuit's view that the right to amend under Rule 15(a) terminates upon dismissal, found that this distinction provided support for following the Second Circuit's rule that the dismissal of a complaint was a \"final decision,\" but did not view the distinction dispositive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit joined the Second, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Where matters of finality (and therefore of appellate jurisdiction) are concerned, we believe it preferable to adopt rules that promote clarity and certainty.  The Second and Ninth Circuit rules have an advantage over that of the Eleventh Circuit in this regard because they focus solely on the language of the dismissal order, requiring an explicit contrary statement to avoid a presumption of finality (Second Circuit) or non-finality (Ninth Circuit).  Comparing the Second and Ninth Circuit rules, that of the Second Circuit commends itself because it avoids confusion over when a plaintiff's right to amend a dismissed complaint terminates, the order becomes final, and the time for appeal begins to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quartana, 789 F.2d at 1300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"intermediate approach\" taken by the Eleventh Circuit was grounded in that court's desire to formulate a rule consistent with \"Rule 15's liberal mandate that leave to amend be 'freely given when justice so requires,' without granting the plaintiff carte blanche power to reopen a case at will by filing an amendment.\"  Czeremcha, 724 F.2d at 1554-55.   Under this approach, \"[a]lthough the plaintiff does not have a right to amend as a matter of course after dismissal of the complaint [see supra note 5], the dismissal itself does not automatically terminate the action unless the court holds either that no amendment is possible or that the dismissal of the complaint also constitutes dismissal of the action.\"  Id. at 1554 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the reasoning employed by the Eighth Circuit to be compelling, and thus adopt the approach embraced by that court and the Second Circuit.  Our conclusion that the order in this case is final is strengthened by several factors.  First, consistent with the Second and Eighth Circuits, a plaintiff's time to amend his or her complaint as a matter of right within the First Circuit terminates upon a district court's dismissal of the complaint.  See Jackson v. Salon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373916\"><a href=\"/opinion/373916/anthony-jackson-v-stephen-salon/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1980).  Second, the dismissal of the complaint in the present case was set forth in a separate document, as required for final judgments under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58.  See Quartana, 789 F.2d at 1300 n. 2.   Third, plaintiffs, as evidenced by their Rule 59(e) motions, apparently understood the judgment to be final.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  And finally, the dismissal of the complaint fits comfortably under the Supreme Court's definition of a \"final decision.\"   The Court has defined a \"final decision\" as one that \" 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.' \"  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Greater Portland Transit Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362192\"><a href=\"/opinion/362192/local-division-no-714-amalgamated-transit-union-afl-cio-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1978);  see also 5 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 41.14 at 41-170 (2d ed. 1993).  Here the complaint was dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim, and judgment was then entered on the docket and set forth on a separate document in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 and 79(a).  Accordingly, the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint possesses all of the markings of a \"final decision.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we hold that when a district court uses the words, \"The complaint is dismissed,\" without expressly granting the plaintiff leave to amend, this is a \"final decision\" from which a timely appeal may be taken.  Because there was not a timely appeal taken by plaintiffs we lack appellate jurisdiction over their attack on the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the second motion to reconsider, which was served within 10 days of the denial of the first motion, extended the time period for filing a notice of appeal from the dismissal of the complaint, thereby rendering the notice timely.  This argument has no merit.  It is well settled that a motion for reconsideration served more than ten days after the entry of judgment does not effect the time for appealing from that judgment.  See Feinstein v. Moses, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4);  see also 6A Moore, supra p 59.13 at 59-282 (\"A [second] motion for reconsideration that is served more than ten days after the entry of judgment has no effect upon appeal time, which runs from the entry of the original order denying ... an alteration or amendment of the judgment.\").  Because plaintiffs' second motion for reconsideration was served two months after entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint, it was untimely under Rule 59(e), and did not toll the appeal period for that judgment.

In their second motion to reconsider, plaintiffs merely elaborated on various legal arguments that were addressed, albeit in less detail, in their original Rule 59(e) motion.  Thus, plaintiffs not only requested the same relief in the second Rule 59(e) motion as they did in the first, including, inter alia, that (1) \"[t]he judgment dismissing the complaint be set aside,\" and (2) \"[d]iscovery proceedings be allowed to continue,\" they sought that relief on the same grounds.

All of the individuals were sued in their official and personal capacities</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs asserted, at oral argument before us, that the district court had dismissed only the state defendants' claims, leaving the federal defendants' claims unresolved.  Thus, appellants argued, this court should remand the case to permit the district court to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (where multiple claims or parties are involved court may direct entry of final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all the claims or parties).  At no point did plaintiffs ever assert or suggest this contention before the district court, either in their motions for reconsideration or in any of their numerous other postjudgment filings.  In all events, however, their belated contention, if not waived, is without merit</p>\n        <p>The district court unmistakably intended to dismiss the complaint in toto, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a cognizable cause of action.  Its opinion and order is most reasonably read as having dismissed the entire complaint even though it adverts only to the motion to dismiss filed by the state defendants.  Furthermore, the final judgment itself expressly dismissed \"the plaintiffs' complaint\" after the federal defendants had filed their own motion to dismiss shortly before the district court entered its opinion and final judgment.  We are satisfied, therefore, that plaintiffs' belated Rule 54(b) contention in no sense warrants an inference that plaintiffs were misled or the judgment was not final.  Consequently, the requirements of Rule 54(b) are not implicated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 15(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served....  Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party;  and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The court cited the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Czeremcha, 724 F.2d at 1554-56, to illustrate this point.  According to the Eleventh Circuit, after a complaint is dismissed the right to amend under Rule 15(a) terminates.  But the dismissal does not act as a final judgment, and the plaintiff may still move the court for leave to amend unless the \"court has clearly indicated either that no amendment is possible or that dismissal of the complaint also constitutes dismissal of the action.\"  Id. at 1556 n. 6</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Thus, it appears that plaintiffs have constructed their present argument after the fact in an attempt to preserve appellate review of the dismissal of their complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In addition, plaintiffs appeal from the district court's decision to stay discovery pending the resolution of the state defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.  As a result of the foregoing discussion, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The motion also cites Rule 60(b)(6) but identifies no \"extraordinary circumstances\" that might bring this provision into play.
