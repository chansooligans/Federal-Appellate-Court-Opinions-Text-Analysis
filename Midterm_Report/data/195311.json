Cloherty, Assistant  United States Attorneys,  on brief  for\n              \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n                        April 13, 1994\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.   Following  his conviction  on two  arson-\n                \n\nrelated  offenses,  defendant  James  Mitchell   was  ordered\n\ndetained  pending   sentencing  pursuant  to   18  U.S.C.    \n\n3143(a)(2).  He  now appeals from  this order, alleging  that\n\nthe district court improperly  characterized his offenses  as\n\n\"crimes of  violence\" within the  meaning of the  Bail Reform\n\nAct.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n     The  facts  giving  rise  to  these  convictions,  which\n\ndefendant  does  not  dispute  for purposes  of  the  instant\n\nappeal,  can be summarized as follows.  Defendant was the co-\n\nowner  and operator of a  private club in  Boston named \"Club\n\n297.\"   In January 1989, city officials ordered that the club\n\nbe  closed  because  of  various  health  and  building  code\n\nviolations.   Believing that there was  no realistic prospect\n\nof obtaining  approval to reopen, defendant  devised a scheme\n\nto burn the  building in order to collect insurance proceeds.\n\nIn return for a promised $11,000 payment, defendant persuaded\n\ncodefendant Ronald Wallace (a club employee) to set the fire.\n\nOn  the  evening  of February  6,  1989,  in accordance  with\n\ndefendant's  instructions,   Wallace   ignited  a   pile   of\n\nmattresses soaked  with kerosene.   The ensuing  blaze caused\n\nover  $500,000 in damages.  At least three other persons were\n\nin the  building at the time, one of whom had to be evacuated\n\nby the police.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     After a  14-day jury  trial, defendant was  convicted of\n\nconspiracy  to commit arson (in violation of 18 U.S.C.   371)\n\nand aiding and abetting  arson (in violation of 18  U.S.C.   \n\n844(i)  and  2).   Deeming these  offenses  to be  \"crimes of\n\nviolence\"  as  defined  in   18  U.S.C.     3156(a)(4),1  the\n\ndistrict court found that  defendant was subject to mandatory\n\ndetention pending sentencing pursuant  to   3143(a)(2).2  The\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 3156(a)(4) reads as follows:\n\n     [T]he term \"crime of violence\" means--\n          (A) an offense  that has as an  element of the\n     offense the  use, attempted use, or  threatened use\n     of physical force against the person or property of\n     another, or\n          (B)  any other  offense that  is a  felony and\n     that, by its  nature, involves  a substantial  risk\n     that physical  force against the person or property\n     of another may be used in the course of  committing\n     the offense.\n\n2.  This provision, with its cross-reference to   3142(f)(1),\nprovides in relevant part as follows:\n\n     The judicial officer shall  order that a person who\n     has been found guilty of  [a crime of violence] and\n     is awaiting imposition or  execution of sentence be\n     detained unless--\n          (A)(i) the  judicial officer finds  that there\n     is a  substantial  likelihood  that  a  motion  for\n     acquittal or new trial will be granted; or\n          (ii)  an  attorney   for  the  Government  has\n     recommended that  no  sentence of  imprisonment  be\n     imposed on the person; and\n          (B) the  judicial officer finds  by clear  and\n     convincing evidence  that the person is  not likely\n     to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the\n     community.\n\n18  U.S.C.    3143(a)(2).   While  the  court here  found  no\nlikelihood of flight or danger under subsection (B),  it also\nfound  pursuant to subsection (A) that a motion for new trial\nwas unlikely to  be granted and that  a prison term  would be\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt thereafter postponed defendant's reporting date for two\n\nweeks  due   to   family  considerations,   relying  on   the\n\n\"exceptional reasons\" provision in   3145(c).  \n\n     On  appeal,  defendant's   sole  challenge  is   to  the\n\ndetermination   that  his  offenses   constituted  crimes  of\n\nviolence.  He does  not dispute (as he apparently  did below)\n\nthat the substantive crime of arson set forth in 18 U.S.C.   \n\n844(i)  is  embraced  by   this  term.3    Rather,  defendant\n\ncontends  that  conspiring to  commit  arson  and aiding  and\n                                                             \n\nabetting the  commission thereof--the crimes of  which he was\n        \n\nconvicted--are  sufficiently  distinct  from  the  underlying\n\nsubstantive offense,  and are  sufficiently less culpable  in\n\nnature,  so as  to fall  outside the  definition of  crime of\n\nviolence.   Defendant has  cited no  authority in  support of\n\nthese assertions, and we find them unpersuasive.  \n\n     We  turn to  the aiding  and abetting  charge  first, as\n\ndefendant's argument  in this regard  merits scant attention.\n\n                    \n\nrecommended. \n\n3.  Any  such argument  would have  been  plainly unavailing.\nSee,  e.g., United States v. Marzullo, 780 F. Supp. 658, 662-\n                                     \n65 (W.D. Mo. 1991)  (finding arson to be an offense  that \"by\nits nature  involves a  substantial risk that  physical force\nagainst  the person or  property of another  would be used\");\nUnited States v. Shaker, 665 F. Supp. 698, 702 n.4 (N.D. Ind.\n                       \n1987) (same); cf.  United States  v. Lee, 726  F.2d 128,  131\n                                        \n(4th  Cir.) (noting that arson was crime of violence under 18\nU.S.C.    1952(a)(2)),  cert. denied,  467 U.S.  1253 (1984);\n                                    \nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii)  (explicitly including \"arson\" within\ndefinition of \"crime of  violence\" for purposes of sentencing\nguidelines). \n\n                             -4-\n\nDefendant suggests that, because he did  not actually set the\n\nfire, he was  merely a \"culpable intermediary\" whose  role in\n\nthe offense was  less flagrant  than that of  Wallace.   This\n\ncontention, of course, flies in the face of the evidence that\n\ndefendant initiated  and orchestrated the entire  scheme.  In\n\nany event,  the precise nature of  defendant's involvement is\n\nof  little  relevance,4 for  aiding  and abetting  \"is  not a\n\nseparate  offense\"  from  the  underlying  substantive crime.\n\nUnited  States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 1990),\n                         \n\ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 977 (1991).  One who aids and abets an\n            \n\noffense  \"is punishable as a  principal,\" 18 U.S.C.    2, and\n\n\"the  acts of  the principal  become those  of the  aider and\n          \n\nabetter as a matter of  law.\"  United States v.  Simpson, 979\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1282, 1285 (8th Cir. 1992) (emphasis in original), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 113 S. Ct. 1345 (1993).  Accordingly, as other courts\n      \n\nhave held in analogous circumstances, aiding and abetting the\n\ncommission  of a  crime of  violence is  a crime  of violence\n\nitself.   See, e.g., United  States v. Groce,  999 F.2d 1189,\n                                            \n\n1191-92  (7th Cir.  1993)  (aiding and  abetting burglary  is\n\n\"violent felony\" under Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.  \n\n                    \n\n4.  His conviction  on the aiding and  abetting charge means,\nat  a  minimum, that  defendant  \"in  some sort  associate[d]\nhimself  with the venture, that he participate[d] in it as in\nsomething that he  wishe[d] to bring about,  that he [sought]\nby  his action to  make it succeed.\"   United States v.

Ct. 1237\n                                           \n\n(1992). \n\n     We  likewise  agree  with  the  district  court  that  a\n\nconspiracy to commit a crime of violence is itself a crime of\n\nviolence.   As the Second Circuit explained  in United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400 (2d Cir. 1985): \"The existence of\n             \n\na criminal  grouping increases  the chances that  the planned\n\ncrime will be  committed beyond that  of a mere  possibility.\n\nBecause  the conspiracy  itself  provides a  focal point  for\n\ncollective criminal  action, attainment of  the conspirators'\n\nobjectives becomes instead a  significant probability.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 404  (emphasis in  original).  The  court therefore  found\n\nthat  conspiracy  to commit  armed  robbery,  even though  an\n\ninchoate  crime,  was   nonetheless  an  act  \"involving   'a\n\nsubstantial risk' of violence\" and  so constituted a crime of\n\n                             -6-\n\nviolence  under the Bail Reform Act.5  Id.

Sec. 3143(a)(2).  He now appeals from this order, alleging that the district court improperly characterized his offenses as \"crimes of violence\" within the meaning of the Bail Reform Act.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts giving rise to these convictions, which defendant does not dispute for purposes of the instant appeal, can be summarized as follows.  Defendant was the co-owner and operator of a private club in Boston named \"Club 297.\"   In January 1989, city officials ordered that the club be closed because of various health and building code violations.  Believing that there was no realistic prospect of obtaining approval to reopen, defendant devised a scheme to burn the building in order to collect insurance proceeds.  In return for a promised $11,000 payment, defendant persuaded codefendant Ronald Wallace (a club employee) to set the fire.  On the evening of February 6, 1989, in accordance with defendant's instructions, Wallace ignited a pile of mattresses soaked with kerosene.  The ensuing blaze caused over $500,000 in damages.  At least three other persons were in the building at the time, one of whom had to be evacuated by the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a 14-day jury trial, defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit arson (in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371) and aiding and abetting arson (in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 844(i) and 2).  Deeming these offenses to be \"crimes of violence\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3156(a)(4),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court found that defendant was subject to mandatory detention pending sentencing pursuant to Sec. 3143(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court thereafter postponed defendant's reporting date for two weeks due to family considerations, relying on the \"exceptional reasons\" provision in Sec. 3145(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendant's sole challenge is to the determination that his offenses constituted crimes of violence.  He does not dispute (as he apparently did below) that the substantive crime of arson set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(i) is embraced by this term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Rather, defendant contends that conspiring to commit arson and aiding and abetting the commission thereof--the crimes of which he was convicted--are sufficiently distinct from the underlying substantive offense, and are sufficiently less culpable in nature, so as to fall outside the definition of crime of violence.  Defendant has cited no authority in support of these assertions, and we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the aiding and abetting charge first, as defendant's argument in this regard merits scant attention.  Defendant suggests that, because he did not actually set the fire, he was merely a \"culpable intermediary\" whose role in the offense was less flagrant than that of Wallace.  This contention, of course, flies in the face of the evidence that defendant initiated and orchestrated the entire scheme.  In any event, the precise nature of defendant's involvement is of little relevance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> for aiding and abetting \"is not a separate offense\" from the underlying substantive crime.  United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 611 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 977, 111 S.Ct. 1625, 113 L.Ed.2d 722 (1991).  One who aids and abets an offense \"is punishable as a principal,\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2, and \"the acts of the principal become those of the aider and abetter as a matter of law.\"  United States v. Simpson, 979 F.2d 1282, 1285 (8th Cir.1992) (emphasis in original), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1345, 122 L.Ed.2d 727 (1993).  Accordingly, as other courts have held in analogous circumstances, aiding and abetting the commission of a crime of violence is a crime of violence itself.  See, e.g., United States v. Groce, 999 F.2d 1189, 1191-92 (7th Cir.1993) (aiding and abetting burglary is \"violent felony\" under Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1));  Simpson, 979 F.2d at 1285-86 (defendant, having aided and abetted bank robbery, was subject to sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) for having aided and abetted use of firearm during crime of violence);  United States v. Hathaway, 949 F.2d 609, 610 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam) (Vermont crime of third-degree arson, which prohibits \"secondary acts such as counseling, aiding or procuring the burning,\" falls within \"generic definition\" of arson offense and so is \"violent felony\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1237, 117 L.Ed.2d 470 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise agree with the district court that a conspiracy to commit a crime of violence is itself a crime of violence.  As the Second Circuit explained in United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400 (2d Cir.1985):  \"The existence of a criminal grouping increases the chances that the planned crime will be committed beyond that of a mere possibility.  Because the conspiracy itself provides a focal point for collective criminal action, attainment of the conspirators' objectives becomes instead a significant probability.\"  Id. at 404 (emphasis in original).  The court therefore found that conspiracy to commit armed robbery, even though an inchoate crime, was nonetheless an act \"involving 'a substantial risk' of violence\" and so constituted a crime of violence under the Bail Reform Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Id.  (quoting 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3156(a)(4)(B));  accord, e.g., United States v. DiSomma, 951 F.2d 494, 496 (2d Cir.1991) (same);  United States v.

Chimurenga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451520\"><a href=\"/opinion/451520/united-states-v-coltrane-chimurenga-aka-randolph-simms-aka-rashid/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1985):  \"The existence of a criminal grouping increases the chances that the planned crime will be committed beyond that of a mere possibility.  Because the conspiracy itself provides a focal point for collective criminal action, attainment of the conspirators' objectives becomes instead a significant probability.\"  Id. at 404 (emphasis in original).  The court therefore found that conspiracy to commit armed robbery, even though an inchoate crime, was nonetheless an act \"involving 'a substantial risk' of violence\" and so constituted a crime of violence under the Bail Reform Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Id.
