Appellant, Theodis Watkins,\n                                   \n\nappeals from the district court's dismissal of his petition under\n\n28 U.S.C.   2254.  We affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          Watkins was  convicted of  first degree murder  on June\n\n23, 1976 and sentenced to  life in prison.1  In 1979, he  filed a\n\npro  se petition for a  writ of habeas  corpus (\"1979 Petition\").\n       \n\nThe  1979 Petition was  \"mixed\"; it presented  both exhausted and\n\nunexhausted  claims  for  relief.2   The  magistrate  recommended\n\ndismissal of the  1979 Petition and  the district court  affirmed\n\nafter   appellant   failed   to   challenge    the   magistrate's\n\nrecommendations within  the prescribed  ten day period.   Watkins\n\nsought a certificate of  probable cause for appeal, Fed.  R. App.\n\nP. 22(b),  on the two claims that had been exhausted.  This court\n\ndenied the request and dismissed the appeal.  \n\n          Watkins unsuccessfully pursued  his unexhausted  claims\n\nin state court during the  1980s.  In 1990, he filed  the current\n\npetition  for writ  of habeas  corpus (\"1990  Petition\") alleging\n\nthree  grounds  that  were  not  raised  in  the  1979 Petition.3\n\n                    \n\n1   See Commonwealth v.  Watkins, 373 Mass.  849, 370 N.E.2d  701\n                                \n(1977), for the facts underlying Watkins' conviction.\n\n2  The 1979  Petition asserted the following grounds  for relief:\n(1) failure  to sequester witnesses;  (2) inadequate instructions\non  manslaughter;  (3)  inadequate instructions  on  malice;  (4)\nfailure to direct a  verdict for Watkins based on  defective jury\ncharges that shifted the  burden of proof to the  petitioner; (5)\nimproper confinement  to the dock during  trial.  At the  time of\nfiling Watkins had only exhausted the first two grounds.\n\n3   The amended  1990 Petition  sought  relief based  on (1)  the\ninadequacy of the trial  court's instruction on reasonable doubt;\n(2) the inadequacy of the  court's instruction on the distinction\nbetween first and second degree murder; and (3) the inadequacy of\n\nRelying  on  McCleskey  v. Zant,  111  S.  Ct.  1454 (1991),  the\n                               \n\ndistrict court dismissed the first two grounds as an abuse of the\n\nwrit and ruled against Watkins on the third.  Watkins now appeals\n\nonly the  two arguments  dismissed for  abuse  of the  writ.   As\n\nappellant  has failed  to raise  the third  ground on  appeal, we\n\ntreat it as waived.  Brown  v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n337, 352 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937 (1990).\n                                      \n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          In  McCleskey, the  Supreme Court  used the  cause-and-\n                       \n\nprejudice  standard  applicable to  cases of  procedural default,\n\nsee, e.g., Wainwright  v. Sykes, 433 U.S.  72 (1977), as part  of\n                               \n\nits analysis  of the  problems arising from  successive petitions\n\nfor habeas corpus.  The court stated, \n\n            [t]o  excuse  his  failure  to  raise the\n            claim  earlier,  he must  show  cause for\n            failing   to   raise  it   and  prejudice\n            therefrom  as  those  concepts have  been\n            defined   in   our   procedural   default\n            decisions.  . .  .  If  petitioner cannot\n            show cause, the failure to rise the claim\n            in an earlier petition may nonetheless be\n            excused  if he  or  she can  show that  a\n            fundamental miscarriage  of justice would\n            result  from a  failure to  entertain the\n            claim.\n\n111 S. Ct. at 1470.  Earlier, in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 510\n                                              \n\n(1982),  the  Supreme  Court  perceived  that  the  multitude  of\n\npiecemeal habeas  petitions unduly burdened  the federal  courts.\n\nRose  sought  to  consolidate  the  issues  for  appeal  in   one\n    \n\nproceeding  in  each  court  system by  establishing  the  \"total\n\n                    \n\nthe trial court's instruction on malice.\n\n                               -3-\n\nexhaustion\"  rule.  But it also preserved immediate access to the\n\nfederal  courts  on  exhausted issues,  provided  the  petitioner\n\nconsciously  wished to  risk  losing an  opportunity for  federal\n\nreview of  other claims.  455  U.S. at 510.   Thus, Rose required\n                                                        \n\nthat district  courts entertaining mixed  habeas petitions  offer\n\npetitioners an  explicit choice to proceed on exhausted claims or\n\ndelay federal review to bring all claims once exhausted.  Id.\n                                                             \n\n          The  Commonwealth contends that  Watkins' 1990 Petition\n\nfalls  squarely within  McCleskey  because back  in 1979  Watkins\n                                 \n\nchose  to appeal only the  two exhausted claims  presented in the\n\n1979 Petition, and, therefore, bore  the \"risks [of] dismissal of\n\n[his]  subsequent  federal petition[]\"  for  abuse  of the  writ.\n\nRose, 455  U.S. at  510;  McCleskey, 111  S. Ct.  at  1467.   The\n                                   \n\nCommonwealth  argues  further that  Watkins  abused  the writ  by\n\nfailing to  assert the  reasonable doubt  and  the second  degree\n\nmurder claims in the original 1979 Petition since Watkins did not\n\nallege,  nor could  he, that  he lacked  a substantial  basis for\n\nthose claims in 1979.  See McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1468.\n                                    \n\n          Watkins counters  that the merits of  the two exhausted\n\nclaims  in the 1979 Petition were never properly before the court\n\nof appeals because Watkins was never presented the choice between\n\ndismissal and  continuing only with exhausted  claims as required\n\nby  Rose, 455 U.S.  at 510.   According to Watkins,  the district\n        \n\ncourt  effectively made  the  choice for  him  by dismissing  the\n\npetition  as mixed.   On appeal,  this court  refused to  issue a\n\ncertificate  of probable cause  and dismissed the  appeal.  Thus,\n\n                               -4-\n\nargues Watkins, there can  be no abuse because the  1990 Petition\n\nis the first petition properly before the court.\n\n          We  agree with  the Commonwealth  that we  reviewed the\n\nmerits  of two exhausted claims in the 1979 Petition.  Watkins v.\n                                                              \n\nCallahan, Misc.  No. 80-8063 (1st Cir.  Nov. 20, 1980).   When we\n        \n\ndecided that appeal, the  Supreme Court's \"total exhaustion\" rule\n\nof Rose  had not  yet  been decided.    This Circuit,  and  seven\n       \n\nothers, did not  condition district court review of  mixed habeas\n\npetitions on exhaustion of all state court claims.  See Rose, 455\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 513 n.5 and cases cited therein; Miller v. Hall, 536 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n967, 969  (1st Cir. 1976); Katz  v. King, 627 F.2d  568, 574 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1980).   In Niziolek  v. Ashe, 694  F.2d 282, 287  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1982), we held that individuals \"who filed mixed petitions before\n\nRose issued  should  not be  penalized  for having  followed  the\n    \n\nprocedure that prevailed at  the time.\"  That practice  permitted\n\nthe  court   to  rule  on  exhausted   claims,  while  dismissing\n\nunexhausted claims,  because \"it would be  indefensible to refuse\n\nto consider a  meritorious claim  merely on the  grounds that  it\n\nmight eventually be mooted  by a favorable state court  ruling on\n\nhis  appeal of  unrelated  issues.\"   Miller,  536 F.2d  at  969.\n                                            \n\nProviding prompt relief to  individuals who filed mixed petitions\n\nobviously  did not  contemplate  summarily  rejecting  subsequent\n\npetitions.\n\n          We followed the pre-Rose  procedure with respect to the\n                                  \n\n1979 Petition.  We  dismissed the merits of the  exhausted claims\n\nand  reserved consideration  of  the unexhausted  claims.   Thus,\n\n                               -5-\n\nWatkins reasonably assumed that we would consider his unexhausted\n\nclaims  in a  subsequent  petition once  he  had exhausted  them.\n\nBecause  we considered the 1979 Petition  on the merits, however,\n\nwe  must use  it  as the  bench  mark for  the  abuse-of-the-writ\n\nanalysis.\n\n          In   this   context,  McCleskey's   cause-and-prejudice\n                                         \n\nstandard plainly requires the  dismissal of claims raised  in the\n\n1990  Petition  that   Watkins  failed  to  raise  in   the  1979\n\nPetition.4   To justify the  failure to raise  a claim, appellant\n\nmust demonstrate  that some  \"external impediment, whether  it be\n\ngovernment  interference or the  reasonable unavailability of the\n\nfactual  basis for  the  claim, must  have  prevented [him]  from\n\nraising the claim.\"  McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1472.  Watkins also\n                              \n\nfailed  to demonstrate that  he made  a \"reasonable  and diligent\n\ninvestigation aimed at including  all relevant claims and grounds\n\nfor relief in  the first federal habeas petition.\"   Id. at 1472.\n                                                        \n\nThis test forms the cause prong of the McCleskey test and Watkins\n                                                \n\nfailed  to meet  it.    Although  Watkins' counsel  asserted that\n\nWatkins could meet both prongs at the hearing before the district\n\ncourt on  the 1990 Petition, he never  explained how.  On appeal,\n\nWatkins  did  not  raise the  argument.    We  conclude that  the\n\nreasonable  doubt  and  second-degree murder  challenges  to  his\n\nconviction  were available  to Watkins  at the  time of  the 1979\n\nPetition and  that he  has shown  no cause  for failing to  raise\n\n                    \n\n4   Despite the age of this case there is no problem as McCleskey\n                                                                 \napplies retroactively.  Andiarena v. United States, 967 F.2d 715,\n                                                  \n717-18 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                               -6-\n\nthem.\n\n          Finally, Watkins' argues that even if the 1990 Petition\n\nis an abuse, a \"fundamental miscarriage of justice  would result\"\n\nfrom  refusing to  consider his  new claims.   This  exception to\n\nMcCleskey   is   narrow,  as   it   is   contemplated  only   for\n         \n\n\"extraordinary instances when a constitutional violation probably\n\nhas caused the conviction of one innocent of the crime.\"   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n1470.    In  describing   this  exception,  the  McCleskey  court\n                                                          \n\nsuggested that the petitioner  must supplement the constitutional\n\nviolation with  a \"colorable showing of factual  innocence.\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 1471 (quoting Kuhlmann  v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436,  454 (1986));\n                                    \n\nsee also Wise v. Fulcomer, 958 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1992).  \n                         \n\n          Watkins'  case  falls  outside  this  narrow  exception\n\nbecause he did not squarely raise the \"fundamental miscarriage of\n\njustice\" issue before the  district court.  While he  claims that\n\nthe  argument  was  implicit  in  his Memorandum  in  Support  of\n\nPetition  for Writ of Habeas Corpus, we find this insufficient in\n\nlight of the fact that Watkins did not argue the exception at the\n\nhearing  before the district court  when it ruled  against him on\n\nthe basis of McCleskey.5  \n                      \n\n          \"This circuit  religiously follows the rule that issues\n\nnot  presented to the district court cannot be raised on appeal.\"\n\nOuimette v.

Only  in\n\ncases in which \"a  gross miscarriage of justice\" would  occur and\n\nin  which  \"the new  ground [is]  so  compelling as  to virtually\n\ninsure appellant's  success\" can we consider  arguments that were\n\nnot raised below.  Hern ndez-Hern ndez v. United States, 904 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n758, 763 (1st Cir.  1990) (quoting Johnston v.

To determine whether  a gross\n\nmiscarriage  of justice  would occur  if we  do not  consider the\n\nMcCleskey exception, we must look at appellant's claims.\n         \n\n          Watkins   first  challenges  the   trial  court's  jury\n\ninstructions on reasonable doubt.  He claims that four aspects of\n\nthe   instructions,   when    taken   together,   derogate    the\n\nCommonwealth's  burden of proof.   First, the  trial court stated\n\nthat  reasonable doubt  was  not \"foolish\"  or \"fanciful\"  doubt.\n\nSecond,  it suggested  that reasonable  doubt was  something less\n\nthan  a \"mathematical  or an  artificial  certainty.\"   Third, it\n\npresented its  instruction on essential  elements of a  crime, as\n\nopposed to collateral  issues, in a  confusing manner.   Finally,\n\nthe  trial court  stated that  \"the average  layman's version  of\n\n'reasonable doubt' would  come pretty  close to what  the law  in\n\nmuch more technical language says.\"  \n\n          While criminal defendants often  challenge instructions\n\non reasonable doubt, \"our experience has been that even imperfect\n\nformulations usually meet constitutional requirements when viewed\n\nin  the context of the  entire charge.\"   Lanigan v. Maloney, 853\n                                                            \n\n                               -8-\n\nF.2d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1007  (1989).\n                                         \n\nWe  must \"tolerate a reasonable range of expression, some or even\n\nmuch of which may not  suit our fancy,\" unless we impose  pattern\n\njury instructions.  Bumpus v. Gunter, 635 F.2d 907, 910 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1980), cert.  denied, 450 U.S.  1003 (1981).   In this  case, the\n                    \n\ntrial  judge's instruction  on  reasonable doubt  were less  than\n\nperfect.   They were confusing in  parts, but do not  rise to the\n\nlevel of constitutional infirmity.  \n\n          The trial  court's statement with respect  to \"foolish\"\n\nor  \"fanciful\" doubt came close to the instruction we censured in\n\nDunn v. Perrin,  570 F.2d 21,  24 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  437\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 910 (1978).  In Dunn,  the trial court erred by shifting the\n                         \n\nburden to the  defendant.   It stated that  reasonable doubt  was\n\ndoubt  that could not \"readily or easily [be] explained away, but\n\nrather such  a strong  and abiding  conviction  as still  remains\n\nafter careful consideration of all the  facts and arguments . . .\n\n.\"  Id.    In this case, the trial court did not shift the burden\n       \n\nto defendant.   It stated that reasonable doubt was \"a doubt that\n\nresides in the mind of a  reasonable man who is earnestly seeking\n\nthe truth.   It is not  a foolish doubt.   It  is not a  fanciful\n\ndoubt.  It is  not a doubt in the  mind of a juror who  is simply\n\nseeking  an  excuse  to  acquit  a  defendant.\"    While  a  poor\n\nformulation,  this instruction  essentially asked  the jurors  to\n\nseriously pursue  the truth.   Appellant's  reliance  on Dunn  is\n                                                             \n\nmisplaced.   \n\n          With  respect to the  other errors alleged,  it is true\n\n                               -9-\n\nthat the trial judge indicated that a mathematical certainty  was\n\nnot possible.  The  trial judge nonetheless exhorted the  jury to\n\nbe  as  certain  as  humanly  possible  and  instructed that  the\n\nCommonwealth  was  required  to   prove  each  element  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt, if in a  somewhat convoluted manner.   Finally,\n\nthe  introductory comment  that the  layman's version  is \"pretty\n\nclose\" to  the law's  technical definition, even  when considered\n\nalong  side  the other  disputed  verbal  formulations, does  not\n\nprevent us from finding that the challenged aspects of the charge\n\ndid not  \"so infect the entire  charge and trial as  to cause the\n\njury to evaluate petitioner's guilt or innocence under a standard\n\nless  than 'beyond a reasonable doubt'.\"  Lanigan v. Maloney, 853\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 40, 48 n.7 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Bumpus, 635 F.2d at 909,\n                                               \n\nfor standard  required to reverse state  conviction on reasonable\n\ndoubt  instruction).     The  trial   court  did  not   commit  a\n\nconstitutional  error in  its instructions  on reasonable  doubt.\n\nThus,  we do not find his  arguments \"so compelling\" as to insure\n\nsuccess and,  consequently, there has been  no \"gross miscarriage\n\nof justice.\"  Hern ndez-Hern ndez, 904 F.2d at 763.   \n                                 \n\n          Appellant also challenges the trial court's instruction\n\non the definition of  premeditated murder.  During deliberations,\n\nthe jury  requested further  instruction on  premeditated murder.\n\nThe trial judge answered their question by stating, \n\n            [p]remeditated  murder  as  distinguished\n            from murder  in the  second degree is  if\n            [sic]  it  is planned  beforehand,  or to\n            give  you  an alternative  definition, if\n            there  is a  definite decision  to commit\n            the act followed by the commission of the\n\n                               -10-\n\n            act, that would be premeditation.\n\nNone of the  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court  cases cited by\n\nappellant  undermines  this  charge.   The  charge  accords  with\n\nCommonwealth v. Ruci,  409 Mass.  94, 96, 564  N.E.2d 1000,  1002\n                    \n\n(1991), which requires that defendant reflect on  a resolution to\n\nkill  the victim,  and with  Commonwealth v. Callahan,  401 Mass.\n                                                     \n\n627, 633, 519 N.E.2d 245,  249 (1988), which states that  the act\n\nnot be so  spontaneous as  to prevent reflection.   Neither  case\n\nmandates  that  specific words  be  used.   Moreover,  the  court\n\nindicated  in  Callahan that  the  judge's  added statement  that\n                       \n\npremeditation  \"excludes action which  is taken  so spontaneously\n\nthat there is no time to think,\" was appropriate only because the\n\njudge   earlier  stated  that  premeditation  \"may  occur  within\n\nseconds.\"   The  trial judge  in  this case  did not  imply  that\n\npremeditation  could be formed in seconds.  In this case, Watkins\n\nargued with the victim in the hallway outside the apartment, went\n\nto the  kitchen to get a knife, and returned to the hallway where\n\nhe fatally stabbed the victim.  Watkins had time to reflect.\n\n          The jury focused on the critical distinction  necessary\n\nto find guilt  beyond a reasonable  doubt of the  crime of  first\n\ndegree murder.   It chose to  convict Watkins.  Again,  we do not\n\nfind  Watkins'   arguments  compelling  and  discern   no  \"gross\n\nmiscarriage of  justice.\"  Hern ndez-Hern ndez, 904  F.2d at 763.\n                                              \n\nThus, we  are not required to considered the McCleskey exception.\n                                                      \n\nAs a final matter, we note that Watkins has not made \"a colorable\n\nshowing of  factual innocence,\" making the  likelihood of success\n\n                               -11-\n\non the exception exceptionally slim.\n\n          Because the district court properly  dismissed Watkins'\n\nnew arguments as an abuse of the writ, we affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -12-\n",

Watkins\n\nsought a certificate of  probable cause for appeal, Fed.  R. App.\n\nP. 22(b),  on the two claims that had been exhausted.  This court\n\ndenied the request and dismissed the appeal.  \n\n          Watkins unsuccessfully pursued  his unexhausted  claims\n\nin state court during the  1980s.  In 1990, he filed  the current\n\npetition  for writ  of habeas  corpus (\"1990  Petition\") alleging\n\nthree  grounds  that  were  not  raised  in  the  1979 Petition.3\n\n                    \n\n1   See Commonwealth v.

Thus, Rose required\n                                                        \n\nthat district  courts entertaining mixed  habeas petitions  offer\n\npetitioners an  explicit choice to proceed on exhausted claims or\n\ndelay federal review to bring all claims once exhausted.

Ct.  at  1467.   The\n                                   \n\nCommonwealth  argues  further that  Watkins  abused  the writ  by\n\nfailing to  assert the  reasonable doubt  and  the second  degree\n\nmurder claims in the original 1979 Petition since Watkins did not\n\nallege,  nor could  he, that  he lacked  a substantial  basis for\n\nthose claims in 1979.  See McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1468.\n                                    \n\n          Watkins counters  that the merits of  the two exhausted\n\nclaims  in the 1979 Petition were never properly before the court\n\nof appeals because Watkins was never presented the choice between\n\ndismissal and  continuing only with exhausted  claims as required\n\nby  Rose, 455 U.S.  at 510.   According to Watkins,  the district\n        \n\ncourt  effectively made  the  choice for  him  by dismissing  the\n\npetition  as mixed.   On appeal,  this court  refused to  issue a\n\ncertificate  of probable cause  and dismissed the  appeal.  Thus,\n\n                               -4-\n\nargues Watkins, there can  be no abuse because the  1990 Petition\n\nis the first petition properly before the court.\n\n          We  agree with  the Commonwealth  that we  reviewed the\n\nmerits  of two exhausted claims in the 1979 Petition.

We  dismissed the merits of the  exhausted claims\n\nand  reserved consideration  of  the unexhausted  claims.   Thus,\n\n                               -5-\n\nWatkins reasonably assumed that we would consider his unexhausted\n\nclaims  in a  subsequent  petition once  he  had exhausted  them.\n\nBecause  we considered the 1979 Petition  on the merits, however,\n\nwe  must use  it  as the  bench  mark for  the  abuse-of-the-writ\n\nanalysis.\n\n          In   this   context,  McCleskey's   cause-and-prejudice\n                                         \n\nstandard plainly requires the  dismissal of claims raised  in the\n\n1990  Petition  that   Watkins  failed  to  raise  in   the  1979\n\nPetition.4   To justify the  failure to raise  a claim, appellant\n\nmust demonstrate  that some  \"external impediment, whether  it be\n\ngovernment  interference or the  reasonable unavailability of the\n\nfactual  basis for  the  claim, must  have  prevented [him]  from\n\nraising the claim.\"  McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1472.  Watkins also\n                              \n\nfailed  to demonstrate that  he made  a \"reasonable  and diligent\n\ninvestigation aimed at including  all relevant claims and grounds\n\nfor relief in  the first federal habeas petition.\"   Id. at 1472.\n                                                        \n\nThis test forms the cause prong of the McCleskey test and Watkins\n                                                \n\nfailed  to meet  it.    Although  Watkins' counsel  asserted that\n\nWatkins could meet both prongs at the hearing before the district\n\ncourt on  the 1990 Petition, he never  explained how.  On appeal,\n\nWatkins  did  not  raise the  argument.    We  conclude that  the\n\nreasonable  doubt  and  second-degree murder  challenges  to  his\n\nconviction  were available  to Watkins  at the  time of  the 1979\n\nPetition and  that he  has shown  no cause  for failing to  raise\n\n                    \n\n4   Despite the age of this case there is no problem as McCleskey\n                                                                 \napplies retroactively.

To determine whether  a gross\n\nmiscarriage  of justice  would occur  if we  do not  consider the\n\nMcCleskey exception, we must look at appellant's claims.\n         \n\n          Watkins   first  challenges  the   trial  court's  jury\n\ninstructions on reasonable doubt.  He claims that four aspects of\n\nthe   instructions,   when    taken   together,   derogate    the\n\nCommonwealth's  burden of proof.   First, the  trial court stated\n\nthat  reasonable doubt  was  not \"foolish\"  or \"fanciful\"  doubt.\n\nSecond,  it suggested  that reasonable  doubt was  something less\n\nthan  a \"mathematical  or an  artificial  certainty.\"   Third, it\n\npresented its  instruction on essential  elements of a  crime, as\n\nopposed to collateral  issues, in a  confusing manner.   Finally,\n\nthe  trial court  stated that  \"the average  layman's version  of\n\n'reasonable doubt' would  come pretty  close to what  the law  in\n\nmuch more technical language says.\"  \n\n          While criminal defendants often  challenge instructions\n\non reasonable doubt, \"our experience has been that even imperfect\n\nformulations usually meet constitutional requirements when viewed\n\nin  the context of the  entire charge.\"   Lanigan v.

In this  case, the\n                    \n\ntrial  judge's instruction  on  reasonable doubt  were less  than\n\nperfect.   They were confusing in  parts, but do not  rise to the\n\nlevel of constitutional infirmity.  \n\n          The trial  court's statement with respect  to \"foolish\"\n\nor  \"fanciful\" doubt came close to the instruction we censured in\n\nDunn v.

In Dunn,  the trial court erred by shifting the\n                         \n\nburden to the  defendant.   It stated that  reasonable doubt  was\n\ndoubt  that could not \"readily or easily [be] explained away, but\n\nrather such  a strong  and abiding  conviction  as still  remains\n\nafter careful consideration of all the  facts and arguments . . .\n\n.\"  Id.    In this case, the trial court did not shift the burden\n       \n\nto defendant.   It stated that reasonable doubt was \"a doubt that\n\nresides in the mind of a  reasonable man who is earnestly seeking\n\nthe truth.   It is not  a foolish doubt.   It  is not a  fanciful\n\ndoubt.  It is  not a doubt in the  mind of a juror who  is simply\n\nseeking  an  excuse  to  acquit  a  defendant.\"    While  a  poor\n\nformulation,  this instruction  essentially asked  the jurors  to\n\nseriously pursue  the truth.   Appellant's  reliance  on Dunn  is\n                                                             \n\nmisplaced.   \n\n          With  respect to the  other errors alleged,  it is true\n\n                               -9-\n\nthat the trial judge indicated that a mathematical certainty  was\n\nnot possible.

Finally,\n\nthe  introductory comment  that the  layman's version  is \"pretty\n\nclose\" to  the law's  technical definition, even  when considered\n\nalong  side  the other  disputed  verbal  formulations, does  not\n\nprevent us from finding that the challenged aspects of the charge\n\ndid not  \"so infect the entire  charge and trial as  to cause the\n\njury to evaluate petitioner's guilt or innocence under a standard\n\nless  than 'beyond a reasonable doubt'.\"  Lanigan v.
