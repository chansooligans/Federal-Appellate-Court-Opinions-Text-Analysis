In September\n\n1981, Timberlane placed Kevin in a special educational program at\n\nCharlotte Avenue  School, a  public elementary school  in Nashua,\n\nNew  Hampshire.   Although Kevin's  parents originally  agreed to\n\nthis placement, they soon  expressed concerns to his teacher  and\n\nto Timberlane's special education  administration that Kevin  was\n\nregressing academically.  In  December 1981, after Kevin suffered\n\n                    \n\n     education.\"   20 U.S.C.    1412(1).

An IEP is a statement\n     of the  educational program  which must be  written for\n     each  child and  designed to  meet each  child's unique\n     needs.   20 U.S.C   1401(a) (19).  The IEP is developed\n     by a  team including a qualified  representative of the\n     local educational  agency, the teacher, the  parents or\n     guardian, and,  where appropriate,  the  student.

Kevin received no educational  services from Timberlane\n\nbetween January  1982 and January  1984, the  two-year period  to\n\nwhich  the compensatory  education claim  at issue  in  this case\n\nrelates.  Finally, in  January 1984, after a great  many meetings\n\nand an  abortive truancy  proceeding against Kevin's  father, the\n\nparties came to  an agreement on  Kevin's placement at  Pinkerton\n\nHigh School, where he remained through the 1988-89 school year.3\n\n          In the  fall of 1988,  Mr. Murphy and  Timberlane offi-\n\ncials had discussions concerning continuation  of Kevin's special\n\neducation beyond his twenty-first birthday  on July 9, 1989.  Mr.\n\nMurphy later  signed Kevin's  1988-89 IEP with  the understanding\n\nthat Kevin would be  provided special educational services beyond\n\nage  twenty-one.   On  January 5, 1989,  however, the  Timberlane\n\nschool board rejected a  request by the Timberlane superintendent\n\nto fund continued special education for Kevin.  On July 24, 1989,\n\nshortly  after  Kevin's  twenty-first  birthday,  George  Wright,\n\nTimberlane's representative  on  Kevin's IEP  team, notified  the\n\nMurphys  that Kevin  would be discharged  as a  special education\n\nstudent.\n\n          Kevin is  now twenty-five years  of age  and no  longer\n\nentitled to a free public education under New Hampshire law.

The Murphys\n\nmaintained that  Kevin was entitled  to compensatory  educational\n\nservices beyond  age twenty-one as a  consequence of Timberlane's\n\nfailure to  provide special education during  the two-year period\n\nfrom January 1982 through January 1984.  The Murphys specifically\n\nalleged that Timberlane  had violated the IDEA  by failing either\n\nto  propose an  IEP acceptable  to  all IEP  team  members or  to\n\ninitiate administrative proceedings to resolve the IEP impasse in\n\naccordance with N.H. Code Admin. R. Ed. 1125.01(b)(3)-b (\"section\n\n1125\").4\n\n          The administrative hearing officer determined  that the\n\nMurphys' claim  for compensatory educational services  was barred\n\nby laches.  The United States  District Court for the District of\n\nNew Hampshire  granted summary  judgment in favor  of Timberlane,\n\naffirming the  administrative decision.

Our review reveals no  abuse of discretion\n\n                                6\n\nby the district court.  See K-Mart Corp., 875 F.2d at 911.5\n                                        \n\n          Timberlane represented to the district court that \"most\n\nof the primary actors\" from the relevant period were unavailable,\n\nand  that  the  \"memories  of  critical  witnesses  had  failed.\"\n\nHowever,  two of  these  \"primary\" witnesses  (Kevin's  teachers:\n\nMartha Kadel and Claudia  Libis) testified at the district  court\n                                          \n\nhearing.  A third  key witness, Nikolas Sarbanis,  resides within\n\nthe  reach of the district court's subpoena power, yet Timberlane\n\ndid not produce  him.  Timberlane rested  its \"prejudice\" showing\n\nrelating  to  the  other  \"primary\"  witness,  former  Timberlane\n\nSuperintendent Robert Crompton, solely on its  unsupported asser-\n\ntion that  he  was  unavailable.   The  district  court  received\n\ntestimony, however, that Crompton resides in Florida, and Timber-\n\nlane  made no proffer  that he was either  unable or unwilling to\n\ntestify.   See Hoover v.  Department of Navy,  957 F.2d 861,  864\n                                            \n\n(Fed.

Thus, the  instant appeal  challenges the  district\n\ncourt  order allowing  the  compensatory education  claim on  the\n\nmerits.\n\n          This  tortuous  procedural  trail  is material  to  the\n\npresent  inquiry in at least two significant respects.  First, in\n\ncontradistinction to  the \"typical\"  IDEA action, this  case does\n\n                                12\n\nnot concern the appropriate limitation to be applied to an appeal\n\nfrom a  state administrative ruling  to a federal  district court\n\nunder  20 U.S.C.   1415(e)(2), but to the initiation of a request\n\nfor an  \"impartial due  process\" administrative hearing  under 20\n\nU.S.C.   1415(b)(2) in the first instance.  Compare, e.g., Amann,\n                                                                \n\n991 F.2d  at 933-34  (importing 30-day limitation  from Massachu-\n\nsetts Administrative  Procedure Act  in   1415(e)(2) case);  Bow,\n                                                                \n\n750 F. Supp. at  550-51  (similar, applying 30-day  New Hampshire\n\nadministrative  review limitation).7    Second,  we believe  that\n\nseveral factors which militate in favor of borrowing an  abbrevi-\n\nated  limitation period  for  application in  the  context of  an\n\nappeal from an administrative ruling under section 1415(e)(2) are\n\ninapposite in the present  context.  For instance, where  a party\n\nseeks  administrative review in  order to resolve  an ongoing IEP\n                                                             \n\nimpasse, the need for  a speedy resolution securing the  eligible\n                               \n\nchild's IDEA entitlement  at the earliest  possible time must  be\n\nconsidered  a dominant IDEA policy objective.  Amann, 991 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n932.  The present action, on the other hand, concerns a claim for\n\ncompensatory education  based exclusively on a  course of conduct\n\nalready concluded, and thus does not implicate an equivalent need\n                 \n\nfor urgent administrative intervention.  Furthermore, whereas the\n\nlimitation borrowed in this case will govern whether the Murphys'\n\n                    \n\n     7The thirty-day  limitation borrowed in Bow  appears to have\n                                                \nbeen supplanted by a  newly enacted limitation scheme, applicable\nexclusively in the special education  context.  The new provision\nprescribes  a  120-day limitation  on  any \"appeal  from  a final\nadministrative  decision  in  a  special  education  due  process\nhearing to a court  of competent jurisdiction.\"  N.H.

Supp. at 549.  Consequently, the  statute of limita-\n   \n\ntions defense interposed by  Timberlane would not merely preclude\n\na judicial \"second look\" at an adverse administrative ruling, but\n\nforeclose any ruling, administrative or judicial, on Timberlane's\n                                                \n\nlegal  responsibility for  the  otherwise irretrievable  two-year\n\nIDEA educational entitlement denied Kevin.\n\n          Thus,  the broad equitable  considerations and finality\n\nconcerns generated  by  the  present  action     where  absent  a\n\ncompensatory  education award there can be no \"next year\" for the\n\ndisabled individual no longer  eligible for free public education\n\n   are not ordinarily involved in an appeal to the district court\n\nunder  section 1415(e)(2).  Compare Amann, 991 F.2d at 933 (hold-\n                                         \n\ning short limitation period  appropriate, in part because parents\n\ncan always contest next year's proceedings if need be).  We think\n                              \n\nthese  considerations bear out the view endorsed by the Bow court\n                                                           \n\nthat  \"[n]othing  prevents  different  provisions  of  a  federal\n\nstatute  from being  characterized  differently  for  statute  of\n\nlimitation purposes.\"  Bow,  750 F.

Further, the\n                  \n\nopening proviso     \"[e]xcept as  otherwise provided  by law\"    \n\n                    \n\n     8Even  if the  present claim  were somehow  considered tort-\nbased,  the required  \"borrowing\" methodology does  not encourage\nrecourse to state limitations tailored to curtail public liabili-\nty.   See, e.g., Wilson, 471  U.S. at 279 (noting,  in context of\n                       \n  1983 action, that \"the  very ineffectiveness of state remedies\"\nmay  have  motivated Congress  to  impose  a federal  enforcement\nscheme  against  state actors);  cf.

Compare,  e.g.,  N.H.  Rev. Stat.  Ann.\n                                        \n\n  507-C:4 (providing two-year limitation on actions  for \"medical\n\ninjury\"); N.H.  Rev. Stat. Ann.    508:4-B (providing  eight-year\n\nlimitation on actions for \"damages from construction\").\n\n          As an  IDEA-based claim  for compensatory education  is\n\nsimilar to a civil rights action, the \"borrowing\" praxis also may\n\nbe informed  by relevant principles  developed in the  context of\n\ncivil  actions under  42 U.S.C.     1981 and  1983.   The Supreme\n\nCourt  has identified  a general  preference for  borrowing state\n\nlimitations governing  personal injury actions,  Wilson, 471 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  279 (  1983 action), in  part because \"[i]t  is most unlikely\n\nthat  the period  of limitations  applicable to  [personal injury\n\nactions] ever  was, or ever would  be, fixed in a  way that would\n\ndiscriminate  against federal  claims,  or  be inconsistent  with\n                                                                 \n\nfederal  law in any respect.\"   Id.

Under this\n                                   \n\ncriterion, as between RSA 507-B:7 and RSA 508:4    the statute of\n\nlimitations  governing personal  actions  generally     RSA 508:4\n\npresents the more analogous New Hampshire statute under the \"like\n\naction\"  test established in Campbell, 155 U.S. at 616, hence the\n                                     \n\nmore appropriate for  application to the IDEA claim for compensa-\n\ntory education in the present case.9  Cf.

Likewise, in  the\n\npresent  context the borrowing praxis  must take into account the\n\ncentral importance  of  the IDEA's  procedural overlay.   As  the\n\nSupreme  Court has observed, procedure is at the very core of the\n\nIDEA:\n\n          It seems  to us  no exaggeration to  say that\n          Congress placed every bit as much emphasis on\n          compliance with procedures giving parents and\n          guardians  a  large measure  of participation\n          . . . as  it did upon the  measurement of the\n          resulting IEP against a substantive standard.\n\nBoard  of Educ. v.

We\n\ncannot  overlook  the  reality  that  a  central  federal  policy\n\nunderlying the  IDEA,  and  an  important feature  of  the  IDEA-\n\nimplementing  scheme adopted  in  New Hampshire,  have both  been\n\nblunted.  Thus, absent a more particular limitation applicable to\n\nthis  extraordinary compensatory  education  claim,  we think  it\n\nappropriate  to borrow  the  New  Hampshire catch-all  limitation\n\napplicable to personal actions generally.11\n\n          In addition,  the  more abbreviated  the limitation  on\n\ncompensatory  education claims  the  greater the  disincentive to\n\n                    \n\n     11The  availability of  compensatory education  as  a remedy\nunder the  IDEA    the  one form  of IDEA relief  that holds  any\npotential for  redressing this  deprivation    has  only recently\nbeen recognized in this Circuit, see Pihl, 9 F.3d  at 187-89; and\n                                         \nonly  a year earlier in the District of New Hampshire, Manchester\n                                                                 \nSch.

The first reported court of  appeals case to recognize a\ncompensatory education claim is Miener v. Missouri, 800 F.2d 749,\n                                                  \n753 (8th  Cir.  1986).

The resultant  undermining  of section  1125 would  be\n\nparticularly erosive of IDEA  policy in New Hampshire.   Once the\n\nIEP  negotiations had  remained  at an  impasse for  a reasonable\n\nperiod  of time, i.e., not  long into the  two-year period during\n                     \n\nwhich he received no  special education, the onus was  on Timber-\n\nlane to  obtain administrative approval  to implement the  IEP it\n\nconsidered appropriate for Kevin.

Although Hall  is distinguishable  from the  present\n                          \n\naction on a  number of  grounds, the most  cogent distinction  is\n\nthat the present dispute  involves a total denial of  all special\n                                          \n\neducation services for an  extended period of time, not  merely a\n\nchallenge  to the appropriateness  of special  education services\n                                 \n\nprovided  years  earlier.

As with the methodology for borrowing a limitation from\n\nstate law, no mechanical  formula controls the accrual determina-\n\ntion:  \"Where a statute does  not indicate when a cause of action\n\naccrues, the  court must 'keep[] in mind the purpose of the [Act]\n\nand the practical ends to be served by a period of limitations.'\"\n\nG.D.,  783 F.

Compare, e.g.,  Amann,\n                                                                \n\n991  F.2d at 933-34  (involving an appeal  from an administrative\n\ndecision and noting under  Massachusetts law that limitation runs\n\nfrom \"receipt of notice  of final decision\"); G.D., 783  F.

We need not fix the precise date\n\nof accrual,  however,  since the  Murphys'  claim  unquestionably\n\naccrued within  the six-year  period preceding their  request for\n\nadministrative review on August 20, 1989.   Thus, the request for\n\nadministrative  review  was  timely whether  accrual  occurred in\n\nOctober  of  1983 upon  Kevin's  initial trial  placement  at the\n\nPinkerton school (as Timberlane  urged below), or at the  time he\n\nwas  permanently placed  in  January  of  1984  (as  the  Murphys\n\nclaimed), or at some intermediate time.   Moreover, from whatever\n\npoint in time  within the  two-year period the  Murphys might  be\n\n                                22\n\nfound to have known (or had reason to know) either of \"the injury\n\nor the event that is the basis for their [compensatory education]\n\nclaim,\" Hall, 941 F.2d at 408, Timberlane remained  in continuous\n            \n\nviolation of its section 1125 obligation to pursue an administra-\n\ntive resolution to the IEP stalemate.   Consequently, we conclude\n\nthat  Timberlane's ongoing  failure to  comply with  section 1125\n\nthroughout the relevant portion of the two-year period constitut-\n\ned  a  unitary violation  under the  IDEA  and the  New Hampshire\n\nimplementing regulation.\n\nC.  The Murphy Motion for Summary Judgment\n                                          \n\n          As  a  threshold  matter,  two  arguments  advanced  by\n\nTimberlane on  the  merits have  been  foreclosed by  our  recent\n\ndecision in Pihl v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 9 F.3d 184 (1st\n                                                \n\nCir. 1993), recognizing a  compensatory education claim under the\n\nIDEA, id. at 187-89, notwithstanding  that the student was beyond\n         \n\nthe eligible age  for a free  education under  state law, id.  at\n                                                             \n\n189-90.  Thus, two further issues remain unaddressed. \n\n     1.   Section 1125\n                      \n\n          The district court  held Timberlane liable  for failing\n\nto  fulfill its section 1125 responsibility  either to present an\n\nacceptable IEP or seek  administrative enforcement.  The district\n\ncourt  simply applied  our  own  straightforward construction  of\n\nsection 1125:\n\n          In  New  Hampshire, if  the  parents disagree\n          with a proposed IEP and the local educational\n          agency feels it would be in the best interest\n          of the child to  implement the IEP, the local\n\n                                23\n\n          agency is required to initiate administrative\n                            \n          procedures to obtain  permission from a hear-\n          ing officer to implement  the IEP.

The IDEA invests\n\nexpansive  discretion  in the  states  to  structure implementing\n\nprocedures  and  enforcement  mechanisms, thereby  constructively\n\nincorporating duly promulgated state regulations:\n\n                    \n\n     12Timberlane  also  argues  that  section  1125  is  invalid\nbecause  it imposes  on  the school  district obligations  beyond\nthose authorized either by  the IDEA or the New  Hampshire imple-\nmenting statute.   Neither  argument is  persuasive.  First,  the\nIDEA and its companion regulations merely establish  foundational\nrequirements     states may impose more  stringent procedural and\nsubstantive  requirements.   See  Burlington,  736  F.2d at  789.\n                                            \nSecond, section 1125 is well within the broad authority conferred\nupon the New  Hampshire Board of Education  to promulgate regula-\ntions under  the  IDEA.   See  N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.     186-C:16\n                             \n(authorizing, inter  alia, regulations  governing appeals  of IEP\n                         \nteam  decisions  and  regulations  relating  to  \"other  matters\"\npertinent to implementation of the IDEA).\n\n                                24\n\n          [S]tate  standards,  be  they substantive  or\n          procedural,  that  exceed  the federal  basic\n          floor  of meaningful,  beneficial educational\n          opportunity . . . . will operate to determine\n          what an appropriate  education requires for a\n          particular child in a given state.\n\nId. at 789  (footnotes omitted); accord David D., 775 F.2d at 417\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir. 1985)  (it is  \"beyond cavil  that the  federal [IDEA]\n\nstandard  explicitly incorporates\" certain  state standards); Doe\n                                                                 \n\nv.

It is  plainly true, of course,\n\nas  Timberlane  argues, that  not  every procedural  irregularity\n\ngives rise to liability under the IDEA.  Nevertheless, \"procedur-\n\nal inadequacies [that have]  compromised the pupil's right  to an\n\nappropriate education . . . or caused a deprivation of education-\n\nal benefits\" are the stuff of successful IDEA actions.  Roland M.\n                                                                 \n\nv. Concord  Sch.

And that  is\n                            \n\nexactly what happened here.\n\n          We  emphasized in  Murphy I  that whereas  \"parents are\n                                     \n\nentitled to request a hearing if they disagree with an IEP, state\n\nregulations impose  upon Timberlane not  only the right,  but the\n\nobligation  to  do  the same.\"    973  F.2d  at 17  (emphasis  in\n          \n\noriginal).13    Thus, by  its  longstanding  procedural lapse  in\n\n                    \n\n     13Timberlane's  misconceptions about the  IDEA are betrayed,\nas  much as anything, by  the contention that  its institution of\ntruancy proceedings should be  considered the rough equivalent of\nthe  administrative  adjudication  required  under  section 1125.\nEven assuming that Timberlane had done something more than merely\nfile  the truancy  petition,  a  coercive adversarial  proceeding\nagainst a parent is no substitute for a substantive review of the\nspecial educational needs of the handicapped child.\n\n                                25\n\nfailing  to  initiate  administrative review  as  required  under\n\nsection 1125,  Timberlane abdicated its responsibility  to termi-\n\nnate  the IEP  impasse preventing  Kevin's access  to a  free and\n\nappropriate  education.   We  think  a  procedural default  which\n\npermits a disabled child's entitlement to a  free and appropriate\n\neducation to go unmet for two years constitutes sufficient ground\n\nfor liability under the IDEA.  See, e.g., W.G., 960  F.2d at 1484\n                                              \n\n(when severe procedural  flaws infect IEP process an  action lies\n\nunder IDEA);   Roland M.,  910 F.2d at  994 (same); Mrs.  C., 916\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 72-73 (same); cf. Hampton Sch. Dist. v.

Summary Judgment\n                         \n\n          Lastly,   Timberlane  claims  that  genuine  issues  of\n\nmaterial  fact precluded  summary judgment  as to  whether:   (1)\n\nKevin's parents were intransigent and at least partly responsible\n\nfor  interrupting Kevin's  education,  and  (2)  the  educational\n\nservices  Timberlane provided from  1985 to 1989  were \"more than\n\nappropriate,\"  and  thus  compensated for  the  educational  loss\n\noccasioned during 1982-84.   The party resisting summary judgment\n\n\"may not rest  upon the mere allegations or denials  of the . . .\n\npleadings, but . . .  must set forth specific  facts showing that\n\nthere  is a  genuine issue for  trial.\"   Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(e).\n\nThere is no  trialworthy issue unless there  is sufficient compe-\n\ntent  evidence to  enable  a finding  favorable  to the  opposing\n\nparty.   Anderson  v.  Liberty Lobby,  Inc.,  477 U.S.  242,  248\n                                           \n\n                                26\n\n(1986).\n\n          A painstaking review of the  entire record has not dis-\n\nclosed, nor does Timberlane  identify, any evidence sufficient to\n\ngenerate a genuine  factual issue as  to either contention,  even\n\nassuming  their  materiality.14    Instead,  consistent  with its\n\nprior  strategy, Timberlane  elected to  try to fend  off summary\n\njudgment through recourse to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), which permits\n\na party  to establish,  by affidavit, that  evidence which  would\n                                                                 \n\ndemonstrate a trialworthy issue is for some valid reason unavail-\n\nable.   See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56; see also James  W. Moore et al.,\n                                         \n\nMoore's  Federal  Practice     56.22-56.24  (1993).    Timberlane\n                          \n\nrelied  entirely on  its contention,  unsubstantiated by  the re-\n\nquired  affidavit,15 that  it needed  \"an opportunity  to conduct\n\n                    \n\n     14The first  hurdle  confronting Timberlane,  of course,  is\nthat parental intransigence would not absolve the school district\nof its responsibility  under section 1125.   Indeed, section 1125\ntargets intransigence.   See Murphy I,  973 F.2d at 17;  supra p.\n                                                              \n23.  Thus, Timberlane  can demonstrate no issue of  material fact\n                                                            \nin this regard.  But neither has it demonstrated  a genuine issue\n                                                           \nof  fact.    Although  the record  contains  several  \"sarcastic\"\nletters from Mr. Murphy to  Mr. Sarbanis, Timberlane presented no\nevidence suggesting  anything  more than  that Mr.  Murphy was  a\ntenacious and zealous advocate for his son's interests.   Summary\njudgment should not be disturbed on so fragile a claim, especial-\nly as two school district representatives praised Mr. Murphy as a\ncooperative and concerned, indeed model, parent.  Even though Mr.\nSarbanis,  the one school district official  with whom Mr. Murphy\nclearly  had a stormy relationship, still lives in New Hampshire,\nTimberlane presented  no affidavit  from Sarbanis.   And although\nTimberlane's  pleadings are  replete  with allegations  that  Mr.\nMurphy was  intransigent, \"[b]rash  conjecture, coupled  with the\nhope that something concrete will materialize, is insufficient to\nblock summary judgment.\"   Dow  v. United Bhd.  of Carpenters,  1\n                                                             \nF.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     15Given that the district  court had already rejected essen-\ntially  these same  contentions, advanced  in support  of Timber-\nlane's laches defense, see  supra pp. 6-8, the failure  to comply\n                                 \n\n                                27\n\ndiscovery to reconstruct [the]  chronology [of Kevin's education]\n\nand  to fill in critical gaps about events which occurred before,\n\nduring and after  the years  in question[,]\" and  to \"depose  the\n\nout-of-state witnesses.\"\n\n          The district  court  rejected Timberlane's  Rule  56(f)\n\ninitiative,  on  the  ground that  the  evidence  adduced  at the\n\nhearing on  the laches  defense demonstrated that  Timberlane had\n\nmade no serious  effort to  present its putative  evidence.   The\n\ncourt  accordingly ruled  that Timberlane  could not  take refuge\n\nfrom  summary judgment under Rule 56(f) since the memories of its\n\nwitnesses were available for  affidavit purposes in opposition to\n\nthe  Murphys' motion for summary judgment.  The Rule 56(f) deter-\n\nmination is reviewed for  abuse of discretion.  First  Nat'l Bank\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Shortly thereafter\n\nthe  Murphys filed  their  motion for  summary  judgment.   Thus,\n\nalthough it  had  clear  notice that  the  district  court  would\n\nproceed to the merits, Timberlane made the  strategic decision to\n\n                    \n\nwith the Rule  56(f) affidavit requirement was  no mere technical\nlapse.  See Hebert v.

The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndeclining  to credit  or  revisit the  flawed premise  underlying\n\nTimberlane's Rule 56(f) motion.\n\n                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court\n\norder  disallowing defendant-appellant's defenses  and affirm the\n\njudgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                29\n",

In September 1981, Timberlane placed Kevin in a special educational program at Charlotte Avenue School, a public elementary school in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Although Kevin's parents originally agreed to this placement, they soon expressed concerns to his teacher and to Timberlane's special education administration that Kevin was regressing academically.  In December 1981, after Kevin suffered a seizure at home, his parents decided not to return him to school.  Kevin received no educational services from Timberlane between January 1982 and January 1984, the two-year period to which the compensatory education claim at issue in this case relates.  Finally, in January 1984, after a great many meetings and an abortive truancy proceeding against Kevin's father, the parties came to an agreement on Kevin's placement at Pinkerton High School, where he remained through the 1988-89 school year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1988, Mr. Murphy and Timberlane officials had discussions concerning continuation of Kevin's special education beyond his twenty-first birthday on July 9, 1989.  Mr. Murphy later signed Kevin's 1988-89 IEP with the understanding that Kevin would be provided special educational services beyond age twenty-one.  On January 5, 1989, however, the Timberlane school board rejected a request by the Timberlane superintendent to fund continued special education for Kevin.  On July 24, 1989, shortly after Kevin's twenty-first birthday, George Wright, Timberlane's representative on Kevin's IEP team, notified the Murphys that Kevin would be discharged as a special education student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kevin is now twenty-five years of age and no longer entitled to a free public education under New Hampshire law.  See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 186-C:9 (disabled \"child shall be entitled to continue in an approved program until such time as the child has acquired a high school diploma or has attained the age of 21, whichever occurs first\");  see also id. Sec. 186-C:2 (similar).  In August 1989, less than one month after Kevin had been discharged, the Murphys requested an administrative hearing.  The Murphys maintained that Kevin was entitled to compensatory educational services beyond age twenty-one as a consequence of Timberlane's failure to provide special education during the two-year period from January 1982 through January 1984.  The Murphys specifically alleged that Timberlane had violated the IDEA by failing either to propose an IEP acceptable to all IEP team members or to initiate administrative proceedings to resolve the IEP impasse in accordance with N.H.Code Admin.R.Ed. 1125.01(b)(3)-b (\"section 1125\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative hearing officer determined that the Murphys' claim for compensatory educational services was barred by laches.

Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir.1989)).  We went on to hold that \"the Murphys' delay in filing their claim was not so unreasonable as to make the laches defense available without a clear showing of prejudice.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  On remand, the district court found that the delay had not prejudiced Timberlane's ability to present its case as a result of the unavailability or failed memories of key witnesses.  Murphy II, 819 F.Supp. at 1133.   Our review reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.  See K-Mart Corp., 875 F.2d at 911.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberlane represented to the district court that \"most of the primary actors\" from the relevant period were unavailable, and that the \"memories of critical witnesses had failed.\"   However, two of these \"primary\" witnesses (Kevin's teachers:  Martha Kadel and Claudia Libis) testified at the district court hearing.  A third key witness, Nikolas Sarbanis, resides within the reach of the district court's subpoena power, yet Timberlane did not produce him.  Timberlane rested its \"prejudice\" showing relating to the other \"primary\" witness, former Timberlane Superintendent Robert Crompton, solely on its unsupported assertion that he was unavailable.  The district court received testimony, however, that Crompton resides in Florida, and Timberlane made no proffer that he was either unable or unwilling to testify.  See Hoover v. Department of Navy, 957 F.2d 861, 864 (Fed.Cir.1992) (noting that \"prejudice\" showing must be supported by \"substantial evidence\" and holding, on similar facts, that this burden \"is not met simply by showing that a potential witness has retired\" outside the subpoena power of the court.)   Moreover, Timberlane did not assert, let alone show, that Crompton's testimony would not be available by deposition.  See, e.g., Fairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v. Dwek, 970 F.2d 990, 994-95 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining requirements for the introduction of deposition testimony when witnesses are unavailable, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further found that Timberlane had failed to take reasonable steps to refresh its witnesses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>At the [district court] hearing, [six Timberlane witnesses] testified on ... direct examination as to aspects of their involvement with Kevin's special education program which they could not remember.

The present IDEA claim seeks to vindicate Kevin's \"right to a free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1412(1);  see also 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1412(2)(B), based on the contention that Kevin was deprived of educational services for two years while Timberlane, contrary to its mandated duty under section 1125, failed to resort to the New Hampshire administrative process to resolve the impasse between Timberlane and the Murphys as to what constituted an \"appropriate education.\"   See generally Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 310, 108 S.Ct. 592, 597, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988) (finding IDEA \"confers upon disabled children an enforceable substantive right to public education\").

The administrative hearing officer initially ruled that the Murphys' hearing application was timely under the New Hampshire statute of limitations governing \"personal actions\" in general, see N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 508:4, and therefore that the compensatory education claim should be addressed on the merits.  Later, on reconsideration, the hearing officer ruled that the compensatory education claim was barred by laches.  The Murphys filed a timely appeal to the district court from the administrative ruling on laches pursuant to 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2), and the district court upheld the administrative ruling.  On appeal, we vacated the district court decision and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened an evidentiary hearing on laches, and presumably in light of the circumstances of the case--Kevin was approaching his mid-twenties by this point, the litigation had been pending for more than three years, and an extensive district court evidentiary record had already been generated--the district court decided to adjudicate the Murphys' compensatory education claim on the merits rather than remand to the administrative hearing officer.  See 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2) (courts sitting in review of administrative rulings may supplement the hearing record with additional evidence);  Pihl v. Massachusetts Dept. of Educ., 9 F.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir.1993) (remand to administrative hearing officer may not be required where the record contains sufficient factual development and the \"peculiar expertise\" of a hearing officer is not required).  Neither party opposed the district court's decision to address the merits.  Thus, the instant appeal challenges the district court order allowing the compensatory education claim on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This tortuous procedural trail is material to the present inquiry in at least two significant respects.  First, in contradistinction to the \"typical\" IDEA action, this case does not concern the appropriate limitation to be applied to an appeal from a state administrative ruling to a federal district court under 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2), but to the initiation of a request for an \"impartial due process\" administrative hearing under 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(b)(2) in the first instance.  Compare, e.g., Amann, 991 F.2d at 933-34 (importing 30-day limitation from Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act in Sec. 1415(e)(2) case);  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 550-51 (similar, applying 30-day New Hampshire administrative review limitation).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Second, we believe that several factors which militate in favor of borrowing an abbreviated limitation period for application in the context of an appeal from an administrative ruling under section 1415(e)(2) are inapposite in the present context.  For instance, where a party seeks administrative review in order to resolve an ongoing IEP impasse, the need for a speedy resolution securing the eligible child's IDEA entitlement at the earliest possible time must be considered a dominant IDEA policy objective.  Amann, 991 F.2d at 932.   The present action, on the other hand, concerns a claim for compensatory education based exclusively on a course of conduct already concluded, and thus does not implicate an equivalent need for urgent administrative intervention.  Furthermore, whereas the limitation borrowed in this case will govern whether the Murphys' compensatory education claim can ever be considered by any tribunal in the first instance, in a section 1415(e)(2) proceeding the district court normally functions something like an appellate court reviewing a state agency decision on the merits.  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 549.   Consequently, the statute of limitations defense interposed by Timberlane would not merely preclude a judicial \"second look\" at an adverse administrative ruling, but foreclose any ruling, administrative or judicial, on Timberlane's legal responsibility for the otherwise irretrievable two-year IDEA educational entitlement denied Kevin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the broad equitable considerations and finality concerns generated by the present action--where absent a compensatory education award there can be no \"next year\" for the disabled individual no longer eligible for free public education--are not ordinarily involved in an appeal to the district court under section 1415(e)(2).  Compare Amann, 991 F.2d at 933 (holding short limitation period appropriate, in part because parents can always contest next year's proceedings if need be).  We think these considerations bear out the view endorsed by the Bow court that \"[n]othing prevents different provisions of a federal statute from being characterized differently for statute of limitation purposes.\"  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 549, citing Wilson, 471 U.S. at 268, 105 S.Ct. at 1943.   Under the required \"borrowing\" methodology, therefore, we weigh the federal interests manifest in the IDEA, the state and school district interests implicit in section 1125, and the interests of the learning disabled pupil and his family, all in light of the particular procedural posture and equitable considerations disclosed in the present record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The Appropriate New Hampshire Limitation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberlane advocates borrowing the four-year limitation applicable to \"Actions to Recover For Bodily Injury\" against local governmental units, including school districts.  See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 507-B:7 (\"RSA 507-B:7\") (amended to three-year period, effective in actions arising after May 17, 1989).  An alternate candidate is the New Hampshire statute of limitations which formerly prescribed a six-year limitation on \"personal actions\" accruing prior to July 1, 1986.  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 508:4 (\"RSA 508:4\") (amended to three-year period, effective in actions arising after July 1, 1986).  As the present cause of action accrued before RSA 508:4 and RSA 507-B:7 were amended, see infra p. 1194, the pre-amendment versions govern.  See Gonsalves v. Flynn, 981 F.2d 45, 47-48 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that federal \"borrowing\" court will respect state law provision prescribing exclusively prospective application of amendatory limitation), citing Kadar Corp. v. Milbury, 549 F.2d 230, 234 n. 3 (1st Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it clear that RSA 507-B:7 does not meet the threshold \"like action\" test, see Campbell, 155 U.S. at 616, 15 S.Ct. at 219-20, because it applies only in actions \"to recover for bodily injury, personal injury, or property damage caused by\" fault attributable to a governmental unit.  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 507-B:2.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court has observed:  \"Taken as a whole, the law [RSA 507:B] seems designed to limit municipal liability arising from tort suits and related personal property claims....\"  Cannata v. Deerfield, 132 N.H. 235, 566 A.2d 162, 167 (1989).  The Murphys' compensatory education claim, on the other hand, is premised on allegations that Timberlane denied Kevin's federal statutory rights by withholding all special education services for a two-year period in violation of the IDEA and section 1125, the New Hampshire implementing regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, certain extraordinary characteristics of the present compensatory education claim point up the appropriateness of the New Hampshire catch-all limitation applicable to \"personal actions\" generally.  Prior to its amendment in 1986, RSA 508:4 stated:  \"Except as otherwise provided by law, all personal actions, except actions for slander or libel, may be brought only within 6 years of the time the cause of action accrued.\"   Although we have found no precise definition of the term \"personal actions,\" the New Hampshire Supreme Court often has described RSA 508:4 as a \"general statute of limitations,\" see, e.g., Petition of Keene Sentinel, 136 N.H. 121, 612 A.2d 911, 914 (1992);  Clark v. Exeter Co-operative Bank, 115 N.H. 388, 344 A.2d 5, 5 (1975).  Further, the opening proviso--\"[e]except as otherwise provided by law\"--strongly suggests that RSA 508:4 is meant to serve as a \"backstop\" limitation on civil actions not governed by some more particular limitation.  Compare, e.g., N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 507-C:4 (providing two-year limitation on actions for \"medical injury\");  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 508:4-b (providing eight-year limitation on actions for \"damages from construction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an IDEA-based claim for compensatory education is similar to a civil rights action, the \"borrowing\" praxis also may be informed by relevant principles developed in the context of civil actions under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1983.  The Supreme Court has identified a general preference for borrowing state limitations governing personal injury actions, Wilson, 471 U.S. at 279, 105 S.Ct. at 1949 (Sec. 1983 action), in part because \"[i]t is most unlikely that the period of limitations applicable to [personal injury actions] ever was, or ever would be, fixed in a way that would discriminate against federal claims, or be inconsistent with federal law in any respect.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Under this criterion, as between RSA 507-B:7 and RSA 508:4--the statute of limitations governing personal actions generally--RSA 508:4 presents the more analogous New Hampshire statute under the \"like action\" test established in Campbell, 155 U.S. at 616, 15 S.Ct. at 219-20, hence the more appropriate for application to the IDEA claim for compensatory education in the present case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Cf. Lillios v. Justices of New Hampshire Dist. Court, 735 F.Supp. 43, 48 &amp; n. 9 (D.N.H.1990) (RSA 508:4 provides limitation applicable to Sec. 1983 actions brought in New Hampshire).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether borrowing RSA 508:4 comports with the purposes underlying the IDEA and the New Hampshire implementing regulation.  See Wilson, 471 U.S. at 266-67, 105 S.Ct. at 1942;  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 551.   The central purpose of the IDEA is to secure special educational entitlements to eligible recipients.  See 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400(b)(9) (\"it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of handicapped children in order to assure equal protection of the law\").  Likewise, in the present context the borrowing praxis must take into account the central importance of the IDEA's procedural overlay.  As the Supreme Court has observed, procedure is at the very core of the IDEA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>It seems to us no exaggeration to say that Congress placed every bit as much emphasis on compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation ... as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205-206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3050, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982);  accord W.G. v. Board of Trustees, 960 F.2d 1479, 1484 (9th Cir.1992) (noting centrality of implementing procedure to IDEA statutory scheme);  Mrs. C. v. Wheaton, 916 F.2d 69, 72-73 (2d Cir.1990) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core role of procedure in the IDEA setting is well illustrated by Timberlane's failure to initiate the required administrative proceedings, see N.H.Code Admin.R.Ed. 1125.01(b)(3)-b;  supra note 4, to end the IEP impasse in this case.  While parents and school officials dithered and debated, a disabled child with special educational needs lost day after irreplaceable day of educational opportunity mandated by law.  We cannot overlook the reality that a central federal policy underlying the IDEA, and an important feature of the IDEA-implementing scheme adopted in New Hampshire, have both been blunted.  Thus, absent a more particular limitation applicable to this extraordinary compensatory education claim, we think it appropriate to borrow the New Hampshire catch-all limitation applicable to personal actions generally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the more abbreviated the limitation on compensatory education claims the greater the disincentive to parents to shed an adversarial posture and get on with the business of cooperating with school officials to further the special-education needs of the child.  See David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., 775 F.2d 411, 424 (1st Cir.1985) (IDEA embodies preference for educational decisions arrived at through \"good-faith cooperation and negotiation among the parties\");  see also Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 16 (\"Obviously, the Murphys were not sitting on their rights, but were attempting to resolve their differences with the school district without resorting to litigation.\").  The resultant undermining of section 1125 would be particularly erosive of IDEA policy in New Hampshire.  Once the IEP negotiations had remained at an impasse for a reasonable period of time, i.e., not long into the two-year period during which he received no special education, the onus was on Timberlane to obtain administrative approval to implement the IEP it considered appropriate for Kevin.  See supra note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as noted above, most IDEA cases involve the borrowing of state statutes of limitations for application to judicial appeals from administrative decisions.  See Amann, 991 F.2d at 931 (collecting administrative review cases borrowing limitations ranging from thirty days to three years);   Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 548 (similar).  Careful research discloses but one case,  Hall v. Knott County Bd. of Educ., 941 F.2d 402 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 982, 117 L.Ed.2d 144 (1992), involving a compensatory education claim even roughly analogous to the Murphy claim.  The blind twenty-seven-year-old plaintiff in Hall brought an IDEA action challenging the appropriateness of the special educational services provided to her by the defendant school district between five and ten years earlier.  Id. at 404-06.   The Hall court assumed, arguendo, that a five-year limitation applied, but found the action time-barred in any event because it could not have accrued less than six years before the complaint was filed.  Id. at 408-09.   Although Hall is distinguishable from the present action on a number of grounds, the most cogent distinction is that the present dispute involves a total denial of all special education services for an extended period of time, not merely a challenge to the appropriateness of special education services provided years earlier.  Revisiting the appropriateness of special education services actually provided in school years long since passed may indeed be an exercise of \"extremely limited utility,\" as has been suggested,  see Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 550, but given the totality of the present deprivation the effort to evaluate the merits of the compensatory education claim in this case is both useful and far less problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) Accrual</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the question of accrual, which is governed by federal law.  Hall, 941 F.2d at 408;  G.D. v. Westmoreland Sch. Dist., 783 F.Supp. 1532, 1535 (D.N.H.1992) (same);  cf. Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir.1992) (same, Sec. 1983 case).  \"The general rule under federal law is said to be that [IDEA] claims 'accrue when the parents know or have reason to know of the injury or event that is the basis for their claim.' \"  Hall, 941 F.2d at 408 (quoting Judith W. Wegner, Educational Rights of Handicapped Children, 17 J. of L. &amp; Educ. 625, 654 (1988)).  As with the methodology for borrowing a limitation from state law, no mechanical formula controls the accrual determination:  \"Where a statute does not indicate when a cause of action accrues, the court must 'keep[ ] in mind the purpose of the [Act] and the practical ends to be served by a period of limitations.' \"  G.D., 783 F.Supp. at 1535 (alterations in original, quoting Albert v. Maine Cent. R.R., 905 F.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pinpointing accrual in the present case would pose a complex question, inasmuch as the Murphys' action challenges an entire course of conduct by Timberlane.  Compare, e.g., Amann, 991 F.2d at 933-34 (involving an appeal from an administrative decision and noting under Massachusetts law that limitation runs from \"receipt of notice of final decision\");  G.D., 783 F.Supp. at 1535-36 (similar, N.H. law).  We need not fix the precise date of accrual, however, since the Murphys' claim unquestionably accrued within the six-year period preceding their request for administrative review on August 20, 1989.  Thus, the request for administrative review was timely whether accrual occurred in October of 1983 upon Kevin's initial trial placement at the Pinkerton school (as Timberlane urged below), or at the time he was permanently placed in January of 1984 (as the Murphys claimed), or at some intermediate time.  Moreover, from whatever point in time within the two-year period the Murphys might be found to have known (or had reason to know) either of \"the injury or the event that is the basis for their [compensatory education] claim,\" Hall, 941 F.2d at 408, Timberlane remained in continuous violation of its section 1125 obligation to pursue an administrative resolution to the IEP stalemate.  Consequently, we conclude that Timberlane's ongoing failure to comply with section 1125 throughout the relevant portion of the two-year period constituted a unitary violation under the IDEA and the New Hampshire implementing regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Murphy Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, two arguments advanced by Timberlane on the merits have been foreclosed by our recent decision in Pihl v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 9 F.3d 184 (1st Cir.1993), recognizing a compensatory education claim under the IDEA, id. at 187-89, notwithstanding that the student was beyond the eligible age for a free education under state law, id. at 189-90.   Thus, two further issues remain unaddressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Section 1125</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held Timberlane liable for failing to fulfill its section 1125 responsibility either to present an acceptable IEP or seek administrative enforcement.  The district court simply applied our own straightforward construction of section 1125:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>In New Hampshire, if the parents disagree with a proposed IEP and the local educational agency feels it would be in the best interest of the child to implement the IEP, the local agency is required to initiate administrative procedures to obtain permission from a hearing officer to implement the IEP.  N.H.Code Admin.R.Ed. 1125.01(b)(3)-b.  No such procedures were ever initiated by Timberlane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 17 (footnote omitted &amp; emphasis added).  Under section 1125, the school district must take the initiative to ensure that intransigence and foot-dragging in the IEP process, whether bureaucratic or parental, do not indefinitely compromise the child's right to a free and appropriate public education.  See, e.g., W.G., 960 F.2d at 1486 (parental conduct does not waive responsibility of school district);  Town of Burlington v. Department of Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 795 (1st Cir.1984) (same), aff'd, 471 U.S. 359, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberlane's primary argument on appeal is that an IDEA claim, a federal cause of action, cannot be premised on a violation of a state administrative regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Its argument overlooks the IDEA framework and our case law.  The IDEA invests expansive discretion in the states to structure implementing procedures and enforcement mechanisms, thereby constructively incorporating duly promulgated state regulations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[S]tate standards, be they substantive or procedural, that exceed the federal basic floor of meaningful, beneficial educational opportunity.... will operate to determine what an appropriate education requires for a particular child in a given state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 789 (footnotes omitted);  accord David D., 775 F.2d at 417 (1st Cir.1985) (it is \"beyond cavil that the federal [IDEA] standard explicitly incorporates\" certain state standards);  Doe v. Board of Educ. of Tullahoma City Sch., 9 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir.1993) (same, citing cases).  It is plainly true, of course, as Timberlane argues, that not every procedural irregularity gives rise to liability under the IDEA.  Nevertheless, \"procedural inadequacies [that have] compromised the pupil's right to an appropriate education ... or caused a deprivation of educational benefits\" are the stuff of successful IDEA actions.  Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 994 (1st Cir.1990) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912, 111 S.Ct. 1122, 113 L.Ed.2d 230 (1991).  And that is exactly what happened here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasized in Murphy I that whereas \"parents are entitled to request a hearing if they disagree with an IEP, state regulations impose upon Timberlane not only the right, but the obligation to do the same.\"  973 F.2d at 17 (emphasis in original).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Thus, by its longstanding procedural lapse in failing to initiate administrative review as required under section 1125, Timberlane abdicated its responsibility to terminate the IEP impasse preventing Kevin's access to a free and appropriate education.  We think a procedural default which permits a disabled child's entitlement to a free and appropriate education to go unmet for two years constitutes sufficient ground for liability under the IDEA.  See, e.g., W.G., 960 F.2d at 1484 (when severe procedural flaws infect IEP process an action lies under IDEA);  Roland M., 910 F.2d at 994 (same);  Mrs. C., 916 F.2d at 72-73 (same);  cf. Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976 F.2d 48, 53-54 (1st Cir.1992) (technical IDEA violations may be insufficient to warrant setting aside IEP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Timberlane claims that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment as to whether:  (1) Kevin's parents were intransigent and at least partly responsible for interrupting Kevin's education, and (2) the educational services Timberlane provided from 1985 to 1989 were \"more than appropriate,\" and thus compensated for the educational loss occasioned during 1982-84.  The party resisting summary judgment \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the ... pleading, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).  There is no trialworthy issue unless there is sufficient competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the opposing party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A painstaking review of the entire record has not disclosed, nor does Timberlane identify, any evidence sufficient to generate a genuine factual issue as to either contention, even assuming their materiality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Instead, consistent with its prior strategy, Timberlane elected to try to fend off summary judgment through recourse to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), which permits a party to establish, by affidavit, that evidence which would demonstrate a trialworthy issue is for some valid reason unavailable.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56;  see also James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice pp 56.22-56.24 (1993).  Timberlane relied entirely on its contention, unsubstantiated by the required affidavit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> that it needed \"an opportunity to conduct discovery to reconstruct [the] chronology [of Kevin's education] and to fill in critical gaps about events which occurred before, during and after the years in question[,]\" and to \"depose the out-of-state witnesses.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Timberlane's Rule 56(f) initiative, on the ground that the evidence adduced at the hearing on the laches defense demonstrated that Timberlane had made no serious effort to present its putative evidence.  The court accordingly ruled that Timberlane could not take refuge from summary judgment under Rule 56(f) since the memories of its witnesses were available for affidavit purposes in opposition to the Murphys' motion for summary judgment.  The Rule 56(f) determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  First Nat'l Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 294, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1595, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968).  We find none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March of 1993, more than one month after the evidentiary hearing on the laches defense, the district court entered a scheduling order requiring the parties to submit \"law and/or evidence\" on the merits of the compensatory education claim--thereby plainly signaling its intention to proceed beyond the procedural defenses interposed by Timberlane.  Shortly thereafter the Murphys filed their motion for summary judgment.  Thus, although it had clear notice that the district court would proceed to the merits, Timberlane made the strategic decision to persist with its litigation position, viz., that it could not provide evidence because its witnesses (or their memories) were unavailable.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to credit or revisit the flawed premise underlying Timberlane's Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court order disallowing defendant-appellant's defenses and affirm the judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The IDEA formerly was known as the Education of the Handicapped Act.

Sec. 1412(1).

The IEP is developed by a team including a qualified representative of the local educational agency, the teacher, the parents or guardian, and, where appropriate, the student.  Id.  ... An IEP is appropriate under [the IDEA] if it provides instruction and support services which are reasonably calculated to confer educational benefits to the student.  Board of Education v.

Dist. v. Christopher B., 807 F.Supp. 860, 867-88 (D.N.H.1992).  The first reported court of appeals case to recognize a compensatory education claim is Miener v. Missouri, 800 F.2d 749, 753 (8th Cir.1986).  Thus, the recency and novelty of the compensatory education remedy likewise suggest that the catch-all limitation prescribed in RSA 508:4 is most suitable for borrowing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Timberlane also argues that section 1125 is invalid because it imposes on the school district obligations beyond those authorized either by the IDEA or the New Hampshire implementing statute.  Neither argument is persuasive.  First, the IDEA and its companion regulations merely establish foundational requirements--states may impose more stringent procedural and substantive requirements.  See Burlington, 736 F.2d at 789.   Second, section 1125 is well within the broad authority conferred upon the New Hampshire Board of Education to promulgate regulations under the IDEA.  See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 186-C:16 (authorizing, inter alia, regulations governing appeals of IEP team decisions and regulations relating to \"other matters\" pertinent to implementation of the IDEA)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Timberlane's misconceptions about the IDEA are betrayed, as much as anything, by the contention that its institution of truancy proceedings should be considered the rough equivalent of the administrative adjudication required under section 1125.  Even assuming that Timberlane had done something more than merely file the truancy petition, a coercive adversarial proceeding against a parent is no substitute for a substantive review of the special educational needs of the handicapped child</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The first hurdle confronting Timberlane, of course, is that parental intransigence would not absolve the school district of its responsibility under section 1125.  Indeed, section 1125 targets intransigence.  See Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 17;   supra p. 1195.  Thus, Timberlane can demonstrate no issue of material fact in this regard.  But neither has it demonstrated a genuine issue of fact.  Although the record contains several \"sarcastic\" letters from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Sarbanis, Timberlane presented no evidence suggesting anything more than that Mr. Murphy was a tenacious and zealous advocate for his son's interests.  Summary judgment should not be disturbed on so fragile a claim, especially as two school district representatives praised Mr. Murphy as a cooperative and concerned, indeed model, parent.  Even though Mr. Sarbanis, the one school district official with whom Mr. Murphy clearly had a stormy relationship, still lives in New Hampshire, Timberlane presented no affidavit from Sarbanis.  And although Timberlane's pleadings are replete with allegations that Mr. Murphy was intransigent, \"[b]rash conjecture, coupled with the hope that something concrete will materialize, is insufficient to block summary judgment.\"  Dow v.

See Hebert v.

In September 1981, Timberlane placed Kevin in a special educational program at Charlotte Avenue School, a public elementary school in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Although Kevin's parents originally agreed to this placement, they soon expressed concerns to his teacher and to Timberlane's special education administration that Kevin was regressing academically.  In December 1981, after Kevin suffered a seizure at home, his parents decided not to return him to school.  Kevin received no educational services from Timberlane between January 1982 and January 1984, the two-year period to which the compensatory education claim at issue in this case relates.  Finally, in January 1984, after a great many meetings and an abortive truancy proceeding against Kevin's father, the parties came to an agreement on Kevin's placement at Pinkerton High School, where he remained through the 1988-89 school year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1988, Mr. Murphy and Timberlane officials had discussions concerning continuation of Kevin's special education beyond his twenty-first birthday on July 9, 1989.

On January 5, 1989, however, the Timberlane school board rejected a request by the Timberlane superintendent to fund continued special education for Kevin.

Sec. 186-C:2 (similar).  In August 1989, less than one month after Kevin had been discharged, the Murphys requested an administrative hearing.  The Murphys maintained that Kevin was entitled to compensatory educational services beyond age twenty-one as a consequence of Timberlane's failure to provide special education during the two-year period from January 1982 through January 1984.  The Murphys specifically alleged that Timberlane had violated the IDEA by failing either to propose an IEP acceptable to all IEP team members or to initiate administrative proceedings to resolve the IEP impasse in accordance with N.H.Code Admin.R.Ed. 1125.01(b)(3)-b (\"section 1125\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative hearing officer determined that the Murphys' claim for compensatory educational services was barred by laches.

On remand, after receiving evidence and argument on both the laches defense and the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court rejected Timberlane's laches defense, denied its motion for summary judgment based on a statute of limitations defense, and granted summary judgment for the Murphys.

A third key witness, Nikolas Sarbanis, resides within the reach of the district court's subpoena power, yet Timberlane did not produce him.  Timberlane rested its \"prejudice\" showing relating to the other \"primary\" witness, former Timberlane Superintendent Robert Crompton, solely on its unsupported assertion that he was unavailable.  The district court received testimony, however, that Crompton resides in Florida, and Timberlane made no proffer that he was either unable or unwilling to testify.  See Hoover v.

The administrative hearing officer initially ruled that the Murphys' hearing application was timely under the New Hampshire statute of limitations governing \"personal actions\" in general, see N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 508:4, and therefore that the compensatory education claim should be addressed on the merits.  Later, on reconsideration, the hearing officer ruled that the compensatory education claim was barred by laches.  The Murphys filed a timely appeal to the district court from the administrative ruling on laches pursuant to 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2), and the district court upheld the administrative ruling.  On appeal, we vacated the district court decision and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened an evidentiary hearing on laches, and presumably in light of the circumstances of the case--Kevin was approaching his mid-twenties by this point, the litigation had been pending for more than three years, and an extensive district court evidentiary record had already been generated--the district court decided to adjudicate the Murphys' compensatory education claim on the merits rather than remand to the administrative hearing officer.  See 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2) (courts sitting in review of administrative rulings may supplement the hearing record with additional evidence);  Pihl v. Massachusetts Dept. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"657160\"><a href=\"/opinion/657160/karl-pihl-v-massachusetts-department-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 191 (1st Cir.1993) (remand to administrative hearing officer may not be required where the record contains sufficient factual development and the \"peculiar expertise\" of a hearing officer is not required).  Neither party opposed the district court's decision to address the merits.  Thus, the instant appeal challenges the district court order allowing the compensatory education claim on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This tortuous procedural trail is material to the present inquiry in at least two significant respects.  First, in contradistinction to the \"typical\" IDEA action, this case does not concern the appropriate limitation to be applied to an appeal from a state administrative ruling to a federal district court under 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(e)(2), but to the initiation of a request for an \"impartial due process\" administrative hearing under 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(b)(2) in the first instance.  Compare, e.g., Amann, 991 F.2d at 933-34 (importing 30-day limitation from Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act in Sec. 1415(e)(2) case);  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 550-51 (similar, applying 30-day New Hampshire administrative review limitation).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Second, we believe that several factors which militate in favor of borrowing an abbreviated limitation period for application in the context of an appeal from an administrative ruling under section 1415(e)(2) are inapposite in the present context.  For instance, where a party seeks administrative review in order to resolve an ongoing IEP impasse, the need for a speedy resolution securing the eligible child's IDEA entitlement at the earliest possible time must be considered a dominant IDEA policy objective.  Amann, 991 F.2d at 932.   The present action, on the other hand, concerns a claim for compensatory education based exclusively on a course of conduct already concluded, and thus does not implicate an equivalent need for urgent administrative intervention.  Furthermore, whereas the limitation borrowed in this case will govern whether the Murphys' compensatory education claim can ever be considered by any tribunal in the first instance, in a section 1415(e)(2) proceeding the district court normally functions something like an appellate court reviewing a state agency decision on the merits.  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 549.   Consequently, the statute of limitations defense interposed by Timberlane would not merely preclude a judicial \"second look\" at an adverse administrative ruling, but foreclose any ruling, administrative or judicial, on Timberlane's legal responsibility for the otherwise irretrievable two-year IDEA educational entitlement denied Kevin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the broad equitable considerations and finality concerns generated by the present action--where absent a compensatory education award there can be no \"next year\" for the disabled individual no longer eligible for free public education--are not ordinarily involved in an appeal to the district court under section 1415(e)(2).  Compare Amann, 991 F.2d at 933 (holding short limitation period appropriate, in part because parents can always contest next year's proceedings if need be).  We think these considerations bear out the view endorsed by the Bow court that \"[n]othing prevents different provisions of a federal statute from being characterized differently for statute of limitation purposes.\"  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 549, citing Wilson, 471 U.S. at 268, 105 S.Ct. at 1943.   Under the required \"borrowing\" methodology, therefore, we weigh the federal interests manifest in the IDEA, the state and school district interests implicit in section 1125, and the interests of the learning disabled pupil and his family, all in light of the particular procedural posture and equitable considerations disclosed in the present record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The Appropriate New Hampshire Limitation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberlane advocates borrowing the four-year limitation applicable to \"Actions to Recover For Bodily Injury\" against local governmental units, including school districts.

Prior to its amendment in 1986, RSA 508:4 stated:  \"Except as otherwise provided by law, all personal actions, except actions for slander or libel, may be brought only within 6 years of the time the cause of action accrued.\"   Although we have found no precise definition of the term \"personal actions,\" the New Hampshire Supreme Court often has described RSA 508:4 as a \"general statute of limitations,\" see, e.g., Petition of Keene Sentinel, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></span>, 914 (1992);  Clark v.

Further, the opening proviso--\"[e]except as otherwise provided by law\"--strongly suggests that RSA 508:4 is meant to serve as a \"backstop\" limitation on civil actions not governed by some more particular limitation.  Compare, e.g., N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 507-C:4 (providing two-year limitation on actions for \"medical injury\");  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 508:4-b (providing eight-year limitation on actions for \"damages from construction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an IDEA-based claim for compensatory education is similar to a civil rights action, the \"borrowing\" praxis also may be informed by relevant principles developed in the context of civil actions under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1983.  The Supreme Court has identified a general preference for borrowing state limitations governing personal injury actions, Wilson, 471 U.S. at 279, 105 S.Ct. at 1949 (Sec. 1983 action), in part because \"[i]t is most unlikely that the period of limitations applicable to [personal injury actions] ever was, or ever would be, fixed in a way that would discriminate against federal claims, or be inconsistent with federal law in any respect.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Under this criterion, as between RSA 507-B:7 and RSA 508:4--the statute of limitations governing personal actions generally--RSA 508:4 presents the more analogous New Hampshire statute under the \"like action\" test established in Campbell, 155 U.S. at 616, 15 S.Ct. at 219-20, hence the more appropriate for application to the IDEA claim for compensatory education in the present case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Cf.

See Wilson, 471 U.S. at 266-67, 105 S.Ct. at 1942;  Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 551.   The central purpose of the IDEA is to secure special educational entitlements to eligible recipients.  See 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400(b)(9) (\"it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of handicapped children in order to assure equal protection of the law\").  Likewise, in the present context the borrowing praxis must take into account the central importance of the IDEA's procedural overlay.

While parents and school officials dithered and debated, a disabled child with special educational needs lost day after irreplaceable day of educational opportunity mandated by law.  We cannot overlook the reality that a central federal policy underlying the IDEA, and an important feature of the IDEA-implementing scheme adopted in New Hampshire, have both been blunted.  Thus, absent a more particular limitation applicable to this extraordinary compensatory education claim, we think it appropriate to borrow the New Hampshire catch-all limitation applicable to personal actions generally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the more abbreviated the limitation on compensatory education claims the greater the disincentive to parents to shed an adversarial posture and get on with the business of cooperating with school officials to further the special-education needs of the child.  See David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460033\"><a href=\"/opinion/460033/david-d-etc-v-dartmouth-school-committee-massachusetts-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 424 (1st Cir.1985) (IDEA embodies preference for educational decisions arrived at through \"good-faith cooperation and negotiation among the parties\");  see also Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 16 (\"Obviously, the Murphys were not sitting on their rights, but were attempting to resolve their differences with the school district without resorting to litigation.\").  The resultant undermining of section 1125 would be particularly erosive of IDEA policy in New Hampshire.  Once the IEP negotiations had remained at an impasse for a reasonable period of time, i.e., not long into the two-year period during which he received no special education, the onus was on Timberlane to obtain administrative approval to implement the IEP it considered appropriate for Kevin.  See supra note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as noted above, most IDEA cases involve the borrowing of state statutes of limitations for application to judicial appeals from administrative decisions.  See Amann, 991 F.2d at 931 (collecting administrative review cases borrowing limitations ranging from thirty days to three years);   Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 548 (similar).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span> (1992), involving a compensatory education claim even roughly analogous to the Murphy claim.  The blind twenty-seven-year-old plaintiff in Hall brought an IDEA action challenging the appropriateness of the special educational services provided to her by the defendant school district between five and ten years earlier.  Id. at 404-06.   The Hall court assumed, arguendo, that a five-year limitation applied, but found the action time-barred in any event because it could not have accrued less than six years before the complaint was filed.  Id. at 408-09.   Although Hall is distinguishable from the present action on a number of grounds, the most cogent distinction is that the present dispute involves a total denial of all special education services for an extended period of time, not merely a challenge to the appropriateness of special education services provided years earlier.  Revisiting the appropriateness of special education services actually provided in school years long since passed may indeed be an exercise of \"extremely limited utility,\" as has been suggested,  see Bow, 750 F.Supp. at 550, but given the totality of the present deprivation the effort to evaluate the merits of the compensatory education claim in this case is both useful and far less problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) Accrual</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the question of accrual, which is governed by federal law.

Wegner, Educational Rights of Handicapped Children, 17 J. of L. &amp; Educ. 625, 654 (1988)).  As with the methodology for borrowing a limitation from state law, no mechanical formula controls the accrual determination:  \"Where a statute does not indicate when a cause of action accrues, the court must 'keep[ ] in mind the purpose of the [Act] and the practical ends to be served by a period of limitations.' \"  G.D., 783 F.Supp. at 1535 (alterations in original, quoting Albert v.

We need not fix the precise date of accrual, however, since the Murphys' claim unquestionably accrued within the six-year period preceding their request for administrative review on August 20, 1989.  Thus, the request for administrative review was timely whether accrual occurred in October of 1983 upon Kevin's initial trial placement at the Pinkerton school (as Timberlane urged below), or at the time he was permanently placed in January of 1984 (as the Murphys claimed), or at some intermediate time.  Moreover, from whatever point in time within the two-year period the Murphys might be found to have known (or had reason to know) either of \"the injury or the event that is the basis for their [compensatory education] claim,\" Hall, 941 F.2d at 408, Timberlane remained in continuous violation of its section 1125 obligation to pursue an administrative resolution to the IEP stalemate.  Consequently, we conclude that Timberlane's ongoing failure to comply with section 1125 throughout the relevant portion of the two-year period constituted a unitary violation under the IDEA and the New Hampshire implementing regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Shortly thereafter the Murphys filed their motion for summary judgment.  Thus, although it had clear notice that the district court would proceed to the merits, Timberlane made the strategic decision to persist with its litigation position, viz., that it could not provide evidence because its witnesses (or their memories) were unavailable.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to credit or revisit the flawed premise underlying Timberlane's Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court order disallowing defendant-appellant's defenses and affirm the judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The IDEA formerly was known as the Education of the Handicapped Act.

The James court borrowed RSA 508:4 for application to a claim for attorney fees in an IDEA action.  As the Murphys seek to enforce a substantive federal right rather than a derivative fee-shifting provision, however, the RSA 508:4 limitation is even more suitable for borrowing in the instant action on general policy grounds</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We need not address any impact that amended RSA 508:4 (three-year period), or newly enacted RSA Sec. 186-C:16-b, may have either on the present analysis or on earlier case law relating to \"borrowing\" in civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C.

Dist. v. Christopher B., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></span>, 867-88 (D.N.H.1992).  The first reported court of appeals case to recognize a compensatory education claim is Miener v. Missouri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475803\"><a href=\"/opinion/475803/terri-ann-miener-by-and-through-her-next-friend-parent-and-guardian/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 753 (8th Cir.1986).  Thus, the recency and novelty of the compensatory education remedy likewise suggest that the catch-all limitation prescribed in RSA 508:4 is most suitable for borrowing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Timberlane also argues that section 1125 is invalid because it imposes on the school district obligations beyond those authorized either by the IDEA or the New Hampshire implementing statute.  Neither argument is persuasive.  First, the IDEA and its companion regulations merely establish foundational requirements--states may impose more stringent procedural and substantive requirements.  See Burlington, 736 F.2d at 789.   Second, section 1125 is well within the broad authority conferred upon the New Hampshire Board of Education to promulgate regulations under the IDEA.  See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 186-C:16 (authorizing, inter alia, regulations governing appeals of IEP team decisions and regulations relating to \"other matters\" pertinent to implementation of the IDEA)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Timberlane's misconceptions about the IDEA are betrayed, as much as anything, by the contention that its institution of truancy proceedings should be considered the rough equivalent of the administrative adjudication required under section 1125.  Even assuming that Timberlane had done something more than merely file the truancy petition, a coercive adversarial proceeding against a parent is no substitute for a substantive review of the special educational needs of the handicapped child</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The first hurdle confronting Timberlane, of course, is that parental intransigence would not absolve the school district of its responsibility under section 1125.  Indeed, section 1125 targets intransigence.  See Murphy I, 973 F.2d at 17;   supra p. 1195.  Thus, Timberlane can demonstrate no issue of material fact in this regard.  But neither has it demonstrated a genuine issue of fact.  Although the record contains several \"sarcastic\" letters from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Sarbanis, Timberlane presented no evidence suggesting anything more than that Mr. Murphy was a tenacious and zealous advocate for his son's interests.  Summary judgment should not be disturbed on so fragile a claim, especially as two school district representatives praised Mr. Murphy as a cooperative and concerned, indeed model, parent.  Even though Mr. Sarbanis, the one school district official with whom Mr. Murphy clearly had a stormy relationship, still lives in New Hampshire, Timberlane presented no affidavit from Sarbanis.  And although Timberlane's pleadings are replete with allegations that Mr. Murphy was intransigent, \"[b]rash conjecture, coupled with the hope that something concrete will materialize, is insufficient to block summary judgment.\"  Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194847\"><a href=\"/opinion/194847/dow-v-ubc/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Given that the district court had already rejected essentially these same contentions, advanced in support of Timberlane's laches defense, see supra pp. 1189-90, the failure to comply with the Rule 56(f) affidavit requirement was no mere technical lapse.
