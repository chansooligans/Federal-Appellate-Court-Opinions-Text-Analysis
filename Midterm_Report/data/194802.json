The Board affirmed a decision and order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) awarding D'Errico benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), but also granting D'Errico's employer, General Dynamics Corporation (General Dynamics), an offset for the amounts paid to D'Errico under the terms of an earlier consent decree pursuant to a state workers' compensation law.  D'Errico challenges this offset.</span>\n</p><p>1:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">In his brief to this court, D'Errico also argued that the ALJ had erroneously awarded a credit to General Dynamics for the amount it had paid in attorney's fees under the state consent decree.  D'Errico withdrew this claim at oral argument.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">I.  Background</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">D'Errico was an employee of General Dynamics.  On July 19, 1984, he suffered injury to his right foot and back when he was struck during the course of his employment by a 2,500 pound steel \"ring\" at General Dynamics's facility at Quonset Point, Rhode Island.  The ring knocked him over, crushing his foot.  All five toes and part of the foot itself had to be amputated.  D'Errico has been unable to return to work since the accident. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';28-33-19 of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Act.  Under the decree, D'Errico received a total of $42,636, of which $12,636 was for permanent loss of use of the foot and $30,000 for permanent disfigurement.  Shortly thereafter, D'Errico filed a claim for compensation under the Act. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';903(e), to a credit or \"offset for the amounts paid to [D'Errico] under the state Consent Decree.\"  D'Errico argued unsuccessfully to the Board that General Dynamics was not entitled to this credit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">This appeal followed.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">II.  Discussion</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">\"In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\"  Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 112 S. Ct. 2589, 2594 (1992).  Section 3(e) of the Act provides in relevant part:</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';shall be credited against any liability imposed by this Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e) \"speaks with clarity,\" we are required to follow it, even if doing so produces a \"painful outcome.\"  Bouchard v. General Dynamics Corp., 963 F.2d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 1992).  The parties agree that the \"amounts paid\" to D'Errico under the consent decree were \"pursuant to [Rhode Island's] workers' compensation law.\"  Disagreement centers on whether the amounts paid were \"for the same injury, disability, or death.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e) is clear.</span>\n</p><p>2:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Prior to oral argument, the Director moved to \"amend and reform\" the caption in this appeal by \"substituting\" himself as respondent in place of the Board.  Implicit in this motion was a request to dismiss the Board as a party.  We granted this motion to the extent of naming the Director in the caption as a respondent, but denied the implicit request to dismiss the Board.  The latter request having been renewed at oral argument, we again deny it.  See Prolerized New England Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., 637 F.2d 30, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 938 (1981).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">  They argue that the award D'Errico received under the consent decree and the award he received under the Act were obviously for the \"same injury\" and that the credit to General Dynamics was therefore appropriate.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e). </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';(3)(e) lists \"injury, disability, or death\" in the disjunctive.  An employer is entitled to a credit as long as the state award is \"for the same injury, disability, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">or</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; Shipbuilding Co., 21 BRBS 314, 317 (1988) (per curiam).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e) refers, on its most natural reading, to the single physical injury D'Errico suffered on July 19, 1984.  The benefits D'Errico received under the consent decree may have been awarded to compensate him for one or more effects of, or disabilities arising from, that injury, while the benefits he received under the Act may have been awarded to compensate him for others.  Nonetheless, the physical injury upon which all of those benefits were ultimately based was the same.  In this regard, we note that the consent decree itself states that D'Errico's loss of use and disfigurement were each \"a result of [his] original injury of July 19, 1984.\"  Another \"result\" of that \"original injury\" was the permanent disability he suffered and for which he was compensated under the Act.  Since the language with which we deal here is plain, it makes no difference that the state award was denominated as an award for \"disfigurement\" and for \"loss of use,\" whereas the federal award was denominated as an award for temporary and permanent \"total disability.\"  General Dynamics is still entitled to a full credit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">We are aware that D'Errico, because he did not meet the Act's requirements, was awarded nothing under the Act for the disfigurement resulting from his injury, even though he did receive $30,000 for disfigurement under the less restrictive requirements of the state consent decree and state law.</span>\n</p><p>3:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';908(c)(20).  The ALJ found that D'Errico had \"not established entitlement to a disfigurement award under 8(c)(20) as his disfigured foot is neither a normally exposed area, nor was it shown to be a handicap to obtaining employment.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">  We are also aware that the result we reach provides D'Errico with less overall compensation for his undoubted injury than would the result D'Errico urges, and that from his perspective this is a \"painful outcome.\"  Bouchard, 963 F.2d at 544.  We believe, however, that the governing principles of statutory construction leave us no other choice.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is denied.</span>\n</p>\n\n",

The Board affirmed a decision and order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) awarding D'Errico benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), but also granting D'Errico's employer, General Dynamics Corporation (General Dynamics), an offset for the amounts paid to D'Errico under the terms of an earlier consent decree pursuant to a state workers' compensation law.

Background</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">D'Errico was an employee of General Dynamics.  On July 19, 1984, he suffered injury to his right foot and back when he was struck during the course of his employment by a 2,500 pound steel \"ring\" at General Dynamics's facility at Quonset Point, Rhode Island.  The ring knocked him over, crushing his foot.  All five toes and part of the foot itself had to be amputated.  D'Errico has been unable to return to work since the accident. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';28-33-19 of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Act.  Under the decree, D'Errico received a total of $42,636, of which $12,636 was for permanent loss of use of the foot and $30,000 for permanent disfigurement.  Shortly thereafter, D'Errico filed a claim for compensation under the Act. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';903(e), to a credit or \"offset for the amounts paid to [D'Errico] under the state Consent Decree.\"  D'Errico argued unsuccessfully to the Board that General Dynamics was not entitled to this credit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">This appeal followed.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">II.  Discussion</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">\"In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\"  Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112776\"><a href=\"/opinion/112776/estate-of-cowart-v-nicklos-drilling-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 3(e) of the Act provides in relevant part:</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';shall be credited against any liability imposed by this Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e) \"speaks with clarity,\" we are required to follow it, even if doing so produces a \"painful outcome.\"  Bouchard v. General Dynamics Corp., 963 F.2d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 1992).  The parties agree that the \"amounts paid\" to D'Errico under the consent decree were \"pursuant to [Rhode Island's] workers' compensation law.\"  Disagreement centers on whether the amounts paid were \"for the same injury, disability, or death.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e) is clear.</span>\n</p><p>2:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Prior to oral argument, the Director moved to \"amend and reform\" the caption in this appeal by \"substituting\" himself as respondent in place of the Board.  Implicit in this motion was a request to dismiss the Board as a party.  We granted this motion to the extent of naming the Director in the caption as a respondent, but denied the implicit request to dismiss the Board.  The latter request having been renewed at oral argument, we again deny it.  See Prolerized New England Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385712\"><a href=\"/opinion/385712/prolerized-new-england-company-employer-petitioner-and-hartford-accident/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></span> (1981).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">  They argue that the award D'Errico received under the consent decree and the award he received under the Act were obviously for the \"same injury\" and that the credit to General Dynamics was therefore appropriate.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';3(e). </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';(3)(e) lists \"injury, disability, or death\" in the disjunctive.

The benefits D'Errico received under the consent decree may have been awarded to compensate him for one or more effects of, or disabilities arising from, that injury, while the benefits he received under the Act may have been awarded to compensate him for others.  Nonetheless, the physical injury upon which all of those benefits were ultimately based was the same.  In this regard, we note that the consent decree itself states that D'Errico's loss of use and disfigurement were each \"a result of [his] original injury of July 19, 1984.\"  Another \"result\" of that \"original injury\" was the permanent disability he suffered and for which he was compensated under the Act.  Since the language with which we deal here is plain, it makes no difference that the state award was denominated as an award for \"disfigurement\" and for \"loss of use,\" whereas the federal award was denominated as an award for temporary and permanent \"total disability.\"  General Dynamics is still entitled to a full credit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">We are aware that D'Errico, because he did not meet the Act's requirements, was awarded nothing under the Act for the disfigurement resulting from his injury, even though he did receive $30,000 for disfigurement under the less restrictive requirements of the state consent decree and state law.</span>\n</p><p>3:</p><p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';908(c)(20).  The ALJ found that D'Errico had \"not established entitlement to a disfigurement award under 8(c)(20) as his disfigured foot is neither a normally exposed area, nor was it shown to be a handicap to obtaining employment.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">  We are also aware that the result we reach provides D'Errico with less overall compensation for his undoubted injury than would the result D'Errico urges, and that from his perspective this is a \"painful outcome.\"  Bouchard, 963 F.2d at 544.  We believe, however, that the governing principles of statutory construction leave us no other choice.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;text-indent:1.2500inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is denied.</span>\n</p>\n\n",
