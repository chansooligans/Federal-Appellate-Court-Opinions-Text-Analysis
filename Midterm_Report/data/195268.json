First, he  asserts certain factual \"inaccuracies\" in\n\nthe  presentence report  [PSR].   Second, he claims  that the\n\ndistrict court  erred in accepting the  recommendation of the\n\nPSR and denying him  a two level reduction for  acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.  Finally,  he notes that the  PSR states that\n\nhe was  convicted of  conspiracy  to possess  with intent  to\n\ndistribute  more  than  500  grams of  cocaine,  whereas  the\n\njudgment  lists  the offense  as  possession  with intent  to\n\ndistribute more than 500 grams of cocaine.\n\n     Neither  of  the first  two  asserted  claims alleges  a\n\nconstitutional  or a  jurisdictional error.   Since Martinez-\n\nMejia failed to  pursue either  claim on  direct appeal,  any\n\nerror   would   warrant   reversal   only   in   \"exceptional\n\ncircumstances\" and only if the  error resulted in a \"complete\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\"   Knight v.
