This appeal arises out of  a\n                                  \n\nsummary  judgment  granted  on  behalf  of  Polaroid  Corporation\n\n(\"Polaroid\") dismissing a breach of contract action brought  by a\n\nformer employee, Donato F. Pizzuti (\"Pizzuti\").1  We affirm.\n\n          The crux of the  lawsuit concerns the interpretation of\n\nPolaroid's Profit Sharing Retirement Plan (the \"Retirement Plan\")\n\nas well  as that  company's Employee Incentive  Compensation Plan\n\n(the  \"Bonus Plan\")  with  respect to  Pizzuti's contention  that\n\nPolaroid's employer  contributions from  April, 1976  to January,\n\n1986 were undersubscribed.  Pizzuti based this contention on  the\n\nwinning and eventual settlement of  a patent infringement suit by\n\nPolaroid against  Eastman Kodak  Co. (\"Kodak\") pursuant  to which\n\nKodak  paid approximately  $925  million in  cash and  short-term\n\nsecurities  to  Polaroid  for infringements  occurring  from 1976\n\nthrough 1986.  Pizzuti  contends that those payments require  the\n\nrestatement of Polaroid's profits for those years and in turn the\n\npayment  of the additional  benefits and bonuses  that would have\n\nbeen received from these additional receipts.\n\n          Although  Pizzuti objects  to  the granting  of summary\n\njudgment,  we  believe otherwise.   This  is  a classic  case for\n\nsummary  judgment:    no  material  facts  are  in   dispute  and\n\ndisposition is dependent  only on the legal interpretation of the\n\nRetirement  and   Bonus Plans.   See  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 56.   The\n                                    \n\nstandard of review of  the district court's decision is  de novo,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n1    Although  originally  brought  as  a  class  action  in  the\nMassachusetts  Superior Court,  it  was never  certified as  such\neither by the  state court or by the district  court after it was\nremoved to the federal court.\n\nas only issues of  law are involved.

In construing\n                     \n\nERISA-governed plans,  we apply \"common-sense canons  of contract\n\ninterpretation.\"   Wickman  v. Northwestern  Nat'l Ins.  Co., 908\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1077, 1084 (1st Cir.) (quoting Burnham v.

Although the Bonus Plan is governed by Massachusetts\n\nlaw,  the standard  of interpretation  is similar,  requiring the\n\ncourt  to  give  nonambiguous  terms  their  usual  and  ordinary\n\nmeaning.   Ober v. National  Casualty Co., 318  Mass. 27, 30,  60\n                                         \n\nN.E.2d 90, 91 (1945).\n\n          A reading of the  Plan leads us to the  same conclusion\n\nreached by the  district court:   \"[n]othing in  the language  of\n\neither plan requires Polaroid to revisit a  previously-determined\n\nnet profit and recalculate that figure based upon gains or losses\n\nresulting  from subsequent  litigation,  or  any  other  source.\"\n\nPizzuti  v. Polaroid  Corp., No.  91-13018-H, slip  op. at  2 (D.\n                           \n\nMass.  July  9,  1992).    Section 3.01  of the  Retirement  Plan\n\nprovides:\n\n            [T]he term \"net profit\" for any Plan Year\n            shall  mean the  total on  a consolidated\n            basis  of the  net earnings  of [Polaroid\n            and  its  subsidiaries]  for   such  year\n\n                               -3-\n\n            (excluding gains from the  sale, exchange\n            or  other  disposition   of  capital   or\n            depreciable  assets  not in  the ordinary\n            course  of  business),  as   computed  by\n            [Polaroid's]  accountants  in  accordance\n                                                     \n            with standard accounting practices .  . .\n                                              \n            [Polaroid's]  determination  of such  net\n            profits  shall  be  conclusive   for  all\n                                                     \n            purposes under the Plan.\n                                   \n\n(Emphasis added.).\n\n          The  undisputed  evidence  demonstrates  that  standard\n\naccounting   practices  require  that   litigation  judgments  or\n\nsettlements  may  only  be  recognized  as  income  in  the  year\n\nreceived.   This fact is reinforced by  Polaroid's recognition of\n\nthe  entire  $925  million  settlement  amount  as  1991  income,\n\nnotwithstanding  that Polaroid  undoubtedly would  have benefited\n\nunder  the  tax code  had it  been  allowed to  redistribute this\n\nsettlement as proposed by Pizzuti.\n\n          Section  3.01  of  the  Bonus Plan  also  provides  for\n\ncalculation of \"net profits\" on an annual basis \"by the Company's\n\naccountants  in accordance  with standard  accounting practices,\"\n\nand also states  that \"[t]he Company's determination  of such net\n\nprofit shall be conclusive for all purposes under the Plan.\"\n\n          There is nothing ambiguous in the indicated language of\n\nthe Plans.   See ITT Corp.  v. LTX Corp., supra  at 1261 (whether\n                                               \n\ncontract term is ambiguous is question of law for the court).  It\n\nrequires  that net profits be determined annually, on the year in\n\nwhich   the  income   is   received,  and   that  the   Company's\n\ndetermination in this  respect is decisive  and final as  regards\n\nthe Plans.  There is nothing more to be said.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Polaroid  Corp., No.  91-13018-H, slip  op. at  2 (D.\n                           \n\nMass.  July  9,  1992).    Section 3.01  of the  Retirement  Plan\n\nprovides:\n\n            [T]he term \"net profit\" for any Plan Year\n            shall  mean the  total on  a consolidated\n            basis  of the  net earnings  of [Polaroid\n            and  its  subsidiaries]  for   such  year\n\n                               -3-\n\n            (excluding gains from the  sale, exchange\n            or  other  disposition   of  capital   or\n            depreciable  assets  not in  the ordinary\n            course  of  business),  as   computed  by\n            [Polaroid's]  accountants  in  accordance\n                                                     \n            with standard accounting practices .  . .\n                                              \n            [Polaroid's]  determination  of such  net\n            profits  shall  be  conclusive   for  all\n                                                     \n            purposes under the Plan.\n                                   \n\n(Emphasis added.).\n\n          The  undisputed  evidence  demonstrates  that  standard\n\naccounting   practices  require  that   litigation  judgments  or\n\nsettlements  may  only  be  recognized  as  income  in  the  year\n\nreceived.   This fact is reinforced by  Polaroid's recognition of\n\nthe  entire  $925  million  settlement  amount  as  1991  income,\n\nnotwithstanding  that Polaroid  undoubtedly would  have benefited\n\nunder  the  tax code  had it  been  allowed to  redistribute this\n\nsettlement as proposed by Pizzuti.\n\n          Section  3.01  of  the  Bonus Plan  also  provides  for\n\ncalculation of \"net profits\" on an annual basis \"by the Company's\n\naccountants  in accordance  with standard  accounting practices,\"\n\nand also states  that \"[t]he Company's determination  of such net\n\nprofit shall be conclusive for all purposes under the Plan.\"\n\n          There is nothing ambiguous in the indicated language of\n\nthe Plans.   See ITT Corp.  v. LTX Corp., supra  at 1261 (whether\n                                               \n\ncontract term is ambiguous is question of law for the court).  It\n\nrequires  that net profits be determined annually, on the year in\n\nwhich   the  income   is   received,  and   that  the   Company's\n\ndetermination in this  respect is decisive  and final as  regards\n\nthe Plans.  There is nothing more to be said.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.   Costs\n                                                        \n\nto appellee.\n\n                               -5-\n</pre>",
