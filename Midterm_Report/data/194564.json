Plaintiff Berenice  Gorczakoski appeals pro\n                                                             \n\nse from a district court judgment dismissing her complaint as\n  \n\nfrivolous  under  28  U.S.C.    1915(d).    Having  carefully\n\nreviewed the record and the parties' briefs, we conclude that\n\n\"no  substantial question  is  presented\"  and  that  summary\n\naffirmance is therefore warranted under Loc. R. 27.1. \n\n     Plaintiff's suit involves a dispute over an inheritance.\n\nHer complaint alleges that,  upon the death of her  mother in\n\nMay 1991, plaintiff inherited  a fifty percent interest in  a\n\nhouse  and property  located  in North  Adams, Massachusetts.\n\nAlthough her mother's will specified that all real estate was\n\nto \"be  sold as soon  as practicable,\" plaintiff  expressed a\n\ndesire to acquire full  ownership of the house by  buying out\n\nthe interests of  her sisters (the other  beneficiaries).  In\n\nDecember  1991, at the behest of  the executrix, the attorney\n\nrepresenting the estate obtained a restraining order from the\n\nPittsfield Probate  and Family Court  which barred  plaintiff\n\nfrom  entering  the  house and  directed  that  the  house be\n\npadlocked.   Plaintiff  filed  the instant  suit against  the\n\nattorney (and  his partners), complaining both  of her ouster\n\nfrom the property and of the ongoing plans to sell the house.\n\nCharging   that  defendants  had  operated  deceitfully,  she\n\nrequested that the property be  returned to her, that various\n\nrepairs be performed, and that damages be awarded.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     After  granting plaintiff's  application  for  in  forma\n                                                             \n\npauperis  (IFP)  status,  the  district  court construed  her\n        \n\ncomplaint  as  one   under  42  U.S.C.      1983  alleging  a\n\ndeprivation of property without due process.  The court  then\n\nreviewed  the  complaint under  28  U.S.C.    1915(d),  which\n\npermits the dismissal of IFP complaints that are \"frivolous.\"\n\nA complaint  is frivolous  when it  \"lacks an arguable  basis\n\neither  in  law  or fact\"--i.e.,  when  it  is  \"based on  an\n\nindisputably  meritless  legal   theory\"  or  makes  \"clearly\n\nbaseless\" factual allegations.  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n319, 325, 327 (1989).  The district court determined that the\n\ncomplaint, even  when liberally  construed, suffered in  this\n\nregard  as to each of the two  essential elements of a   1983\n\nclaim:  (1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a\n\nperson under  color of state law, and  (2) that it deprived a\n\nperson of  rights, privileges,  or immunities secured  by the\n\nConstitution or federal law.   See, e.g., Parratt v.  Taylor,\n                                                            \n\n451  U.S.   527,  535  (1981).    The  case  was  accordingly\n\ndismissed.\n\n     We   find  no  abuse  of  discretion.    See  Denton  v.\n                                                         \n\nHernandez,  112  S.  Ct.  1728,  1734  (1992)  (\"Because  the\n         \n\nfrivolousness determination  is a discretionary one,  ... a  \n\n1915(d) dismissal  is properly reviewed  for an abuse  of ...\n\ndiscretion.\").  We need  not examine whether defendants might\n\nproperly be deemed state actors for purposes of   1983, as it\n\n                             -3-\n\nis clear that plaintiff has failed to allege even an arguable\n\ndue  process  violation.   Nowhere  below  or  on appeal  has\n\nplaintiff adverted to any procedural irregularity surrounding\n\nthe  events in question.  In particular, she does not suggest\n\n(1)  that  the  procedures  attending  the  issuance  of  the\n\nrestraining order  were in any  way deficient,  (2) that  the\n\nattorney somehow exceeded the scope of that order in removing\n\nher from the house and padlocking it, or (3) that his pursuit\n\nof plans to sell the house was contrary  to the directives of\n\nthe  court  or  the  executrix.   Rather,  her  complaint  is\n\ndirected  solely at the substance of decisions reached by the\n\ncourt and the executrix--decisions  which are routinely  made\n\nin the course of probate proceedings.  Any disagreement  with\n\nthose decisions must be pursued through the state courts.  \n\n     Plaintiff  has  alleged no  facts  which  even begin  to\n\napproach a  constitutional violation.   See Watson  v. Caton,\n                                                            \n\n    F.2d    , No. 92-1269, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir. 1993) (per\n\ncuriam) (\"The difference between failing to state a claim and\n\nmaking  a frivolous claim is in some situations a question of\n\ndegree.\").  As no substantial question has been presented, we\n\nsummarily affirm the dismissal of her complaint under Loc. R.\n\n27.1.  We  note that  such dismissal does  not bar  plaintiff\n\nfrom  repleading  her claim  by  means  of a  paid  complaint\n\n(which, according to her financial affidavit, she may well be\n\ncapable of affording).  See Denton, 112 S. Ct. at 1734.\n                                  \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Affirmed.  The motion to dismiss is denied as moot.\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n",
