Vincent M.  Portalla, also\n                              \n\nknown  as Vincent  Marino, appeals  from  a decision  of the\n\nfederal  district court  revoking  his  term of  \"supervised\n\nrelease,\" (related to a  previous conviction for illegal gun\n\npossession)  and ordering  him to  return to  prison for  an\n\nadditional  two years.   See  18 U.S.C.    3583;  U.S.S.G.  \n                            \n\n7B1.3-1.4,  p.s.    The  court  revoked  Marino's supervised\n\nrelease  because  it  found  that Marino  had  violated  two\n\nimportant supervised release \"conditions\": (1) the condition\n\nthat he not  commit further  crimes; and  (2) the  condition\n\nthat he not  associate with other convicted felons.   Marino\n\nclaims  that  the  district  court's factual  findings  lack\n\nadequate support in the record.  \n\n          The  parties   agree,  as  they   must,  that   in\n\nrevocation proceedings  (1) the court  must find facts  by a\n\n\"preponderance of the evidence,\" 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3); (2)\n\nthe evidence need not satisfy the tests of admissibility set\n\nforth  in the Federal Rules of Evidence, which do not apply,\n\nsee U.S.S.G.    6A1.3; Fed.  R. Evid. 1101  (d)(3); but  (3)\n   \n\nevidence that does not  satisfy those Rules must nonetheless\n\nbe reliable.  See  U.S.S.G.   6A1.3; United States  v. Geer,\n                                                           \n\n923 F.2d  892, 897 (1st Cir. 1991).  Moreover, on appeal, we\n\nconsider the  evidence in  the light  most favorable  to the\n\ngovernment, see United States v. Manning,  955 F.2d 770, 773\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), and we recognize the district court's broad\n\nlegal  power to  determine witness  credibility, see  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Resurreccion, 978 F.2d 759, 761  (1st Cir. 1992).\n                       \n\nApplying these standards to the  record before us, we cannot\n\naccept appellant's arguments.\n\n          First, the  district court found  that, on January\n\n30, 1992,  Marino, with two other  men, unlawfully conspired\n\nto  sell  cocaine  to  undercover  Boston  police  officers.\n\nMarino, in effect, concedes for purposes of this appeal that\n\non January 30, 1992, Boston  Police Detective Charles Wilson\n\ncalled a  phone number (257-6673)  and said \"Batman,  I need\n\none.\"  Marino also effectively concedes that, as a result of\n                                                            \n\nthis  call, two men, Michael Oboardi (whom Marino knew to be\n          \n\na  felon) and Dennis Othmer,  appeared at a  parking lot and\n\ngave waiting Boston police  officers cocaine in exchange for\n\ncash.  Marino  denies, however,  that he was  \"Batman.\"   He\n\nsays that the evidence  is not sufficient to show  that when\n\nWilson  called 257-6673, it was he, Marino, at the other end\n                                  \n\nof the line.\n\n          The evidence on which the court relied in reaching\n\nthe determination that Marino  was the person called amounts\n\nto the following:\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          (1)  Detective Wilson testified that he recognized\n          Marino's voice.   Wilson had not  spoken to Marino\n          for two years, but he previously had spoken to him\n          frequently (thirty  to  forty times  over  six  to\n          seven years).\n\n          (2) About  ten days later Wilson  again called the\n          same number.  He addressed the person who answered\n          as \"Gigi.\"   Wilson  testified that the  person on\n          the  other  end of  the  line  continued a  normal\n          conversation,  apparently   accepting  the  \"Gigi\"\n          designation.  \"Gigi\" is Marino's nickname.  Wilson\n          added that he again recognized Marino's voice.\n\n          (3)  Marino's \"sister-in-law\" (i.e.  the sister of\n          the  women  with whom  Marino  lives,  who is  the\n          mother of  his child)  rented a Motorola  cellular\n          telephone with  the  critical phone  number  (257-\n          6673).\n\n          (4)  When  police  officers  arrested  Marino they\n          found  in his  possession the same  model Motorola\n          cellular phone that  Marino's \"sister-in-law\"  had\n          rented  (though its  serial number  had apparently\n          been removed). \n\n          Marino argues  that key portions  of the evidence,\n\nnamely  the phone  conversations, involve hearsay;  that (in\n\nlight of a  history of police  harassment) we must  consider\n\nthe \"hearsay\" unreliable; and that, without the hearsay, the\n\nevidence is inadequate.   Marino is wrong about calling  the\n\nevidence \"hearsay,\"  for the statements spoken  at the other\n\nend of the  phone were not admitted for their  truth, but to\n\nprove  that Marino  was  the speaker.    See Fed.  R.  Evid.\n                                            \n\n801(c).  We  cannot say the  district court committed  legal\n\nerror in crediting Detective Wilson's  testimony identifying\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nMarino's voice.  See United States  v. Geer, 923 F.2d at 897\n                                           \n\n(\"[T]he sentencing judge has  broad discretion to decide for\n\nhimself not only the relevance,  but also the reliability of\n\nthe  sentencing  information.\"  (citation  omitted)).    The\n\nevidence, we  agree, might  well have  been stronger.   But,\n\ngiven   Wilson's  long   acquaintance  with   Marino,  voice\n\nrecognition was  not impossible.   That recognition together\n\nwith (1)  the  nickname,  (2)  the  \"sister-in-law's\"  phone\n\nrental, and  (3) Marino's possession  of a similar  phone in\n\nour view is  sufficient to  meet the  \"preponderance of  the\n\nevidence\" standard.  Cf., United States v. Angiulo, 847 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n956,  967  (1st  Cir.)  (holding that  voice  identification\n\ntogether  with  circumstantial evidence  was  sufficient for\n\njury   to   conclude   that   defendant    participated   in\n\nconversation), cert.  denied, 488 U.S.  928 (1988).   As  we\n                            \n\nhave said, Marino does not deny that the person at the other\n\nend  of the line  (\"Batman\") facilitated the  drug sale, nor\n\ndoes  he deny  that one  of the  persons with  whom \"Batman\"\n\n\"associated\" in committing his crime (Michael Oboardi) was a\n\nfelon.   The  record  thus contains  sufficient evidence  to\n\nsupport  the  district  court's  finding  that  Marino   had\n\nparticipated in  the drug  conspiracy and associated  with a\n\nknown felon.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          Second, the district  court found that  Marino had\n\ncommitted another  crime on February 5,  1992, by assaulting\n\nDennis Caldarelli with a gun.  The evidence before the court\n\nconsisted primarily of the following:\n\n          (1) State Trooper  Thomas Flaherty testified  that\n          at about 3:30 a.m. on that day, Caldarelli arrived\n          at  Flaherty's cruiser,  parked at  a construction\n          site at the Callahan Tunnel.  Caldarelli was upset\n          and  had  a  bruise  on  the  side  of  his  face.\n          According  to Flaherty,  Caldarelli told  him that\n          Marino  (in a  car  with another  man) had  chased\n          Caldarelli's car  and forced it off  the road (the\n          curb blowing  out two  of its tires).   Caldarelli\n          also stated that Marino had asked  him to get into\n          Marino's vehicle;  that, once inside  the vehicle,\n          Marino had accused him of providing information to\n          the police regarding  the shooting of  Salemme and\n          had struck  him several times  on the side  of the\n          head with a pistol; and that, while Caldarelli was\n          running  away, Marino had  fired several  shots at\n          him.\n\n          (2) The record of Marino's original conviction for\n          gun  possession in  1989 (upon which  the district\n          court  relied)  showed  that  Marino  had  been  a\n          suspect in the shooting of Salemme.\n\n          (3) State Trooper Stephen McDonald  testified that\n          Caldarelli  had actually  made  two visits  to the\n                                             \n          Callahan tunnel  construction site on  the morning\n          in question (the  first after he had  been run off\n          the road and the second  after the pistol-whipping\n          incident).  \n\n               First,  at  about 2:15  a.m.,  Caldarelli had\n          driven  up to  McDonald's  cruiser with  two  flat\n          tires, which  Caldarelli said  were caused  by his\n          having  driven  over  a  traffic  island.    After\n          speaking  to McDonald,  Caldarelli  drove the  car\n          into  the North End to park it, until he could fix\n          the tires.  \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n               Second,  Caldarelli returned to the tunnel on\n          foot  and spoke  with Trooper  Flaherty. (McDonald\n          testified that he saw this occur about five to ten\n          minutes after Caldarelli drove into the North End,\n          though  Flaherty  testified  that it  happened  at\n          about 3:30  a.m.)  According  to Trooper McDonald,\n          on Caldarelli's second  visit to the  construction\n          site, in addition to  telling his story to Trooper\n          Flaherty, Caldarelli explained to Trooper McDonald\n          that  his  initial  tire  blow  out  had  occurred\n          because he  had been trying to  escape Marino, who\n          had  been  shooting  at  his car.    When  Trooper\n          McDonald asked Caldarelli why  he had not told him\n          about the  shooting when they first  spoke (before\n          the alleged pistol  whipping incident)  Caldarelli\n          replied that he  had been too  scared to tell  the\n          truth.\n\n          (4) Trooper McDonald placed a call on his radio to\n          the Boston Police.  Boston Police Officers  Donald\n          Lee and  Christopher Boyle responded to  the call.\n          Lee testified that  when they arrived,  Caldarelli\n          described  to  them both  Marino's having  shot at\n          Caldarelli's  car  (forcing  him  over  a  traffic\n          island) and Marino's  later having  pistol-whipped\n          him, accused him of being \"with Salemme,\" and shot\n          at him  again as  he was  fleeing.   Officer Boyle\n          offered  substantially  similar  testimony.   They\n          both  noticed   a  red  bruise  on   the  side  of\n          Caldarelli's head.\n\n          Marino  points out that  at the revocation hearing\n\nCaldarelli  essentially denied  these  events.    Caldarelli\n\nconceded that the  side of  his head was  bruised, but  said\n\nthat  an unknown  person had  \"sucker-punched\" him.   Marino\n\nadds that the hearsay evidence to the contrary (Caldarelli's\n\nstatements to the State Troopers and Boston Police Officers)\n\nwas  not  sufficiently  reliable  to   warrant  the  court's\n\nfindings.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          We  agree  with  Marino  that  the  statements  of\n\nCaldarelli  to State  Troopers  Flaherty  and  McDonald  and\n\nBoston  Police Officers  Lee and  Boyle are  hearsay, though\n\nthey might well be  admissible in ordinary court proceedings\n\nas  \"excited  utterances.\"     See  Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(2).\n                                  \n\nRegardless,  there are  considerable indicia  of reliability\n\nsupporting the  officers' statements, such  as their detail,\n\nthe undenied bruises, and  the flat tires.  Also,  there are\n\nplausible reasons  for Caldarelli's  later change of  heart,\n\nnamely the  fear that  Marino might retaliate  if Caldarelli\n\ntestified  against him (just  as Marino was  alleged to have\n\ndone regarding the  Salemme shooting).    Marino, in effect,\n\nsays  that the  officers made up  this story  as part  of an\n\neffort to harass him.  But, the record does not warrant such\n\na conclusion  -- indeed  it suggests that  Troopers Flaherty\n\nand McDonald knew  neither Marino nor Officers Boyle and Lee\n\n-- and there  is nothing  here that would  warrant a  highly\n\nunusual  appellate court  disregard  of  a district  court's\n\ncredibility determination.\n\n          Finally, Marino  argues  that the  district  court\n\nshould not  have admitted  the record  related to  his prior\n\nconviction.  He says that  to do so is to admit  a \"past bad\n\nact\"  and, therefore,  to violate  normal  evidentiary rules\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthat  keep such  matters out  of criminal  trials.   Fed. R.\n\nEvid.  404(b).  The  Federal Rules of  Evidence, however, do\n\nnot apply in this case.  See U.S.S.G.   6A1.3; Fed. R. Evid.\n                            \n\n1101(d)(3).   And, in any event, the  principles they embody\n\nmake such evidence  inadmissible only when its  object is to\n\nshow a propensity to commit crimes or, essentially,  to help\n\na fact  finder  reason \"he  did it  before, so  he'll do  it\n\nagain.\"    See  Fed.  R. Evid.  404(b)  (\"Evidence  of other\n              \n\ncrimes,  wrongs, or  acts  is not  admissible  to prove  the\n\ncharacter  of  a  person  in  order  to  suggest  action  in\n\nconformity  therewith.\").    Such  evidence  is  admissible,\n\nhowever, for \"other purposes,\"  such as to show, as  here, a\n\ndefendant's  \"motive\"  for  a   crime,  id.;  or  why  other\n                                           \n\nwitnesses (here  the victim)  might be  lying at  trial, cf.\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v.

Vincent M.  Portalla, also\n                              \n\nknown  as Vincent  Marino, appeals  from  a decision  of the\n\nfederal  district court  revoking  his  term of  \"supervised\n\nrelease,\" (related to a  previous conviction for illegal gun\n\npossession)  and ordering  him to  return to  prison for  an\n\nadditional  two years.   See  18 U.S.C.    3583;  U.S.S.G.  \n                            \n\n7B1.3-1.4,  p.s.    The  court  revoked  Marino's supervised\n\nrelease  because  it  found  that Marino  had  violated  two\n\nimportant supervised release \"conditions\": (1) the condition\n\nthat he not  commit further  crimes; and  (2) the  condition\n\nthat he not  associate with other convicted felons.   Marino\n\nclaims  that  the  district  court's factual  findings  lack\n\nadequate support in the record.  \n\n          The  parties   agree,  as  they   must,  that   in\n\nrevocation proceedings  (1) the court  must find facts  by a\n\n\"preponderance of the evidence,\" 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3); (2)\n\nthe evidence need not satisfy the tests of admissibility set\n\nforth  in the Federal Rules of Evidence, which do not apply,\n\nsee U.S.S.G.    6A1.3; Fed.  R. Evid. 1101  (d)(3); but  (3)\n   \n\nevidence that does not  satisfy those Rules must nonetheless\n\nbe reliable.  See  U.S.S.G.   6A1.3; United States  v.

Marino  denies, however,  that he was  \"Batman.\"   He\n\nsays that the evidence  is not sufficient to show  that when\n\nWilson  called 257-6673, it was he, Marino, at the other end\n                                  \n\nof the line.\n\n          The evidence on which the court relied in reaching\n\nthe determination that Marino  was the person called amounts\n\nto the following:\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          (1)  Detective Wilson testified that he recognized\n          Marino's voice.   Wilson had not  spoken to Marino\n          for two years, but he previously had spoken to him\n          frequently (thirty  to  forty times  over  six  to\n          seven years).\n\n          (2) About  ten days later Wilson  again called the\n          same number.  He addressed the person who answered\n          as \"Gigi.\"   Wilson  testified that the  person on\n          the  other  end of  the  line  continued a  normal\n          conversation,  apparently   accepting  the  \"Gigi\"\n          designation.  \"Gigi\" is Marino's nickname.  Wilson\n          added that he again recognized Marino's voice.\n\n          (3)  Marino's \"sister-in-law\" (i.e.  the sister of\n          the  women  with whom  Marino  lives,  who is  the\n          mother of  his child)  rented a Motorola  cellular\n          telephone with  the  critical phone  number  (257-\n          6673).\n\n          (4)  When  police  officers  arrested  Marino they\n          found  in his  possession the same  model Motorola\n          cellular phone that  Marino's \"sister-in-law\"  had\n          rented  (though its  serial number  had apparently\n          been removed). \n\n          Marino argues  that key portions  of the evidence,\n\nnamely  the phone  conversations, involve hearsay;  that (in\n\nlight of a  history of police  harassment) we must  consider\n\nthe \"hearsay\" unreliable; and that, without the hearsay, the\n\nevidence is inadequate.   Marino is wrong about calling  the\n\nevidence \"hearsay,\"  for the statements spoken  at the other\n\nend of the  phone were not admitted for their  truth, but to\n\nprove  that Marino  was  the speaker.    See Fed.  R.  Evid.\n                                            \n\n801(c).  We  cannot say the  district court committed  legal\n\nerror in crediting Detective Wilson's  testimony identifying\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nMarino's voice.  See United States  v. Geer, 923 F.2d at 897\n                                           \n\n(\"[T]he sentencing judge has  broad discretion to decide for\n\nhimself not only the relevance,  but also the reliability of\n\nthe  sentencing  information.\"  (citation  omitted)).    The\n\nevidence, we  agree, might  well have  been stronger.   But,\n\ngiven   Wilson's  long   acquaintance  with   Marino,  voice\n\nrecognition was  not impossible.   That recognition together\n\nwith (1)  the  nickname,  (2)  the  \"sister-in-law's\"  phone\n\nrental, and  (3) Marino's possession  of a similar  phone in\n\nour view is  sufficient to  meet the  \"preponderance of  the\n\nevidence\" standard.

Angiulo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506589\"><a href=\"/opinion/506589/united-states-v-jason-brion-angiulo-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                  \n\n<span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  967  (1st  Cir.)  (holding that  voice  identification\n\ntogether  with  circumstantial evidence  was  sufficient for\n\njury   to   conclude   that   defendant    participated   in\n\nconversation), cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).   As  we\n                            \n\nhave said, Marino does not deny that the person at the other\n\nend  of the line  (\"Batman\") facilitated the  drug sale, nor\n\ndoes  he deny  that one  of the  persons with  whom \"Batman\"\n\n\"associated\" in committing his crime (Michael Oboardi) was a\n\nfelon.   The  record  thus contains  sufficient evidence  to\n\nsupport  the  district  court's  finding  that  Marino   had\n\nparticipated in  the drug  conspiracy and associated  with a\n\nknown felon.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          Second, the district  court found that  Marino had\n\ncommitted another  crime on February 5,  1992, by assaulting\n\nDennis Caldarelli with a gun.  The evidence before the court\n\nconsisted primarily of the following:\n\n          (1) State Trooper  Thomas Flaherty testified  that\n          at about 3:30 a.m. on that day, Caldarelli arrived\n          at  Flaherty's cruiser,  parked at  a construction\n          site at the Callahan Tunnel.  Caldarelli was upset\n          and  had  a  bruise  on  the  side  of  his  face.\n          According  to Flaherty,  Caldarelli told  him that\n          Marino  (in a  car  with another  man) had  chased\n          Caldarelli's car  and forced it off  the road (the\n          curb blowing  out two  of its tires).   Caldarelli\n          also stated that Marino had asked  him to get into\n          Marino's vehicle;  that, once inside  the vehicle,\n          Marino had accused him of providing information to\n          the police regarding  the shooting of  Salemme and\n          had struck  him several times  on the side  of the\n          head with a pistol; and that, while Caldarelli was\n          running  away, Marino had  fired several  shots at\n          him.\n\n          (2) The record of Marino's original conviction for\n          gun  possession in  1989 (upon which  the district\n          court  relied)  showed  that  Marino  had  been  a\n          suspect in the shooting of Salemme.\n\n          (3) State Trooper Stephen McDonald  testified that\n          Caldarelli  had actually  made  two visits  to the\n                                             \n          Callahan tunnel  construction site on  the morning\n          in question (the  first after he had  been run off\n          the road and the second  after the pistol-whipping\n          incident).  \n\n               First,  at  about 2:15  a.m.,  Caldarelli had\n          driven  up to  McDonald's  cruiser with  two  flat\n          tires, which  Caldarelli said  were caused  by his\n          having  driven  over  a  traffic  island.    After\n          speaking  to McDonald,  Caldarelli  drove the  car\n          into  the North End to park it, until he could fix\n          the tires.  \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n               Second,  Caldarelli returned to the tunnel on\n          foot  and spoke  with Trooper  Flaherty. (McDonald\n          testified that he saw this occur about five to ten\n          minutes after Caldarelli drove into the North End,\n          though  Flaherty  testified  that it  happened  at\n          about 3:30  a.m.)  According  to Trooper McDonald,\n          on Caldarelli's second  visit to the  construction\n          site, in addition to  telling his story to Trooper\n          Flaherty, Caldarelli explained to Trooper McDonald\n          that  his  initial  tire  blow  out  had  occurred\n          because he  had been trying to  escape Marino, who\n          had  been  shooting  at  his car.    When  Trooper\n          McDonald asked Caldarelli why  he had not told him\n          about the  shooting when they first  spoke (before\n          the alleged pistol  whipping incident)  Caldarelli\n          replied that he  had been too  scared to tell  the\n          truth.\n\n          (4) Trooper McDonald placed a call on his radio to\n          the Boston Police.  Boston Police Officers  Donald\n          Lee and  Christopher Boyle responded to  the call.\n          Lee testified that  when they arrived,  Caldarelli\n          described  to  them both  Marino's having  shot at\n          Caldarelli's  car  (forcing  him  over  a  traffic\n          island) and Marino's  later having  pistol-whipped\n          him, accused him of being \"with Salemme,\" and shot\n          at him  again as  he was  fleeing.   Officer Boyle\n          offered  substantially  similar  testimony.   They\n          both  noticed   a  red  bruise  on   the  side  of\n          Caldarelli's head.\n\n          Marino  points out that  at the revocation hearing\n\nCaldarelli  essentially denied  these  events.    Caldarelli\n\nconceded that the  side of  his head was  bruised, but  said\n\nthat  an unknown  person had  \"sucker-punched\" him.   Marino\n\nadds that the hearsay evidence to the contrary (Caldarelli's\n\nstatements to the State Troopers and Boston Police Officers)\n\nwas  not  sufficiently  reliable  to   warrant  the  court's\n\nfindings.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          We  agree  with  Marino  that  the  statements  of\n\nCaldarelli  to State  Troopers  Flaherty  and  McDonald  and\n\nBoston  Police Officers  Lee and  Boyle are  hearsay, though\n\nthey might well be  admissible in ordinary court proceedings\n\nas  \"excited  utterances.\"     See  Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(2).\n                                  \n\nRegardless,  there are  considerable indicia  of reliability\n\nsupporting the  officers' statements, such  as their detail,\n\nthe undenied bruises, and  the flat tires.  Also,  there are\n\nplausible reasons  for Caldarelli's  later change of  heart,\n\nnamely the  fear that  Marino might retaliate  if Caldarelli\n\ntestified  against him (just  as Marino was  alleged to have\n\ndone regarding the  Salemme shooting).    Marino, in effect,\n\nsays  that the  officers made up  this story  as part  of an\n\neffort to harass him.  But, the record does not warrant such\n\na conclusion  -- indeed  it suggests that  Troopers Flaherty\n\nand McDonald knew  neither Marino nor Officers Boyle and Lee\n\n-- and there  is nothing  here that would  warrant a  highly\n\nunusual  appellate court  disregard  of  a district  court's\n\ncredibility determination.\n\n          Finally, Marino  argues  that the  district  court\n\nshould not  have admitted  the record  related to  his prior\n\nconviction.  He says that  to do so is to admit  a \"past bad\n\nact\"  and, therefore,  to violate  normal  evidentiary rules\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthat  keep such  matters out  of criminal  trials.

And, in any event, the  principles they embody\n\nmake such evidence  inadmissible only when its  object is to\n\nshow a propensity to commit crimes or, essentially,  to help\n\na fact  finder  reason \"he  did it  before, so  he'll do  it\n\nagain.\"    See  Fed.

Evid.  404(b)  (\"Evidence  of other\n              \n\ncrimes,  wrongs, or  acts  is not  admissible  to prove  the\n\ncharacter  of  a  person  in  order  to  suggest  action  in\n\nconformity  therewith.\").
