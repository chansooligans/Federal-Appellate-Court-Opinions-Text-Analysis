We approach once more the lair of\n          SELYA Circuit Judge.\n                             \n\nthe fabled \"litigatory  monster,\" In re Recticel  Foam Corp., 859\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1000, 1001 (1st Cir. 1988), spawned by the deadly fire which\n\nengulfed  the San Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel on  December 31, 1986.\n\nIn  this appeal, three  entities interested in  the ownership and\n\noperation of  the hotel  contest the  district  court's entry  of\n\nsummary judgment in favor  of a group of seventeen  insurers (the\n\npre-fire  insurers) whose  comprehensive general  liability (CGL)\n\nand  excess  insurance  policies  had  expired  before  the  fire\n\noccurred.1  Finding no error of law, we affirm.\n\n          We  recently traced the  six-year procedural history of\n\nthis gargantuan  litigation, see  In Re Nineteen  Appeals Arising\n                                                                 \n\nOut of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 982 F.2d 603,\n                                                  \n\n605-08 (1st Cir. 1992), and it would be pleonastic to repeat that\n\nexercise.  We remind the reader, however, that the district court\n\nsegmented  the liability inquiry into  three phases.   See id. at\n                                                              \n\n606.   This appeal concerns the third, and final, phase   a phase\n\ndesigned to  \"determin[e]  the contractual  liability of  various\n\ninsurers.\"  Id. at 606 n.3.\n               \n\n          The   district  court  wrote  a  lengthy  opinion  that\n\ndescribes  the  mechanics of  Phase III  and  we refer  those who\n\nthirst  for greater detail to that rescript.   See In Re San Juan\n                                                                 \n\nDupont  Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 802 F. Supp. 624, 629-30 (D.P.R.\n                               \n\n1992); see also id. at 652-57 (chronicling partial history of the\n                   \n\n                    \n\n     1The opinion below provides a complete list of  the insurers\nin question.   See In Re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,\n                                                                \n802 F. Supp. 624, 628 n.3 (D.P.R. 1992).\n\n                                2\n\ninsurance-related litigation).  To  put this appeal into workable\n\nperspective,  it suffices  to relate  that, during  Phase III,  a\n\ncovey  of cross-claimants,  comprising  forty-eight entities  who\n\nallegedly owned, operated, or managed the hotel, sought to recoup\n\nfrom the  pre-fire insurers some $78,000,000  which the entities,\n\ncollectively, had contributed to  settlement of victims' claims. \n\nFinding an absence  of coverage,  the district  court denied  the\n\ncross-claimants' requests for indemnification.  See id. at 651.\n                                                       \n\n          At this  juncture, forty-five cross-claimants  threw in\n\nthe  towel.   The remaining  three, Holders  Capital Corporation,\n\nHotel  Systems International, and  Dupont Plaza  Associates, were\n\narguably  made of  sterner  stuff.   They  appealed, hawking  the\n\ntheorem  that   defects  in   the  hotel,  apparent   before  the\n\nustulation, gave rise to the liability upon which the settlements\n\nwere based; and that, therefore, these payments reflect \"property\n\ndamage\"  of a kind covered  under the insuring  agreements of the\n\npolicies underwritten by the pre-fire insurers.2\n\n          We believe that appellants' theorem is  utterly without\n\nmerit.  To say that damages  for bodily injury and wrongful death\n\nare  really  \"property  damage\"  within the  ambit  of  carefully\n\nwritten  insurance  policies, and  then  to  argue that  coverage\n\nattaches  not when  the harm-producing  incident occurs  but when\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellants  chose to  limit their  appeal to  the \"property\ndamage\" theory, eschewing  further pursuit  of other  contentions\nthey  originally  espoused in  the  district  court.   Hence,  we\nconfine  our  comments to  the single  issue advanced  on appeal,\nmindful  that \"theories neither briefed nor  argued on appeal are\ndeemed  to have been waived.\"   United States  v. Slade, 980 F.2d\n                                                       \n27, 30 n.3 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                3\n\nalleged product  defects first become visible, is  to construct a\n\npyramidal proposition  more reminiscent of Lewis  Carroll than of\n\nthe  lexicon  of  insurance law.3    We  cannot  subscribe to  so\n\nfanciful  a  reading of  either  the appellees'  policies  or the\n\napplicable  precedents.    And,  moreover, because  we  find  the\n\ndistrict court's  opinion on this  point to be  well-reasoned and\n\nclearly articulated, see id. at 643-48, we will be brief.  Where,\n                            \n\nas here, a trial court has  produced a first-rate work product, a\n\nreviewing tribunal should hesitate  to wax longiloquent simply to\n\nhear its own  words resonate.  We  therefore affirm the  entry of\n\nsummary judgment in this  case substantially on the basis  of the\n\nopinion  below,  embellishing  our  affirmance  with  a decurtate\n\nexplanation of why  two recently decided cases, not considered by\n\nthe district court, fail to tip the scales in appellants' favor.\n\n          Relying heavily  on Eljer Mfg., Inc.  v. Liberty Mutual\n                                                                 \n\nIns. Co., 972 F.2d 805 (7th Cir. 1992), appellants argue that the\n        \n\ndistrict  court applied an incorrect rule of law.  Eljer involved\n                                                        \n\ndefective  plumbing  systems that  had  been  installed in  homes\n\nthroughout the  United States.  Citing  policy language identical\n\nto that  contained in several of the  CGL policies here at issue,\n\n                    \n\n     3One is reminded of Alice who, upon tumbling into the rabbit\nhole and finding  the garden  door locked, decided  to solve  her\ndilemma by  eating a piece of  cake.  \"`Well, I'll  eat it,' said\nAlice, `and if it makes me grow larger,  I can reach the key; and\nif  it makes  me grow  smaller, I  can creep  under the  door; so\neither  way I'll  get into  the garden,  and I  don't care  which\nhappens!'\"   Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures  In Wonderland 8-9\n                                                             \n(Delacorte Press ed.  1966).  Alice  enjoyed her snack    but she\nremained  the same size  and the garden  door remained inviolate.\nSee id. at 9.\n       \n\n                                4\n\nthe  manufacturer of the systems sought a declaration that it was\n\ncovered  for  damages  flowing  from leaks  occurring  after  its\n\npolicies  had lapsed.   A  divided panel  of the  Seventh Circuit\n\nupheld  the insured's  right to  coverage on  the basis  that the\n\n\"physical injury\" took place when the systems  were implanted not\n\nwhen  the leakage occurred and the latent harm materialized.  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 814.\n\n          We  refuse to  accord  Eljer controlling  weight for  a\n                                      \n\nmyriad of  reasons.  In the first  place, the Eljer court decided\n                                                   \n\nthe coverage issue  under Illinois law, see  id. at 806,  in part\n                                                \n\nthrough the use  of what it  termed \"first  principles.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n812.  To the extent that Eljer is good law  in Illinois, a matter\n                              \n\nabout which Judge  Cudahy disagreed, see  id. at 814-17  (Cudahy,\n                                             \n\nJ., dissenting),  and  upon which  we do  not opine,  we have  no\n\noccasion  to transplant  its holding  to a  case, like  this one,\n\nwhich is governed  by state  law requiring  a different  result.4\n\nSee, e.g., Albany  Ins. Co. v. Compania de  Desarrollo Comercial,\n                                                                \n\n90 JTS  19 (P.R. 1990); Maples  v. Aetna Casualty &amp;  Sur.

Rptr. 80 (1978).\n\n          In the second place, insofar as Eljer purports to claim\n                                               \n\nnationwide  application,  we   decline  the  invitation,  whether\n\n                    \n\n     4The district court saw no  need to make a choice of  law as\nto  whether  the pre-fire  insurers'  policies  were governed  by\nPuerto Rico or California law.   See In re Hotel Fire Litig., 802\n                                                            \nF. Supp. at 637 n.31.  Because Puerto Rico law and California law\ncoincide on the issue  presented in this appeal, we,  too, abjure\nsuch a choice.  See Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d\n                                                       \n1076, 1092 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (recognizing that a  court need  not\nmake a formal choice of law when nothing would turn on it).\n\n                                5\n\nproffered by appellants or  by the Eljer majority, to  supplant a\n                                        \n\nstate's body of  contract law with \"federal  general common law.\"\n\nErie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938).\n                         \n\n          In  the third  place, Eljer's  rule of  law  evolved in\n                                     \n\nconnection with, and was applied to, a markedly different factual\n\nsituation.   The  inherently defective  plumbing system  at issue\n\nthere was installed in hundreds of thousands of homes nationwide.\n\nSee Eljer, 972 F.2d at 807.  It bore the risk of leaking,  with a\n         \n\nfailure  rate   \"sufficiently  high   to  mark  the   product  as\n\ndefective,\" from the  moment of installation,  even when used  as\n\nintended.   Id. at 812.   By contrast, the products  found in the\n               \n\nDupont  Plaza   Hotel,  although  alleged  to   have  created  an\n\nunreasonable   danger  in  this  particular  instance,  were  not\n\ngenerally defective.  They functioned  properly, with no risk  of\n         \n\nfailure,  upon normal  use  and became  dangerous  only upon  the\n\noutbreak of the conflagration.\n\n          Fourth, and finally, the  property damage caused by the\n\ndefective plumbing systems was just that   property damage, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nclaims for  water damage  to  the victims'  homes, diminution  in\n\nproperty values,  loss of  use, costs  of replacing  the systems,\n\netc.   See  id. at  807.   Here,  however, unlike  in Eljer,  the\n                                                           \n\ninsureds' expenditures  were made  to recompense  personal injury\n\nand  wrongful death  claims rather  than property  damage claims.\n\nWhile it is true,  in a metaphysical sense, that  any expenditure\n\nof  funds from  a  party's estate  can  always be  visualized  as\n\nproperty  damage,  the term  \"property  damage\"  as  used in  the\n\n                                6\n\nappellees'  policies  is  a term  of  art.5   We  agree  with the\n\ndistrict court that the  term is not ambiguous and,  fairly read,\n\ntriggers coverage only when damage to property occurs  during the\n                                              \n\napplicable  policy period.

Arguing  that  the  district  court  \"did  not  have\n\nundisputed  material  facts allowing  it  to  decide between  the\n\nvarious trigger rules and to determine the  proper application of\n\nthe one that it chose,\" appellants maintain that summary judgment\n\nwas inappropriate.\n\n          Even assuming that California  law supplies the rule of\n\ndecision,  see  supra  note   4,  we  disagree  with  appellants'\n                     \n\ncharacterization  of the  sufficiency  of the  factual exposition\n\nbefore  the district  court.   Chemstar  makes  clear that  under\n                                       \n\nCalifornia law  \"insurance policies  are triggered when  property\n\ndamage actually occurs,  rather than when some prior wrongful act\n\nis committed.\"  Id. at 1548.  Indeed, the Chemstar court embarked\n                                                  \n\n                    \n\n     5This  term is precisely defined in most of the policies and\nis satisfactorily defined by the structure of the one policy that\ndoes  not contain an explicit  definition.  See  In re Hotel Fire\n                                                                 \nLitig., 802 F.

The\n\nrecord makes manifest that none of the hotel's property contained\n\nthe type  of latent defect  that would have  set the stage  for a\n\ncomplex determination of  the date damage  occurred.  Bearing  in\n\nmind the  illogic  of  the  proposition  that  products  fit  for\n\nordinary use can  be deemed defective  at all, we  are unable  to\n\nconceive of any evidentiary proffer that could alter the  obvious\n\ntrigger  date    and  appellants have  not  suggested, let  alone\n\ndocumented,  a viable scenario for such an alteration.  Here, the\n\ndamage  indisputably occurred on the date of the fire, well after\n\nthe  expiration of  the  insurance policies  underwritten by  the\n\nappellees.    Hence,  coverage  was  triggered  at  a  time  when\n\nappellees were no longer on the risk.\n\n          We  need go no further.  The supposed defects that were\n\napparent  in the  Dupont Plaza  Hotel before  the fire  and which\n\nallegedly contributed to  the victims' injuries  were not at  all\n\nrepresentative of the specie of \"property damage\" contemplated in\n\nthe pre-fire insurers' policies.  Because this is so, and because\n\nno  insured  loss took  place  during the  policy  period(s), the\n\ndistrict  court did not  err in  granting the  pre-fire insurers'\n\nmotion for brevis disposition.\n                 \n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                8\n",

To  put this appeal into workable\n\nperspective,  it suffices  to relate  that, during  Phase III,  a\n\ncovey  of cross-claimants,  comprising  forty-eight entities  who\n\nallegedly owned, operated, or managed the hotel, sought to recoup\n\nfrom the  pre-fire insurers some $78,000,000  which the entities,\n\ncollectively, had contributed to  settlement of victims' claims. \n\nFinding an absence  of coverage,  the district  court denied  the\n\ncross-claimants' requests for indemnification.  See id. at 651.\n                                                       \n\n          At this  juncture, forty-five cross-claimants  threw in\n\nthe  towel.   The remaining  three, Holders  Capital Corporation,\n\nHotel  Systems International, and  Dupont Plaza  Associates, were\n\narguably  made of  sterner  stuff.   They  appealed, hawking  the\n\ntheorem  that   defects  in   the  hotel,  apparent   before  the\n\nustulation, gave rise to the liability upon which the settlements\n\nwere based; and that, therefore, these payments reflect \"property\n\ndamage\"  of a kind covered  under the insuring  agreements of the\n\npolicies underwritten by the pre-fire insurers.2\n\n          We believe that appellants' theorem is  utterly without\n\nmerit.  To say that damages  for bodily injury and wrongful death\n\nare  really  \"property  damage\"  within the  ambit  of  carefully\n\nwritten  insurance  policies, and  then  to  argue that  coverage\n\nattaches  not when  the harm-producing  incident occurs  but when\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellants  chose to  limit their  appeal to  the \"property\ndamage\" theory, eschewing  further pursuit  of other  contentions\nthey  originally  espoused in  the  district  court.   Hence,  we\nconfine  our  comments to  the single  issue advanced  on appeal,\nmindful  that \"theories neither briefed nor  argued on appeal are\ndeemed  to have been waived.\"   United States  v.

And,  moreover, because  we  find  the\n\ndistrict court's  opinion on this  point to be  well-reasoned and\n\nclearly articulated, see id. at 643-48, we will be brief.

The  inherently defective  plumbing system  at issue\n\nthere was installed in hundreds of thousands of homes nationwide.\n\nSee Eljer, 972 F.2d at 807.  It bore the risk of leaking,  with a\n         \n\nfailure  rate   \"sufficiently  high   to  mark  the   product  as\n\ndefective,\" from the  moment of installation,  even when used  as\n\nintended.   Id. at 812.   By contrast, the products  found in the\n               \n\nDupont  Plaza   Hotel,  although  alleged  to   have  created  an\n\nunreasonable   danger  in  this  particular  instance,  were  not\n\ngenerally defective.  They functioned  properly, with no risk  of\n         \n\nfailure,  upon normal  use  and became  dangerous  only upon  the\n\noutbreak of the conflagration.\n\n          Fourth, and finally, the  property damage caused by the\n\ndefective plumbing systems was just that   property damage, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nclaims for  water damage  to  the victims'  homes, diminution  in\n\nproperty values,  loss of  use, costs  of replacing  the systems,\n\netc.   See  id. at  807.   Here,  however, unlike  in Eljer,  the\n                                                           \n\ninsureds' expenditures  were made  to recompense  personal injury\n\nand  wrongful death  claims rather  than property  damage claims.\n\nWhile it is true,  in a metaphysical sense, that  any expenditure\n\nof  funds from  a  party's estate  can  always be  visualized  as\n\nproperty  damage,  the term  \"property  damage\"  as  used in  the\n\n                                6\n\nappellees'  policies  is  a term  of  art.5   We  agree  with the\n\ndistrict court that the  term is not ambiguous and,  fairly read,\n\ntriggers coverage only when damage to property occurs  during the\n                                              \n\napplicable  policy period.

Cal.  1992), as  a basis for\n         \n\nurging that the dismissal of their coverage claims was premature.\n\nIn  particular,  they  brandish Chemstar's  acknowledgement  that\n                                        \n\nCalifornia   courts  have   adopted  more   than  one   rule  for\n\nascertaining the date upon which property damage occurs.  See id.\n                                                                 \n\nat  1549.    Arguing  that  the  district  court  \"did  not  have\n\nundisputed  material  facts allowing  it  to  decide between  the\n\nvarious trigger rules and to determine the  proper application of\n\nthe one that it chose,\" appellants maintain that summary judgment\n\nwas inappropriate.\n\n          Even assuming that California  law supplies the rule of\n\ndecision,  see  supra  note   4,  we  disagree  with  appellants'\n                     \n\ncharacterization  of the  sufficiency  of the  factual exposition\n\nbefore  the district  court.   Chemstar  makes  clear that  under\n                                       \n\nCalifornia law  \"insurance policies  are triggered when  property\n\ndamage actually occurs,  rather than when some prior wrongful act\n\nis committed.\"  Id. at 1548.  Indeed, the Chemstar court embarked\n                                                  \n\n                    \n\n     5This  term is precisely defined in most of the policies and\nis satisfactorily defined by the structure of the one policy that\ndoes  not contain an explicit  definition.  See  In re Hotel Fire\n                                                                 \nLitig., 802 F. Supp. at 645-46.\n      \n\n                                7\n\nupon a  discussion of  various  trigger rules  merely because  it\n\nobserved that,  in latent defect  cases, the \"date  when property\n\ndamage occurs is often difficult to pinpoint.\"  Id.\n                                                   \n\n          In  the case at bar,  no such difficulty  existed.  The\n\nrecord makes manifest that none of the hotel's property contained\n\nthe type  of latent defect  that would have  set the stage  for a\n\ncomplex determination of  the date damage  occurred.  Bearing  in\n\nmind the  illogic  of  the  proposition  that  products  fit  for\n\nordinary use can  be deemed defective  at all, we  are unable  to\n\nconceive of any evidentiary proffer that could alter the  obvious\n\ntrigger  date    and  appellants have  not  suggested, let  alone\n\ndocumented,  a viable scenario for such an alteration.  Here, the\n\ndamage  indisputably occurred on the date of the fire, well after\n\nthe  expiration of  the  insurance policies  underwritten by  the\n\nappellees.    Hence,  coverage  was  triggered  at  a  time  when\n\nappellees were no longer on the risk.\n\n          We  need go no further.  The supposed defects that were\n\napparent  in the  Dupont Plaza  Hotel before  the fire  and which\n\nallegedly contributed to  the victims' injuries  were not at  all\n\nrepresentative of the specie of \"property damage\" contemplated in\n\nthe pre-fire insurers' policies.  Because this is so, and because\n\nno  insured  loss took  place  during the  policy  period(s), the\n\ndistrict  court did not  err in  granting the  pre-fire insurers'\n\nmotion for brevis disposition.\n                 \n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                8\n</pre>",
