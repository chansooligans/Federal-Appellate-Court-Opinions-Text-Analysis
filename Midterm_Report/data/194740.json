The district court  dismissed Charles\n                    \n\nOropallo's  suit for a tax refund as untimely under 26 U.S.C.\n\n  6511(a).  We affirm.\n\n                    I.  Background\n                                  \n\n          Charles  Oropallo worked  for the  Raytheon Service\n\nCompany  during  the 1983  calendar year.    In 1985,  he was\n\nincarcerated.   Four years later the IRS informed him that he\n\nhad  not filed  any tax  returns since  1982.   Oropallo then\n\nobtained his W-2 form  from Raytheon.  When he filled out his\n\n1983 tax return, he discovered that he had overpaid his taxes\n\nby  approximately $698.   He  filed his  return on  March 19,\n\n1990, claiming that amount as a refund.  On May 23, 1990, the\n\nIRS  mailed him  a notice  disallowing his  claim, explaining\n\nthat it  could not \"refund or  credit tax that  was paid more\n\nthan 3  years before the filing  of the claim  . . . .\"   The\n\nnotice also told Oropallo  that he could sue to  recover \"any\n\ntax . . . or other amounts for which this disallowance notice\n\nis issued\" by filing suit in the appropriate federal district\n\ncourt  (or the U.S. Claims  Court) within two  years from the\n\nmailing date of the notice.  \n\n          Oropallo filed  suit in  the district  court within\n\nthe two-year period described by the disallowance notice.  He\n\nalleged   that   \"extremely   mitigating    and   extenuating\n\ncircumstances\"  explained his  failure to  file his  1983 tax\n\nreturn  on  time.   First, he  had  believed that  a six-year\n\nlimitations period applied.   Second, in  March 1983, he  had\n\nsuffered carbon monoxide poisoning which  left him \"extremely\n\nincapacitated and unable to function competently  for several\n\nyears\" and, for that reason, he had been \"completely unaware\"\n\nthat he  had not filed his  1983 tax return \"and  had in fact\n\nbelieved he had  timely filed said return.\"   Furthermore, he\n\nhad been in prison since 1985, prison authorities had impeded\n\nhis  legal efforts  on his  own behalf,  and although  he had\n\ninformed  the  U.S.  Post  Office of  address  changes  while\n\nincarcerated, he  had not  received notice  that  he had  not\n\nfiled the 1983 return until mid-1989.  \n\n          Without  waiting  for  the  government's  brief,  a\n\nmagistrate-judge recommended dismissing Oropallo's complaint,\n\nfinding that the suit was untimely under 26 U.S.C.    7422(a)\n\nand  6511(a) and  that  the court  therefore  had no  subject\n\nmatter  jurisdiction   over  the  suit  under   28  U.S.C.   \n\n1346(a)(1).    The   magistrate-judge  also  concluded   that\n\nOropallo's incarceration had not affected his ability to file\n\na  timely tax  return, since,  while incarcerated, he  had in\n\nfact  filed the return in question.  Oropallo objected to the\n\nmagistrate-judge's  recommendations.    He  noted   that  the\n\nmagistrate-judge  had  not   considered  his  alleged  carbon\n\nmonoxide poisoning before concluding that his late filing was\n\nnot excused, and he  offered as an additional reason  for his\n\ndelay  the  fact  that his  ex-wife  had  taken  his tax  and\n\nfinancial  records  in early  1984  and moved  to  an unknown\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\naddress.   Oropallo also argued that the IRS had consented to\n\nhis suit because the disallowance notice stated that he could\n\nbring  suit within  two years  from the  mailing date  of the\n\nletter and he had  done so.  The district  court subsequently\n\naccepted the magistrate-judge's recommendation  and dismissed\n\nOropallo's suit.\n\n          On appeal,  Oropallo alleges that the  dismissal of\n\nhis suit  violated his  constitutional rights under  both the\n\nUnited States  and New Hampshire Constitutions.  He says that\n\ndismissal of his  suit deprived him  of his property  without\n\ndue process of law and  of his right to access to  the courts\n\nto seek redress  for his  grievances.  He  also claims  that,\n\ngiven   the  circumstances   he  alleges,   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations   should  have   been  tolled.     Applying   the\n\nlimitations period to him, he argues, also violated his equal\n\nprotection rights under the Constitution since, as he claims,\n\nthe  IRS  can \"reach  back\" farther  in  time to  make claims\n\nagainst  taxpayers  than taxpayers  can  to recover  refunds.\n\nFinally,  Oropallo  asserts  that  the language  of  the  IRS\n\ndisallowance notice, stating that  he could bring suit within\n\ntwo  years of  the mailing  date of  the notice,  constituted\n\nconsent to his suit and waived any limitations bar.     W   e\n\naffirm for the reasons described below.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n                         II.  Discussion\n                                        \n\n          Since  the  statute  of limitations  and  equitable\n\ntolling issues are at the heart of this case, we address them\n\nfirst. \n\n          A.  Equitable Tolling of Section 6511(a) and (b)\n                                                          \n\n          As the district court noted, 28 U.S.C.   1346(a)(1)\n\ngives federal district courts jurisdiction over suits against\n\nthe United  States \"for the recovery  of any internal-revenue\n\ntax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or\n\ncollected.\"  Likewise, the  court correctly observed that the\n\njurisdictional grant  in section  1346(a)(1) must be  read to\n\nincorporate  the requirements  of  26 U.S.C.     7422(a)  and\n\n6511(a).   See United States  v. Dalm, 494  U.S. 596, 601-02,\n                                     \n\n608-10 (1990).  \n\n          Section  7422(a) provides  that no  suit for  a tax\n\nrefund may be maintained unless \"a claim for refund or credit\n\nhas been  duly filed  with the  Secretary,  according to  the\n\nprovisions  of law in that regard, and the regulations of the\n\nSecretary established in pursuance thereof.\"  Section 6511(a)\n\nstates that a refund claim must be filed \"within 3 years from\n\nthe time  the return was filed  or 2 years from  the time the\n\ntax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or\n\nif no return was filed  by the taxpayer, within 2  years from\n\nthe   time  the  tax  was   paid.\"    Thus,  section  6511(a)\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ndistinguishes between taxpayers  who file  returns and  those\n\nwho do  not.  Taxpayers who  file returns have  the longer of\n\nthree  years from  the time  they filed  their return  or two\n\nyears from the time they paid their taxes to file a claim for\n\nrefund,  whereas taxpayers  who have  not filed  returns have\n\nonly two years  from the time they  paid their taxes to  file\n\ntheir refund claims.   A  refund suit must  have been  timely\n\nfiled under one of the limitations periods in section 6511(a)\n\nfor the  district court to obtain jurisdiction over the suit.\n\nDalm, 494 U.S. at 609.  \n    \n\n          The  district  court did  not  explain clearly  how\n\nOropallo's  claim was  untimely under  section 6511(a).   Its\n\nopinion  contained language  which would  support either  the\n\nconclusion  that it  had applied  the three-year  limitations\n\nperiod for  taxpayers filing returns  or that it  had applied\n\nthe shorter two-year limitations period for taxpayers who did\n\nnot  file returns.   The  government urges  us to  affirm the\n\ndistrict   court's  implicit   holding   that  the   two-year\n\nlimitations period for nonfiling  taxpayers applies and  that\n\nOropallo's  late  return is  not  a  \"return\" which  triggers\n\napplication of  the three-year limitations period.   Although\n\nit acknowledges that  there is  a split in  authority on  the\n\nquestion  whether  a return  filed after  its  due date  is a\n\n\"return\"  within the  meaning  of section  6511(a),  compare,\n                                                             \n\ne.g.,  Musser v. Commissioner, 92-1  USTC   50,245 (D. Alaska\n                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n1991) (the two-year limitations period measured from the time\n\nthe tax  was  paid is  applicable  to taxpayers  filing  late\n\nreturns),  with Mills v. United States, 805 F. Supp. 448, 450\n                                      \n\n(E.D. Tex. 1992) (the three-year limitations period beginning\n\nwhen the return  is filed applies to a taxpayer filing a late\n\nreturn), the government argues  that a finding that taxpayers\n\nfiling late returns have  only two years from the  time their\n\ntaxes are  paid  to file  refund claims  better reflects  the\n\nstatutory language.  \n\n          We need not resolve  this question in light  of our\n\ndetermination  on the  tolling issue.    For purposes  of our\n\npresent  analysis,  therefore,  we  assume for  the  sake  of\n\nargument  that  the cases  holding that  a  late return  is a\n\n\"return\" within  the meaning of section  6511(a) are correct.\n\nAccordingly, we also assume that, if Oropallo filed his claim\n\nfor a refund  within three  years of his  return, his  refund\n\nclaim  would be timely.   Under 26 C.F.R.    301.6402-3(a), a\n\nreturn which claims a  refund may be considered a  \"claim for\n\nrefund\" under section 6511(a).   Oropallo's return, which was\n\nfiled  on March 19, 1990,  claimed a refund.   Therefore, the\n\nclaim, having been filed on the same day as his return, would\n\nobviously have been filed within three years of the filing of\n\nthe return and so was timely.  \n\n          This assumption, however, does not mean victory for\n\nOropallo.    As the  government  says, section  6511(b)(2)(A)\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nplaces a cap  on recovery  of a refund  which, in  Oropallo's\n\ncase,  prevents recovery of any  taxes paid for  the 1983 tax\n\nyear.  Specifically, section 6511(b)(2)(A) states that,  with\n\nrespect to  a claim  filed  during the  three-year period  in\n\nsection  6511(a), the amount of the refund is limited to \"the\n\nportion  of  the  tax  paid within  the  period,  immediately\n\npreceding the filing of the claim, equal to 3 years plus  the\n\nperiod of  any  extension of  time  for filing  the  return.\"\n\nSince  Oropallo filed  his claim  on March  19, 1990,  he may\n\nrecover only taxes paid in the preceding three years -- i.e.,\n\nany  taxes  paid  on  or  after March  19,  1987.    (As  the\n\ngovernment notes,  Oropallo has not claimed  that he received\n\nany extension  of time for filing his 1983 return.)  Under 26\n\nU.S.C.    6513(b)(1),  Oropallo's taxes  were deemed  paid on\n\nApril 15, 1984,  well before  the cut-off date  of March  19,\n\n1987.  Therefore,  he may  not recover any  portion of  those\n\ntaxes.  \n\n          Section  6511(b)(2)(A)  explicitly  forecloses  any\n\nrefund  for  taxes  not  paid within  the  three-year  period\n\npreceding  the  date  the  claim was  filed.1    Essentially,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Thus, where the  taxes sought to be  recovered are deemed\npaid as  of the date the return was due (and no extension for\nfiling the return was granted), a return such as  Oropallo's,\nwhich  itself is the refund claim, must be filed within three\nyears of  its due date for the taxpayer to be able to recover\nany  of the  taxes  paid.    Basically,  for  a  taxpayer  in\nOropallo's  situation,  section  6511(a) and  (b)(2)(A)  work\ntogether  with  section  6513(b)(1)  to  impose  a three-year\nstatute of  limitations on  refund claims, measured  from the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ntherefore,  it establishes  an additional  limitations period\n\nseparate from the three-year period in section 6511(a).  See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Mills v.  United States,  805 F. Supp.  448, 450  (E.D.\n                             \n\nTex.  1992) (for  a  taxpayer who  has  filed a  return,  the\n\nprovisions of  section 6511(a)  and (b)(2)(A) establish  \"two\n\nlimitations  hurdles\" --  (1)  a refund  claim must  be filed\n\nwithin three years after the tax return is filed, and (2) the\n\namounts sought to be recovered  must actually have been  paid\n\nin the  three-year period preceding the filing of the claim).\n\nThat additional  limitations period effectively  bars some of\n\nthe refund claims which  would be unquestionably timely under\n\nsection 6511(a).   See, e.g.,  Rainey v. United  States, 82-2\n                                                       \n\nUSTC    9442 (N.D. Ala.  1982) (the taxpayer's  claim was not\n\nuntimely  under  section 6511(a),  but  it  was denied  under\n\nsection  6511(b)(2)(A) because  the taxes  had not  been paid\n\nwithin  the prescribed  period before  the claim  was filed);\n\nMcGregor  v. United States, 80-2  USTC   9647  (Ct. Cl. 1980)\n                          \n\n(same).    Accordingly,  unless  the  additional  limitations\n\nperiod imposed  by section 6511(b)(2)(A) is equitably tolled,\n\nOropallo's action should be dismissed.  \n\n                    \n\noriginal due date of  the tax return.   See Tallon v.  United\n                                                             \nStates, 84-2  USTC   9926 (C.D. Ill.  1984) (after discussing\n      \nthe effect  of sections  6511(b)(2)(A) and 6513(b)(1)  on the\ntaxpayers'  timely refund  claim, which  was made  in a  late\nreturn, the  court concluded  that \"the Plaintiffs  have been\nbarred from recovering their refund by failure to  file their\nreturns within three years of the time they were due\"). \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          2.  Equitable Tolling\n                               \n\n          Oropallo argues that the limitations  period should\n\nbe  tolled   \"[i]n  the  interests  of   justice\"  given  the\n\n\"extremely mitigating and  extenuating circumstances\" of  his\n\ncase.    In  our  opinion,  only  Oropallo's  alleged  carbon\n\nmonoxide poisoning could  qualify for that characterization.2\n\nThe  government  interprets  Oropallo's  argument  to  be  an\n\nattempt to invoke either the mitigation provisions of the tax\n\ncode,  26 U.S.C.      1311-14, or  the  judicial doctrine  of\n\nequitable recoupment.   It correctly points  out that neither\n\nthe  mitigation  provisions  nor  the   equitable  recoupment\n\ndoctrine apply.   In view  of Oropallo's status  as a  pro se\n                                                             \n\npetitioner,  however, we  think we have  an obligation  to go\n\nbeyond the government's  brief and to take  account of recent\n\n                    \n\n2.  We assume that carbon monoxide  poisoning, which Oropallo\nalleges  not only  incapacitated him  for several  years, but\nalso deprived  him of  his ability  to know that  he had  not\nfiled  a  1983  tax  return,  would  be analogous  to  mental\nincapacity and  thus could be a ground  for equitable tolling\nif  Oropallo  could  show  that  his  alleged  poisoning  had\nactually prevented him from filing his 1983 return on time or\nfrom remembering earlier than  1989 that he had not  done so.\nSee  Lopez v.  Citibank, N.A.,  808 F.2d  905, 907  (1st Cir.\n                             \n1987)  (assuming, in  a  suit between  private parties,  that\nmental  illness   \"might  sometimes   toll  the   statute  of\nlimitations,\" the court concluded that it did not do so where\nthe plaintiff was represented by counsel at the relevant time\nand  so was not actually prevented from timely filing suit by\nhis mental illness).  The other grounds for equitable tolling\nwhich  Oropallo alleges do not  appear to have  caused him to\ndelay filing his return, either  in 1983 or in 1989 after  he\nlearned that his  1983 return had  not been filed.   For that\nreason, we  do not see how they could be found to excuse that\ndelay.  \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndevelopments  in  the  law which  are  not  discussed by  the\n\ngovernment.\n\n          Before 1990,  Oropallo would have had  no basis for\n\nclaiming that the limitations  periods in section 6511 should\n\nbe equitably  tolled.  Courts traditionally  have declined to\n\napply equitable  principles to  toll statutes  of limitations\n\nagainst  the United  States, on  the theory  that  the United\n\nStates could  be sued  only by  virtue of  its waiver of  its\n\nsovereign  immunity and that the terms of any such waiver had\n\nto be strictly construed.

Cf. Schmidt v. United  States, 933\n                                                        \nF.2d 639, 640 (8th Cir. 1991) (in an action under the Federal\nTort Claims Act after Irwin, the government has the burden of\n                           \nestablishing  the statute  of limitations  as an  affirmative\ndefense). \n\n5.

In  Vintilla, the  taxpayer had been  required to  pay\n                   \nupfront the entire  tax due on his  severance benefit whereas\nsimilarly situated  taxpayers paid taxes as  if receiving the\nbenefit  in installments.  The IRS had told the taxpayer that\na  refund claim could be filed after he litigated the mode of\npayment of  the severance  benefit; after the  litigation had\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nrelevant analysis has been altered yet again by a more recent\n\nSupreme Court decision.

Ct.  2773 (1991),\n                      \n\nthe  Supreme  Court considered  whether  to  adopt a  federal\n\nlimitations period  in private  suits under section  10(b) of\n\nthe  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, if so, whether that\n\nperiod would  be subject  to equitable  tolling.6  The  Court\n\nconcluded  that  a  federal  limitations   period  should  be\n\nadopted.   It selected  the 1-and-3-year  limitations periods\n\ncontained  in  the  1934 Act  and  in  the original  remedial\n\n                    \n\nended,  however,  the  IRS  denied the  taxpayer's  claim  as\nuntimely.\n\n6.  Although  Lampf  involved   a  lawsuit  between   private\n                   \nparties, it is clearly  relevant here.  As the  Supreme Court\nstated  in  Irwin,  equitable  tolling  principles  in  suits\n                 \nagainst  the  government  should  be  consistent  with  those\napplied  against private  defendants, and should  be employed\n\"no  more  favorabl[y]\" against  the government  than against\nprivate defendants.  Irwin, 111 S. Ct. at 457, 458.  \n                          \n     Nor do  we think that  Lampf is inapplicable  because it\n                                 \nconsidered a statute of  limitations applicable to bringing a\nlawsuit rather than time  limits imposed on the filing  of an\nadministrative claim.  If  a specific equitable consideration\nwould justify tolling the limitations period for filing suit,\nthat same equitable consideration should  justify tolling the\nadministrative  time  limits  which  have  been  held  to  be\nprerequisites  to  bringing  suit.   See  Johnsen  v.  United\n                                                             \nStates,  758 F.

Citing Irwin,  the Court acknowledged\n                                    \n\nthat time  limits in law  suits are \"customarily\"  subject to\n\nequitable  tolling.  It also agreed that, in fraud cases, the\n\nlimitations period  does not usually begin  running until the\n\nfraud is discovered.  Nevertheless,  the Court held that time\n\nlimits,  expressed as  in section 9(e),  were not  subject to\n\nequitable tolling.  In the Court's view, it was \"evident that\n\nthe equitable tolling  doctrine is fundamentally inconsistent\n\nwith the 1-and-3-year structure.\"  Id. at 2782.  It explained\n                                      \n\nwhat it meant as follows:\n\n          The 1-year  period,  by  its  terms,  begins  after\n          discovery of the facts constituting  the violation,\n          making tolling unnecessary.   The 3-year limit is a\n          period of  repose inconsistent with tolling.  . . .\n          \"[T]he inclusion of the  three-year period can have\n          no  significance  in  this  context  other  than to\n          impose  an  outside  limit.\"  (Citations  omitted.)\n          Because the  purpose of  the  3-year limitation  is\n          clearly to serve as a cutoff, we hold that  tolling\n          principles do not apply to that period.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          We  think that  section 6511(a)  and (b)(2)(A)  are\n\nstructured like the 1-and-3-period considered  by the Supreme\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nCourt in Lampf.  Under section 6511, a taxpayer who has filed\n              \n\na return must clear two  time barriers.  The first one  is in\n\nsection 6511(a),  which requires  taxpayers to file  a refund\n\nclaim within three years of filing a return.  We have assumed\n\nthat a return can be filed at any time after its due date and\n\nstill be a return for purposes of  filing a claim within that\n\nthree-year   period.     Under   that   interpretation,   the\n\nlimitations period in  section 6511(a)  is totally  illusory.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Mills  v. United States,  805 F.  Supp. 448, 451\n                                    \n\n(E.D. Tex. 1992) (section 6511(a) would \"permit a taxpayer to\n\nfile a tax  return 40 years late and still  have 3 additional\n\nyears  in which  to  file a  claim  for  refund\").   In  this\n\nrespect,  the   three-year  period  in  section   6511(a)  is\n\nanalogous to  the one-year  period discussed  in Lampf.   The\n                                                      \n\none-year  period requires only that suit  be filed within one\n\nyear  after discovery  of the  facts which  give rise  to the\n\ncause  of action.  Since  the discovery of  those facts could\n\noccur any number of  years after the statutory violation  had\n\nactually taken place, the 1-year period sets no real limit on\n\nwhen suit can be brought.  \n\n          The  analogy  between  the  limitations  period  in\n\nsection  6511(a) and  the 1-year  period typified  by section\n\n9(e)  extends even  further.   In  Lampf,  the Supreme  Court\n                                        \n\ncommented  that the  one-year  period for  filing suit  after\n\ndiscovery of the  facts giving  rise to the  cause of  action\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nmade  tolling unnecessary.  Lampf, 111  S. Ct. at 2782.  What\n                                 \n\nthe  Court obviously meant was that once someone who has been\n\ndefrauded knows  the relevant facts, the  1-year period gives\n\nthat  person ample time in which to  sue and there is no need\n\nto  toll the 1-year limitations  period.  A  similar state of\n\nknowledge respecting the right to a refund can  be attributed\n\nto  individual calendar  year taxpayers  who file  income tax\n\nreturns.   The return contains all  the information necessary\n\nto verify that  there has  been an overpayment  of taxes  and\n\nthat  a refund is due.  Accordingly, the three-year period in\n\nsection 6511(a)  gives  the taxpayer  ample  time to  file  a\n\nrefund claim, and there is no need to toll that period.\n\n          Essentially, then, section 6511(a) serves simply to\n\nidentify which taxpayers have properly  positioned themselves\n\nto  obtain  a  refund.   Like  the  1-year  period in  Lampf,\n                                                            \n\nhowever,  it  does  not  describe which  of  those  potential\n\nclaimants  will actually  succeed  in pursuing  their rights.\n\nThat  task   is  left   to   section  6511(b)(2)(A),   which,\n\nsignificantly,   the  tax   code  characterizes   not   as  a\n\nlimitations period, but as a \"limit on [the] amount of credit\n\nor  refund.\"  See 26  U.S.C.   6511(b)(2)(A)  (caption).7  As\n                 \n\n                    \n\n7.  Section 6511(b)(2)(A) works together with section 6511(a)\nand section 6513(b)(1) to  bar recovery of any refund  claims\non  late returns not filed  within three years  after the due\ndate  of  the return,  and thus  it  clearly operates  like a\nstatute of limitations.  However, Congress's characterization\nof section  6511(b)(2)(A)  as a  \"limit  on [the]  amount  of\ncredit  or  refund\"  rather  than  as  a  limitations  period\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nwe  said  earlier, section  6511(b)(2)(A)  limits  the refund\n\nrecoverable to  the  amount of  tax  paid in  the  three-year\n\nperiod immediately preceding the filing of the claim.  For an\n\nindividual   calendar  year  taxpayer  like  Oropallo,  taxes\n\nwithheld  from wages during the  tax year are  deemed paid on\n\nApril  15th  of the  following year,  the  date when  the tax\n\nreturn is due.  See 26 U.S.C.   6513(b)(1).  For that reason,\n                   \n\nif the  return is not filed and the claim not made within the\n\nthree   years  immediately   following  that   date,  section\n\n6511(b)(2)(A)  precludes the  recovery  of any  of the  taxes\n\npaid. \n\n          Here,  Oropallo's 1983  taxes were  deemed  paid on\n\nApril  15, 1984,  and his  refund claim  was timely  filed on\n\nMarch 19,  1990, the  same day  he filed  his return.   Under\n\nsection 6511(b)(2)(A)  he may recover  any taxes paid  in the\n\nimmediately  preceding three-year period,  i.e., on  or after\n\nMarch  19,  1987.   But all  of the  taxes Oropallo  seeks to\n\nrecover were paid before March 19, 1987, and thus he recovers\n\nnothing.    Unquestionably,  then,  that date  serves  as  an\n\nabsolute  cut-off point.   By imposing an  \"outside limit\" or\n\n\"cut-off\"  on the  amount of  taxes which  can be  recovered,\n\nsection 6511(b)(2)(A) operates like the three-year portion of\n\nthe limitations period  in Lampf,  and thus is  a \"period  of\n                                \n\n                    \n\nindicates more clearly than a simple limitations period would\nthat Congress intended  to establish an outside limit  on the\nrecovery of refunds.  \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nrepose inconsistent with tolling\".

Remaining Claims\n                              \n\n          Oropallo's  remaining claims are  without merit for\n\nthe  reasons stated in the government's brief.  We comment on\n\nseveral claims only.      \n\n          At the  heart of  Oropallo's due process  claims is\n\nthe  contention that  he  should have  been  given a  hearing\n\nbefore his refund  claim was denied  and his suit  dismissed.\n\nThe short answer is that  an administrative hearing would not\n\nhave changed  the outcome for  Oropallo.  The  critical facts\n\nrelating  to  the date  Oropallo's  taxes were  paid  and his\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nrefund claim filed are not disputed.  In view of those facts,\n\nsection  6511 unquestionably bars  Oropallo's recovery of any\n\nportion of his 1983  taxes.  Furthermore, it is  well settled\n\nthat post-collection judicial  review accords a  taxpayer all\n\nthe process that is due under our tax laws.  Martinez v. IRS,\n                                                            \n\n744 F.2d 71, 72 (10th Cir. 1984); Rosenberg  v. Commissioner,\n                                                            \n\n450 F.2d 529, 533  (10th Cir. 1971) (\"[d]ue process  does not\n\nrequire a hearing at  the initial stage or at  any particular\n\npoint of  an administrative proceeding\"); cf.  Kahn v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 753 F.2d 1208,  1218-19 (3d Cir. 1985)  (stating that\n      \n\nthe   principle  that  post-collection   judicial  review  is\n\nconstitutionally sufficient does not  apply where a  taxpayer\n\nhas to  pay part of a  disputed penalty before  being able to\n\nseek  judicial review,  the  court  weighed the  government's\n\ninterests against  the taxpayer's, but  concluded nonetheless\n\nthat   no   pre-collection   hearing   was   constitutionally\n\nrequired).   Both  this court  and  the district  court  have\n\nreviewed the IRS's denial of Oropallo's refund claim and have\n\nissued opinions  explaining that his claim  is barred because\n\nit was  untimely.   Thus,  Oropallo  has received  the  post-\n\ncollection judicial review to which he was entitled.  Second,\n\nOropallo argues that the  disallowance notice and various IRS\n\npublications   referring  to  a   two-year  period  for  suit\n\nconstituted governmental consent to his suit which waived the\n\ntime bar.   This argument fails to appreciate the distinction\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nbetween  a  taxpayer's right  to  bring a  lawsuit  to review\n\nadministrative action and the taxpayer's  separate obligation\n\nto pursue  first the administrative  procedures prescribed in\n\nthe  tax code.   Section 6532(a)(1)  of the  Internal Revenue\n\nCode contains  the two-year  limitations period in  question.\n\nIt  requires a  taxpayer  suing for  a  refund under  section\n\n7422(a) to bring suit within two years after the mailing date\n\nof a disallowance  notice.   As is evident  from the  record,\n\nOropallo  complied  with  that  requirement.     But  section\n\n6532(a)(1) regulates only  the time  for bringing  a suit  to\n\nreview  the denial of an administrative claim.  The Code also\n\nimposes certain administrative requirements respecting refund\n\nclaims  which  Oropallo  was   required  to  follow.    Those\n\nadministrative requirements are contained in sections 7422(a)\n\nand 6511, see Rosenbluth Trading, Inc. v. United  States, 736\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 43, 45 n.1 (2d Cir. 1984), and have been discussed fully\n\nin this opinion.   Thus, Oropallo is right in saying  that he\n\ncomplied  with  the  two-year   period  referred  to  in  the\n\ndisallowance notice,  but that  notice could not  have waived\n\nhis separate obligation to pursue his administrative remedies\n\nin  a timely  fashion.   See Allen v.  United States,  439 F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp.  463,  465  (C.D.  Cal.  1977)  (a  notice  disallowing\n\ntaxpayer's  refund  claim  as  untimely  did  not  waive  the\n\ngovernment's  limitations defense  under  section 6511(a)  by\n\nstating that the  taxpayer had  two years in  which to  bring\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nsuit, but \"merely . . . notif[ied] the Plaintiff of his right\n\nto   contest   the   government's   interpretation   of   the\n\napplicability of the statute of limitations\").\n\n          Finally,  Oropallo claims that his equal protection\n\nrights  have been  violated because  the IRS  can reach  back\n\nfarther in time  to collect taxes  than he  can to collect  a\n\nrefund.  We think that Oropallo would be hard-pressed to show\n\nthat he and the IRS are similarly situated parties in the tax\n\ncollection context  so as  to make equal  protection analysis\n\napplicable.   Cf. Musser v. United States, 92-1 USTC   50,245\n                                         \n\n(D. Alaska 1991) (it is not discriminatory for the government\n\nto have a longer period to sue for recovery  of erroneous tax\n\nrefunds  than a taxpayer is allowed to sue for overpayment of\n\ntaxes  since the IRS deals  with millions of  tax returns per\n\nyear while a  taxpayer typically  has only one  return to  be\n\nconcerned about each  year).  In any  event, we find  no such\n\nviolation here.  As the  government observes, in one  respect\n\nOropallo's claim  is factually wrong.   Just as  the taxpayer\n\nhas three  years from the date  of filing a return  to file a\n\nrefund  claim, so  the  government generally  has only  three\n\nyears  from the date a  return is filed  to make a deficiency\n\nassessment.    See  26 U.S.C.     6501(a).    As our  opinion\n                  \n\nexplains,  however, section  6511(a) and  (b)(2)(A), together\n\nwith section 6513(b)(1), effectively  impose on a taxpayer in\n\nOropallo's  situation  an  additional,   absolute  three-year\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nlimitations period  on refund  claims beginning the  date the\n\nreturn was due.  The government does not appear to be subject\n\nto  that   limitations  period  in   assessing  deficiencies.\n\nNevertheless,  the  apparent  disparate  treatment  does  not\n\nviolate Oropallo's constitutional rights.   It seems  obvious\n\nto  us that,  if  the  government  were  held  to  that  same\n\nadditional limitations  period, any taxpayer could  (and many\n\nmight)  prevent  the   government  from   ever  assessing   a\n\ndeficiency  merely by  waiting to  file a return  until three\n\nyears after its  due date,  an outcome  that would  seriously\n\nundermine the collection of taxes.  \n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n",

The district court  dismissed Charles\n                    \n\nOropallo's  suit for a tax refund as untimely under 26 U.S.C.\n\n  6511(a).  We affirm.\n\n                    I.  Background\n                                  \n\n          Charles  Oropallo worked  for the  Raytheon Service\n\nCompany  during  the 1983  calendar year.    In 1985,  he was\n\nincarcerated.   Four years later the IRS informed him that he\n\nhad  not filed  any tax  returns since  1982.   Oropallo then\n\nobtained his W-2 form  from Raytheon.  When he filled out his\n\n1983 tax return, he discovered that he had overpaid his taxes\n\nby  approximately $698.   He  filed his  return on  March 19,\n\n1990, claiming that amount as a refund.  On May 23, 1990, the\n\nIRS  mailed him  a notice  disallowing his  claim, explaining\n\nthat it  could not \"refund or  credit tax that  was paid more\n\nthan 3  years before the filing  of the claim  . . . .\"   The\n\nnotice also told Oropallo  that he could sue to  recover \"any\n\ntax . . . or other amounts for which this disallowance notice\n\nis issued\" by filing suit in the appropriate federal district\n\ncourt  (or the U.S. Claims  Court) within two  years from the\n\nmailing date of the notice.  \n\n          Oropallo filed  suit in  the district  court within\n\nthe two-year period described by the disallowance notice.  He\n\nalleged   that   \"extremely   mitigating    and   extenuating\n\ncircumstances\"  explained his  failure to  file his  1983 tax\n\nreturn  on  time.   First, he  had  believed that  a six-year\n\nlimitations period applied.   Second, in  March 1983, he  had\n\nsuffered carbon monoxide poisoning which  left him \"extremely\n\nincapacitated and unable to function competently  for several\n\nyears\" and, for that reason, he had been \"completely unaware\"\n\nthat he  had not filed his  1983 tax return \"and  had in fact\n\nbelieved he had  timely filed said return.\"   Furthermore, he\n\nhad been in prison since 1985, prison authorities had impeded\n\nhis  legal efforts  on his  own behalf,  and although  he had\n\ninformed  the  U.S.  Post  Office of  address  changes  while\n\nincarcerated, he  had not  received notice  that  he had  not\n\nfiled the 1983 return until mid-1989.  \n\n          Without  waiting  for  the  government's  brief,  a\n\nmagistrate-judge recommended dismissing Oropallo's complaint,\n\nfinding that the suit was untimely under 26 U.S.C.    7422(a)\n\nand  6511(a) and  that  the court  therefore  had no  subject\n\nmatter  jurisdiction   over  the  suit  under   28  U.S.C.   \n\n1346(a)(1).    The   magistrate-judge  also  concluded   that\n\nOropallo's incarceration had not affected his ability to file\n\na  timely tax  return, since,  while incarcerated, he  had in\n\nfact  filed the return in question.  Oropallo objected to the\n\nmagistrate-judge's  recommendations.    He  noted   that  the\n\nmagistrate-judge  had  not   considered  his  alleged  carbon\n\nmonoxide poisoning before concluding that his late filing was\n\nnot excused, and he  offered as an additional reason  for his\n\ndelay  the  fact  that his  ex-wife  had  taken  his tax  and\n\nfinancial  records  in early  1984  and moved  to  an unknown\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\naddress.   Oropallo also argued that the IRS had consented to\n\nhis suit because the disallowance notice stated that he could\n\nbring  suit within  two years  from the  mailing date  of the\n\nletter and he had  done so.  The district  court subsequently\n\naccepted the magistrate-judge's recommendation  and dismissed\n\nOropallo's suit.\n\n          On appeal,  Oropallo alleges that the  dismissal of\n\nhis suit  violated his  constitutional rights under  both the\n\nUnited States  and New Hampshire Constitutions.  He says that\n\ndismissal of his  suit deprived him  of his property  without\n\ndue process of law and  of his right to access to  the courts\n\nto seek redress  for his  grievances.  He  also claims  that,\n\ngiven   the  circumstances   he  alleges,   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations   should  have   been  tolled.     Applying   the\n\nlimitations period to him, he argues, also violated his equal\n\nprotection rights under the Constitution since, as he claims,\n\nthe  IRS  can \"reach  back\" farther  in  time to  make claims\n\nagainst  taxpayers  than taxpayers  can  to recover  refunds.\n\nFinally,  Oropallo  asserts  that  the language  of  the  IRS\n\ndisallowance notice, stating that  he could bring suit within\n\ntwo  years of  the mailing  date of  the notice,  constituted\n\nconsent to his suit and waived any limitations bar.     W   e\n\naffirm for the reasons described below.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n                         II.  Discussion\n                                        \n\n          Since  the  statute  of limitations  and  equitable\n\ntolling issues are at the heart of this case, we address them\n\nfirst. \n\n          A.  Equitable Tolling of Section 6511(a) and (b)\n                                                          \n\n          As the district court noted, 28 U.S.C.   1346(a)(1)\n\ngives federal district courts jurisdiction over suits against\n\nthe United  States \"for the recovery  of any internal-revenue\n\ntax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or\n\ncollected.\"  Likewise, the  court correctly observed that the\n\njurisdictional grant  in section  1346(a)(1) must be  read to\n\nincorporate  the requirements  of  26 U.S.C.     7422(a)  and\n\n6511(a).   See United States  v. Dalm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112395\"><a href=\"/opinion/112395/united-states-v-dalm/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601-02,\n                                     \n\n608-10 (1990).  \n\n          Section  7422(a) provides  that no  suit for  a tax\n\nrefund may be maintained unless \"a claim for refund or credit\n\nhas been  duly filed  with the  Secretary,  according to  the\n\nprovisions  of law in that regard, and the regulations of the\n\nSecretary established in pursuance thereof.\"  Section 6511(a)\n\nstates that a refund claim must be filed \"within 3 years from\n\nthe time  the return was filed  or 2 years from  the time the\n\ntax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or\n\nif no return was filed  by the taxpayer, within 2  years from\n\nthe   time  the  tax  was   paid.\"    Thus,  section  6511(a)\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ndistinguishes between taxpayers  who file  returns and  those\n\nwho do  not.  Taxpayers who  file returns have  the longer of\n\nthree  years from  the time  they filed  their return  or two\n\nyears from the time they paid their taxes to file a claim for\n\nrefund,  whereas taxpayers  who have  not filed  returns have\n\nonly two years  from the time they  paid their taxes to  file\n\ntheir refund claims.   A  refund suit must  have been  timely\n\nfiled under one of the limitations periods in section 6511(a)\n\nfor the  district court to obtain jurisdiction over the suit.\n\nDalm, 494 U.S. at 609.  \n    \n\n          The  district  court did  not  explain clearly  how\n\nOropallo's  claim was  untimely under  section 6511(a).   Its\n\nopinion  contained language  which would  support either  the\n\nconclusion  that it  had applied  the three-year  limitations\n\nperiod for  taxpayers filing returns  or that it  had applied\n\nthe shorter two-year limitations period for taxpayers who did\n\nnot  file returns.   The  government urges  us to  affirm the\n\ndistrict   court's  implicit   holding   that  the   two-year\n\nlimitations period for nonfiling  taxpayers applies and  that\n\nOropallo's  late  return is  not  a  \"return\" which  triggers\n\napplication of  the three-year limitations period.

Tex. 1992) (the three-year limitations period beginning\n\nwhen the return  is filed applies to a taxpayer filing a late\n\nreturn), the government argues  that a finding that taxpayers\n\nfiling late returns have  only two years from the  time their\n\ntaxes are  paid  to file  refund claims  better reflects  the\n\nstatutory language.  \n\n          We need not resolve  this question in light  of our\n\ndetermination  on the  tolling issue.    For purposes  of our\n\npresent  analysis,  therefore,  we  assume for  the  sake  of\n\nargument  that  the cases  holding that  a  late return  is a\n\n\"return\" within  the meaning of section  6511(a) are correct.\n\nAccordingly, we also assume that, if Oropallo filed his claim\n\nfor a refund  within three  years of his  return, his  refund\n\nclaim  would be timely.   Under 26 C.F.R.    301.6402-3(a), a\n\nreturn which claims a  refund may be considered a  \"claim for\n\nrefund\" under section 6511(a).   Oropallo's return, which was\n\nfiled  on March 19, 1990,  claimed a refund.   Therefore, the\n\nclaim, having been filed on the same day as his return, would\n\nobviously have been filed within three years of the filing of\n\nthe return and so was timely.  \n\n          This assumption, however, does not mean victory for\n\nOropallo.    As the  government  says, section  6511(b)(2)(A)\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nplaces a cap  on recovery  of a refund  which, in  Oropallo's\n\ncase,  prevents recovery of any  taxes paid for  the 1983 tax\n\nyear.  Specifically, section 6511(b)(2)(A) states that,  with\n\nrespect to  a claim  filed  during the  three-year period  in\n\nsection  6511(a), the amount of the refund is limited to \"the\n\nportion  of  the  tax  paid within  the  period,  immediately\n\npreceding the filing of the claim, equal to 3 years plus  the\n\nperiod of  any  extension of  time  for filing  the  return.\"\n\nSince  Oropallo filed  his claim  on March  19, 1990,  he may\n\nrecover only taxes paid in the preceding three years -- i.e.,\n\nany  taxes  paid  on  or  after March  19,  1987.    (As  the\n\ngovernment notes,  Oropallo has not claimed  that he received\n\nany extension  of time for filing his 1983 return.)  Under 26\n\nU.S.C.    6513(b)(1),  Oropallo's taxes  were deemed  paid on\n\nApril 15, 1984,  well before  the cut-off date  of March  19,\n\n1987.  Therefore,  he may  not recover any  portion of  those\n\ntaxes.  \n\n          Section  6511(b)(2)(A)  explicitly  forecloses  any\n\nrefund  for  taxes  not  paid within  the  three-year  period\n\npreceding  the  date  the  claim was  filed.1    Essentially,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Thus, where the  taxes sought to be  recovered are deemed\npaid as  of the date the return was due (and no extension for\nfiling the return was granted), a return such as  Oropallo's,\nwhich  itself is the refund claim, must be filed within three\nyears of  its due date for the taxpayer to be able to recover\nany  of the  taxes  paid.    Basically,  for  a  taxpayer  in\nOropallo's  situation,  section  6511(a) and  (b)(2)(A)  work\ntogether  with  section  6513(b)(1)  to  impose  a three-year\nstatute of  limitations on  refund claims, measured  from the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ntherefore,  it establishes  an additional  limitations period\n\nseparate from the three-year period in section 6511(a).  See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Mills v.

Equitable Tolling\n                               \n\n          Oropallo argues that the limitations  period should\n\nbe  tolled   \"[i]n  the  interests  of   justice\"  given  the\n\n\"extremely mitigating and  extenuating circumstances\" of  his\n\ncase.    In  our  opinion,  only  Oropallo's  alleged  carbon\n\nmonoxide poisoning could  qualify for that characterization.2\n\nThe  government  interprets  Oropallo's  argument  to  be  an\n\nattempt to invoke either the mitigation provisions of the tax\n\ncode,  26 U.S.C.      1311-14, or  the  judicial doctrine  of\n\nequitable recoupment.   It correctly points  out that neither\n\nthe  mitigation  provisions  nor  the   equitable  recoupment\n\ndoctrine apply.   In view  of Oropallo's status  as a  pro se\n                                                             \n\npetitioner,  however, we  think we have  an obligation  to go\n\nbeyond the government's  brief and to take  account of recent\n\n                    \n\n2.  We assume that carbon monoxide  poisoning, which Oropallo\nalleges  not only  incapacitated him  for several  years, but\nalso deprived  him of  his ability  to know that  he had  not\nfiled  a  1983  tax  return,  would  be analogous  to  mental\nincapacity and  thus could be a ground  for equitable tolling\nif  Oropallo  could  show  that  his  alleged  poisoning  had\nactually prevented him from filing his 1983 return on time or\nfrom remembering earlier than  1989 that he had not  done so.\nSee  Lopez v.

The other grounds for equitable tolling\nwhich  Oropallo alleges do not  appear to have  caused him to\ndelay filing his return, either  in 1983 or in 1989 after  he\nlearned that his  1983 return had  not been filed.

Although  Lampf  involved   a  lawsuit  between   private\n                   \nparties, it is clearly  relevant here.  As the  Supreme Court\nstated  in  Irwin,  equitable  tolling  principles  in  suits\n                 \nagainst  the  government  should  be  consistent  with  those\napplied  against private  defendants, and should  be employed\n\"no  more  favorabl[y]\" against  the government  than against\nprivate defendants.

It also agreed that, in fraud cases, the\n\nlimitations period  does not usually begin  running until the\n\nfraud is discovered.  Nevertheless,  the Court held that time\n\nlimits,  expressed as  in section 9(e),  were not  subject to\n\nequitable tolling.  In the Court's view, it was \"evident that\n\nthe equitable tolling  doctrine is fundamentally inconsistent\n\nwith the 1-and-3-year structure.\"  Id. at 2782.  It explained\n                                      \n\nwhat it meant as follows:\n\n          The 1-year  period,  by  its  terms,  begins  after\n          discovery of the facts constituting  the violation,\n          making tolling unnecessary.   The 3-year limit is a\n          period of  repose inconsistent with tolling.  . . .\n          \"[T]he inclusion of the  three-year period can have\n          no  significance  in  this  context  other  than to\n          impose  an  outside  limit.\"  (Citations  omitted.)\n          Because the  purpose of  the  3-year limitation  is\n          clearly to serve as a cutoff, we hold that  tolling\n          principles do not apply to that period.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          We  think that  section 6511(a)  and (b)(2)(A)  are\n\nstructured like the 1-and-3-period considered  by the Supreme\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nCourt in Lampf.  Under section 6511, a taxpayer who has filed\n              \n\na return must clear two  time barriers.  The first one  is in\n\nsection 6511(a),  which requires  taxpayers to file  a refund\n\nclaim within three years of filing a return.  We have assumed\n\nthat a return can be filed at any time after its due date and\n\nstill be a return for purposes of  filing a claim within that\n\nthree-year   period.     Under   that   interpretation,   the\n\nlimitations period in  section 6511(a)  is totally  illusory.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Mills  v. United States,  805 F.  Supp. 448, 451\n                                    \n\n(E.D. Tex. 1992) (section 6511(a) would \"permit a taxpayer to\n\nfile a tax  return 40 years late and still  have 3 additional\n\nyears  in which  to  file a  claim  for  refund\").   In  this\n\nrespect,  the   three-year  period  in  section   6511(a)  is\n\nanalogous to  the one-year  period discussed  in Lampf.   The\n                                                      \n\none-year  period requires only that suit  be filed within one\n\nyear  after discovery  of the  facts which  give rise  to the\n\ncause  of action.  Since  the discovery of  those facts could\n\noccur any number of  years after the statutory violation  had\n\nactually taken place, the 1-year period sets no real limit on\n\nwhen suit can be brought.  \n\n          The  analogy  between  the  limitations  period  in\n\nsection  6511(a) and  the 1-year  period typified  by section\n\n9(e)  extends even  further.   In  Lampf,  the Supreme  Court\n                                        \n\ncommented  that the  one-year  period for  filing suit  after\n\ndiscovery of the  facts giving  rise to the  cause of  action\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nmade  tolling unnecessary.  Lampf, 111  S. Ct. at 2782.  What\n                                 \n\nthe  Court obviously meant was that once someone who has been\n\ndefrauded knows  the relevant facts, the  1-year period gives\n\nthat  person ample time in which to  sue and there is no need\n\nto  toll the 1-year limitations  period.  A  similar state of\n\nknowledge respecting the right to a refund can  be attributed\n\nto  individual calendar  year taxpayers  who file  income tax\n\nreturns.   The return contains all  the information necessary\n\nto verify that  there has  been an overpayment  of taxes  and\n\nthat  a refund is due.  Accordingly, the three-year period in\n\nsection 6511(a)  gives  the taxpayer  ample  time to  file  a\n\nrefund claim, and there is no need to toll that period.\n\n          Essentially, then, section 6511(a) serves simply to\n\nidentify which taxpayers have properly  positioned themselves\n\nto  obtain  a  refund.   Like  the  1-year  period in  Lampf,\n                                                            \n\nhowever,  it  does  not  describe which  of  those  potential\n\nclaimants  will actually  succeed  in pursuing  their rights.\n\nThat  task   is  left   to   section  6511(b)(2)(A),   which,\n\nsignificantly,   the  tax   code  characterizes   not   as  a\n\nlimitations period, but as a \"limit on [the] amount of credit\n\nor  refund.\"  See 26  U.S.C.   6511(b)(2)(A)  (caption).7  As\n                 \n\n                    \n\n7.  Section 6511(b)(2)(A) works together with section 6511(a)\nand section 6513(b)(1) to  bar recovery of any refund  claims\non  late returns not filed  within three years  after the due\ndate  of  the return,  and thus  it  clearly operates  like a\nstatute of limitations.  However, Congress's characterization\nof section  6511(b)(2)(A)  as a  \"limit  on [the]  amount  of\ncredit  or  refund\"  rather  than  as  a  limitations  period\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nwe  said  earlier, section  6511(b)(2)(A)  limits  the refund\n\nrecoverable to  the  amount of  tax  paid in  the  three-year\n\nperiod immediately preceding the filing of the claim.  For an\n\nindividual   calendar  year  taxpayer  like  Oropallo,  taxes\n\nwithheld  from wages during the  tax year are  deemed paid on\n\nApril  15th  of the  following year,  the  date when  the tax\n\nreturn is due.  See 26 U.S.C.   6513(b)(1).  For that reason,\n                   \n\nif the  return is not filed and the claim not made within the\n\nthree   years  immediately   following  that   date,  section\n\n6511(b)(2)(A)  precludes the  recovery  of any  of the  taxes\n\npaid. \n\n          Here,  Oropallo's 1983  taxes were  deemed  paid on\n\nApril  15, 1984,  and his  refund claim  was timely  filed on\n\nMarch 19,  1990, the  same day  he filed  his return.   Under\n\nsection 6511(b)(2)(A)  he may recover  any taxes paid  in the\n\nimmediately  preceding three-year period,  i.e., on  or after\n\nMarch  19,  1987.   But all  of the  taxes Oropallo  seeks to\n\nrecover were paid before March 19, 1987, and thus he recovers\n\nnothing.    Unquestionably,  then,  that date  serves  as  an\n\nabsolute  cut-off point.   By imposing an  \"outside limit\" or\n\n\"cut-off\"  on the  amount of  taxes which  can be  recovered,\n\nsection 6511(b)(2)(A) operates like the three-year portion of\n\nthe limitations period  in Lampf,  and thus is  a \"period  of\n                                \n\n                    \n\nindicates more clearly than a simple limitations period would\nthat Congress intended  to establish an outside limit  on the\nrecovery of refunds.  \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nrepose inconsistent with tolling\".

Remaining Claims\n                              \n\n          Oropallo's  remaining claims are  without merit for\n\nthe  reasons stated in the government's brief.  We comment on\n\nseveral claims only.      \n\n          At the  heart of  Oropallo's due process  claims is\n\nthe  contention that  he  should have  been  given a  hearing\n\nbefore his refund  claim was denied  and his suit  dismissed.\n\nThe short answer is that  an administrative hearing would not\n\nhave changed  the outcome for  Oropallo.  The  critical facts\n\nrelating  to  the date  Oropallo's  taxes were  paid  and his\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nrefund claim filed are not disputed.  In view of those facts,\n\nsection  6511 unquestionably bars  Oropallo's recovery of any\n\nportion of his 1983  taxes.  Furthermore, it is  well settled\n\nthat post-collection judicial  review accords a  taxpayer all\n\nthe process that is due under our tax laws.  Martinez v.

Both  this court  and  the district  court  have\n\nreviewed the IRS's denial of Oropallo's refund claim and have\n\nissued opinions  explaining that his claim  is barred because\n\nit was  untimely.   Thus,  Oropallo  has received  the  post-\n\ncollection judicial review to which he was entitled.  Second,\n\nOropallo argues that the  disallowance notice and various IRS\n\npublications   referring  to  a   two-year  period  for  suit\n\nconstituted governmental consent to his suit which waived the\n\ntime bar.

But  section\n\n6532(a)(1) regulates only  the time  for bringing  a suit  to\n\nreview  the denial of an administrative claim.  The Code also\n\nimposes certain administrative requirements respecting refund\n\nclaims  which  Oropallo  was   required  to  follow.

Cal.  1977)  (a  notice  disallowing\n\ntaxpayer's  refund  claim  as  untimely  did  not  waive  the\n\ngovernment's  limitations defense  under  section 6511(a)  by\n\nstating that the  taxpayer had  two years in  which to  bring\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nsuit, but \"merely . . . notif[ied] the Plaintiff of his right\n\nto   contest   the   government's   interpretation   of   the\n\napplicability of the statute of limitations\").\n\n          Finally,  Oropallo claims that his equal protection\n\nrights  have been  violated because  the IRS  can reach  back\n\nfarther in time  to collect taxes  than he  can to collect  a\n\nrefund.  We think that Oropallo would be hard-pressed to show\n\nthat he and the IRS are similarly situated parties in the tax\n\ncollection context  so as  to make equal  protection analysis\n\napplicable.   Cf. Musser v. United States, 92-1 USTC   50,245\n                                         \n\n(D. Alaska 1991) (it is not discriminatory for the government\n\nto have a longer period to sue for recovery  of erroneous tax\n\nrefunds  than a taxpayer is allowed to sue for overpayment of\n\ntaxes  since the IRS deals  with millions of  tax returns per\n\nyear while a  taxpayer typically  has only one  return to  be\n\nconcerned about each  year).  In any  event, we find  no such\n\nviolation here.  As the  government observes, in one  respect\n\nOropallo's claim  is factually wrong.   Just as  the taxpayer\n\nhas three  years from the date  of filing a return  to file a\n\nrefund  claim, so  the  government generally  has only  three\n\nyears  from the date a  return is filed  to make a deficiency\n\nassessment.    See  26 U.S.C.     6501(a).    As our  opinion\n                  \n\nexplains,  however, section  6511(a) and  (b)(2)(A), together\n\nwith section 6513(b)(1), effectively  impose on a taxpayer in\n\nOropallo's  situation  an  additional,   absolute  three-year\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nlimitations period  on refund  claims beginning the  date the\n\nreturn was due.  The government does not appear to be subject\n\nto  that   limitations  period  in   assessing  deficiencies.\n\nNevertheless,  the  apparent  disparate  treatment  does  not\n\nviolate Oropallo's constitutional rights.   It seems  obvious\n\nto  us that,  if  the  government  were  held  to  that  same\n\nadditional limitations  period, any taxpayer could  (and many\n\nmight)  prevent  the   government  from   ever  assessing   a\n\ndeficiency  merely by  waiting to  file a return  until three\n\nyears after its  due date,  an outcome  that would  seriously\n\nundermine the collection of taxes.  \n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n</pre>",
