John Pappalardo,  United States Attorney, Wendy  Warring,\n                                                              \nTrial Attorney,  U.S. Department  of  Justice, New  England  Bank\nFraud  Task Force, and Margaret R.  Hinkle, Director, New England\n                                        \nBank Fraud Task Force, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                        June 10, 1993\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.  On  this appeal from the denial of a motion\n               \n\nunder  28 U.S.C.   2255  filed by petitioner  Frank Buco, the\n\ngovernment has  conceded that an error,  unnoticed by anyone,\n\nwas made in the calculation of the sentencing guideline range\n\nwhen petitioner was originally sentenced.  Buco was convicted\n\nof  bank fraud  and  related offenses  and,  at the  time  of\n\nsentencing in 1991, a total offense level of 19 was computed,\n\nincluding a 3-point upward adjustment for an aggravating role\n\nand  a 2-point upward adjustment  for abuse of  a position of\n\ntrust.  U.S.S.G.    3B.1.1(b),  3B1.3 (1990).   Buco did  not\n\nappeal the sentence.\n\n     Although  the  guidelines  in  effect  at  the  time  of\n\nsentencing  permitted  both  adjustments, the  guidelines  in\n\neffect at the time of the offenses (which apparently ended in\n\n1989) did not.  Compare U.S.S.G.   3B1.3 (1989) with U.S.S.G.\n                                                    \n\n  3B1.3 (1990) (as amended by Amendment 346).  The government\n\nconcedes that the  2-point upward adjustment  for abuse of  a\n\nposition of trust was impermissible  under the Ex Post  Facto\n\nClause.   See Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 429-35 (1987).\n                               \n\nBut  it  also  contends  that  the  issue  was  not  properly\n\npreserved and that, in any event, Buco was not prejudiced.\n\n     The guideline  range computed at the  time of sentencing\n\nwas   30-37  months,   but   departing   downward   (somewhat\n\nreluctantly) to reflect Buco's cooperation  with authorities,\n\nthe district court imposed a 27-month sentence.   The correct\n\nguideline range, based on the government's concession, is 24-\n\n30 months.  The government argues that  the 27-month sentence\n\nwas the  minimum the district  court deemed appropriate.   In\n\nrejecting the government's suggestion of a departure down  to\n\n21 months, the district  court stated that it would  not drop\n\nbelow  27 months  because of  Buco's greater  involvement and\n\nculpability in  comparison to his  codefendants who  received\n\nsentences  of  up  to 24  months.    Buco  contends that  the\n\ndistrict court,  utilizing the correct guideline range, would\n\nhave  imposed  a  21-month  sentence  (the  proper  guideline\n\nminimum less three months for cooperation).  \n\n     Under  United  States v.  Frady,  456  U.S. 152,  164-68\n                                    \n\n(1982),  a procedurally  defaulted  habeas claim  may not  be\n\nreviewed on the merits  unless the petitioner can  show cause\n\nfor  the default as well as actual prejudice from the alleged\n\nviolation.   An  exception  to Frady's  cause plus  prejudice\n                                    \n\nrequirement exists where failure to consider the claim on the\n\nmerits would result in  a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n\nColeman  v. Thompson,  111 S.Ct.  2546, 2564  (1991).    Buco\n                    \n\ncontends that  the probation officer's error  in applying the\n\namended  guidelines  in  Buco's  presentence  report  and the\n\nprosecutor's failure  to identify  the  error are  sufficient\n\ncause for his procedural default.  We do not agree.\n\n     In  order  to establish  \"cause\"  for  the default,  the\n\npetitioner must show that  some \"objective factor external to\n\nthe defense  impeded   [defense] counsel's efforts  to comply\n\nwith .  . . the procedural rule.\"  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S\n                                                    \n\n478,  488 (1986).  Here  the legal error  was discoverable at\n\nthe  time of  sentencing, and  the failure  of  the probation\n\n                             -3-\n\nofficer  and  prosecutor to  discover  the  mistake does  not\n\nexcuse defense counsel's own inadvertence any more than would\n\na trial  court's failure to  recognize error in  its rulings.\n\nThere   was  no  external  impediment  to  defense  counsel's\n\ncompliance  with   the  rule  requiring  that  objections  to\n\nguideline computations be made at or before sentencing.   The\n\nlawyer  either  neglected  to read  the  pertinent  guideline\n\nprovisions  or else did so but missed the significance of the\n\nlimitation in the pre-1990 version of the guidelines.\n\n     It also appears unlikely that the prejudice  requirement\n\ncould be  met.    \"To  show  `prejudice,'  a  defendant  must\n\ndemonstrate  `a  reasonable  probability that,  but  for [the\n\nalleged]  erro[r], the  result of  the proceeding  would have\n\nbeen different.'\"   Sawyer v.  Whitley, 112 S.Ct.  2514, 2532\n                                      \n\n(1992) (concurring  opinion of  Mr. Justice Blackmun).   From\n\nthe remarks made  at sentencing, it seems  to us at  least as\n\nlikely that the present sentence would have been imposed even\n\nif  the correct guideline range had been used as the starting\n\npoint.    However, this  issue need  not be  resolved because\n\nunless  both cause  and prejudice  are shown,  the procedural\n\ndefault  bars the  petition unless  a miscarriage  of justice\n\nwould result.  United  States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d  707, 717-18\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1992), relied upon by  petitioner, involved direct\n\nappeal where the preconditions to habeas relief do not apply.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     The contours of the \"miscarriage of justice\" concept are\n\nnot precisely delimited, and different standards may apply in\n\ndifferent  contexts.    See  United  States  v.  Orlando,  61\n                                                        \n\nU.S.L.W. 4421,  4424 (1993).  But the  Supreme Court's recent\n\ncollateral review  jurisprudence shows  that when a  sentence\n\nfalls  within  the  correct  guideline  range,  there  is  no\n\nmiscarriage of justice even though it is possible that absent\n\na mistake the sentencing court might have imposed a different\n\nsentence.  Sawyer,  112 S.  Ct. at 2518-23.   Without  laying\n                 \n\ndown  a blanket rule, we do not think that this case presents\n\na miscarriage of justice--a  standard more stringent than the\n\nprejudice requirement--and we  therefore affirm the dismissal\n                                               \n\nof the petition.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                     \n\n                             -5-\n",
