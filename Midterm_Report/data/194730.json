The complaint also  named Almonte's subsequent  employer,\nPaine  Webber, Inc.,  (\"Paine Webber\"),  as a  defendant, and\nalleged other securities, RICO, and mail fraud claims against\nAlmonte, Kidder  and Paine Webber.   These additional federal\nclaims  were dismissed  by  the district  court  and are  not\nbefore us on this appeal.  See Cooperativa I, 758 F. Supp. at\n                                            \n64; Cooperativa II, 777 F. Supp. at 157-61.  \n                  \n     In  addition, the  complaint  included  state law  fraud\nclaims  against  all three  defendants.    These claims  were\ndismissed for  want of  pendent jurisdiction  coincident with\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nalleged  that  Almonte,   while  employed   at  Kidder,   had\n\nfraudulently  induced the Coop to purchase shares in the Unit\n\nTrusts  by misrepresenting to the Coop the nature and risk of\n\nthese investments.   As to timeliness,  the complaint alleged\n\nthat,  because Almonte  had  continued  to  misrepresent  the\n\nnature and value of the Unit Trusts from the date of purchase\n\nthrough  July of  1989, the  applicable Puerto  Rico two-year\n\nstatute of limitations had tolled.5\n\n          While the  Coop's  claims were  pending before  the\n\ndistrict court,  the United States Supreme  Court announced a\n\nuniform federal statute of  limitations for all Section 10(b)\n\nand  Rule 10b-5  claims in  Lampf, Pleva,  Lipkind, Prupis  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nPetigrow v. Gilbertson, 111  S. Ct. 2773 (1991).   Lampf held\n                                                        \n\nthat such claims must be brought within one year of discovery\n\nof the facts  which give rise  to the violation, and  no more\n\n                    \n\nthe  dismissal  of  the   federal  securities  claims.    See\n                                                             \nCooperativa II, 777 F. Supp.  at 161.  While our  decision in\n              \nthe instant appeal will result in the  reinstatement of those\nclaims as well,  we reinstate them  without prejudice to  the\ndistrict court's  further consideration of whether  or not it\nshould   hear  and   determine  them  under   pendent  and/or\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\n\n5.  The  parties do  not dispute  that at  the time  the Coop\nfiled  suit, the  applicable statute  of limitations  was the\ntwo-year provision \"borrowed\" from the Puerto Rico Securities\nAct, 10  L.P.R.A.    890(e).   This  two-year limitation  was\nsubject to equitable tolling under the doctrine of fraudulent\nconcealment, which provides that \"the  statute of limitations\napplicable  to  claims under  Section  10(b)  and Rule  10b-5\nbegins to run when an investor, in the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence, discovered  or should have discovered  the alleged\nfraud.\"   General  Builders Supply  Co.  v.

Id. at 2781-82.\n                                                 \n\nThe one-and-three  year limitation announced in  Lampf is not\n                                                      \n\nsubject to tolling.  Id. at  2782.  Because the Coop's claims\n                        \n\nhad  been filed more than  three years after  the purchase of\n\nthe  Unit  Trusts,  the  district court,  relying  on  Lampf,\n                                                            \n\ndismissed  the claims  (hereinafter  \"the first  dismissal\").\n\nCooperativa II, 777 F. Supp. at 155-56.\n              \n\n          Less than two months after the first dismissal, the\n\nCoop's claims were reinstated  by Section 476 of the  Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance  Corporation Improvement Act  of 1991, Pub.\n\nL. No.  102-242, 105  Stat. 2387  (codified as    27A  of the\n\nSecurities  Exchange  Act  of   1934,  15  U.S.C.     78aa-1)\n\n(hereinafter \"Section 27A\").6   Section 27A reinstates claims\n\n                    \n\n6.  Section 27A provides:\n\n     (a)  Effect on pending causes of action\n\n          The  limitation period  for any  private civil\n     action  implied  under  [section  10(b)]  that  was\n     commenced on or before June 19, 1991,  shall be the\n     limitation period provided  by the laws  applicable\n     in  the  jurisdiction,   including  principles   of\n     retroactivity, as  such laws  existed  on June  19,\n     1991.\n\n     (b)  Effect on dismissed causes of action\n\n          Any  private  civil  cause of  action  implied\n     under  [section 10(b)]  that  was  commenced on  or\n     before June 19, 1991--\n\n          (1)   which  was  dismissed   as  time  barred\n     subsequent to June 19, 1991, and \n\n          (2) which  would have been  timely filed under\n     the   limitation  period   provided  by   the  laws\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwhich,  like the Coop's, were  (1) pending at  the time Lampf\n                                                             \n\nwas  decided, and (2)  dismissed as time  barred under Lampf.\n                                                            \n\nPursuant to Section 27A,  the Coop filed a timely  motion for\n\nreinstatement.\n\n          With the Coop's claims before it a second time, the\n\ndistrict  court set  out  to apply  the pre-Lampf  statute of\n                                                 \n\nlimitations, which,  as noted above, was  subject to tolling.\n\nHaving no discovery before it on the issues of timeliness and\n\ntolling, the  district court applied  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)7\n\nto the Coop's motion for reinstatement. \n\n          The  district court  began its application  of Rule\n\n12(b) with a brief analysis of the junk bond market.  Relying\n\nextensively on  articles in the national  press, submitted by\n\n                    \n\n     applicable    in   the    jurisdiction,   including\n     principles of  retroactivity, as such  laws existed\n     on  June 19, 1991, shall be reinstated on motion by\n     the plaintiff not later than 60 days after Dec. 19,\n     1991.\n\n7.  Defendants  argue that  the  district court  applied Rule\n60(b) to the motion  for reinstatement.  Though the  district\ncourt  did refer to  the motion as  a \"Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b)\nmotion for reconsideration,\" Cooperativa III, 799 F. Supp. at\n                                            \n262, it went on to apply a Rule 12(b) standard, \"[l]ooking at\nthe facts in a light most  favorable to [the Coop] and taking\nthem as true, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\"  Id. at 264. \n                                             \n     Nothing  in  the  language  of Section  27A  or  in  its\nlegislative  history  suggests  that  district  courts should\napply Rule  60(b) to  motions  for reinstatement  thereunder.\nRather,   Section   27A  states   that  claims   meeting  its\nrequirements \"shall be reinstated on motion by the plaintiff\"\n                                 \n(emphasis supplied).   The  district court properly  chose to\napply  a  Rule  12(b)  standard  to  the  Coop's  motion  for\nreinstatement, and  we reject defendant's  argument that  the\ncourt applied or should have applied Rule 60(b).\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nneither party, the district  court found that \"it  was public\n\ncommon knowledge within institutional investment circles that\n\n. . . the high yield bonds sold by Drexel were accompanied by\n\nan  equally high risk,\" Cooperativa III, 799 F. Supp. at 264,\n                                       \n\nand  that  \"any   reasonabl[y]  sophisticated   institutional\n\ninvestor should have recognized that it was investing in junk\n\nbonds.\"8  Id. at 266.  The district court concluded that  the\n             \n\nCoop  \"was  under  an  obligation  to  conduct  a  reasonably\n\ndiligent  inquiry from  the  date of  purchase  of [the  Unit\n\nTrusts] and so  the statute  of limitations began  to run  on\n\nthat date.\"  Id.\n                \n\n          As an alternative date  for commencing the  running\n\nof the statute of limitations, the district court found  that\n\nthe stock market crash of October 19, 1987, was sufficient to\n\nput  the Coop  on  notice of  its possible  securities claims\n\nagainst  defendants.  Id. at 265-66.  Again, the court relied\n                         \n\non  national  press reports  submitted  by  neither party  to\n\nsupport its view  that such  notice was within  the realm  of\n\ncommon knowledge.9   \n\n                    \n\n8.  The district court relied upon articles from, inter alia,\n                                                            \nThe  Christian  Science  Monitor,  Barrons,  Forbes, Business\n                                                             \nWeek, Fortune,  and The Los Angeles Times.   Cooperativa III,\n                                                            \n799 F. Supp. at 264 nn. 5, 6.   \n\n9.  Here,  the district  court  relied on  articles from  The\n                                                             \nFinancial  Times,  Reuters,  The  New  York  Times,  and  The\n                                                             \nWashington Post.  Cooperativa III, 799 F.

Accordingly, it dismissed the  Coop's claims a\n\nsecond time (hereinafter \"the second dismissal\").

In  relying  on these  extraneous  materials,  the\n\ndistrict   court  gave   the  parties   neither   notice  nor\n\nopportunity to be heard, nor did it convert the proceeding to\n\none for summary judgment.   Such use of outside  materials is\n\nbeyond the scope of Rule 12(b).\n\n          Nor do  we find that the  district court's reliance\n\non such material  was within the  scope of \"judicial  notice\"\n\nunder  Fed. R. Evid.  201(b).10  Ordinarily,  when a district\n\ncourt  takes  judicial notice  of a  fact  other than  at the\n\nrequest of a party, it  should notify the parties that  it is\n\ndoing so and afford them an  opportunity to be heard.

As noted  above,  the  district court  gave  the\n\nparties no  such opportunity to  be heard.   Accordingly,  we\n\nfind that the district court's use of scattered press reports\n\nto  take judicial notice  of an adjudicative  fact was beyond\n\nthe proper scope of judicial notice.\n\n          Finally, defendants offer an alternative ground for\n\naffirming  the  district  court's  dismissal  of  the  Coop's\n\nclaims, claiming that Section 27A is constitutionally infirm.\n\nFor the reasons persuasively  stated in Anixter v.

This  two-year limitation  was\nsubject to equitable tolling under the doctrine of fraudulent\nconcealment, which provides that \"the  statute of limitations\napplicable  to  claims under  Section  10(b)  and Rule  10b-5\nbegins to run when an investor, in the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence, discovered  or should have discovered  the alleged\nfraud.\"   General  Builders Supply  Co.  v.

Because the Coop's claims\n                        \n\nhad  been filed more than  three years after  the purchase of\n\nthe  Unit  Trusts,  the  district court,  relying  on  Lampf,\n                                                            \n\ndismissed  the claims  (hereinafter  \"the first  dismissal\").\n\nCooperativa II, 777 F.

R. Civ.  P. 12(b)7\n\nto the Coop's motion for reinstatement. \n\n          The  district court  began its application  of Rule\n\n12(b) with a brief analysis of the junk bond market.  Relying\n\nextensively on  articles in the national  press, submitted by\n\n                    \n\n     applicable    in   the    jurisdiction,   including\n     principles of  retroactivity, as such  laws existed\n     on  June 19, 1991, shall be reinstated on motion by\n     the plaintiff not later than 60 days after Dec. 19,\n     1991.\n\n7.  Defendants  argue that  the  district court  applied Rule\n60(b) to the motion  for reinstatement.  Though the  district\ncourt  did refer to  the motion as  a \"Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b)\nmotion for reconsideration,\" Cooperativa III, 799 F. Supp. at\n                                            \n262, it went on to apply a Rule 12(b) standard, \"[l]ooking at\nthe facts in a light most  favorable to [the Coop] and taking\nthem as true, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\"  Id. at 264. \n                                             \n     Nothing  in  the  language  of Section  27A  or  in  its\nlegislative  history  suggests  that  district  courts should\napply Rule  60(b) to  motions  for reinstatement  thereunder.\nRather,   Section   27A  states   that  claims   meeting  its\nrequirements \"shall be reinstated on motion by the plaintiff\"\n                                 \n(emphasis supplied).   The  district court properly  chose to\napply  a  Rule  12(b)  standard  to  the  Coop's  motion  for\nreinstatement, and  we reject defendant's  argument that  the\ncourt applied or should have applied Rule 60(b).\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nneither party, the district  court found that \"it  was public\n\ncommon knowledge within institutional investment circles that\n\n. . . the high yield bonds sold by Drexel were accompanied by\n\nan  equally high risk,\" Cooperativa III, 799 F. Supp. at 264,\n                                       \n\nand  that  \"any   reasonabl[y]  sophisticated   institutional\n\ninvestor should have recognized that it was investing in junk\n\nbonds.\"8  Id. at 266.  The district court concluded that  the\n             \n\nCoop  \"was  under  an  obligation  to  conduct  a  reasonably\n\ndiligent  inquiry from  the  date of  purchase  of [the  Unit\n\nTrusts] and so  the statute  of limitations began  to run  on\n\nthat date.\"  Id.\n                \n\n          As an alternative date  for commencing the  running\n\nof the statute of limitations, the district court found  that\n\nthe stock market crash of October 19, 1987, was sufficient to\n\nput  the Coop  on  notice of  its possible  securities claims\n\nagainst  defendants.  Id. at 265-66.  Again, the court relied\n                         \n\non  national  press reports  submitted  by  neither party  to\n\nsupport its view  that such  notice was within  the realm  of\n\ncommon knowledge.9   \n\n                    \n\n8.  The district court relied upon articles from, inter alia,\n                                                            \nThe  Christian  Science  Monitor,  Barrons,  Forbes, Business\n                                                             \nWeek, Fortune,  and The Los Angeles Times.

Accordingly, it dismissed the  Coop's claims a\n\nsecond time (hereinafter \"the second dismissal\").

For the reasons that follow, we agree.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Under Rule  12(b), \"any consideration  of documents\n\nnot attached to the  complaint, or not expressly incorporated\n\ntherein,  is forbidden,  unless  the  proceeding is  properly\n\nconverted  into one for summary judgment  under [Fed.
