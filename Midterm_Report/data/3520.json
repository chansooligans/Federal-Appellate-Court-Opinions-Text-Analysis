Videla, which denied his application for\n\n9    asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\n10   Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).     In re Shafiqul Islam,\n\n11   No. A093 451 270 (B.I.A. Mar. 31, 2009), aff’g No. A093 451\n\n12   270 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 18, 2007).     We assume the\n\n13   parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts and\n\n14   procedural history in this case.\n\n15       Under the circumstances of this case, we review both\n\n16   the BIA’s and the IJ’s decisions.     See Yan Chen v. Gonzales,\n\n17   417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005).     The applicable standards\n\n18   of review are well-established.     See 8 U.S.C.\n\n19   § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also Corovic v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 90,\n\n20   95 (2d Cir. 2008).\n\n21       Substantial evidence supports the agency’s adverse\n\n22   credibility determination. See Corovic, 519 F.3d at 95.\n\n23   That determination was based on: (1) Islam’s demeanor; (2)\n\n                                  2\n\f1    internal inconsistencies in Islam’s testimony regarding\n\n2    where an alleged 2005 beating took place, when he resumed\n\n3    his political activities upon his return to Bangladesh, and\n\n4    why he failed to report his kidnaping to authorities; (3)\n\n5    the omission from Islam’s asylum application of any\n\n6    assertion that his alleged persecutors ordered him to end\n\n7    his membership in the Awami Youth League; and (4) Islam’s\n\n8    failure to offer available corroboration.   See 8 U.S.C.\n\n9    § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162,\n\n10   167 (2d Cir. 2008). Moreover, the agency did not err in\n\n11   declining to credit the explanations Islam offered for these\n\n12   discrepancies.   Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d.\n\n13   Cir. 2005).\n\n14       Because the only evidence of a threat to Islam’s life\n\n15   or freedom depended on his credibility, the agency’s adverse\n\n16   credibility determination was fatal to his application for\n\n17   asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.   See Paul v.\n\n18   Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006); Wu Biao Chen v.\n\n19   INS, 344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n20       For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\n21   DENIED.   As we have completed our review, any stay of\n\n22   removal that the Court previously granted in this petition\n\n\n\n                                   3\n\f1   is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in\n\n2   this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for\n\n3   oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with\n\n4   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second\n\n5   Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).\n\n6                                 FOR THE COURT:\n7                                 Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n8\n9\n\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\f",
