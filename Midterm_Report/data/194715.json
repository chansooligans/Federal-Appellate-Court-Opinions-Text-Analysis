Finding  error\n\nin the district court's decision, we reverse.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      Factual Background\n                                        \n\n          During  the latter half  of the 1980's,  Gilbane, a\n\ngeneral contractor,  entered into thirteen  subcontracts with\n\nThames Valley  Steel Corporation (\"TVS\"),  a structural steel\n\nsubcontractor, under which  TVS agreed to  perform structural\n\nsteel  work  for  Gilbane on  thirteen  separate construction\n\nprojects in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  On each project,\n\nCU  acted as  surety for  TVS,  issuing various  performance,\n\nlabor, and material bonds guarantying TVS's proper completion\n\nof  its  obligations.     As  such,  each  of  the   thirteen\n\nconstruction  projects   was  governed  by   at  least  three\n\ncontracts: (1)  the prime  contract between  Gilbane and  the\n\nindividual  owner; (2)  the subcontract  between  Gilbane and\n\nTVS; and (3) CU's performance bond. \n\n          In  1990, TVS  ceased  doing  business  and,  as  a\n\nresult,  defaulted on  its  obligations  under  each  of  the\n\nthirteen  subcontracts.  Disputes  then arose between  CU and\n\nGilbane  concerning CU's obligations as the guarantor of TVS'\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nperformance  on  these projects.    On  August  16, 1991,  CU\n\ncommenced this diversity action against Gilbane alleging that\n\nGilbane wrongfully  withheld  contract balances  owed  CU  in\n\nconnection   with  the   completion   of  the   first  twelve\n\nconstruction  projects.  In  its answer, Gilbane  denied CU's\n\nallegations  and also brought  a two-count counterclaim.   In\n\nCount  I  of  its  counterclaim,  Gilbane  alleged  that,  in\n\nrelation to the thirteenth construction project, TVS breached\n\nthe terms of its subcontract by failing to perform in  a good\n\nand workmanlike manner, and that CU breached the terms of its\n\nperformance bond by  failing to correct TVS' work.   In Count\n\nII,  Gilbane charged that  CU committed unfair  and deceptive\n\ntrade practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A,\n\n   2 and 11 (West  1984 and Supp. 1992) (hereinafter referred\n\nto   simply  as  \"ch.  93A\"),  and  unfair  claim  settlement\n\npractices in  violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  176D,  \n\n3(9) (West 1987 and Supp.  1992), by failing \"to effectuate a\n\nprompt, fair and equitable settlement of Gilbane's claims . .\n\n. .\"\n\n          In response to Gilbane's  counterclaim, CU filed  a\n\nreply denying any liability in connection with the thirteenth\n\nproject and  amended its  complaint to  add a  count alleging\n\nthat Gilbane committed  unfair and deceptive trade  practices\n\nin  violation of ch. 93A  by withholding an undisputed amount\n\n\"solely in order  to gain leverage with respect  to a dispute\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\narising in  connection with  a different project.\"   At  that\n\ntime,  CU also  filed  a  third-party  complaint  against  L.\n\nAntonelli  Iron Works and  The Thompson and  Lichter Company,\n\nInc., both of whom had  entered into subcontracts with TVS to\n\nperform  certain services  in connection with  the thirteenth\n\nconstruction project.  In that complaint, CU alleged that the\n\nthird-party  defendants were  liable to  CU  for any  amounts\n\nGilbane  might  recover  against   CU  on  Count  I  of   its\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n          On November 6, 1991, CU filed the instant motion to\n\nstay Gilbane's counterclaim pending arbitration, arguing that\n\nthe  counterclaim  was  subject  to  an  express  arbitration\n\nagreement.1  Gilbane  opposed the motion to  stay, contending\n\nthat  the  counterclaim  was not  subject  to  an arbitration\n\nagreement, and  in the  alternative, that  CU had waived  its\n\nright to arbitrate by filing the instant lawsuit.  On May 18,\n\n1992, the  district court entered a margin order denying CU's\n\nmotion to stay.  CU appeals from that decision.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                    \n\n1.  We think  it important to  emphasize that Count I  of the\ncounterclaim  concerns   only  the   thirteenth  construction\nproject.  The other twelve  projects, which are the basis for\nthe complaint  by CU against  Gilbane, are not  implicated in\nthe counterclaim.  The counterclaim, therefore, can be viewed\nas separate  and distinct from  the complaint  brought by  CU\nagainst  Gilbane.   Neither  party  has  suggested  that  the\ndispute as to  the twelve other construction  projects, which\nform   the  basis  for   CU's  complaint,  be   submitted  to\narbitration.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          Although  not  raised  by  the  parties,  we  first\n\nexplain the  basis of our appellate jurisdiction.   Section 3\n\nof the Federal  Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") contains  a procedure\n\nby  which parties  to  an arbitration  agreement  may file  a\n\nmotion  to  stay  the  trial  of  arbitrable  claims  pending\n\narbitration.   See 9 U.S.C.A.    3 (West 1970).   Pursuant to\n                  \n\nthat section of the statute,  a district court must grant the\n\nstay \"upon  being satisfied that the issue  involved . . . is\n\nreferable to  arbitration under  such an agreement  . .  . .\"\n\nThe FAA further provides that  \"[a]n appeal may be taken from\n\n. . . an order . . . refusing a stay under  section 3 of this\n\ntitle .  . . .\"  9 U.S.C.A.    16(a)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1992).\n\nAs CU is  appealing from a denial  of a motion to  stay under\n\nsection  3   of  the   FAA,  we   therefore  have   appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\nA.  Arbitrability\n                 \n\n          The  arbitrability of  this  dispute turns  on  the\n\ninterpretation  of contractual terms, a question of law which\n\nwe can determine  in the first instance.   See, e.g., Fashion\n                                                             \n\nHouse, Inc. v.  K Mart Corp., 892  F.2d 1076, 1083  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1989).\n\n1.  Relevant Contract Language\n                              \n\n          Gilbane's counterclaim is  based upon CU's  alleged\n\nbreach  of its  performance bond  on  the thirteenth  project\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n(\"the  Performance Bond\").   Thus, the arbitrability  of this\n\ncounterclaim depends upon  whether there is language  in that\n\ncontract  subjecting  disputes  between  Gilbane  and  CU  to\n\narbitration.  \n\n          Although  the  Performance  Bond  has  no  language\n\ndealing   with  arbitration,   it  does   contain   a  clause\n\nincorporating the  subcontract between Gilbane and  TVS (\"the\n\nSubcontract\"), which, in turn, has a clause incorporating the\n\nprime  contract  between   Gilbane  and  the  owner   of  the\n\nthirteenth project (\"the  Prime Contract\").  It is  the Prime\n\nContract that contains  the arbitration clause.   That clause\n\nreads as follows:\n\n               All  claims,   disputes  and   other\n          matters in  question arising  out of,  or\n          relating to this Agreement or the  breach\n          thereof,  .  .  .  shall  be  decided  by\n          arbitration   in   accordance   with  the\n          Construction  Industry Arbitration  Rules\n          of the  American Arbitration  Association\n          then   obtaining   unless   the   parties\n          mutually agree otherwise.  This agreement\n          to   arbitrate   shall   be  specifically\n          enforceable    under    the    prevailing\n          arbitration law by a three-member panel.\n\n          The  Subcontract,  which  was  drafted by  Gilbane,\n\ncontains a  clause  incorporating certain  provisions of  the\n\nPrime Contract:\n\n               [Gilbane] shall be bound to [TVS] by\n          the  terms of  this  agre[e]ment, to  the\n          extent   that  the   provisions  of   the\n          contract documents between  the owner and\n          [Gilbane] apply  to the work of  [TVS] as\n          defined in  this agreement[.]   [Gilbane]\n          shall   assume  toward   [TVS]  all   the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          obligations and responsibilities that the\n          owner, by those documents, assumes toward\n          [Gilbane].    [Gilbane]  shall  have  the\n          benefit  of  all  rights,  remedies,  and\n          redress against [TVS] which the owner, by\n          those documents, has against [Gilbane]. .\n          . .2\n\n          Finally,  the   Performance  Bond   has  a   clause\n\nincorporating the  Subcontract by reference:  \"Whereas, [TVS]\n\nhas by written  agreement . . . entered  into a [S]ubcontract\n\nwith [Gilbane] . . . which [S]ubcontract is by reference made\n\na part hereof . . . .\"\n\n2.  Relevant Law\n                \n\n          In  deciding  whether  a  chain  of   incorporation\n\nrendering  Gilbane's  counterclaim arbitrable  exists  within\n\nthese three contracts,  we are mindful of  the strong federal\n\npolicy  favoring  arbitration  agreements,  a  policy   which\n\nrequires us to resolve  \"any doubts\" concerning arbitrability\n\nin favor of arbitration.  See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v.\n                                                          \n\nMercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983).   See also J\n                                                             \n\n&amp; S  Constr. Co., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 520 F.2d 809,\n                                              \n\n810 (1st Cir.  1975) (construing incorporation language  in a\n\nsubcontract  broadly  in  light   of  \"the  policy   favoring\n\narbitration\").  This  policy applies \"whether the  problem at\n\nhand is the  construction of the contract  language itself or\n\n                    \n\n2.  The subcontract  defines \"contract documents\"  to include\n\"the  agreement  between   the  owner   and  [Gilbane],   the\nconditions  of the agreement between the owner and [Gilbane],\ngeneral   conditions,   supplementary,  special   and   other\nconditions . . . .\"\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nan  allegation  of  waiver,  delay,  or  a  like  defense  to\n\narbitrability.\"  Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 25.\n                              \n\n          In a  remarkably  similar case,  the Sixth  Circuit\n\nheld that  a chain of  incorporation running through  a prime\n\ncontract,  a  subcontract, and  a  performance bond  rendered\n\ndisputes  under the  performance bond  subject  to the  prime\n\ncontract's arbitration  clause.   Exchange Mut.  Ins. Co.  v.\n                                                         \n\nHaskell Co., 742 F.2d 274, 275-76  (6th Cir. 1984).  Like the\n           \n\nPerformance Bond at issue here, the bond in that case did not\n\nitself  contain an arbitration  clause.  Rather,  the bond in\n\nHaskell incorporated the subcontract by reference, (employing\n       \n\nincorporation  language  almost  identical  to that  involved\n\nhere), which,  in turn,  incorporated the  prime contract  by\n\nreference.  Id.  The incorporation clause in that subcontract\n               \n\nread  as follows:   \"Subcontractor  hereby  assumes the  same\n\nobligations   and  responsibilities   with  respect   to  his\n\nperformance under  this Subcontract, that  Contractor assumes\n\ntowards Owner with respect to his  performance on the [prime]\n\n[c]ontract.\"   Id.  at 275.   The  prime contract  in Haskell\n                                                             \n\ncontained an arbitration provision  almost identical to  that\n\nin the Prime Contract at issue here.  Id.  \n                                         \n\n          Without reference  to the federal  policy requiring\n\nit  to construe  any  doubts in  favor of  arbitrability, the\n\nSixth Circuit  nevertheless reasoned  that the  incorporation\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nlanguage  in the performance  bond and subcontract  was broad\n\nenough to include the prime contract's arbitration agreement:\n\n               Here,    the    performance     bond\n          specifically referred to and incorporated\n          the   subcontract.      The   subcontract\n          provides  that the  same obligations  and\n          responsibilities apply in the subcontract\n          as apply in  the [prime] contract.   And,\n          finally,  the  [prime]  contract provides\n          that there is a duty to arbitrate.  Thus,\n          the  performance  bond   incorporates  by\n          reference     the     subcontract,    the\n          subcontract incorporates by reference the\n          [prime] contract[,] and hence[,] the duty\n          to arbitrate.\n\nId. at 276 (relying on J &amp; S Constr., 520 F.2d at 810).\n                                    \n\n          If  anything,  the  language  in  the   Subcontract\n\nincorporating the terms of the Prime Contract is even broader\n\nthan  that in  the  Haskell  subcontract.    The  Subcontract\n                           \n\nprovides that, to the extent the Prime Contract (with all its\n\nattendant conditions)  applies to  the work  of TVS,  Gilbane\n\n\"shall   assume   toward  [TVS]   all  the   obligations  and\n                                     \n\nresponsibilities\" that the owner assumed toward Gilbane under\n\nthe  Prime  Contract.   (Emphasis  added).    The Subcontract\n\nfurther  states that \"[Gilbane] shall have the benefit of all\n\nrights,  remedies, and redress against [TVS] which the owner,\n\nby [the  contract documents],  has against  [Gilbane].\"   The\n\nparties  do not  dispute that  one of  the obligations  which\n\nGilbane assumed toward the owner under the Prime Contract was\n\nto  submit  all disputes  arising  out  of  the  contract  to\n\narbitration.  Nor do they dispute that the bundle of \"rights,\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nremedies,  and redress\"  given  the  owner  under  the  Prime\n\nContract included the right to  submit all claims relating to\n\nthat contract to arbitration.  Accordingly, we find that  the\n\nSubcontract bound  Gilbane to arbitrate  disputes relating to\n\nthe work  of TVS.3   Because the Performance  Bond explicitly\n\nincorporated  by reference the  terms of the  Subcontract, we\n\nfurther find that  Gilbane and CU similarly  bound themselves\n\nto  submit disputes  arising under  the  Performance Bond  to\n\n                    \n\n3.  In  support of  its contention  that the language  in the\nSubcontract  should be read  narrowly, Gilbane points  to the\nclause  in that  contract  expressly  granting  Gilbane  \"the\nbenefits of all  rights, remedies, and redress  against [TVS]\nwhich  the  owner,  by  [the  Prime  Contract],  has  against\n[Gilbane].\"    Because  the Subcontract  does  not  contain a\nparallel  clause expressly granting  TVS \"the benefit  of all\nrights,  remedies,  and redress\"  under  the Prime  Contract,\nGilbane contends that  the parties did not intend  for TVS to\nhave the same right  to subject disputes under this  contract\nto arbitration.  We do not agree.\n     First, this argument  ignores the immediately  preceding\nclause which states  that Gilbane \"shall assume  toward [TVS]\nall the obligations  and responsibilities that the  owner, by\n[the Prime Contract],  has against [Gilbane].\"   As explained\nabove, we  interpret this clause  to impose upon  Gilbane the\nduty  to arbitrate  \"all  disputes  relating  to  [the  Prime\nContract],\"  an obligation  assumed by  the  owner under  the\nPrime Contract.   Second, adopting Gilbane's  cramped reading\nof this language would run  counter to the clearly enunciated\nfederal policy  of interpreting  \"any doubts\"  in contractual\nlanguage in favor of arbitration.

See,\n                                                            \ne.g., LFC Lessors,  Inc. v.

To  the  extent that  the  district  court held\n\notherwise, we reverse.4\n\nB.  Waiver\n          \n\n          Gilbane alternatively  contends that,  even if  the\n\ncounterclaim  is arbitrable, CU waived its right to arbitrate\n\nthat  claim based  upon its  pretrial  participation in  this\n\nlawsuit.  This contention we find meritless.\n\n          In  deciding  this  issue,  we  first  discuss  the\n\nappropriate  standard of  review.    As  the  district  court\n\ndecided the arbitrability  question by margin order,  we have\n\nno  predicate factual  findings to  review.   In fact,  it is\n\npossible that the  district court did not  reach the question\n\nof waiver but decided against  CU solely on the basis of  its\n\n                    \n\n4.  To support its position that the district court's refusal\nto grant the  stay was correct, Gilbane relies  upon a series\nof cases which,  it asserts, stand  for the proposition  that\nprime  contract provisions  unrelated  to  the  work  of  the\nsubcontractor  are  not  incorporated  by  reference  into  a\nsubcontract.   See Washington  Metro. Area  Transit Auth.  v.\n                                                         \nNorair Eng'g  Corp., 553 F.2d  233, 235-36 (D.C.  Cir. 1977);\n                   \nJohn W.

None of these\n   \ncases, however, involved the  incorporation of an arbitration\nclause.  Indeed, in  one of the cases relied upon by Gilbane,\nthe   court   explicitly    distinguished   cases   involving\narbitration clauses  as invoking the  \"congressional policies\nfavoring arbitration  . .  . .\"   See Washington  Metro., 553\n                                                        \nF.2d at 236.  In  light of Haskell, a case on all  fours with\n                                  \nthis one, we find Gilbane's  reliance upon this line of cases\nunpersuasive. \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ninterpretation  of the contractual  language.  In  any event,\n\nthe  facts  concerning  CU's  pretrial participation  in  the\n\nlawsuit are undisputed.  As  a result, the question of waiver\n\nis one  of  law, and  we review  it  de novo.

We discuss these contentions in\n\nturn.  \n\n          Gilbane first argues that it would suffer prejudice\n\nfrom  having to  defend  against Count  I  of CU's  complaint\n\nwithout its  counterclaim.   Accepting this contention  would\n\nrequire, in essence, a finding that the thirteen construction\n\nprojects are factually inseparable.   This is simply not  the\n\ncase.   Suppose, for instance, that the counterclaim proceeds\n\nto arbitration  and is  decided in Gilbane's  favor.   Assume\n\nfurther that  the underlying lawsuit  results in an  award to\n\nCU.  Under that scenario,  the arbitration award could act as\n\na stipulated  setoff from the  amount awarded CU  in district\n\ncourt.5    We are  unable  to  imagine  a scenario  in  which\n\nGilbane would suffer  prejudice from having to defend Count I\n\nof  CU's  complaint  in the  underlying  lawsuit  without its\n\ncounterclaim.   Nor has  Gilbane outlined  such a  scenario.6\n\n                    \n\n5.  We note that  Gilbane's attorney conceded as  much during\noral argument.\n\n6.  Gilbane  also  argues   that,  because  it   pleaded  the\nsubstance  of its counterclaim  as an affirmative  defense in\nits  answer  to  the  complaint, it  should  be  permitted to\nlitigate  the substance  of  that  claim  in  the  underlying\naction.  Whether  we characterize the substance  of Gilbane's\nclaim as  a \"counterclaim\"  or a  \"setoff defense,\"  however,\nmakes no difference  for the purposes of  determining whether\nGilbane  will theoretically be prejudiced by severing it from\n                                         \nthe  underlying lawsuit.  Second, and more important, Gilbane\nis, in our opinion, relying upon creative pleading to make an\nend run around an arbitration  agreement.  We have previously\nrejected a  party's reliance upon procedural  gamesmanship to\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nWe therefore  find unpersuasive  its belated  contention that\n\none might exist.\n\n          Gilbane also asserts that it would suffer prejudice\n\nby  having  to defend  against  Count  II of  CU's  complaint\n\nwithout  its  counterclaim.   Again,  Gilbane  has  failed to\n\nprovide an example of how it might be prejudiced.  It appears\n                         \n\nto  be  arguing,   instead,  that  it  would   be  judicially\n\ninefficient to litigate  CU's ch. 93A claim in  one forum and\n\nGilbane's ch.  93A claim in  another.7  While Gilbane  may be\n\ncorrect,   we  fail  to   see  how  any   resulting  judicial\n\ninefficiency would prejudice  Gilbane.8   Cf.  Page, 806 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\navoid the  dictates of an arbitration agreement.   Cf. Hilti,\n                                                             \nInc. v.

We do so again today.\n\n7.  At one point  in its brief, Gilbane states  that it would\n\"be at risk  of inconsistent verdicts .  . . .\"   Gilbane has\nnot,   however,  offered   either  an  explanation   of  this\nperfunctory assertion or an example of a scenario in which it\ncould occur.   As such,  we do not  address it further.   See\n                                                             \nUnited States v.

In  any event, considerations  of judicial efficiency are\nnot  a  sufficient  basis on  which  to  affirm  the district\ncourt's denial  of the  motion to stay.   See,  e.g., Seguros\n                                                             \nBanvenez, S.A. v.

On each project,\n\nCU  acted as  surety for  TVS,  issuing various  performance,\n\nlabor, and material bonds guarantying TVS's proper completion\n\nof  its  obligations.     As  such,  each  of  the   thirteen\n\nconstruction  projects   was  governed  by   at  least  three\n\ncontracts: (1)  the prime  contract between  Gilbane and  the\n\nindividual  owner; (2)  the subcontract  between  Gilbane and\n\nTVS; and (3) CU's performance bond. \n\n          In  1990, TVS  ceased  doing  business  and,  as  a\n\nresult,  defaulted on  its  obligations  under  each  of  the\n\nthirteen  subcontracts.  Disputes  then arose between  CU and\n\nGilbane  concerning CU's obligations as the guarantor of TVS'\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nperformance  on  these projects.    On  August  16, 1991,  CU\n\ncommenced this diversity action against Gilbane alleging that\n\nGilbane wrongfully  withheld  contract balances  owed  CU  in\n\nconnection   with  the   completion   of  the   first  twelve\n\nconstruction  projects.  In  its answer, Gilbane  denied CU's\n\nallegations  and also brought  a two-count counterclaim.   In\n\nCount  I  of  its  counterclaim,  Gilbane  alleged  that,  in\n\nrelation to the thirteenth construction project, TVS breached\n\nthe terms of its subcontract by failing to perform in  a good\n\nand workmanlike manner, and that CU breached the terms of its\n\nperformance bond by  failing to correct TVS' work.   In Count\n\nII,  Gilbane charged that  CU committed unfair  and deceptive\n\ntrade practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A,\n\n   2 and 11 (West  1984 and Supp. 1992) (hereinafter referred\n\nto   simply  as  \"ch.  93A\"),  and  unfair  claim  settlement\n\npractices in  violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  176D,  \n\n3(9) (West 1987 and Supp.  1992), by failing \"to effectuate a\n\nprompt, fair and equitable settlement of Gilbane's claims . .\n\n. .\"\n\n          In response to Gilbane's  counterclaim, CU filed  a\n\nreply denying any liability in connection with the thirteenth\n\nproject and  amended its  complaint to  add a  count alleging\n\nthat Gilbane committed  unfair and deceptive trade  practices\n\nin  violation of ch. 93A  by withholding an undisputed amount\n\n\"solely in order  to gain leverage with respect  to a dispute\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\narising in  connection with  a different project.\"   At  that\n\ntime,  CU also  filed  a  third-party  complaint  against  L.\n\nAntonelli  Iron Works and  The Thompson and  Lichter Company,\n\nInc., both of whom had  entered into subcontracts with TVS to\n\nperform  certain services  in connection with  the thirteenth\n\nconstruction project.  In that complaint, CU alleged that the\n\nthird-party  defendants were  liable to  CU  for any  amounts\n\nGilbane  might  recover  against   CU  on  Count  I  of   its\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n          On November 6, 1991, CU filed the instant motion to\n\nstay Gilbane's counterclaim pending arbitration, arguing that\n\nthe  counterclaim  was  subject  to  an  express  arbitration\n\nagreement.1  Gilbane  opposed the motion to  stay, contending\n\nthat  the  counterclaim  was not  subject  to  an arbitration\n\nagreement, and  in the  alternative, that  CU had waived  its\n\nright to arbitrate by filing the instant lawsuit.  On May 18,\n\n1992, the  district court entered a margin order denying CU's\n\nmotion to stay.  CU appeals from that decision.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                    \n\n1.  We think  it important to  emphasize that Count I  of the\ncounterclaim  concerns   only  the   thirteenth  construction\nproject.  The other twelve  projects, which are the basis for\nthe complaint  by CU against  Gilbane, are not  implicated in\nthe counterclaim.  The counterclaim, therefore, can be viewed\nas separate  and distinct from  the complaint  brought by  CU\nagainst  Gilbane.   Neither  party  has  suggested  that  the\ndispute as to  the twelve other construction  projects, which\nform   the  basis  for   CU's  complaint,  be   submitted  to\narbitration.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          Although  not  raised  by  the  parties,  we  first\n\nexplain the  basis of our appellate jurisdiction.   Section 3\n\nof the Federal  Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") contains  a procedure\n\nby  which parties  to  an arbitration  agreement  may file  a\n\nmotion  to  stay  the  trial  of  arbitrable  claims  pending\n\narbitration.   See 9 U.S.C.A.    3 (West 1970).   Pursuant to\n                  \n\nthat section of the statute,  a district court must grant the\n\nstay \"upon  being satisfied that the issue  involved . . . is\n\nreferable to  arbitration under  such an agreement  . .  . .\"\n\nThe FAA further provides that  \"[a]n appeal may be taken from\n\n. . . an order . . . refusing a stay under  section 3 of this\n\ntitle .  . . .\"  9 U.S.C.A.    16(a)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1992).\n\nAs CU is  appealing from a denial  of a motion to  stay under\n\nsection  3   of  the   FAA,  we   therefore  have   appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\nA.  Arbitrability\n                 \n\n          The  arbitrability of  this  dispute turns  on  the\n\ninterpretation  of contractual terms, a question of law which\n\nwe can determine  in the first instance.   See, e.g., Fashion\n                                                             \n\nHouse, Inc. v.

Relevant Contract Language\n                              \n\n          Gilbane's counterclaim is  based upon CU's  alleged\n\nbreach  of its  performance bond  on  the thirteenth  project\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n(\"the  Performance Bond\").   Thus, the arbitrability  of this\n\ncounterclaim depends upon  whether there is language  in that\n\ncontract  subjecting  disputes  between  Gilbane  and  CU  to\n\narbitration.  \n\n          Although  the  Performance  Bond  has  no  language\n\ndealing   with  arbitration,   it  does   contain   a  clause\n\nincorporating the  subcontract between Gilbane and  TVS (\"the\n\nSubcontract\"), which, in turn, has a clause incorporating the\n\nprime  contract  between   Gilbane  and  the  owner   of  the\n\nthirteenth project (\"the  Prime Contract\").  It is  the Prime\n\nContract that contains  the arbitration clause.   That clause\n\nreads as follows:\n\n               All  claims,   disputes  and   other\n          matters in  question arising  out of,  or\n          relating to this Agreement or the  breach\n          thereof,  .  .  .  shall  be  decided  by\n          arbitration   in   accordance   with  the\n          Construction  Industry Arbitration  Rules\n          of the  American Arbitration  Association\n          then   obtaining   unless   the   parties\n          mutually agree otherwise.  This agreement\n          to   arbitrate   shall   be  specifically\n          enforceable    under    the    prevailing\n          arbitration law by a three-member panel.\n\n          The  Subcontract,  which  was  drafted by  Gilbane,\n\ncontains a  clause  incorporating certain  provisions of  the\n\nPrime Contract:\n\n               [Gilbane] shall be bound to [TVS] by\n          the  terms of  this  agre[e]ment, to  the\n          extent   that  the   provisions  of   the\n          contract documents between  the owner and\n          [Gilbane] apply  to the work of  [TVS] as\n          defined in  this agreement[.]   [Gilbane]\n          shall   assume  toward   [TVS]  all   the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          obligations and responsibilities that the\n          owner, by those documents, assumes toward\n          [Gilbane].    [Gilbane]  shall  have  the\n          benefit  of  all  rights,  remedies,  and\n          redress against [TVS] which the owner, by\n          those documents, has against [Gilbane]. .\n          . .2\n\n          Finally,  the   Performance  Bond   has  a   clause\n\nincorporating the  Subcontract by reference:  \"Whereas, [TVS]\n\nhas by written  agreement . . . entered  into a [S]ubcontract\n\nwith [Gilbane] . . . which [S]ubcontract is by reference made\n\na part hereof . . . .\"\n\n2.  Relevant Law\n                \n\n          In  deciding  whether  a  chain  of   incorporation\n\nrendering  Gilbane's  counterclaim arbitrable  exists  within\n\nthese three contracts,  we are mindful of  the strong federal\n\npolicy  favoring  arbitration  agreements,  a  policy   which\n\nrequires us to resolve  \"any doubts\" concerning arbitrability\n\nin favor of arbitration.

Like the\n           \n\nPerformance Bond at issue here, the bond in that case did not\n\nitself  contain an arbitration  clause.  Rather,  the bond in\n\nHaskell incorporated the subcontract by reference, (employing\n       \n\nincorporation  language  almost  identical  to that  involved\n\nhere), which,  in turn,  incorporated the  prime contract  by\n\nreference.  Id.  The incorporation clause in that subcontract\n               \n\nread  as follows:   \"Subcontractor  hereby  assumes the  same\n\nobligations   and  responsibilities   with  respect   to  his\n\nperformance under  this Subcontract, that  Contractor assumes\n\ntowards Owner with respect to his  performance on the [prime]\n\n[c]ontract.\"   Id.  at 275.   The  prime contract  in Haskell\n                                                             \n\ncontained an arbitration provision  almost identical to  that\n\nin the Prime Contract at issue here.  Id.  \n                                         \n\n          Without reference  to the federal  policy requiring\n\nit  to construe  any  doubts in  favor of  arbitrability, the\n\nSixth Circuit  nevertheless reasoned  that the  incorporation\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nlanguage  in the performance  bond and subcontract  was broad\n\nenough to include the prime contract's arbitration agreement:\n\n               Here,    the    performance     bond\n          specifically referred to and incorporated\n          the   subcontract.      The   subcontract\n          provides  that the  same obligations  and\n          responsibilities apply in the subcontract\n          as apply in  the [prime] contract.   And,\n          finally,  the  [prime]  contract provides\n          that there is a duty to arbitrate.  Thus,\n          the  performance  bond   incorporates  by\n          reference     the     subcontract,    the\n          subcontract incorporates by reference the\n          [prime] contract[,] and hence[,] the duty\n          to arbitrate.\n\nId. at 276 (relying on J &amp; S Constr., 520 F.2d at 810).\n                                    \n\n          If  anything,  the  language  in  the   Subcontract\n\nincorporating the terms of the Prime Contract is even broader\n\nthan  that in  the  Haskell  subcontract.    The  Subcontract\n                           \n\nprovides that, to the extent the Prime Contract (with all its\n\nattendant conditions)  applies to  the work  of TVS,  Gilbane\n\n\"shall   assume   toward  [TVS]   all  the   obligations  and\n                                     \n\nresponsibilities\" that the owner assumed toward Gilbane under\n\nthe  Prime  Contract.   (Emphasis  added).    The Subcontract\n\nfurther  states that \"[Gilbane] shall have the benefit of all\n\nrights,  remedies, and redress against [TVS] which the owner,\n\nby [the  contract documents],  has against  [Gilbane].\"   The\n\nparties  do not  dispute that  one of  the obligations  which\n\nGilbane assumed toward the owner under the Prime Contract was\n\nto  submit  all disputes  arising  out  of  the  contract  to\n\narbitration.  Nor do they dispute that the bundle of \"rights,\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nremedies,  and redress\"  given  the  owner  under  the  Prime\n\nContract included the right to  submit all claims relating to\n\nthat contract to arbitration.  Accordingly, we find that  the\n\nSubcontract bound  Gilbane to arbitrate  disputes relating to\n\nthe work  of TVS.3   Because the Performance  Bond explicitly\n\nincorporated  by reference the  terms of the  Subcontract, we\n\nfurther find that  Gilbane and CU similarly  bound themselves\n\nto  submit disputes  arising under  the  Performance Bond  to\n\n                    \n\n3.  In  support of  its contention  that the language  in the\nSubcontract  should be read  narrowly, Gilbane points  to the\nclause  in that  contract  expressly  granting  Gilbane  \"the\nbenefits of all  rights, remedies, and redress  against [TVS]\nwhich  the  owner,  by  [the  Prime  Contract],  has  against\n[Gilbane].\"    Because  the Subcontract  does  not  contain a\nparallel  clause expressly granting  TVS \"the benefit  of all\nrights,  remedies,  and redress\"  under  the Prime  Contract,\nGilbane contends that  the parties did not intend  for TVS to\nhave the same right  to subject disputes under this  contract\nto arbitration.  We do not agree.\n     First, this argument  ignores the immediately  preceding\nclause which states  that Gilbane \"shall assume  toward [TVS]\nall the obligations  and responsibilities that the  owner, by\n[the Prime Contract],  has against [Gilbane].\"   As explained\nabove, we  interpret this clause  to impose upon  Gilbane the\nduty  to arbitrate  \"all  disputes  relating  to  [the  Prime\nContract],\"  an obligation  assumed by  the  owner under  the\nPrime Contract.   Second, adopting Gilbane's  cramped reading\nof this language would run  counter to the clearly enunciated\nfederal policy  of interpreting  \"any doubts\"  in contractual\nlanguage in favor of arbitration.

To  the  extent that  the  district  court held\n\notherwise, we reverse.4\n\nB.  Waiver\n          \n\n          Gilbane alternatively  contends that,  even if  the\n\ncounterclaim  is arbitrable, CU waived its right to arbitrate\n\nthat  claim based  upon its  pretrial  participation in  this\n\nlawsuit.  This contention we find meritless.\n\n          In  deciding  this  issue,  we  first  discuss  the\n\nappropriate  standard of  review.    As  the  district  court\n\ndecided the arbitrability  question by margin order,  we have\n\nno  predicate factual  findings to  review.   In fact,  it is\n\npossible that the  district court did not  reach the question\n\nof waiver but decided against  CU solely on the basis of  its\n\n                    \n\n4.  To support its position that the district court's refusal\nto grant the  stay was correct, Gilbane relies  upon a series\nof cases which,  it asserts, stand  for the proposition  that\nprime  contract provisions  unrelated  to  the  work  of  the\nsubcontractor  are  not  incorporated  by  reference  into  a\nsubcontract.

We discuss these contentions in\n\nturn.  \n\n          Gilbane first argues that it would suffer prejudice\n\nfrom  having to  defend  against Count  I  of CU's  complaint\n\nwithout its  counterclaim.   Accepting this contention  would\n\nrequire, in essence, a finding that the thirteen construction\n\nprojects are factually inseparable.   This is simply not  the\n\ncase.   Suppose, for instance, that the counterclaim proceeds\n\nto arbitration  and is  decided in Gilbane's  favor.   Assume\n\nfurther that  the underlying lawsuit  results in an  award to\n\nCU.  Under that scenario,  the arbitration award could act as\n\na stipulated  setoff from the  amount awarded CU  in district\n\ncourt.5    We are  unable  to  imagine  a scenario  in  which\n\nGilbane would suffer  prejudice from having to defend Count I\n\nof  CU's  complaint  in the  underlying  lawsuit  without its\n\ncounterclaim.   Nor has  Gilbane outlined  such a  scenario.6\n\n                    \n\n5.  We note that  Gilbane's attorney conceded as  much during\noral argument.\n\n6.  Gilbane  also  argues   that,  because  it   pleaded  the\nsubstance  of its counterclaim  as an affirmative  defense in\nits  answer  to  the  complaint, it  should  be  permitted to\nlitigate  the substance  of  that  claim  in  the  underlying\naction.  Whether  we characterize the substance  of Gilbane's\nclaim as  a \"counterclaim\"  or a  \"setoff defense,\"  however,\nmakes no difference  for the purposes of  determining whether\nGilbane  will theoretically be prejudiced by severing it from\n                                         \nthe  underlying lawsuit.  Second, and more important, Gilbane\nis, in our opinion, relying upon creative pleading to make an\nend run around an arbitration  agreement.  We have previously\nrejected a  party's reliance upon procedural  gamesmanship to\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nWe therefore  find unpersuasive  its belated  contention that\n\none might exist.\n\n          Gilbane also asserts that it would suffer prejudice\n\nby  having  to defend  against  Count  II of  CU's  complaint\n\nwithout  its  counterclaim.   Again,  Gilbane  has  failed to\n\nprovide an example of how it might be prejudiced.  It appears\n                         \n\nto  be  arguing,   instead,  that  it  would   be  judicially\n\ninefficient to litigate  CU's ch. 93A claim in  one forum and\n\nGilbane's ch.  93A claim in  another.7  While Gilbane  may be\n\ncorrect,   we  fail  to   see  how  any   resulting  judicial\n\ninefficiency would prejudice  Gilbane.8   Cf.
