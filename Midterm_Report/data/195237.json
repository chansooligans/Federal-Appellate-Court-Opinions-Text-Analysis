The  district  court\n\nentered  summary judgment  for  Medtronic,  ruling  that  the\n\nexpress preemption  clause of  the Medical  Device Amendments\n\n(MDA) of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act),\n\n21  U.S.C.     360k(a),  preempted plaintiff's  Massachusetts\n\ncommon law claims.1  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Congress enacted the MDA to  give the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration  (FDA)  comprehensive   control  over  medical\n\ndevices  for the  first time.

Optical Radiation\n                                                             \n\nCorp., 961 F.2d  1330, 1331 (7th Cir.), cert.  denied, 113 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 327  (1992).  The  MDA reflects Congress's  balancing the\n\nneed  for regulation  to protect  public  health against  its\n\ninterest  in allowing new and improved devices to be marketed\n\nexpeditiously  without the costs attributable to an excess of\n\nregulation.

See  21 U.S.C.\n                                                  \n\n  360c;  H.R. Conf. Rep.  No. 1090, 94th  Cong., 2d  Sess. 55\n\n(1976),  reprinted  in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N.  1103,  1107.   All\n                      \n\nclasses  of  devices  are   subject  to  \"general  controls,\"\n\nincluding  labeling   requirements  and   good  manufacturing\n\npractices.  See,  e.g., 21 U.S.C.     360i, 360j.   Class III\n                      \n\ndevices, such as  pacemakers, pose the greatest  risks.  Such\n\ndevices  may  be  sold  only  if  FDA  finds  that  they  are\n\n\"substantially equivalent\"  in design and function to devices\n\non the market before the MDA became effective in 1976, or--in\n\nthe case of  new or improved devices--if FDA grants premarket\n\napproval.    Id.      360c(a)(1)(C),  360e(b);  21  C.F.R.   \n                \n\n807.100.   Devices found to be \"substantially equivalent\" are\n\nentitled to bypass  the premarket approval process  unless or\n\nuntil  FDA issues  a regulation  specifying  that the  device\n\nundergo the review process. \n\n          On May 14, 1986, a Medtronic pacemaker, a Class III\n\ndevice,  was   implanted  into  plaintiff.     Medtronic  had\n\ndistributed  the  pacemaker  since  1981  without   premarket\n\napproval   because   no  regulation   specifically   required\n\npremarket approval, and because FDA found the pacemaker to be\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nsubstantially equivalent to pre-MDA pacemakers.  On March 10,\n\n1992, the pacemaker  failed, and plaintiff nearly  died.  The\n\npacemaker was surgically removed, anda new model implanted.  \n\n          Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that Medtronic\n\nwas negligent  in designing, manufacturing,  and distributing\n\nher pacemaker.  She also included claims alleging Medtronic's\n\nfailure  to  provide  adequate warnings,  and  breach  of the\n\nimplied  warranty of  merchantability.   Medtronic moved  for\n\nsummary  judgment  on the  ground  that 21  U.S.C.    360k(a)\n\npreempted  all of  plaintiff's claims.    The district  court\n\ngranted the motion, and plaintiff appealed.2 \n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          Our review of a  district court's summary  judgment\n\ndecision is plenary.  FDIC v. Anchor Properties, No. 93-1542,\n                                               \n\nslip op. at 9  (1st Cir. Jan. 5, 1993).   Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate  when  the  pleadings  and  affidavits  raise  no\n\n                    \n\n2.  On  the  date  the order  granting  summary  judgment was\nentered,  plaintiff  moved  to  amend  her  complaint.    The\nproposed  amended  complaint  reiterated  the  claims  in her\noriginal complaint and  added causes of action for  breach of\nexpress warranty, negligent infliction of emotional distress,\nand  strict liability.  The proposed complaint also clarified\nthat  she  was  alleging that  her  particular  pacemaker, as\n                                              \nopposed to  the model,  was  defective.   The district  court\ndenied the motion to amend after plaintiff filed an appeal of\nthe  summary  judgment  order.    Plaintiff's  brief  neither\nchallenges  the district  court's rejection  of her  proposed\namended  complaint, nor  refers specifically  to  any of  the\nclaims raised solely  in her amended complaint.   Because our\nreview is limited to the  issues raised on appeal, we confine\nour analysis to the claims in the original complaint on which\nthe district court granted summary judgment.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ngenuine issue as  to any material fact, and  the moving party\n\nis entitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.

P. 56(c).  \n\n          The  nonmoving party bears the burden of placing at\n\nleast  one material fact into dispute  after the moving party\n\nshows  the  absence of  material  fact.    Celotex  Corp.  v.\n                                                         \n\nCatrett, 477  U.S. 317, 325  (1986).  Evidence in  the record\n       \n\nsupports that  plaintiff's pacemaker was defective;  that the\n\ndefect caused plaintiff's  injuries; and  that Medtronic  was\n\naware,  before the pacemaker failed, that the model might not\n\nwork properly.  \n\n          Medtronic  asserted  in  its   motion  for  summary\n\njudgment that \"[t]here are no genuine issues of material fact\n\nsince  even  if   plaintiff  could  prove  all   her  factual\n\nallegations,\"  her claims would be preempted.  Medtronic also\n\nstated,  \"[f]or  the  purposes  of  its  Motion  for  Summary\n\nJudgment  only,\"  that  it  did  not  dispute  the  following\n              \n\nallegations of plaintiff:  \n\n          1.   [A]  Medtronic   [pacemaker],  model\n          number  5984LP   (the  \"device\"),   [was]\n          implanted  into  [plaintiff] on  May  14,\n          1986 . . . . \n          2.   [T]he  device  failed on  March  10,\n          1992 . . . .\n          3.   This alleged  failure caused  a near\n          death  circumstance  and   plaintiff  was\n          required to undergo  emergency surgery to\n          remove the . . . device . . . .  \n          4.   [Plaintiff's]  injuries .  . .  were\n          due to  defects in  the labeling,  design\n          and manufacture of the device . . . .\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nDef.'s Mot. for Summ. J., at 2-3 (emphasis in original).  \n\n          We take these assertions at  face value.  We assume\n\nplaintiff's  factual allegations are true, and we examine the\n\nlegal issues in this light.   Medtronic does not contend that\n\nplaintiff's   allegations  fail   to  state  a   claim  under\n\nMassachusetts  law.  The sole  issue addressed by the parties\n\nand the district court is  preemption, which is the key issue\n\non appeal. \n\n                             II.\n\n                          PREEMPTION\n                                    \n\n          Medtronic  argues  that  the  Act  implicitly   and\n\nexpressly  preempts plaintiff's claims.  Congress's intent is\n\nthe  touchstone of preemption analysis.  Cipollone v. Liggett\n                                                             \n\nGroup, 112 S. Ct. 2608,  2617 (1992); King v.

The complaint states:  \n\n          Prior  to  May  14,  1986  the  defendant\n          Medtronic  Inc.  .  .  .  manufactured  a\n          certain device [known] as a pacemaker.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n               As a result of the negligence of the\n          defendant,  Medtronic  Inc.,  in control,\n          maintenance, inspection, testing, design,\n          developing,    servicing,   distribution,\n          alteration,  modification,  sale   and/or\n          manufacturing of  said device,  and as  a\n                                       \n          result   of   the  negligence   of   said\n          defendant . . . in placing said Medtronic\n          pacemaker model #5984LP in the stream  of\n          medical care and failing to give adequate\n          and  effective  warning   concerning  the\n          [foreseeable] dangers in the use of  said\n          device, the plaintiff . . . was caused to\n          be  injured on  March  10, 1992,  by this\n                                                   \n          defective pacemaker.\n                             \n          . . . \n               .  .  .

The highlighted  statements allege  that\n\nplaintiff's    particular    pacemaker     was    negligently\n\nmanufactured;  the reference  to  the  model  number  of  the\n\npacemaker  is consistent with  claims that the  label carried\n\ninadequate warnings, and  that the design  of the device  was\n\ndefective.  Plaintiff's  complaint thus contains  three types\n\nof claims, each sounding in  negligence and breach of implied\n\nwarranty:   design defect, failure to warn, and manufacturing\n\ndefect.    The  complaint contains  no  allegation  regarding\n\nMedtronic's compliance  with FDA  regulations, and  plaintiff\n\nhas offered no evidence on that issue.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          In  her brief,  plaintiff  abandoned  any claim  of\n\ndefective  design.3   At  oral argument,  plaintiff contended\n\nthat   her   allegations   of   Medtronic's   negligence   in\n\n\"alter[ing]\"  and  \"modif[ying]\"   the  device  survived  her\n\nabandonment  of the  design  defect  claims.    According  to\n\nplaintiff,  these claims  allege  that  Medtronic  failed  to\n\nobtain  FDA  approval  prior  to  distributing  the  modified\n\npacemaker  model implanted in  plaintiff.  It  is undisputed,\n\nhowever, that FDA cleared the pacemaker for marketing without\n\napproving  the  product  design,  finding  it  \"substantially\n\nequivalent\" to  pre-MDA devices.   See  42 Fed.  Reg. 42,520,\n                                      \n\n42,525  (Aug.  23,  1977)  (preamble  to  final  rule)  (\"[A]\n\ndetermination of substantial equivalence . . . relates to the\n\nfact  that the  product  can  lawfully  be  marketed  without\n\npremarket approval or reclassification.\"); 21 C.F.R.   807.97\n\n(a  finding of substantial  equivalence \"does not  in any way\n\ndenote  official approval of  the device\").   FDA regulations\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiff's brief states:  \n          Ellen Mendes  does  not  claim  that  the\n          entire  product   line  from   which  her\n          pacemaker was manufactured was defective.\n          The claims in  this action do not  allege\n          that  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of\n          Medtronic, Inc.'s pacemaker device, as it\n          was  designed and  approved  by the  FDA,\n          caused  Ellen  Mendes's  injuries.    The\n          claims in her complaint  allege that Mrs.\n          Mendes  was  injured  because  Medtronic,\n          Inc.  manufactured  and  distributed this\n          specific  pacemaker   device  which   was\n          itself  individually  defective  and  the\n          direct cause of her injuries.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nhave never required that the pacemaker of the model implanted\n\nin plaintiff  receive premarket  approval.   See 21  C.F.R.  \n                                                \n\n870.3610(c).   Moreover, plaintiff has not alleged that FDA's\n\nsubstantial  equivalence finding  was  improper.   Therefore,\n\nplaintiff's product  line alteration and  modification claims\n\nfall from this case.  If the claims are design defect claims,\n\nthey have  been abandoned.  And if the claims allege that FDA\n\nfailed  to  grant  the device  premarket  approval,  they are\n\nmeritless.\n\n          Plaintiff's abandonment of her design defect claims\n\nalso  forecloses our consideration  of her argument  that, in\n\nthe   absence  of  a  requirement  that  the  device  receive\n\npremarket  approval,  her  design   defect  claims  are   not\n\npreempted.   The  cases  cited by  plaintiff to  support that\n\nargument  are  thus   inapposite.    See,  e.g.,   Larsen  v.\n                                                         \n\nPacesetter Systems, 837  P.2d 1273, 1282 (Haw.  1992) (design\n                  \n\ndefect  claims are  not preempted  where  FDA never  approved\n\ndevice  design because device  was found to  be substantially\n\nequivalent  to pre-MDA devices); see also Stamps, 984 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1419, 1421-22  (discussing Moore v.

In this connection,  the MDA provides that  a state\n\nrequirement,  if  different from  or  in addition  to  an FDA\n\nrequirement, is preempted only if  it \"relates to\" the safety\n\nor effectiveness  of the device  or to any  other requirement\n\nunder  the Act.  21 U.S.C.    306k(a)(2).  All of plaintiff's\n\nclaims relate  to the  pacemaker's safety  and effectiveness.\n\nSee Stamps, 984 F.2d at  1422.  Consequently, to complete our\n          \n\npreemption analysis,  we must  determine whether  plaintiff's\n\nnegligence and implied warranty claims, if  successful, would\n\nimpose requirements on Medtronic's pacemaker \"different from,\n\nor in addition to\" those in the Act.  21 U.S.C.   306k(a)(1).\n\n          The common law, no less than agency regulations and\n\nstatutes,  can impose \"requirements\" on a manufacturer.

Medtronic's  duty under  the  common law  of\n\nnegligence  is to use reasonable care in inspecting, testing,\n\nand  producing  pacemakers.   This  standard  and  FDA's good\n\nmanufacturing practices  impose analogous, but  not identical\n\nduties.    FDA's  good  manufacturing  practices  regulations\n\nrequire manufacturers to develop and implement \"appropriate,\"\n\n\"adequate,\"   or   \"sufficient\"  quality   control,   quality\n\nassurance,   personnel   training,   environmental  controls,\n\nequipment maintenance,  testing, inspection, and  storage and\n\ndistribution  procedures, to assure that devices are safe and\n\neffective.   See, e.g., id.     820.1, 820.5, 820.20, 820.25.\n                           \n\nThe quality assurance requirement, for example, mandates that\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nmanufacturers  devise and  implement  a  protocol to  ensure,\n\namong other things,  that all components, labels,  packaging,\n\nand  finished devices are  inspected, and either  approved or\n\nrejected.

A  factfinder  could  find\n                \n\nliability  on  plaintiff's  negligent  manufacturing  claims,\n\napplying standards differing from or adding to FDA's.   \n\n          Plaintiff's   implied   warranty  claim   is   also\n\npreempted  by   FDA's  good   manufacturing  practices.     A\n\nfactfinder considering that claim could find Medtronic liable\n\nif  a  manufacturing  defect rendered  plaintiff's  pacemaker\n\nunreasonably dangerous.  See Mass.  Gen.

One way  to ensure that  a factfinder applies  a standard\nnot  adding  to  or  differing  from FDA  regulations  is  to\nsupplant the common law standard with FDA's requirements.

Such\n\ndevices  may  be  sold  only  if  FDA  finds  that  they  are\n\n\"substantially equivalent\"  in design and function to devices\n\non the market before the MDA became effective in 1976, or--in\n\nthe case of  new or improved devices--if FDA grants premarket\n\napproval.

Devices found to be \"substantially equivalent\" are\n\nentitled to bypass  the premarket approval process  unless or\n\nuntil  FDA issues  a regulation  specifying  that the  device\n\nundergo the review process. \n\n          On May 14, 1986, a Medtronic pacemaker, a Class III\n\ndevice,  was   implanted  into  plaintiff.     Medtronic  had\n\ndistributed  the  pacemaker  since  1981  without   premarket\n\napproval   because   no  regulation   specifically   required\n\npremarket approval, and because FDA found the pacemaker to be\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nsubstantially equivalent to pre-MDA pacemakers.  On March 10,\n\n1992, the pacemaker  failed, and plaintiff nearly  died.  The\n\npacemaker was surgically removed, anda new model implanted.  \n\n          Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that Medtronic\n\nwas negligent  in designing, manufacturing,  and distributing\n\nher pacemaker.  She also included claims alleging Medtronic's\n\nfailure  to  provide  adequate warnings,  and  breach  of the\n\nimplied  warranty of  merchantability.   Medtronic moved  for\n\nsummary  judgment  on the  ground  that 21  U.S.C.    360k(a)\n\npreempted  all of  plaintiff's claims.    The district  court\n\ngranted the motion, and plaintiff appealed.2 \n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          Our review of a  district court's summary  judgment\n\ndecision is plenary.

On  the  date  the order  granting  summary  judgment was\nentered,  plaintiff  moved  to  amend  her  complaint.    The\nproposed  amended  complaint  reiterated  the  claims  in her\noriginal complaint and  added causes of action for  breach of\nexpress warranty, negligent infliction of emotional distress,\nand  strict liability.  The proposed complaint also clarified\nthat  she  was  alleging that  her  particular  pacemaker, as\n                                              \nopposed to  the model,  was  defective.   The district  court\ndenied the motion to amend after plaintiff filed an appeal of\nthe  summary  judgment  order.    Plaintiff's  brief  neither\nchallenges  the district  court's rejection  of her  proposed\namended  complaint, nor  refers specifically  to  any of  the\nclaims raised solely  in her amended complaint.   Because our\nreview is limited to the  issues raised on appeal, we confine\nour analysis to the claims in the original complaint on which\nthe district court granted summary judgment.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ngenuine issue as  to any material fact, and  the moving party\n\nis entitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.

Medtronic does not contend that\n\nplaintiff's   allegations  fail   to  state  a   claim  under\n\nMassachusetts  law.

The highlighted  statements allege  that\n\nplaintiff's    particular    pacemaker     was    negligently\n\nmanufactured;  the reference  to  the  model  number  of  the\n\npacemaker  is consistent with  claims that the  label carried\n\ninadequate warnings, and  that the design  of the device  was\n\ndefective.  Plaintiff's  complaint thus contains  three types\n\nof claims, each sounding in  negligence and breach of implied\n\nwarranty:   design defect, failure to warn, and manufacturing\n\ndefect.    The  complaint contains  no  allegation  regarding\n\nMedtronic's compliance  with FDA  regulations, and  plaintiff\n\nhas offered no evidence on that issue.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          In  her brief,  plaintiff  abandoned  any claim  of\n\ndefective  design.3   At  oral argument,  plaintiff contended\n\nthat   her   allegations   of   Medtronic's   negligence   in\n\n\"alter[ing]\"  and  \"modif[ying]\"   the  device  survived  her\n\nabandonment  of the  design  defect  claims.    According  to\n\nplaintiff,  these claims  allege  that  Medtronic  failed  to\n\nobtain  FDA  approval  prior  to  distributing  the  modified\n\npacemaker  model implanted in  plaintiff.  It  is undisputed,\n\nhowever, that FDA cleared the pacemaker for marketing without\n\napproving  the  product  design,  finding  it  \"substantially\n\nequivalent\" to  pre-MDA devices.   See  42 Fed.  Reg. 42,520,\n                                      \n\n42,525  (Aug.  23,  1977)  (preamble  to  final  rule)  (\"[A]\n\ndetermination of substantial equivalence . . . relates to the\n\nfact  that the  product  can  lawfully  be  marketed  without\n\npremarket approval or reclassification.\"); 21 C.F.R.   807.97\n\n(a  finding of substantial  equivalence \"does not  in any way\n\ndenote  official approval of  the device\").   FDA regulations\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiff's brief states:  \n          Ellen Mendes  does  not  claim  that  the\n          entire  product   line  from   which  her\n          pacemaker was manufactured was defective.\n          The claims in  this action do not  allege\n          that  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of\n          Medtronic, Inc.'s pacemaker device, as it\n          was  designed and  approved  by the  FDA,\n          caused  Ellen  Mendes's  injuries.    The\n          claims in her complaint  allege that Mrs.\n          Mendes  was  injured  because  Medtronic,\n          Inc.  manufactured  and  distributed this\n          specific  pacemaker   device  which   was\n          itself  individually  defective  and  the\n          direct cause of her injuries.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nhave never required that the pacemaker of the model implanted\n\nin plaintiff  receive premarket  approval.   See 21  C.F.R.  \n                                                \n\n870.3610(c).   Moreover, plaintiff has not alleged that FDA's\n\nsubstantial  equivalence finding  was  improper.   Therefore,\n\nplaintiff's product  line alteration and  modification claims\n\nfall from this case.  If the claims are design defect claims,\n\nthey have  been abandoned.  And if the claims allege that FDA\n\nfailed  to  grant  the device  premarket  approval,  they are\n\nmeritless.\n\n          Plaintiff's abandonment of her design defect claims\n\nalso  forecloses our consideration  of her argument  that, in\n\nthe   absence  of  a  requirement  that  the  device  receive\n\npremarket  approval,  her  design   defect  claims  are   not\n\npreempted.   The  cases  cited by  plaintiff to  support that\n\nargument  are  thus   inapposite.

Medtronic's  duty under  the  common law  of\n\nnegligence  is to use reasonable care in inspecting, testing,\n\nand  producing  pacemakers.   This  standard  and  FDA's good\n\nmanufacturing practices  impose analogous, but  not identical\n\nduties.    FDA's  good  manufacturing  practices  regulations\n\nrequire manufacturers to develop and implement \"appropriate,\"\n\n\"adequate,\"   or   \"sufficient\"  quality   control,   quality\n\nassurance,   personnel   training,   environmental  controls,\n\nequipment maintenance,  testing, inspection, and  storage and\n\ndistribution  procedures, to assure that devices are safe and\n\neffective.

One way  to ensure that  a factfinder applies  a standard\nnot  adding  to  or  differing  from FDA  regulations  is  to\nsupplant the common law standard with FDA's requirements.  We\nfind  nothing  to  support  that  Congress  intended  such  a\nradical, unwieldy form  of preemption, however,  particularly\nwhere Congress  did not intend  to create a private  right of\naction under the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act.

This claim, according to plaintiff, is analogous\n\nto  a claim that the device is contaminated.  She argues that\n\nher claims are not preempted because King v.  Collagen Corp.,\n                                                            \n\n983 F.2d at 1134-35, excised claims arising from contaminated\n\ndevices from the body of claims preempted by the MDA.\n\n          Plaintiff's argument is based on a misunderstanding\n\nof our  remarks in King v. Collagen  Corp., 983 F.2d at 1134-\n                                          \n\n35.
