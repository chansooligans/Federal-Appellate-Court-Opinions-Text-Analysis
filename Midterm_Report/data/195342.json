Pro-se  petitioner Kawee Lauvera appeals an\n               \n\norder of the  Board of Immigration Appeals [BIA]  finding him\n\ndeportable under  section 241(a)(2)(A)(i) of  the Immigration\n\nand Nationality  Act  [INA],  8  U.S.C.     1251(a)(2)(A)(1),\n\ndenying  his   application  for  asylum  and  withholding  of\n\ndeportation under  sections 208(a) and  243(h) of the  INA, 8\n\nU.S.C.     1158(a) &amp;  1253(h), and  ordering him deported  to\n\nThailand.  We affirm.\n\n     There  is  no  merit  in  petitioner's contention  that,\n\nbecause  he served a term of imprisonment of only six months,\n\nthe BIA  erred  in finding  him  deportable for  having  been\n\nconvicted of credit  card fraud.  First,  petitioner, who was\n\nthen  represented by  counsel,  conceded  at his  deportation\n\nhearing  that  he  was  deportable   on  the  basis  of  this\n\nconviction.   Moreover, even if the  issue were not therefore\n\nwaived,  any  alien  who  has  committed  a  crime  of  moral\n\nturpitude  and \"is  sentenced to  confinement or  is confined\n                                             \n\ntherefor in a prison or correctional institution for one year\n\nor  longer\"   is  deportable.    8  U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(1)\n\n(emphasis added).  Petitioner, who was sentenced to a term of\n\nimprisonment at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at\n\nConcord \"not exceeding five years,\" is within the purview  of\n\nthis provision.  See,  e.g., United States ex rel.  Sirtie v.\n                                                          \n\nCommissioner of Immigration, 6 F.2d 233, 234 (D.N.Y. 1925) (a\n                           \n\nreformatory sentence to a term which  \"shall not exceed . . .\n\n                             -2-\n\nthree  years\" was a three  year sentence for  purposes of the\n\n1917  Immigration Act);  United  States ex  rel.

Clingan, 273 F.2d 688,  691 (10th Cir.\n                              \n\n1960) (similar,  under the  1952 INA);  see also  Campbell v.\n                                                          \n\nCommonwealth, 339 Mass. 695,  697 (1959) (under Massachusetts\n            \n\nlaw, the length  of sentence  for an indefinite  term is  its\n\nmaximum term).\n\n     Petitioner further  contends  that he  is  eligible  for\n\nasylum or the  withholding of  deportation because  he has  a\n\n\"well  founded fear of persecution\" on account of his Chinese\n\nheritage if he is returned to Thailand.  Petitioner, however,\n\nadmits that neither  he nor  has family, who  still lives  in\n\nThailand, has  ever been  subject to  persecution.   The only\n\nevidence  for his  fear is  a statement,  in a  Department of\n\nState report, which  indicates that there  is in Thailand  \"a\n\ntradition  of popular  resentment directed  against [Chinese]\n\ntrading  and  financial  activities.\"     Not  only  is  this\n\nstatement too generalized to support a  \"well founded fear of\n\npersecution,\"  see Khalaf v.  INS, 909 F.2d  589, 592-93 (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1990),  but the  very report  relied upon  by petitioner\n\nfinds  that  \"[t]his resentment  has  never  provoked violent\n\npersecution and is dissipating as the Chinese are assimilated\n\ninto Thai society.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Finally, petitioner is not eligible  for a discretionary\n\nwaiver  of deportation pursuant to section 212(c) of the INA,\n\n8 U.S.C.   1182(c).  Section 212(c) applies only to \"[a]liens\n\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence.\"  See Michelson v.\n                                                          \n\nINS, 897 F.2d 465, 469 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"Permanent residence\n   \n\nstatus is an essential element for discretionary relief under\n\n   1182(c).\").
