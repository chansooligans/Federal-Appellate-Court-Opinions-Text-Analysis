Plaintiff-appellant Charles  J. Oropallo, a\n               \n\nNew  Hampshire inmate, appeals  pro se from  the dismissal of\n\nhis amended  civil rights  complaint for  failure to  state a\n\nclaim.  For the reasons stated below, we modify the dismissal\n\nin part, and, otherwise, affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     On June 8,  1993, appellant filed  an in forma  pauperis\n\ncomplaint  in the  district court  alleging violations  of 42\n\nU.S.C.     1983,  1985 against  various prison  employees and\n\nofficials,  as  well  as against  two  fellow  inmates.   The\n\ncomplaint also included two pendent state law claims.\n\n     The  following facts  were alleged  by Oropallo,  and we\n\nassume for purposes of this  opinion that they are true.   In\n\nearly 1991,  defendant  Viola Lunderville,  Administrator  of\n\nSecurity,  terminated appellant  from his  job at  the prison\n\nrecreation   department.    Appellant   filed  a  civil  suit\n\nregarding this  termination.1  In  April 1991,  approximately\n\nsix   weeks  after   terminating  appellant  from   his  job,\n\nLunderville  allegedly  conspired with  defendant  Richard L.\n\nParrish,  a prison  official,  to  fabricate charges  against\n\nappellant.      Parrish   subsequently   authored   a   false\n\ndisciplinary report stating that he  had received information\n\n                    \n\n1.  The complaint does not state when this suit was filed.\n\n                             -2-\n\nfrom  two inmates  leading  him to  search appellant's  hobby\n\ncraft locker where Parrish found state property.2 \n\n     After  what Oropallo  alleges  was a  sham  disciplinary\n\nhearing, he was found guilty of unlawful possession of  state\n\nproperty.  The guilty finding was upheld by defendant Michael\n\nCunningham, the  prison warden, and defendant  Ronald Powell,\n\nCommissioner of the New  Hampshire Department of Corrections.\n\nThereafter,  Oropallo  filed  a  civil suit  challenging  the\n\ndisciplinary proceeding.\n\n     Since   April  1991,   and   in  connection   with   the\n\n\"fabricated\"  charge, Oropallo allegedly has been banned from\n\nentering  the North  Yard  area of  the  prison.   Defendants\n\nDonald G.  Robb and George R. Sasser,  both prison employees,\n\nhave allegedly  participated in  banning him from  this area.\n\nOropallo  avers that  he has  been denied  use of  the prison\n\ngymnasium,  hobby  craft  shop,  North Yard  ball  field  and\n\nattendance at  a  jazz concert  and  a power  lifting  event.\n\nOropallo further avers that this \"punishment\" is in excess of\n\nthat normally handed down for disciplinary violations.3\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  complaint alleges that  these two inmate informants,\nidentified  as  defendants John  Doe  #1  and  John  Doe  #2,\nconspired  with Parrish  to  deprive appellant  of his  civil\nrights.\n\n3.  Although the complaint is  far from clear on this  point,\nit appears that the ban from  entering the North Yard area of\nthe prison and from participating in  recreational activities\nwas  imposed prior to the  disciplinary hearing.   The ban is\nallegedly  still in effect.  It appears from Oropallo's brief\nthat the sanctions imposed following the disciplinary hearing\n\n                             -3-\n\n     In May  1992, Oropallo made inquiries  of various prison\n\nofficials,  including defendant  Powell, regarding  his being\n\nbanned from the North Yard area  of the prison.  Several days\n\nlater,   appellant's   typewriter  and   legal   papers  were\n\nconfiscated by defendant Loran  Ackerman, a prison  official.\n\nAppellant filed  a civil suit contesting  the confiscation of\n\nhis legal materials.\n\n     Based on these facts,  the complaint alleged a violation\n\nof Oropallo's constitutional rights  to due process and equal\n\nprotection, citing the Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nto the Constitution.  In addition, the complaint alleged that\n\nOropallo has been unconstitutionally  subjected to cruel  and\n\nunusual punishment in violation  of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\n\n     The  complaint  was initially  referred to  a magistrate\n\njudge (hereinafter,  magistrate)  who reviewed  it  prior  to\n\ncompleting service.    See 28  U.S.C.    1915(d); Neitzke  v.\n                                                         \n\nWilliams,  490 U.S.  319,  327-28 (1989)  (to avoid  wasteful\n        \n\nlitigation,  under    1915(d)  the court  may dismiss  claims\n\nwhich are  based on indisputably meritless  legal theories or\n\ndelusional factual scenarios).  The magistrate concluded that\n\nOropallo's \"claims concerning attendance at  the jazz concert\n\nand special  event and use  of the hobby craft  shop and ball\n\n                    \n\nand guilty  finding  were suspended  loss  of good  time  and\nsuspended punitive segregation time. \n\n                             -4-\n\nfield  are  frivolous,\"   and  that   his  claim   concerning\n\ndeprivation  of  exercise  is  insufficient to  make  out  an\n\nactionable constitutional violation.   The magistrate granted\n\nOropallo  thirty days in which to amend his complaint or face\n\na recommendation of dismissal.  \n\n     Oropallo filed an amended complaint which restated his  \n\n1983 causes of action  as claims for harassment, constituting\n\ncruel   and  unusual   punishment,  and   discrimination,  in\n\nviolation of  his rights to due process and equal protection.\n\nThe amended complaint was otherwise identical to the original\n\ncomplaint.     Oropallo  did   not  aver  that   the  alleged\n\ndiscrimination  was directed  towards him  as a  member of  a\n\nparticular class,  or offer any other reason  for the alleged\n\ndisparate treatment.\n\n     After  reviewing  Oropallo's   amended  complaint,   the\n\nmagistrate  recommended that the  complaint be  dismissed for\n\nfailure to state a  claim.4  See Forte v. Sullivan,  935 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (a district court may sua sponte dismiss\n\nan in forma pauperis  complaint for failure to state  a claim\n\nfollowing notice and an opportunity to amend in a manner that\n\nwould satisfy  the procedural safeguards  of Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6)).  In support  of his recommendation, the magistrate\n\nstated:\n\n                    \n\n4.  The magistrate  did not state whether  this dismissal was\nintended to  be pursuant  to    1915(d)  or Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\n12(b)(6).\n\n                             -5-\n\n     In his original  complaint, plaintiff alleged  that\n     he  had  been   deprived  of  certain  recreational\n     activities.   Plaintiff  was ordered  to amend  his\n     complaint to  state facts  that show  an indefinite\n     limitation on exercise that could be harmful to his\n     health.   However,  the amended  complaint does  no\n     more  than repeat  the  conclusory  allegations  of\n     plaintiff's initial complaint,  namely, that he has\n     been deprived of \"various recreational activities.\"\n     Amended Complaint at paras. 29, and  30.  Thus, the\n     court finds that plaintiff  has failed to show that\n     he has suffered any constitutional deprivation.\n\n     Oropallo filed a timely  objection in which he disavowed\n\never making  a claim concerning lack of  exercise, and argued\n\nthat  he  had  stated  a   valid  claim  for  harassment  and\n\ndiscrimination in  violation of    1983.   In his  objection,\n\nOropallo, for the  first time, articulated  a motive for  the\n\nalleged discrimination.   Oropallo  stated that he  was being\n\ndiscriminated against in retaliation  for the exercise of his\n\nfirst amendment right to file complaints.  \n\n     The district court reviewed the matter, and approved the\n\nmagistrate's  report  without  stating   additional  reasons.\n\nJudgment  of  dismissal entered  on  August 12,  1993.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     Oropallo argues  that his amended  complaint should  not\n\nhave  been dismissed because  it states valid  claims under  \n\n1983 for violations of  his constitutional rights to be  free\n\n                             -6-\n\nfrom cruel  and unusual  punishment, to equal  protection, to\n\nproceduraldue process,and topetition thecourts.5 We disagree.\n\n     Since appellant  was placed on notice  of the inadequacy\n\nof  his complaint  and has  had an  opportunity to  amend, we\n\nconstrue the  dismissal of his amended  complaint for failure\n\nto state a claim as a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.  See Guglielmo\n                                                             \n\nv.  Cunningham, 811  F. Supp.  31 (D.N.H.  1993).   Appellate\n              \n\nreview of a dismissal  under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Miranda v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991).   The standard for  assessing the adequacy  of a civil\n\nrights claim is whether, accepting the factual allegations in\n\nthe  complaint as  true, and  construing these  facts in  the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleading shows any\n\nfact which could entitle the plaintiff to relief.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nLeatherman  v.   Tarrant  County  Narcotics   Intelligence  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nCoordination Unit, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 1161-63 (1993); Gooley v.\n                                                          \n\nMobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514  (1st Cir. 1988).  Because\n               \n\nappellant appears pro se, we read his complaint with an extra\n\n                    \n\n5.  Oropallo does not raise on appeal the dismissal of his 42\nU.S.C.    1985  claim  and it  is, therefore,  deemed waived.\nEven if  we were to  address this  issue, we would  hold that\nthis  claim  was  properly  dismissed.   Appellant  does  not\nspecify  the  subsection of     1985  upon which  he  relies.\nHowever, the  complaint can only conceivably  be construed as\nasserting   a   claim  under       1985(3)  which   prohibits\nconspiracies   to   interfere  with   the  civil   rights  of\nindividuals.  As so construed, the complaint fails to state a\ncause  of  action  because  plaintiff does  not  allege  that\ndefendants' actions were directed at a protected class.   See\n                                                             \nBray  v. Alexandria  Women's Health  Clinic,  113 S.  Ct. 753\n                                           \n(1993).\n\n                             -7-\n\ndegree  of solicitude.  Rodi  v. Ventetuolo, 941  F.2d 22, 23\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     Oropallo's  procedural due  process  claim is  far  from\n\nclear.  The disciplinary hearing that appellant claims was  a\n\nsham  is the  subject  of an  independent  complaint, and  he\n\ndisavows  any  intent to  challenge  that  proceeding in  the\n\ninstant  amended  complaint.    Instead,  appellant's  theory\n\nappears  to be that  since the  deprivations he  complains of\n\nwere not  imposed  as sanctions  following this  disciplinary\n\nhearing,   or  following   any   other  hearing,   they  were\n\nunconstitutionally imposed without any process.  \n\n     This claim,  however, must fail  if there is  no liberty\n\ninterest  in the  activities he alleges  he has  been denied.\n\nSee,  e.g., Kentucky  Dep't of  Corrections v.  Thompson, 490\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 454 (1989) (holding  that visitation privileges could be\n\nsuspended  without  hearing  where  no  liberty  interest  in\n\nreceiving  visitors existed).    Appellant has  abandoned any\n\nallegation that  he has  been deprived of  adequate exercise,\n\nand the Constitution does  not create an enforceable interest\n\nin recreational  programs designed to relieve  the boredom of\n\nprison life.   Although  liberty interests  may be  rooted in\n\nstate  law, none of the prison rules invoked by the appellant\n\ncould  conceivably be interpreted  as creating an entitlement\n\nto recreation.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     We need  not devote much attention  to Oropallo's Eighth\n\nAmendment claim.  The  deprivations Oropallo complains of are\n\nnot sufficiently weighty to implicate the Eighth  Amendment's\n\nban  on  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.    See  Hudson   v.\n                                                        \n\nMcMillian, 112  S. Ct.  995, 1000  (1992) (stating  that only\n         \n\nthose deprivations  denying the minimal civilized  measure of\n\nlife's necessities  are sufficiently grave to  form the basis\n\nof an Eighth Amendment violation). \n\n     Appellant's   claim  that  he   has  been  denied  equal\n\nprotection because prison officials imposed harsher sanctions\n\non him than  on others  \"similarly situated\" also  fails.   A\n\nperson bringing  an action under the  equal protection clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment must either show a violation of a\n\nfundamental right or \"intentional discrimination  against him\n\nbecause  of his membership in a  particular class, not merely\n\nthat he was treated unfairly as an individual.\"  Huebschen v.\n                                                          \n\nDepartment of Health &amp; Social  Services, 716 F.2d 1167,  1171\n                                       \n\n(7th  Cir.  1983).     There  is  no  fundamental  right   to\n\nrecreational  activities,  and Oropallo  makes  no allegation\n\nthat race, religion or the like were at work here.  \n\n     Finally, we  address plaintiff's retaliation claim.   It\n\nis  well  established that  conduct  which  is not  otherwise\n\nconstitutionally deficient is actionable under   1983 if done\n\nin retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected\n\nfirst amendment freedoms.   See Ferranti  v. Moran, 618  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n                             -9-\n\n888,   892   n.4  (1st   Cir.  1980)   (\"[A]ctions  otherwise\n\nsupportable lose  their legitimacy  if designed to  punish or\n\ndeter  an exercise  of  constitutional freedoms.\");  see also\n                                                             \n\nGoff  v.  Burton, 7  F.3d 734,  738  (8th Cir.  1993) (prison\n                \n\nofficials  cannot  lawfully  impose  a  disciplinary sanction\n\nagainst a prisoner in retaliation for the prisoner's exercise\n\nof  his constitutional right).  In McDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n16,  18 (1st Cir. 1979), we held that an inmate's allegations\n\nthat he  was transferred to another prison in retaliation for\n\nhaving  earlier  filed   actions  against  prison   officials\n\nsufficed to state a cause of action. \n\n     However,   even  if   we  construe   Oropallo's  amended\n\ncomplaint  liberally  to  include  his  later  allegation  of\n\nretaliation, we think his complaint  falls short of stating a\n\ncause of action.  In contrast to Ferranti and McDonald, where\n                                                      \n\nwe  found that the allegations  were sufficient, it cannot be\n\nsaid that Oropallo has set forth a chronology of events which\n\nwarrants  an inference  of retaliation.    See  Ferranti, 618\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 892  (inference  of retaliation  warranted from  the\n\nchronology  of events  recited and  from the  allegation that\n\nappellant's first suit complains  of prison conditions and is\n\ndirected  at  prison officials);  McDonald,  610  F.2d at  18\n                                          \n\n(chronology  of  events  provided  support  for inference  of\n\nretaliation).    Admittedly,  Oropallo  does  detail  in  his\n\ncomplaint various  lawsuits he  has filed directed  at prison\n\n                             -10-\n\nofficials.  However, it  is unclear, based on  the complaint,\n\nwhether any of Oropallo's  lawsuits antedates the decision to\n\nban  him from  the North  Yard area  of the  prison and  from\n\nparticipating  in recreational  activities.   If the  ban was\n\nimposed   prior  to   the  lawsuits,   Oropallo's   claim  of\n\nretaliation is seemingly without basis.\n\n     Although we  are persuaded  that Oropallo has  failed to\n\nstate a claim for  retaliation, the defect is one  that might\n\neasily be cured by amendment.  In light of appellant's pro se\n\nstatus, and because the  district court did not  address this\n\nclaim,  we  think the  dismissal  should  be  modified to  be\n\nwithout prejudice to the  plaintiff's filing a second amended\n\ncomplaint   realleging  this   claim.     Furthermore,  since\n\nappellant's pendent state claims were not addressed below, he\n\nshould be permitted to reallege these claims.   The dismissal\n\nof plaintiff's remaining claims is affirmed with prejudice.  \n\n     Affirmed as modified.   \n                         \n\n                             -11-\n",

Oropallo, a New Hampshire inmate, appeals pro se from the dismissal of his amended civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim.  For the reasons stated below, we modify the dismissal in part, and, otherwise, affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 1993, appellant filed an in forma pauperis complaint in the district court alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983, 1985 against various prison employees and officials, as well as against two fellow inmates.  The complaint also included two pendent state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts were alleged by Oropallo, and we assume for purposes of this opinion that they are true.  In early 1991, defendant Viola Lunderville, Administrator of Security, terminated appellant from his job at the prison recreation department.  Appellant filed a civil suit regarding this termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In April 1991, approximately six weeks after terminating appellant from his job, Lunderville allegedly conspired with defendant Richard L. Parrish, a prison official, to fabricate charges against appellant.  Parrish subsequently authored a false disciplinary report stating that he had received information from two inmates leading him to search appellant's hobby craft locker where Parrish found state property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After what Oropallo alleges was a sham disciplinary hearing, he was found guilty of unlawful possession of state property.  The guilty finding was upheld by defendant Michael Cunningham, the prison warden, and defendant Ronald Powell, Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.  Thereafter, Oropallo filed a civil suit challenging the disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since April 1991, and in connection with the \"fabricated\" charge, Oropallo allegedly has been banned from entering the North Yard area of the prison.  Defendants Donald G. Robb and George R. Sasser, both prison employees, have allegedly participated in banning him from this area.  Oropallo avers that he has been denied use of the prison gymnasium, hobby craft shop, North Yard ball field and attendance at a jazz concert and a power lifting event.  Oropallo further avers that this \"punishment\" is in excess of that normally handed down for disciplinary violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1992, Oropallo made inquiries of various prison officials, including defendant Powell, regarding his being banned from the North Yard area of the prison.  Several days later, appellant's typewriter and legal papers were confiscated by defendant Loran Ackerman, a prison official.  Appellant filed a civil suit contesting the confiscation of his legal materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these facts, the complaint alleged a violation of Oropallo's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, citing the Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Oropallo has been unconstitutionally subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint was initially referred to a magistrate judge (hereinafter, magistrate) who reviewed it prior to completing service.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d);   Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327-28 (1989) (to avoid wasteful litigation, under Sec. 1915(d) the court may dismiss claims which are based on indisputably meritless legal theories or delusional factual scenarios).  The magistrate concluded that Oropallo's \"claims concerning attendance at the jazz concert and special event and use of the hobby craft shop and ball field are frivolous,\" and that his claim concerning deprivation of exercise is insufficient to make out an actionable constitutional violation.  The magistrate granted Oropallo thirty days in which to amend his complaint or face a recommendation of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo filed an amended complaint which restated his Sec. 1983 causes of action as claims for harassment, constituting cruel and unusual punishment, and discrimination, in violation of his rights to due process and equal protection.  The amended complaint was otherwise identical to the original complaint.  Oropallo did not aver that the alleged discrimination was directed towards him as a member of a particular class, or offer any other reason for the alleged disparate treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing Oropallo's amended complaint, the magistrate recommended that the complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   See Forte v. Sullivan, 935 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (a district court may sua sponte dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint for failure to state a claim following notice and an opportunity to amend in a manner that would satisfy the procedural safeguards of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).  In support of his recommendation, the magistrate stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his original complaint, plaintiff alleged that he had been deprived of certain recreational activities.  Plaintiff was ordered to amend his complaint to state facts that show an indefinite limitation on exercise that could be harmful to his health.  However, the amended complaint does no more than repeat the conclusory allegations of plaintiff's initial complaint, namely, that he has been deprived of \"various recreational activities.\"  Amended Complaint at paras. 29, and 30.  Thus, the court finds that plaintiff has failed to show that he has suffered any constitutional deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo filed a timely objection in which he disavowed ever making a claim concerning lack of exercise, and argued that he had stated a valid claim for harassment and discrimination in violation of Sec. 1983.  In his objection, Oropallo, for the first time, articulated a motive for the alleged discrimination.  Oropallo stated that he was being discriminated against in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment right to file complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reviewed the matter, and approved the magistrate's report without stating additional reasons.  Judgment of dismissal entered on August 12, 1993.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo argues that his amended complaint should not have been dismissed because it states valid claims under Sec. 1983 for violations of his constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, to equal protection, to procedural due process, and to petition the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant was placed on notice of the inadequacy of his complaint and has had an opportunity to amend, we construe the dismissal of his amended complaint for failure to state a claim as a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.  See Guglielmo v.  Cunningham, 811 F. Supp. 31 (D.N.H. 1993).  Appellate review of a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary.  See, e.g., Miranda v.  Ponce Fed.  Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).  The standard for assessing the adequacy of a civil rights claim is whether, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construing these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleading shows any fact which could entitle the plaintiff to relief.   See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 1161-63 (1993);   Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).  Because appellant appears pro se, we read his complaint with an extra degree of solicitude.  Rodi v.  Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo's procedural due process claim is far from clear.  The disciplinary hearing that appellant claims was a sham is the subject of an independent complaint, and he disavows any intent to challenge that proceeding in the instant amended complaint.  Instead, appellant's theory appears to be that since the deprivations he complains of were not imposed as sanctions following this disciplinary hearing, or following any other hearing, they were unconstitutionally imposed without any process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim, however, must fail if there is no liberty interest in the activities he alleges he has been denied.  See,  e.g., Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454 (1989) (holding that visitation privileges could be suspended without hearing where no liberty interest in receiving visitors existed).  Appellant has abandoned any allegation that he has been deprived of adequate exercise, and the Constitution does not create an enforceable interest in recreational programs designed to relieve the boredom of prison life.  Although liberty interests may be rooted in state law, none of the prison rules invoked by the appellant could conceivably be interpreted as creating an entitlement to recreation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not devote much attention to Oropallo's Eighth Amendment claim.  The deprivations Oropallo complains of are not sufficiently weighty to implicate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.   See Hudson v. McMillian, 112 S. Ct. 995, 1000 (1992) (stating that only those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's claim that he has been denied equal protection because prison officials imposed harsher sanctions on him than on others \"similarly situated\" also fails.  A person bringing an action under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must either show a violation of a fundamental right or \"intentional discrimination against him because of his membership in a particular class, not merely that he was treated unfairly as an individual.\"   Huebschen v. Department of Health &amp; Social Services, 716 F.2d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir. 1983).  There is no fundamental right to recreational activities, and Oropallo makes no allegation that race, religion or the like were at work here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address plaintiff's retaliation claim.  It is well established that conduct which is not otherwise constitutionally deficient is actionable under Sec. 1983 if done in retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected first amendment freedoms.   See Ferranti v. Moran, 618 F.2d 888, 892 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"[A]ctions otherwise supportable lose their legitimacy if designed to punish or deter an exercise of constitutional freedoms.\");   see also Goff v. Burton, 7 F.3d 734, 738 (8th Cir. 1993) (prison officials cannot lawfully impose a disciplinary sanction against a prisoner in retaliation for the prisoner's exercise of his constitutional right).  In  McDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1979), we held that an inmate's allegations that he was transferred to another prison in retaliation for having earlier filed actions against prison officials sufficed to state a cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, even if we construe Oropallo's amended complaint liberally to include his later allegation of retaliation, we think his complaint falls short of stating a cause of action.  In contrast to Ferranti and McDonald, where we found that the allegations were sufficient, it cannot be said that Oropallo has set forth a chronology of events which warrants an inference of retaliation.  See Ferranti, 618 F.2d at 892 (inference of retaliation warranted from the chronology of events recited and from the allegation that appellant's first suit complains of prison conditions and is directed at prison officials);   McDonald, 610 F.2d at 18 (chronology of events provided support for inference of retaliation).  Admittedly, Oropallo does detail in his complaint various lawsuits he has filed directed at prison officials.  However, it is unclear, based on the complaint, whether any of Oropallo's lawsuits antedates the decision to ban him from the North Yard area of the prison and from participating in recreational activities.  If the ban was imposed prior to the lawsuits, Oropallo's claim of retaliation is seemingly without basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are persuaded that Oropallo has failed to state a claim for retaliation, the defect is one that might easily be cured by amendment.  In light of appellant's pro se status, and because the district court did not address this claim, we think the dismissal should be modified to be without prejudice to the plaintiff's filing a second amended complaint realleging this claim.  Furthermore, since appellant's pendent state claims were not addressed below, he should be permitted to reallege these claims.  The dismissal of plaintiff's remaining claims is affirmed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed as modified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint does not state when this suit was filed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint alleges that these two inmate informants, identified as defendants John Doe # 1 and John Doe # 2, conspired with Parrish to deprive appellant of his civil rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the complaint is far from clear on this point, it appears that the ban from entering the North Yard area of the prison and from participating in recreational activities was imposed prior to the disciplinary hearing.  The ban is allegedly still in effect.  It appears from Oropallo's brief that the sanctions imposed following the disciplinary hearing and guilty finding were suspended loss of good time and suspended punitive segregation time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The magistrate did not state whether this dismissal was intended to be pursuant to Sec. 1915(d) or Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Oropallo does not raise on appeal the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 claim and it is, therefore, deemed waived.  Even if we were to address this issue, we would hold that this claim was properly dismissed.  Appellant does not specify the subsection of Sec. 1985 upon which he relies.  However, the complaint can only conceivably be construed as asserting a claim under Sec. 1985(3) which prohibits conspiracies to interfere with the civil rights of individuals.  As so construed, the complaint fails to state a cause of action because plaintiff does not allege that defendants' actions were directed at a protected class.   See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 113 S. Ct. 753 (1993)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo argues that his amended complaint should not have been dismissed because it states valid claims under Sec. 1983 for violations of his constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, to equal protection, to procedural due process, and to petition the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant was placed on notice of the inadequacy of his complaint and has had an opportunity to amend, we construe the dismissal of his amended complaint for failure to state a claim as a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.  See Guglielmo v.  Cunningham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006664/guglielmo-v-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span> (D.N.H. 1993).  Appellate review of a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary.  See, e.g., Miranda v.  Ponce Fed.  Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571255\"><a href=\"/opinion/571255/clarissa-miranda-aka-clarissa-miranda-rodriguez-v-ponce-federal-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).  The standard for assessing the adequacy of a civil rights claim is whether, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construing these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleading shows any fact which could entitle the plaintiff to relief.   See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1161-63 (1993);   Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).  Because appellant appears pro se, we read his complaint with an extra degree of solicitude.  Rodi v.  Ventetuolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566305\"><a href=\"/opinion/566305/stephen-gerard-rodi-v-donald-r-ventetuolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oropallo's procedural due process claim is far from clear.  The disciplinary hearing that appellant claims was a sham is the subject of an independent complaint, and he disavows any intent to challenge that proceeding in the instant amended complaint.  Instead, appellant's theory appears to be that since the deprivations he complains of were not imposed as sanctions following this disciplinary hearing, or following any other hearing, they were unconstitutionally imposed without any process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim, however, must fail if there is no liberty interest in the activities he alleges he has been denied.  See,  e.g., Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112260\"><a href=\"/opinion/112260/kentucky-dept-of-corrections-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span> (1989) (holding that visitation privileges could be suspended without hearing where no liberty interest in receiving visitors existed).  Appellant has abandoned any allegation that he has been deprived of adequate exercise, and the Constitution does not create an enforceable interest in recreational programs designed to relieve the boredom of prison life.  Although liberty interests may be rooted in state law, none of the prison rules invoked by the appellant could conceivably be interpreted as creating an entitlement to recreation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not devote much attention to Oropallo's Eighth Amendment claim.  The deprivations Oropallo complains of are not sufficiently weighty to implicate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.   See Hudson v. McMillian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span>, 1000 (1992) (stating that only those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's claim that he has been denied equal protection because prison officials imposed harsher sanctions on him than on others \"similarly situated\" also fails.  A person bringing an action under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must either show a violation of a fundamental right or \"intentional discrimination against him because of his membership in a particular class, not merely that he was treated unfairly as an individual.\"   Huebschen v. Department of Health &amp; Social Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424717\"><a href=\"/opinion/424717/32-fair-emplpraccas-1582-32-empl-prac-dec-p-33812-david-huebschen/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span>, 1171 (7th Cir. 1983).  There is no fundamental right to recreational activities, and Oropallo makes no allegation that race, religion or the like were at work here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address plaintiff's retaliation claim.  It is well established that conduct which is not otherwise constitutionally deficient is actionable under Sec. 1983 if done in retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected first amendment freedoms.   See Ferranti v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376821\"><a href=\"/opinion/376821/david-r-ferranti-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 892 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"[A]ctions otherwise supportable lose their legitimacy if designed to punish or deter an exercise of constitutional freedoms.\");   see also Goff v. Burton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></span>, 738 (8th Cir. 1993) (prison officials cannot lawfully impose a disciplinary sanction against a prisoner in retaliation for the prisoner's exercise of his constitutional right).  In  McDonald v. Hall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371947\"><a href=\"/opinion/371947/anthony-f-mcdonald-v-frank-a-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1979), we held that an inmate's allegations that he was transferred to another prison in retaliation for having earlier filed actions against prison officials sufficed to state a cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, even if we construe Oropallo's amended complaint liberally to include his later allegation of retaliation, we think his complaint falls short of stating a cause of action.  In contrast to Ferranti and McDonald, where we found that the allegations were sufficient, it cannot be said that Oropallo has set forth a chronology of events which warrants an inference of retaliation.  See Ferranti, 618 F.2d at 892 (inference of retaliation warranted from the chronology of events recited and from the allegation that appellant's first suit complains of prison conditions and is directed at prison officials);   McDonald, 610 F.2d at 18 (chronology of events provided support for inference of retaliation).  Admittedly, Oropallo does detail in his complaint various lawsuits he has filed directed at prison officials.  However, it is unclear, based on the complaint, whether any of Oropallo's lawsuits antedates the decision to ban him from the North Yard area of the prison and from participating in recreational activities.  If the ban was imposed prior to the lawsuits, Oropallo's claim of retaliation is seemingly without basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are persuaded that Oropallo has failed to state a claim for retaliation, the defect is one that might easily be cured by amendment.  In light of appellant's pro se status, and because the district court did not address this claim, we think the dismissal should be modified to be without prejudice to the plaintiff's filing a second amended complaint realleging this claim.  Furthermore, since appellant's pendent state claims were not addressed below, he should be permitted to reallege these claims.  The dismissal of plaintiff's remaining claims is affirmed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed as modified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint does not state when this suit was filed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint alleges that these two inmate informants, identified as defendants John Doe # 1 and John Doe # 2, conspired with Parrish to deprive appellant of his civil rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the complaint is far from clear on this point, it appears that the ban from entering the North Yard area of the prison and from participating in recreational activities was imposed prior to the disciplinary hearing.  The ban is allegedly still in effect.  It appears from Oropallo's brief that the sanctions imposed following the disciplinary hearing and guilty finding were suspended loss of good time and suspended punitive segregation time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The magistrate did not state whether this dismissal was intended to be pursuant to Sec. 1915(d) or Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Oropallo does not raise on appeal the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 claim and it is, therefore, deemed waived.  Even if we were to address this issue, we would hold that this claim was properly dismissed.  Appellant does not specify the subsection of Sec. 1985 upon which he relies.  However, the complaint can only conceivably be construed as asserting a claim under Sec. 1985(3) which prohibits conspiracies to interfere with the civil rights of individuals.  As so construed, the complaint fails to state a cause of action because plaintiff does not allege that defendants' actions were directed at a protected class.   See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
