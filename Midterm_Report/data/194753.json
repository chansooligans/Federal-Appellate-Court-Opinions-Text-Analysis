On the other  hand, we will not\n\ncredit \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsup-\n\nported speculation.\"  Medina-Munoz  v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,\n                                                                \n\n896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                2\n\nA.   The Town\n             \n\n          Nahant,  Massachusetts, is  a municipality  of approxi-\n\nmately 4,200 people,  located north  of Boston.   Under the  Town\n\nCharter,  a three-member Board of  Selectmen serves as the \"chief\n\npolicymaking  agency of  the  town.\"   Selectmen serve  staggered\n\nthree-year terms; one  seat on  the Board is  filled by  election\n\neach year.\n\n          Among  their other  duties, the  Selectmen are  charged\n\nwith  appointing a  Superintendent of  Public Works  (hereinafter\n\n\"Superintendent\"), whose duties are defined in the Town Charter:\n\n          He  shall  administer, under  the supervision\n          and  direction of the Selectmen, a Department\n          of Public Works and the highway, water,  sew-\n          er,   cemetery,   tree   warden  and   health\n          departments.  He shall also administer, under\n          the supervision and  direction of the Select-\n          men,  such other departments  under their su-\n          pervision  as  the  Selectmen may  designate,\n          except  the fire  and  police.   He shall  be\n          responsible  for  the  administration of  all\n          departments within the scope of his duty, and\n          shall hold office subject  to the will of the\n          Selectmen.  He  shall be specially fitted  by\n          education, training and experience to perform\n          the duties of said office. . . .   During his\n          tenure, he  shall hold  no other  elective or\n          appointive  office, nor  shall be  engaged in\n          any other business  or occupation. . . .  and\n          shall, subject to the approval of the Select-\n          men,  appoint  such  assistants,  agents  and\n          employees as the performance of the duties of\n          the various departments under his supervision\n          may require.\n\nThe  job description for the position notes that it is \"performed\n\nwith  professional  independence  and considerable  latitude  for\n\nindependent  administrative  judgment\" and  that  \"[e]rrors could\n\nresult in major loss of  time and expenses.\"  It also  notes that\n\n                                3\n\nthe Superintendent \"makes frequent  contacts with other officials\n\nand the  general public.\"  Commensurate  with these responsibili-\n\nties, the    Superintendent  receives  a salary  of  $41,286;  by\n\ncomparison, the Nahant  Police Chief and  Nahant Fire Chief  each\n\nreceive  $41,365, and  the Nahant  Superintendent of  Schools re-\n\nceives $48,000.  Lower level salaries in the Department of Public\n\nWorks [\"Department\"] range from  $20,000-$24,000 for laborers  to\n\n$31,000-35,000 for foremen.\n\nB.   O'Connor's Appointment\n                           \n\n          Prior to 1989, Robert Steeves served as Superintendent.\n\nThe  Town's  three Selectmen  at  the time  were  Jayne Solomine,\n\nRichard Lombard, and Charles Kelley.  In February 1989, following\n\nKelley's death,  Steeves was elected  to the Board  of Selectmen,\n\ntriggering  a  search  for  a replacement  Superintendent.    The\n\nposition  was advertised  as requiring  \"an associates  degree in\n\ncivil engineering or five years experience in related engineering\n\nfields.\"\n\n          Although O'Connor had no engineering degree, he submit-\n\nted  an application  for the  position.   O'Connor had  worked in\n\nconstruction prior to 1963; then as a foreman in a local manufac-\n\nturing plant;  then, following  his retirement, in  various posi-\n\ntions  for  the  Rynn  Corporation,  a  family-owned construction\n\ncompany.  More to  the present point, perhaps, O'Connor  had been\n\nactive in  the Solomine, Kelley, and  Lombard election campaigns,\n\nhaving headed  Solomine's initial  campaign for public  office in\n\n1983.   On July 20, 1989, O'Connor  was appointed Superintendent,\n\n                                4\n\nby  a  2-1  vote, with  Lombard  and  Solomine  voting in  favor.\n\nSteeves voted against the  appointment, stating that O'Connor was\n\nunqualified and had been appointed because of his  connections to\n\nthe Lombard and Solomine election campaigns.\n\nC.   Steeves and O'Connor\n                         \n\n          Notwithstanding  O'Connor's appointment  as Superinten-\n\ndent, Steeves  continued his hands-on involvement  in the Depart-\n\nment,  dealing  with  vendors,  directing  personnel,  and making\n\nvarious small  purchases on  the Department's account.   O'Connor\n\nbelieved  that  Steeves'   continuing  involvement   \"undermined\"\n\nO'Connor's authority within the  Department, and on several occa-\n\nsions in late 1989 O'Connor  told Steeves he should stay  \"out of\n\ndoing my job.\"  At around the same time, O'Connor became aware of\n\nSteeves' practice  of purchasing  goods for personal  use through\n\nthe Department account, which was not subject to the 5% Massachu-\n\nsetts sales  tax.  Although  Steeves later repaid  the Department\n\nfor  these purchases, the record does not indicate that the sales\n\ntax was ever paid.  After discussing the matter with Town Accoun-\n\ntant  Joseph  Canty, O'Connor  concluded  that  the practice  was\n\nimproper,  and asked  Steeves  to stop  \"so  we could  have  some\n\naccountability through the financial system and all these invoic-\n\nes and everything else.\"  Steeves did not respond.\n\n          When  his  approaches to  Steeves  proved unsuccessful,\n\nO'Connor  complained to  Selectmen  Lombard  and  Solomine  about\n\nSteeves' conduct,  including the  improper use of  the Department\n\naccount.   In January or February 1990, O'Connor wrote the Board,\n\n                                5\n\ndetailing  his  complaints about  Steeves'  purchasing practices.\n\nThe  letter was  discussed at  a \"public  meeting\" of  some kind,\n\nalthough O'Connor is not  sure whether any members of  the public\n\nwere in attendance.  Selectman Lombard told Steeves to stop using\n\nthe Department account, and  wrote all department heads directing\n\nthem to  instruct employees not to charge purchases on department\n\naccounts without authorization.  In response to Lombard's letter,\n\nO'Connor drafted an internal memorandum  prohibiting unauthorized\n\npurchases  on the  Department account.  The memorandum had little\n\nnoticeable  effect.   Steeves continued  to charge  personal pur-\n\nchases on the Department account.\n\n          In March 1990, O'Connor addressed another memorandum to\n\nthe Board, again  describing Steeves' personal use of the Depart-\n\nment  account, and  requesting that  these practices  be stopped.\n\nLombard read the memorandum  at another Board meeting and  issued\n\nSteeves another warning, but apparently Steeves did not terminate\n\nthe  practice.  The various disputes between O'Connor and Steeves\n\nled to increased friction  within the Department.  By  the spring\n\nof 1990,  as all parties concede, the  Department's employees had\n\ndivided  into two factions, which communicated poorly, apparently\n\non unfriendly terms.\n\n2.   The Town Water Crisis\n                          \n\n          In  late March  1990,  shortly before  the annual  Town\n\nelection, larger events temporarily  distracted the parties  from\n\nthe dispute  over Steeves' purchasing practices,  and caused them\n\nto focus instead  on the breakdown  of communications within  the\n\n                                6\n\nDepartment.  Three consecutive readings of the Town water  supply\n\nrevealed  bacterial contamination;  under Massachusetts  law, the\n\nDepartment was  required to notify  the public and  the Massachu-\n\nsetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"), and to take\n\nsteps  to safeguard the Town water supply.  O'Connor was notified\n\nof  the contamination  during a  family emergency, and  called on\n\nSteeves  to  take charge  of notifying  the  DEP.   Steeves later\n\ninsisted  that  he  promised  O'Connor  no  specific  assistance.\n\nPhillip Applin, a Department employee, testified that although he\n\nprovided information  to Steeves at O'Connor's  direction, he did\n\nso with hesitation, \"because  Mr. Steeves was not supposed  to be\n\ninvolved with bothering the Public Works employees.\"  Applin also\n\ntestified  that, as late as  April 6, 1990,  O'Connor and Steeves\n\nobviously had not yet spoken to each other  about whether the DEP\n\nhad  been notified.  Apparently  as a result  of the breakdown in\n\ncommunications between the parties, neither DEP  nor the Town was\n\nnotified about the  contamination for several days, and  a number\n\nof Town residents became seriously ill.\n\n          The  perceived mishandling  of the  water contamination\n\nproblem  generated considerable public controversy, and became an\n\nimportant  factor in the April, 1990  elections.  Selectman Jayne\n\nSolomine, who supported O'Connor,  was replaced by Harry Edwards,\n\na Steeves supporter.   Edwards later stated that  he had been ap-\n\nproached,  prior  to  the  election, by  voters  concerned  about\n\nO'Connor's performance during the Town water  crisis, and that he\n\nviewed his election  as a  mandate to remove  O'Connor as  Super-\n\n                                7\n\nintendent.\n\nD.   O'Connor's Termination\n                           \n\n          Following Edwards' election and  the correction of  the\n\nwater  contamination  problem,  O'Connor resumed  his  complaints\n\nabout  Steeves' unauthorized  purchasing  practices.   In May  or\n\nJune, O'Connor  presented the  Board with  another invoice  for a\n\npersonal purchase by Steeves on the Department account.  O'Connor\n\nalso approached  Edwards, the  new Selectman, seeking  to discuss\n\nSteeves' misuse  of Department accounts.   Edwards appeared unin-\n\nterested.\n\n          At a Board  meeting on May 24,  1990, Lombard moved  to\n\nreappoint O'Connor as Superintendent; Edwards and Steeves blocked\n\nthe motion.  On  June 28, 1990, Lombard again moved  to reappoint\n\nO'Connor, but once  again Edwards and  Steeves blocked the  reap-\n\npointment.  Edwards  then moved to terminate  O'Connor, but with-\n\ndrew the  motion without explanation.   On July 12,  1990, O'Con-\n\nnor's termination again came  up for a  Board vote.  Just  before\n\nthe  vote, O'Connor  left the  meeting, went  to his  office, and\n\nreturned with  a number of Department invoices signed by Steeves,\n\nthen proceeded to describe Steeves' improper  conduct to those in\n\nattendance,  stating that he wanted the townspeople to know \"what\n\nwas really going on in the city hall.\"1\n\n                    \n\n     1O'Connor  apparently succeeded  in piquing  public interest\nabout  Steeves'  purchasing  practices.     Following  O'Connor's\ntermination, the  Essex  County District  Attorney requested  \"an\naudit of  the Town's  procurement policies, practices  and proce-\ndures.\"   The State Auditor ultimately identified 32 purchases of\ngoods     totalling  approximately  $2600     by individuals  for\n\n                                8\n\n          Lombard voted against  O'Connor's termination;  Edwards\n\nand Steeves  voted in favor.  Edwards later said he voted to ter-\n\nminate O'Connor because  of the  \"mandate\" he had  been given  by\n\nvoters after the Town water crisis.  Steeves later stated that he\n\nvoted  to terminate  O'Connor because  of O'Connor's  alleged in-\n\nvolvement  in Solomine's unsuccessful reelection bid, and because\n\nO'Connor allegedly had told a Department employee not to vote for\n\nEdwards during  the April 1990 elections,  which O'Connor denies.\n\nIn August, 1990, O'Connor sued, alleging, inter alia, that he had\n                                                    \n\nbeen discharged in retaliation for his political affiliation with\n\nSolomine, and for his accusations against Steeves.2\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   Political Discharge\n                        \n\n          A public  employee may  not be discharged,  demoted, or\n\ndisciplined for political activities or beliefs, unless political\n\naffiliation or belief is an appropriate job qualification for the\n\nparticular position.  See Rutan v. Republican Party of  Illinois,\n                                                                \n\n497 U.S. 62 (1990); Branti v.

The audit noted  that \"the practice of  allowing\nindividuals to  purchase items through  the town is  improper, if\nnot illegal,  and holds the town  at risk of paying  for any pur-\nchases that are not identified as personal purchases.\"  The audit\ndid not  identify the individuals responsible  for these improper\npurchases.\n\n     2The  district  court  dismissed  O'Connor's  various  other\nclaims  under federal and state law on the merits.  O'Connor does\nnot challenge those dismissals.\n\n                                9\n\nv.  Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976).

Chicago's population is  approximately 2.8 million;\nNahant's approximately 4,200.  Chicago's annual budget is approx-\nimately $3.2 billion; Nahant's approximately  $4 million.  We  do\nnot think governmental provision  of essential public services is\nany  the less  prone  to politicization  in smaller  communities;\nmunicipal services  are as essential to  the few as to  the many.\nIn light of the broader scope of the public services it provides,\nwe  think the  role of the  Department in  the political  life of\nNahant  is at least comparable to that of the Water Department in\n                   \nChicago.

Analyzing the \"content,  form and\ncontext\" of  the employee's  statements, the Supreme  Court noted\nthat  the employee \"did  not seek to  inform the public  that the\nDistrict Attorney's office was  not discharging its  governmental\nresponsibilities  . . .

The  separate\n                                     \ntreatment  given the one item of \"inherent public concern\" on the\nemployee  questionnaire is  consistent  with our  exempting  such\nclear  First  Amendment  speech  from  the  full-scale  threshold\ninquiry into  the employee's  motives in speaking,  undertaken in\nConnick in relation to the other items on the questionnaire.

Rankin  concerned a law  enforcement employee's\n                        \nprivate  comment to a co-worker,  in the aftermath  of the assas-\nsination attempt against President  Reagan:  \"if they go  for him\nagain, I hope  they get him.\"  483 U.S. at  381.  The Court found\nthat the statement, in  context, \"plainly dealt with a  matter of\n                               \npublic concern,\"  insofar  as it  \"came on  the heels  of a  news\nbulletin  regarding  what is  certainly  a  matter of  heightened\npublic attention:  an attempt on the life of the President.\"  Id.\n                                                                \nat 386 (emphasis  added).  The Court paid little attention to the\n\"form  and context\"  of McPherson's  statement, insofar  as those\nfactors  bore on her motives  for speaking; indeed,  if the Court\n                            \nhad  done so,  it probably  would have  found that  the statement\n(which apparently  occurred without  premeditation, in  a private\nconversation between  co-workers) was  motivated by little  or no\ncivic concern to inform the public on any relevant issue.  Rankin\n                                                                 \nsuggests  that the  courts  are to  proceed  to the  second-stage\nPickering  inquiry  whenever public-employee  speech, objectively\n         \nviewed in  the context of  a broader public  discourse, addresses\n(with  reasonable  specificity)  an  issue  or  topic implicating\n                                                     \n\"core\" First Amendment concerns.\n\n                                22\n\ndirectly implicated a topic of inherent concern to the  community\n\n   official misconduct  by an incumbent elected  official.  Given\n\ntheir direct bearing on Steeves' fitness for elective  office, we\n\nthink   O'Connor's  allegations  of  improper  purchases  clearly\n\nconstituted a matter of  legitimate public concern, obviating the\n\nneed for a threshold analysis of his dominant motive for speaking\n\nout  on these issues.6  Accordingly, we reject the Town's conten-\n\ntions, based on the \"form and context\" of O'Connor's speech, that\n\nO'Connor's personal motives should result  in the denial of First\n\nAmendment protection  at the threshold.  Cf.  Pickering, 391 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 572 (recognizing  that government employees \"are,  as a class,\n\nthe  members  of a  community most  likely  to have  informed and\n\n                    \n\n     6The district  court noted that the  summary judgment record\nincluded only  five Department invoices signed  by Steeves during\nthe  entire period in  question, representing cumulative personal\npurchases amounting to approximately $500, on which a total state\nsales tax approximating  $20-25 would  have been due.   Based  on\nthese small sums,  and the  fact that Steeves  repaid the  monies\nexpended by the Department,  the district court considered Steev-\nes'  alleged  misconduct de  minimis.    Given  their bearing  on\n                                    \nSteeves' fitness  for elective  office, these improper  purchases\nclearly pertained  to a matter  of legitimate public  interest to\nthe community.  If their  infrequency, modest amount, and  repay-\nment  tempered their  seriousness as  a reflection  upon Steeves'\nsuitability for elective office, that was a matter for the Nahant\nelectorate.

The Pickering Scale\n                        \n\n          As the content of  O'Connor's allegations was of inher-\n\nent \"public concern\" for First  Amendment purposes, we proceed to\n\nthe second test.  Under Pickering, we are required to balance the\n                                 \n\nsignificance  of  the  interests  served by  the  public-employee\n\nspeech     including the  employee's interests  in communicating,\n\nand the interests  of the community in receiving, information \"on\n\nmatters of public importance\"    against the governmental employ-\n\ner's legitimate  interests in preventing  unnecessary disruptions\n\nand inefficiencies  in carrying  out its public  service mission.\n\n391 U.S. at 568-575.  \n\n          We  note  at the  outset  that  O'Connor's motives  for\n\nspeaking out are properly weighed in the balance under Pickering.\n                                                                \n\nSee, e.g., Versarge v.  Township of Clinton, 984 F.2d  1359, 1366\n                                           \n\n(3d Cir.  1993) (according  \"little weight,\" under  Pickering, to\n                                                             \n\nplaintiff's  \"vengeful and  obstructionist interests  in speaking\n\nout on issue of public concern\").  Thus, insofar as self-interest\n\nis found to have motivated public-employee speech, the employee's\n\nexpression is entitled  to less weight  in the Pickering  balance\n                                                        \n\nthan  speech on matters of  public concern intended  to serve the\n\npublic  interest.  Id.   Furthermore, we agree  with the district\n                      \n\ncourt  that O'Connor's motives, prominently including the evident\n\nself-interest in  preserving his position as Superintendent, were\n\nless than altruistic.  \n\n          Nevertheless,  the  legitimate interest  of  the Town's\n\n                                24\n\nelectorate  in  the type  of  information  disclosed by  O'Connor\n\nrepresents  a public  benefit  entitled to  great  weight in  the\n\nPickering balance.  Id. (citing O'Donnell v. Yanchulis,  875 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1059,  1061 (3d Cir. 1989)) (\"On plaintiff's side of the balance,\n\nwe  must also consider the interests of the public in plaintiff's\n\nspeech\").    O'Connor's disclosures  concerned  alleged abuse  of\n\npublic  office on  the  part of  an  elected official,  a  matter\n\ntraditionally  occupying \"the  highest rung  of the  hierarchy of\n\nFirst Amendment values.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 145.7   The strong\n                                 \n\npublic interest in such disclosures  supplements O'Connor's rela-\n      \n\ntively slight personal interest  in speaking out, heavily weight-\n                      \n\ning the  Pickering scale in  favor of First  Amendment protection\n                  \n\nagainst retaliation for O'Connor's speech.8\n\n          On  the other side of the Pickering scale, the Town has\n                                             \n\nyet  to  demonstrate its  legitimate  interest,  as employer,  in\n                    \n\n                    \n\n     7See also,  e.g., Vasbinder v.  Ambach, 926 F.2d  1333, 1339\n                                           \n(2d Cir. 1991) (public  employee's Pickering interest is particu-\n                                            \nlarly  great where  speech  involves charges  of \"fraudulent  and\ncorrupt practices\"  or other \"unlawful conduct\"  by elected offi-\ncial); but cf. Breuer,  909 F.2d at 1041 (upholding  dismissal of\n                     \ndeputy  sheriff for  \"whistleblowing\"  on corruption  by sheriff,\nbased on  county's \"particularly  urgent need for  close teamwork\namong those involved in  the 'high stakes' field of  law enforce-\nment\") (citation omitted).\n\n     8It is  also  relevant that  O'Connor's factual  allegations\nabout Steeves' purchasing practices are essentially undisputed by\nthe  defendants.  We are not faced with  a case in which a public\nemployee has intentionally disseminated  false information.  Both\nsides of the Pickering balance might be significantly affected in\n                      \nsuch circumstances.  See Brasslett, 761 F.2d at 839 (\"an employer\n                                  \nhas a  greater interest  in curtailing erroneous  statements than\ncorrect ones, and still a greater interest in curtailing deliber-\nate falsehoods  . . . .  Correspondingly, an  employee's interest\nin  making public  statements  is heightened  according to  their\nveracity.\").\n\n                                25\n\ncurtailing the  specific disclosures which O'Connor  alleges were\n\nthe basis for his  termination.  Although the Town has shown con-\n\nsiderable disruption in  the Department  operations, and  serious\n\ndeterioration  in  the  working  relations  between O'Connor  and\n\nSteeves,  and their respective factions,  it has not  yet met its\n\nburden  of showing  that the  disruption was attributable  to the\n\nexercise of O'Connor's First Amendment right to speak out on this\n\nsubject,  so  as to  warrant  discharging  him on  speech-related\n\ngrounds.   On  the  contrary, the  disruption  which occurred  in\n\nDepartment operations  may as readily be  attributed to unrelated\n\nfactors:  for example,  to Steeves' allegedly unauthorized inter-\n\nference in  the Department operations.   See, e.g.,  Zamboni, 847\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 79 (\"in evaluating the disruption, if any, that resulted\n\nfrom [plaintiff's]  criticisms  . .  .  the district  court  must\n\nconsider whether  any unrest was  caused directly by  [the plain-\n\ntiff's]  speech  or whether  it  was  exacerbated by  defendants'\n\nactions\").  Notwithstanding O'Connor's status  as a \"policymaking\n\nor  confidential  employee,\" see  Kinsey  v.  Salado Indep.  Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nDist., 950 F.2d 988, 995 (5th Cir. 1992), whose position required\n     \n\nclose working  relations with  the Board of  Selectmen, including\n\nSteeves,  we cannot  assume, absent  some showing  by defendants,\n\nthat  the erosion of their working relationship was due to O'Con-\n\nnor's  protected  speech.    See Brasslett,  761  F.2d  at 845-46\n                                          \n\n(\"defendants must show  that . . .

As the  district\n\ncourt  properly noted,  O'Connor failed  on several  occasions to\n\npublicize his allegations of  Steeves' misconduct directly to the\n                                                          \n\ncommunity;  instead, he  chose to  direct his disclosures  to the\n\nBoard of Selectmen.9  Nevertheless, the  decision to disclose his\n\nallegations to the Board, rather than the community at large, did\n\nnot  eliminate O'Connor's  First Amendment  interest in  speaking\n\nout.  See, e.g., Givhan v.  Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist.,  439\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 410,  415-16 (1979) (employee retains  personal First Amend-\n\nment  right to  comment  on issues  of  public concern,  even  if\n\ncomments are made in private; \"[n]either the Amendment itself nor\n\nour decisions indicate that [the  right to speak out is] lost  to\n\nthe public  employee who  arranges to communicate  privately with\n\nhis employer rather than to spread his views before the public\");\n\nsee  also Rankin, 483 U.S.  at 378 (private  comment to co-worker\n                \n\nheld protected  under Pickering balance).   Moreover, in addition\n                               \n\nto controlling  O'Connor's employment, the Board  of Selectmen is\n\nthe Town's highest  elective body, with  representative responsi-\n\nbility for  acting in  the best  interests of  the  Town and  its\n\ncitizenry.   Hence,  O'Connor's  decision to  address the  Board,\n\n                    \n\n     9Although  O'Connor raised  allegations against  Steeves' at\nseveral \"public meetings\" prior to  July 1990, the district court\nnoted  that few,  if any,  members of  the public  attended these\nmeetings.  O'Connor also published several internal memoranda, on\nDepartment stationery, discussing misuse of  Department accounts,\nbut the memoranda did not mention Steeves.  \n\n                                27\n\nrather  than the community at large, was no mere private communi-\n\ncation,  nor did it in  any sense extinguish  the inherent public\n\ninterest  in  his disclosures  of Steeves'  alleged misconduct.10\n\nEverything  considered, and viewing the  record in the light most\n\nfavorable  to O'Connor, we are unable to conclude that the Town's\n\ninterest in suppressing  O'Connor's speech outweighed  the impor-\n\ntance  of the  legitimate public  interest in  O'Connor's disclo-\n\nsures.11\n\n                    \n\n     10Indeed,  a  public employee,  whose  disclosures have  the\npotential to disrupt the employing agency or department, may  act\nresponsibly by  taking steps  to minimize disruption  by limiting\ndissemination to the public authorities most  directly concerned.\nSee Rankin, 483 U.S. at 389 (noting that employee \"had [not] dis-\n          \ncredited the  office by making  her statement  in public,\"  where\noffensive remark  \"was evidently  made in a  private conversation\nwith another  employee\"); Hubbard  v.

Causation\n              \n\n          The Town  may have  reserved its strongest  defense for\n\nthe next round.   On the  record before us,  O'Connor would  have\n\ngrave difficulty  demonstrating that  the protected speech  was a\n\n\"substantial or motivating\" factor in his discharge by the  Town.\n\nMt.  Healthy,  429 U.S.  at 27412.    O'Connor's alleged  lack of\n            \n\nqualifications for  the Superintendent's position,  combined with\n\nthe  public concern  over the  Town water  crisis, may  well have\n\nprovided neutral,  non-speech related  reasons  for Edwards'  and\n\nSteeves' votes against O'Connor's retention.  Unless O'Connor can\n\npresent evidence  demonstrating that the discharge  was motivated\n\nby his protected speech, the Town may yet be entitled to judgment\n\n                    \n\nprecedent\").\n\n     12The  purpose of the Mt. Healthy test is to ensure that the\n                                      \nemployee is not placed\n\n          in a better position as a result of the exer-\n          cise  of  constitutionally protected  conduct\n          than  he would  have  occupied  had  he  done\n          nothing . . . . A borderline or marginal can-\n          didate  should not have  the employment ques-\n          tion  resolved against him because of consti-\n          tutionally protected conduct.   But that same\n          candidate ought not  to be able,  by engaging\n          in such conduct, to prevent his employer from\n          assessing his performance record and reaching\n          a decision not to rehire on the basis of that\n          record, simply because the  protected conduct\n          makes the  employer more certain  of the cor-\n          rectness of its decision.\n\n429 U.S.  at 285-86.  Here, O'Connor's last-minute public revela-\ntion  of Steeves'  purchasing  practices, at  the  July 10  Board\nmeeting, suggests the precise  situation which Mt. Healthy sought\n                                                          \nto avoid:   an effort  by O'Connor (when  his discharge  appeared\ninevitable)  to place himself \"in  a better position\"  to raise a\nlater constitutional challenge to his discharge.  \n\n                                29\n\nunder the  Mt.

We are not  in a position  to make\n                      \n\nthis  determination, however,  as the  Town assumed,  for summary\n\njudgment purposes, a causal link between the protected speech and\n\nO'Connor's subsequent discharge.\n\n                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          As  political affiliation  was an  appropriate qualifi-\n\ncation  for the Superintendent  position, we affirm  the grant of\n\nsummary judgment  for the Town on  O'Connor's political discharge\n\nclaim.

The Town\n             \n\n          Nahant,  Massachusetts, is  a municipality  of approxi-\n\nmately 4,200 people,  located north  of Boston.   Under the  Town\n\nCharter,  a three-member Board of  Selectmen serves as the \"chief\n\npolicymaking  agency of  the  town.\"   Selectmen serve  staggered\n\nthree-year terms; one  seat on  the Board is  filled by  election\n\neach year.\n\n          Among  their other  duties, the  Selectmen are  charged\n\nwith  appointing a  Superintendent of  Public Works  (hereinafter\n\n\"Superintendent\"), whose duties are defined in the Town Charter:\n\n          He  shall  administer, under  the supervision\n          and  direction of the Selectmen, a Department\n          of Public Works and the highway, water,  sew-\n          er,   cemetery,   tree   warden  and   health\n          departments.  He shall also administer, under\n          the supervision and  direction of the Select-\n          men,  such other departments  under their su-\n          pervision  as  the  Selectmen may  designate,\n          except  the fire  and  police.   He shall  be\n          responsible  for  the  administration of  all\n          departments within the scope of his duty, and\n          shall hold office subject  to the will of the\n          Selectmen.  He  shall be specially fitted  by\n          education, training and experience to perform\n          the duties of said office. . . .   During his\n          tenure, he  shall hold  no other  elective or\n          appointive  office, nor  shall be  engaged in\n          any other business  or occupation. . . .  and\n          shall, subject to the approval of the Select-\n          men,  appoint  such  assistants,  agents  and\n          employees as the performance of the duties of\n          the various departments under his supervision\n          may require.\n\nThe  job description for the position notes that it is \"performed\n\nwith  professional  independence  and considerable  latitude  for\n\nindependent  administrative  judgment\" and  that  \"[e]rrors could\n\nresult in major loss of  time and expenses.\"  It also  notes that\n\n                                3\n\nthe Superintendent \"makes frequent  contacts with other officials\n\nand the  general public.\"  Commensurate  with these responsibili-\n\nties, the    Superintendent  receives  a salary  of  $41,286;  by\n\ncomparison, the Nahant  Police Chief and  Nahant Fire Chief  each\n\nreceive  $41,365, and  the Nahant  Superintendent of  Schools re-\n\nceives $48,000.  Lower level salaries in the Department of Public\n\nWorks [\"Department\"] range from  $20,000-$24,000 for laborers  to\n\n$31,000-35,000 for foremen.\n\nB.   O'Connor's Appointment\n                           \n\n          Prior to 1989, Robert Steeves served as Superintendent.\n\nThe  Town's  three Selectmen  at  the time  were  Jayne Solomine,\n\nRichard Lombard, and Charles Kelley.  In February 1989, following\n\nKelley's death,  Steeves was elected  to the Board  of Selectmen,\n\ntriggering  a  search  for  a replacement  Superintendent.    The\n\nposition  was advertised  as requiring  \"an associates  degree in\n\ncivil engineering or five years experience in related engineering\n\nfields.\"\n\n          Although O'Connor had no engineering degree, he submit-\n\nted  an application  for the  position.   O'Connor had  worked in\n\nconstruction prior to 1963; then as a foreman in a local manufac-\n\nturing plant;  then, following  his retirement, in  various posi-\n\ntions  for  the  Rynn  Corporation,  a  family-owned construction\n\ncompany.  More to  the present point, perhaps, O'Connor  had been\n\nactive in  the Solomine, Kelley, and  Lombard election campaigns,\n\nhaving headed  Solomine's initial  campaign for public  office in\n\n1983.   On July 20, 1989, O'Connor  was appointed Superintendent,\n\n                                4\n\nby  a  2-1  vote, with  Lombard  and  Solomine  voting in  favor.\n\nSteeves voted against the  appointment, stating that O'Connor was\n\nunqualified and had been appointed because of his  connections to\n\nthe Lombard and Solomine election campaigns.\n\nC.   Steeves and O'Connor\n                         \n\n          Notwithstanding  O'Connor's appointment  as Superinten-\n\ndent, Steeves  continued his hands-on involvement  in the Depart-\n\nment,  dealing  with  vendors,  directing  personnel,  and making\n\nvarious small  purchases on  the Department's account.   O'Connor\n\nbelieved  that  Steeves'   continuing  involvement   \"undermined\"\n\nO'Connor's authority within the  Department, and on several occa-\n\nsions in late 1989 O'Connor  told Steeves he should stay  \"out of\n\ndoing my job.\"  At around the same time, O'Connor became aware of\n\nSteeves' practice  of purchasing  goods for personal  use through\n\nthe Department account, which was not subject to the 5% Massachu-\n\nsetts sales  tax.  Although  Steeves later repaid  the Department\n\nfor  these purchases, the record does not indicate that the sales\n\ntax was ever paid.  After discussing the matter with Town Accoun-\n\ntant  Joseph  Canty, O'Connor  concluded  that  the practice  was\n\nimproper,  and asked  Steeves  to stop  \"so  we could  have  some\n\naccountability through the financial system and all these invoic-\n\nes and everything else.\"  Steeves did not respond.\n\n          When  his  approaches to  Steeves  proved unsuccessful,\n\nO'Connor  complained to  Selectmen  Lombard  and  Solomine  about\n\nSteeves' conduct,  including the  improper use of  the Department\n\naccount.   In January or February 1990, O'Connor wrote the Board,\n\n                                5\n\ndetailing  his  complaints about  Steeves'  purchasing practices.\n\nThe  letter was  discussed at  a \"public  meeting\" of  some kind,\n\nalthough O'Connor is not  sure whether any members of  the public\n\nwere in attendance.  Selectman Lombard told Steeves to stop using\n\nthe Department account, and  wrote all department heads directing\n\nthem to  instruct employees not to charge purchases on department\n\naccounts without authorization.  In response to Lombard's letter,\n\nO'Connor drafted an internal memorandum  prohibiting unauthorized\n\npurchases  on the  Department account.  The memorandum had little\n\nnoticeable  effect.   Steeves continued  to charge  personal pur-\n\nchases on the Department account.\n\n          In March 1990, O'Connor addressed another memorandum to\n\nthe Board, again  describing Steeves' personal use of the Depart-\n\nment  account, and  requesting that  these practices  be stopped.\n\nLombard read the memorandum  at another Board meeting and  issued\n\nSteeves another warning, but apparently Steeves did not terminate\n\nthe  practice.  The various disputes between O'Connor and Steeves\n\nled to increased friction  within the Department.  By  the spring\n\nof 1990,  as all parties concede, the  Department's employees had\n\ndivided  into two factions, which communicated poorly, apparently\n\non unfriendly terms.\n\n2.   The Town Water Crisis\n                          \n\n          In  late March  1990,  shortly before  the annual  Town\n\nelection, larger events temporarily  distracted the parties  from\n\nthe dispute  over Steeves' purchasing practices,  and caused them\n\nto focus instead  on the breakdown  of communications within  the\n\n                                6\n\nDepartment.  Three consecutive readings of the Town water  supply\n\nrevealed  bacterial contamination;  under Massachusetts  law, the\n\nDepartment was  required to notify  the public and  the Massachu-\n\nsetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"), and to take\n\nsteps  to safeguard the Town water supply.  O'Connor was notified\n\nof  the contamination  during a  family emergency, and  called on\n\nSteeves  to  take charge  of notifying  the  DEP.   Steeves later\n\ninsisted  that  he  promised  O'Connor  no  specific  assistance.\n\nPhillip Applin, a Department employee, testified that although he\n\nprovided information  to Steeves at O'Connor's  direction, he did\n\nso with hesitation, \"because  Mr. Steeves was not supposed  to be\n\ninvolved with bothering the Public Works employees.\"  Applin also\n\ntestified  that, as late as  April 6, 1990,  O'Connor and Steeves\n\nobviously had not yet spoken to each other  about whether the DEP\n\nhad  been notified.  Apparently  as a result  of the breakdown in\n\ncommunications between the parties, neither DEP  nor the Town was\n\nnotified about the  contamination for several days, and  a number\n\nof Town residents became seriously ill.\n\n          The  perceived mishandling  of the  water contamination\n\nproblem  generated considerable public controversy, and became an\n\nimportant  factor in the April, 1990  elections.  Selectman Jayne\n\nSolomine, who supported O'Connor,  was replaced by Harry Edwards,\n\na Steeves supporter.   Edwards later stated that  he had been ap-\n\nproached,  prior  to  the  election, by  voters  concerned  about\n\nO'Connor's performance during the Town water  crisis, and that he\n\nviewed his election  as a  mandate to remove  O'Connor as  Super-\n\n                                7\n\nintendent.\n\nD.   O'Connor's Termination\n                           \n\n          Following Edwards' election and  the correction of  the\n\nwater  contamination  problem,  O'Connor resumed  his  complaints\n\nabout  Steeves' unauthorized  purchasing  practices.   In May  or\n\nJune, O'Connor  presented the  Board with  another invoice  for a\n\npersonal purchase by Steeves on the Department account.  O'Connor\n\nalso approached  Edwards, the  new Selectman, seeking  to discuss\n\nSteeves' misuse  of Department accounts.   Edwards appeared unin-\n\nterested.\n\n          At a Board  meeting on May 24,  1990, Lombard moved  to\n\nreappoint O'Connor as Superintendent; Edwards and Steeves blocked\n\nthe motion.  On  June 28, 1990, Lombard again moved  to reappoint\n\nO'Connor, but once  again Edwards and  Steeves blocked the  reap-\n\npointment.  Edwards  then moved to terminate  O'Connor, but with-\n\ndrew the  motion without explanation.   On July 12,  1990, O'Con-\n\nnor's termination again came  up for a  Board vote.  Just  before\n\nthe  vote, O'Connor  left the  meeting, went  to his  office, and\n\nreturned with  a number of Department invoices signed by Steeves,\n\nthen proceeded to describe Steeves' improper  conduct to those in\n\nattendance,  stating that he wanted the townspeople to know \"what\n\nwas really going on in the city hall.\"1\n\n                    \n\n     1O'Connor  apparently succeeded  in piquing  public interest\nabout  Steeves'  purchasing  practices.     Following  O'Connor's\ntermination, the  Essex  County District  Attorney requested  \"an\naudit of  the Town's  procurement policies, practices  and proce-\ndures.\"   The State Auditor ultimately identified 32 purchases of\ngoods     totalling  approximately  $2600     by individuals  for\n\n                                8\n\n          Lombard voted against  O'Connor's termination;  Edwards\n\nand Steeves  voted in favor.  Edwards later said he voted to ter-\n\nminate O'Connor because  of the  \"mandate\" he had  been given  by\n\nvoters after the Town water crisis.  Steeves later stated that he\n\nvoted  to terminate  O'Connor because  of O'Connor's  alleged in-\n\nvolvement  in Solomine's unsuccessful reelection bid, and because\n\nO'Connor allegedly had told a Department employee not to vote for\n\nEdwards during  the April 1990 elections,  which O'Connor denies.\n\nIn August, 1990, O'Connor sued, alleging, inter alia, that he had\n                                                    \n\nbeen discharged in retaliation for his political affiliation with\n\nSolomine, and for his accusations against Steeves.2\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   Political Discharge\n                        \n\n          A public  employee may  not be discharged,  demoted, or\n\ndisciplined for political activities or beliefs, unless political\n\naffiliation or belief is an appropriate job qualification for the\n\nparticular position.

We agree, and since we are  unable to\n\nconclude, on the present  record, that O'Connor's discharge could\n                                                                 \n\nnot  have resulted from his  protected speech (as  opposed to his\n   \n\nunprotected speech, or his job performance as Superintendent), we\n\nmust vacate the grant of summary judgment for the Town and remand\n\nto the district court for further proceedings.\n\n1.

Rankin  concerned a law  enforcement employee's\n                        \nprivate  comment to a co-worker,  in the aftermath  of the assas-\nsination attempt against President  Reagan:  \"if they go  for him\nagain, I hope  they get him.\"  483 U.S. at  381.  The Court found\nthat the statement, in  context, \"plainly dealt with a  matter of\n                               \npublic concern,\"  insofar  as it  \"came on  the heels  of a  news\nbulletin  regarding  what is  certainly  a  matter of  heightened\npublic attention:  an attempt on the life of the President.\"  Id.\n                                                                \nat 386 (emphasis  added).  The Court paid little attention to the\n\"form  and context\"  of McPherson's  statement, insofar  as those\nfactors  bore on her motives  for speaking; indeed,  if the Court\n                            \nhad  done so,  it probably  would have  found that  the statement\n(which apparently  occurred without  premeditation, in  a private\nconversation between  co-workers) was  motivated by little  or no\ncivic concern to inform the public on any relevant issue.  Rankin\n                                                                 \nsuggests  that the  courts  are to  proceed  to the  second-stage\nPickering  inquiry  whenever public-employee  speech, objectively\n         \nviewed in  the context of  a broader public  discourse, addresses\n(with  reasonable  specificity)  an  issue  or  topic implicating\n                                                     \n\"core\" First Amendment concerns.\n\n                                22\n\ndirectly implicated a topic of inherent concern to the  community\n\n   official misconduct  by an incumbent elected  official.  Given\n\ntheir direct bearing on Steeves' fitness for elective  office, we\n\nthink   O'Connor's  allegations  of  improper  purchases  clearly\n\nconstituted a matter of  legitimate public concern, obviating the\n\nneed for a threshold analysis of his dominant motive for speaking\n\nout  on these issues.6  Accordingly, we reject the Town's conten-\n\ntions, based on the \"form and context\" of O'Connor's speech, that\n\nO'Connor's personal motives should result  in the denial of First\n\nAmendment protection  at the threshold.  Cf.  Pickering, 391 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 572 (recognizing  that government employees \"are,  as a class,\n\nthe  members  of a  community most  likely  to have  informed and\n\n                    \n\n     6The district  court noted that the  summary judgment record\nincluded only  five Department invoices signed  by Steeves during\nthe  entire period in  question, representing cumulative personal\npurchases amounting to approximately $500, on which a total state\nsales tax approximating  $20-25 would  have been due.   Based  on\nthese small sums,  and the  fact that Steeves  repaid the  monies\nexpended by the Department,  the district court considered Steev-\nes'  alleged  misconduct de  minimis.    Given  their bearing  on\n                                    \nSteeves' fitness  for elective  office, these improper  purchases\nclearly pertained  to a matter  of legitimate public  interest to\nthe community.  If their  infrequency, modest amount, and  repay-\nment  tempered their  seriousness as  a reflection  upon Steeves'\nsuitability for elective office, that was a matter for the Nahant\nelectorate.

As the  district\n\ncourt  properly noted,  O'Connor failed  on several  occasions to\n\npublicize his allegations of  Steeves' misconduct directly to the\n                                                          \n\ncommunity;  instead, he  chose to  direct his disclosures  to the\n\nBoard of Selectmen.9  Nevertheless, the  decision to disclose his\n\nallegations to the Board, rather than the community at large, did\n\nnot  eliminate O'Connor's  First Amendment  interest in  speaking\n\nout.

Moreover, in addition\n                               \n\nto controlling  O'Connor's employment, the Board  of Selectmen is\n\nthe Town's highest  elective body, with  representative responsi-\n\nbility for  acting in  the best  interests of  the  Town and  its\n\ncitizenry.   Hence,  O'Connor's  decision to  address the  Board,\n\n                    \n\n     9Although  O'Connor raised  allegations against  Steeves' at\nseveral \"public meetings\" prior to  July 1990, the district court\nnoted  that few,  if any,  members of  the public  attended these\nmeetings.  O'Connor also published several internal memoranda, on\nDepartment stationery, discussing misuse of  Department accounts,\nbut the memoranda did not mention Steeves.  \n\n                                27\n\nrather  than the community at large, was no mere private communi-\n\ncation,  nor did it in  any sense extinguish  the inherent public\n\ninterest  in  his disclosures  of Steeves'  alleged misconduct.10\n\nEverything  considered, and viewing the  record in the light most\n\nfavorable  to O'Connor, we are unable to conclude that the Town's\n\ninterest in suppressing  O'Connor's speech outweighed  the impor-\n\ntance  of the  legitimate public  interest in  O'Connor's disclo-\n\nsures.11\n\n                    \n\n     10Indeed,  a  public employee,  whose  disclosures have  the\npotential to disrupt the employing agency or department, may  act\nresponsibly by  taking steps  to minimize disruption  by limiting\ndissemination to the public authorities most  directly concerned.\nSee Rankin, 483 U.S. at 389 (noting that employee \"had [not] dis-\n          \ncredited the  office by making  her statement  in public,\"  where\noffensive remark  \"was evidently  made in a  private conversation\nwith another  employee\"); Hubbard  v.

Healthy,  429 U.S.  at 27412.    O'Connor's alleged  lack of\n            \n\nqualifications for  the Superintendent's position,  combined with\n\nthe  public concern  over the  Town water  crisis, may  well have\n\nprovided neutral,  non-speech related  reasons  for Edwards'  and\n\nSteeves' votes against O'Connor's retention.
