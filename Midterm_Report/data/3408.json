Each of the four co-defendants was\n\n30   convicted of charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess\n\n31   with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana\n\n32   (Count One), see 21 U.S.C. § 846, of using a firearm to\n\n33   commit murder in relation to Count One’s marijuana\n\n\n                                   2\n\f1    conspiracy (Count Two), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(j)(1) & 2, and\n\n2    of using and carrying firearms during and in relation to\n\n3    Count One’s marijuana conspiracy (Count Three), see 18\n\n4    U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) & 2; each was additionally\n\n5    convicted individually of being either a felon (Peterkin) or\n\n6    an alien (Brown, Golding, Palmer) in possession of a firearm\n\n7    (Counts Four through Seven), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1),\n\n8    922(g)(5)(A), & 2.    The appellants raise a number of\n\n9    challenges to their convictions and sentences.\n\n10       Appellants argue that there was insufficient evidence\n\n11   to establish that the murder charged in Count Two was\n\n12   committed in relation to the marijuana conspiracy charged in\n\n13   Count One.    “A court may overturn a conviction on this basis\n\n14   only if, after viewing the evidence in the light most\n\n15   favorable to the Government and drawing all reasonable\n\n16   inferences in its favor, it finds that no rational trier of\n\n17   fact could have concluded that the Government met its burden\n\n18   of proof.”    United States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc.,\n\n19   544 F.3d 149, 158 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\n20   omitted).    There was clearly sufficient evidence for the\n\n21   jury to have inferred that Peterkin was robbed of 25 pounds\n\n22   of marijuana and $47,000 in cash by the victim.    The jury\n\n23   could have inferred that the purpose of the murder was to\n\n24   settle the dispute caused by the theft of drugs and drug\n\n                                    3\n\f1    proceeds.     “Because narcotics conspiracies are illicit\n\n2    ventures, disputes are frequently settled by force or the\n\n3    threat of force.     Consequently, advancing the aim of a\n\n4    narcotics conspiracy can involve performing ancillary\n\n5    functions such as enforcing discipline and chastising\n\n6    rivals.”     United States v. Santos, 541 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir.\n\n7    2008) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and internal\n\n8    citations omitted).     Ample evidence supported the jury’s\n\n9    verdict.\n\n10       Brown argues that the district court erred by admitting\n\n11   evidence of what he characterizes as unrelated drug\n\n12   ownership.     “We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of the\n\n13   district court’s broad discretion, reversing only when the\n\n14   court has acted arbitrarily or irrationally.”     United States\n\n15   v. Nektalov, 461 F.3d 309, 318 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal\n\n16   quotation marks omitted).     Evidence that Brown owned\n\n17   marijuana and scales used for weighing marijuana during the\n\n18   period he was alleged to have participated in a marijuana\n\n19   distribution conspiracy rendered more probable the fact of\n\n20   his membership in that conspiracy.     See Fed R. Evid. 401.\n\n21   Brown was permitted to argue that the drugs were for his\n\n22   personal use or were to be sold in an unrelated scheme; such\n\n23   arguments go to weight, not admissibility.     The district\n\n24   court did not err by admitting this evidence.\n\n                                     4\n\f1          Peterkin challenges the admission of a gun found in the\n\n2    bathroom of his motel room during a post-arrest protective\n\n3    sweep.    See generally Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 334\n\n4    (1990).     The officers had sufficient reasonable suspicion to\n\n5    perform a protective sweep of the bathroom: several\n\n6    suspected killers were staying in the motel and not all had\n\n7    been accounted for; Peterkin was arrested immediately\n\n8    outside his motel room; and the light in the bathroom was\n\n9    on.   Cf. United States v. Mickens, 926 F.2d 1323, 1328 (2d\n\n10   Cir. 1991).     Since the police were permitted to enter the\n\n11   bathroom and since the gun was found to have been in plain\n\n12   sight upon entry, it was properly seized and admitted.     See\n\n13   Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993).\n\n14         Palmer challenges the admission into evidence of his\n\n15   co-defendants’ statements on the theory that they implicitly\n\n16   referenced him.     “The crux of [the Confrontation Clause] is\n\n17   that the government cannot introduce at trial statements\n\n18   containing accusations against the defendant unless the\n\n19   accuser takes the stand against the defendant and is\n\n20   available for cross examination.”     United States v. Jass,\n\n21   569 F.3d 47, 55 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\n22   omitted).     “[T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by\n\n23   the admission of a nontestifying codefendant’s confession\n\n24   with a proper limiting instruction when . . . the confession\n\n                                     5\n\f1    is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant’s name, but\n\n2    any reference to his or her existence.”       Richardson v.\n\n3    Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987).       “[W]hat Bruton[ v. United\n\n4    States, 391 U.S. 123, 135-37 (1968),] and its progeny demand\n\n5    is a redaction and substitution adequate to remove the\n\n6    ‘overwhelming probability’ that a jury will not follow a\n\n7    limiting instruction that precludes its consideration of a\n\n8    redacted confession against a defendant other than the\n\n9    declarant.”   Jass, 569 F.3d at 60.\n\n10       To determine if a redacted confession may be admitted,\n\n11   “we examine first whether [the] redacted confession\n\n12   indicated to the jury that the original statement contained\n\n13   actual names and, second, whether the redacted confession,\n\n14   even if the very first item introduced at trial[,] would\n\n15   immediately inculpate [the non-declarant defendant] in the\n\n16   charged crime.”   Jass, 569 F.3d at 61 (internal citations\n\n17   and quotation marks omitted).       “[T]he appropriate analysis\n\n18   to be used when applying the Bruton rule requires that we\n\n19   view the redacted confession in isolation from the other\n\n20   evidence introduced at trial.”       United States v. Williams,\n\n21   936 F.2d 698, 700 (2d Cir. 1991).       As Palmer argues, the\n\n22   revised statements of Brown, Golding, and Peterkin are\n\n23   stilted by removal of so many appellations and the\n\n24   substitution of generic references (“the guy,” the “other\n\n                                     6\n\f1    person,” etc.).   But the revisions did not indicate names\n\n2    were omitted; moreover, the redacted statements--considering\n\n3    each statement alone, apart from all other trial evidence\n\n4    including the other statements, as we must--did not\n\n5    immediately inculpate Palmer.       Therefore, the statements\n\n6    were not admitted in error with these redactions.\n\n7        Finding no merit in any of the appellants’ remaining\n\n8    arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgments of the district\n\n9    court.\n\n10\n11\n12                               FOR THE COURT:\n13                               CATHERINE O’HAGAN WOLFE, CLERK\n14\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f",

Each of the four co-defendants was\n\n30   convicted of charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess\n\n31   with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana\n\n32   (Count One), see 21 U.S.C. § 846, of using a firearm to\n\n33   commit murder in relation to Count One’s marijuana\n\n\n                                   2\n\f1    conspiracy (Count Two), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(j)(1) & 2, and\n\n2    of using and carrying firearms during and in relation to\n\n3    Count One’s marijuana conspiracy (Count Three), see 18\n\n4    U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) & 2; each was additionally\n\n5    convicted individually of being either a felon (Peterkin) or\n\n6    an alien (Brown, Golding, Palmer) in possession of a firearm\n\n7    (Counts Four through Seven), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1),\n\n8    922(g)(5)(A), & 2.    The appellants raise a number of\n\n9    challenges to their convictions and sentences.\n\n10       Appellants argue that there was insufficient evidence\n\n11   to establish that the murder charged in Count Two was\n\n12   committed in relation to the marijuana conspiracy charged in\n\n13   Count One.    “A court may overturn a conviction on this basis\n\n14   only if, after viewing the evidence in the light most\n\n15   favorable to the Government and drawing all reasonable\n\n16   inferences in its favor, it finds that no rational trier of\n\n17   fact could have concluded that the Government met its burden\n\n18   of proof.”    United States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc.,\n\n19   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1314537\"><a href=\"/opinion/1314537/united-states-v-triumph-capital-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\n\n20   omitted).    There was clearly sufficient evidence for the\n\n21   jury to have inferred that Peterkin was robbed of 25 pounds\n\n22   of marijuana and $47,000 in cash by the victim.    The jury\n\n23   could have inferred that the purpose of the murder was to\n\n24   settle the dispute caused by the theft of drugs and drug\n\n                                    3\n\f1    proceeds.     “Because narcotics conspiracies are illicit\n\n2    ventures, disputes are frequently settled by force or the\n\n3    threat of force.     Consequently, advancing the aim of a\n\n4    narcotics conspiracy can involve performing ancillary\n\n5    functions such as enforcing discipline and chastising\n\n6    rivals.”     United States v. Santos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (2d Cir.\n\n7    2008) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and internal\n\n8    citations omitted).     Ample evidence supported the jury’s\n\n9    verdict.\n\n10       Brown argues that the district court erred by admitting\n\n11   evidence of what he characterizes as unrelated drug\n\n12   ownership.     “We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of the\n\n13   district court’s broad discretion, reversing only when the\n\n14   court has acted arbitrarily or irrationally.”     United States\n\n15   v. Nektalov, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795516\"><a href=\"/opinion/795516/united-states-v-roman-nektalov-eduard-nektalov/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal\n\n16   quotation marks omitted).     Evidence that Brown owned\n\n17   marijuana and scales used for weighing marijuana during the\n\n18   period he was alleged to have participated in a marijuana\n\n19   distribution conspiracy rendered more probable the fact of\n\n20   his membership in that conspiracy.     See Fed R. Evid. 401.\n\n21   Brown was permitted to argue that the drugs were for his\n\n22   personal use or were to be sold in an unrelated scheme; such\n\n23   arguments go to weight, not admissibility.     The district\n\n24   court did not err by admitting this evidence.\n\n                                     4\n\f1          Peterkin challenges the admission of a gun found in the\n\n2    bathroom of his motel room during a post-arrest protective\n\n3    sweep.    See generally Maryland v. Buie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112384\"><a href=\"/opinion/112384/maryland-v-buie/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334\n\n4    (1990).     The officers had sufficient reasonable suspicion to\n\n5    perform a protective sweep of the bathroom: several\n\n6    suspected killers were staying in the motel and not all had\n\n7    been accounted for; Peterkin was arrested immediately\n\n8    outside his motel room; and the light in the bathroom was\n\n9    on.   Cf. United States v. Mickens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556611\"><a href=\"/opinion/556611/united-states-of-america-cross-appellant-v-thomas-mickens-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1328 (2d\n\n10   Cir. 1991).     Since the police were permitted to enter the\n\n11   bathroom and since the gun was found to have been in plain\n\n12   sight upon entry, it was properly seized and admitted.     See\n\n13   Minnesota v. Dickerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112873\"><a href=\"/opinion/112873/minnesota-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (1993).\n\n14         Palmer challenges the admission into evidence of his\n\n15   co-defendants’ statements on the theory that they implicitly\n\n16   referenced him.     “The crux of [the Confrontation Clause] is\n\n17   that the government cannot introduce at trial statements\n\n18   containing accusations against the defendant unless the\n\n19   accuser takes the stand against the defendant and is\n\n20   available for cross examination.”     United States v. Jass,\n\n21   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2507/united-states-v-jass/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\n22   omitted).     “[T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by\n\n23   the admission of a nontestifying codefendant’s confession\n\n24   with a proper limiting instruction when . . . the confession\n\n                                     5\n\f1    is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant’s name, but\n\n2    any reference to his or her existence.”       Richardson v.\n\n3    Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211 (1987).       “[W]hat Bruton[ v.

Williams,\n\n21   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563663\"><a href=\"/opinion/563663/united-states-v-conrad-williams-and-wilbert-mckenzie-conrad-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 700 (2d Cir. 1991).       As Palmer argues, the\n\n22   revised statements of Brown, Golding, and Peterkin are\n\n23   stilted by removal of so many appellations and the\n\n24   substitution of generic references (“the guy,” the “other\n\n                                     6\n\f1    person,” etc.).   But the revisions did not indicate names\n\n2    were omitted; moreover, the redacted statements--considering\n\n3    each statement alone, apart from all other trial evidence\n\n4    including the other statements, as we must--did not\n\n5    immediately inculpate Palmer.       Therefore, the statements\n\n6    were not admitted in error with these redactions.\n\n7        Finding no merit in any of the appellants’ remaining\n\n8    arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgments of the district\n\n9    court.\n\n10\n11\n12                               FOR THE COURT:\n13                               CATHERINE O’HAGAN WOLFE, CLERK\n14\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f</pre>",
