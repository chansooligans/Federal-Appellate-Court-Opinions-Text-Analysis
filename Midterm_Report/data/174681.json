F. Dennis Saylor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                  Boudin, Howard and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Victoria M. Bonilla and Bourbeau & Bonilla, LLP on brief for\nappellant.\n     Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Chief of Appeals, and Carmen\nM. Ortiz, U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 2, 2010\n\f            Per Curiam.            Defendant-appellant Jean Colon appeals from\n\nhis 120-month prison sentence, the statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentence imposed on the basis of the district court's determination\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that he was accountable for five\n\nkilograms of cocaine in connection with the conspiracy charge to\n\nwhich he pled guilty.                The government has filed a motion for\n\nsummary disposition.              We affirm.\n\n            I. Apprendi Challenge\n\n            Colon asks this court to overrule its precedents holding\n\nthat judicially-found facts may be used to increase a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence without running afoul of the Sixth Amendment. See\n\nUnited   States        v.    Malouf,     466    F.3d    21,   27   (1st   Cir.   2006).\n\nAppellant    relies         upon    recent     concurring     opinions    by   Justices\n\nStevens and Thomas in United States v. O'Brien, 130 S.Ct. 2169\n\n(2010), urging that \"McMillan and Harris should be overruled, at\n\nleast to the extent that they authorize judicial factfinding on a\n\npreponderance of the evidence standard of facts that 'expos[e] a\n\ndefendant to [a] greater punishment than what is otherwise legally\n\nprescribed    .    .    .    '\"    Id.   at    2183    (Stevens,   J.,    concurring).\n\nHowever, \"[t]he Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed lower\n\ncourts that only it has the prerogative to overrule its own\n\ndecisions.\" United States v. Siciliano, 578 F.3d 61, 69 n. 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).       Until the Supreme Court overrules them, McMillan v.\n\nPennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79 (1986) and Harris v. United States, 536\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fU.S. 545 (2002) remain good law. See United States v. Vilches-\n\nNavarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 20 n. 14 (1st Cir. 2008).      The district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that it was required to abide by the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum sentence that corresponded to its drug\n\nquantity finding.\n\n          II. Individualized Drug Quantity Finding\n\n          \"When sentencing a participant in a drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy, the district court must make an individualized finding\n\nconcerning the quantity of drugs attributable to, or reasonably\n\nforeseeable by, the offender.\" United States v. Cintron-Echautegui,\n\n604 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010).   Similarly, \"to apply the mandatory\n\nminimum to a particular coconspirator, the sentencing court must\n\nmake a specific finding, supportable by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, ascribing the triggering amount to that coconspirator.\"\n\nUnited States v. Colon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nHere the triggering amount that established the 120-month mandatory\n\nminimum sentence was 5 kilograms of cocaine. Appellant argues that\n\nthe sentencing court failed to make such an individualized drug\n\nquantity determination.    \"Because the question of whether the\n\ndistrict court's drug quantity determination was based on an\n\nindividualized determination or not presents a question of law, our\n\nreview is de novo.\" Cintron-Echautegui, 604 F.3d at 5.1\n\n\n     1\n       The government maintains that plain error review should\napply because appellant failed to raise this argument before the\ndistrict court.    It is unnecessary to decide that question,\n\n                                 -3-\n\f             The transcript of the sentencing disposition clearly\n\ndemonstrates      that    the       district      court       made       the        requisite\n\nindividualized finding with respect to the drug quantity for which\n\nColon was responsible.             It specifically found that there was an\n\nintention and an agreement between Colon and his co-defendant\n\nAlexander Sanchez to supply five kilograms of cocaine, that Colon\n\n\"was capable of acquiring additional kilograms of cocaine,\" beyond\n\nthe three kilograms that were recovered, and that both Colon and\n\nSanchez were members of the conspiracy.                           That constitutes an\n\nindividualized finding that five kilograms of cocaine was a drug\n\nquantity that was attributable to, or foreseeable by, Colon as a\n\nmember of the conspiracy.\n\n             III. Evidentiary Support for Drug Quantity Finding\n\n             \"The sentencing court must determine drug quantity only\n\nby    a   preponderance       of   the    evidence.           A    sentencing        court's\n\ndetermination of drug quantity is a finding of fact and, as such,\n\nwill be upheld on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.                                Clear\n\nerror     will   be   found    only      when,   upon    whole-record-review,              an\n\ninquiring court 'form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake\n\nhas   been   made.'\"     Cintron-Echautegui,            604       F.3d   at    6.      Having\n\ncarefully reviewed the entire record, we are not persuaded that\n\n\n\n\nhowever, because appellant's claim cannot survive even de novo\nreview.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fsuch a mistake was made with respect to the court's drug quantity\n\ndetermination.\n\n              Appellant relies upon note 12 of U.S.S.G. ยง2D1.1, which\n\nprovides that the \"agreed-upon quantity\" shall be reduced to\n\nexclude \"the amount of controlled substance that the defendant\n\nestablishes that the defendant . . . was not reasonably capable of\n\nproviding or purchasing.\" Id.            However, it is the defendant's\n\nburden   to    \"prove[]   that   the   transaction   could   not   have   been\n\naccomplished.\" United States v. Campusano, 556 F.3d 36, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).       Appellant relies largely upon the fact that co-\n\ndefendant Matthew Leonard was sentenced for his participation in\n\nthe same conspiracy on the basis of a drug quantity of only four\n\nkilograms.\n\n              The discrepancy between the drug quantities for which\n\nColon and Leonard were held responsible does not establish that the\n\ncourt's drug quantity finding with respect to Colon was clearly\n\nerroneous.     The record does not indicate that Leonard participated\n\nin the recorded negotiations between Sanchez and Colon and the\n\ncooperating witness and undercover officer for the delivery of five\n\nkilograms. Therefore, the Probation Office may have concluded that\n\nthere was not sufficient evidence to find that Leonard could have\n\nforeseen that five kilograms would be distributed as part of the\n\nconspiracy. Although the record indicates that the three kilograms\n\nthat were delivered were supplied by Leonard, the record does not\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\festablish who would supply the additional two kilograms that were\n\npromised by Colon and Sanchez.        The sentencing court referenced\n\nLeonard as one potential source of supply, but the government's\n\nevidence     that   co-conspirators    Sanchez   and   Eric   Gonzalez\n\nparticipated in other multi-kilogram cocaine transactions in the\n\nfall of 2007 did not specify who the supplier was.     On this record,\n\nthe court was not required to find that Leonard was the only\n\npossible supplier of the additional two kilograms.     Therefore, the\n\nfact that Leonard was held responsible for only four kilograms of\n\ncocaine as a participant in the conspiracy does not amount to proof\n\nthat Colon and Sanchez did not have the capacity to obtain the\n\nadditional two kilograms that they had negotiated to supply to the\n\nundercover    officer.     The   district    court's   drug   quantity\n\ndetermination was not clearly erroneous.\n\n           Affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
