Richardson, 894 F.2d at 496.\n                       \n\n          In  evaluating  a  district  court's  denial of  a\n\nrequest  for  substitution  of  counsel,  we  consider   the\n\ntimeliness  of  the  request,  whether  the  district  court\n\nadequately  inquired  into  the complaint,  and  whether the\n\nattorney-client  conflict was  great  enough  to prevent  an\n\nadequate  defense.   Allen,  789  F.2d at  92.   The  record\n                          \n\nreflects  Person's request  occurred the  day  trial was  to\n\nbegin  (in  other  words,  in  an  untimely  fashion at  the\n\neleventh hour); Person had adequate opportunity to  persuade\n\nthe  district  court  that  Person's  complaints  about  his\n\nattorney  constituted   good  cause   for  substitution   of\n\ncounsel;5 and  the district  court appropriately  determined\n\nthe conflict between  Person and his attorney was  not great\n\nenough  to prevent an  adequate defense.   After considering\n\n                    \n\n5We note Person did not complain that Grasso was unprepared\nfor trial and that Grasso presented the court with\nadditional voir dire questions, indicating some degree of\npreparation.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\neach of  these factors, we  find the district court  did not\n\nabuse  its discretion  when it  denied  Person's request  to\n\nchange court-appointed counsel.\n\n          Downward departure from  career offender guideline\n                                                            \n\nrange.\n     \n\n          Before sentencing, the  court directed counsel  to\n\nbrief the  issue of whether  the court had the  authority to\n\ndepart  downward  from  the  sentencing  guideline  range if\n\ndefendant were a career offender.  Person contends the court\n\nincorrectly  concluded  it  did not  have  the  authority to\n\ndepart  downward and, as  a result, sentenced  Person within\n\nthe career offender  guideline range.  We do  not agree with\n\nPerson's contention.\n\n          A  sentencing  court's  decision  not  to   depart\n\ndownward  is  ordinarily  unappealable,   United  States  v.\n                                                            \n\nTardiff,  969 F.2d 1283,  1290 (1st  Cir. 1992),  unless the\n       \n\ndecision  is based  on a  \"mistaken view  that it  lacks the\n\nlegal authority to consider a departure.\"   United States v.\n                                                            \n\nRomolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).\n      \n\n          At sentencing, the district court  found Person to\n\nbe a  career offender.   Although the First Circuit  has not\n\ndirectly  addressed whether a court may depart downward when\n\nsentencing a career offender, the district court noted those\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ncourts  that have departed downward from the career offender\n\nguideline range  primarily \"did so  when they found  ... the\n\ncareer  offender  status  over-represented  the  defendant's\n\ncriminal history.\"  See, e.g., United States v. Beckham, 968\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 47,  54 (D.C.Cir. 1992);  United States v.  Bowser, 941\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  1019, 1023-24  (10th  Cir.  1991);  United  States  v.\n                                                            \n\nPinckney, 938 F.2d 519, 521  (4th Cir. 1991); United  States\n                                                            \n\nv.  Lawrence, 916  F.2d 553,  554-55 (9th  Cir. 1990).   See\n                                                            \n\ngenerally  United  States  Sentencing   Guidelines     4A1.3\n         \n\n(Policy Statement).  After careful consideration of Person's\n\ncriminal  history  and  the circumstances  of  his  criminal\n\nconduct,  the district court  concluded it would  not depart\n\ndownward in this instance.\n\n               We  find the district  court did not sentence\n\nPerson within the  career offender guideline range  based on\n\nan erroneous  determination  that  it  lacked  authority  to\n\nconsider a downward departure.   The court did not hold that\n\nit  could not  (i.e.,  lacked  legal  authority)  to  depart\n\ndownward, but rather  found and held that it would not.  The\n\ndistrict court's decision not to depart downward \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nis,  therefore, unappealable.  See United States v.
