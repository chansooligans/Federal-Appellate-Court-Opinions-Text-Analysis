The United States Postal Service\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nprides itself on surmounting obstacles that nature  places in its\n\npath.1    In this  bitterly  contested  case, plaintiff-appellant\n\nMichael Pagano, a veteran postal worker, complains that, whatever\n\nsuccess the Service may have encountered in its struggle with the\n\nelements,  it has  been unable  to surmount a  man-made obstacle:\n\nprejudice in the workplace.  The district court ruled in favor of\n\nthe defendant.  Finding appellant's arguments to be unpersuasive,\n\nwe affirm.  \n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The Lynnfield  Post Office  hired appellant as  a part-\n\ntime mail carrier in  1973.  He  became a full-time employee  two\n\nyears later, working primarily as a clerk at a branch office.  In\n\n1983, \n\nappellant became a dispatcher  at the main post office  under the\n\ndirect  supervision of  James Walsh.   Walsh  and Pagano  did not\n\nenjoy a cordial  working relationship   a situation  that perhaps\n\nstemmed from the latter's propensity for unauthorized absences.\n\n          When Walsh was promoted to postmaster in mid-1984, Paul\n\nHentschel  became  Pagano's supervisor.    On  December 2,  1984,\n\nHentschel sent  appellant an admonitory letter regarding frequent\n\ntardiness  and excessive  use of  sick leave.   A  second warning\n\nletter, issued exactly one year later, cited continuing instances\n\n                    \n\n     1An  inscription on the exterior  of the main  New York City\npost  office,  often thought  to be  the Postal  Service's motto,\nreads:  \"Neither snow,  nor rain,  nor heat,  nor gloom  of night\nstays these couriers from  their appointed rounds.\" (adapted from\nVIII Herodotus, Histories 98).\n                         \n\n                                2\n\nof unpunctuality and sick leave abuses during a two-month  period\n\nending December 2, 1985.\n\n          Notwithstanding these  admonitions, appellant persisted\n\nin  his moratory ways.  Hentschel suspended him for seven days in\n\nJanuary (later reduced to five) and fourteen days in March (later\n\nreduced to seven).  Seeing no improvement, Hentschel issued a so-\n\ncalled \"notice of  removal\" on July  15, 1986 (later  withdrawn),\n\nand  reissued it  on  October  22,  1986.    During  the  ensuing\n\ngrievance  proceedings,  Walsh  overrode Hentschel's  action  and\n\nauthorized  a \"last  chance\" agreement.   Although  the agreement\n\ncontained  a  promise  that   appellant  would  report  for  work\n\nregularly and punctually, this covenant was honored mainly in the\n\nbreach:  appellant was  absent or late nineteen times  during the\n\nfour-month period  ending March  23, 1987.   Hentschel discharged\n\nappellant  in May of that year, citing his \"lack of dependability\n\nin reporting and not being available for duty.\"  \n\n          Three months after  his termination, appellant filed  a\n\nformal  administrative complaint with  the Postal Service's equal\n\nemployment  opportunity office,  alleging  that he  was dismissed\n\nbecause  of  his employer's  animus  against  persons of  Italian\n\norigin.2  For the next three years, appellant  vigorously pursued\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellant  originally claimed that  a second discriminatory\nanimus, arising  out of his role in the investigation of a sexual\nharassment complaint,  contributed to his difficulties.   He has,\nhowever, abandoned this  theory on appeal.   Accordingly, we pass\nover it.  See United States v. Slade,     F.2d     ,     n.3 (1st\n                                    \nCir.  1992) [No.  92-1176, slip  op. at  6 n.3]  (reiterating the\ngeneral  rule that \"theories neither briefed nor argued on appeal\nare deemed to have been waived\").\n\n                                3\n\nhis case on the administrative level.  Receiving no satisfaction,\n\nhe  brought suit  against the  Postmaster General  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  \n\n          Appellant docketed his complaint in the  district court\n\non August  7, 1990.   On  February 19,  1992, a  magistrate judge\n\ndenied  his motion  for  leave  to  file  an  amended  complaint.\n\nSeveral  months   thereafter,  the  district  court  granted  the\n\ndefendant's motion for summary judgment.  This appeal ensued.\n\nII.  THE NEED TO OBJECT TO A MAGISTRATE'S ORDER\n\n          As a preliminary  matter, appellant  contends that  the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying his motion to add counts alleging\n\nwrongful  discharge and  breach of  contract.   The facts  are as\n\nfollows.   Appellant's motion to amend his complaint was filed on\n\nJanuary  10, 1992.   The district judge referred  the motion to a\n\nmagistrate  judge who  denied it  on grounds of  futility, ruling\n\nthat the additional claims  were both preempted by Title  VII and\n\nthat, moreover,  the wrongful  discharge claim failed  to comport\n\nwith  the Federal  Tort Claims  Act.   Appellant took  no further\n\naction.   Because appellant failed to object  to the magistrate's\n\norder within the prescribed  ten-day period, see Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n                                                \n\n72(a), we cannot consider this assignment of error.3\n\n                    \n\n     3We analyze this point under Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) partially\nbecause  appellant,   in   post-argument  briefing   before   us,\nexplicitly invited  that characterization.   However, even  if we\nviewed  the  magistrate's  denial  of  the  motion  to  amend  as\nimplicating  28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(B)  and Fed. R.  Civ. P. 72(b)\nrather than 28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A) and Rule 72(a),  the result\nthat we reach  would not be affected.  See  Park Motor Mart, Inc.\n                                                                 \nv. Ford  Motor Co., 616  F.2d 603, 605  (1st Cir. 1980)  (holding\n                  \nthat, in respect to  a magistrate's recommended disposition under\n\n                                4\n\n          Under  ordinary  circumstances  a  motion  to  amend  a\n\ncomplaint is \"a  pretrial matter  not dispositive of  a claim  or\n\ndefense of a party\" within the  purview of Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).\n\nSee Walker v. Union Carbide Corp., 630 F. Supp. 275,  277 (D. Me.\n                                 \n\n1986);  see  also  28  U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A)  (providing  that a\n                 \n\ndistrict judge  \"may designate a magistrate to hear and determine\n\nany  pretrial  matter,\"  with certain  enumerated  exceptions not\n\nrelevant here).  A party displeased  by a magistrate's order on a\n\nnondispositive motion must serve and file objections to the order\n\nwithin ten days.   See Fed.  R. Civ. P.  72(a); see generally  28\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.    636(d) (congressional grant  of rulemaking power).   If\n\nthe aggrieved  party preserves his  rights in  this fashion,  the\n\ndistrict  judge can set aside the magistrate's ruling if he finds\n\nit  to be \"clearly  erroneous or contrary  to law.\"   28 U.S.C.  \n\n636(b)(1)(A);  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).  If, however, the aggrieved\n\nparty  sits idly  by and  fails to  object within  the prescribed\n\nperiod, he  \"may not thereafter  assign as error a  defect in the\n\nmagistrate's order  . . . .\"  Id.;  see also Rule 2(b), Rules for\n                                            \n\nU.S. Magistrates  in the  United  States District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict   of   Massachusetts   (implementing   28    U.S.C.     \n\n636(b)(1)(A), (d) and Civil Rule 72 (a)).\n\n          In  this  instance,  Pagano   did  not  object  to  the\n\n                    \n\nsection 636(b)(1)(B),  \"a party 'may' file  objections within ten\ndays or he may  not, as he  chooses, but he 'shall'  do so if  he\nwishes  further consideration\"); accord  Davet v.  Maccarone, 973\n                                                            \nF.2d 22, 30-31 (1st  Cir. 1992); Templeman v. Chris  Craft Corp.,\n                                                                \n770 F.2d 245, 247 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1021 (1985);\n                                          \nScott v. Schweiker, 702 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir. 1983).\n                  \n\n                                5\n\nmagistrate's  denial of  the  motion to  amend.   That  ends  the\n\nmatter.  Congress  granted the courts of  appeals jurisdiction to\n\nhear  appeals \"from all final decisions of the district courts of\n\nthe United States.\"  28 U.S.C.    1291.  We have held that  for a\n\nmagistrate's  decision to be  \"final\" within  the meaning  of the\n\nstatute  it \"must have been reviewed by the district court, which\n\nretains ultimate decision-making power.\"  United States v. Ecker,\n                                                                \n\n923 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Siers v.

THE PROPRIETY OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n          We  divide  our  examination  of the  summary  judgment\n\nentered below into two segments.  We  begin by outlining the Rule\n\n56 standard and then proceed to the underlying Title VII claim.\n\n                A.  The Summary Judgment Standard.\n                                                 \n\n          Summary  judgment is  appropriate when  \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories,  and admissions on file,\n\ntogether  with  the affidavits,  if any,  show  that there  is no\n\ngenuine  issue as to any material  fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as  a matter of law.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n56(c).  Where, as in this case, the defendant has invoked Rule 56\n\nand asserted  a lack of  supporting evidence, the  plaintiff must\n\nestablish  the existence of a triable issue which is both genuine\n\nand material to his claim.  See  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n477 U.S. 242, 247-48  (1986).  \"In this context,  'genuine' means\n\nthat  the evidence about the fact is  such that a reasonable jury\n\ncould resolve the  point in  favor of the  nonmoving party  [and]\n\n'material'  means  that the  fact is  one  that might  affect the\n\n                                7\n\noutcome of the  suit under the governing law.\"   United States v.\n                                                              \n\nOne  Parcel  of  Real  Property, Etc.

To\n                                        \n\nthe  contrary, the  nonmovant must  \"present definite,  competent\n\nevidence to rebut the motion.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 816, 822  (1st Cir.  1991), cert.  denied, 112  S. Ct.  2965\n                                              \n\n(1992).  Even when elusive concepts like motive or intent are  in\n\nplay,  \"summary judgment  may  be appropriate  if the  non-moving\n\nparty  rests  merely  upon  conclusory   allegations,  improbable\n\ninferences, and  unsupported speculation.\"  Medina-Munoz  v. R.J.\n                                                                 \n\nReynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                    \n\n          We afford plenary review to a district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment.  In the course thereof, we must read the record\n\nin  the light  most  amicable  to  the party  contesting  summary\n\njudgment, indulging  all reasonable  inferences  in that  party's\n\nfavor.  See, e.g., Griggs-Ryan v.  Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1990).\n\n                     B.  The Title VII Claim.\n                                            \n\n          Title  VII  renders  it  unlawful for  an  employer  to\n\n\"discharge  any  individual .  . .  because of  such individual's\n\nrace,  color, religion,  sex, or  national origin  . .  . .\"   42\n\n                                8\n\nU.S.C.    2000e-2(a)(1).   To  prevail  on a  Title VII  claim, a\n\nplaintiff must prove that the defendant discriminated against him\n\nfor  a proscribed reason.  See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto\n                                                                 \n\nRico,  902  F.2d 148,  153 (1st  Cir.  1990).   Because appellant\n    \n\nproduced  no direct  evidence of  discriminatory intent,  we must\n\ninitially analyze his  claim under the  burden-shifting framework\n\nof  McDonnell  Douglas  Corp.  v.  Green, 411  U.S.  792,  802-05\n                                        \n\n(1973).5  \n\n          McDonnell  Douglas requires,  first, that  the claimant\n                            \n\nstate a prima facie case.   This showing transfers the burden  of\n\nproduction,  requiring  the  employer  to  articulate   (but  not\n\nnecessarily  prove)  some  legitimate,  nondiscriminatory  reason\n\njustifying the adverse  employment action.  Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n153.  Satisfying this  burden of production effectively dissolves\n\nthe  inference of  discrimination  arising  from the  plaintiff's\n\nprima facie  case.6  See White  v. Vathally, 732 F.2d  1037, 1040\n                                           \n\n(1st \n\n                    \n\n     5In  general, the  McDonnell Douglas  model operates  in the\n                                         \nsame way  for  Title VII  cases as  for cases  brought under  the\nfederal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.   \n621-634 (1988).   See Villanueva v.  Wellesley College, 930  F.2d\n                                                      \n124, 127 n.2 (1st Cir.) cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 181 (1991); Loeb\n                                                                 \nv. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1015 (1st Cir. 1979).  Hence, we\n                \ncite  interchangeably  to Title  VII  and ADEA  decisions  in the\nsuccedent analysis.\n\n     6Even though the  McDonnell Douglas inference  vanishes, the\n                                        \nevidence  submitted in  support of  the prima facie  case remains\nunder  consideration.     See  Mesnick,  950  F.2d   at  825  n.6\n                                      \n(explaining  that, although the burden-shifting framework becomes\ninconsequential  at this point, the district  court, faced with a\nRule 56 motion, \"must still examine the evidence that the parties\nadduced in proceeding under the framework\").\n\n                                9\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 933 (1984).  Once the parties reach\n                   \n\nthis  stage, therefore,  the  plaintiff, if  he  is to  defeat  a\n\nproperly documented motion for summary judgment, \"must offer some\n\nminimally  sufficient  evidence,  direct  or  indirect,  both  of\n\npretext and  of the employer's discriminatory  animus.\"  Mesnick,\n                                                                \n\n950 F.2d at 825; accord Villanueva v. Wellesley College, 930 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n124,  127-28 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 112  S.

University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988).   \n\n          In  this  case, the  district court  apparently assumed\n\nthat appellant stated a  prima facie case7 and that  the employer\n\narticulated a  facially valid, nondiscriminatory  reason (chronic\n\nabsenteeism and tardiness) for the dismissal.  From that starting\n\npoint,  the court ruled against  appellant on two  bases.  First,\n\nthe court  determined that appellant failed to submit evidence of\n\npretext.  Second,  the court found that \"there is  no evidence in\n\nthe  record  .  . .  that  would  justify  even a  circumstantial\n\ninference  that plaintiff  was dismissed  because of  his Italian\n\nheritage.\"    Either  conclusion  would  have  warranted   brevis\n\ndisposition.   Having  scrutinized the  record, we  are persuaded\n\nthat both are supportable.\n\n                    \n\n     7In employment termination cases, a  prima facie case may be\nestablished by demonstrating that \"(1) the plaintiff was within a\nprotected  class;  (2)  she  was qualified  for,  and  adequately\nperformed, her job; (3)  she was nevertheless dismissed; and  (4)\nafter  her  departure, the  employer  sought  someone of  roughly\nequivalent  qualifications  to  perform  substantially  the  same\nwork.\"   Cumpiano,  902  F.2d at  153.   Following  the  district\n                 \ncourt's lead,  we also  assume arguendo that  appellant stated  a\n                                       \nprima facie case.   \n\n                                10\n\n          1.   Pretext.  Appellant's effort  to establish pretext\n          1.   Pretext.\n                      \n\ntakes an  unexpected twist.   The Postal Service's  stated reason\n\nfor cashiering Pagano focused on his rotten attendance record and\n\nunremitting lack of  punctuality.  Usually, a Title VII plaintiff\n\nseeks to show pretext  by attacking the factual premise  on which\n\nthe employer's professed reason  rests.  Here, however, appellant\n\nconcedes the truth of  the Service's factual predicate    he was,\n\nby his own admission, often absent and frequently late   but says\n\nthat the proffered reason  was nonetheless pretextual because the\n\nemployer's  attendance policy was not applied to other, similarly\n\nsituated, non-Italian employees in the same way.  \n\n          This uncommon  claim hinges on  appellant's attempt  to\n\ncompare  his work record and  treatment with the  work record and\n\ntreatment  of  one  Patrick  Rafferty,  a  co-employee  of  Irish\n\ndescent.  In appellant's view, Rafferty committed equivalent sins\n\nbut received much milder punishment.   The court below jettisoned\n\nthis claim, finding that Rafferty's case was not a fair congener.\n\nWe agree.  \n\n          In  contending that  he  and Rafferty  were  \"similarly\n\nsituated,\" appellant limits  his analysis to the  number of times\n\nthe two men were late during a finite period.  Yet, appellant had\n\na  substantially longer  and  more varied  history of  attendance\n\nproblems than did Rafferty and appellant, unlike Rafferty, failed\n\nto mend his ways following receipt of formal warnings.  Appellant\n\nalso  racked  up many  more  violations of  the  Postal Service's\n\nattendance policy than did Rafferty when items such as sick time,\n\n                                11\n\nabsences without leave, and the like are taken into account.8 \n\n          In short, the record shows beyond hope of contradiction\n\nthat the  two men were  not similarly situated  vis-a-vis overall\n\nattendance and  that Rafferty,  like Pagano, was  disciplined for\n\nprovable infractions at a level corresponding to the infractions'\n\nseverity.   In the absence of  any other evidence that the Postal\n\nService applied the attendance rules unevenly, the district court\n\ndid  not err  in  holding  that there  was  no  genuine issue  of\n\nmaterial  fact  on  the question  of  pretext.9    See Oliver  v.\n                                                             \n\nDigital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 109 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                    \n\n          2.   Discriminatory Animus.   Appellant likewise failed\n          2.   Discriminatory Animus.\n                                    \n\nto  adduce any  evidence  tending to  prove defendant's  supposed\n\ndiscriminatory intent.    Appellant  produced  no  evidence  that\n\nHentschel, the official responsible for monitoring the attendance\n\npolicy  and initiating  disciplinary  proceedings,   harbored  an\n\nanti-Italian animus.  Rather, he attempted to establish animus by\n\nshowing  that Walsh,  the Lynnfield  postmaster, nursed  a grudge\n\n                    \n\n     8For example,  in the seventeen months  prior to appellant's\ndismissal, he  was involved  in fifty-three  separate occurrences\nthat called  the attendance  rules into  question.   Rafferty was\ninvolved in only fourteen such instances during the same period.\n\n     9Relatedly, appellant  asserts that there is  a fact dispute\nabout  whether the  Postal  Service  consistently recorded  every\ninstance  of  employee  lateness or  absence.    Even  if such  a\nquestion  exists,  however,  it  is not  material  to  this case.\nAppellant adduced  no proof  that  the Service  either failed  to\nrecord transgressions based  upon employees'  national origin  or\nplaced  ersatz  infractions on  his  work  record.   Indeed,  his\nevidence  suggests  that  the  Service  may  have  been  somewhat\ncharitable  in not  recording  all violations  of the  attendance\nrules.  If this is so, appellant, as a habitual latecomer, likely\nbenefitted from the employer's laxity.  \n\n                                12\n\nagainst persons of Italian descent.  The sum total of appellant's\n\nevidence consists of three statements  attributed to Walsh.  When\n\nreacting  to  news  that  he  had  become  appellant's  immediate\n\nsuperior, Walsh allegedly  remarked, \"Good, now we can fire you.\"\n\nOn  another occasion, Walsh  allegedly told  a co-worker  that he\n\nhoped appellant would quit.  Finally, upon hearing an employee of\n\nItalian lineagecough, Walsh reputedly said, \"I hope he chokes.\"  \n\n          This evidence  is manifestly  insufficient to  create a\n\ntrialworthy  issue  regarding  the  existence  of  a  statutorily\n\nproscribed  animus.   To  be  sure,  the attributed  remarks  are\n\nconcededly  coarse     but  there  is  nothing  about them  which\n\nsuggests  to  an   objectively  reasonable  observer   that  they\n\nconstituted  expressions  of  discrimination  based  on  national\n\norigin.   Sporadic instances of  rude behavior, without  more, do\n\nnot comprise competent proof of nationality-based discrimination.\n\nSee, e.g., Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 826; Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 9-\n                                                 \n\n10;  Robinson v.  Montgomery Ward &amp;  Co., 823 F.2d  793, 797 (4th\n                                        \n\nCir.  1987),  cert.  denied,  484  U.S.  1042  (1988);  Clark  v.\n                                                             \n\nAtchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

We  hold,  therefore, that  this  smattering of  offhand\n\ncomments,  spread over a fourteen-year  period, fails as a matter\n\nof law to show anti-Italian animus.10\n\n                    \n\n     10In view of this ruling, we need not reach, and, thus, take\nno  view anent,  the  district court's  alternative holding  that\nWalsh's  comments, even  if probative  of ethnic  hostility, were\ninconsequential absent evidence  that he had some input  into, or\nimpact upon, Hentschel's decision  to end appellant's employment.\n\n                                13\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go no further.  We are without jurisdiction to\n\nconsider appellant's belated challenge to the magistrate's denial\n\nof his motion to file an amended complaint.  And,  given the lack\n\nof a triable issue of fact regarding either pretext or animus, we\n\nconclude,  without  serious   question,  that  the   lower  court\n\nappropriately entered judgment in defendant's favor.  See Oliver,\n                                                                \n\n846 F.2d  at 109 (holding  that summary  judgment is proper  in a\n\nTitle  VII case  where plaintiff's  opposition, at  bottom, rests\n\nsolely upon \"unsupported allegations and speculation\").  \n\nAffirmed.\n         \n\n                    \n\nSee, e.g.,  Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 10  (\"The biases of one who\n                        \nneither makes  nor influences the  challenged personnel  decision\nare not probative in an employment discrimination case.\").\n\n                                14\n",

The United States Postal Service\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nprides itself on surmounting obstacles that nature  places in its\n\npath.1    In this  bitterly  contested  case, plaintiff-appellant\n\nMichael Pagano, a veteran postal worker, complains that, whatever\n\nsuccess the Service may have encountered in its struggle with the\n\nelements,  it has  been unable  to surmount a  man-made obstacle:\n\nprejudice in the workplace.  The district court ruled in favor of\n\nthe defendant.  Finding appellant's arguments to be unpersuasive,\n\nwe affirm.  \n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The Lynnfield  Post Office  hired appellant as  a part-\n\ntime mail carrier in  1973.  He  became a full-time employee  two\n\nyears later, working primarily as a clerk at a branch office.  In\n\n1983, \n\nappellant became a dispatcher  at the main post office  under the\n\ndirect  supervision of  James Walsh.   Walsh  and Pagano  did not\n\nenjoy a cordial  working relationship   a situation  that perhaps\n\nstemmed from the latter's propensity for unauthorized absences.\n\n          When Walsh was promoted to postmaster in mid-1984, Paul\n\nHentschel  became  Pagano's supervisor.    On  December 2,  1984,\n\nHentschel sent  appellant an admonitory letter regarding frequent\n\ntardiness  and excessive  use of  sick leave.   A  second warning\n\nletter, issued exactly one year later, cited continuing instances\n\n                    \n\n     1An  inscription on the exterior  of the main  New York City\npost  office,  often thought  to be  the Postal  Service's motto,\nreads:  \"Neither snow,  nor rain,  nor heat,  nor gloom  of night\nstays these couriers from  their appointed rounds.\" (adapted from\nVIII Herodotus, Histories 98).\n                         \n\n                                2\n\nof unpunctuality and sick leave abuses during a two-month  period\n\nending December 2, 1985.\n\n          Notwithstanding these  admonitions, appellant persisted\n\nin  his moratory ways.  Hentschel suspended him for seven days in\n\nJanuary (later reduced to five) and fourteen days in March (later\n\nreduced to seven).  Seeing no improvement, Hentschel issued a so-\n\ncalled \"notice of  removal\" on July  15, 1986 (later  withdrawn),\n\nand  reissued it  on  October  22,  1986.    During  the  ensuing\n\ngrievance  proceedings,  Walsh  overrode Hentschel's  action  and\n\nauthorized  a \"last  chance\" agreement.   Although  the agreement\n\ncontained  a  promise  that   appellant  would  report  for  work\n\nregularly and punctually, this covenant was honored mainly in the\n\nbreach:  appellant was  absent or late nineteen times  during the\n\nfour-month period  ending March  23, 1987.   Hentschel discharged\n\nappellant  in May of that year, citing his \"lack of dependability\n\nin reporting and not being available for duty.\"  \n\n          Three months after  his termination, appellant filed  a\n\nformal  administrative complaint with  the Postal Service's equal\n\nemployment  opportunity office,  alleging  that he  was dismissed\n\nbecause  of  his employer's  animus  against  persons of  Italian\n\norigin.2  For the next three years, appellant  vigorously pursued\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellant  originally claimed that  a second discriminatory\nanimus, arising  out of his role in the investigation of a sexual\nharassment complaint,  contributed to his difficulties.   He has,\nhowever, abandoned this  theory on appeal.   Accordingly, we pass\nover it.  See United States v. Slade,     F.2d     ,     n.3 (1st\n                                    \nCir.  1992) [No.  92-1176, slip  op. at  6 n.3]  (reiterating the\ngeneral  rule that \"theories neither briefed nor argued on appeal\nare deemed to have been waived\").\n\n                                3\n\nhis case on the administrative level.  Receiving no satisfaction,\n\nhe  brought suit  against the  Postmaster General  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  \n\n          Appellant docketed his complaint in the  district court\n\non August  7, 1990.   On  February 19,  1992, a  magistrate judge\n\ndenied  his motion  for  leave  to  file  an  amended  complaint.\n\nSeveral  months   thereafter,  the  district  court  granted  the\n\ndefendant's motion for summary judgment.  This appeal ensued.\n\nII.  THE NEED TO OBJECT TO A MAGISTRATE'S ORDER\n\n          As a preliminary  matter, appellant  contends that  the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying his motion to add counts alleging\n\nwrongful  discharge and  breach of  contract.   The facts  are as\n\nfollows.   Appellant's motion to amend his complaint was filed on\n\nJanuary  10, 1992.   The district judge referred  the motion to a\n\nmagistrate  judge who  denied it  on grounds of  futility, ruling\n\nthat the additional claims  were both preempted by Title  VII and\n\nthat, moreover,  the wrongful  discharge claim failed  to comport\n\nwith  the Federal  Tort Claims  Act.   Appellant took  no further\n\naction.   Because appellant failed to object  to the magistrate's\n\norder within the prescribed  ten-day period, see Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n                                                \n\n72(a), we cannot consider this assignment of error.3\n\n                    \n\n     3We analyze this point under Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) partially\nbecause  appellant,   in   post-argument  briefing   before   us,\nexplicitly invited  that characterization.   However, even  if we\nviewed  the  magistrate's  denial  of  the  motion  to  amend  as\nimplicating  28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(B)  and Fed. R.  Civ. P. 72(b)\nrather than 28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A) and Rule 72(a),  the result\nthat we reach  would not be affected.

University of Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 895 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988).   \n\n          In  this  case, the  district court  apparently assumed\n\nthat appellant stated a  prima facie case7 and that  the employer\n\narticulated a  facially valid, nondiscriminatory  reason (chronic\n\nabsenteeism and tardiness) for the dismissal.  From that starting\n\npoint,  the court ruled against  appellant on two  bases.  First,\n\nthe court  determined that appellant failed to submit evidence of\n\npretext.  Second,  the court found that \"there is  no evidence in\n\nthe  record  .  . .  that  would  justify  even a  circumstantial\n\ninference  that plaintiff  was dismissed  because of  his Italian\n\nheritage.\"    Either  conclusion  would  have  warranted   brevis\n\ndisposition.   Having  scrutinized the  record, we  are persuaded\n\nthat both are supportable.\n\n                    \n\n     7In employment termination cases, a  prima facie case may be\nestablished by demonstrating that \"(1) the plaintiff was within a\nprotected  class;  (2)  she  was qualified  for,  and  adequately\nperformed, her job; (3)  she was nevertheless dismissed; and  (4)\nafter  her  departure, the  employer  sought  someone of  roughly\nequivalent  qualifications  to  perform  substantially  the  same\nwork.\"   Cumpiano,  902  F.2d at  153.   Following  the  district\n                 \ncourt's lead,  we also  assume arguendo that  appellant stated  a\n                                       \nprima facie case.   \n\n                                10\n\n          1.   Pretext.  Appellant's effort  to establish pretext\n          1.   Pretext.\n                      \n\ntakes an  unexpected twist.   The Postal Service's  stated reason\n\nfor cashiering Pagano focused on his rotten attendance record and\n\nunremitting lack of  punctuality.  Usually, a Title VII plaintiff\n\nseeks to show pretext  by attacking the factual premise  on which\n\nthe employer's professed reason  rests.  Here, however, appellant\n\nconcedes the truth of  the Service's factual predicate    he was,\n\nby his own admission, often absent and frequently late   but says\n\nthat the proffered reason  was nonetheless pretextual because the\n\nemployer's  attendance policy was not applied to other, similarly\n\nsituated, non-Italian employees in the same way.  \n\n          This uncommon  claim hinges on  appellant's attempt  to\n\ncompare  his work record and  treatment with the  work record and\n\ntreatment  of  one  Patrick  Rafferty,  a  co-employee  of  Irish\n\ndescent.  In appellant's view, Rafferty committed equivalent sins\n\nbut received much milder punishment.   The court below jettisoned\n\nthis claim, finding that Rafferty's case was not a fair congener.\n\nWe agree.  \n\n          In  contending that  he  and Rafferty  were  \"similarly\n\nsituated,\" appellant limits  his analysis to the  number of times\n\nthe two men were late during a finite period.  Yet, appellant had\n\na  substantially longer  and  more varied  history of  attendance\n\nproblems than did Rafferty and appellant, unlike Rafferty, failed\n\nto mend his ways following receipt of formal warnings.  Appellant\n\nalso  racked  up many  more  violations of  the  Postal Service's\n\nattendance policy than did Rafferty when items such as sick time,\n\n                                11\n\nabsences without leave, and the like are taken into account.8 \n\n          In short, the record shows beyond hope of contradiction\n\nthat the  two men were  not similarly situated  vis-a-vis overall\n\nattendance and  that Rafferty,  like Pagano, was  disciplined for\n\nprovable infractions at a level corresponding to the infractions'\n\nseverity.   In the absence of  any other evidence that the Postal\n\nService applied the attendance rules unevenly, the district court\n\ndid  not err  in  holding  that there  was  no  genuine issue  of\n\nmaterial  fact  on  the question  of  pretext.9    See Oliver  v.\n                                                             \n\nDigital Equip.

Discriminatory Animus.   Appellant likewise failed\n          2.   Discriminatory Animus.\n                                    \n\nto  adduce any  evidence  tending to  prove defendant's  supposed\n\ndiscriminatory intent.    Appellant  produced  no  evidence  that\n\nHentschel, the official responsible for monitoring the attendance\n\npolicy  and initiating  disciplinary  proceedings,   harbored  an\n\nanti-Italian animus.  Rather, he attempted to establish animus by\n\nshowing  that Walsh,  the Lynnfield  postmaster, nursed  a grudge\n\n                    \n\n     8For example,  in the seventeen months  prior to appellant's\ndismissal, he  was involved  in fifty-three  separate occurrences\nthat called  the attendance  rules into  question.   Rafferty was\ninvolved in only fourteen such instances during the same period.\n\n     9Relatedly, appellant  asserts that there is  a fact dispute\nabout  whether the  Postal  Service  consistently recorded  every\ninstance  of  employee  lateness or  absence.    Even  if such  a\nquestion  exists,  however,  it  is not  material  to  this case.\nAppellant adduced  no proof  that  the Service  either failed  to\nrecord transgressions based  upon employees'  national origin  or\nplaced  ersatz  infractions on  his  work  record.   Indeed,  his\nevidence  suggests  that  the  Service  may  have  been  somewhat\ncharitable  in not  recording  all violations  of the  attendance\nrules.  If this is so, appellant, as a habitual latecomer, likely\nbenefitted from the employer's laxity.  \n\n                                12\n\nagainst persons of Italian descent.  The sum total of appellant's\n\nevidence consists of three statements  attributed to Walsh.  When\n\nreacting  to  news  that  he  had  become  appellant's  immediate\n\nsuperior, Walsh allegedly  remarked, \"Good, now we can fire you.\"\n\nOn  another occasion, Walsh  allegedly told  a co-worker  that he\n\nhoped appellant would quit.  Finally, upon hearing an employee of\n\nItalian lineagecough, Walsh reputedly said, \"I hope he chokes.\"  \n\n          This evidence  is manifestly  insufficient to  create a\n\ntrialworthy  issue  regarding  the  existence  of  a  statutorily\n\nproscribed  animus.   To  be  sure,  the attributed  remarks  are\n\nconcededly  coarse     but  there  is  nothing  about them  which\n\nsuggests  to  an   objectively  reasonable  observer   that  they\n\nconstituted  expressions  of  discrimination  based  on  national\n\norigin.   Sporadic instances of  rude behavior, without  more, do\n\nnot comprise competent proof of nationality-based discrimination.\n\nSee, e.g., Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 826; Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 9-\n                                                 \n\n10;  Robinson v.
