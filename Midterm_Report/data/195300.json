While I concur  in both\n                    \n\nthe result  and the  reasoning of  the majority opinion,  I\n\nwrite separately to express  my concern about the potential\n\nthreat to the vaccine compensation program.\n\nBy virtue of the  circumscribed scope of our  authority and\n\nour inherent institutional limitations, we in the  judicial\n\nbranch   must  abide  by  the  presumptions  prescribed  by\n\ntraditional principles of statutory  construction.  At  the\n\nsame  time,  I  cannot   ignore  the  fact  that,  although\n\ncompelled  by  law,  the  panel's  decision  heightens  the\n\ntension between  the two competing purposes  of the vaccine\n\ncompensation  program:    holding  down  vaccine prices  by\n\ncutting litigation  costs while ensuring  that the  injured\n\nare  adequately compensated.   The defendant  suggests that\n\nthe  cost-benefit calculus counsels  a different resolution\n\nof the conflict in  the circumstances of cases such  as the\n\npresent one.   Specifically, the defendant  argues that the\n\nincrease in litigation costs associated with compensating a\n\nrelatively  small group of  victims' family members through\n\nstate tort systems will  place at risk a much  larger group\n\nof unvaccinated individuals due to price sensitivity in the\n\nvaccine market.   I consider this to  be an issue of  great\n\nimportance,  apparently overlooked  at  the  time  Congress\n\ndrafted the statute.   I respectfully suggest that  this is\n\nan issue which Congress may wish to revisit.\n\n               UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                   FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                        \n\nNo. 93-1422\n\n             MARK SCHAFER AND MELISSA SCHAFER,\n                   A MINOR BY AND THROUGH\nMARK SCHAFER, NATURAL PARENT AND GUARDIAN OF MELISSA SCHAFER,\n\n                   Plaintiffs, Appellees,\n\n                             v.\n\n              AMERICAN CYANAMID CO., PARENT OF\n LEDERLE LABORATORIES, A DIVISION OF AMERICAN CYANAMID CO.,\n\n                   Defendant, Appellant.\n\n                                        \n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n      [Hon.

The Act bars those who accept\n\nan award  under that  procedure from  later bringing  a tort\n\nsuit to obtain additional  compensation.  Id.   300aa-21(a).\n                                             \n\nThe question before  us in  this appeal (under  28 U.S.C.   \n\n1292(b)) is whether the  Act also bars the family  of such a\n\nperson from  bringing a tort suit to obtain compensation for\n\ntheir  own, related,  injuries, in  particular, for  loss of\n\ncompanionship  or  consortium.    Assuming  that  state  law\n\npermits  such  suits,  we  find  nothing  in  the  Act  that\n\nexplicitly or  implicitly bars  them.   And,  we affirm  the\n\nsimilar determination of the district court.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n                             A\n\n                        The Statute\n                                   \n\n          The   National   Childhood   Vaccine  Injury   Act\n\nrepresents an effort to provide compensation to those harmed\n\nby childhood  vaccines outside the  framework of traditional\n\ntort law.   Congress passed the law  after hearing testimony\n\n1)  describing the  critical  need for  vaccines to  protect\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nchildren   from  disease,  2)  pointing  out  that  vaccines\n\ninevitably  harm a very small number of the many millions of\n\npeople who are vaccinated, and 3) expressing dissatisfaction\n\nwith traditional tort law as a way of compensating those few\n\nvictims.    Injured  persons  (potential   tort  plaintiffs)\n\ncomplained about the tort law system's uncertain recoveries,\n\nthe  high  cost  of  litigation,  and  delays  in  obtaining\n\ncompensation.   They  argued  that government  had, for  all\n\npractical purposes, made vaccination obligatory, and thus it\n\nhad  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  those  injured  by\n\nvaccines were compensated.  Vaccine manufacturers (potential\n\ntort  defendants) complained  about litigation  expenses and\n\noccasional large recoveries, which caused insurance premiums\n\nand vaccine prices to  rise, and which ultimately threatened\n\nthe stability of the vaccine supply.\n\n          See  generally  National Childhood  Vaccine Injury\n                                                            \n\nCompensation Act of 1985: Hearing on S.827 Before the Senate\n                                                            \n\nComm. on  Labor and Human  Resources, 99th Cong.,  1st Sess.\n                                    \n\npt.  2  (1985) [hereinafter  \"Hearings  on  S.827\"]; Vaccine\n                                                            \n\nInjury   Compensation:  Hearings  on   H.R.5810  Before  the\n                                                            \n\nSubcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm. on\n                                                            \n\nEnergy   and   Commerce,  98th   Cong.,   2d  Sess.

News &amp;\n                                         \n\nJ. 452 (1990).\n\n          The Vaccine  Act responds to  these complaints  by\n\ncreating  a  remedial  system  that tries  more  quickly  to\n\ndeliver  compensation  to   victims,  while  also   reducing\n\ninsurance and  litigation costs for manufacturers.   The Act\n\nestablishes a  special claims procedure involving  the Court\n\nof  Federal  Claims and  special masters  (a system  that we\n\nshall call the  \"Vaccine Court\").  42 U.S.C.    300aa-12.  A\n\nperson injured by  a vaccine  may file a  petition with  the\n\nVaccine Court  to obtain compensation (from  a fund financed\n\nby a  tax on vaccines).  Id.    300aa-11.  He need not prove\n                            \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nfault.  Nor, to prove causation, need he show more than that\n\nhe received  the vaccine and then  suffered certain symptoms\n\nwithin a defined period of time.  Id.    300aa-13, 300aa-14.\n                                     \n\nThe Act specifies amounts  of compensation for certain kinds\n\nof harm (e.g., $250,000  for death, up to $250,000  for pain\n\nand  suffering).    Id.     300aa-15(a)(2),  (4).   And,  it\n                       \n\nspecifies other types  of harm for which compensation may be\n\nawarded (e.g., medical expenses, loss  of earnings).  Id.   \n                                                         \n\n300aa-15(a).\n\n          At the same time,  the Act modifies, but  does not\n\neliminate,  the  traditional  tort  system,  which  Congress\n\nunderstood  to  provide important  incentives  for  the safe\n\nmanufacture and distribution of  vaccines.  The Act requires\n\nthat  a person injured directly  by a vaccine  first bring a\n                                                    \n\nVaccine Court  proceeding.  Id.    300aa-11(a)(2)(A).  Then,\n                               \n\nit gives that person the choice either to accept the Court's\n\naward and abandon his tort  rights (which the Act  transfers\n\nto the  federal government, id.     300aa-17), or  to reject\n                               \n\nthe  judgment and  retain his  tort rights.

(He can  also keep  his tort\n\nrights  by withdrawing  his  Vaccine Court  petition if  the\n\nCourt  moves  too  slowly.

Lenita  Schafer's small  child,  Melissa  Schafer,\n\nreceived  an  oral  polio  vaccine  distributed  by American\n\nCyanamid  in October  1988.  Lenita  subsequently contracted\n\npolio  (she and  her family  think) from  Melissa's vaccine.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nAbout one year later, in December 1989, all three members of\n\nthe Schafer family (Lenita,  Melissa, and Lenita's  husband,\n\nMark)  petitioned the  Vaccine Court  for compensation.   In\n\nApril 1990, Mark and  Melissa withdrew their petitions (with\n\npermission  of the  Vaccine  Court) and  began this  lawsuit\n\nagainst   American   Cyanamid,    seeking   damages    under\n\nMassachusetts tort  law for loss  of Lenita's  companionship\n\nand   consortium.     See  28   U.S.C.      1332  (diversity\n                         \n\njurisdiction); Fletch v. General  Rental Co., 421 N.E.2d 67,\n                                            \n\n70-72  (Mass.  1981).   Lenita,  who  did  not withdraw  her\n\npetition,  eventually accepted  a  $750,000  award from  the\n\nVaccine Court  for her own  injuries, thereby giving  up her\n\nright  to  bring a  tort action.    At that  point, American\n\nCyanamid  asked the  district  court to  dismiss Mark's  and\n\nMelissa's suit on the ground that Lenita's acceptance of the\n\nVaccine  Court award barred not only a later tort action for\n\nher own injuries,  but also  a later tort  action by  family\n\nmembers for related injuries.  The district court denied the\n\nmotion.  We  review that  denial under the  authority of  28\n\nU.S.C.   1292(b) (permitting appeal of  interlocutory orders\n\nraising certain controlling questions of law).\n\n                             II\n\n                     The Basic Argument\n                                       \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          Cyanamid  concedes that  this  case  focuses  upon\n\nMark's  and  Melissa's  damages, not  Lenita's;  that Lenita\n\nreceived Vaccine Court compensation for her own damages, not\n\nMark's or Melissa's; and  that the Act's language explicitly\n\nbars Lenita, but not  Mark or Melissa, from bringing  a tort\n\naction to recover their own damages (which, we specify, will\n\nnot  duplicate Lenita's).   Nonetheless,  it argues  that to\n\npermit Mark or Melissa  to bring their own tort  action (for\n\nrelated damages) would so seriously interfere with the Act's\n\nbasic  purposes  that we  must  read the  Act  as implicitly\n                                                            \n\nbarring those actions, just  as it explicitly bars Lenita's.\n\nAlthough Cyanamid's  counsel wants to call  its argument one\n\nof \"interpreting the Act  in light of its basic  policy,\" we\n\nbelieve that \"pre-emption\" is a better, alternative,  label.\n\nThe argument seems to  amount to a claim that the  state law\n\nthat permits Mark  or Melissa to bring this  kind of suit so\n\nsignificantly interferes  with the federal Act's  ability to\n\nachieve   its    important   federal   purpose    that   the\n\nConstitution's Supremacy Clause  requires the  state law  to\n\nyield  to the federal  law's implicit demand.

But, however one characterizes the argument,\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nit  has  two  essential  elements --  an  important  federal\n\npurpose and a significant state interference.  And, we shall\n\ntry to set  forth these two elements  of Cyanamid's argument\n\nin  light   of  the   Act's  legislative  history,   and  as\n\npersuasively as possible.\n\n          First, an important federal  purpose of the Act is\n\nto free  manufacturers from the specter  of large, uncertain\n\ntort liability,  and thereby keep vaccine  prices fairly low\n\nand keep manufactures in  the market.  Vaccine manufacturers\n\npresented Congress  with evidence that their  tort insurance\n\nand  litigation  costs  had  begun to  dwarf  their  vaccine\n\nproduction revenues.   See Hearings on S.827,  supra, at 240\n                                                    \n\n(discussing difficulty of obtaining insurance) (statement of\n\nRobert  Johnson);  Hearings  on  H.R.5810,  supra,  at   229\n                                                 \n\n(expected liability costs  hundreds of times  annual vaccine\n\nsales  revenue) (statement  of  Robert  Johnson);  Childhood\n                                                            \n\nImmunizations,  supra,  at  88  (expected  insurance premium\n                     \n\nincrease  of 50 to  300 percent).   They  argued that,  as a\n\nresult,   some   manufacturers   had  discontinued   vaccine\n\nproduction (leaving  only  a handful  of  producers),  while\n\nothers had  raised their vaccine prices  significantly.  See\n                                                            \n\nChildhood  Immunizations, supra, at 63 (showing increases in\n                               \n\nDPT vaccine from  10 cents  to three dollars  per dose,  and\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npolio  vaccine from  35 cents  to a  dollar and  a half  per\n\ndose).\n\n          Evidence  in  the  hearing record  indicated  that\n\ncompensation-related   price   increases   or   manufacturer\n\nwithdrawal would cause serious harm.  Vaccines benefit those\n\nwho are vaccinated, and they have public benefits as well --\n\nwhen parents  vaccinate their  own children, they  also help\n\nstop the spread of  a disease that can injure  others.  And,\n\neven  though vaccines  themselves  cause a  small number  of\n\nserious   injuries   or   deaths,   their   widespread   use\n\ndramatically  reduces  fatalities.   For  example,  the  DPT\n\nvaccine  itself may  cause 150  or so  incidents of  serious\n\nneurological damage  and the polio vaccine  may itself cause\n\nabout five annual  incidents of paralysis.   See OTA Report,\n                                                \n\nsupra, at 51.   But, before widespread vaccination, whooping\n     \n\ncough, for example, killed  about 7,500 (mostly) children in\n\na  single year,  diphtheria killed  about 15,000,  and polio\n\ninjured, paralyzed,  or killed about 57,000.   See Childhood\n                                                            \n\nImmunizations,  supra, at 1, 6, 14.  Thus, despite the price\n                     \n\nto   be   paid   in   vaccine-caused   injuries,  widespread\n\nvaccination  -- (about  13.5  million annual  diphtheria and\n\nwhooping cough  (DPT) vaccine doses, about  18 million polio\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndoses)  --  has   virtually  wiped  out   these  devastating\n\ndiseases. \n\n          The upshot  is that,  because vaccines  benefit so\n\nmany (and harm so few), even small vaccine price  increases,\n\nif followed  by even  a small  decline in  vaccinations, can\n\ncause  more public harm through added  disease than the sum-\n\ntotal  of all  the  harm vaccines  themselves cause  through\n\nside-effects.   See, e.g.,  Hauptly &amp;  Mason, supra,  at 452\n                                                   \n\n(recounting how,  in Japan, two deaths from DPT side effects\n\nled  to withdrawal of the  vaccine, which was  followed by a\n\nwhooping cough  epidemic  that killed  forty-one  children).\n\nFor this  kind of  reason, the  argument goes,  Congress was\n\nimportantly motivated not only  by the desire effectively to\n\ncompensate side-effect  victims, but  also by the  desire to\n\nkeep  vaccine  prices fairly  low  by reducing  compensation\n\ncosts.  See, e.g.,  Hearings on S.827, supra, at  5 (remarks\n                                            \n\nof Sen. Hawkins); Hearings on S.2117, supra, at 5 (statement\n                                           \n\nof  Sen.  Grassley);  Vaccine  Act Report,  supra,  at  4-7,\n                                                 \n\nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6345-48.\n            \n\n          Second,  the availability of  a state  tort remedy\n\nfor relatives of a victim  interferes with the Act's efforts\n\nto lower manufacturers' costs.  The Act seeks to achieve its\n\ncost-reducing  purpose,  not  by  denying   compensation  to\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nvictims  (indeed, it imposes a tax upon vaccines in order to\n\nfund  compensation), but  by  reducing  the  litigation  and\n\ninsurance costs related to  lengthy, complex tort procedures\n\nand  random large  tort awards.   The Act  therefore imposes\n\nsubstantive  and procedural  limitations upon  tort actions.\n\nAnd, more importantly, it discourages victims  from bringing\n\nthose traditional  tort cases by  providing fairly generous,\n\nmore easily obtainable, Vaccine Court awards.   A victim who\n\nobtains such an  award may hesitate to give up  that bird in\n\nthe  hand in return for a larger, but more speculative, tort\n\nlaw  award.   And, a  petitioner to  whom the  Vaccine Court\n\ngives  nothing may see no  point in trying  to overcome tort\n\nlaw's yet more serious obstacles to recovery.\n\n          But, Cyanamid points out, almost every victim  has\n\na family.   And, almost  every vaccine-related  injury to  a\n\nchild will adversely  affect the  life of that  family.   In\n\nCyanamid's view, if family members can bring a tort suit for\n\nloss of say, a  child's companionship, even after the  child\n\naccepts a Vaccine Court award, they will do so.\n\n          Cyanamid then says (and this is the most difficult\n\npart  of  Cyanamid's argument)  that  to  permit a  victim's\n\nfamily  to bring  a tort law  case -- even  where the victim\n\nobtains  a Vaccine  Court  award --  threatens seriously  to\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nundermine the Act's  \"cost-related\" advantages.   The result\n\nwill  be a system in  which manufacturers must  pay both the\n                                                        \n\nVaccine Court's easily-obtained compensation awards (through\n\na  tax) and also face large tort claims from family members.\n                \n\nThe  latter means  the very  kind of  large occasional  tort\n\nawards and the kind of litigation costs that  Congress hoped\n\nto  diminish.   Cyanamid concludes  that the  Act implicitly\n                                                            \n\nmust hold family members to the election  of the physically-\n\ninjured victim.  If that victim receives an award and can no\n\nlonger pursue a court  claim, then neither can  the victim's\n\nfamily.\n\n                            III\n\n                        Our Response\n                                    \n\n          Cyanamid's  argument  is  not  without  force, but\n\nultimately  it does not persuade  us, either as  a matter of\n\nstatutory  interpretation or  in terms  of  pre-emption law.\n\nFirst, one  cannot easily interpret the  statute as Cyanamid\n\nwishes,  for the Act  has no language at  all that one might\n\nread as creating a  bar to the type  of suit before us.   To\n\nthe  contrary,  the Act  subsection  that  creates the  tort\n\naction  bar says  that  it does  not apply  to this  kind of\n\nlawsuit.  The language that creates the bar,    300aa-11(a),\n\nsays: \"[n]o  person may  bring a  civil action  for damages\"\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n(except in accordance  with the Act's  Vaccine-Court-related\n\nrules)  until a Vaccine Court petition \"has been filed.\"  It\n\nthen states  specifically that \"this subsection\"   (i.e. the\n\nsubsection with the tort action bar):\n\n          applies   only  to  a   person  who  has\n                                        \n          sustained  a  vaccine-related injury  or\n          death and  who  is qualified  to file  a\n                                                  \n          petition  for   compensation  under  the\n                                                  \n          Program.\n                 \n\n42 U.S.C.   300aa-11(a)(9) (emphasis  added).  A person  \"is\n\nqualified to file a petition\" only if that person suffered a\n\nrelevant injury or death after he or she \"received a vaccine\n\n. . . or  contracted polio from another person  who received\n\nan oral polio vaccine.\"   Id.   300aa-11(c)(1)(A).   That is\n                             \n\nto say, unless a person \"received a vaccine\" or, like Lenita\n\nSchafer,  caught polio from someone who did (or is the legal\n\nrepresentative of such a person), he cannot file a petition.\n\nSee,  e.g., Head v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 26\n                                                        \n\nCl.  Ct. 546, 547 n.1 (1992) (parent of injured child cannot\n\npetition except in representative capacity), aff'd, 996 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n318 (Fed.  Cir. 1993).   And, if he  cannot file a  petition\n\nwith the Vaccine Court, the Act  says that its tort suit ban\n\ndoes not apply to him.\n\n          Moreover, this same language suggests that the Act\n\nsees  the  tort  suit   procedural  bar  and  Vaccine  Court\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\ncompensation  as opposite sides of  the same coin.   Yet the\n\nAct  does not permit  compensation for injuries  to a family\n\nmember  (of  the direct  victim  who  takes the  vaccine  or\n\ncatches polio from a vaccine taker).  Indeed, it prohibits:\n\n          compensation for other than  the health,\n          education,  or welfare of the person who\n          suffered the vaccine-related injury with\n          respect  to  which  the compensation  is\n          paid.\n\nId.    300aa-15(d)(2).   And, the  Vaccine Court  itself has\n   \n\ninterpreted   this  section   as   forbidding  payment   for\n\npsychological  counseling for  a victim's  family unless  it\n\ndirectly benefits the  victim herself.  See, e.g.,  Huber v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary  of Health and Human  Servs., 22 Cl.

The legislative history says nothing at\n\nall  about family members'  tort suits.   Its  discussion of\n\ngeneral purposes, as we have pointed out above, see pp. 2-4,\n                                                   \n\nsupra,  indicates  two  major  purposes,  namely,  providing\n                      \n\ncompensation for victims and  maintaining low vaccine costs.\n\nHow  does Cyanamid's  argument take  account of  the \"victim\n\ncompensation\" objective?  Because the Vaccine Court does not\n\nprovide a  remedy for  family members, to  accept Cyanamid's\n\nargument would require us to conclude that Congress, without\n\nanyone saying a  word about it,  intended to deprive  family\n\nmembers of all compensatory remedies.  At the same time, the\n\nsecond  leg  of  Cyanamid's   argument  --  the  claim  that\n\npermitting this kind  of suit would significantly  interfere\n\nwith Congress's  cost control  objective -- has  no specific\n\nempirical support in the  legislative record; and, the claim\n\ndoes not prove itself.  Given the difficulties of prevailing\n\nin  a traditional tort suit,  it is, at  least, unclear that\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nplaintiff families --  particularly families of  victims who\n\nhave  already received  Vaccine  Act  compensation  --  will\n\nprevail so  often, and  obtain verdicts  so large,  that the\n\njury  awards,   or  the   threat  of  those   awards,  would\n\nsignificantly  raise   vaccine   prices  or   retard   their\n\ndistribution.\n\n          The legislative record's  silence may reflect  the\n\nvaccine manufacturers' view that family suits do  not pose a\n\nparticular  practical  problem,  or   the  failure  of   any\n\ninterested person to think about the matter, or a calculated\n\ndecision   by  everyone   to   ignore  the   issue  in   the\n\ncongressional  hearings  for fear  of upsetting  a carefully\n\ncrafted compromise.   But, regardless of the  reason for the\n\nsilence, our very uncertainty  about how Congress would have\n\nanswered the question means that Cyanamid has failed to show\n\nthat this kind of  action significantly undermines the Act's\n\ngiven objectives.\n\n          Third, to  accept Cyanamid's argument --  that the\n\nSchafer family cannot collect both a Vaccine Court award and\n\nloss  of consortium  tort damages  -- would  create judicial\n\ninconsistency.  The Vaccine Court has held that a parent can\n                                                            \n\nboth  obtain a loss of consortium \"award\" from a state court\n\n(or the settlement  of a  state law claim)  and also  obtain\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ncompensation for her vaccinated (and injured) child from the\n\nVaccine  Court.

Pre-emption  law, for  example,\n\ncautions us  against finding  that a congressional  act pre-\n\nempts a state law  through silence.  Maryland  v.

Congress passed the law  after hearing testimony\n\n1)  describing the  critical  need for  vaccines to  protect\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nchildren   from  disease,  2)  pointing  out  that  vaccines\n\ninevitably  harm a very small number of the many millions of\n\npeople who are vaccinated, and 3) expressing dissatisfaction\n\nwith traditional tort law as a way of compensating those few\n\nvictims.    Injured  persons  (potential   tort  plaintiffs)\n\ncomplained about the tort law system's uncertain recoveries,\n\nthe  high  cost  of  litigation,  and  delays  in  obtaining\n\ncompensation.   They  argued  that government  had, for  all\n\npractical purposes, made vaccination obligatory, and thus it\n\nhad  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  those  injured  by\n\nvaccines were compensated.  Vaccine manufacturers (potential\n\ntort  defendants) complained  about litigation  expenses and\n\noccasional large recoveries, which caused insurance premiums\n\nand vaccine prices to  rise, and which ultimately threatened\n\nthe stability of the vaccine supply.\n\n          See  generally  National Childhood  Vaccine Injury\n                                                            \n\nCompensation Act of 1985: Hearing on S.827 Before the Senate\n                                                            \n\nComm. on  Labor and Human  Resources, 99th Cong.,  1st Sess.\n                                    \n\npt.  2  (1985) [hereinafter  \"Hearings  on  S.827\"]; Vaccine\n                                                            \n\nInjury   Compensation:  Hearings  on   H.R.5810  Before  the\n                                                            \n\nSubcomm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm. on\n                                                            \n\nEnergy   and   Commerce,  98th   Cong.,   2d  Sess.

The Act\n\nestablishes a  special claims procedure involving  the Court\n\nof  Federal  Claims and  special masters  (a system  that we\n\nshall call the  \"Vaccine Court\").  42 U.S.C.    300aa-12.  A\n\nperson injured by  a vaccine  may file a  petition with  the\n\nVaccine Court  to obtain compensation (from  a fund financed\n\nby a  tax on vaccines).  Id.    300aa-11.  He need not prove\n                            \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nfault.  Nor, to prove causation, need he show more than that\n\nhe received  the vaccine and then  suffered certain symptoms\n\nwithin a defined period of time.  Id.    300aa-13, 300aa-14.\n                                     \n\nThe Act specifies amounts  of compensation for certain kinds\n\nof harm (e.g., $250,000  for death, up to $250,000  for pain\n\nand  suffering).    Id.     300aa-15(a)(2),  (4).   And,  it\n                       \n\nspecifies other types  of harm for which compensation may be\n\nawarded (e.g., medical expenses, loss  of earnings).  Id.   \n                                                         \n\n300aa-15(a).\n\n          At the same time,  the Act modifies, but  does not\n\neliminate,  the  traditional  tort  system,  which  Congress\n\nunderstood  to  provide important  incentives  for  the safe\n\nmanufacture and distribution of  vaccines.  The Act requires\n\nthat  a person injured directly  by a vaccine  first bring a\n                                                    \n\nVaccine Court  proceeding.  Id.    300aa-11(a)(2)(A).  Then,\n                               \n\nit gives that person the choice either to accept the Court's\n\naward and abandon his tort  rights (which the Act  transfers\n\nto the  federal government, id.     300aa-17), or  to reject\n                               \n\nthe  judgment and  retain his  tort rights.

Lenita  Schafer's small  child,  Melissa  Schafer,\n\nreceived  an  oral  polio  vaccine  distributed  by American\n\nCyanamid  in October  1988.  Lenita  subsequently contracted\n\npolio  (she and  her family  think) from  Melissa's vaccine.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nAbout one year later, in December 1989, all three members of\n\nthe Schafer family (Lenita,  Melissa, and Lenita's  husband,\n\nMark)  petitioned the  Vaccine Court  for compensation.   In\n\nApril 1990, Mark and  Melissa withdrew their petitions (with\n\npermission  of the  Vaccine  Court) and  began this  lawsuit\n\nagainst   American   Cyanamid,    seeking   damages    under\n\nMassachusetts tort  law for loss  of Lenita's  companionship\n\nand   consortium.     See  28   U.S.C.      1332  (diversity\n                         \n\njurisdiction); Fletch v.

Lenita,  who  did  not withdraw  her\n\npetition,  eventually accepted  a  $750,000  award from  the\n\nVaccine Court  for her own  injuries, thereby giving  up her\n\nright  to  bring a  tort action.    At that  point, American\n\nCyanamid  asked the  district  court to  dismiss Mark's  and\n\nMelissa's suit on the ground that Lenita's acceptance of the\n\nVaccine  Court award barred not only a later tort action for\n\nher own injuries,  but also  a later tort  action by  family\n\nmembers for related injuries.  The district court denied the\n\nmotion.  We  review that  denial under the  authority of  28\n\nU.S.C.   1292(b) (permitting appeal of  interlocutory orders\n\nraising certain controlling questions of law).\n\n                             II\n\n                     The Basic Argument\n                                       \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          Cyanamid  concedes that  this  case  focuses  upon\n\nMark's  and  Melissa's  damages, not  Lenita's;  that Lenita\n\nreceived Vaccine Court compensation for her own damages, not\n\nMark's or Melissa's; and  that the Act's language explicitly\n\nbars Lenita, but not  Mark or Melissa, from bringing  a tort\n\naction to recover their own damages (which, we specify, will\n\nnot  duplicate Lenita's).   Nonetheless,  it argues  that to\n\npermit Mark or Melissa  to bring their own tort  action (for\n\nrelated damages) would so seriously interfere with the Act's\n\nbasic  purposes  that we  must  read the  Act  as implicitly\n                                                            \n\nbarring those actions, just  as it explicitly bars Lenita's.\n\nAlthough Cyanamid's  counsel wants to call  its argument one\n\nof \"interpreting the Act  in light of its basic  policy,\" we\n\nbelieve that \"pre-emption\" is a better, alternative,  label.\n\nThe argument seems to  amount to a claim that the  state law\n\nthat permits Mark  or Melissa to bring this  kind of suit so\n\nsignificantly interferes  with the federal Act's  ability to\n\nachieve   its    important   federal   purpose    that   the\n\nConstitution's Supremacy Clause  requires the  state law  to\n\nyield  to the federal  law's implicit demand.

But, however one characterizes the argument,\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nit  has  two  essential  elements --  an  important  federal\n\npurpose and a significant state interference.  And, we shall\n\ntry to set  forth these two elements  of Cyanamid's argument\n\nin  light   of  the   Act's  legislative  history,   and  as\n\npersuasively as possible.\n\n          First, an important federal  purpose of the Act is\n\nto free  manufacturers from the specter  of large, uncertain\n\ntort liability,  and thereby keep vaccine  prices fairly low\n\nand keep manufactures in  the market.  Vaccine manufacturers\n\npresented Congress  with evidence that their  tort insurance\n\nand  litigation  costs  had  begun to  dwarf  their  vaccine\n\nproduction revenues.   See Hearings on S.827,  supra, at 240\n                                                    \n\n(discussing difficulty of obtaining insurance) (statement of\n\nRobert  Johnson);  Hearings  on  H.R.5810,  supra,  at   229\n                                                 \n\n(expected liability costs  hundreds of times  annual vaccine\n\nsales  revenue) (statement  of  Robert  Johnson);  Childhood\n                                                            \n\nImmunizations,  supra,  at  88  (expected  insurance premium\n                     \n\nincrease  of 50 to  300 percent).   They  argued that,  as a\n\nresult,   some   manufacturers   had  discontinued   vaccine\n\nproduction (leaving  only  a handful  of  producers),  while\n\nothers had  raised their vaccine prices  significantly.  See\n                                                            \n\nChildhood  Immunizations, supra, at 63 (showing increases in\n                               \n\nDPT vaccine from  10 cents  to three dollars  per dose,  and\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npolio  vaccine from  35 cents  to a  dollar and  a half  per\n\ndose).\n\n          Evidence  in  the  hearing record  indicated  that\n\ncompensation-related   price   increases   or   manufacturer\n\nwithdrawal would cause serious harm.  Vaccines benefit those\n\nwho are vaccinated, and they have public benefits as well --\n\nwhen parents  vaccinate their  own children, they  also help\n\nstop the spread of  a disease that can injure  others.  And,\n\neven  though vaccines  themselves  cause a  small number  of\n\nserious   injuries   or   deaths,   their   widespread   use\n\ndramatically  reduces  fatalities.   For  example,  the  DPT\n\nvaccine  itself may  cause 150  or so  incidents of  serious\n\nneurological damage  and the polio vaccine  may itself cause\n\nabout five annual  incidents of paralysis.   See OTA Report,\n                                                \n\nsupra, at 51.   But, before widespread vaccination, whooping\n     \n\ncough, for example, killed  about 7,500 (mostly) children in\n\na  single year,  diphtheria killed  about 15,000,  and polio\n\ninjured, paralyzed,  or killed about 57,000.   See Childhood\n                                                            \n\nImmunizations,  supra, at 1, 6, 14.  Thus, despite the price\n                     \n\nto   be   paid   in   vaccine-caused   injuries,  widespread\n\nvaccination  -- (about  13.5  million annual  diphtheria and\n\nwhooping cough  (DPT) vaccine doses, about  18 million polio\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndoses)  --  has   virtually  wiped  out   these  devastating\n\ndiseases. \n\n          The upshot  is that,  because vaccines  benefit so\n\nmany (and harm so few), even small vaccine price  increases,\n\nif followed  by even  a small  decline in  vaccinations, can\n\ncause  more public harm through added  disease than the sum-\n\ntotal  of all  the  harm vaccines  themselves cause  through\n\nside-effects.   See, e.g.,  Hauptly &amp;  Mason, supra,  at 452\n                                                   \n\n(recounting how,  in Japan, two deaths from DPT side effects\n\nled  to withdrawal of the  vaccine, which was  followed by a\n\nwhooping cough  epidemic  that killed  forty-one  children).\n\nFor this  kind of  reason, the  argument goes,  Congress was\n\nimportantly motivated not only  by the desire effectively to\n\ncompensate side-effect  victims, but  also by the  desire to\n\nkeep  vaccine  prices fairly  low  by reducing  compensation\n\ncosts.  See, e.g.,  Hearings on S.827, supra, at  5 (remarks\n                                            \n\nof Sen. Hawkins); Hearings on S.2117, supra, at 5 (statement\n                                           \n\nof  Sen.  Grassley);  Vaccine  Act Report,  supra,  at  4-7,\n                                                 \n\nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6345-48.\n            \n\n          Second,  the availability of  a state  tort remedy\n\nfor relatives of a victim  interferes with the Act's efforts\n\nto lower manufacturers' costs.  The Act seeks to achieve its\n\ncost-reducing  purpose,  not  by  denying   compensation  to\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nvictims  (indeed, it imposes a tax upon vaccines in order to\n\nfund  compensation), but  by  reducing  the  litigation  and\n\ninsurance costs related to  lengthy, complex tort procedures\n\nand  random large  tort awards.   The Act  therefore imposes\n\nsubstantive  and procedural  limitations upon  tort actions.\n\nAnd, more importantly, it discourages victims  from bringing\n\nthose traditional  tort cases by  providing fairly generous,\n\nmore easily obtainable, Vaccine Court awards.   A victim who\n\nobtains such an  award may hesitate to give up  that bird in\n\nthe  hand in return for a larger, but more speculative, tort\n\nlaw  award.   And, a  petitioner to  whom the  Vaccine Court\n\ngives  nothing may see no  point in trying  to overcome tort\n\nlaw's yet more serious obstacles to recovery.\n\n          But, Cyanamid points out, almost every victim  has\n\na family.   And, almost  every vaccine-related  injury to  a\n\nchild will adversely  affect the  life of that  family.   In\n\nCyanamid's view, if family members can bring a tort suit for\n\nloss of say, a  child's companionship, even after the  child\n\naccepts a Vaccine Court award, they will do so.\n\n          Cyanamid then says (and this is the most difficult\n\npart  of  Cyanamid's argument)  that  to  permit a  victim's\n\nfamily  to bring  a tort law  case -- even  where the victim\n\nobtains  a Vaccine  Court  award --  threatens seriously  to\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nundermine the Act's  \"cost-related\" advantages.   The result\n\nwill  be a system in  which manufacturers must  pay both the\n                                                        \n\nVaccine Court's easily-obtained compensation awards (through\n\na  tax) and also face large tort claims from family members.\n                \n\nThe  latter means  the very  kind of  large occasional  tort\n\nawards and the kind of litigation costs that  Congress hoped\n\nto  diminish.   Cyanamid concludes  that the  Act implicitly\n                                                            \n\nmust hold family members to the election  of the physically-\n\ninjured victim.  If that victim receives an award and can no\n\nlonger pursue a court  claim, then neither can  the victim's\n\nfamily.\n\n                            III\n\n                        Our Response\n                                    \n\n          Cyanamid's  argument  is  not  without  force, but\n\nultimately  it does not persuade  us, either as  a matter of\n\nstatutory  interpretation or  in terms  of  pre-emption law.\n\nFirst, one  cannot easily interpret the  statute as Cyanamid\n\nwishes,  for the Act  has no language at  all that one might\n\nread as creating a  bar to the type  of suit before us.   To\n\nthe  contrary,  the Act  subsection  that  creates the  tort\n\naction  bar says  that  it does  not apply  to this  kind of\n\nlawsuit.  The language that creates the bar,    300aa-11(a),\n\nsays: \"[n]o  person may  bring a  civil action  for damages\"\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n(except in accordance  with the Act's  Vaccine-Court-related\n\nrules)  until a Vaccine Court petition \"has been filed.\"  It\n\nthen states  specifically that \"this subsection\"   (i.e. the\n\nsubsection with the tort action bar):\n\n          applies   only  to  a   person  who  has\n                                        \n          sustained  a  vaccine-related injury  or\n          death and  who  is qualified  to file  a\n                                                  \n          petition  for   compensation  under  the\n                                                  \n          Program.\n                 \n\n42 U.S.C.   300aa-11(a)(9) (emphasis  added).  A person  \"is\n\nqualified to file a petition\" only if that person suffered a\n\nrelevant injury or death after he or she \"received a vaccine\n\n. . . or  contracted polio from another person  who received\n\nan oral polio vaccine.\"   Id.   300aa-11(c)(1)(A).   That is\n                             \n\nto say, unless a person \"received a vaccine\" or, like Lenita\n\nSchafer,  caught polio from someone who did (or is the legal\n\nrepresentative of such a person), he cannot file a petition.\n\nSee,  e.g., Head v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 26\n                                                        \n\nCl.

Cir. 1993).   And, if he  cannot file a  petition\n\nwith the Vaccine Court, the Act  says that its tort suit ban\n\ndoes not apply to him.\n\n          Moreover, this same language suggests that the Act\n\nsees  the  tort  suit   procedural  bar  and  Vaccine  Court\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\ncompensation  as opposite sides of  the same coin.   Yet the\n\nAct  does not permit  compensation for injuries  to a family\n\nmember  (of  the direct  victim  who  takes the  vaccine  or\n\ncatches polio from a vaccine taker).  Indeed, it prohibits:\n\n          compensation for other than  the health,\n          education,  or welfare of the person who\n          suffered the vaccine-related injury with\n          respect  to  which  the compensation  is\n          paid.\n\nId.    300aa-15(d)(2).   And, the  Vaccine Court  itself has\n   \n\ninterpreted   this  section   as   forbidding  payment   for\n\npsychological  counseling for  a victim's  family unless  it\n\ndirectly benefits the  victim herself.  See, e.g.,  Huber v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary  of Health and Human  Servs., 22 Cl.

LEXIS 64, at *5 (U.S. Claims Ct., Feb. 1, 1990)\n\n(same);  cf.  42  U.S.C.    300aa-14  (list  of  compensable\n            \n\ninjuries containing no reference to the kind of harm here at\n\nissue).\n\n          Second, the  Act's  legislative history  does  not\n\npoint directly toward the \"policy\" conclusion  that Cyanamid\n\nwishes  us to draw.  The legislative history says nothing at\n\nall  about family members'  tort suits.   Its  discussion of\n\ngeneral purposes, as we have pointed out above, see pp. 2-4,\n                                                   \n\nsupra,  indicates  two  major  purposes,  namely,  providing\n                      \n\ncompensation for victims and  maintaining low vaccine costs.\n\nHow  does Cyanamid's  argument take  account of  the \"victim\n\ncompensation\" objective?  Because the Vaccine Court does not\n\nprovide a  remedy for  family members, to  accept Cyanamid's\n\nargument would require us to conclude that Congress, without\n\nanyone saying a  word about it,  intended to deprive  family\n\nmembers of all compensatory remedies.  At the same time, the\n\nsecond  leg  of  Cyanamid's   argument  --  the  claim  that\n\npermitting this kind  of suit would significantly  interfere\n\nwith Congress's  cost control  objective -- has  no specific\n\nempirical support in the  legislative record; and, the claim\n\ndoes not prove itself.  Given the difficulties of prevailing\n\nin  a traditional tort suit,  it is, at  least, unclear that\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nplaintiff families --  particularly families of  victims who\n\nhave  already received  Vaccine  Act  compensation  --  will\n\nprevail so  often, and  obtain verdicts  so large,  that the\n\njury  awards,   or  the   threat  of  those   awards,  would\n\nsignificantly  raise   vaccine   prices  or   retard   their\n\ndistribution.\n\n          The legislative record's  silence may reflect  the\n\nvaccine manufacturers' view that family suits do  not pose a\n\nparticular  practical  problem,  or   the  failure  of   any\n\ninterested person to think about the matter, or a calculated\n\ndecision   by  everyone   to   ignore  the   issue  in   the\n\ncongressional  hearings  for fear  of upsetting  a carefully\n\ncrafted compromise.   But, regardless of the  reason for the\n\nsilence, our very uncertainty  about how Congress would have\n\nanswered the question means that Cyanamid has failed to show\n\nthat this kind of  action significantly undermines the Act's\n\ngiven objectives.\n\n          Third, to  accept Cyanamid's argument --  that the\n\nSchafer family cannot collect both a Vaccine Court award and\n\nloss  of consortium  tort damages  -- would  create judicial\n\ninconsistency.  The Vaccine Court has held that a parent can\n                                                            \n\nboth  obtain a loss of consortium \"award\" from a state court\n\n(or the settlement  of a  state law claim)  and also  obtain\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ncompensation for her vaccinated (and injured) child from the\n\nVaccine  Court.

It is  sufficient\n\nthat the Act's  purposes do not point  strongly towards pre-\n\nemption, and the Act's language suggests that pre-emption is\n\nnot intended.  Consequently, Cyanamid's arguments are better\n\nmade to  Congress than  to this  court.   We agree with  the\n\ndistrict court that  the Act, as currently written, does not\n\nbar  the suit before us (described on pp. 7-8, supra).

While  I\n                                   \n\nconcur in both the result and the reasoning of the majority\n\nopinion, I write separately to express my concern about the\n\npotential threat to the vaccine compensation program.\n\n               By  virtue of the circumscribed  scope of our\n\nauthority and our inherent institutional limitations, we in\n\nthe  judicial   branch  must  abide  by   the  presumptions\n\nprescribed   by   traditional   principles   of   statutory\n\nconstruction.  At the  same time, I cannot ignore  the fact\n\nthat,  although  compelled  by  law,  the  panel's decision\n\nheightens the tension between the two competing purposes of\n\nthe  vaccine compensation  program:   holding  down vaccine\n\nprices by cutting litigation  costs while ensuring that the\n\ninjured are adequately compensated.  The defendant suggests\n\nthat  the   cost-benefit  calculus  counsels   a  different\n\nresolution of  the conflict  in the circumstances  of cases\n\nsuch  as  the present  one.    Specifically, the  defendant\n\nargues that  the increase  in  litigation costs  associated\n\nwith  compensating  a  relatively small  group  of victims'\n\nfamily  members through  state tort  systems will  place at\n\nrisk a much larger group of unvaccinated individuals due to\n\nprice sensitivity  in the vaccine market.   I consider this\n\nto be  an issue of great  importance, apparently overlooked\n\nat  the time Congress drafted the  statute.  I respectfully\n\nsuggest  that this is an  issue which Congress  may wish to\n\nrevisit.\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n</pre>",
