Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Lipez, Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Irma R.

As framed by the parties, this\n\nappeal poses two questions.        The first concerns the preclusive\n\neffect, if any, of a waiver-of-appeal provision with respect to an\n\norder for restitution.    The second concerns the appropriateness of\n\nthe order itself.      We bypass the first question and uphold the\n\norder on the merits.\n\n            The background events are easily recounted. On March 20,\n\n2008, defendant-appellant Edgardo Salas-Fernández pleaded guilty to\n\ncounts charging him with violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii), respectively.          His plea entailed an admission\n\nthat he had taken part in the armed robbery of a Loomis-Fargo bank\n\ntruck, using a firearm and threats of violence.\n\n            The defendant tendered his guilty plea pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement   that   contained   a   waiver-of-appeal   provision.   That\n\nprovision read:\n\n            The defendant hereby agrees that if this\n            Honorable Court accepts this agreement and\n            sentences him according to its terms and\n            conditions, defendant waives and surrenders\n            his right to appeal the judgment and sentence\n            in this case.\n\nThe plea agreement also included a section labeled \"Fines and\n\nRestitution,\" but that section did not specify any restitutionary\n\namount.   Indeed, apart from that title, no mention of restitution\n\nappeared anywhere in the entire document.\n\n            Benedict Spinoza famously said, more than three centuries\n\nago, that \"[n]ature abhors a vacuum.\"       It is therefore unsurprising\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthat the presentence investigation report (PSI Report) did address\n\nthe possibility of restitution.           Pertinently, it recommended that\n\nthe   district   court    order   the    defendant   to   pay,    \"jointly   and\n\nseverally\" with five accomplices, the sum of $944,225,1 which sum\n\nrepresented the unrecovered proceeds of the robbery.               Neither the\n\ndefendant's sentencing memorandum nor his objections to the PSI\n\nReport addressed this recommendation.\n\n            On June 27, 2008, the district court sentenced the\n\ndefendant to consecutive prison terms of forty-one and sixty-seven\n\nmonths on the two counts of conviction.           Even though neither side\n\nhad breathed a word about restitution, the court ordered the\n\ndefendant   to   pay     $157,370.83     in   restitution    to   Loomis-Fargo\n\n\"forthwith.\"     The defendant did not object to this embellishment.\n\n            This timely appeal followed.             In it, the defendant\n\ncontests only the order for restitution.\n\n            As a threshold matter, the government urges that the\n\nwaiver-of-appeal provision bars this appeal.              Although there is a\n\nclear majority view, the circuits are divided as to whether a\n\nwaiver-of-appeal provision contained in a plea agreement, which does\n\nnot specifically refer to restitution, precludes a subsequent appeal\n\nof a restitutionary order.        Compare United States v. Oladimeji, 463\n\n\n\n      1\n      The PSI Report correctly states that the total amount stolen\nduring the robbery was $944,225. However, in a later section of\nthe PSI Report, it sets the total restitution amount at $932,225,\nmistakenly giving a credit to the perpetrators of $12,000.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fF.3d 152, 157 (2d Cir. 2006) (allowing such an appeal), United\n\nStates v. Behrman, 235 F.3d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir. 2000) (same),\n\nUnited States v. Cupit, 169 F.3d 536, 539 (8th Cir. 1999) (same),\n\nand United States v. Phillips, 174 F.3d 1074, 1075 (9th Cir. 1999)\n\n(same), with United States v. Perez, 514 F.3d 296, 298 (3d Cir.\n\n2007) (barring such an appeal), and United States v. Cohen, 459 F.3d\n\n490, 497 (4th Cir. 2006) (same).      The waiver-of-appeal provision\n\nhere is silent on the possibility of restitution,2 and this court\n\nhas not opined on whether such a waiver precludes an appeal of an\n\norder for restitution.\n\n           We see no need to plunge into these murky waters today.\n\nCourts should not rush to decide unsettled issues, especially where\n\na division of authority exists.       Because this appeal is easily\n\nresolved on the merits, we have the luxury of being able to bypass\n\nthe preclusion issue today.   Thus, we assume without deciding that\n\nthe waiver-of-appeal provision does not pretermit the prosecution\n\nof this appeal.\n\n           This is the first time that the defendant has voiced an\n\nobjection to the order for restitution.   When a party has failed to\n\ninterpose a timely objection in the sentencing court, we review his\n\nensuing claim of error only for plain error.       United States v.\n\n\n\n     2\n       The defendant waived the right to appeal his sentence, but\nthe waiver provision did not specifically mention orders for\nrestitution (although restitution is a part of the sentence, see 18\nU.S.C. § 3663A(a)(1)).\n\n                                -4-\n\fDávila-González, 595 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                   To succeed under this\n\nrubric, four separate showings are required: \"(1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60.\n\n            The defendant's claim that the district court erred in\n\nordering restitution has three dimensions.                  He contends that the\n\ncourt did not adequately explain its rationale, did not apportion\n\nthe   restitutionary        amount     based   on    relative       culpability,    and\n\noverreached in directing payment \"forthwith.\"                   We approach these\n\nremonstrances mindful of the terms of the relevant statute, namely,\n\nthe Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3663A.\n\n            The MVRA requires a district court to order a defendant\n\nto make restitution to victims of certain enumerated crimes of\n\nviolence.       The offenses of conviction in this case fall squarely\n\nwithin    the    maw   of   the    statute.         See   id.   §    3663A(c)(1)(A).\n\nGenerically, then, restitution is available; and any ensuing order\n\nfor   restitution      should     be   tailored     to    require     return   of   the\n\npurloined property or its equivalent.                Id. § 3663A(b).\n\n            The first defect perceived by the defendant — the absence\n\nof a detailed explication of the court's reasoning — is not a defect\n\nat all.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          Restitution serves as a mechanism for making a victim\n\nwhole by restoring the monetary equivalent of losses suffered in\n\nconsequence of the defendant's criminal activity. See United States\n\nv. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 294 (1st Cir. 2008).            Determination of\n\nthat monetary equivalent and ordering its payment are all that the\n\nMVRA, by its terms, requires.         See 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(1)(A); see\n\nalso Innarelli, 524 F.3d at 294.             In calculating the amount, a\n\nsentencing court is not held to a standard of absolute precision.\n\nInnarelli, 524 F.3d at 294; United States v. Burdi, 414 F.3d 216,\n\n221 (1st Cir. 2005). A \"modicum of reliable evidence\" will suffice.\n\nUnited States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 587 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          To   be   sure,    the   restitutionary     amount    must   have   a\n\nrational basis in the record.      Id.      But that does not mean that the\n\ncourt must recite book and verse in making an award.\n\n          In the case at hand, simple arithmetic strips away any\n\nmystery about the origins of the amount.              There were six known\n\nparticipants in the robbery of the bank truck, and the PSI Report\n\nput the amount of the total loss at $944,225. The court ordered the\n\ndefendant to pay restitution of $157,370.83.               The inference is\n\ninescapable that the court established the restitutionary amount at\n\none-sixth of the total loss.\n\n          This brings us to the defendant's importunings about\n\nmisapportionment.     That    claim    rests    on   the   premise   that   the\n\nsentencing court, for the purpose of restitution, should have\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdivvied up the loss to reflect the relative culpability of the six\n\nparticipants in the heist.      The defendant says that he played a bit\n\npart   and,    therefore,     should    bear   a   lesser   share    of   the\n\nrestitutionary burden.\n\n              The premise on which this argument rests is patently\n\nincorrect.      A sentencing court is not required to consider an\n\nindividual's role in the offense when awarding restitution.               See\n\nUnited States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 52 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nTilcon Capaldi, Inc. v. Feldman, 249 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe court's objective should be to make the victim whole.                 See\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 53; see also 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(1)(A) (\"In each\n\norder of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each\n\nvictim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by\n\nthe court . . . .\").        Where, as here, more than one offender has\n\ncontributed to the victim's loss, \"the court may make each defendant\n\nliable for payment of the full amount of restitution.\"              18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3664(h).\n\n              Of course, a sentencing court has some discretion as to\n\nhow restitution should be apportioned among multiple defendants.\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 52.      The court may consider, among other things,\n\nthe relative culpability of those responsible for the loss.                18\n\nU.S.C. § 3664(h).     In the last analysis, however, the court is not\n\nrequired to use any particular formula for apportionment or, indeed,\n\nto apportion the loss at all.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             That ends this aspect of the matter. The method that the\n\ncourt chose to employ here — dividing the loss equally among the\n\nresponsible parties — was well within its discretion. Consequently,\n\nthe defendant's misapportionment claim fails.\n\n             The defendant's final assignment of error posits that the\n\ndistrict court overreached in ordering payment of restitution\n\n\"forthwith.\"     In this regard, he alleges that the court did not\n\nadequately consider his financial circumstances and prospects.\n\n             The MVRA requires a court, in setting out a payment\n\nschedule, to consider a defendant's financial circumstances and\n\nprospects. Id. § 3664(f)(2). But \"consideration,\" in this context,\n\ndoes not require any elaborate formality.           See United States v.\n\nTheodore, 354 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003); Vaknin, 112 F.3d at 591.\n\nIn making a restitutionary order, the court need not make explicit\n\nfindings or even indicate what it has considered; it suffices if the\n\nrecord contains relevant information about, say, the defendant's\n\nincome and assets.     See Theodore, 354 F.3d at 9; Vaknin, 112 F.3d\n\nat 591-92.     In all events, the court enjoys broad discretion in\n\nsetting a payment schedule. See United States v. Overholt, 307 F.3d\n\n1231, 1255 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n             In the instant case, the PSI Report included a detailed\n\naccount of the defendant's economic situation.             In making this\n\nappraisal,    the   probation   officer   used,   among   other   things,   a\n\nfinancial statement submitted by the defendant and an Equifax credit\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\freport.    The probation officer concluded that the defendant had\n\n$7,000 in equity in his residence, owned three automobiles with an\n\nestimated aggregate value of $42,000, and had few liabilities.                    His\n\nsole prospect for income during incarceration seemed to be the\n\nmonthly lease payments ($600) for rental of his residence.\n\n            We agree with the defendant that these figures do not\n\nshow ready access to the amount of restitution that he was ordered\n\nto pay \"forthwith.\"        But there is no reason to believe that the\n\ncourt    shirked   its    duty   to   consider      the    defendant's   financial\n\ncircumstances      and     prospects.             Moreover,     \"[a]   defendant's\n\nimpoverishment today is no assurance of future poverty, and hence,\n\npresent    impecuniousness       is   not     a    bar    to   the   imposition    of\n\nrestitution.\"      Vaknin, 112 F.3d at 592 (citing United States v.\n\nBrandon, 16 F.3d 409, 461 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            It is permissible for a sentencing court, in fashioning\n\na restitutionary order, to take into account a defendant's future\n\nearning capacity.        United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 573 (1st\n\nCir. 1993); United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 619 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    This tenet applies with particular force where, as in this\n\ncase, the proceeds of the criminal activity have been secreted by\n\n(and presumably divided among) the malefactors, and no accounting\n\nhas been made of the defendant's share. See United States v. Olson,\n\n104 F.3d 1234, 1238 (10th Cir. 1997) (holding that, for purposes of\n\nordering restitution, \"when a defendant has secreted proceeds from\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fan illegal activity, the illegal proceeds are presumed assets of the\n\ndefendant unless the defendant proves otherwise\"); United States v.\n\nVoigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1093 (3d Cir. 1996) (similar).\n\n            The short of it is that we find no abuse of discretion,\n\nlet alone any plain error, in the district court's order to pay\n\nrestitution forthwith.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the challenged order.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

However, in a later section of\nthe PSI Report, it sets the total restitution amount at $932,225,\nmistakenly giving a credit to the perpetrators of $12,000.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fF.3d 152, 157 (2d Cir. 2006) (allowing such an appeal), United\n\nStates v.

The waiver-of-appeal provision\n\nhere is silent on the possibility of restitution,2 and this court\n\nhas not opined on whether such a waiver precludes an appeal of an\n\norder for restitution.\n\n           We see no need to plunge into these murky waters today.\n\nCourts should not rush to decide unsettled issues, especially where\n\na division of authority exists.       Because this appeal is easily\n\nresolved on the merits, we have the luxury of being able to bypass\n\nthe preclusion issue today.   Thus, we assume without deciding that\n\nthe waiver-of-appeal provision does not pretermit the prosecution\n\nof this appeal.\n\n           This is the first time that the defendant has voiced an\n\nobjection to the order for restitution.   When a party has failed to\n\ninterpose a timely objection in the sentencing court, we review his\n\nensuing claim of error only for plain error.       United States v.\n\n\n\n     2\n       The defendant waived the right to appeal his sentence, but\nthe waiver provision did not specifically mention orders for\nrestitution (although restitution is a part of the sentence, see 18\nU.S.C. § 3663A(a)(1)).\n\n                                -4-\n\fDávila-González, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v.\n\nDuarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                   To succeed under this\n\nrubric, four separate showings are required: \"(1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60.\n\n            The defendant's claim that the district court erred in\n\nordering restitution has three dimensions.                  He contends that the\n\ncourt did not adequately explain its rationale, did not apportion\n\nthe   restitutionary        amount     based   on    relative       culpability,    and\n\noverreached in directing payment \"forthwith.\"                   We approach these\n\nremonstrances mindful of the terms of the relevant statute, namely,\n\nthe Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3663A.\n\n            The MVRA requires a district court to order a defendant\n\nto make restitution to victims of certain enumerated crimes of\n\nviolence.       The offenses of conviction in this case fall squarely\n\nwithin    the    maw   of   the    statute.         See   id.   §    3663A(c)(1)(A).\n\nGenerically, then, restitution is available; and any ensuing order\n\nfor   restitution      should     be   tailored     to    require     return   of   the\n\npurloined property or its equivalent.                Id. § 3663A(b).\n\n            The first defect perceived by the defendant — the absence\n\nof a detailed explication of the court's reasoning — is not a defect\n\nat all.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          Restitution serves as a mechanism for making a victim\n\nwhole by restoring the monetary equivalent of losses suffered in\n\nconsequence of the defendant's criminal activity. See United States\n\nv.

Determination of\n\nthat monetary equivalent and ordering its payment are all that the\n\nMVRA, by its terms, requires.         See 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(1)(A); see\n\nalso Innarelli, 524 F.3d at 294.             In calculating the amount, a\n\nsentencing court is not held to a standard of absolute precision.\n\nInnarelli, 524 F.3d at 294; United States v.

Id.      But that does not mean that the\n\ncourt must recite book and verse in making an award.\n\n          In the case at hand, simple arithmetic strips away any\n\nmystery about the origins of the amount.              There were six known\n\nparticipants in the robbery of the bank truck, and the PSI Report\n\nput the amount of the total loss at $944,225. The court ordered the\n\ndefendant to pay restitution of $157,370.83.               The inference is\n\ninescapable that the court established the restitutionary amount at\n\none-sixth of the total loss.\n\n          This brings us to the defendant's importunings about\n\nmisapportionment.     That    claim    rests    on   the   premise   that   the\n\nsentencing court, for the purpose of restitution, should have\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdivvied up the loss to reflect the relative culpability of the six\n\nparticipants in the heist.      The defendant says that he played a bit\n\npart   and,    therefore,     should    bear   a   lesser   share    of   the\n\nrestitutionary burden.\n\n              The premise on which this argument rests is patently\n\nincorrect.      A sentencing court is not required to consider an\n\nindividual's role in the offense when awarding restitution.               See\n\nUnited States v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nTilcon Capaldi, Inc. v.

See\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 53; see also 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(1)(A) (\"In each\n\norder of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each\n\nvictim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by\n\nthe court . . . .\").        Where, as here, more than one offender has\n\ncontributed to the victim's loss, \"the court may make each defendant\n\nliable for payment of the full amount of restitution.\"              18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3664(h).\n\n              Of course, a sentencing court has some discretion as to\n\nhow restitution should be apportioned among multiple defendants.\n\nScott, 270 F.3d at 52.      The court may consider, among other things,\n\nthe relative culpability of those responsible for the loss.                18\n\nU.S.C. § 3664(h).     In the last analysis, however, the court is not\n\nrequired to use any particular formula for apportionment or, indeed,\n\nto apportion the loss at all.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             That ends this aspect of the matter. The method that the\n\ncourt chose to employ here — dividing the loss equally among the\n\nresponsible parties — was well within its discretion. Consequently,\n\nthe defendant's misapportionment claim fails.\n\n             The defendant's final assignment of error posits that the\n\ndistrict court overreached in ordering payment of restitution\n\n\"forthwith.\"     In this regard, he alleges that the court did not\n\nadequately consider his financial circumstances and prospects.\n\n             The MVRA requires a court, in setting out a payment\n\nschedule, to consider a defendant's financial circumstances and\n\nprospects. Id. § 3664(f)(2). But \"consideration,\" in this context,\n\ndoes not require any elaborate formality.           See United States v.\n\nTheodore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200770\"><a href=\"/opinion/200770/united-states-v-theodore/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 2003); Vaknin, 112 F.3d at 591.\n\nIn making a restitutionary order, the court need not make explicit\n\nfindings or even indicate what it has considered; it suffices if the\n\nrecord contains relevant information about, say, the defendant's\n\nincome and assets.     See Theodore, 354 F.3d at 9; Vaknin, 112 F.3d\n\nat 591-92.     In all events, the court enjoys broad discretion in\n\nsetting a payment schedule. See United States v. Overholt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162640\"><a href=\"/opinion/162640/united-states-v-overholt/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n             In the instant case, the PSI Report included a detailed\n\naccount of the defendant's economic situation.             In making this\n\nappraisal,    the   probation   officer   used,   among   other   things,   a\n\nfinancial statement submitted by the defendant and an Equifax credit\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\freport.    The probation officer concluded that the defendant had\n\n$7,000 in equity in his residence, owned three automobiles with an\n\nestimated aggregate value of $42,000, and had few liabilities.                    His\n\nsole prospect for income during incarceration seemed to be the\n\nmonthly lease payments ($600) for rental of his residence.\n\n            We agree with the defendant that these figures do not\n\nshow ready access to the amount of restitution that he was ordered\n\nto pay \"forthwith.\"        But there is no reason to believe that the\n\ncourt    shirked   its    duty   to   consider      the    defendant's   financial\n\ncircumstances      and     prospects.             Moreover,     \"[a]   defendant's\n\nimpoverishment today is no assurance of future poverty, and hence,\n\npresent    impecuniousness       is   not     a    bar    to   the   imposition    of\n\nrestitution.\"      Vaknin, 112 F.3d at 592 (citing United States v.\n\nBrandon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            It is permissible for a sentencing court, in fashioning\n\na restitutionary order, to take into account a defendant's future\n\nearning capacity.
