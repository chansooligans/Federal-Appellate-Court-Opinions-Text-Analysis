George Lambert appeals a district court\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\norder dismissing his lawsuit for improper venue.  We affirm.\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          Appellant  Lambert  owns  and  operates  the  Rainbow  Fruit\n\nCompany  in Boston,  Massachusetts,  which sells  Christmas trees  and\n\nwreaths at retail during  the holiday season.  Appellees  Sam and Joan\n\nKysar operate a  Christmas tree  farm in Woodland,  Washington.   From\n\n1987 through 1989, Lambert purchased Christmas trees at wholesale from\n\nthe Kysars pursuant to a written form contract signed by both parties.\n\nThe front of the order form contained spaces in which the size, grade,\n\nquantity, and  price of each Christmas tree  order could be filled in;\n\na small space at the bottom of the page, denominated \"other\", was used\n\nby the parties  to note additional terms and conditions.   The back of\n\nthe order form stated  the fixed terms  of the contract and  provided,\n\ninter alia, that\n          \n\n          \"[t]he terms and conditions of the order documents\n          applicable to this transaction shall be interpret-\n          ed  under the case and statutory  law of the State\n          of Washington.  In the event any action is brought\n          to enforce such terms  and conditions, venue shall\n          lie exclusively in Clark County, Washington.\"\n\n          In July 1989, the Kysars visited Boston to discuss Lambert's\n\nneeds for the upcoming Christmas season.  On  their return to Washing-\n\nton, they  sent Lambert an order  form, filled out and  signed by Joan\n\n                                  3\n\nKysar.  The numbers handwritten on the form by Joan Kysar provided for\n\nan order of 2600 Christmas trees  at $11.60 apiece.  At the bottom  of\n\nthe form, in the space marked  \"other\", Kysar wrote that the order was\n\n\"[b]ased on 4 loads  of 650 trees each.  All trucks  will be loaded to\n\ncapacity.  25% deposit . . . balance due on or before 12/10/89.\"\n\n          Lambert received the order form in late July, but apparently\n\nthought that it overstated the  quantity of trees needed for the  next\n\nseason.   Writing on the same  order form submitted by  the Kysars, he\n\nchanged the notation \"4 loads of 650 trees  each,\" to read \"3 loads of\n\n550  trees\", and  changed  the total  number  ordered from  \"2600\"  to\n\n\"1650.\"  Lambert also recomputed  the total amount due and  the amount\n\nof the  required 25% deposit.   He inserted the new  figures over Joan\n\nKysar's  handwritten figures at the  bottom of the  form, and returned\n\nthe form to the Kysars.  He made no change to the $11.60 unit price or\n\nto any other contract provision.\n\n          On  August 21,  1989, in  a  letter to  Sam and  Jean Kysar,\n\nLambert enclosed a $4785 check \"for payment of the deposit on our tree\n\norder\", and stated his  understanding \"that shipping will be  the same\n\nas  last year.  There will be three loads of 1,650 trees at $11.60 for\n\na total  cost of $19,140.\"   The  record on appeal  does not  indicate\n\nwhether  the  Kysars received  Lambert's  letter,  cashed his  deposit\n\ncheck, or issued any written response, but on November 20,  25 and 29,\n\nin accordance with  the instructions  on the altered  order form,  the\n\nKysars  sent Lambert  the requested  1,650 trees,  in three  loads, by\n\noverland truck.  Following delivery of  the trees on November 25,  29,\n\n                                  4\n\nand December 1, Lambert's inspection allegedly revealed that the trees\n\n\"were dry, not fresh,  and appeared old.\" Citing the  allegedly defec-\n\ntive  condition of  the  trees, Lambert  refused  to pay  the  balance\n\nclaimed by the Kysars.\n\n          In  June,  1991, the  Kysars  filed  suit in  Clark  County,\n\nWashington, to recover the  balance claimed due.  In  September, 1991,\n\nLambert filed  the present  countersuit against  the Kysars in  Massa-\n\nchusetts  Superior Court,  alleging misrepresentation, breach  of con-\n\ntract, breach of implied warranty, and unfair business practices under\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A.  The  Kysars removed Lambert's suit to federal\n\ndistrict court and moved  to dismiss under Federal Rules  12(b)(3) and\n\n12(b)(6),  alleging improper  venue and  failure to  state a  claim on\n\nwhich relief could be granted.1  \n\n          On  November 18,  1991, the  motion to  dismiss was  granted\n\nwithout hearing,  by  margin  order:   \"[The  defendants']  motion  to\n\ndismiss is allowed.   According to the terms  of contract[,] suit must\n\nbe filed  in State Court in Washington.\"  We review the district court\n\ndismissal order de  novo.  See Edwards v. John  Hancock Mut. Life Ins.\n                                                                      \n\nCo., 973 F.2d  1027, 1028  (1st Cir. 1992);  see also  Instrumentation\n                                                                      \n\nAssocs., Inc. v.

We have\nheld  that such  dismissals  are founded  on  Rule 12(b)(6),  see  LFC\n                                                                      \nLessors, Inc. v.

No matter, however, since \"we are not  bound by the label\nemployed below,  and we  agree  that the  case should  have been  dis-\nmissed.\"   See id.  (quoting Carr v.

Lambert vigorously disagrees.  According to Lambert,\n\nthe  changes he made  to the quantity  term on the  Kysars' order form\n\namounted to a material  alteration (and therefore a rejection)  of the\n\nKysar offer, paving  the way for  a counteroffer in  the form of  Lam-\n\nbert's August 21 letter.  Since the August 21 letter contained neither\n\na  forum  selection clause  nor  an  express choice-of-law  provision,\n\nLambert  asserts that venue and  choice-of-law rules are  to be deter-\n\nmined under general common-law and  statutory principles.  In particu-\n\nlar, Lambert asserts, the Massachusetts venue remains proper under the\n\n                                  6\n\ngeneral  rules applicable to removed cases in federal courts, i.e., 28\n                                                                  \n\nU.S.C.   1441.2\n\n          We agree with  the first  part of Lambert's  argument.   The\n\nchanges  Lambert made  to the  quantity term  amounted to  a rejection\n\n                    \n\n2Lambert's opposition to the  Kysars' motion to dismiss also  seems to\nassert:   (1) that  the Kysars  waived their  right to  plead improper\nvenue by filing the removal petition, thereby implicitly acknowledging\nthe district court's authority to hear  the case; and (2) that even if\nthe removal petition did not constitute a per se waiver of their right\n                                                \nto plead  improper venue,  in the present  case waiver can  be implied\nfrom  the representation made in the removal petition that \"[v]enue in\n[Massachusetts federal]  Court [was]  proper under 28  U.S.C.   1391.\"\nNeither assertion is sound.  Although it is axiomatic that a defendant\nmust  mount any challenge to venue at the earliest possible opportuni-\nty, see Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Corp. v. New England Terminal Co., 125 F.2d\n                                                            \n71,  74 (1st Cir. 1942), the Kysars  properly preserved their right to\nchallenge venue by  raising it in the state court  action and renewing\nit in their first pleading following removal.  It is well settled that\nthe filing of a removal petition in a diversity action,  without more,\ndoes not waive the right to object in federal court to the state court\nvenue.  In order to obtain the benefits of a federal forum in diversi-\nty cases, \"[the] removal must be 'into the district where such suit is\n                                \npending'[;  n]o  choice is  possible and  for  that reason  nothing in\nrespect to venue can be waived.\"  Moss  v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,\n                                                                     \n157 F.2d  1005  (2d Cir.  1946),  cert. denied,  330  U.S. 839  (1947)\n                                              \n(emphasis added).\n     This analysis is not  altered by the Kysars' assertion,  in their\nremoval petition,  that venue in Massachusetts  federal district court\nwas proper under 28  U.S.C.   1391.  Even if  their assertion could be\nconstrued as  a waiver of  any objection  to venue under  28 U.S.C.   \n1391,  the venue of a removed action is not governed by   1391, but by\n28 U.S.C.   1441(a).   Indeed, removal of an action  to a proper forum\nunder   1441(a) frequently has been considered a waiver or cure of any\ndefect  in the original venue of the  removed action under 28 U.S.C.  \n1391.   See  Polizzi  v. Cowles  Magazines,  Inc., 345  U.S. 663,  665\n                                                 \n(1953);  Seaboard Rice Milling  Co. v. Chicago,  R.I. &amp; P.R.

Here, of  course, a differ-\n                   \nent  issue is presented, since a valid forum selection clause operates\nto  render the venue improper,  not only under    1391, but also under\n                                                                \n  1441(a).\n\n                                  7\n\nunder  Article 2  of  the Uniform  Commercial  Code, and  the  Kysars'\n\nperformance of  the new contract amounted to  an acceptance of the new\n\nterms  proposed by  Lambert.   We  disagree with  the  second part  of\n\nLambert's argument, however.  Lambert's counteroffer was made in July,\n\nwhen  he amended the order form containing the Kysars' original offer,\n\nnot  in Lambert's  August  21 letter.   Accordingly,  the counteroffer\n   \n\nincorporated  the  unamended terms  and  conditions  contained in  the\n\noriginal offer, including its venue and choice-of-law  clauses.  Since\n\nthe venue  clause      impliedly  mandating a  Washington forum     is\n\nenforceable  under  both state  and federal  common law,  the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed the action.\n\nA.   The Contract\n                 \n\n          The parties disagree on  whether a Massachusetts court would\n\napply Massachusetts  or  Washington  law  to the  formation  of  their\n\ncontract.   See Klaxon v. Stentor Elec.  Mfg.

The  Kysars reside  and\n\noperate their business in  Washington.  Their interest in  selecting a\n\nforum     the consolidation  of litigation involving  far-flung opera-\n\ntions    was  eminently reasonable.   The contract  in litigation  has\n\nstrong links to  Washington, where  it was accepted  and largely  per-\n\nformed.  Moreover, Washington is no more \"remote\" from Lambert's place\n\nof  business than  when  he executed  the  order form,  either  on the\n\noccasion of  the present agreement  or prior agreements  between these\n\nparties.   The  forum  selection clause  was  printed clearly  on  the\n\nreverse side  of the form, in plain language, and the contract was not\n\nso long as to make it difficult or impossible to read.

Appellees  Sam and Joan\n\nKysar operate a  Christmas tree  farm in Woodland,  Washington.   From\n\n1987 through 1989, Lambert purchased Christmas trees at wholesale from\n\nthe Kysars pursuant to a written form contract signed by both parties.\n\nThe front of the order form contained spaces in which the size, grade,\n\nquantity, and  price of each Christmas tree  order could be filled in;\n\na small space at the bottom of the page, denominated \"other\", was used\n\nby the parties  to note additional terms and conditions.   The back of\n\nthe order form stated  the fixed terms  of the contract and  provided,\n\ninter alia, that\n          \n\n          \"[t]he terms and conditions of the order documents\n          applicable to this transaction shall be interpret-\n          ed  under the case and statutory  law of the State\n          of Washington.  In the event any action is brought\n          to enforce such terms  and conditions, venue shall\n          lie exclusively in Clark County, Washington.\"\n\n          In July 1989, the Kysars visited Boston to discuss Lambert's\n\nneeds for the upcoming Christmas season.  On  their return to Washing-\n\nton, they  sent Lambert an order  form, filled out and  signed by Joan\n\n                                  3\n\nKysar.  The numbers handwritten on the form by Joan Kysar provided for\n\nan order of 2600 Christmas trees  at $11.60 apiece.  At the bottom  of\n\nthe form, in the space marked  \"other\", Kysar wrote that the order was\n\n\"[b]ased on 4 loads  of 650 trees each.  All trucks  will be loaded to\n\ncapacity.  25% deposit . . . balance due on or before 12/10/89.\"\n\n          Lambert received the order form in late July, but apparently\n\nthought that it overstated the  quantity of trees needed for the  next\n\nseason.   Writing on the same  order form submitted by  the Kysars, he\n\nchanged the notation \"4 loads of 650 trees  each,\" to read \"3 loads of\n\n550  trees\", and  changed  the total  number  ordered from  \"2600\"  to\n\n\"1650.\"  Lambert also recomputed  the total amount due and  the amount\n\nof the  required 25% deposit.   He inserted the new  figures over Joan\n\nKysar's  handwritten figures at the  bottom of the  form, and returned\n\nthe form to the Kysars.  He made no change to the $11.60 unit price or\n\nto any other contract provision.\n\n          On  August 21,  1989, in  a  letter to  Sam and  Jean Kysar,\n\nLambert enclosed a $4785 check \"for payment of the deposit on our tree\n\norder\", and stated his  understanding \"that shipping will be  the same\n\nas  last year.  There will be three loads of 1,650 trees at $11.60 for\n\na total  cost of $19,140.\"   The  record on appeal  does not  indicate\n\nwhether  the  Kysars received  Lambert's  letter,  cashed his  deposit\n\ncheck, or issued any written response, but on November 20,  25 and 29,\n\nin accordance with  the instructions  on the altered  order form,  the\n\nKysars  sent Lambert  the requested  1,650 trees,  in three  loads, by\n\noverland truck.  Following delivery of  the trees on November 25,  29,\n\n                                  4\n\nand December 1, Lambert's inspection allegedly revealed that the trees\n\n\"were dry, not fresh,  and appeared old.\" Citing the  allegedly defec-\n\ntive  condition of  the  trees, Lambert  refused  to pay  the  balance\n\nclaimed by the Kysars.\n\n          In  June,  1991, the  Kysars  filed  suit in  Clark  County,\n\nWashington, to recover the  balance claimed due.  In  September, 1991,\n\nLambert filed  the present  countersuit against  the Kysars in  Massa-\n\nchusetts  Superior Court,  alleging misrepresentation, breach  of con-\n\ntract, breach of implied warranty, and unfair business practices under\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A.  The  Kysars removed Lambert's suit to federal\n\ndistrict court and moved  to dismiss under Federal Rules  12(b)(3) and\n\n12(b)(6),  alleging improper  venue and  failure to  state a  claim on\n\nwhich relief could be granted.1  \n\n          On  November 18,  1991, the  motion to  dismiss was  granted\n\nwithout hearing,  by  margin  order:   \"[The  defendants']  motion  to\n\ndismiss is allowed.

Lambert vigorously disagrees.  According to Lambert,\n\nthe  changes he made  to the quantity  term on the  Kysars' order form\n\namounted to a material  alteration (and therefore a rejection)  of the\n\nKysar offer, paving  the way for  a counteroffer in  the form of  Lam-\n\nbert's August 21 letter.  Since the August 21 letter contained neither\n\na  forum  selection clause  nor  an  express choice-of-law  provision,\n\nLambert  asserts that venue and  choice-of-law rules are  to be deter-\n\nmined under general common-law and  statutory principles.  In particu-\n\nlar, Lambert asserts, the Massachusetts venue remains proper under the\n\n                                  6\n\ngeneral  rules applicable to removed cases in federal courts, i.e., 28\n                                                                  \n\nU.S.C.   1441.2\n\n          We agree with  the first  part of Lambert's  argument.   The\n\nchanges  Lambert made  to the  quantity term  amounted to  a rejection\n\n                    \n\n2Lambert's opposition to the  Kysars' motion to dismiss also  seems to\nassert:   (1) that  the Kysars  waived their  right to  plead improper\nvenue by filing the removal petition, thereby implicitly acknowledging\nthe district court's authority to hear  the case; and (2) that even if\nthe removal petition did not constitute a per se waiver of their right\n                                                \nto plead  improper venue,  in the present  case waiver can  be implied\nfrom  the representation made in the removal petition that \"[v]enue in\n[Massachusetts federal]  Court [was]  proper under 28  U.S.C.   1391.\"\nNeither assertion is sound.

Even if  their assertion could be\nconstrued as  a waiver of  any objection  to venue under  28 U.S.C.   \n1391,  the venue of a removed action is not governed by   1391, but by\n28 U.S.C.   1441(a).

Rather, it means that [a] . . .\n          forum-selection clause  in a  contract is  not en-\n          forceable if  the inclusion of that  clause in the\n                                                            \n          contract was the product of fraud or coercion.\n                  \n\nId.  at 519 n.14 (emphasis in original); see also Gruson, Forum-Selec-\n                                                                      \n\ntion Clauses,  1982 U. Ill.  L. Rev. at  165 (\"a  party should not  be\n            \n\npermitted  to escape a forum-selection provision by merely calling the\n\nvalidity of the entire contract into question\").\n\n          The better general rule,  we think, is that contract-related\n\ntort claims involving the same operative facts as a parallel claim for\n\nbreach  of  contract should  be  heard in  the forum  selected  by the\n\ncontracting parties.
