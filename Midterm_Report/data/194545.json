This  appeal is from  a judgment of  the\n               \n\ndistrict court affirming a final decision of the Secretary of\n\nHealth and  Human Services (\"Secretary\")  that appellant  did\n\nnot meet  the disability requirements of  the Social Security\n\nAct.\n\n     Appellant's application for disability  benefits alleged\n\nan  inability to  work  beginning  May  16,  1988  due  to  a\n\ncombination  of  chest  pain  and  mental  disability.    Her\n\napplication was initially denied, appealed and  denied again.\n\nA de novo hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge\n         \n\n[\"ALJ\"] on  July 10, 1990.   On July 30, 1990,  the ALJ found\n\nthat appellant had a residual functional capacity for certain\n\nunskilled light work jobs  which exist in significant numbers\n\nin the economy, and so was  not under a disability as defined\n\nin  the Act.  The Appeals  Council denied appellant's request\n\nfor review.   On appeal to the  district court, the  case was\n\nassigned to a magistrate-judge who found that the Secretary's\n\ndecision  was based  on substantial evidence  and recommended\n\naffirmance.    The  district court  adopted  the magistrate's\n\nreport and recommendation, affirming the Secretary's decision\n\non May 11, 1992.  We affirm.      Appellant was  45 years old\n\nat the time of the hearing.  She had completed the third year\n\nof high school.  Her  immediate past relevant work experience\n\nwas  as  a welder/solderer  in  the  electronics industry,  a\n\n                             -2-\n\nposition she had held for ten years prior to the onset of her\n\nillness.  \n\n     Appellant was diagnosed as suffering from chest pain and\n\nmoderate to severe depression.  To qualify for benefits under\n\nthe  Act, appellant bore the burden of proving that by reason\n\nof  one, or  a combination  of these  conditions, she  had an\n\n\"inability to engage in  any substantial gainful activity due\n\nto ... impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death\n\nor  last for a  continuous period of not  less than 12 months\n\n....  \" 42 U.S.C.    423(d)(1)(A); 42 U.S.C.    416(i)(1); 20\n\nC.F.R.     404.1505; Bowen  v.  Yuckert,  482  U.S. 137,  140\n                                       \n\n(1987); McDonald v. Secretary of HHS, 795 F.2d 1118 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1986).\n\n     The ALJ considered appellant's testimony,  the testimony\n\nof  a  vocational  expert  (\"VE\"),  and  appellant's  medical\n\nrecords.   Using the  five-step sequential evaluation  of the\n\nevidence required  by 20  C.F.R.    404.1520,  404.1520a, the\n\nALJ found  that appellant's  impairments were severe  but did\n\nnot, alone or in combination, equal the severity level of any\n\nlisted  impairment.  20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart. P, Appendix\n\n1.  Appellant's chest pain, however, was found to prevent her\n\nfrom returning to her past relevant work.  \n\n     Appellant  does not  dispute  the above  findings.   She\n\ntakes issue,  however, with the  ALJ'S finding at  step five,\n\nthat  despite  her  combination  of  conditions,  she  has  a\n\n                             -3-\n\nresidual  functional  capacity to  engage in  unskilled light\n\nwork jobs which allow for alternating physical positions. See\n                                                             \n\n20  C.F.R.   404.1545.  Appellant's objection is not based on\n\nthe  existence  or  numbers  of  such  jobs  in  the national\n\neconomy, only  the extent  to which  the evidence  supports a\n\nfinding that she  is capable  of performing such  work.   The\n\nSecretary bore the burden of proof on this issue.  20  C.F.R.\n\n  404.1520(f)(1); Rosado v. Secretary  of HHS, 807 F.2d  292,\n                                             \n\n294 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n     Our  standard  of  review  is  whether  the  Secretary's\n\nfindings are supported  by \"substantial evidence.\"   Although\n\nthe record may arguably support  more than one conclusion, we\n\nmust uphold  the Secretary, \"if a  reasonable mind, reviewing\n\nthe evidence  in the record  as a  whole, could accept  it as\n\nadequate  to support his conclusion.\"   Ortiz v.

Where  the  facts  permit  diverse\n\ninferences,  we will  affirm  the Secretary  so  long as  the\n\ninferences drawn  are supported  by the evidence.

Secretary of HHS,  819 F.2d  1, 3 (1st  Cir. 1987),\n                          \n\n                             -4-\n\ncert. denied, 484 U.S.  1012 (1988); Lizotte v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHHS, 654 F.2d 127, 128 (1st Cir. 1981).\n   \n\n     There  was  ample  medical  evidence in  the  record  to\n\nsupport the ALJ's  conclusion regarding appellant's  physical\n\ncapacities.  Appellant's chest pain was not attributed to any\n\nmajor cardiac  impairment, hypertension or end  organ damage,\n\nbut  it  did  require  her  to  avoid  strenuous  activities.\n\nObjective medical reports described  her pain as episodic and\n\ncontrolled by  small doses  of medication.   After evaluating\n\nappellant's  subjective complaints  of pain  in light  of the\n\nfactors set forth  in Avery v. Secretary of HHS,  797 F.2d 19\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.  1986), the ALJ  fairly concluded that  despite her\n\nchest  condition,  appellant  is physically  capable  of  the\n\nexertions required  by light and  sedentary work, so  long as\n\nshe is permitted to alternate positions occasionally.  \n\n      There  was also sufficient  evidence that  despite some\n\nmental impairment attributable to major depression, appellant\n\nretained the mental capacity to perform unskilled jobs in the\n\nlight  and sedentary  work categories.   The  medical records\n\nshowed that  appellant has been treated  with medications, on\n\nan out-patient basis, at the Coamo Mental Health Center since\n\nNovember,  1988.   Reports  from  Dr.  Vivian R.  Bonilla,  a\n\npsychiatrist  who saw appellant  on two  occasions, described\n\nher as  alert, oriented, coherent,  spontaneous, logical  and\n\ngoal  directed in  her responses.   Both  Dr. Bonilla,  and a\n\n                             -5-\n\nconsulting psychiatrist, Dr. Hector Luis  Rodriguez, found no\n\nsignificant limitations  on  appellant's memory,  ability  to\n\nunderstand and  carry out short and  simple instructions, ask\n\nsimple   questions,  set   realistic   goals,   and   respond\n\nappropriately to changes  in the work setting.   In addition,\n\ntwo state agency physicians, on review of appellant's medical\n\nrecords,   concluded  that   she  could   carry  out   simple\n\ninstructions,   maintain  a   normal  workweek,   respond  to\n\nsupervisors and co-workers and interact with the public.     \n\n     The VE  opined, in answer to  a hypothetical summarizing\n\nthe  above evidence, that  appellant could not  return to her\n\nprior  job  of  welder  because  the  job's  high  production\n\nrequirements did not permit  appellant to alternate positions\n\nwith  the frequency  required.   However,  the VE  identified\n\nseveral   unskilled   light  work   jobs  which   allow  this\n\nflexibility, and  which  can  be performed  by  a  person  of\n\nappellant's age, education and work experience suffering from\n\nmoderate mental limitations.  The VE's answer assumed limited\n\nabilities  to understand, remember, concentrate, interact and\n\nwork  near others, accept instruction, be punctual, etc.  The\n\njobs he  identified included hand classifier,  garment folder\n\nand hand trimmer.\n\n     Appellant contends that the ALJ  erred in relying on the\n\nVE's testimony described above.  Instead, appellant says, the\n\nALJ should have based  his decision on the VE's  later answer\n\n                             -6-\n\nto a hypothetical posed by appellant's attorney.  Appellant's\n\nhypothetical asked the VE whether appellant could perform the\n\nidentified jobs if the VE \"gave credibility to the content of\n\nExhibit 21 and  the residuals accompanying  it.\"  Exhibit  21\n\nappears to have been a copy of Dr. Bonilla's \"Mental Residual\n\nFunctional Capacity Assessment.\"  The VE's answer was  in the\n\nnegative. \n\n     Appellant argues that the ALJ was required to accept the\n\nVE's response to the latter question as \"controlling\" because\n\nit  was based  on  the opinion  of  a doctor  described  as a\n\n\"treating\"  psychiatrist.    This  argument  is  an  apparent\n\nreference to  a recently promulgated regulation,  20 C.F.R.  \n\n404.1527  (1991), which  describes  the manner  in which  the\n\nSecretary weighs  medical evidence  of disability.   One part\n\nprovides:\n\n     Generally we give more weight to opinions from your\n     treating sources ....   If we find  that a treating\n     source's opinion on the  issue(s) of the nature and\n     severity of  your impairments is well  supported by\n     medically   acceptable   clinical  and   laboratory\n     diagnostic techniques and is not  inconsistent with\n     other substantial  evidence in your case record, we\n     will give  it controlling weight.   When we  do not\n     give ...  controlling weight, we will  apply [other\n     factors] in  determining [its] weight ...   We will\n     always give  good reasons  in our ...  decision for\n     the weight we give your treating source's opinion.\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.1527(d)(2).\n\n     The  regulation  is  thus   neither  as  delimiting  nor\n\ninflexible  as appellant's  argument suggests.   It  does not\n\nmandate assignment  of some unvarying weight  to every report\n\n                             -7-\n\nin every case.  The ALJ is not required automatically to give\n                              \n\ncontrolling   weight  to  any   \"treating\"  doctor's  report,\n                             \n\ndenominated as such.  In  some cases \"controlling weight\" may\n\nbe assigned if the report meets the specified qualifications,\n              \n\nand is not inconsistent with  other substantial evidence.  In\n\nother  cases, the  weight  of a  treating source's  report is\n\nfurther evaluated  in light  of the many  factors articulated\n\nthroughout  the remainder  of  the rule.    See 20  C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n404.1527(d)(1)-(6).    And  in  any  event, the  \"controlling\n\nweight\" language  is relevant only to  those medical opinions\n\nwhich the regulations elsewhere  define as originating from a\n\n\"treating\"  source.   That  term, too,  is  not static.    As\n\ndefined in 20  C.F.R.    404.1502, and further  refined in   \n\n404.1527(d)(2)(i)(ii),   it   refers   to   a   physician  or\n\npsychologist  with  whom   the  applicant  has  an   \"ongoing\n\ntreatment relationship,\" as determined by the type, frequency\n\nand  quality  of  doctor-patient  contact  in  light  of  its\n\nconsistency with accepted medical practice for the particular\n\ncondition.  In all  cases, the responsibility for determining\n\nwhether the  statutory definition of disability  has been met\n\nis reserved to the Secretary.  20 C.F.R.   404.1527(e).\n\n      We  need not  reach the  Secretary's argument  that Dr.\n\nBonilla  is  not  properly  defined as  a  \"treating\"  doctor\n\nbecause  we think  that appellant  exaggerates the  record in\n\nreaching an issue under this regulation.   We do not read the\n\n                             -8-\n\nALJ's  decision as  rejecting Dr.  Bonilla's opinion,  nor as\n\naccording its  relevant portions  any less than  full weight.\n\nSince Dr. Bonilla's opinion was,  for the most part, entirely\n\nconsistent with the other medical evidence, and was among the\n\nopinions  cited  by the  ALJ  as  cumulatively informing  his\n\ndecision, there  was no occasion redundantly  to describe the\n\nweight  assigned to  this part  of Dr.  Bonilla's  opinion as\n\n\"controlling,\" or otherwise.\n\n      Moreover,  as   to  the  \"Mental   Residual  Functional\n\nCapacity  Assessment,\"  it appears  to us  that what  the ALJ\n\nrejected was not  Dr. Bonilla's conclusions,  but appellant's\n\ninterpretation of both the assessment  and the VE's answer to\n\nappellant's hypothetical.   The  VE's response  was ambiguous\n\ndue  to the question posed.  The hypothetical did not specify\n\nfacts, but  simply asked  the  VE to  assume as  a basis  the\n\nentire, multi-faceted,  three-page exhibit.   It is  thus not\n\nclear how the expert understood the question, or which of its\n\nmultiple facts he  was relying upon in his  answer.  The VE's\n\nanswer  mentioned  the \"physical  demands\" of  a job,  a term\n\nwhich does not even  appear in the exhibit.   And appellant's\n\nfollow-up   question,  which   included,  as   an  additional\n\npredicate,   appellant's   subjective  complaints   of  pain,\n\nheadaches,  and  the  like,  did  not  help  to  clarify  any\n\nobjective basis for the first answer.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     The   ALJ  interpreted   Dr.  Bonilla's   assessment  as\n\nreflecting  that  appellant  suffered  only  insignificant or\n\nmoderate degree limitations in the mental abilities  required\n\nfor the simple  tasks in the  unskilled job category.   It is\n\ntrue  the  assessment  also recited  some  \"markedly\" limited\n\nabilities,  including the  ability to  sustain attention  and\n\nconcentration for extended periods  and \"to complete a normal\n\nworkday ... without interruptions from  psychologically based\n\nsymptoms.\"   But  the ALJ  determined that  these limitations\n\nwere  of   primary  relevance  to   skilled  or  semi-skilled\n\npositions,  not  unskilled jobs  with  only light  production\n\ndemands.  This  conclusion was supported by  the VE's earlier\n\ntestimony  as  to the  mental  skills needed  in  the various\n\ncategories. \n\n    As we read  the ALJ's  decision, then, it  was a  logical\n\nmatching of Dr. Bonilla's medical conclusions with the expert\n\nevidence relating to the job market.   The ALJ did not reject\n\nany of the doctor's  medical conclusions nor assign them  any\n\nlesser weight.   His interpretation of  Dr. Bonilla's opinion\n\nwas  well  supported by  the  other  assessments and  medical\n\nevidence in  the record, including Dr.  Bonilla's own written\n\nreport  of  her  examination  of  appellant.    And  we note,\n\nparenthetically, that had the ALJ instead adopted appellant's\n\ninterpretation,   reading   Dr.   Bonilla's   assessment   as\n\ninconsistent with the  other substantial medical  evidence in\n\n                             -10-\n\nthe  record, the  regulation  cited would  not, as  appellant\n\nargues,   have  required  the   assignment  of  \"controlling\"\n\nweight.1  \n\n      For the reasons stated, the decision below is affirmed.\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  Although 20  C.F.R.   404.1527, was  promulgated in final\nform  on August  1,  1991, while  this  case was  pending  on\nappeal, the  Secretary has not objected  to the applicability\nof the  regulation's approach in this case.   In light of our\nconclusions and the  lack of  objection, we have  no need  to\nconsider any questions of retroactivity. \n\n                             -11-\n",

This  appeal is from  a judgment of  the\n               \n\ndistrict court affirming a final decision of the Secretary of\n\nHealth and  Human Services (\"Secretary\")  that appellant  did\n\nnot meet  the disability requirements of  the Social Security\n\nAct.\n\n     Appellant's application for disability  benefits alleged\n\nan  inability to  work  beginning  May  16,  1988  due  to  a\n\ncombination  of  chest  pain  and  mental  disability.    Her\n\napplication was initially denied, appealed and  denied again.\n\nA de novo hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge\n         \n\n[\"ALJ\"] on  July 10, 1990.   On July 30, 1990,  the ALJ found\n\nthat appellant had a residual functional capacity for certain\n\nunskilled light work jobs  which exist in significant numbers\n\nin the economy, and so was  not under a disability as defined\n\nin  the Act.  The Appeals  Council denied appellant's request\n\nfor review.   On appeal to the  district court, the  case was\n\nassigned to a magistrate-judge who found that the Secretary's\n\ndecision  was based  on substantial evidence  and recommended\n\naffirmance.    The  district court  adopted  the magistrate's\n\nreport and recommendation, affirming the Secretary's decision\n\non May 11, 1992.  We affirm.      Appellant was  45 years old\n\nat the time of the hearing.  She had completed the third year\n\nof high school.  Her  immediate past relevant work experience\n\nwas  as  a welder/solderer  in  the  electronics industry,  a\n\n                             -2-\n\nposition she had held for ten years prior to the onset of her\n\nillness.  \n\n     Appellant was diagnosed as suffering from chest pain and\n\nmoderate to severe depression.  To qualify for benefits under\n\nthe  Act, appellant bore the burden of proving that by reason\n\nof  one, or  a combination  of these  conditions, she  had an\n\n\"inability to engage in  any substantial gainful activity due\n\nto ... impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death\n\nor  last for a  continuous period of not  less than 12 months\n\n....  \" 42 U.S.C.    423(d)(1)(A); 42 U.S.C.    416(i)(1); 20\n\nC.F.R.     404.1505; Bowen  v.

Using the  five-step sequential evaluation  of the\n\nevidence required  by 20  C.F.R.    404.1520,  404.1520a, the\n\nALJ found  that appellant's  impairments were severe  but did\n\nnot, alone or in combination, equal the severity level of any\n\nlisted  impairment.  20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart. P, Appendix\n\n1.  Appellant's chest pain, however, was found to prevent her\n\nfrom returning to her past relevant work.  \n\n     Appellant  does not  dispute  the above  findings.   She\n\ntakes issue,  however, with the  ALJ'S finding at  step five,\n\nthat  despite  her  combination  of  conditions,  she  has  a\n\n                             -3-\n\nresidual  functional  capacity to  engage in  unskilled light\n\nwork jobs which allow for alternating physical positions.

The  medical records\n\nshowed that  appellant has been treated  with medications, on\n\nan out-patient basis, at the Coamo Mental Health Center since\n\nNovember,  1988.   Reports  from  Dr.  Vivian R.  Bonilla,  a\n\npsychiatrist  who saw appellant  on two  occasions, described\n\nher as  alert, oriented, coherent,  spontaneous, logical  and\n\ngoal  directed in  her responses.   Both  Dr. Bonilla,  and a\n\n                             -5-\n\nconsulting psychiatrist, Dr. Hector Luis  Rodriguez, found no\n\nsignificant limitations  on  appellant's memory,  ability  to\n\nunderstand and  carry out short and  simple instructions, ask\n\nsimple   questions,  set   realistic   goals,   and   respond\n\nappropriately to changes  in the work setting.   In addition,\n\ntwo state agency physicians, on review of appellant's medical\n\nrecords,   concluded  that   she  could   carry  out   simple\n\ninstructions,   maintain  a   normal  workweek,   respond  to\n\nsupervisors and co-workers and interact with the public.     \n\n     The VE  opined, in answer to  a hypothetical summarizing\n\nthe  above evidence, that  appellant could not  return to her\n\nprior  job  of  welder  because  the  job's  high  production\n\nrequirements did not permit  appellant to alternate positions\n\nwith  the frequency  required.   However,  the VE  identified\n\nseveral   unskilled   light  work   jobs  which   allow  this\n\nflexibility, and  which  can  be performed  by  a  person  of\n\nappellant's age, education and work experience suffering from\n\nmoderate mental limitations.  The VE's answer assumed limited\n\nabilities  to understand, remember, concentrate, interact and\n\nwork  near others, accept instruction, be punctual, etc.  The\n\njobs he  identified included hand classifier,  garment folder\n\nand hand trimmer.\n\n     Appellant contends that the ALJ  erred in relying on the\n\nVE's testimony described above.  Instead, appellant says, the\n\nALJ should have based  his decision on the VE's  later answer\n\n                             -6-\n\nto a hypothetical posed by appellant's attorney.  Appellant's\n\nhypothetical asked the VE whether appellant could perform the\n\nidentified jobs if the VE \"gave credibility to the content of\n\nExhibit 21 and  the residuals accompanying  it.\"  Exhibit  21\n\nappears to have been a copy of Dr. Bonilla's \"Mental Residual\n\nFunctional Capacity Assessment.\"  The VE's answer was  in the\n\nnegative. \n\n     Appellant argues that the ALJ was required to accept the\n\nVE's response to the latter question as \"controlling\" because\n\nit  was based  on  the opinion  of  a doctor  described  as a\n\n\"treating\"  psychiatrist.    This  argument  is  an  apparent\n\nreference to  a recently promulgated regulation,  20 C.F.R.  \n\n404.1527  (1991), which  describes  the manner  in which  the\n\nSecretary weighs  medical evidence  of disability.   One part\n\nprovides:\n\n     Generally we give more weight to opinions from your\n     treating sources ....   If we find  that a treating\n     source's opinion on the  issue(s) of the nature and\n     severity of  your impairments is well  supported by\n     medically   acceptable   clinical  and   laboratory\n     diagnostic techniques and is not  inconsistent with\n     other substantial  evidence in your case record, we\n     will give  it controlling weight.   When we  do not\n     give ...  controlling weight, we will  apply [other\n     factors] in  determining [its] weight ...   We will\n     always give  good reasons  in our ...  decision for\n     the weight we give your treating source's opinion.\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.1527(d)(2).\n\n     The  regulation  is  thus   neither  as  delimiting  nor\n\ninflexible  as appellant's  argument suggests.   It  does not\n\nmandate assignment  of some unvarying weight  to every report\n\n                             -7-\n\nin every case.  The ALJ is not required automatically to give\n                              \n\ncontrolling   weight  to  any   \"treating\"  doctor's  report,\n                             \n\ndenominated as such.  In  some cases \"controlling weight\" may\n\nbe assigned if the report meets the specified qualifications,\n              \n\nand is not inconsistent with  other substantial evidence.  In\n\nother  cases, the  weight  of a  treating source's  report is\n\nfurther evaluated  in light  of the many  factors articulated\n\nthroughout  the remainder  of  the rule.    See 20  C.F.R.   \n                                               \n\n404.1527(d)(1)-(6).    And  in  any  event, the  \"controlling\n\nweight\" language  is relevant only to  those medical opinions\n\nwhich the regulations elsewhere  define as originating from a\n\n\"treating\"  source.   That  term, too,  is  not static.    As\n\ndefined in 20  C.F.R.    404.1502, and further  refined in   \n\n404.1527(d)(2)(i)(ii),   it   refers   to   a   physician  or\n\npsychologist  with  whom   the  applicant  has  an   \"ongoing\n\ntreatment relationship,\" as determined by the type, frequency\n\nand  quality  of  doctor-patient  contact  in  light  of  its\n\nconsistency with accepted medical practice for the particular\n\ncondition.  In all  cases, the responsibility for determining\n\nwhether the  statutory definition of disability  has been met\n\nis reserved to the Secretary.  20 C.F.R.   404.1527(e).\n\n      We  need not  reach the  Secretary's argument  that Dr.\n\nBonilla  is  not  properly  defined as  a  \"treating\"  doctor\n\nbecause  we think  that appellant  exaggerates the  record in\n\nreaching an issue under this regulation.   We do not read the\n\n                             -8-\n\nALJ's  decision as  rejecting Dr.  Bonilla's opinion,  nor as\n\naccording its  relevant portions  any less than  full weight.\n\nSince Dr. Bonilla's opinion was,  for the most part, entirely\n\nconsistent with the other medical evidence, and was among the\n\nopinions  cited  by the  ALJ  as  cumulatively informing  his\n\ndecision, there  was no occasion redundantly  to describe the\n\nweight  assigned to  this part  of Dr.  Bonilla's  opinion as\n\n\"controlling,\" or otherwise.\n\n      Moreover,  as   to  the  \"Mental   Residual  Functional\n\nCapacity  Assessment,\"  it appears  to us  that what  the ALJ\n\nrejected was not  Dr. Bonilla's conclusions,  but appellant's\n\ninterpretation of both the assessment  and the VE's answer to\n\nappellant's hypothetical.   The  VE's response  was ambiguous\n\ndue  to the question posed.  The hypothetical did not specify\n\nfacts, but  simply asked  the  VE to  assume as  a basis  the\n\nentire, multi-faceted,  three-page exhibit.   It is  thus not\n\nclear how the expert understood the question, or which of its\n\nmultiple facts he  was relying upon in his  answer.  The VE's\n\nanswer  mentioned  the \"physical  demands\" of  a job,  a term\n\nwhich does not even  appear in the exhibit.   And appellant's\n\nfollow-up   question,  which   included,  as   an  additional\n\npredicate,   appellant's   subjective  complaints   of  pain,\n\nheadaches,  and  the  like,  did  not  help  to  clarify  any\n\nobjective basis for the first answer.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     The   ALJ  interpreted   Dr.  Bonilla's   assessment  as\n\nreflecting  that  appellant  suffered  only  insignificant or\n\nmoderate degree limitations in the mental abilities  required\n\nfor the simple  tasks in the  unskilled job category.   It is\n\ntrue  the  assessment  also recited  some  \"markedly\" limited\n\nabilities,  including the  ability to  sustain attention  and\n\nconcentration for extended periods  and \"to complete a normal\n\nworkday ... without interruptions from  psychologically based\n\nsymptoms.\"   But  the ALJ  determined that  these limitations\n\nwere  of   primary  relevance  to   skilled  or  semi-skilled\n\npositions,  not  unskilled jobs  with  only light  production\n\ndemands.  This  conclusion was supported by  the VE's earlier\n\ntestimony  as  to the  mental  skills needed  in  the various\n\ncategories. \n\n    As we read  the ALJ's  decision, then, it  was a  logical\n\nmatching of Dr. Bonilla's medical conclusions with the expert\n\nevidence relating to the job market.   The ALJ did not reject\n\nany of the doctor's  medical conclusions nor assign them  any\n\nlesser weight.   His interpretation of  Dr. Bonilla's opinion\n\nwas  well  supported by  the  other  assessments and  medical\n\nevidence in  the record, including Dr.  Bonilla's own written\n\nreport  of  her  examination  of  appellant.    And  we note,\n\nparenthetically, that had the ALJ instead adopted appellant's\n\ninterpretation,   reading   Dr.   Bonilla's   assessment   as\n\ninconsistent with the  other substantial medical  evidence in\n\n                             -10-\n\nthe  record, the  regulation  cited would  not, as  appellant\n\nargues,   have  required  the   assignment  of  \"controlling\"\n\nweight.1  \n\n      For the reasons stated, the decision below is affirmed.\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  Although 20  C.F.R.   404.1527, was  promulgated in final\nform  on August  1,  1991, while  this  case was  pending  on\nappeal, the  Secretary has not objected  to the applicability\nof the  regulation's approach in this case.   In light of our\nconclusions and the  lack of  objection, we have  no need  to\nconsider any questions of retroactivity. \n\n                             -11-\n</pre>",
