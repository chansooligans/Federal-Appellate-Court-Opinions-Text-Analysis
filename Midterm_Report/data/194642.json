This appeal arises  out of\n                                   \n\nthe calculation  of appellant's sentence under  the United States\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\").  Appellant  contends that the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in enhancing  his sentence  under U.S.S.G.\n\n  4A1.1(d) based on an outstanding  fine for a previous  offense.\n\nBecause we agree with the district court that the enhancement was\n\nwarranted in this case, we affirm.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          Appellant  pled  guilty  to unlawful  possession  of  a\n\nfirearm  by a  convicted  felon  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.   \n\n922(g)(1).    The  police   found  the  firearm  while  searching\n\nappellant's home for evidence of illegal gambling.  Appellant had\n\nseveral  prior felony convictions for  gambling.  At  the time of\n\nthe  search, appellant still  owed a $5000 fine  for one of these\n\nconvictions.\n\n          The presentence  report for the present  conviction set\n\nthe  base  offense level  at 12,  but  subtracted two  levels for\n\nacceptance  of   responsibility.    The  report   then  made  two\n\nadjustments for criminal  history.  First,  the report added  two\n\nlevels  for appellant's prior state gambling convictions pursuant\n\nto  U.S.S.G.     4A1.1.   Second,  the  report  added two  levels\n\npursuant to  U.S.S.G.     4A1.1 because  appellant  was  under  a\n\ncriminal  justice   sentence,  the  unpaid  fine,   for  a  prior\n\nconviction when  he committed  the present  offense.   These  two\n\nadjustments placed appellant at criminal history level III, which\n\ntogether with the base offense level of 10, yielded an applicable\n\n                               -2-\n\nrange of 10-16 months.  \n\n          Between the time of offense and the time of sentencing,\n\nthe base offense level for the felon in  possession crime rose by\n\ntwo  levels.   In such  a situation,  it is  proper to  apply the\n\nsentencing guidelines  applicable at the time  of offense, rather\n\nthan  the   normally  applicable   guidelines  at  the   time  of\n\nsentencing, in order  to avoid  violations of the  Ex Post  Facto\n                                                                 \n\nClause  of the  Constitution.   Id.    1B1.11.   The report  thus\n                                   \n\nrelied  on  the guidelines  as  they stood  at  the  time of  the\n\noffense, not at the time of sentencing.  \n\n          Appellant  objected  to  the  calculation  of  criminal\n\nhistory on two grounds.   First, he  argued that the unpaid  fine\n\nwas  not a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of U.S.S.G.\n\n  4A1.1(d).  Appellant  relied on an amendment to  the commentary\n\nthat became effective in November 1991 as support; he argued that\n\nthis  amendment  should  have  retroactive effect.    Second,  he\n\ncontended  that  the calculation  violated  the  Equal Protection\n\nClause,  in that treating a  fine as a  criminal justice sentence\n\ndisfavors indigent defendants who cannot pay fines quickly.   The\n\ndistrict court  judge disagreed  on each argument,  and sentenced\n\nappellant to 13 months  imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, and  2 years\n\nof supervised release.   Appellant revives  his objection to  the\n\ncriminal history calculation in this appeal.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          In 1990, we decided United States  v. Gallego, 905 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n482  (1st Cir.  1990).    There  we  held  that  \"the  sentencing\n\n                               -3-\n\nguidelines are perfectly clear that a fine is a 'criminal justice\n\nsentence'\"  and  therefore  triggers   the  U.S.S.G.     4A1.1(d)\n\nenhancement.    Id.  at 483.    In  November,  1991, a  so-called\n                   \n\nclarifying amendment to the application notes to that section was\n\nadded, stating that \"a sentence to  pay a fine, by itself,\" would\n\nnot trigger the enhancement.  We must determine whether, in light\n\nof our circuit  precedent to  the contrary, we  should apply  the\n\n1991  amendment   retroactively  to  the  1990   version  of  the\n\nguidelines in this case.\n\n          At  the   outset,  we  note  that   we  normally  apply\n\namendments retroactively  only if  they clarify a  guideline, but\n\nnot if they substantively  change a guideline.  Isabel  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 980 F.2d 60,  62 (1st Cir. 1992).  The  first step in our\n      \n\nanalysis, then, is to determine whether the amendment constitutes\n\na clarification or a substantive change.  We recognized in Isabel\n                                                                 \n\nthat  these categories were unclear,  id., and as  is usually the\n                                         \n\ncase, there are factors supporting either side.\n\n          On   the  one  hand,   the  United   States  Sentencing\n\nCommission  labeled  the  amendment  as a  clarification  of  the\n\nmeaning of a criminal justice sentence.  U.S.S.G. App. C  at 206,\n\n208.   Because  the 1990  guideline did  not say  explicitly that\n\nfines  were   or  were  not  criminal   justice  sentences,  this\n\ncharacterization does  not contravene  any specific  provision of\n\nthe guidelines themselves.\n\n          On the other  hand, our  holding in  Gallego weighs  in\n                                                      \n\nfavor of  characterizing the  amendment as a  substantive change.\n\n                               -4-\n\nGiven  that  holding,  the  amendment  alters  the  guideline  as\n\ninterpreted  by the  First Circuit.   Furthermore,  any amendment\n\nthat  is  inconsistent  with  the  clear  meaning  results  in  a\n\nsubstantive  change,  regardless of  the  Sentencing Commission's\n\ncharacterization.  United States v.  Ruiz Batista, 956 F.2d  351,\n                                                 \n\n353 (1st Cir.)  (\"if there was no ambiguity .  . . the Commission\n\ncould not change  [the] meaning  retroactively by  using a  magic\n\nword, clarification\"), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 105 (1992).   In\n                                   \n\nGallego  we held  it to  be \"perfectly  clear\" that  a fine  is a\n       \n\ncriminal justice sentence,  as that  term is used  in U.S.S.G.   \n\n4A1.1.  The contrary amendment  therefore would seem to represent\n\na substantive change, rather than a clarification.\n\n          Given  our  holding  in   Gallego,  we  rule  that  the\n                                           \n\namendment  was  not  a  clarification.    Rather,  the  amendment\n\npresented  a change  in the  meaning of  a clear  and unambiguous\n\nguideline.  As  the amendment was not a clarification,  it is not\n\nentitled to retroactive effect.   Accordingly, the district court\n\ndid not err in sentencing appellant.1\n\n          We  turn  now  to  appellant's  constitutional  claims.\n\nAppellant  insists that  he  is being  penalized  because he  was\n\npaying his  fine incrementally  according to a  state established\n\nschedule.  According to  appellant, the Fourteenth Amendment does\n\nnot permit criminal penalties due  to a defendant's inability  to\n\npay a fine.\n\n                    \n\n1  We will, of  course, apply the commentary in future  cases not\ninvolving retroactivity.  \n\n                               -5-\n\n          We disagree with appellant's analysis.  He is not being\n\npenalized  for nonpayment  of  a  fine.    Rather,  he  is  being\n\npenalized  because  that fine  is not  yet  due and  payable, and\n\ntherefore  appellant  is  still  subject to  a  criminal  justice\n\nsentence.  We have rejected similar claims on these very grounds.\n\nGallego,  905 F.2d at 483 n.2.   Furthermore, appellant is not an\n       \n\nindigent, and therefore  is not  entitled to  the protections  he\n\nclaims.   See  Bearden v.  Georgia, 461  U.S. 660,  664-69 (1983)\n                                  \n\n(distinguishing   between   indigents   and    nonindigents   for\n\nconstitutional   purposes).    Appellant's  sentence  invokes  no\n\nconstitutional concerns.\n\n          We  cannot conclude  without  a respectful  observation\n\nregarding   what  we  perceive  to   be  a  too  often  exercised\n\nprerogative  by  the  Sentencing   Commission,  that  of   making\n\nsignificant alterations to  the guidelines commentary accompanied\n\nby  a  suggestion  that  the  alteration  is  a  \"clarification.\"\n\nConsidering the thin line separating substance from clarification\n\nin this neural area of the law, we believe judicious restraint by\n\nthe Commission  would not  only avoid unnecessary  litigation and\n\nthe possible violation of constitutional rights, but would add to\n\nthe credibility of its action.  \n\n          The sentence is affirmed.\n                                  \n\n                               -6-\n",

This appeal arises  out of\n                                   \n\nthe calculation  of appellant's sentence under  the United States\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\").

These  two\n\nadjustments placed appellant at criminal history level III, which\n\ntogether with the base offense level of 10, yielded an applicable\n\n                               -2-\n\nrange of 10-16 months.  \n\n          Between the time of offense and the time of sentencing,\n\nthe base offense level for the felon in  possession crime rose by\n\ntwo  levels.

In  November,  1991, a  so-called\n                   \n\nclarifying amendment to the application notes to that section was\n\nadded, stating that \"a sentence to  pay a fine, by itself,\" would\n\nnot trigger the enhancement.  We must determine whether, in light\n\nof our circuit  precedent to  the contrary, we  should apply  the\n\n1991  amendment   retroactively  to  the  1990   version  of  the\n\nguidelines in this case.\n\n          At  the   outset,  we  note  that   we  normally  apply\n\namendments retroactively  only if  they clarify a  guideline, but\n\nnot if they substantively  change a guideline.  Isabel  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595487\"><a href=\"/opinion/595487/maurice-isabel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  62 (1st Cir. 1992).  The  first step in our\n      \n\nanalysis, then, is to determine whether the amendment constitutes\n\na clarification or a substantive change.  We recognized in Isabel\n                                                                 \n\nthat  these categories were unclear,  id., and as  is usually the\n                                         \n\ncase, there are factors supporting either side.\n\n          On   the  one  hand,   the  United   States  Sentencing\n\nCommission  labeled  the  amendment  as a  clarification  of  the\n\nmeaning of a criminal justice sentence.  U.S.S.G. App. C  at 206,\n\n208.   Because  the 1990  guideline did  not say  explicitly that\n\nfines  were   or  were  not  criminal   justice  sentences,  this\n\ncharacterization does  not contravene  any specific  provision of\n\nthe guidelines themselves.\n\n          On the other  hand, our  holding in  Gallego weighs  in\n                                                      \n\nfavor of  characterizing the  amendment as a  substantive change.\n\n                               -4-\n\nGiven  that  holding,  the  amendment  alters  the  guideline  as\n\ninterpreted  by the  First Circuit.   Furthermore,  any amendment\n\nthat  is  inconsistent  with  the  clear  meaning  results  in  a\n\nsubstantive  change,  regardless of  the  Sentencing Commission's\n\ncharacterization.

In\n                                   \n\nGallego  we held  it to  be \"perfectly  clear\" that  a fine  is a\n       \n\ncriminal justice sentence,  as that  term is used  in U.S.S.G.   \n\n4A1.1.  The contrary amendment  therefore would seem to represent\n\na substantive change, rather than a clarification.\n\n          Given  our  holding  in   Gallego,  we  rule  that  the\n                                           \n\namendment  was  not  a  clarification.    Rather,  the  amendment\n\npresented  a change  in the  meaning of  a clear  and unambiguous\n\nguideline.  As  the amendment was not a clarification,  it is not\n\nentitled to retroactive effect.   Accordingly, the district court\n\ndid not err in sentencing appellant.1\n\n          We  turn  now  to  appellant's  constitutional  claims.\n\nAppellant  insists that  he  is being  penalized  because he  was\n\npaying his  fine incrementally  according to a  state established\n\nschedule.  According to  appellant, the Fourteenth Amendment does\n\nnot permit criminal penalties due  to a defendant's inability  to\n\npay a fine.\n\n                    \n\n1  We will, of  course, apply the commentary in future  cases not\ninvolving retroactivity.  \n\n                               -5-\n\n          We disagree with appellant's analysis.  He is not being\n\npenalized  for nonpayment  of  a  fine.    Rather,  he  is  being\n\npenalized  because  that fine  is not  yet  due and  payable, and\n\ntherefore  appellant  is  still  subject to  a  criminal  justice\n\nsentence.  We have rejected similar claims on these very grounds.\n\nGallego,  905 F.2d at 483 n.2.   Furthermore, appellant is not an\n       \n\nindigent, and therefore  is not  entitled to  the protections  he\n\nclaims.   See  Bearden v.  Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110941\"><a href=\"/opinion/110941/bearden-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  664-69 (1983)\n                                  \n\n(distinguishing   between   indigents   and    nonindigents   for\n\nconstitutional   purposes).    Appellant's  sentence  invokes  no\n\nconstitutional concerns.\n\n          We  cannot conclude  without  a respectful  observation\n\nregarding   what  we  perceive  to   be  a  too  often  exercised\n\nprerogative  by  the  Sentencing   Commission,  that  of   making\n\nsignificant alterations to  the guidelines commentary accompanied\n\nby  a  suggestion  that  the  alteration  is  a  \"clarification.\"\n\nConsidering the thin line separating substance from clarification\n\nin this neural area of the law, we believe judicious restraint by\n\nthe Commission  would not  only avoid unnecessary  litigation and\n\nthe possible violation of constitutional rights, but would add to\n\nthe credibility of its action.  \n\n          The sentence is affirmed.\n                                  \n\n                               -6-\n</pre>",
