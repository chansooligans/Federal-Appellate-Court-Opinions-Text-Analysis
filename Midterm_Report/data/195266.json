Plaintiff Robert  Lena, an  inmate at  the\r                           \n\nNorfolk Correctional Institution in Massachusetts, challenges\n\nthe constitutionality of prison  rules barring the receipt of\n\npublications, ordered  through the  mail, that have  not been\n\npaid for  in advance.  See 103 NOR   403.25 (\"All orders must\r                                      \n\nbe pre-paid.  Any  order arriving with a balance due  will be\n\nreturned to  the company.\").   Below, plaintiff  advanced two\n\nclaims:  (1) that this  policy abridged his  rights under the\n\nFirst Amendment;  and (2) that prison  officials violated his\n\ndue   process  rights   by   failing  to   follow  applicable\n\nprocedures,  see 103 CMR   481.16, prior to returning a \"bill\r                            \n\nlater\"  book he  had ordered.   As  plaintiff has  offered no\n\nsustained  argumentation on  appeal in  support of  either of\n\nthese claims,  we affirm largely  for the reasons  recited by\n\nthe Magistrate-Judge in her decision dated July 16, 1993.  We\n\nnote only the following.\n\n     With respect to plaintiff's First Amendment claim, it is\n\nclear  that  the restriction  on  \"bill  later\" materials  is\n\n\"reasonably  related  to  legitimate penological  interests.\"\n\nTurner v. Safley, 482  U.S. 78, 89 (1987); see  Thornburgh v.\r                                                                      \n\nAbbott,  490 U.S.  401,  413 (1989)  (prison restrictions  on\r                  \n\nincoming  correspondence  are  to  be assessed  under  Turner\r                                                                         \n\ntest).    The superintendent  here  explained  that the  pre-\n\npayment  requirement  was  implemented  in  order  to prevent\n\ninmates  from committing  fraud on businesses  and obligating\r\n\nfunds   beyond   their  means.     Contrary   to  plaintiff's\n\ncontention,  the legitimacy  of these  justifications \"cannot\n\nseriously be questioned.\"  Rodriguez v. James, 823 F.2d 8, 12\r                                                         \n\n(2d  Cir. 1987).   Applying the  four criteria  enumerated in\n\nTurner, see  482 U.S. at  89-91, other courts  have uniformly\r                       \n\nupheld restrictions  similar to  that involved here  on First\n\nAmendment  grounds.    See,   e.g.,  Rodriguez,  supra  (rule\r                                                                  \n\nrequiring  that  all outgoing  mail  addressed  to commercial\n\nentities  be submitted  in unsealed  form for  inspection, to\n\nensure that  all items ordered have  been prepaid); Theriault\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Magnusson, 698 F. Supp.  369, 371-72 (D.

Dalimonte, 1991 WL 71034 (Magis. W.D.\r                                             \n\nMich. 1991) (ban on book-club memberships); see also Eckford-\r                                                                         \n\nEl  v.  Toombs, 760  F. Supp.  1267,  1271 (W.D.  Mich. 1991)\r                          \n\n(\"Prison officials  are justified in  forbidding inmates from\n\nentering  into   certain  kinds  of   credit  arrangements.\")\n\n(dicta).\n\n     With respect  to plaintiff's due process  claim, we need\n\nnot decide whether the pertinent state regulations suffice to\n\nestablish a property or liberty interest.  It is in any event\n\nclear that plaintiff  received all the process  that was due.\n\nThe fact that he was not provided with prompt, written notice\n\nof  the book's  return, as  required by  the  regulations, is\n\n                             -3-\r\n\nwithout consequence.   Plaintiff was  eventually so  notified\n\nand   was  able  to  pursue  an  appropriate  appeal  to  the\n\nsuperintendent.    In Procunier  v.  Martinez,  416 U.S.  396\r                                                         \n\n(1974), the  Court upheld restrictions on  incoming mail that\n\nrequired \"that  an inmate be  notified of the  rejection ...,\n\nthat [he]  ... be given  a reasonable opportunity  to protest\n\nthat decision, and  that complaints be  referred to a  prison\n\nofficial other than the person who originally disapproved the\n\ncorrespondence.\"   Id. at 418-19.   Each of  these safeguards\r                                  \n\nwas observed  here.  Contrary to  plaintiff's contention, the\n\nprison regulations  did not  require a hearing  prior to  the\n\nbook's return. \n\n     Plaintiff's central  argument on  appeal consists  of an\n\nequal  protection   claim  that  was  not   presented  below.\n\n\"[T]heories not raised squarely  in the district court cannot\n\nbe  surfaced for  the  first  time  on  appeal.\"    McCoy  v.\r                                                                     \n\nMassachusetts Institute  of Technology, 950 F.2d  13, 22 (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir. 1991), cert. denied,  112 S.
