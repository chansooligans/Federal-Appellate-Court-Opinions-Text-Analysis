Perez-\n\nPerez   alleged   that   while   defendant-appellant   Oscar\n\nBetancourt  Mateo (\"Betancourt\")  was  driving a  car leased\n\nfrom  defendant-appellant  Popular   Leasing  Rental,   Inc.\n\n(\"Popular\"), Betancourt negligently  struck and killed Maria\n\non  November 27, 1990, as she  was walking along the side of\n\nRoute 849  in Puerto  Rico.   A jury returned  a verdict  in\n\nPerez-Perez's favor  in the amount of  $275,000.  Betancourt\n\nand Popular appeal from the judgment entered on the  verdict\n\nby the  United States district  court of Puerto  Rico, Judge\n\nFuste,  and from  an order  denying defendants'  \"Motion For\n\nAlternative  Relief.\"    Defendants claim  that  relief from\n\njudgment is  necessary because  (1) the trial  testimony was\n\npoisoned  by  perjury,   (2)  plaintiff's  counsel  unfairly\n\nsurprised   the   defendants   by   introducing   previously\n\nundisclosed expert medical testimony concerning Betancourt's\n\neyesight,  and  (3)  the  verdict  was  excessive.    Before\n\nconsidering   these  issues,   however,  we   first  address\n\nplaintiff's  contention  that  this  court  lacks  appellate\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\njurisdiction because  the notice  of appeal and  the \"Motion\n\nfor Alternative Relief\"  were untimely filed.  We  find that\n\nwe  have  appellate  jurisdiction  to  consider  defendants'\n\ndirect appeal  from the district court judgment,  as well as\n\njurisdiction  to  consider the  district  court's  denial of\n\ndefendants' post  trial motion.   Because we  find that  the\n\ndistrict  court incorrectly  admitted  the testimony  of the\n\nplaintiff's medical expert, we reverse and remand  for a new\n\ntrial.\n\nI.   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n     Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)  requires any party appealing from\n\na judgment of the district court to file a notice  of appeal\n\nwithin 30 days  of the entry of the judgment.  Timely filing\n\nof  a notice  of appeal  is \"mandatory  and jurisdictional.\"\n\nBrowder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 264\n                                         \n\n(1978).   In  this  case,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the\n\ndefendants timely filed a notice of appeal from the district\n\ncourt's order denying the motion for alternative relief.  In\n\ncontrast, the  parties  dispute whether  timely  appeal  was\n\ntaken  from the  district  court's judgment  entered against\n\ndefendants on  April 22, 1992.   A notice of  appeal was not\n\nfiled until June 26, 1992, more than two months later.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n     If a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ.  P. 59 is timely filed  with the district court, the\n\ntime for appeal  runs from  the entry of  the order  denying\n\nsuch  motion.  Fed. R.  App. P. 4(a)(4).   Defendants invoke\n\nthe  tolling provisions  of  this rule  by describing  their\n\n\"Motion for Alternative Relief\"  as one timely brought under\n\nRule 59(e).  The motion was filed with the district court on\n\nApril 30, 1992, but  not served on Perez-Perez until  May 4,\n\n1992.  The timeliness of a  Rule 59 motion to amend judgment\n\nis  determined by the date it is  served, not by the date it\n\nis filed.  Rivera v.  M/T Fossarina, 840 F.2d 152,  154 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1988).  Though it might  appear that the motion was not\n\nfiled within the  requisite 10-day period,  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\n\n6(a) provides that the intermediate Saturdays and Sundays be\n\nexcluded  from the 10-day count.   Accordingly, we find that\n\nthe  motion was served on  the plaintiff within  ten days of\n\nthe  entry of  judgment.   This, however,  does not  end our\n\ninquiry.\n\n     Our  jurisdiction  over the  appeal  from  judgment (as\n\nopposed  to the appeal from the denial of the motion itself)\n\ndepends  on   whether  we  characterize   the  \"Motion   For\n\nAlternative Relief\" as one brought under Rule 59(e) or  Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P.  60(b).  A motion for relief  from judgment under\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nRule 60(b), unlike a  motion to amend a judgment  under Rule\n\n59(e), does not toll the 30-day appeal period.  Browder, 434\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at  263 n.7; Lopez  v. Corporacion Azucarera  de Puerto\n                                                            \n\nRico, 938 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir. 1991).  Our inquiry into\n    \n\nthe   character  of   the  motion   is  a   functional  one:\n\n\"nomenclature  should   not  be  exalted   over  substance.\"\n\nEchevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24, 26 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1988) (quoting Lyell Theatre Corp. v.  Loews Corp., 682\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 37, 41 (2nd  Cir. 1982)); 7 Moore's Federal  Practice  \n\n60.30[1]  (1992).    The  caption  \"Motion  for  Alternative\n\nRelief,\"  does not describe a motion under either Rule 59 or\n\nRule 60.   One of  the claims  for relief, remittitur  of an\n\nexcessive  verdict, is a classic  Rule 59 claim.   The other\n\nclaims,  surprise and misconduct,  are specifically referred\n\nto in Rule 60(b), and the defendants  appear to rely on Rule\n\n60(b)(1) in their memorandum to the district court.1 \n\n                    \n\n1 The district court entered the following order denying the\ndefendants' motion on June 12, 1992:\n\n          This final order will  start the counting  of\n     the term for appeal by defendants.\n\n          The court  now denies [defendants']  April 30\n     motion for relief against the verdict (JNOV) [sic]\n     and for new trial or remittitur.\n\n          IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n     Rule 59 provides  that a new trial may be  granted in a\n\njury action for any reason for which new trials were granted\n\nat  common law.  The rule creates the opportunity to correct\n\na broad panoply  of errors, in  order to prevent  injustice.\n\n11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil   \n\n2803, 2805  (1973).   In an  early case  under Rule 59,  the\n\nSupreme Court described the breadth of the rule:\n\n     The  motion  for  a   new  trial  may  invoke  the\n     discretion  of  the  court  in  so  far  as  it is\n     bottomed on the claim  that the verdict is against\n     the weight  of the evidence, that  the damages are\n     excessive, or, that, for  other reasons, the trial\n                                                       \n     was not  fair to the  party moving; and  may raise\n                                       \n     questions of law arising out of substantial errors\n     in   admission   or  rejection   of   evidence  or\n     instructions to the jury. \n\nMontgomery  Ward &amp; Co. v.  Duncan, 311 U.S.  243, 251 (1940)\n                                 \n\n(emphasis supplied).   It would  appear in general  that the\n\ngrounds  for relief from judgment under  Rule 60(b) may also\n\nbe  grounds for a new trial under  Rule 59, if the motion is\n\ntimely made.   11 Wright &amp; Miller, supra,    2805-2810.   In\n                                         \n\nConway v.  Chemical Leaman Tank  Lines, Inc., 687  F.2d 108,\n                                             \n\n112 (5th Cir. 1982), the court held that the grant  of a new\n\ntrial  under Rule  59 was  warranted when  a party  called a\n\n                    \n\n     If  the defendants' motion did not in fact qualify as a\nmotion under Rule  59, the  district court had  no power  to\nextend   the   time  for   filing   an   appeal,  which   is\njurisdictional.  Browder, 434 U.S. at 264.\n                        \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\npreviously  unidentified expert  witness to  testify without\n\nany forewarning,  resulting in a favorable  verdict for that\n\nparty.  This is precisely one of the instances of misconduct\n\nof  which the  defendants complain in  their motion  in this\n\ncase. \n\n     The  interrelation of Rules 59 and  60 was described by\n\nthe  court in  Van Skiver  v. United  States, 952  F.2d 1241\n                                            \n\n(10th Cir. 1991),  cert. denied,  113 S. Ct.  89 (1992),  as\n                               \n\nfollows:\n\n     [T]he rules allow a litigant subject to an adverse\n     judgment to file either a motion to alter or amend\n     the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P.  59(e) or a motion\n     seeking   relief   from   judgment   pursuant   to\n     Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  These two rules are distinct;\n     they   serve   different   purposes  and   produce\n     different  consequences.  Which  rule applies to a\n     motion depends essentially on the time a motion is\n     served.   If a motion is served within ten days of\n     the  rendition  of   judgment,  the  motion   will\n     ordinarily fall  under Rule 59(e).   If the motion\n     is  served after  that  time it  falls under  Rule\n     60(b).\n\nVan  Skiver, 952 F.2d at 1243 (citations omitted).  In other\n           \n\nwords,  the litigant who gets  his motion in  on time enjoys\n\nthe  full menu of grounds for relief provided by Rule 59; if\n\nnot,  he is confined to  the six specific  grounds of relief\n\nfound in Rule 60(b).\n\n     It  is  not  quite  that simple,  however,  because  of\n\nadditional  restraints which  the  courts  have  imposed  on\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nmotions brought under each rule.  Motions under Rule 59 must\n\nraise  matters that  were brought  to  the attention  of the\n\ndistrict judge  during the  trial, unless the  alleged error\n\nwas fundamental.  11 Wright &amp; Miller, supra,   2805; Harley-\n                                                            \n\nDavidson Motor Co. v. Bank  of New England-Old Colony, N.A.,\n                                                           \n\n897  F.2d 611,  616  (1st Cir.  1990).   Conversely, motions\n\nunder Rule 60(b)  must raise issues which were not available\n\nto  the  moving  party  within the  appeal  period,  barring\n\nexceptional circumstances.  Silk  v. Sandoval, 435 F.2d 1266\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S.  1012 (1971); Mitchell v.\n                                                            \n\nHobbs,  951 F.2d 417 (1st  Cir. 1991).   The relatively open\n     \n\nended  time  limits  of  Rule  60(b)  can  not  be  used  to\n\ncircumvent the time limitations on appeal.\n\n     A  further  question  is   raised  by  our  opinion  in\n\nEchevarria-Gonzalez  v. Gonzalez-Chapel,  in  which we  held\n                                          \n\nthat a motion  which invoked  Rule 60(b) and  relied on  the\n\nrhetoric of Rule 60(b) to support it, would not be construed\n\nas a motion under Rule 59 for purposes of tolling the appeal\n\nperiod, even though filed  within ten days of  the judgment,\n\nas required  by Rule 59.   Echevarria, 849 F.2d at  26.  The\n                                       \n\ncritical fact  in Echevarria,  however, was that  the motion\n                            \n\nsought relief from a  default judgment.  Under Fed.  R. Civ.\n\nP. 55, the only means of setting aside a default judgment is\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nby motion under  Rule 60(b);  the motion was  either a  Rule\n\n60(b) or nothing.\n\n     A more  general rule is  exemplified by our  opinion in\n\nLopez v. Corporacion, in  which we held that a  timely filed\n                    \n\nmotion could be treated  as filed under Rule 59  even though\n\nit  was  titled  \"Motion   for  Relief  From  Judgment\"  and\n\nostensibly filed pursuant to Rule 60(b).  Lopez, 938 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1513.   We  quoted with approval the statement  in a leading\n\ntext:\n\n     [A] motion, though characterized as one under Rule\n     60(b), which is filed within ten days of the entry\n     of judgment  and questions the correctness  of the\n     judgment,  will be considered a functional Rule 59\n     motion and will postpone  the time to appeal until\n     entry of the order disposing of it.\n\nId.  at  1513-14  (quoting  9  Moore's  Federal  Practice   \n   \n\n204.12[1]).  We distinguished  Echevarria on the ground that\n                                          \n\nthe  movant  in  Echevarria  sought relief  from  a  default\n                           \n\njudgment  and relied  on  cases construing  Rule 60(b),  and\n\nneither was true of the motion in Lopez.  Id. at 1514.\n                                             \n\n     In  our   present  case,   the   defendants  have   not\n\ncharacterized their motion  one way  or the other.   In  the\n\nsupporting memorandum filed in  the district court, the only\n\nrule reference is  to Rule  60(b), but is  a casual,  rather\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthan  an  exclusive,  one.2    They  have,  however,  relied\n\nheavily  on a  case decided  under  Rule 60(b),  Anderson v.\n                                                            \n\nCryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 924 (1st Cir. 1988).  But as we\n             \n\nhold infra, the propositions for which that case is cited is\n            \n\nequally applicable to a timely filed motion under Rule 59.\n\n     We find  the state  of the  record in  this case to  be\n\ncloser  to  Lopez than  to  Echevarria,  which  we  view  as\n                                      \n\nspecifically exemplary of the special rule affecting default\n\njudgments.    Accordingly,  we  rule  that  the  defendants'\n\nmotion,  having  been filed  within  the  ten-day period  as\n\ncomputed under Rule 6(a), may be construed as a motion under\n\nRule 59, the filing  of which postpones the time  for filing\n\nan appeal  until 30  days after the  motion's determination.\n\nThe subsequent  timely filing of the  appeal established our\n\nappellate jurisdiction.\n\nII.  Grounds for the Motion\n\n     Defendants' motion argued two grounds for setting aside\n\nthe jury verdict.  First, defendants alleged the trial was a\n\n                    \n\n2  \"Defendants contend - among other things - that a certain\nhappening  at trial  constituted conduct  violative of  Rule\n60(b)(3)  of  the Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure,  thus\npaving  the way for relief from judgment.   In the same vein\nthe conduct complained of, in addition to other conduct, ran\nafoul of section (b)(1) of the same Rule.\"\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nfraud on the court, claiming that a witness offered perjured\n\ntestimony with the assistance  of opposing counsel.

Fraud on the Court\n\n     Defendants must  clear a  high hurdle  in order  to set\n\naside  the verdict based on their allegations of fraud.  The\n\nmoving party must demonstrate  fraud by clear and convincing\n\nevidence  and must show  that the fraud  foreclosed full and\n\nfair  preparation or  presentation  of its  case.   We  have\n\nexplained that fraud on the court occurs,\n\n     where   it  can   be  demonstrated,   clearly  and\n     convincingly, that  a party has sentiently  set in\n     motion  some  unconscionable scheme  calculated to\n     interfere  with  the  judicial   system's  ability\n     impartially to adjudicate  a matter by  improperly\n     influencing  the trier  or unfairly  hampering the\n     presentation  of  the  opposing  party's  claim or\n     defense. \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nAoude  v. Mobil  Oil Corp.,  892 F.2d  1115, 1118  (1st Cir.\n                          \n\n1989).\n\n     When considered against these standards, it is clear to\n\nus  that the  district  court  properly  denied so  much  of\n\ndefendants'  motion  as   was  based   on  speculative   and\n\nunsubstantiated   allegations   of  perjury.     Defendants'\n\nargument centers on the trial testimony given by Luis Rafael\n\nVillanueva  Gaetan (\"Rafi\"),  the  only eye  witness to  the\n\naccident.   During  trial,  Rafi testified  that  as he  was\n\nwalking  down Route 849 he passed Maria, who was standing on\n\nthe  shoulder of the  road.  A  short time later  he heard a\n\n\"blow\" and turned to see Maria's body falling to the ground.\n\nRafi  explained that  Betancourt's car  was passing  just in\n\nfront of Maria's location  at the time her body  was falling\n\nto the pavement.   After  the car stopped  a short  distance\n\ndown  the  road,   Rafi  said that  he  ran to  the  car and\n\ninformed  the driver, who  was then inspecting  the front of\n\nhis  car, that  he had  struck a  pedestrian.   According to\n\nRafi, the driver  looked in the  direction of Maria's  body,\n\nthen returned to  his car  and drove off.   Rafi  identified\n\nBetancourt as the driver of the car.\n\n     On  cross-examination, Rafi  admitted that some  of the\n\ndetail  of his  trial testimony  was absent  from two  prior\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nsworn statements given by  him.  Defense counsel highlighted\n\ntwo   significant   additions   to   Rafi's   initial  sworn\n\nstatements.   First, while Rafi  testified at trial  that he\n\nsaw  Maria's  body  falling   to  the  pavement,  his  prior\n                                \n\nstatements implied that her body was already on the pavement\n                                               \n\nby  the  time  he turned  towards  the  sound  of the  blow.\n\nSecond, his trial testimony  placed Betancourt's car just in\n\nfront  of Maria at the  time of the  blow, while his initial\n\nstatements do not mention  the precise location of the  car,\n\nother than  the fact that it  came to a stop  down the road.\n\nTaking  these  inconsistencies  and adding  to  them  Rafi's\n\nadmission that  he had visited opposing  counsel's office to\n\nprepare his trial testimony, defendants charge that opposing\n\ncounsel and Rafi conspired to present perjured testimony.  \n\n     The  judge properly concluded that defendants failed to\n\npresent clear  and convincing  evidence that Rafi  committed\n\nperjury or  that opposing  counsel encouraged,   secured, or\n\nknowingly  assisted the  allegedly perjured  testimony.   We\n\nnote  that  one  purpose  of cross-examination  is  to  give\n\ncounsel   the  opportunity   to   root  out   the  type   of\n\ninconsistencies, omissions, and exaggerations  alleged here.\n\nOn  cross-examination, defendants raised before the jury the\n\nsame  facts that  are now  alleged on  appeal to  constitute\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nfraud on the court.  The significance of the inconsistencies\n\nin  Rafi's  testimony,  as   well  as  his  credibility  and\n\nsincerity, was for the jury to  decide and we see no  reason\n\nto  disturb  its  findings  or the  district  court's  order\n\ndenying relief from the verdict on this ground.\n\nB.   Undisclosed expert testimony\n\n     Defendants also  seek a new trial  because the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion  when it permitted the plaintiff\n\nto  introduce  the  testimony of  a  previously  undisclosed\n\nmedical  expert,  Dr.  Walter   Kleis,  who  testified  that\n\nBetancourt's  eyesight was  severely  impaired by  glaucoma.\n\nDr. Kleis testified that Betancourt's visual  impairment was\n\nso  severe  that it  could cause  him  to miss  a pedestrian\n\nwalking along the road under conditions similar to  those on\n\nthe evening of the accident.\n\n     Up to the time of  Dr. Kleis' testimony, plaintiff  had\n\npursued  the  case  under  the theory  that  Betancourt  was\n\ndriving with  \"utter disrespect toward human  life\" and that\n\n\"the accident was due only and exclusively to the negligence\n\nof  defendants [sic]  for  not driving  safely.\"   Plaintiff\n\nreaffirmed this as the  exclusive theory of the case  in the\n\ninitial pretrial order and two  amended pretrial orders.  At\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nno time  did plaintiff  suggest  that Betancourt's  eyesight\n\nwould  be raised  as an  issue at  trial, nor  did plaintiff\n\nidentify any medical experts who were to be called at trial.\n\nPlaintiff, nonetheless,  argued to  the district  court that\n\nDr.  Kleis'  testimony  should  be permitted  as  \"rebuttal\"\n\nevidence to  address an issue raised  by Betancourt's direct\n\nexamination.   Betancourt's entire direct  testimony on  the\n\nissue follows:\n\n     Q    Now, I note that you wear glasses.\n\n     A    Yes.\n\n     Q    Would  you tell  us, please,  what the  purpose of\n          those glasses are [sic].\n\n     A    The purpose of the glasses is to improve my vision\n          to  make it  better.    But  I can  drive  without\n          glasses.  I can see without glasses if I want to.\n\n     Plaintiff's  counsel  made   Betancourt's  eyesight   a\n\ncentral issue on cross-examination (more than a third of the\n\nrecord  testimony is  devoted to  cross-examination on  this\n\nissue).     Counsel's  examination  explored   the  physical\n\ncondition  of  Betancourt's  eyes,  namely the  presence  of\n\nglaucoma; his on-going medical treatment for this condition,\n\nincluding daily use of eye  drops and recent laser treatment\n\nof  one  eye; and  the effect  of  this condition  and these\n\ntreatments  on  his  peripheral   vision,  his  ability   to\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ndistinguish objects at a distance, and his ability to see in\n\nthe dark.\n\n     During Betancourt's  cross-examination, plaintiff asked\n\nthe  court for permission to present Dr. Kleis as a rebuttal\n\nwitness.  Counsel  stated that Dr. Kleis  would testify that\n\nbased  on  his  review  of  Betancourt's   medical  records,\n\nBetancourt suffered from  \"all kinds of problems in terms of\n\ncentralized and focusing vision,\" particularly after sunset,\n\nand that  he should not  have been  driving a car  at night.\n\nThe  court initially  denied plaintiff's  request, reasoning\n\nthat  the pretrial order made no mention of a medical expert\n\nand that the proffered testimony  raised an entirely new and\n\ninconsistent theory of the case.  The judge later decided to\n\nhear  the testimony of Dr. Kleis outside the presence of the\n\njury.   At  that  time, the  court learned  that plaintiff's\n\ncounsel had  first contacted Dr. Kleis  around the beginning\n\nof January 1992 at which time counsel told Dr. Kleis that it\n\nwas likely that he  would testify at trial.   Plaintiff made\n\nno similar representation to the court or to defense counsel\n\nat  any time  prior to  trial in  April 1992,  despite twice\n\nseeking to  amend the pretrial  order to reflect  changes in\n\nwitnesses   and  other   evidence.    The   court  addressed\n\nplaintiff's  counsel, concluding  that he  would  permit Dr.\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nKleis to  testify before the jury  \"as an act of  justice to\n\nyour client, not to you.  You did wrong.\"\n\n     Dr.  Kleis  testified  for  the  jury  that  Betancourt\n\nsuffered from glaucoma, a medical condition of the eyes that\n\nreduces an  individual's  peripheral vision,  especially  at\n\nnight.    He  stated  that  the  eye  drops  used  to  treat\n\nBetancourt's  glaucoma made  his  pupils very  small,  which\n\nfurther  reduced  his  visual  capacity.   In  addition,  he\n\ntestified that  Betancourt suffered from myopia, a condition\n\nthat impaired his ability to see objects at a distance.  Dr.\n\nKleis explained that taken  together, these conditions would\n\nmake it difficult for Betancourt to see and perceive objects\n\nat  the  periphery   of  his  vision.     Responding  to   a\n\nhypothetical question,  Dr. Kleis concluded  that under  the\n\nlighting and driving conditions on the night of the accident\n\nthere  was a  possibility that  Betancourt did  not  see the\n\nvictim  on the  side  of  the  road.    Finally,  Dr.  Kleis\n\ntestified that Betancourt had undergone laser surgery on his\n\nleft eye shortly after the accident.\n\n     In this case, the trial court's own findings compel the\n\nconclusion  that the  defendant  was unfairly  surprised and\n\nthat plaintiff's  counsel engaged in misconduct.   Though we\n\nbelieve that the judge abused  his discretion with regard to\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nhis  ultimate decision  to admit  Dr. Kleis'  testimony, his\n\ninitial reaction  was correct  and we defer  to the  judge's\n\nwell-considered findings  of fact.   The judge  made several\n\ngermane findings on  the record.   The judge concluded  that\n\n(1) Dr. Kleis' testimony was not proper rebuttal evidence of\n\nan  issue  put  into  dispute on  direct  examination;3  (2)\n\nplaintiff's counsel  \"knew for a long  time\" that Betancourt\n\nsuffered from glaucoma and that  \"at least since January  []\n\nhad  Dr. Kleis  available  to testify;\"  (3)  there was  \"no\n\nexcuse as to why [counsel] kept [Dr. Kleis' testimony] under\n\n[his]  sleeve  until this  moment;\"  and  (4) the  proffered\n\ntestimony  changed the theory of the case from a charge that\n\nBetancourt drove recklessly to an allegation that Betancourt\n\nwas \"driving like normal  people do, and that because  of an\n\neyesight  problem he had the  accident.\"  In  spite of these\n\nfindings, the  judge ultimately decided to  admit Dr. Kleis'\n\ntestimony  as an \"act  of justice\" to  the plaintiff, noting\n\n                    \n\n3   Plaintiff  contends  that   Dr.  Kleis'   testimony  was\nadmissible  under  the terms  of  the  pretrial order  which\nexpressly  reserved   to  the   parties  a  right   to  call\nundisclosed rebuttal witness.  The judge determined that Dr.\nKleis was not a proper rebuttal witness.  This determination\n             \nis within  the sound discretion of the trial judge, Lubanski\n                                                            \nv. Coleco Indus., Inc., 929 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 1991), and\n                      \nwe are in full agreement with it.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nthat  the situation was totally beyond plaintiff's control.4\n\n     In  this  case,  Dr.  Kleis'  testimony  and  counsel's\n\nextensive  cross-examination of  Betancourt  on  his  visual\n\nimpairment, introduced  a novel theory of  liability to this\n\ncase.  Defense counsel was denied the opportunity  to design\n\nan intelligent litigation strategy  to address the charge of\n\nvisual impairment and to effectively cross-examine Dr. Kleis\n\nin  a highly specialized field of medicine.  Without time to\n\nreview  Dr. Kleis'  records  or to  gain sufficient  medical\n\nknowledge and  without a chance to  investigate Betancourt's\n\nphysical condition, speak to  his primary care physician, or\n\narrange for a rebuttal expert, defense counsel was precluded\n\nfrom effectively addressing the charge.  \n\n     We  have no doubt that this state of the record exactly\n\ncomports with the definition  of unfair surprise  succinctly\n\nset out by the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit:\n\n     It is well settled  that Rule 59 provides a  means\n     of  relief in  cases  in which  a  party has  been\n     unfairly  made  the  victim  of   surprise.    The\n     surprise,  however,  must  be  \"inconsistent  with\n\n                    \n\n4  We  are  aware  of the  difficulty  of  excluding  highly\nrelevant  and perhaps  dispositive testimony  which apparent\nsubstantive justice  requires should  be  considered by  the\njury.    Apparent  substantive  justice   may  be  illusory,\nhowever,  if  the  purportedly dispositive  evidence  is not\nsubject to fair testing in an even handed process.\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\n     substantial justice\" in  order to justify  a grant\n     of  a new trial.  The  district court is therefore\n     entitled  to  grant  a   new  trial  only  if  the\n     admission  of  the  surprise   testimony  actually\n     prejudiced the [moving party's]  case.  This Court\n     has limited reversible error from  unfair surprise\n     to  situations where  a  completely  new issue  is\n     suddenly  raised  or  a   previously  unidentified\n     expert witness is suddenly called to testify.\n\nConway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 687 F.2d at 111-\n                                          \n\n12  (footnote  and  citations  omitted).    Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict  judge  made a  specific  finding that  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel had been guilty of misconduct.  On the facts of this\n\ncase,  the criteria  for misconduct  which we  imposed under\n\nRule 60(b) in Anderson v. Cryovac, 862 F.2d at 923-26, apply\n                                 \n\nequally  to  this motion  under Rule  59.   Reversal  of the\n\njudgment and a  remand for  a new trial  is warranted  under\n\neither analysis.\n\n     We  need not  address defendants'  claim that  the jury\n\naward was excessive,  since in any case there  must be a new\n\ntrial.   The judgment is  reversed and the  case remanded to\n                                                         \n\nthe district court for a new trial.\n\n     Costs awarded to appellants.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n",

A notice of  appeal was not\n\nfiled until June 26, 1992, more than two months later.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n     If a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.\n\nR.

The\n                                       \n\ncritical fact  in Echevarria,  however, was that  the motion\n                            \n\nsought relief from a  default judgment.  Under Fed.  R.

In the same vein\nthe conduct complained of, in addition to other conduct, ran\nafoul of section (b)(1) of the same Rule.\"\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nfraud on the court, claiming that a witness offered perjured\n\ntestimony with the assistance  of opposing counsel.  Second,\n\ndefendants  argued they  were  unfairly  surprised at  trial\n\nbecause  the  court  allowed  the  plaintiff  to  offer  the\n\ntestimony  of  a  previously  undisclosed   medical  expert.\n\nOrdering the presentation of witnesses and the granting of a\n\nnew trial are  both matters committed  to the discretion  of\n\nthe  trial  court, and  may be  reversed  only for  abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

Fraud on the Court\n\n     Defendants must  clear a  high hurdle  in order  to set\n\naside  the verdict based on their allegations of fraud.  The\n\nmoving party must demonstrate  fraud by clear and convincing\n\nevidence  and must show  that the fraud  foreclosed full and\n\nfair  preparation or  presentation  of its  case.   We  have\n\nexplained that fraud on the court occurs,\n\n     where   it  can   be  demonstrated,   clearly  and\n     convincingly, that  a party has sentiently  set in\n     motion  some  unconscionable scheme  calculated to\n     interfere  with  the  judicial   system's  ability\n     impartially to adjudicate  a matter by  improperly\n     influencing  the trier  or unfairly  hampering the\n     presentation  of  the  opposing  party's  claim or\n     defense. \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nAoude  v.

Defendants'\n\nargument centers on the trial testimony given by Luis Rafael\n\nVillanueva  Gaetan (\"Rafi\"),  the  only eye  witness to  the\n\naccident.   During  trial,  Rafi testified  that  as he  was\n\nwalking  down Route 849 he passed Maria, who was standing on\n\nthe  shoulder of the  road.  A  short time later  he heard a\n\n\"blow\" and turned to see Maria's body falling to the ground.\n\nRafi  explained that  Betancourt's car  was passing  just in\n\nfront of Maria's location  at the time her body  was falling\n\nto the pavement.   After  the car stopped  a short  distance\n\ndown  the  road,   Rafi  said that  he  ran to  the  car and\n\ninformed  the driver, who  was then inspecting  the front of\n\nhis  car, that  he had  struck a  pedestrian.   According to\n\nRafi, the driver  looked in the  direction of Maria's  body,\n\nthen returned to  his car  and drove off.   Rafi  identified\n\nBetancourt as the driver of the car.\n\n     On  cross-examination, Rafi  admitted that some  of the\n\ndetail  of his  trial testimony  was absent  from two  prior\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nsworn statements given by  him.  Defense counsel highlighted\n\ntwo   significant   additions   to   Rafi's   initial  sworn\n\nstatements.   First, while Rafi  testified at trial  that he\n\nsaw  Maria's  body  falling   to  the  pavement,  his  prior\n                                \n\nstatements implied that her body was already on the pavement\n                                               \n\nby  the  time  he turned  towards  the  sound  of the  blow.\n\nSecond, his trial testimony  placed Betancourt's car just in\n\nfront  of Maria at the  time of the  blow, while his initial\n\nstatements do not mention  the precise location of the  car,\n\nother than  the fact that it  came to a stop  down the road.\n\nTaking  these  inconsistencies  and adding  to  them  Rafi's\n\nadmission that  he had visited opposing  counsel's office to\n\nprepare his trial testimony, defendants charge that opposing\n\ncounsel and Rafi conspired to present perjured testimony.  \n\n     The  judge properly concluded that defendants failed to\n\npresent clear  and convincing  evidence that Rafi  committed\n\nperjury or  that opposing  counsel encouraged,   secured, or\n\nknowingly  assisted the  allegedly perjured  testimony.   We\n\nnote  that  one  purpose  of cross-examination  is  to  give\n\ncounsel   the  opportunity   to   root  out   the  type   of\n\ninconsistencies, omissions, and exaggerations  alleged here.\n\nOn  cross-examination, defendants raised before the jury the\n\nsame  facts that  are now  alleged on  appeal to  constitute\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nfraud on the court.  The significance of the inconsistencies\n\nin  Rafi's  testimony,  as   well  as  his  credibility  and\n\nsincerity, was for the jury to  decide and we see no  reason\n\nto  disturb  its  findings  or the  district  court's  order\n\ndenying relief from the verdict on this ground.\n\nB.   Undisclosed expert testimony\n\n     Defendants also  seek a new trial  because the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion  when it permitted the plaintiff\n\nto  introduce  the  testimony of  a  previously  undisclosed\n\nmedical  expert,  Dr.  Walter   Kleis,  who  testified  that\n\nBetancourt's  eyesight was  severely  impaired by  glaucoma.\n\nDr. Kleis testified that Betancourt's visual  impairment was\n\nso  severe  that it  could cause  him  to miss  a pedestrian\n\nwalking along the road under conditions similar to  those on\n\nthe evening of the accident.\n\n     Up to the time of  Dr. Kleis' testimony, plaintiff  had\n\npursued  the  case  under  the theory  that  Betancourt  was\n\ndriving with  \"utter disrespect toward human  life\" and that\n\n\"the accident was due only and exclusively to the negligence\n\nof  defendants [sic]  for  not driving  safely.\"   Plaintiff\n\nreaffirmed this as the  exclusive theory of the case  in the\n\ninitial pretrial order and two  amended pretrial orders.  At\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nno time  did plaintiff  suggest  that Betancourt's  eyesight\n\nwould  be raised  as an  issue at  trial, nor  did plaintiff\n\nidentify any medical experts who were to be called at trial.\n\nPlaintiff, nonetheless,  argued to  the district  court that\n\nDr.  Kleis'  testimony  should  be permitted  as  \"rebuttal\"\n\nevidence to  address an issue raised  by Betancourt's direct\n\nexamination.   Betancourt's entire direct  testimony on  the\n\nissue follows:\n\n     Q    Now, I note that you wear glasses.\n\n     A    Yes.\n\n     Q    Would  you tell  us, please,  what the  purpose of\n          those glasses are [sic].\n\n     A    The purpose of the glasses is to improve my vision\n          to  make it  better.    But  I can  drive  without\n          glasses.  I can see without glasses if I want to.\n\n     Plaintiff's  counsel  made   Betancourt's  eyesight   a\n\ncentral issue on cross-examination (more than a third of the\n\nrecord  testimony is  devoted to  cross-examination on  this\n\nissue).     Counsel's  examination  explored   the  physical\n\ncondition  of  Betancourt's  eyes,  namely the  presence  of\n\nglaucoma; his on-going medical treatment for this condition,\n\nincluding daily use of eye  drops and recent laser treatment\n\nof  one  eye; and  the effect  of  this condition  and these\n\ntreatments  on  his  peripheral   vision,  his  ability   to\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ndistinguish objects at a distance, and his ability to see in\n\nthe dark.\n\n     During Betancourt's  cross-examination, plaintiff asked\n\nthe  court for permission to present Dr. Kleis as a rebuttal\n\nwitness.  Counsel  stated that Dr. Kleis  would testify that\n\nbased  on  his  review  of  Betancourt's   medical  records,\n\nBetancourt suffered from  \"all kinds of problems in terms of\n\ncentralized and focusing vision,\" particularly after sunset,\n\nand that  he should not  have been  driving a car  at night.\n\nThe  court initially  denied plaintiff's  request, reasoning\n\nthat  the pretrial order made no mention of a medical expert\n\nand that the proffered testimony  raised an entirely new and\n\ninconsistent theory of the case.  The judge later decided to\n\nhear  the testimony of Dr. Kleis outside the presence of the\n\njury.   At  that  time, the  court learned  that plaintiff's\n\ncounsel had  first contacted Dr. Kleis  around the beginning\n\nof January 1992 at which time counsel told Dr. Kleis that it\n\nwas likely that he  would testify at trial.   Plaintiff made\n\nno similar representation to the court or to defense counsel\n\nat  any time  prior to  trial in  April 1992,  despite twice\n\nseeking to  amend the pretrial  order to reflect  changes in\n\nwitnesses   and  other   evidence.    The   court  addressed\n\nplaintiff's  counsel, concluding  that he  would  permit Dr.\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nKleis to  testify before the jury  \"as an act of  justice to\n\nyour client, not to you.  You did wrong.\"\n\n     Dr.  Kleis  testified  for  the  jury  that  Betancourt\n\nsuffered from glaucoma, a medical condition of the eyes that\n\nreduces an  individual's  peripheral vision,  especially  at\n\nnight.    He  stated  that  the  eye  drops  used  to  treat\n\nBetancourt's  glaucoma made  his  pupils very  small,  which\n\nfurther  reduced  his  visual  capacity.   In  addition,  he\n\ntestified that  Betancourt suffered from myopia, a condition\n\nthat impaired his ability to see objects at a distance.  Dr.\n\nKleis explained that taken  together, these conditions would\n\nmake it difficult for Betancourt to see and perceive objects\n\nat  the  periphery   of  his  vision.     Responding  to   a\n\nhypothetical question,  Dr. Kleis concluded  that under  the\n\nlighting and driving conditions on the night of the accident\n\nthere  was a  possibility that  Betancourt did  not  see the\n\nvictim  on the  side  of  the  road.    Finally,  Dr.  Kleis\n\ntestified that Betancourt had undergone laser surgery on his\n\nleft eye shortly after the accident.\n\n     In this case, the trial court's own findings compel the\n\nconclusion  that the  defendant  was unfairly  surprised and\n\nthat plaintiff's  counsel engaged in misconduct.   Though we\n\nbelieve that the judge abused  his discretion with regard to\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nhis  ultimate decision  to admit  Dr. Kleis'  testimony, his\n\ninitial reaction  was correct  and we defer  to the  judge's\n\nwell-considered findings  of fact.   The judge  made several\n\ngermane findings on  the record.   The judge concluded  that\n\n(1) Dr. Kleis' testimony was not proper rebuttal evidence of\n\nan  issue  put  into  dispute on  direct  examination;3  (2)\n\nplaintiff's counsel  \"knew for a long  time\" that Betancourt\n\nsuffered from glaucoma and that  \"at least since January  []\n\nhad  Dr. Kleis  available  to testify;\"  (3)  there was  \"no\n\nexcuse as to why [counsel] kept [Dr. Kleis' testimony] under\n\n[his]  sleeve  until this  moment;\"  and  (4) the  proffered\n\ntestimony  changed the theory of the case from a charge that\n\nBetancourt drove recklessly to an allegation that Betancourt\n\nwas \"driving like normal  people do, and that because  of an\n\neyesight  problem he had the  accident.\"  In  spite of these\n\nfindings, the  judge ultimately decided to  admit Dr. Kleis'\n\ntestimony  as an \"act  of justice\" to  the plaintiff, noting\n\n                    \n\n3   Plaintiff  contends  that   Dr.  Kleis'   testimony  was\nadmissible  under  the terms  of  the  pretrial order  which\nexpressly  reserved   to  the   parties  a  right   to  call\nundisclosed rebuttal witness.  The judge determined that Dr.\nKleis was not a proper rebuttal witness.  This determination\n             \nis within  the sound discretion of the trial judge, Lubanski\n                                                            \nv.

Defense counsel was denied the opportunity  to design\n\nan intelligent litigation strategy  to address the charge of\n\nvisual impairment and to effectively cross-examine Dr. Kleis\n\nin  a highly specialized field of medicine.  Without time to\n\nreview  Dr. Kleis'  records  or to  gain sufficient  medical\n\nknowledge and  without a chance to  investigate Betancourt's\n\nphysical condition, speak to  his primary care physician, or\n\narrange for a rebuttal expert, defense counsel was precluded\n\nfrom effectively addressing the charge.  \n\n     We  have no doubt that this state of the record exactly\n\ncomports with the definition  of unfair surprise  succinctly\n\nset out by the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit:\n\n     It is well settled  that Rule 59 provides a  means\n     of  relief in  cases  in which  a  party has  been\n     unfairly  made  the  victim  of   surprise.    The\n     surprise,  however,  must  be  \"inconsistent  with\n\n                    \n\n4  We  are  aware  of the  difficulty  of  excluding  highly\nrelevant  and perhaps  dispositive testimony  which apparent\nsubstantive justice  requires should  be  considered by  the\njury.    Apparent  substantive  justice   may  be  illusory,\nhowever,  if  the  purportedly dispositive  evidence  is not\nsubject to fair testing in an even handed process.\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\n     substantial justice\" in  order to justify  a grant\n     of  a new trial.  The  district court is therefore\n     entitled  to  grant  a   new  trial  only  if  the\n     admission  of  the  surprise   testimony  actually\n     prejudiced the [moving party's]  case.  This Court\n     has limited reversible error from  unfair surprise\n     to  situations where  a  completely  new issue  is\n     suddenly  raised  or  a   previously  unidentified\n     expert witness is suddenly called to testify.\n\nConway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 687 F.2d at 111-\n                                          \n\n12  (footnote  and  citations  omitted).    Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict  judge  made a  specific  finding that  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel had been guilty of misconduct.  On the facts of this\n\ncase,  the criteria  for misconduct  which we  imposed under\n\nRule 60(b) in Anderson v. Cryovac, 862 F.2d at 923-26, apply\n                                 \n\nequally  to  this motion  under Rule  59.   Reversal  of the\n\njudgment and a  remand for  a new trial  is warranted  under\n\neither analysis.\n\n     We  need not  address defendants'  claim that  the jury\n\naward was excessive,  since in any case there  must be a new\n\ntrial.   The judgment is  reversed and the  case remanded to\n                                                         \n\nthe district court for a new trial.\n\n     Costs awarded to appellants.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n</pre>",
