In this  appeal, plaintiff-appellant\n                     \n\nRobert Plouffe claims that  the district court (1) improperly\n\nvacated an entry  of default in order to reach  the merits of\n\nhis book account claim; and (2) erred when, upon reaching the\n\nmerits,  it declined to pierce the corporate veil in order to\n\nhold  defendants-appellees Bruce  and Pamela  Ross personally\n\nliable on the claim.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          In  1983, Bruce  and Pamela  Ross formed  New Pace,\n\nInc.  (hereinafter \"New Pace\"),  a Massachusetts corporation,\n\nin  order to own and operate hobby shops in Massachusetts and\n\nNew  Hampshire.    From  approximately  1983  to  1990,  they\n\npurchased hobby supplies  for their stores from  Plouffe.  By\n\n1990, however, the stores had failed, the corporation and the\n\nRosses were insolvent, and Plouffe was owed over $61,000.\n\n          In  May  of  1990,  Plouffe  commenced  a diversity\n\naction  in Rhode  Island Federal  District Court  against New\n\nPace and against  the Rosses individually  for the amount  of\n\nthe debt.  The  Rosses failed to answer the  complaint within\n\ntwenty days as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a), and Plouffe\n\npromptly filed for an entry of  default under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n55.   \n\n          Subsequent  to  the  entry  of  default,  New  Pace\n\nadmitted  liability  on the  full amount  of  the debt.   The\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nRosses, however, denying personal liability,  moved to vacate\n\nthe  entry  of default  against  them.    A Magistrate  Judge\n\ngranted the motion to vacate, and the case went to trial.\n\n          The  sole  issue at  the  one-day  bench trial  was\n\nwhether the Rosses  should be held personally  liable for New\n\nPace's debt.  The evidence at trial  showed that New Pace had\n\nfailed  to observe  several corporate  formalities, including\n\nrecord-keeping and holding annual meetings.   The corporation\n\nhad, however, filed corporate income tax  returns, maintained\n\na separate corporate bank  account, and made all  payments to\n\nPlouffe from  the corporate account.   Moreover, the district\n\ncourt  found no bad faith or  misuse of the corporate form by\n\nthe Rosses.   Accordingly, it declined  Plouffe's entreaty to\n\ndisregard the  corporate form and hold  the Rosses personally\n\nliable  on  New Pace's  debt.   As  noted above,  Plouffe now\n\nargues  that the  district court  erred in  (1)  vacating the\n\nentry of default; (2) refusing to hold  the Rosses personally\n\nliable on the debt.  We address these arguments in turn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  The Default\n               \n\n            While there is no precise formula for determining\n\nwhen to set aside a default, a district court should consider\n\n\"`whether the  default was willful, whether  setting it aside\n\nwould  prejudice  the adversary,  and  whether a  meritorious\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ndefense is  presented.'\" Leshore v. County  of Worcester, 945\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 471, 472 (1st  Cir. 1991) (quoting Coon v.  Grenier, 867\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  73,  76  (1st  Cir. 1989))  (citation  omitted).    Our\n\nstandard  of review  on appeal is  deferential.   \"A district\n\ncourt's action on a motion to set aside a default lies within\n\nthe court's  sound discretion  and should be  overturned only\n\nfor abuse of that discretion.\"  Id.  Moreover, we are  guided\n                                   \n\nby  the  \"`philosophy  that  actions   should  ordinarily  be\n\nresolved on their merits.'\"   Id. (quoting Coon, 876  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n76).\n\n          A  careful review of the record in the instant case\n\nsatisfies us  that the Magistrate Judge  properly weighed the\n\nfactors  of  willfulness,  prejudice  and the  merit  of  the\n\ndefense  in  vacating  the  entry of  default.    The  record\n\npresents  no  evidence  of  willful default  by  the  Rosses;\n\nPlouffe  failed  to articulate  any  prejudice;1  and, as  is\n\ndemonstrated more fully infra,  the Rosses' defense that they\n                             \n\nwere  not personally  liable for  the debts  of New  Pace was\n\nmeritorious.  Accordingly, we find no  abuse of discretion in\n\nthe Magistrate Judge's order vacating the entry of default.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  Both below  and on appeal, Plouffe  has insisted, without\nelaboration,  that he was  prejudiced by the  passage of time\nwhich  followed the  default.  We  agree with  the Magistrate\nJudge that, Plouffe's  insistence aside, the record  provides\nno evidence of prejudice due to the passage of time.\n\n2.  Plouffe  also argues that he  is entitled to  the cost of\npersonal service on New Pace and the Rosses because he served\nthem  once   by  mail,   received  no   acknowledgement,  and\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nB.  Piercing the Corporate Veil\n                               \n\n          Plouffe's second ground for appeal fares no better.\n\nRelying almost exclusively on  the Rosses' failure to observe\n\ncorporate formalities, Plouffe argues that the district court\n\nerred  in declining to pierce the corporate veil and hold the\n\nRosses personally liable on New Pace's debt.\n\n          Under  Massachusetts  law,3   while  disregard   of\n\ncorporate formalities is one  factor which courts consider in\n\ndetermining whether  to  disregard the  corporate  form,  see\n                                                             \n\nEvans  v.  Multicon Constr.  Corp.,  574  N.E.2d 395,  398-99\n                                  \n\n(Mass.  App. Ct.  1991);  Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co.  v.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\nsubsequently effected personal service as required by Fed. R.\nCiv.  P.  4(c)(2)(C)(ii).    Costs  are  allowed  in  such  a\nsituation  \"[u]nless good cause is  shown.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P.\n4(c)(2)(D).   In the instant case, the Magistrate Judge heard\nevidence  on  the  Rosses'  failure  to  acknowledge service,\nincluding their assertions that  they were preoccupied trying\nto keep their business afloat and that they had no counsel in\nRhode Island.   Based on this evidence, the  Magistrate Judge\ndetermined that  good cause  had been  shown for the  Rosses'\nfailure to acknowledge service by mail.  Plouffe v. New Pace,\n                                                             \nInc.,  1992  WL  426456,  at  *1  (D.R.I.   July  19,  1992).\n    \nReviewing  this determination  under  an abuse  of discretion\nstandard, Coon, 867 F.2d at 76, we find nothing in the record\n              \nwhich  would warrant reversing the Magistrate Judge's finding\nof good cause.  \n          To the  extent that  Plouffe seeks other  costs and\nattorney's fees, he does so in a perfunctory manner.  We have\noften  warned that  arguments made  in a  perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,  are\ndeemed waived.    Federal Deposit  Ins. Co.  v. World  Univ.,\n                                                             \nInc.,  978  F.2d 10,  15 (1st  Cir.  1992).   Accordingly, we\n    \nreject Plouffe's additional requests for costs and attorney's\nfees.\n\n3.  The parties do not dispute that Massachusetts law governs\nthe issue of  whether the  Rosses are to  be held  personally\nliable for New Pace's debts.  \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nCheckers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 14-16  (1st Cir. 1985) (applying\n              \n\nMassachusetts  law), it is by no means the sole determinative\n\nfactor.   Rather, courts examine a series of factors to \"form\n\nan opinion  whether  the  over-all  structure  and  operation\n\nmisleads.\"    Evans,  574  N.E.2d   at  400.    Of  paramount\n                   \n\nimportance is  the fact that, without  exception, \"[t]here is\n\npresent in the  cases which have looked through the corporate\n\nform  an  element of  dubious  manipulation  and contrivance,\n\nfinagling,  such that corporate  identities are  confused and\n\nthird  parties  cannot be  quite certain  with what  they are\n\ndealing.\"  Id.\n              \n\n          After hearing Bruce  Ross's testimony and reviewing\n\nall of the evidence at trial, the district court specifically\n\nfound no such dubious manipulation or contrivance on the part\n\nof  the  Rosses.4   We  find  nothing  to  suggest that  this\n\nfactual finding was erroneous.   \n\n           In addition, while the Rosses'  record-keeping was\n\nclearly  insufficient under  Massachusetts law, we  note that\n\nNew Pace met its corporate obligations at least to the extent\n\nthat it  (1) filed  corporate tax returns;  (2) maintained  a\n\nseparate  corporate  bank  account;   and  (3)  paid  Plouffe\n\nexclusively from this corporate account.  In sum, the  record\n\n                    \n\n4.  In its final order, the district stated: \"There is simply\nno doubt that the defendant, Mr. Ross, is not a conniver.  He\nis  merely   unsophisticated   and  ignorant   of   corporate\nniceties.\"  \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\noffers no  evidence suggesting that the  Rosses' conduct rose\n\nto a  level which justifies disregarding  the corporate form.\n\nAccordingly,  we  decline  to  disturb  the  district court's\n\nverdict in favor of the Rosses.5  \n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,   the  order  of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                    \n\n5.  Plouffe also  argues that the Rosses  assumed or admitted\npersonal  liability on New Pace's debt when Bruce Ross sent a\nletter  to his  creditors,  including Plouffe,  promising  to\nrepay  his debts.    It is  well  established that  where  an\nindividual  assumes personal  responsibility for  a corporate\ndebt  due  to  a belief  that  s/he  is  morally, though  not\nlegally, inclined to do so,  such an agreement is  gratuitous\nand unenforceable  due to lack of consideration.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \nGishen  v. Dura  Corp.,  285 N.E.2d  117,  123 (Mass.  1972).\n                      \nBruce  Ross's  testimony at  trial,  as  well as  his  letter\npromising  to  pay New  Pace's  debts,  established that  his\npromise  to  pay  was  exactly  such  a  gratuitous  promise.\nAccordingly, we  agree with  the district court's  finding of\nunenforceability.\n          In  addition,  Plouffe   raises  issues  of  unjust\nenrichment  and quasi-contract.    To the  extent that  these\narguments were made to the district court, they were  offered\nfor  the first time in  a perfunctory manner  in a post-trial\nmemorandum.  It  is well  settled that \"arguments  made in  a\nperfunctory manner below are deemed waived on appeal.\"  World\n                                                             \nUniversity,  978 F.2d at 16.  Thus, we treat Plouffe's unjust\n          \nenrichment and quasi-contract arguments as waived.  Moreover,\neven if we were to reach these arguments on their merits, our\ndecision that Plouffe contracted with  New Pace, and not with\n                                                        \nthe Rosses,  would preclude  Plouffe from  recovering against\nthe  Rosses  on  theories  of unjust  enrichment  and  quasi-\ncontract.\n          Finally, to  the extent  that Plouffe raises  other\narguments on appeal (such as his insistence that the district\ncourt  should  have  levied  sanctions  and  entered  summary\njudgment in his  favor), they are meritless and  are rejected\nwithout further comment.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n",

The\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nRosses, however, denying personal liability,  moved to vacate\n\nthe  entry  of default  against  them.    A Magistrate  Judge\n\ngranted the motion to vacate, and the case went to trial.\n\n          The  sole  issue at  the  one-day  bench trial  was\n\nwhether the Rosses  should be held personally  liable for New\n\nPace's debt.  The evidence at trial  showed that New Pace had\n\nfailed  to observe  several corporate  formalities, including\n\nrecord-keeping and holding annual meetings.   The corporation\n\nhad, however, filed corporate income tax  returns, maintained\n\na separate corporate bank  account, and made all  payments to\n\nPlouffe from  the corporate account.   Moreover, the district\n\ncourt  found no bad faith or  misuse of the corporate form by\n\nthe Rosses.   Accordingly, it declined  Plouffe's entreaty to\n\ndisregard the  corporate form and hold  the Rosses personally\n\nliable  on  New Pace's  debt.   As  noted above,  Plouffe now\n\nargues  that the  district court  erred in  (1)  vacating the\n\nentry of default; (2) refusing to hold  the Rosses personally\n\nliable on the debt.  We address these arguments in turn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.

Our\n\nstandard  of review  on appeal is  deferential.   \"A district\n\ncourt's action on a motion to set aside a default lies within\n\nthe court's  sound discretion  and should be  overturned only\n\nfor abuse of that discretion.\"  Id.  Moreover, we are  guided\n                                   \n\nby  the  \"`philosophy  that  actions   should  ordinarily  be\n\nresolved on their merits.'\"   Id.

The  record\n\npresents  no  evidence  of  willful default  by  the  Rosses;\n\nPlouffe  failed  to articulate  any  prejudice;1  and, as  is\n\ndemonstrated more fully infra,  the Rosses' defense that they\n                             \n\nwere  not personally  liable for  the debts  of New  Pace was\n\nmeritorious.  Accordingly, we find no  abuse of discretion in\n\nthe Magistrate Judge's order vacating the entry of default.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  Both below  and on appeal, Plouffe  has insisted, without\nelaboration,  that he was  prejudiced by the  passage of time\nwhich  followed the  default.  We  agree with  the Magistrate\nJudge that, Plouffe's  insistence aside, the record  provides\nno evidence of prejudice due to the passage of time.\n\n2.  Plouffe  also argues that he  is entitled to  the cost of\npersonal service on New Pace and the Rosses because he served\nthem  once   by  mail,   received  no   acknowledgement,  and\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nB.  Piercing the Corporate Veil\n                               \n\n          Plouffe's second ground for appeal fares no better.\n\nRelying almost exclusively on  the Rosses' failure to observe\n\ncorporate formalities, Plouffe argues that the district court\n\nerred  in declining to pierce the corporate veil and hold the\n\nRosses personally liable on New Pace's debt.\n\n          Under  Massachusetts  law,3   while  disregard   of\n\ncorporate formalities is one  factor which courts consider in\n\ndetermining whether  to  disregard the  corporate  form,  see\n                                                             \n\nEvans  v.

Rather, courts examine a series of factors to \"form\n\nan opinion  whether  the  over-all  structure  and  operation\n\nmisleads.\"    Evans,  574  N.E.2d   at  400.    Of  paramount\n                   \n\nimportance is  the fact that, without  exception, \"[t]here is\n\npresent in the  cases which have looked through the corporate\n\nform  an  element of  dubious  manipulation  and contrivance,\n\nfinagling,  such that corporate  identities are  confused and\n\nthird  parties  cannot be  quite certain  with what  they are\n\ndealing.\"  Id.\n              \n\n          After hearing Bruce  Ross's testimony and reviewing\n\nall of the evidence at trial, the district court specifically\n\nfound no such dubious manipulation or contrivance on the part\n\nof  the  Rosses.4   We  find  nothing  to  suggest that  this\n\nfactual finding was erroneous.   \n\n           In addition, while the Rosses'  record-keeping was\n\nclearly  insufficient under  Massachusetts law, we  note that\n\nNew Pace met its corporate obligations at least to the extent\n\nthat it  (1) filed  corporate tax returns;  (2) maintained  a\n\nseparate  corporate  bank  account;   and  (3)  paid  Plouffe\n\nexclusively from this corporate account.  In sum, the  record\n\n                    \n\n4.  In its final order, the district stated: \"There is simply\nno doubt that the defendant, Mr. Ross, is not a conniver.

Plouffe also  argues that the Rosses  assumed or admitted\npersonal  liability on New Pace's debt when Bruce Ross sent a\nletter  to his  creditors,  including Plouffe,  promising  to\nrepay  his debts.    It is  well  established that  where  an\nindividual  assumes personal  responsibility for  a corporate\ndebt  due  to  a belief  that  s/he  is  morally, though  not\nlegally, inclined to do so,  such an agreement is  gratuitous\nand unenforceable  due to lack of consideration.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \nGishen  v.

To the  extent that  these\narguments were made to the district court, they were  offered\nfor  the first time in  a perfunctory manner  in a post-trial\nmemorandum.  It  is well  settled that \"arguments  made in  a\nperfunctory manner below are deemed waived on appeal.\"  World\n                                                             \nUniversity,  978 F.2d at 16.  Thus, we treat Plouffe's unjust\n          \nenrichment and quasi-contract arguments as waived.  Moreover,\neven if we were to reach these arguments on their merits, our\ndecision that Plouffe contracted with  New Pace, and not with\n                                                        \nthe Rosses,  would preclude  Plouffe from  recovering against\nthe  Rosses  on  theories  of unjust  enrichment  and  quasi-\ncontract.\n          Finally, to  the extent  that Plouffe raises  other\narguments on appeal (such as his insistence that the district\ncourt  should  have  levied  sanctions  and  entered  summary\njudgment in his  favor), they are meritless and  are rejected\nwithout further comment.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n</pre>",
