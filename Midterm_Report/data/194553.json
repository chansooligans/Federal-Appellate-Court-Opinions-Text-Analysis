The  mother and\n                                          \n\ngrandparents of two minor children brought this action in the\n\ndistrict court under 42 U.S.C.   1983 and state law against a\n\nsocial worker and two psychologists who were involved in  the\n\nState of New Hampshire's  investigation into reports that the\n\nchildren  had been  sexually abused.   The  two psychologists\n\nmoved to  dismiss the  complaint against themselves,  and the\n\ncourt  allowed their motion.  It ruled that they had absolute\n\nimmunity from suit under 42 U.S.C.   1983 and state statutory\n\nimmunity  from  the pendent  state  law claims.    We affirm,\n\nalthough on  somewhat  different grounds  as  to the     1983\n\nclaims.\n\n                              I.\n\n          In considering  a motion  to dismiss, a  court must\n\ntake the allegations in  the complaint as true and  must make\n\nall  reasonable  inferences  in  favor  of   the  plaintiffs.\n\nMonahan v.

Here the district court also took  into\n\naccount certain facts set  out in public documents plaintiffs\n\nattached to  an  opposition  they  filed  to  the  motion  to\n\ndismiss.    Ordinarily,  of   course,  any  consideration  of\n\ndocuments  not attached  to the  complaint, or  not expressly\n\nincorporated therein, is forbidden, unless the  proceeding is\n\nproperly converted  into one for summary  judgment under Rule\n\n56.

The facts that emerge\n\nare as follows:\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant   Valerie   Watterson  is   the\n\nnatural  mother  of two  minor girls  born  in 1979  and 1984\n\nrespectively  (\"the  older  child\"  and  \"the  young  child\";\n\ncollectively  \"the children\"  or  \"the girls\").    Plaintiff-\n\nappellant Violet  Bruillard is the natural  mother of Valerie\n\nand grandmother  of the  children.  Plaintiff-appellant  Paul\n\nBruillard  is Violet's  husband, and  stepgrandfather to  the\n\nchildren.  The  girls lived  with all three  appellants in  a\n\nhouse belonging to  Violet and  Paul in New  Hampshire.   The\n\ngirls' natural father, who separated from Valerie in 1981, is\n\nnot a party to this action.\n\n          Since birth,  the older child has  had only partial\n\n                             -4-\n\nhearing  and partial  speech abilities.   Beginning  in 1985,\n\nwhen  she was  six years  old, the  child attended  the Green\n\nAcres  School in  Manchester,  New Hampshire,  as  part of  a\n\nprogram for the  hearing impaired.   In January 1986,  school\n\nofficials reported unusual  behavior by the child  to the New\n\nHampshire Division  for Children  and Youth  Services (DCYS),\n\nincluding  symptoms of  neglect  and  possible sexual  abuse.\n\nDCYS  officials  investigated  the  case   and  identified  a\n\nfourteen-year-old  boy  who rode  to  school  on the  child's\n\nschool  bus  as the  probable abuser.    Steps were  taken to\n\nremedy the situation and the case was closed.\n\n          In  March  1987,  however, school  officials  again\n\nwrote to DCYS to report continuing symptoms of sexual  abuse.\n\nDefendant  Eileen Page  (who  is not  an  appellee), a  state\n\nsocial  worker assigned to the case by DCYS, filed a Petition\n\nfor Neglect in  the Pittsfield District  Court, State of  New\n\nHampshire, on  May 18, 1987.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-\n                                 \n\nC:7.  The petition  alleged that the older child  was subject\n\nto neglect by  Valerie Watterson, citing  the reports of  the\n\nGreen Acres  School officials  that the child  was describing\n\nsexual matters in  detail to other children  and her teacher,\n\nfondling herself and  other children,  and complaining  about\n\npains  in her stomach and  lower abdomen.   The petition also\n\nalleged that  the child wore  dirty clothing  to school,  was\n\nunkempt and unwashed, and appeared to be making her own lunch\n\n                             -5-\n\nof mayonnaise sandwiches.\n\n          On May  28,  1987, the  Pittsfield  District  Court\n\nconducted a  preliminary hearing and ordered  that the child,\n\nthen eight years of age, be referred to Concord Psychological\n\nAssociates  for counseling.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-\n                                \n\nC:15,  16.  The court  also granted legal  supervision of the\n\nchild  to  DCYS, left  placement  of the  child  with Valerie\n\nWatterson,  and  ordered DCYS  to  facilitate  the counseling\n\nsessions  and  \"to   conduct  an  appropriate  investigation,\n\nincluding,  but  not  limited  to  home  environment  study.\"\n\nBeginning June 11, 1987, the child attended weekly counseling\n\nsessions at Concord  Psychological Associates with defendant-\n\nappellee  Janet  Seymour,  a  psychologist who  was  not  yet\n\ncertified.    Seymour  was  supervised  by defendant-appellee\n\nRoland Smith, a board-certified psychologist  and director of\n\nConcord Psychological Associates.\n\n          On  June 22,  in lieu  of a  scheduled adjudicatory\n\nhearing and  without a finding of neglect, DCYS and appellant\n\nValerie  Watterson entered  an  agreement for  issuance of  a\n\nconsent  order.  See  N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.    169-C:17.  The\n                    \n\nconsent  order mandated  that,  \"[The  child] shall  continue\n\ncounselling  at  Concord  Psychological  Associates,  with  a\n\nreport from Concord Psychological Associates filed  with this\n\ncourt  not later than forty-five  days from the  date of this\n\nagreement.\"   The order  also stated  that DCYS would  assist\n\n                             -6-\n\nValerie in transporting the child to the counseling sessions,\n\nthat  Valerie would submit  to psychological evaluation, that\n\nDCYS would complete a  home study with Valerie's cooperation,\n\nand that the court retained jurisdiction over the case.  \n\n          Seymour with the aid of a sign-language interpreter\n\nconducted a  total of  seven psychotherapy sessions  with the\n\nchild   from  June  11  to  July  22,  1987.    On  Seymour's\n\ninitiative,  the younger  child, then  three years  old, also\n\nattended  one of  the sessions.   On  July 24,  1987, Seymour\n\nreported  her  findings in  writing  to  social worker  Page,\n\nstating that the older child revealed during therapy that her\n\ngrandmother  and  mother  (appellants  Violet  Bruillard  and\n\nValerie Watterson)  repeatedly took  the girls  against their\n\nwill to a  house where the older child was  required to sleep\n\nin  close  proximity with  boys  and a  grown  man.   On  one\n\noccasion, one male  allegedly fondled the  older child.   The\n\nyounger child was allegedly threatened with a large knife and\n\nsubjected  to fondling by a  young boy while  Valerie and the\n\nolder child watched.   The  older child  also reported  being\n\npaid for visiting  the house,  being told not  to reveal  the\n\nvisits to anyone, and eventually being informed by her mother\n\nin July  1987 (during the period of  the counseling sessions)\n\nthat she would no longer take the girls to the house.  \n\n          On the  basis of these  findings, Seymour concluded\n\nthat  the   girls'  grandmother,   Violet,   may  have   been\n\n                             -7-\n\n\"prostituting  [the  older  child]  and probably  [the  young\n\nchild]  to a  group of people,  likely a sex  ring.\"  Seymour\n\nstated that Valerie, the mother,  was only partially aware of\n\nthe  events at the house  but failed to  protect the children\n\nfrom the abuse.  Seymour concluded her report by recommending\n\nthat  DCYS  initially  confront Valerie  Watterson  with  the\n\naccusations  and then,  if necessary,  remove the  girls from\n\nappellants' home.\n\n          The same day Seymour issued her report, Page sought\n\nand obtained an ex  parte order from the  Pittsfield District\n                         \n\nCourt  for  the  immediate  removal  of  both  children  from\n\nappellants' home, citing the information gathered by Seymour.\n\nSee  N.H.  Rev.  Stat. Ann.     169-C:6.    That evening  law\n   \n\nenforcement  officials took  the two  girls from  appellants'\n\nhome and  placed them in separate foster  homes.  On July 27,\n\n1987, Page filed  new Abuse and Neglect Petitions with regard\n\nto the  two  children, alleging  that  they were  subject  to\n\nsexual abuse  by Valerie Watterson and Violet Bruillard.  See\n                                                             \n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:7.\n\n          On  September  24,  1987, in  connection  with  the\n\nproceedings,  Seymour swore  out an  affidavit detailing  her\n\nfindings  regarding  the two  children.    In her  affidavit,\n\nSeymour  attested  that she  believed,  based  on her  weekly\n\npsychotherapy sessions  with the  older child and  the single\n\nsession  with  the  young   child,  that  the  children  were\n\n                             -8-\n\nsubjected to some sort of  child prostitution/satanic worship\n\nactivity  (involving \"the killing  of animals  and children,\"\n\n\"ugly  hats (perhaps  headdresses) with  horns,\" and  \"men in\n\nrobes\"),  at  a location  identified  by the  girls  as \"Mike\n\nChickering's house.\"  Seymour's affidavit was apparently used\n\nby  the Merrimack County Sheriff's office  to obtain a search\n\nwarrant for the  Chickering house, where the only evidence of\n\nchild prostitution and satanic worship found by  police was a\n\ncatalog for pornographic films and an ordinary letter opener.\n\n          On May 25, 1988, after eight days of testimony, the\n\nPittsfield  District Court  ruled that no  evidence supported\n\nthe  allegations  of ritual  sexual  abuse  occurring at  the\n\nChickering   residence  and  so  dismissed  those  particular\n\ncharges.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-C:18, 19.  However,\n             \n\nthe court stated that  it was \"obvious\" that the  older child\n\nhad been sexually  abused and that  the young child  suffered\n\nsome traumatic  incident that  could be classified  as abuse.\n\nValerie  Watterson and  Violet Bruillard appealed  the latter\n\nfindings  to the superior court,  see N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  \n                                     \n\n169-C:28, but DCYS voluntarily withdrew the Abuse and Neglect\n\nPetitions before further proceedings were conducted.1\n\n                    \n\n1.   The record does not  indicate reasons for the withdrawal\nof  the abuse petitions.  Nor does any document state whether\nand when the children were returned to appellants, indicating\nthat there may have been subsequent proceedings regarding the\nchildren not  at issue here.   Appellants' brief  states only\nthat the younger child  remained in foster homes for  a total\nof two-and-one-half years, and that the older child currently\n\n                             -9-\n\n          Appellants brought this  civil action  on July  12,\n\n1990, in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nNew Hampshire  against DCYS social worker  Page and appellees\n\nSeymour   and  Smith  of  Concord  Psychological  Associates.\n\nAppellants alleged  in their complaint, as  amended, that all\n\nthree defendants were liable pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1983 for\n\ndepriving appellants  of their  liberty and  property without\n\ndue  process of law.   The complaint  contained pendent state\n\nlaw  claims against Seymour and Smith for failing to act with\n\ndue care with regard to professional  standards.  The amended\n\ncomplaint  also  brought   state  law  claims   of  malicious\n\nprosecution and abuse of  process against defendant Page, who\n\nis not a party to this appeal.2\n\n          Seymour  and  Smith  moved to  dismiss  all  claims\n\nagainst them under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on grounds that they\n\nare immune from  civil liability.  The district court granted\n\nthese  motions  on  August  12, 1991,  holding  that  the two\n\npsychologists had absolute quasi-judicial immunity from the  \n\n1983 claims as court-appointed  psychologists, and had  state\n\nstatutory immunity from liability  under the state law claims\n\n                    \n\nlives apart from appellants  in a residential learning center\nfor deaf children in Massachusetts.\n\n2.   The district court assumed  that the claims of malicious\nprosecution and  abuse of  process also applied  to appellees\nSeymour  and Smith and held that  they had statutory immunity\nfrom  those claims.   However,  appellants clarify  on appeal\nthat those two state law claims apply only to defendant Page.\n\n                             -10-\n\npursuant to the New Hampshire Child Protection Act.  See N.H.\n                                                        \n\nRev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:31.  Appellants appeal from the final\n\njudgment dismissing  the complaint against  Seymour and Smith\n\nissued pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) on February 7, 1992.\n\n                             II.\n\n     A.  Section 1983 Claims\n                            \n\n          We  need  not  decide whether  the  district  court\n\ncorrectly   held  that  a   court-appointed  psychologist  is\n\nentitled to absolute immunity  from claims in connection with\n\nher duties as  a quasi-judicial  officer.   Compare Myers  v.\n                                                         \n\nMorris,  810  F.2d 1437,  1466-67  (8th  Cir.)

This is  a\n\ndifficult  and, in  this  circuit, novel  question, on  which\n\nthere is no conclusive authority.  See Frazier v. Bailey, 957\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  920,  931  n.12 (1st  Cir.  1992);  see  also Snell  v.\n                                                         \n\nTunnell,  920 F.2d  673, 686-89  (10th Cir.  1990) (reviewing\n       \n\nvarious court positions on  absolute immunity for child abuse\n\ninvestigation participants),  cert. denied,  111 S.  Ct. 1622\n                                          \n\n(1991).   In  Burns  v. Reed,  111 S.  Ct.  1934 (1991),  the\n                            \n\nSupreme  Court  cautioned  that  the  \"presumption   is  that\n\nqualified  rather than  absolute  immunity is  sufficient  to\n\nprotect   government  officials  in  the  exercise  of  their\n\n                             -11-\n\nduties.\"   Id. at 1939.  The Court went on to say that it had\n              \n\nbeen  \"'quite  sparing'  in  [its]  recognition  of  absolute\n\nimmunity, and  [had] refused to  extend it any  'further than\n\nits  justification would warrant.'\"  Id. (citations omitted).\n                                        \n\nWe  do not suggest that absolute immunity could not exist for\n\nthese psychologists in the  present circumstances.  But since\n\nfor more conventional reasons  appellees are clearly entitled\n\nto  prevail,  we  rest  our  decision  exclusively  on  those\n\nreasons.\n\n          Except perhaps for the allegation that Seymour gave\n\nfalse testimony in court, appellants have alluded to no facts\n\nthat seem even remotely sufficient to show a violation of the\n\nfederal  constitution by  the  two psychologists.   And  even\n\nassuming  Seymour testified  falsely, and  even assuming  her\n\nfalse  testimony might  otherwise  give rise  to  a claim  of\n\nconstitutional dimensions,  she  would still  be immune  from\n\nsuit under   1983 because  of the absolute immunity  afforded\n\nto witnesses  for their testimony  in the course  of judicial\n\nproceedings.  Infra.  We, therefore, sustain the dismissal of\n                   \n\nthe   1983 claims.3\n\n                    \n\n3.  In  moving to  dismiss,  appellees relied  exclusively on\ntheir argument  that  the court-appointed  psychologists  had\nquasi-judicial  immunity for all their challenged activities,\nalthough  they reserved  the  right to  raise other  defenses\nincluding the failure  to state  a claim for  relief.   While\nissues not pursued in the district  court ordinarily will not\nbe  considered on appeal, Brown v.  Trustees of Boston Univ.,\n                                                            \n891 F.2d 337, 352 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937\n                                               \n(1990), we are free to affirm on any independently sufficient\n\n                             -12-\n\n          To bring an action  under   1983, a  plaintiff must\n\nshow  both  the  existence  of a  federal  constitutional  or\n\nstatutory  right, and  some deprivation  of that  right as  a\n\nresult  of  defendants' actions  under  color  of state  law.\n\nWillhauck  v. Halpin,  953  F.2d 689,  703  (1st Cir.  1991).\n                    \n\nAppellants claim that Seymour and Smith acted under  color of\n\nstate law to deprive  them of their  right to due process  of\n\nlaw  in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  We\n\nshall  assume that  the Pittsfield  District Court  order for\n\ncounseling  and reporting by Concord Psychological Associates\n\nprovided a  sufficient basis for these  private defendants to\n\nbe acting under color of state law.  See Frazier, 957 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n928;  Rodriques v.

This is especially  so where  our review is  de\n                                                             \nnovo.    Willhauck v.

Appellants have\nexplained their theory of  the case in the course  of arguing\nagainst  absolute immunity  for appellees,  and  described at\noral  argument   the   basis  for   their   federal   claims.\nFurthermore, we  take all of appellants'  allegations as true\nand make  our determination solely  as a matter of  law.  Cf.\n                                                             \nBrown  v.

To send\nthe  matter back to  the lower court would  be an exercise in\nfutility,   especially  given   the  additional   defense  of\nqualified immunity which, although not discussed here, stands\nas a further, seemingly insurmountable barrier to recovery.\n\n                             -13-\n\n1991).    A  likely  alternative  ground  for  affirming  the\n\ndistrict court  is qualified immunity.   However, before even\n\nreaching  qualified   immunity,  a  court   of  appeals  must\n\nascertain whether the appellants have asserted a violation of\n\na constitutional right at all.  Siegert v.

See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-\n                                 \n\nC:1  et seq..  Instead,  they make a  substantive due process\n            \n\nclaim,  viz., that  by means  of Seymour's  report, appellees\n\ndeprived  them  of   a  constitutionally  protected   liberty\n                                                             \n\ninterest in family integrity, including the care, custody and\n\nsupervision of  the  children.4    Seymour is  said  to  have\n\n                    \n\n4.   We see no other  constitutionally protected interest  or\nright  at  stake.    Damage  to  reputation  alone  does  not\nconstitute a  violation of  a substantive due  process right.\nPaul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 713 (1976).  But cf. Petition of\n                                                             \nBagley, 128  N.H. 275, 284-85,  513 A.2d 331  (1986) (holding\n      \nthat officials'  determination that  child  abuse report  had\nfoundation  in  fact  and  recordation  in  central  registry\nimplicated plaintiffs' due process liberty interest under New\nHampshire constitution).  \n     In  addition, there  are no  allegations in  the amended\ncomplaint  to support  the  conclusory claim  that appellants\nwere deprived  of  some constitutionally  protected  property\n                                                             \ninterest, so we find the complaint fails to state a claim for\nunconstitutional deprivation  of property.  See  Fed. R. Civ.\n                                               \nP. 12(b)(6).   The  only property  interest affected  was, we\ninfer  from the  complaint's  allegations, the  loss of  some\nmoney and wages to attend the abuse proceedings and to pay an\nattorney  to represent  them,  neither of  which constitutes,\nstanding alone, an unconstitutional deprivation of property.\n\n                             -14-\n\nconspired with Page to conduct  an unauthorized investigation\n\nof  the  family's affairs  while  also  counseling the  older\n\nchild.   Seymour was  allegedly negligent in  her counseling,\n\nand  this negligent  counseling and  investigating supposedly\n\nled to incorrect conclusions about the involvement of Valerie\n\nand  Violet in  the  sexual  abuse  of  the  girls.5    These\n\nincorrect conclusions, contained in Seymour's report, enabled\n\nDCYS to obtain court approval for the removal of the children\n\nfrom appellants' home, thereby depriving appellants  of their\n\nconstitutionally   protected   liberty  interest   in  family\n\nintegrity.6    Appellee  Smith's  purported  liability  stems\n\nsolely from his allegedly  inadequate supervision of  Seymour\n\nat Concord Psychological Associates.\n\n          Taking all  of plaintiffs' allegations as  true, we\n\nsee  only three possible bases  for the    1983 claim against\n\nSeymour: first,  she  \"conspired\" with  Page  to  investigate\n\n                    \n\n5.  Appellants  do  not allege  the  absence  of grounds  for\nsuspecting abuse by someone.  They admit that, during  visits\nto  her father,  the  older child  witnessed repeated  sexual\nabuse of another child  in a manner nearly identical  to that\ndescribed  by  the  older child  to  Seymour.   In  addition,\nappellants admit that the older child was molested at age six\nby a fellow student during bus rides to school.\n\n6.   While the  scope and level  of constitutional protection\nfor the  liberty interests  of grandparents  probably differs\nfrom that for  parents' interests, compare  Moore v. City  of\n                                                             \nEast Cleveland, 431 U.S.  494, 500-06 (1977) with Stanley  v.\n                                                         \nIllinois, 405 U.S. 645,  651-52 (1972), appellants Violet and\n        \nPaul Bruillard,  as grandparents who resided  with the girls,\nhave  interests at  least  sufficient to  avoid dismissal  of\ntheir    1983 claims on grounds they have no constitutionally\nprotected right at stake.\n\n                             -15-\n\nappellants'   family  without  express  court  authority  and\n\ndirection  to do  so; second,  she negligently  counseled and\n\ninterviewed  the children;  and  third, she  presented  false\n\ntestimony and withheld information from the court.  The first\n\ntwo  theories fall  short,  however, of  stating any  federal\n\nconstitutional claim.  While the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nan   abstract   fundamental  liberty   interest   in  \"family\n\nintegrity,\"  the Court has  never found  that interest  to be\n\nabsolute or unqualified.   Frazier, 957 F.2d at 929-30.   The\n                                  \n\ngovernment  has  a  compelling  interest in  the  welfare  of\n\nchildren, and  the relationship between parent  and child may\n\nbe  investigated  and  terminated   by  the  state   provided\n\nconstitutionally  adequate procedures are followed.  Santosky\n                                                             \n\nv.  Kramer, 455  U.S. 745,  766, 769  (1982).   The right  to\n          \n\nfamily integrity clearly  does not  include a  constitutional\n\nright to  be  free  from child  abuse  investigations.    See\n                                                             \n\nStanley v.

If while  engaged in treating  the children  under\n\ncourt  direction, Seymour, in  conjunction with  Page, looked\n\ninto  whether the  children  had been  abused by  appellants,\n\nsuch a joint undertaking would not, without more, violate any\n\n                             -16-\n\nconstitutional  right  of appellants.7    The  second factual\n\nbasis,  that  Seymour  performed  the  therapy  sessions  and\n\nreported her findings with a lack of due care, at most states\n\na claim of negligence, which is insufficient to constitute  a\n\ndeprivation of  due process  of law.8   Daniels  v. Williams,\n                                                            \n\n474 U.S. 327, 332-34 (1986).\n\n          Appellants'   third    allegation,   that   Seymour\n\nconspired  with  Page  to  present  false  testimony  to  and\n\nwithhold material  evidence from the court  hearing the abuse\n\ncharges,  fails  for a  different  reason:  all witnesses  at\n\njudicial proceedings have  an absolute immunity  from damages\n\nliability based  on their testimony.   Briscoe v.  LaHue, 460\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n7.   Describing the  investigation by  Seymour and Page  as a\n\"conspiracy\"  adds nothing  to  the  charge; mere  conclusory\nallegations that  defendants \"conspired\" are not  enough in a\ncivil rights complaint to  turn otherwise lawful actions into\na valid claim of  unlawful conspiracy.  See Glaros  v. Perse,\n                                                            \n628 F.2d 679, 685 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n8.   Appellants allege without further explanation or factual\nsupport  in  their  complaint   that  Seymour  conducted  the\ncounseling sessions with reckless and callous indifference to\ntheir constitutional rights.  While reckless indifference, as\nopposed to mere  negligence, may be actionable  under   1983,\nsee Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, 898 F.2d 224, 227 (1st\n                                     \nCir. 1990), no  set of  facts alleged in  this complaint,  or\nreasonable  inferences therefrom, could  support a finding of\nmore than simple  lack of  due care.   It  was not  Seymour's\ncounseling  activities,  as   such,  moreover,  that  injured\nappellants.  It was Seymour's  report to Page, conveying  the\nstory of possible abuse by appellants.  Yet appellants  admit\nthat  the  older  child had  been  sexually  abused  by other\nunidentified persons, see supra note  5, and the only alleged\n                               \nproblems  with Seymour's report  were purported omissions and\nmisinterpretations  of  certain   facts.    Seymour  herself,\nmoreover,  recommended  that  DCYS  seek  the  cooperation of\nValerie Watterson before considering removal of the children.\n\n                             -17-\n\nU.S. 325, 326 (1983).   This immunity applies even  to public\n\nofficials  who knowingly give  false testimony.   Id. at 345.\n                                                     \n\nSeymour thus  had absolute  immunity for her  testimony, even\n\nassuming it was either false or incomplete.\n\n          The   1983  claim against Smith is  based solely on\n\nhis  actions as  the supervisor  of Seymour's  counseling and\n\ninvestigation.   Because  Seymour violated  no constitutional\n\nrights of appellants in  her counseling and investigation, we\n\nfind  even   less  basis  for  recovery   against  Smith  for\n\nsupervising her.  See Frazier, 957 F.2d at 931-32.  \n                             \n\n          For  these  reasons,  the     1983  claims  against\n\nSeymour and Smith were properly dismissed.\n\n     B.  State Law Claims\n                         \n\n          The district court held that the two psychologists,\n\nSeymour and  Smith, had immunity  from the  state law  claims\n\npursuant to a state statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:31,\n\nwhich immunizes persons who  report suspicions of child abuse\n\nto the proper state  authorities in good faith.9   Appellants\n\n                    \n\n9.   N.H. Rev.

The  injuries\n\nalleged in their complaint  are separation from the children,\n\ndamage to  their reputations, and various  forms of emotional\n\ndistress.  No  harm to  the children as  the result of  their\n\nbeing negligently counseled is  alleged, nor was suit brought\n\non  the   children's  behalf  to  complain   of  the  alleged\n\nmalpractice.    All  the  asserted harms  resulted  from  the\n\nstate's removal of the children.   Seymour's and Smith's sole\n\nconnection to that separation was Seymour's report to DCYS of\n\nher  suspicions that  the girls  were being  sexually abused.\n\nClearly, Seymour's report  of suspected abuse falls  squarely\n\nwithin  the meaning of \"a report pursuant to this chapter\" as\n\ndefined by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-C:31.  See Petition of\n                                                             \n\nBagley, 128  N.H. 275, 280, 513 A.2d 331 (1986) (interpreting\n      \n\nprovisions  of  the  N.H.   Child  Protection  Act).    While\n\nappellants contend that the  Abuse and Neglect Petition would\n\nnot have been filed but for the allegedly negligent manner in\n\nwhich Seymour  conducted the counseling sessions,  we find no\n\nsupport in New Hampshire law, nor was any cited, for removing\n\nthe immunity protection of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:31 if\n\nthe   report  is  the  product  of  negligently  administered\n\n                             -20-\n\npsychotherapy.  See State  v.

The  two psychologists\n\nmoved to  dismiss the  complaint against themselves,  and the\n\ncourt  allowed their motion.

P.\n\n12(b)(6).\").\n\n          Like  the  court  below,  therefore, we  treat  the\n\ndocuments submitted  by plaintiffs     the Abuse  and Neglect\n\nPetitions,  the Pittsfield  District Court  orders, defendant\n\nSeymour's written  report to  defendant  Page, and  Seymour's\n\naffidavit    as part of the pleadings.  The facts that emerge\n\nare as follows:\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant   Valerie   Watterson  is   the\n\nnatural  mother  of two  minor girls  born  in 1979  and 1984\n\nrespectively  (\"the  older  child\"  and  \"the  young  child\";\n\ncollectively  \"the children\"  or  \"the girls\").    Plaintiff-\n\nappellant Violet  Bruillard is the natural  mother of Valerie\n\nand grandmother  of the  children.  Plaintiff-appellant  Paul\n\nBruillard  is Violet's  husband, and  stepgrandfather to  the\n\nchildren.  The  girls lived  with all three  appellants in  a\n\nhouse belonging to  Violet and  Paul in New  Hampshire.   The\n\ngirls' natural father, who separated from Valerie in 1981, is\n\nnot a party to this action.\n\n          Since birth,  the older child has  had only partial\n\n                             -4-\n\nhearing  and partial  speech abilities.   Beginning  in 1985,\n\nwhen  she was  six years  old, the  child attended  the Green\n\nAcres  School in  Manchester,  New Hampshire,  as  part of  a\n\nprogram for the  hearing impaired.   In January 1986,  school\n\nofficials reported unusual  behavior by the child  to the New\n\nHampshire Division  for Children  and Youth  Services (DCYS),\n\nincluding  symptoms of  neglect  and  possible sexual  abuse.\n\nDCYS  officials  investigated  the  case   and  identified  a\n\nfourteen-year-old  boy  who rode  to  school  on the  child's\n\nschool  bus  as the  probable abuser.    Steps were  taken to\n\nremedy the situation and the case was closed.\n\n          In  March  1987,  however, school  officials  again\n\nwrote to DCYS to report continuing symptoms of sexual  abuse.\n\nDefendant  Eileen Page  (who  is not  an  appellee), a  state\n\nsocial  worker assigned to the case by DCYS, filed a Petition\n\nfor Neglect in  the Pittsfield District  Court, State of  New\n\nHampshire, on  May 18, 1987.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-\n                                 \n\nC:7.  The petition  alleged that the older child  was subject\n\nto neglect by  Valerie Watterson, citing  the reports of  the\n\nGreen Acres  School officials  that the child  was describing\n\nsexual matters in  detail to other children  and her teacher,\n\nfondling herself and  other children,  and complaining  about\n\npains  in her stomach and  lower abdomen.   The petition also\n\nalleged that  the child wore  dirty clothing  to school,  was\n\nunkempt and unwashed, and appeared to be making her own lunch\n\n                             -5-\n\nof mayonnaise sandwiches.\n\n          On May  28,  1987, the  Pittsfield  District  Court\n\nconducted a  preliminary hearing and ordered  that the child,\n\nthen eight years of age, be referred to Concord Psychological\n\nAssociates  for counseling.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-\n                                \n\nC:15,  16.  The court  also granted legal  supervision of the\n\nchild  to  DCYS, left  placement  of the  child  with Valerie\n\nWatterson,  and  ordered DCYS  to  facilitate  the counseling\n\nsessions  and  \"to   conduct  an  appropriate  investigation,\n\nincluding,  but  not  limited  to  home  environment  study.\"\n\nBeginning June 11, 1987, the child attended weekly counseling\n\nsessions at Concord  Psychological Associates with defendant-\n\nappellee  Janet  Seymour,  a  psychologist who  was  not  yet\n\ncertified.    Seymour  was  supervised  by defendant-appellee\n\nRoland Smith, a board-certified psychologist  and director of\n\nConcord Psychological Associates.\n\n          On  June 22,  in lieu  of a  scheduled adjudicatory\n\nhearing and  without a finding of neglect, DCYS and appellant\n\nValerie  Watterson entered  an  agreement for  issuance of  a\n\nconsent  order.  See  N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.    169-C:17.  The\n                    \n\nconsent  order mandated  that,  \"[The  child] shall  continue\n\ncounselling  at  Concord  Psychological  Associates,  with  a\n\nreport from Concord Psychological Associates filed  with this\n\ncourt  not later than forty-five  days from the  date of this\n\nagreement.\"   The order  also stated  that DCYS would  assist\n\n                             -6-\n\nValerie in transporting the child to the counseling sessions,\n\nthat  Valerie would submit  to psychological evaluation, that\n\nDCYS would complete a  home study with Valerie's cooperation,\n\nand that the court retained jurisdiction over the case.  \n\n          Seymour with the aid of a sign-language interpreter\n\nconducted a  total of  seven psychotherapy sessions  with the\n\nchild   from  June  11  to  July  22,  1987.    On  Seymour's\n\ninitiative,  the younger  child, then  three years  old, also\n\nattended  one of  the sessions.   On  July 24,  1987, Seymour\n\nreported  her  findings in  writing  to  social worker  Page,\n\nstating that the older child revealed during therapy that her\n\ngrandmother  and  mother  (appellants  Violet  Bruillard  and\n\nValerie Watterson)  repeatedly took  the girls  against their\n\nwill to a  house where the older child was  required to sleep\n\nin  close  proximity with  boys  and a  grown  man.   On  one\n\noccasion, one male  allegedly fondled the  older child.   The\n\nyounger child was allegedly threatened with a large knife and\n\nsubjected  to fondling by a  young boy while  Valerie and the\n\nolder child watched.   The  older child  also reported  being\n\npaid for visiting  the house,  being told not  to reveal  the\n\nvisits to anyone, and eventually being informed by her mother\n\nin July  1987 (during the period of  the counseling sessions)\n\nthat she would no longer take the girls to the house.  \n\n          On the  basis of these  findings, Seymour concluded\n\nthat  the   girls'  grandmother,   Violet,   may  have   been\n\n                             -7-\n\n\"prostituting  [the  older  child]  and probably  [the  young\n\nchild]  to a  group of people,  likely a sex  ring.\"  Seymour\n\nstated that Valerie, the mother,  was only partially aware of\n\nthe  events at the house  but failed to  protect the children\n\nfrom the abuse.  Seymour concluded her report by recommending\n\nthat  DCYS  initially  confront Valerie  Watterson  with  the\n\naccusations  and then,  if necessary,  remove the  girls from\n\nappellants' home.\n\n          The same day Seymour issued her report, Page sought\n\nand obtained an ex  parte order from the  Pittsfield District\n                         \n\nCourt  for  the  immediate  removal  of  both  children  from\n\nappellants' home, citing the information gathered by Seymour.\n\nSee  N.H.  Rev.  Stat. Ann.     169-C:6.    That evening  law\n   \n\nenforcement  officials took  the two  girls from  appellants'\n\nhome and  placed them in separate foster  homes.  On July 27,\n\n1987, Page filed  new Abuse and Neglect Petitions with regard\n\nto the  two  children, alleging  that  they were  subject  to\n\nsexual abuse  by Valerie Watterson and Violet Bruillard.

Ann.   169-C:7.\n\n          On  September  24,  1987, in  connection  with  the\n\nproceedings,  Seymour swore  out an  affidavit detailing  her\n\nfindings  regarding  the two  children.    In her  affidavit,\n\nSeymour  attested  that she  believed,  based  on her  weekly\n\npsychotherapy sessions  with the  older child and  the single\n\nsession  with  the  young   child,  that  the  children  were\n\n                             -8-\n\nsubjected to some sort of  child prostitution/satanic worship\n\nactivity  (involving \"the killing  of animals  and children,\"\n\n\"ugly  hats (perhaps  headdresses) with  horns,\" and  \"men in\n\nrobes\"),  at  a location  identified  by the  girls  as \"Mike\n\nChickering's house.\"  Seymour's affidavit was apparently used\n\nby  the Merrimack County Sheriff's office  to obtain a search\n\nwarrant for the  Chickering house, where the only evidence of\n\nchild prostitution and satanic worship found by  police was a\n\ncatalog for pornographic films and an ordinary letter opener.\n\n          On May 25, 1988, after eight days of testimony, the\n\nPittsfield  District Court  ruled that no  evidence supported\n\nthe  allegations  of ritual  sexual  abuse  occurring at  the\n\nChickering   residence  and  so  dismissed  those  particular\n\ncharges.  See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-C:18, 19.  However,\n             \n\nthe court stated that  it was \"obvious\" that the  older child\n\nhad been sexually  abused and that  the young child  suffered\n\nsome traumatic  incident that  could be classified  as abuse.\n\nValerie  Watterson and  Violet Bruillard appealed  the latter\n\nfindings  to the superior court,  see N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  \n                                     \n\n169-C:28, but DCYS voluntarily withdrew the Abuse and Neglect\n\nPetitions before further proceedings were conducted.1\n\n                    \n\n1.   The record does not  indicate reasons for the withdrawal\nof  the abuse petitions.  Nor does any document state whether\nand when the children were returned to appellants, indicating\nthat there may have been subsequent proceedings regarding the\nchildren not  at issue here.   Appellants' brief  states only\nthat the younger child  remained in foster homes for  a total\nof two-and-one-half years, and that the older child currently\n\n                             -9-\n\n          Appellants brought this  civil action  on July  12,\n\n1990, in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nNew Hampshire  against DCYS social worker  Page and appellees\n\nSeymour   and  Smith  of  Concord  Psychological  Associates.\n\nAppellants alleged  in their complaint, as  amended, that all\n\nthree defendants were liable pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1983 for\n\ndepriving appellants  of their  liberty and  property without\n\ndue  process of law.   The complaint  contained pendent state\n\nlaw  claims against Seymour and Smith for failing to act with\n\ndue care with regard to professional  standards.  The amended\n\ncomplaint  also  brought   state  law  claims   of  malicious\n\nprosecution and abuse of  process against defendant Page, who\n\nis not a party to this appeal.2\n\n          Seymour  and  Smith  moved to  dismiss  all  claims\n\nagainst them under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on grounds that they\n\nare immune from  civil liability.  The district court granted\n\nthese  motions  on  August  12, 1991,  holding  that  the two\n\npsychologists had absolute quasi-judicial immunity from the  \n\n1983 claims as court-appointed  psychologists, and had  state\n\nstatutory immunity from liability  under the state law claims\n\n                    \n\nlives apart from appellants  in a residential learning center\nfor deaf children in Massachusetts.\n\n2.   The district court assumed  that the claims of malicious\nprosecution and  abuse of  process also applied  to appellees\nSeymour  and Smith and held that  they had statutory immunity\nfrom  those claims.   However,  appellants clarify  on appeal\nthat those two state law claims apply only to defendant Page.\n\n                             -10-\n\npursuant to the New Hampshire Child Protection Act.

Appellants appeal from the final\n\njudgment dismissing  the complaint against  Seymour and Smith\n\nissued pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

And  even\n\nassuming  Seymour testified  falsely, and  even assuming  her\n\nfalse  testimony might  otherwise  give rise  to  a claim  of\n\nconstitutional dimensions,  she  would still  be immune  from\n\nsuit under   1983 because  of the absolute immunity  afforded\n\nto witnesses  for their testimony  in the course  of judicial\n\nproceedings.

If while  engaged in treating  the children  under\n\ncourt  direction, Seymour, in  conjunction with  Page, looked\n\ninto  whether the  children  had been  abused by  appellants,\n\nsuch a joint undertaking would not, without more, violate any\n\n                             -16-\n\nconstitutional  right  of appellants.7    The  second factual\n\nbasis,  that  Seymour  performed  the  therapy  sessions  and\n\nreported her findings with a lack of due care, at most states\n\na claim of negligence, which is insufficient to constitute  a\n\ndeprivation of  due process  of law.8   Daniels  v.

Briscoe v.  LaHue, 460\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n7.   Describing the  investigation by  Seymour and Page  as a\n\"conspiracy\"  adds nothing  to  the  charge; mere  conclusory\nallegations that  defendants \"conspired\" are not  enough in a\ncivil rights complaint to  turn otherwise lawful actions into\na valid claim of  unlawful conspiracy.  See Glaros  v.

Appellants allege without further explanation or factual\nsupport  in  their  complaint   that  Seymour  conducted  the\ncounseling sessions with reckless and callous indifference to\ntheir constitutional rights.  While reckless indifference, as\nopposed to mere  negligence, may be actionable  under   1983,\nsee Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538368\"><a href=\"/opinion/538368/rafael-torres-ramirez-v-juan-bermudez-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1st\n                                     \nCir. 1990), no  set of  facts alleged in  this complaint,  or\nreasonable  inferences therefrom, could  support a finding of\nmore than simple  lack of  due care.   It  was not  Seymour's\ncounseling  activities,  as   such,  moreover,  that  injured\nappellants.  It was Seymour's  report to Page, conveying  the\nstory of possible abuse by appellants.  Yet appellants  admit\nthat  the  older  child had  been  sexually  abused  by other\nunidentified persons, see supra note  5, and the only alleged\n                               \nproblems  with Seymour's report  were purported omissions and\nmisinterpretations  of  certain   facts.    Seymour  herself,\nmoreover,  recommended  that  DCYS  seek  the  cooperation of\nValerie Watterson before considering removal of the children.\n\n                             -17-\n\nU.S. 325, 326 (1983).   This immunity applies even  to public\n\nofficials  who knowingly give  false testimony.   Id. at 345.\n                                                     \n\nSeymour thus  had absolute  immunity for her  testimony, even\n\nassuming it was either false or incomplete.\n\n          The   1983  claim against Smith is  based solely on\n\nhis  actions as  the supervisor  of Seymour's  counseling and\n\ninvestigation.   Because  Seymour violated  no constitutional\n\nrights of appellants in  her counseling and investigation, we\n\nfind  even   less  basis  for  recovery   against  Smith  for\n\nsupervising her.  See Frazier, 957 F.2d at 931-32.  \n                             \n\n          For  these  reasons,  the     1983  claims  against\n\nSeymour and Smith were properly dismissed.\n\n     B.  State Law Claims\n                         \n\n          The district court held that the two psychologists,\n\nSeymour and  Smith, had immunity  from the  state law  claims\n\npursuant to a state statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:31,\n\nwhich immunizes persons who  report suspicions of child abuse\n\nto the proper state  authorities in good faith.9   Appellants\n\n                    \n\n9.   N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:31 provides:\n\n          Anyone participating in good faith in the\n          making  of  a  report  pursuant  to  this\n          chapter  is  immune  from any  liability,\n          civil or criminal,  that might  otherwise\n          be  incurred  or   imposed.    Any   such\n          participant  has  the same  immunity with\n          respect    to   participation    in   any\n          investigation by the  bureau or  judicial\n          proceeding resulting from such report.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   169-C:29 requires that certain persons\n\n                             -18-\n\nargue that the district court misapplied the immunity statute\n\nbecause their  state law  claims against appellees  stem from\n\n                    \n\nreport suspected child abuse.\n\n          Any  physician,  surgeon, county  medical\n          examiner, psychiatrist, resident, intern,\n          dentist,      osteopath,     optometrist,\n          chiropractor,   psychologist,  therapist,\n          registered   nurse,  hospital   personnel\n          (engaged in administration,  examination,\n          care and treatment of persons), Christian\n          Science  practitioner,   teacher,  school\n          official, school nurse, school counselor,\n          social worker, day care worker, any other\n          child   or   foster   care  worker,   law\n          enforcement  official,  priest, minister,\n          or  rabbi  or  any  other  person  having\n          reason to  suspect that a child  has been\n          abused or neglected shall report the same\n          in accordance with this chapter.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.   169-C:30  describes how such  reports\nare to be made.\n\n          An  oral report shall be made immediately\n          by telephone or  otherwise, and  followed\n          within 48 hours  by a report in  writing,\n          if  so requested,  to the  bureau.   Such\n          report shall, if  known, contain the name\n          and address  of  the child  suspected  of\n          being  neglected or abused and the person\n          responsible for the child's  welfare, the\n          specific  information indicating  neglect\n          or the nature  and extent of the  child's\n          injuries   (including  any   evidence  of\n          previous injuries), the  identity of  the\n          person  or  persons  suspected  of  being\n          responsible  for  such neglect  or abuse,\n          and  any other information  that might be\n          helpful in establishing neglect  or abuse\n          or that may be required by the bureau.\n\n\"Bureau\" is defined as \"the bureau  of children, division for\nchildren and  youth services, department of  health and human\nservices.\"  N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.   169-C:3 IV.   This agency\nis referred to herein as DCYS.\n\n                             -19-\n\nthe  lack  of  due  care  in performance  of  the  counseling\n\nservices,  not from Seymour's  subsequent report of suspected\n\nchild abuse  (which, appellants concede, is  protected by the\n\nimmunity statute).\n\n          We  reject  appellants'  argument.    The  injuries\n\nalleged in their complaint  are separation from the children,\n\ndamage to  their reputations, and various  forms of emotional\n\ndistress.  No  harm to  the children as  the result of  their\n\nbeing negligently counseled is  alleged, nor was suit brought\n\non  the   children's  behalf  to  complain   of  the  alleged\n\nmalpractice.    All  the  asserted harms  resulted  from  the\n\nstate's removal of the children.   Seymour's and Smith's sole\n\nconnection to that separation was Seymour's report to DCYS of\n\nher  suspicions that  the girls  were being  sexually abused.\n\nClearly, Seymour's report  of suspected abuse falls  squarely\n\nwithin  the meaning of \"a report pursuant to this chapter\" as\n\ndefined by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    169-C:31.  See Petition of\n                                                             \n\nBagley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) (interpreting\n      \n\nprovisions  of  the  N.H.
