Plaintiffs  are a  group of\n                                   \n\nMaine employers who claim  that the defendant insurance companies\n\nillegally  conspired to  fix prices  and conduct  a boycott  in a\n\nsuccessful effort to coerce the state legislature into permitting\n\nhigher rates for workers'  compensation insurance.1  The district\n\ncourt  granted  summary  judgment  for defendants  based  on  the\n\ndoctrines established in  Parker v. Brown,  317 U.S. 341  (1943),\n                                         \n\nand Eastern  R.R. Presidents  Conference v. Noerr  Motor Freight,\n                                                                \n\n365  U.S. 127  (1961).2   The  court  concluded that  plaintiffs'\n\nclaimed damage -- the  additional cost of their insurance  -- was\n\nattributable  to  the  legislation  rather than  to  the  alleged\n\nconspiracy,  and  that,   consequently,  federal  antitrust  laws\n\nprovide no relief.\n\n     On appeal, plaintiffs contend that  the court erred both  in\n\nconstruing their  claims and in immunizing  defendants' actions. \n\nAfter carefully  reviewing the  record and pertinent  caselaw, we\n\nconclude  that  the  district  court   properly  granted  summary\n\njudgment for  defendants.  Although  we depart somewhat  from the\n\ncourt's  analysis   --  finding  that   the  alleged   conspiracy\n\nconstituted a  per se violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1\n                     \n\n                    \n\n     1  Plaintiffs  sued  fifteen  insurance  companies  and  the\nNational  Council on  Compensation Insurance (NCCI),  a voluntary\nassociation  of  insurers   that  is   a  state-licensed   rating\norganization.\n\n     2 In briefest summary, these doctrines exempt from antitrust\nliability  anticompetitive  actions  attributable  to  the state,\nParker, 317 U.S. at 350-52, and political activity by individuals\n      \nseeking to influence  the passage or enforcement  of laws, Noerr,\n                                                                \n365 U.S. at 136-40. \n\n--  we affirm the court's  holding that the  Parker doctrine bars\n                                                   \n\nplaintiffs' requested relief.3\n\n                               I.4\n\n     Workers'  compensation insurance has  long been an extremely\n\nsensitive issue in Maine.   Regulation is strict.   All employers\n\nwho do not self-insure  are required to purchase such  insurance.\n\nInsurers  are \"required by Maine  Law to charge  only those rates\n\nfor workers'  compensation insurance which have  been filed with,\n\nand  approved  by,  the  Maine  Superintendent  of  Insurance  in\n\nconformance with Maine Law.\"  Complt.    32.  The businesses  and\n\nthe insurers both have been dissatisfied with the system.\n\n     At  least  since  1981,  NCCI  and  its  members have  taken\n\naffirmative steps  to challenge  the allowable rates  as unfairly\n\nlow.    They  have  sought review  of  the  Superintendent's rate\n\ndecisions in  court, see, e.g., National  Council on Compensation\n                                                                 \n\nIns.  v.  Superintendent  of  Ins.,  481   A.2d  775  (Me.  1984)\n                                  \n\n(affirming  Superintendent's   disapproval  of  a  requested rate\n\nincrease  of 27.5%;  NCCI had  claimed that  statistical evidence\n\nshowed that a 110% increase was warranted), and consistently have\n\nlobbied for legislation that  would reduce statutory benefits and\n\npermit insurers to charge higher rates.  Neither their litigation\n\n                    \n\n     3  The complaint  sought  injunctive relief  in addition  to\ndamages, but neither the district  court nor the parties  devoted\nattention to  this request.  We  note only that, in  light of our\nanalysis,  we see no basis  upon which plaintiffs  may be awarded\ninjunctive relief.\n\n     4  We draw  heavily  from the  district court's  well-stated\ndescription  of   the  recent  history  of   the  Maine  workers'\ncompensation system.   \n\n                               -3-\n\nnor lobbying proved successful during the period relevant to this\n\nlitigation.\n\n     Indeed,  to  the contrary,  the  Maine  legislature in  1985\n\nenacted the \"Workers' Compensation Competitive Rating Act,\" which\n\ndirected  that workers'  compensation  insurance rates  be rolled\n\nback at least 8% and  frozen at that level until 1987.   Me. Rev.\n\nStat.  Ann. tit. 24-A,    2331-2357 (1985) (repealed).  Under the\n\nAct,  insurers were  prohibited  from  requesting rate  increases\n\nexceeding  10% in  1987, 1988  and  1989.   Id.  at    2355.   In\n                                               \n\naddition, the 1985 Act declared that it was intended, inter alia:\n                                                                \n\n     1.  . . . To prohibit price fixing agreements and other\n     anticompetitive behavior by insurers.\n     . . . \n     3.  . . . To promote price competition among insurers .\n     . . . \n\nId. at   2332.\n   \n\n     The insurers challenged the 1985 act in court.  Although the\n\nMaine Superior Court  determined that the  rate ceilings were  so\n\nlow that they were confiscatory, the court held that the ceilings\n\nwere not unconstitutional because  insurers were free to withdraw\n\nfrom  the market  for workers'  compensation insurance  in Maine.\n\nNational Council on Compensation  Ins. v. Superintendent of Ins.,\n                                                                \n\nCV-85-459  (Sup.  Ct.  May  14,  1987)  (Alexander,  J.),  appeal\n                                                                 \n\ndismissed, 538  A.2d 759  (Me. 1988)  (dismissed as moot  because\n         \n\n1987 legislation repealed 1985 Act).\n\n     In this lawsuit,  plaintiffs assert that defendants,  unable\n\nto  achieve  their goals  legally,  resorted  to improper  means.\n\nPlaintiffs  contend that  defendants  allegedly conspired  to fix\n\n                               -4-\n\nprices at a higher-than-lawful  rate and to conduct a  boycott of\n\nthe  Maine workers'  compensation  market  to induce  legislation\n\nauthorizing rate increases.  As early as 1986,  plaintiffs claim,\n\ndefendants   jointly   began   refusing   to   insure   employers\n\nvoluntarily,  requiring  them  to  obtain  workers'  compensation\n\ncoverage through  the \"residual\" or \"involuntary\"  system.  Every\n\ninsurer  authorized to  write workers'  compensation  policies in\n\nMaine is required by state law to participate in the \"involuntary\n\nmarket\" and,  thus, to share the  underwriting responsibility for\n\nemployers   otherwise   unable   to   obtain  coverage.5      The\n\nconspirators  allegedly  increased  the  pressure  on  the  Maine\n\nlegislature to  act when, between  late summer and  October 1987,\n\nvirtually all workers' compensation insurers in Maine prepared to\n\nwithdraw from the state.\n\n     To  avert the  crisis  that  would  occur  if  all  workers'\n\ncompensation  insurers left,  Governor John  McKernan convened  a\n\nspecial  session  of  the  legislature   devoted  exclusively  to\n\nreviewing and reforming Maine's workers' compensation system.  In\n\nshort order, the legislature approved the \"Workers'  Compensation\n\nRating Act\" (deleting the word \"competitive\" that had been in the\n\ntitle of the 1985 Act), Me. Rev. St. Ann. tit. 24-A,    2361-2374\n\n(West 1990 and 1992 Supp.).  The 1987 Act removed the limitations\n\non rate increases contained in the 1985 Act.  It authorized  NCCI\n\nto  act as agent for its member insurance companies by submitting\n\n                    \n\n     5 Plaintiffs  seem to suggest  that the  shift of  employers\nfrom  the voluntary  to the  involuntary market  was in  some way\ndetrimental to them, but they do not explain how.\n\n                               -5-\n\njoint  rate proposals  on their behalf  to the  Superintendent of\n\nInsurance,  who  is  the  ultimate  decisionmaker  on  the  rates\n\ninsurers may charge.  Insurers are permitted, however, to deviate\n\nbelow the rate approved by the Superintendent.\n\n     In 1988,  1989 and  1990, the insurers  collectively applied\n\nfor rates beyond the limits allowed  in the 1985 Act.  Each year,\n\nthe  Superintendent rejected  the requested  rate  increases, but\n\nauthorized lower increases  that still exceeded the 10%  caps set\n\nby the 1985 legislation.  Plaintiffs contend that, as part of the\n\ninsurers'   continuing    price-fixing   conspiracy,   defendants\n\nunlawfully agreed to charge only the maximum rates allowed by the\n\nSuperintendent.\n\n     Through this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek recovery of damages in\n\nthe amount of  the increased  premiums they have  paid since  the\n\n1987 Act was passed  and defendants began charging higher  rates.\n\nThe district court concluded that this  relief was barred because\n\nthe alleged harm  was directly traceable to the  1987 legislation\n\nand the approval of rate increases by the Maine Superintendent of\n\nInsurance.    The court  relied  on  the well-established  Parker\n                                                                 \n\nprinciple,  see  317  U.S.  at  350-52,  that  injury  caused  by\n               \n\nanticompetitive  state   action  is  not  compensable  under  the\n\nantitrust  laws.   The  court further  believed that  defendants'\n\nactions were protected  by the  Noerr doctrine, see  365 U.S.  at\n                                                   \n\n136-40,  which  exempts from  antitrust liability  the collective\n\nefforts of private actors to promote anticompetitive legislation.\n\n                               -6-\n\n     Plaintiffs  argue on  appeal that  the district  court erred\n\nbecause it  mistakenly attributed their asserted  injury to state\n\naction.     They  contend  that  they  were  harmed  not  by  the\n\nlegislation  itself  but  by  defendants'  ongoing conspiracy  to\n\nobtain  and  charge  higher  rates.    Parker,  they  insist,  is\n                                             \n\ntherefore inapplicable.  They  further assert that Noerr provides\n                                                        \n\nno  immunity   for  defendants  because  the  alleged  conspiracy\n\ninvolved classic  anticompetitive economic  conduct --  a boycott\n\nand  price-fixing  --  rather  than political  activity  such  as\n\nlobbying or petitioning.\n\n     Defendants  respond that,  regardless of  the nature  of the\n\nconspiracy,  which  they  admitted  solely for  purposes  of  the\n\nsummary judgment  proceedings, they  cannot  be assessed  damages\n\nbased  on the premium increases authorized by state law.  Because\n\nthat  is the  only  injury  for  which  plaintiffs  seek  relief,\n\ndefendants  maintain that  the district  court correctly  granted\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                               II.\n\n     The issues  we face on this  appeal are matters of  law, and\n\nour standard of review is therefore de novo.  Liberty Mutual Ins.\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v.  Commercial Union  Ins. Co., 978  F.2d 750, 757  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1992).  Although plaintiffs repeated at oral argument a complaint\n\nearlier made to the  district court that they had  had inadequate\n\ntime to develop the  facts through discovery, we  do not see  how\n\nadditional investigation could have affected the summary judgment\n\ndecision.    Defendants  have  admitted, for  purposes  of  their\n\n                               -7-\n\nmotion, that  they conspired to withdraw from  the Maine workers'\n\ncompensation  market.    Plaintiffs identify  no  other  possibly\n\ndiscoverable  fact that  would  be material  to the  legal issues\n\nbefore  us.  We note,  moreover, that they  have not appealed the\n\ndistrict court's denial of  their motion for additional discovery\n\ntime.\n\n     Plaintiffs  make a  related  claim that  the district  court\n\nerred  in repeatedly failing  to construe their  complaint in the\n\nlight  most favorable  to  them, arguing  that  this standard  of\n\nscrutiny -- normally applicable to motions to dismiss --  applies\n\nhere because defendants conceded the material factual allegations\n\nof  the  complaint.    This  claim  also  is  irrelevant  to  our\n\ndisposition.   As  our analysis  in the  following  sections will\n\ndemonstrate,  plaintiffs' appeal  fails no  matter  how liberally\n\ntheir allegations concerning defendants' conspiracy are construed\n\nbecause the  specific relief they seek  is barred as a  matter of\n\nlaw.  \n\n                               III.\n\n     We begin  our analysis with an  aspect of the case  that has\n\nengendered  some confusion,  but apparently no  real disagreement\n\namong the parties.   In the concluding paragraph of  its opinion,\n\nthe district  court stated that \"[t]he  defendants' conspiracy to\n\npress for legislation permitting them  to charge higher rates  --\n\nwhich  in and of itself caused Plaintiffs  no injury -- is immune\n\nunder Noerr.\"  Opinion at 22.  The State of  Maine construed this\n           \n\nstatement  and similar  references  elsewhere in  the opinion  as\n\n                               -8-\n\nholding  that  private actors  lawfully  may  employ a  concerted\n\neconomic  boycott  to  influence  a   legislative  determination.\n\nDisturbed  by this  specific  holding, the  State sought  and was\n\ngranted permission to file an amicus brief limited to urging that\n\nwe reverse the ruling.\n\n     We have  some doubt  that the  district  court intended  the\n\nbroad  statement attributed to it  by the State.   Regardless, at\n\nthis  point, the State's  position meets with  no opposition from\n\nany  party.   Plaintiffs and  defendants all  agree that  private\n\nactors who conduct  an economic boycott  violate the Sherman  Act\n\nand may be held responsible  for direct marketplace injury caused\n                                                          \n\nby  the  boycott, even  if the  boycotters'  ultimate goal  is to\n\nobtain  favorable  state action.    This view,  we  find, clearly\n\nreflects Supreme Court precedent.\n\n     In  Noerr,  the  Supreme   Court  held  that  the  defendant\n              \n\nrailroads could associate for  the purpose of waging  a publicity\n\ncampaign  designed to  secure legislative  action harmful  to the\n\ntruckers with whom they competed, without implicating the Sherman\n\nAct prohibition against combinations in restraint of trade.   365\n\nU.S. at 136-37.   The  Court observed that,  in a  representative\n\ndemocracy, individuals  must have  the ability to  \"freely inform\n\nthe  government  of  their wishes,\"  id.  at  137,  and they  are\n                                        \n\npermitted   to  do  so   even  if  their   motives  are  entirely\n\nanticompetitive,  id. at  139-40.   Any  other conclusion  \"would\n                     \n\nimpute to the  Sherman Act  a purpose to  regulate, not  business\n\nactivity, but political  activity, a purpose which would  have no\n\n                               -9-\n\nbasis whatever in the  legislative history of  the Act.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n137.\n\n     Noerr does not  protect from  antitrust liability,  however,\n          \n\nall actions designed to influence government.

The  Supreme  Court   held  that  the  boycott\n\nconstituted  a \"plain violation of  the antitrust laws,\" 493 U.S.\n\nat 428, and that \"[o]ur decision in Noerr in no way detracts from\n                                         \n\nthis  conclusion,\" id.  at  424.

Opinion  at 20-21.  The court appeared  to view the\n\ngovernment's role  as a purchaser  as significant to  the Supreme\n\nCourt's conclusion that Noerr immunity was unavailable:\n                             \n\n     The  goal  of  the  trial lawyers'  conspiracy  was  to\n     inflict economic pain on  the government, forcing it to\n     pass  legislation.     In  this   case,  however,   the\n     Defendants' alleged conspiracy was not intended to harm\n     the government  as  a  commercial  participant  in  the\n     marketplace, only to prompt it  to pass anticompetitive\n     legislation.\n\nOpinion at 21.   Consequently, the district court seemed  to say,\n\nthe conspiracy in this case was protected by Noerr.\n                                                  \n\n     Trial  Lawyers does  not establish  a \"government-as-market-\n                   \n\nparticipant\" exception to Noerr.   What was significant about the\n                               \n\nconcerted activity  there was  not  that the  government was  the\n\npurchaser, but  that the defendants  had sought to  influence the\n\ngovernment through an economic boycott that directly affected the\n\nmarketplace by,  inter alia,  constricting the supply  of lawyers\n                           \n\navailable to  represent indigent criminal defendants.   The Court\n\nemphasized  that  Noerr   provides  immunity  when  the   alleged\n                       \n\nrestraint of trade is  imposed by the government as  the intended\n                                                \n\nconsequence  of  the  defendants'  concerted  activity.    It  is\n           \n\n                               -11-\n\ninapplicable when private actors  impose the challenged restraint\n\nof  trade  through  a  boycott or  other  traditionally  unlawful\n\neconomic  measure, even  when  the boycott's  sole purpose  is to\n\ninstigate favorable governmental action.\n\n     Whether  the  boycotted purchaser  is  the  government or  a\n\nprivate individual  is  irrelevant;  the  significant  factor  is\n\ndirect market effect.\n\n     The restraint  of trade that was  implemented while the\n     boycott  lasted  would  have  had  precisely  the  same\n     anticompetitive consequences during that period even if\n     no legislation had been enacted.  In Noerr, the desired\n                                               \n     legislation  would  have created  the restraint  on the\n     truckers'  competition;  in  this  case  the  emergency\n     legislative response to  the boycott put an  end to the\n     restraint.\n\nTrial Lawyers, 493 U.S. at 425.\n             \n\n     Here,  too,  the defendants  allegedly employed  an economic\n\nboycott that  beyond doubt  \"`constituted a classic  restraint of\n\ntrade within the  meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act,'\" id.,\n                                                                \n\n493 U.S. at  422 (quoting  Court of  Appeals, 856  F.2d 226,  234\n\n(1988)).  Had  these or other plaintiffs sought injunctive relief\n\nduring  the boycott period, or  had they sought  damages based on\n\nthe boycott's direct market effects (such as reduced availability\n\nof insurance or higher  prices resulting from reduced competition\n\nduring  the  boycott  period),  they  would  have  had  a  viable\n\nantitrust  claim.   These  plaintiffs, however,  explicitly  have\n\ndisclaimed any request for relief based on injury occurring while\n\n                               -12-\n\nthe boycott was in place, before the Maine Legislature passed the\n\n1987 Act.6\n\n     In all likelihood, it was the plaintiffs' decision to pursue\n\nonly post-legislation damages that influenced the  district court\n\nto state broadly that defendants were immune from liability.  The\n\ncourt  correctly  recognized  that  a  conspiracy  to  press  for\n\nlegislation  permitting  defendants  to charge  higher  rates was\n\npermissible unless it was implemented through an actual restraint\n\non trade.   Because  plaintiffs sought  no direct  market damages\n\nfrom  the boycott, the court evidently treated the boycott not as\n\na  prohibited  restraint  of  trade  but  as  a  lobbying  effort\n\nequivalent  to the  unethical  and deceptive  publicity  campaign\n\nwaged by the defendants in Noerr.\n                                \n\n     In so  doing,  the court  may  have overstated  its  holding\n\nunintentionally, permitting the inference drawn by the government\n\nthat the boycott itself was being held immune under Noerr.  As we\n                                                         \n\nhave  explained, such a holding would conflict with Supreme Court\n\ncaselaw.    Defendants'  boycott  plainly constituted  a  per  se\n                                                                 \n\nviolation  of  the Sherman  Act  even though  plaintiffs  seek no\n\nmarketplace damages resulting from it.\n\n                               IV.\n\n     The  central  issue  before  us is  whether  plaintiffs  may\n\nrecover  damages based  on the  higher rates  they have  paid for\n\nworkers'  compensation  insurance  since  enactment of  the  1987\n\n                    \n\n     6 We offer no view as to whether plaintiffs would  have been\nable to prove damages from a constriction of supply or absence of\nprice competition resulting from the conspiracy.\n\n                               -13-\n\nlegislation.   The district  court  ruled that  the state  action\n\ndoctrine  of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, precluded such relief\n                            \n\nbecause  the   rate  increases  were  authorized   by  the  Maine\n\nLegislature,   and  adopted  and   implemented  by   the  state's\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance.\n\n     In Parker, \"[r]elying on  principles of federalism and state\n              \n\nsovereignty, [the Supreme  Court] held that  the Sherman Act  did\n\nnot apply to anticompetitive restraints imposed by the States `as\n\nan  act  of  government.'\"   City  of  Columbia  v. Omni  Outdoor\n                                                                 \n\nAdvertising, Inc., 111 S. Ct. 1344, 1349 (1991) (quoting  Parker,\n                                                                \n\n317 U.S. at 352).   The district court believed that  the actions\n\nof  the legislature  and  Superintendent of  Insurance superseded\n\ndefendants' previous conduct, rendering the rate hikes \"an act of\n\ngovernment\" immune  under Parker rather than  an injury inflicted\n                                \n\nby defendants' conspiracy. \n\n     Plaintiffs offer  two reasons  why the Parker  doctrine does\n                                                  \n\nnot bar the relief they seek.  First, in an argument more heavily\n\nutilized  in the  district  court, plaintiffs  maintain that  the\n\ndefendants'  use of  unlawful  activity to  coerce the  favorable\n\nlegislation makes the Parker  doctrine inapplicable.  Because the\n                            \n\nlegislature unlawfully  was pressured  to act, they  contend, the\n\nstatute   may   not  be   used   to   insulate  defendants   from\n\nresponsibility.   Second, plaintiffs  argue that  it was  not the\n\nlegislation simply  permitting rate  hikes that harmed  them, but\n\nthe defendants'  longstanding  conspiracy to  charge the  maximum\n\npossible rates.\n\n                               -14-\n\n     Neither  of  these  arguments  is  persuasive.    The  first\n\ncontention,  that the defendants'  coercive conduct circumscribes\n\nthe effect of the legislature's actions, is directly contradicted\n\nby  Supreme Court precedent.  In a  recent case, Omni, 111 S.

Ronwin, 466  U.S. 558, 579-80\n                                          \n\n(1984)).\n\n     Omni rejected a proposed  conspiracy exception to the Parker\n                                                                 \n\ndoctrine  that  would   have  denied  immunity  when   government\n\nemployees were  involved as  conspirators with private  actors in\n\nthe challenged restraint of trade.  The Court considered possible\n\nmethods   for  defining  a  conspiracy  exception,  including  an\n\napproach  that  would  make   Parker  inapplicable  only  if,  in\n                                    \n\nconnection with  the governmental action in  question, bribery or\n\nsome other  violation of state  or federal law  were established.\n\nId.  at 1353.  It  ultimately concluded that  any such limitation\n   \n\nwould  be,  at   best,  an  imprecise  way  to   determine  which\n\nanticompetitive state  actions should be  exempted from antitrust\n\nliability.\n\n     Such unlawful activity has no necessary relationship to\n     whether  the  governmental  action  is  in  the  public\n     interest.   A mayor is guilty of accepting a bribe even\n     if  he  would and  should  have  taken,  in the  public\n     interest, the same action for which the bribe was paid.\n\n                               -15-\n\n     . . . To  use unlawful political influence as  the test\n     of legality of  state regulation undoubtedly vindicates\n     (in a rather blunt  way) principles of good government.\n     But the statute  we are construing  is not directed  to\n     that end.\n\nId.\n   \n\n     The  holding in  Omni  fully embraces  plaintiffs'  tendered\n                          \n\ncoercion  exception.   Allegations  of  coercion,  like those  of\n\nconspiracy,   implicate  only   the  off-limits   issue   of  the\n\nlegislators' motivation.   Omni  reaffirms that the  state action\n                               \n\nprotection provided by Parker is not vulnerable to such claims.\n                             \n\n      Plaintiffs' second  theory bears  down more closely  on the\n\n1987  legislation.   Because the  statute does  not mandate  that\n                                                           \n\ninsurers charge the maximum  rates allowed by the Superintendent,\n\nbut  merely eliminated the caps imposed by the repealed 1985 Act,\n\nplaintiffs maintain  that  the higher  rates by  which they  were\n\ndamaged  resulted  from  defendants'  conspiracy  to  charge  the\n\nmaximum  rates  and not  from the  legislature's adoption  of the\n\nstatute.  We detect two problems with this argument.\n\n     First, the  manner in which plaintiffs  asserted this theory\n\nbefore the district court differed in a subtle, yet  significant,\n\nway  from  the  approach  adopted  on  appeal.    Throughout  the\n\nproceedings before the district court, plaintiffs emphasized that\n\nthey alleged injury from a conspiracy initiated in the summer and\n\nfall of 1987 to violate the 1985 legislation, which promoted open\n                                \n\ncompetition    in   the    workers'    compensation   market.    \n\n     Plaintiffs  do  not claim  that  they  were injured  by\n     actions  mandated by  the  1987  legislation.   Indeed,\n     plaintiffs allege  not only that  the conspiracy  began\n     before the 1987 legislation  was even enacted, but that\n\n                               -16-\n\n     the  objective   of  the   conspiracy  was   that  very\n                   \n     enactment.   Plaintiffs in  fact allege that  they were\n     injured by  defendants' conspiracy to violate  the 1985\n                                                            \n     legislation.    It is  therefore  the 1985  legislation\n     against which state action claims must be tested.\n\nPlaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants'  Joint Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, at 18 n.11 (emphasis in original).\n\n     At oral argument on  the summary judgment motion, plaintiffs\n\nagain  asserted that it had  been unlawful for  the defendants to\n\nconspire to increase prices  while the 1985 legislation governed.\n\nSee  App.  at  720.    When  the  district  court  asked why  the\n   \n\ndefendants' actions were not protected in light of their  \"acting\n\nwithin the framework set  up by the legislature in  the enactment\n\nof rates,\"  plaintiffs' counsel responded  that \"one needs  to be\n\nclear on the time frame.\"  Id. at 729.  He continued:\n                              \n\n     At the time the  conspiracy was hatched and effectuated\n     in summer and fall of 1987, the policy of the  State of\n     Maine  was  open competition  in  workers'  comp.   The\n     policy of the State of Maine was, \"Go compete with each\n     other.\"\n\n          And these defendants  had a private agreement,  in\n     effect, not to compete and to boycott consumers and the\n     state.\n\nId.\n   \n\n     Thus, the argument to the  district court focused on conduct\n\nleading  up to the 1987 act:  the defendants unlawfully conspired\n\nto  charge higher rates, and obtained permission to do so through\n\nunlawful  means,  making  the  new  rates  wholly   a  result  of\n\ndefendants' unlawful conduct.   Moreover, the plaintiffs  argued,\n\neven though the specific  harm for which they sought  damages did\n\nnot  occur until  after  the law  was  changed and  higher  rates\n\n                               -17-\n\nauthorized, defendants  had to be held responsible  so that their\n\npast  illegal  conduct  would  not  be  immunized  retroactively.\n\nFailing to hold them liable, plaintiffs argued,\n\n     would  lead to the  anomalous result  that unsuccessful\n                                                            \n     boycotts  (i.e.  boycotts  which  do  not  successfully\n                    \n     coerce   governmental   action)   would  be   antitrust\n     violations, but that successful boycotts (i.e. boycotts\n                                                   \n     to which government succumbs in order to avoid chaos or\n     disaster) would be immunized.\n\nPlaintiffs'  Memorandum  in  Opposition,  at  35-36 (emphasis  in\n\noriginal) (footnote omitted).7\n\n     The argument on appeal  unquestionably adds a new dimension.\n\nPlaintiffs  now contend  that,  after passage  of  the 1987  act,\n\ndefendants again violated antitrust  laws by conspiring to refuse\n\nto  sell  below   the  new  maximum  rates  established   by  the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance.   That agreement is  not entitled to\n\nstate action immunity, plaintiffs suggest, because  the provision\n\nin  the 1987  Act  allowing independent  ratesetting demonstrates\n\nthat  state  policy  still  favors  competition.    Consequently,\n\nplaintiffs contend that  defendants should be held liable for the\n\nrate increases.8\n\n                    \n\n     7  As we  made clear in  Section III,  the response  to this\nargument is that unlawful boycotts with direct marketplace impact\nwill result  in accountability for the  market injury, regardless\n                                              \nof their success in inducing governmental action.\n\n     8 We note that some  portions of plaintiffs' appellate brief\nretain the focus on the 1985 legislation:\n\n     Plaintiffs   do   not    challenge   the    Defendants'\n     \"participation  in  ratesetting  proceedings\"  in  1988\n     after  the 1987 legislation  was enacted  repealing the\n     1985 Competitive Rating Act.  What Plaintiffs challenge\n     is  Defendants' conspiracy begun in 1986 and 1987, at a\n                               \n     time   when  Maine  law  specifically  prohibited  such\n\n                               -18-\n\n     This link between plaintiffs'  conspiracy allegation and the\n\n1987  Act never  was offered  to the  district court;  indeed, as\n\nnoted above, plaintiffs  expressly disclaimed  the new  statute's\n\nrelevance to the  Parker issue.  The conspiracy achieved success,\n                        \n\nplaintiffs  asserted, when  the  State enacted  the law  allowing\n\nhigher  premiums.    See  Memorandum  in  Opposition  to  Summary\n                        \n\nJudgment, at 2-3 (quoted in  District Court Opinion, at 3).   Led\n\nby these  arguments, the district court  never considered whether\n\nthe defendants could be held responsible for the rate increases -\n\n- despite authorization  of those rates by  the state --  if they\n\nhad conspired not to deviate below the maximum rate.\n\n     Whether plaintiffs sufficiently preserved this argument need\n\nnot unduly detain us, however, because the theory is in any event\n\nunavailing.   When the  legislature enacted the  1987 statute, it\n\ndid not simply eliminate the ceiling on the permissible rates for\n\nworkers' compensation insurance, but it also  moved away from the\n\nstate's previous pro-competitive policy toward  ratesetting.  The\n\n1987 Act  provided for joint rate  filings9 and, in  our view, it\n\n                    \n\n     conspiracies, to  constrict supply, to fix  prices, and\n     to boycott consumers in order  to coerce the removal of\n                                                            \n     the existing price ceiling.\n                               \n\nPlaintiffs' Brief at 31 (additional emphasis added).\n\n     9 It did so  somewhat indirectly through repeal of  the 1985\nAct, which meant that the  joint ratemaking provisions that  then\nexisted  for  all lines  of insurance  sold  in Maine  again were\napplicable  to workers'  compensation  insurance.   In 1989,  the\nlegislature revised  the general  insurance ratemaking system  to\nencourage  competition, leaving  the joint  ratemaking provisions\napplicable only to the  workers' compensation providers.  Compare\n                                                                 \nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.  24-A,   2309 (West 1990) with  Me. Rev.\n                                                       \nStat. Ann. tit. 24-A,   2309 (West Supp. 1992).\n\n                               -19-\n\nmust  be construed  as  implicitly condoning  an agreement  among\n\ninsurers to  charge the  rates they  jointly propose,  subject to\n\napproval  by the  Superintendent.   When  insurers work  together\n\nwithin  a state regulatory system to advocate rates that they all\n\npresumably  believe  are  appropriate  for  workers' compensation\n\ninsurance, we  fail to see  how it could be  illegal price fixing\n\nfor them also subsequently  to agree to charge the  rates allowed\n\nby the state, particularly when the approved rates fall below the\n\njointly proposed rates.\n\n     At a  minimum, it  must be lawful  for insurers to  agree to\n\ncharge  the approved  rate where,  as here,  the Superintendent's\n\nobligation is to establish rates that are \"[j]ust and reasonable\"\n\nand \"[b]ased only  on a  just and reasonable  profit.\"  Me.  Rev.\n\nStat.  Ann. tit. 24-A,    2363 (7)(A)(1),  (2).   Thus, while the\n\nstatute  stipulates  that  these rates  set  the  upper  limit on\n\npermissible charges, id.  at   2362,  the expectation clearly  is\n                        \n\nthat  the Superintendent's rates are the ones that generally will\n\nbe appropriate  for, and  thus used  by, all insurers.   In  this\n\ncontext,  the legislature  evidently  viewed the  sort of  \"price\n\nfixing\" alleged by plaintiffs as  benign; notably absent from the\n\n1987 statute is a provision contained in the 1985 Act prohibiting\n\ninsurers from agreeing  \"to adhere  to or  use a  rate or  rating\n\nplan,\" id. at   2347 (2) (1985) (repealed).\n          \n\n     Plaintiffs  rely  on the  provision  allowing  downward rate\n\ndeviation to  support their claim that  defendants' conspiracy to\n\ncharge  a uniform  rate was  unauthorized and,  consequently, not\n\n                               -20-\n\nimmunized  under Parker.  But  the fact that  insurers may charge\n                                                          \n\nless than the approved  rate is of little significance when it is\n\njuxtaposed with  the uniform approach  to ratemaking that  is the\n\noverriding characteristic of  the reformed system.   On its  own,\n\nthe  permissive provision  certainly does  not establish  a state\n\npolicy favoring  competitive  pricing.    Moreover,  the  Supreme\n\nCourt,  in  Southern Motor  Carriers  Rate  Conference v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  471 U.S. 48 (1985), explicitly held that Parker immunity\n                                                        \n\nis  available to private parties  acting pursuant to  a regime of\n\ncollective ratemaking that  is authorized, though not  compelled,\n\nby the state.\n\n     Southern Motor  Carriers involved  a challenge to  the joint\n                             \n\nactivities of motor  common carrier rate  bureaus in four  states\n\nwhere carriers were permitted to  agree on rate proposals  before\n\ntheir  submission  to  state agencies.    In  the  course of  its\n\ndecision, the Court reaffirmed the two-pronged  test set forth in\n\nCalifornia Retail Liquor Dealers  Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n445   U.S.  97,   105   (1980),  for   determining  whether   the\n\nanticompetitive  conduct  of  private  parties  within  a   state\n\nregulatory scheme is shielded from the antitrust laws:\n\n     First, the challenged restraint  must be \"`one  clearly\n     articulated  and  affirmatively   expressed  as   state\n     policy.'\"   Second, the  State must  supervise actively\n     any private anticompetitive conduct.\n\n471 U.S. at 57 (citations omitted).\n\n     The  justices  then  considered  whether the  actions  of  a\n\nprivate party  can be attributed  to a clearly  articulated state\n\npolicy, within the meaning of the Midcal test's first prong, even\n                                        \n\n                               -21-\n\nif  the  state does  not  compel  the challenged  anticompetitive\n\nactivity.  Id. at  59-60.  The Court  observed that a  compulsion\n              \n\nrequirement would reduce the range of alternatives available to a\n\nstate  that  wished to  regulate  a  given  industry  --  thereby\n\nnegatively affecting  principles of federalism  -- while  perhaps\n\nalso causing greater restraints on trade -- thereby impairing the\n                    \n\ngoal of the antitrust  laws to ensure \"unfettered  competition in\n\nthe marketplace,\" id. at 61.  Declining to \"believe that Congress\n                     \n\nintended  to resolve  conflicts between  two competing  interests\n\n[federalism  and  competition]   by  impairing  both  more   than\n\nnecesssary,\" id., the  Court concluded that \"a  state policy that\n                \n\nexpressly permits,  but does not  compel, anticompetitive conduct\n                 \n\nmay  be `clearly articulated' within  the meaning of Midcal,\" id.\n                                                                 \n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n     In  this  case,  it  is manifestly  clear  that  defendants'\n\nratemaking activities meet both  prongs of the Midcal test.   The\n                                                     \n\nnew scheme was  adopted by the legislature, fulfilling  the state\n\npolicy prong of the test, and the Superintendent's involvement in\n\nreviewing    and   modifying   the   insurers'   proposed   rates\n\nunquestionably  meets  prong two's  requirement  of active  state\n\nsupervision.    Indeed,  plaintiffs  expressly  acknowledge  that\n\nMidcal is  satisfied with respect to  the ratemaking proceedings.\n      \n\nSee  Reply Brief,  at  19 n.15.    Plaintiffs instead  hammer  on\n   \n\ndefendants'   \"converting   the   results  of   that   ratemaking\n\nproceeding,  i.e. a schedule of maximum or ceiling prices, into a\n                                       \n\nprivate agreement to  uniformly charge the maximum price,  and to\n       \n\n                               -22-\n\nrefuse  to deal at  prices below that  level.\"  Id.  (emphasis in\n                                                   \n\noriginal).\n\n     This argument misfires because it fails to take into account\n\nthe  changed landscape.  Even  if defendants violated the Sherman\n\nAct in  the late summer and  early fall of 1987  by conspiring to\n\nraise the maximum prices they could charge beyond those permitted\n\nby  the 1985  Act, it  does not  necessarily  follow that  it was\n\nunlawful  for  them to  agree  to  charge  the rate  subsequently\n\napproved  by the Superintendent pursuant  to the 1987  Act.  Once\n\nthe legislature  acted in November 1987,  defendants' conduct had\n\nto be assessed in  light of the new state policy  and procedures.\n\nAs  we   have  discussed,  the  1987   Act  endorsed  cooperative\n\nratesetting and anticipated that most, if not all, insurers would\n\ncharge  the newly  authorized  rates.   Accordingly, the  damages\n\nsought  by  plaintiffs  --  the differential  between  the  rates\n\nallowed  under  the  1985  Act  and  the  new  rates  charged  by\n\ndefendants under the 1987 Act  -- must be viewed as a  product of\n\nstate action.   The district court  therefore correctly concluded\n\nthat, under Parker,  defendants may not  be held accountable  for\n                  \n\nthis claimed injury.\n\n                               V. \n\n     In summary,  we hold  that the  economic  boycott and  price\n\nfixing conspiracy allegedly conducted by defendants in the summer\n\nand  early fall  of 1987  constituted a per  se violation  of the\n                                               \n\n                               -23-\n\nSherman  Act,  and  did  not  fall  within  the  Noerr doctrine's\n                                                      \n\nprotection for  concerted activity  designed to  elicit favorable\n\nlegislation.   But plaintiffs have not  sought damages for direct\n\nmarketplace injury inflicted by that conspiracy.\n\n     The monetary damages alleged by plaintiffs --  the amount of\n\nincrease in their workers' compensation insurance rates under the\n\n1987 statutory scheme allegedly coerced by  defendants -- are not\n\nrecoverable  from the  insurers.   Because  the state  authorized\n\ncollective  ratemaking  and  closely supervised  the  setting  of\n\nhigher  rates,  any  agreement  among defendants  to  charge  the\n\nmaximum  authorized  rates  is  permissible,  and defendants  are\n\nimmune from liability for the increase under the Parker doctrine.\n                                                       \n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                               -24-\n",

As early as 1986,  plaintiffs claim,\n\ndefendants   jointly   began   refusing   to   insure   employers\n\nvoluntarily,  requiring  them  to  obtain  workers'  compensation\n\ncoverage through  the \"residual\" or \"involuntary\"  system.  Every\n\ninsurer  authorized to  write workers'  compensation  policies in\n\nMaine is required by state law to participate in the \"involuntary\n\nmarket\" and,  thus, to share the  underwriting responsibility for\n\nemployers   otherwise   unable   to   obtain  coverage.5      The\n\nconspirators  allegedly  increased  the  pressure  on  the  Maine\n\nlegislature to  act when, between  late summer and  October 1987,\n\nvirtually all workers' compensation insurers in Maine prepared to\n\nwithdraw from the state.\n\n     To  avert the  crisis  that  would  occur  if  all  workers'\n\ncompensation  insurers left,  Governor John  McKernan convened  a\n\nspecial  session  of  the  legislature   devoted  exclusively  to\n\nreviewing and reforming Maine's workers' compensation system.  In\n\nshort order, the legislature approved the \"Workers'  Compensation\n\nRating Act\" (deleting the word \"competitive\" that had been in the\n\ntitle of the 1985 Act), Me. Rev. St. Ann. tit. 24-A,    2361-2374\n\n(West 1990 and 1992 Supp.).  The 1987 Act removed the limitations\n\non rate increases contained in the 1985 Act.  It authorized  NCCI\n\nto  act as agent for its member insurance companies by submitting\n\n                    \n\n     5 Plaintiffs  seem to suggest  that the  shift of  employers\nfrom  the voluntary  to the  involuntary market  was in  some way\ndetrimental to them, but they do not explain how.\n\n                               -5-\n\njoint  rate proposals  on their behalf  to the  Superintendent of\n\nInsurance,  who  is  the  ultimate  decisionmaker  on  the  rates\n\ninsurers may charge.  Insurers are permitted, however, to deviate\n\nbelow the rate approved by the Superintendent.\n\n     In 1988,  1989 and  1990, the insurers  collectively applied\n\nfor rates beyond the limits allowed  in the 1985 Act.  Each year,\n\nthe  Superintendent rejected  the requested  rate  increases, but\n\nauthorized lower increases  that still exceeded the 10%  caps set\n\nby the 1985 legislation.  Plaintiffs contend that, as part of the\n\ninsurers'   continuing    price-fixing   conspiracy,   defendants\n\nunlawfully agreed to charge only the maximum rates allowed by the\n\nSuperintendent.\n\n     Through this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek recovery of damages in\n\nthe amount of  the increased  premiums they have  paid since  the\n\n1987 Act was passed  and defendants began charging higher  rates.\n\nThe district court concluded that this  relief was barred because\n\nthe alleged harm  was directly traceable to the  1987 legislation\n\nand the approval of rate increases by the Maine Superintendent of\n\nInsurance.    The court  relied  on  the well-established  Parker\n                                                                 \n\nprinciple,  see  317  U.S.  at  350-52,  that  injury  caused  by\n               \n\nanticompetitive  state   action  is  not  compensable  under  the\n\nantitrust  laws.   The  court further  believed that  defendants'\n\nactions were protected  by the  Noerr doctrine, see  365 U.S.  at\n                                                   \n\n136-40,  which  exempts from  antitrust liability  the collective\n\nefforts of private actors to promote anticompetitive legislation.\n\n                               -6-\n\n     Plaintiffs  argue on  appeal that  the district  court erred\n\nbecause it  mistakenly attributed their asserted  injury to state\n\naction.     They  contend  that  they  were  harmed  not  by  the\n\nlegislation  itself  but  by  defendants'  ongoing conspiracy  to\n\nobtain  and  charge  higher  rates.    Parker,  they  insist,  is\n                                             \n\ntherefore inapplicable.  They  further assert that Noerr provides\n                                                        \n\nno  immunity   for  defendants  because  the  alleged  conspiracy\n\ninvolved classic  anticompetitive economic  conduct --  a boycott\n\nand  price-fixing  --  rather  than political  activity  such  as\n\nlobbying or petitioning.\n\n     Defendants  respond that,  regardless of  the nature  of the\n\nconspiracy,  which  they  admitted  solely for  purposes  of  the\n\nsummary judgment  proceedings, they  cannot  be assessed  damages\n\nbased  on the premium increases authorized by state law.  Because\n\nthat  is the  only  injury  for  which  plaintiffs  seek  relief,\n\ndefendants  maintain that  the district  court correctly  granted\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                               II.\n\n     The issues  we face on this  appeal are matters of  law, and\n\nour standard of review is therefore de novo.

Although plaintiffs repeated at oral argument a complaint\n\nearlier made to the  district court that they had  had inadequate\n\ntime to develop the  facts through discovery, we  do not see  how\n\nadditional investigation could have affected the summary judgment\n\ndecision.    Defendants  have  admitted, for  purposes  of  their\n\n                               -7-\n\nmotion, that  they conspired to withdraw from  the Maine workers'\n\ncompensation  market.    Plaintiffs identify  no  other  possibly\n\ndiscoverable  fact that  would  be material  to the  legal issues\n\nbefore  us.  We note,  moreover, that they  have not appealed the\n\ndistrict court's denial of  their motion for additional discovery\n\ntime.\n\n     Plaintiffs  make a  related  claim that  the district  court\n\nerred  in repeatedly failing  to construe their  complaint in the\n\nlight  most favorable  to  them, arguing  that  this standard  of\n\nscrutiny -- normally applicable to motions to dismiss --  applies\n\nhere because defendants conceded the material factual allegations\n\nof  the  complaint.    This  claim  also  is  irrelevant  to  our\n\ndisposition.   As  our analysis  in the  following  sections will\n\ndemonstrate,  plaintiffs' appeal  fails no  matter  how liberally\n\ntheir allegations concerning defendants' conspiracy are construed\n\nbecause the  specific relief they seek  is barred as a  matter of\n\nlaw.  \n\n                               III.\n\n     We begin  our analysis with an  aspect of the case  that has\n\nengendered  some confusion,  but apparently no  real disagreement\n\namong the parties.   In the concluding paragraph of  its opinion,\n\nthe district  court stated that \"[t]he  defendants' conspiracy to\n\npress for legislation permitting them  to charge higher rates  --\n\nwhich  in and of itself caused Plaintiffs  no injury -- is immune\n\nunder Noerr.\"  Opinion at 22.  The State of  Maine construed this\n           \n\nstatement  and similar  references  elsewhere in  the opinion  as\n\n                               -8-\n\nholding  that  private actors  lawfully  may  employ a  concerted\n\neconomic  boycott  to  influence  a   legislative  determination.\n\nDisturbed  by this  specific  holding, the  State sought  and was\n\ngranted permission to file an amicus brief limited to urging that\n\nwe reverse the ruling.\n\n     We have  some doubt  that the  district  court intended  the\n\nbroad  statement attributed to it  by the State.   Regardless, at\n\nthis  point, the State's  position meets with  no opposition from\n\nany  party.   Plaintiffs and  defendants all  agree that  private\n\nactors who conduct  an economic boycott  violate the Sherman  Act\n\nand may be held responsible  for direct marketplace injury caused\n                                                          \n\nby  the  boycott, even  if the  boycotters'  ultimate goal  is to\n\nobtain  favorable  state action.    This view,  we  find, clearly\n\nreflects Supreme Court precedent.\n\n     In  Noerr,  the  Supreme   Court  held  that  the  defendant\n              \n\nrailroads could associate for  the purpose of waging  a publicity\n\ncampaign  designed to  secure legislative  action harmful  to the\n\ntruckers with whom they competed, without implicating the Sherman\n\nAct prohibition against combinations in restraint of trade.   365\n\nU.S. at 136-37.   The  Court observed that,  in a  representative\n\ndemocracy, individuals  must have  the ability to  \"freely inform\n\nthe  government  of  their wishes,\"  id.  at  137,  and they  are\n                                        \n\npermitted   to  do  so   even  if  their   motives  are  entirely\n\nanticompetitive,  id. at  139-40.   Any  other conclusion  \"would\n                     \n\nimpute to the  Sherman Act  a purpose to  regulate, not  business\n\nactivity, but political  activity, a purpose which would  have no\n\n                               -9-\n\nbasis whatever in the  legislative history of  the Act.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n137.\n\n     Noerr does not  protect from  antitrust liability,  however,\n          \n\nall actions designed to influence government.

In  this   case,  however,   the\n     Defendants' alleged conspiracy was not intended to harm\n     the government  as  a  commercial  participant  in  the\n     marketplace, only to prompt it  to pass anticompetitive\n     legislation.\n\nOpinion at 21.   Consequently, the district court seemed  to say,\n\nthe conspiracy in this case was protected by Noerr.\n                                                  \n\n     Trial  Lawyers does  not establish  a \"government-as-market-\n                   \n\nparticipant\" exception to Noerr.   What was significant about the\n                               \n\nconcerted activity  there was  not  that the  government was  the\n\npurchaser, but  that the defendants  had sought to  influence the\n\ngovernment through an economic boycott that directly affected the\n\nmarketplace by,  inter alia,  constricting the supply  of lawyers\n                           \n\navailable to  represent indigent criminal defendants.

The\n\ncourt  correctly  recognized  that  a  conspiracy  to  press  for\n\nlegislation  permitting  defendants  to charge  higher  rates was\n\npermissible unless it was implemented through an actual restraint\n\non trade.   Because  plaintiffs sought  no direct  market damages\n\nfrom  the boycott, the court evidently treated the boycott not as\n\na  prohibited  restraint  of  trade  but  as  a  lobbying  effort\n\nequivalent  to the  unethical  and deceptive  publicity  campaign\n\nwaged by the defendants in Noerr.\n                                \n\n     In so  doing,  the court  may  have overstated  its  holding\n\nunintentionally, permitting the inference drawn by the government\n\nthat the boycott itself was being held immune under Noerr.  As we\n                                                         \n\nhave  explained, such a holding would conflict with Supreme Court\n\ncaselaw.    Defendants'  boycott  plainly constituted  a  per  se\n                                                                 \n\nviolation  of  the Sherman  Act  even though  plaintiffs  seek no\n\nmarketplace damages resulting from it.\n\n                               IV.\n\n     The  central  issue  before  us is  whether  plaintiffs  may\n\nrecover  damages based  on the  higher rates  they have  paid for\n\nworkers'  compensation  insurance  since  enactment of  the  1987\n\n                    \n\n     6 We offer no view as to whether plaintiffs would  have been\nable to prove damages from a constriction of supply or absence of\nprice competition resulting from the conspiracy.\n\n                               -13-\n\nlegislation.

The district court believed that  the actions\n\nof  the legislature  and  Superintendent of  Insurance superseded\n\ndefendants' previous conduct, rendering the rate hikes \"an act of\n\ngovernment\" immune  under Parker rather than  an injury inflicted\n                                \n\nby defendants' conspiracy. \n\n     Plaintiffs offer  two reasons  why the Parker  doctrine does\n                                                  \n\nnot bar the relief they seek.  First, in an argument more heavily\n\nutilized  in the  district  court, plaintiffs  maintain that  the\n\ndefendants'  use of  unlawful  activity to  coerce the  favorable\n\nlegislation makes the Parker  doctrine inapplicable.  Because the\n                            \n\nlegislature unlawfully  was pressured  to act, they  contend, the\n\nstatute   may   not  be   used   to   insulate  defendants   from\n\nresponsibility.   Second, plaintiffs  argue that  it was  not the\n\nlegislation simply  permitting rate  hikes that harmed  them, but\n\nthe defendants'  longstanding  conspiracy to  charge the  maximum\n\npossible rates.\n\n                               -14-\n\n     Neither  of  these  arguments  is  persuasive.    The  first\n\ncontention,  that the defendants'  coercive conduct circumscribes\n\nthe effect of the legislature's actions, is directly contradicted\n\nby  Supreme Court precedent.  In a  recent case, Omni, 111 S.

The Court considered possible\n\nmethods   for  defining  a  conspiracy  exception,  including  an\n\napproach  that  would  make   Parker  inapplicable  only  if,  in\n                                    \n\nconnection with  the governmental action in  question, bribery or\n\nsome other  violation of state  or federal law  were established.\n\nId.  at 1353.  It  ultimately concluded that  any such limitation\n   \n\nwould  be,  at   best,  an  imprecise  way  to   determine  which\n\nanticompetitive state  actions should be  exempted from antitrust\n\nliability.\n\n     Such unlawful activity has no necessary relationship to\n     whether  the  governmental  action  is  in  the  public\n     interest.   A mayor is guilty of accepting a bribe even\n     if  he  would and  should  have  taken,  in the  public\n     interest, the same action for which the bribe was paid.\n\n                               -15-\n\n     . . . To  use unlawful political influence as  the test\n     of legality of  state regulation undoubtedly vindicates\n     (in a rather blunt  way) principles of good government.\n     But the statute  we are construing  is not directed  to\n     that end.\n\nId.\n   \n\n     The  holding in  Omni  fully embraces  plaintiffs'  tendered\n                          \n\ncoercion  exception.   Allegations  of  coercion,  like those  of\n\nconspiracy,   implicate  only   the  off-limits   issue   of  the\n\nlegislators' motivation.   Omni  reaffirms that the  state action\n                               \n\nprotection provided by Parker is not vulnerable to such claims.\n                             \n\n      Plaintiffs' second  theory bears  down more closely  on the\n\n1987  legislation.   Because the  statute does  not mandate  that\n                                                           \n\ninsurers charge the maximum  rates allowed by the Superintendent,\n\nbut  merely eliminated the caps imposed by the repealed 1985 Act,\n\nplaintiffs maintain  that  the higher  rates by  which they  were\n\ndamaged  resulted  from  defendants'  conspiracy  to  charge  the\n\nmaximum  rates  and not  from the  legislature's adoption  of the\n\nstatute.  We detect two problems with this argument.\n\n     First, the  manner in which plaintiffs  asserted this theory\n\nbefore the district court differed in a subtle, yet  significant,\n\nway  from  the  approach  adopted  on  appeal.    Throughout  the\n\nproceedings before the district court, plaintiffs emphasized that\n\nthey alleged injury from a conspiracy initiated in the summer and\n\nfall of 1987 to violate the 1985 legislation, which promoted open\n                                \n\ncompetition    in   the    workers'    compensation   market.    \n\n     Plaintiffs  do  not claim  that  they  were injured  by\n     actions  mandated by  the  1987  legislation.   Indeed,\n     plaintiffs allege  not only that  the conspiracy  began\n     before the 1987 legislation  was even enacted, but that\n\n                               -16-\n\n     the  objective   of  the   conspiracy  was   that  very\n                   \n     enactment.   Plaintiffs in  fact allege that  they were\n     injured by  defendants' conspiracy to violate  the 1985\n                                                            \n     legislation.    It is  therefore  the 1985  legislation\n     against which state action claims must be tested.\n\nPlaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants'  Joint Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, at 18 n.11 (emphasis in original).\n\n     At oral argument on  the summary judgment motion, plaintiffs\n\nagain  asserted that it had  been unlawful for  the defendants to\n\nconspire to increase prices  while the 1985 legislation governed.\n\nSee  App.  at  720.    When  the  district  court  asked why  the\n   \n\ndefendants' actions were not protected in light of their  \"acting\n\nwithin the framework set  up by the legislature in  the enactment\n\nof rates,\"  plaintiffs' counsel responded  that \"one needs  to be\n\nclear on the time frame.\"  Id. at 729.  He continued:\n                              \n\n     At the time the  conspiracy was hatched and effectuated\n     in summer and fall of 1987, the policy of the  State of\n     Maine  was  open competition  in  workers'  comp.   The\n     policy of the State of Maine was, \"Go compete with each\n     other.\"\n\n          And these defendants  had a private agreement,  in\n     effect, not to compete and to boycott consumers and the\n     state.\n\nId.\n   \n\n     Thus, the argument to the  district court focused on conduct\n\nleading  up to the 1987 act:  the defendants unlawfully conspired\n\nto  charge higher rates, and obtained permission to do so through\n\nunlawful  means,  making  the  new  rates  wholly   a  result  of\n\ndefendants' unlawful conduct.   Moreover, the plaintiffs  argued,\n\neven though the specific  harm for which they sought  damages did\n\nnot  occur until  after  the law  was  changed and  higher  rates\n\n                               -17-\n\nauthorized, defendants  had to be held responsible  so that their\n\npast  illegal  conduct  would  not  be  immunized  retroactively.\n\nFailing to hold them liable, plaintiffs argued,\n\n     would  lead to the  anomalous result  that unsuccessful\n                                                            \n     boycotts  (i.e.  boycotts  which  do  not  successfully\n                    \n     coerce   governmental   action)   would  be   antitrust\n     violations, but that successful boycotts (i.e. boycotts\n                                                   \n     to which government succumbs in order to avoid chaos or\n     disaster) would be immunized.\n\nPlaintiffs'  Memorandum  in  Opposition,  at  35-36 (emphasis  in\n\noriginal) (footnote omitted).7\n\n     The argument on appeal  unquestionably adds a new dimension.\n\nPlaintiffs  now contend  that,  after passage  of  the 1987  act,\n\ndefendants again violated antitrust  laws by conspiring to refuse\n\nto  sell  below   the  new  maximum  rates  established   by  the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance.   That agreement is  not entitled to\n\nstate action immunity, plaintiffs suggest, because  the provision\n\nin  the 1987  Act  allowing independent  ratesetting demonstrates\n\nthat  state  policy  still  favors  competition.    Consequently,\n\nplaintiffs contend that  defendants should be held liable for the\n\nrate increases.8\n\n                    \n\n     7  As we  made clear in  Section III,  the response  to this\nargument is that unlawful boycotts with direct marketplace impact\nwill result  in accountability for the  market injury, regardless\n                                              \nof their success in inducing governmental action.\n\n     8 We note that some  portions of plaintiffs' appellate brief\nretain the focus on the 1985 legislation:\n\n     Plaintiffs   do   not    challenge   the    Defendants'\n     \"participation  in  ratesetting  proceedings\"  in  1988\n     after  the 1987 legislation  was enacted  repealing the\n     1985 Competitive Rating Act.  What Plaintiffs challenge\n     is  Defendants' conspiracy begun in 1986 and 1987, at a\n                               \n     time   when  Maine  law  specifically  prohibited  such\n\n                               -18-\n\n     This link between plaintiffs'  conspiracy allegation and the\n\n1987  Act never  was offered  to the  district court;  indeed, as\n\nnoted above, plaintiffs  expressly disclaimed  the new  statute's\n\nrelevance to the  Parker issue.  The conspiracy achieved success,\n                        \n\nplaintiffs  asserted, when  the  State enacted  the law  allowing\n\nhigher  premiums.    See  Memorandum  in  Opposition  to  Summary\n                        \n\nJudgment, at 2-3 (quoted in  District Court Opinion, at 3).   Led\n\nby these  arguments, the district court  never considered whether\n\nthe defendants could be held responsible for the rate increases -\n\n- despite authorization  of those rates by  the state --  if they\n\nhad conspired not to deviate below the maximum rate.\n\n     Whether plaintiffs sufficiently preserved this argument need\n\nnot unduly detain us, however, because the theory is in any event\n\nunavailing.   When the  legislature enacted the  1987 statute, it\n\ndid not simply eliminate the ceiling on the permissible rates for\n\nworkers' compensation insurance, but it also  moved away from the\n\nstate's previous pro-competitive policy toward  ratesetting.  The\n\n1987 Act  provided for joint rate  filings9 and, in  our view, it\n\n                    \n\n     conspiracies, to  constrict supply, to fix  prices, and\n     to boycott consumers in order  to coerce the removal of\n                                                            \n     the existing price ceiling.\n                               \n\nPlaintiffs' Brief at 31 (additional emphasis added).\n\n     9 It did so  somewhat indirectly through repeal of  the 1985\nAct, which meant that the  joint ratemaking provisions that  then\nexisted  for  all lines  of insurance  sold  in Maine  again were\napplicable  to workers'  compensation  insurance.   In 1989,  the\nlegislature revised  the general  insurance ratemaking system  to\nencourage  competition, leaving  the joint  ratemaking provisions\napplicable only to the  workers' compensation providers.  Compare\n                                                                 \nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.  24-A,   2309 (West 1990) with  Me.

When  insurers work  together\n\nwithin  a state regulatory system to advocate rates that they all\n\npresumably  believe  are  appropriate  for  workers' compensation\n\ninsurance, we  fail to see  how it could be  illegal price fixing\n\nfor them also subsequently  to agree to charge the  rates allowed\n\nby the state, particularly when the approved rates fall below the\n\njointly proposed rates.\n\n     At a  minimum, it  must be lawful  for insurers to  agree to\n\ncharge  the approved  rate where,  as here,  the Superintendent's\n\nobligation is to establish rates that are \"[j]ust and reasonable\"\n\nand \"[b]ased only  on a  just and reasonable  profit.\"  Me.  Rev.\n\nStat.  Ann. tit. 24-A,    2363 (7)(A)(1),  (2).   Thus, while the\n\nstatute  stipulates  that  these rates  set  the  upper  limit on\n\npermissible charges, id.  at   2362,  the expectation clearly  is\n                        \n\nthat  the Superintendent's rates are the ones that generally will\n\nbe appropriate  for, and  thus used  by, all insurers.   In  this\n\ncontext,  the legislature  evidently  viewed the  sort of  \"price\n\nfixing\" alleged by plaintiffs as  benign; notably absent from the\n\n1987 statute is a provision contained in the 1985 Act prohibiting\n\ninsurers from agreeing  \"to adhere  to or  use a  rate or  rating\n\nplan,\" id. at   2347 (2) (1985) (repealed).\n          \n\n     Plaintiffs  rely  on the  provision  allowing  downward rate\n\ndeviation to  support their claim that  defendants' conspiracy to\n\ncharge  a uniform  rate was  unauthorized and,  consequently, not\n\n                               -20-\n\nimmunized  under Parker.  But  the fact that  insurers may charge\n                                                          \n\nless than the approved  rate is of little significance when it is\n\njuxtaposed with  the uniform approach  to ratemaking that  is the\n\noverriding characteristic of  the reformed system.   On its  own,\n\nthe  permissive provision  certainly does  not establish  a state\n\npolicy favoring  competitive  pricing.

Declining to \"believe that Congress\n                     \n\nintended  to resolve  conflicts between  two competing  interests\n\n[federalism  and  competition]   by  impairing  both  more   than\n\nnecesssary,\" id., the  Court concluded that \"a  state policy that\n                \n\nexpressly permits,  but does not  compel, anticompetitive conduct\n                 \n\nmay  be `clearly articulated' within  the meaning of Midcal,\" id.\n                                                                 \n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n     In  this  case,  it  is manifestly  clear  that  defendants'\n\nratemaking activities meet both  prongs of the Midcal test.   The\n                                                     \n\nnew scheme was  adopted by the legislature, fulfilling  the state\n\npolicy prong of the test, and the Superintendent's involvement in\n\nreviewing    and   modifying   the   insurers'   proposed   rates\n\nunquestionably  meets  prong two's  requirement  of active  state\n\nsupervision.    Indeed,  plaintiffs  expressly  acknowledge  that\n\nMidcal is  satisfied with respect to  the ratemaking proceedings.\n      \n\nSee  Reply Brief,  at  19 n.15.    Plaintiffs instead  hammer  on\n   \n\ndefendants'   \"converting   the   results  of   that   ratemaking\n\nproceeding,  i.e. a schedule of maximum or ceiling prices, into a\n                                       \n\nprivate agreement to  uniformly charge the maximum price,  and to\n       \n\n                               -22-\n\nrefuse  to deal at  prices below that  level.\"  Id.  (emphasis in\n                                                   \n\noriginal).\n\n     This argument misfires because it fails to take into account\n\nthe  changed landscape.  Even  if defendants violated the Sherman\n\nAct in  the late summer and  early fall of 1987  by conspiring to\n\nraise the maximum prices they could charge beyond those permitted\n\nby  the 1985  Act, it  does not  necessarily  follow that  it was\n\nunlawful  for  them to  agree  to  charge  the rate  subsequently\n\napproved  by the Superintendent pursuant  to the 1987  Act.  Once\n\nthe legislature  acted in November 1987,  defendants' conduct had\n\nto be assessed in  light of the new state policy  and procedures.\n\nAs  we   have  discussed,  the  1987   Act  endorsed  cooperative\n\nratesetting and anticipated that most, if not all, insurers would\n\ncharge  the newly  authorized  rates.   Accordingly, the  damages\n\nsought  by  plaintiffs  --  the differential  between  the  rates\n\nallowed  under  the  1985  Act  and  the  new  rates  charged  by\n\ndefendants under the 1987 Act  -- must be viewed as a  product of\n\nstate action.   The district court  therefore correctly concluded\n\nthat, under Parker,  defendants may not  be held accountable  for\n                  \n\nthis claimed injury.\n\n                               V. \n\n     In summary,  we hold  that the  economic  boycott and  price\n\nfixing conspiracy allegedly conducted by defendants in the summer\n\nand  early fall  of 1987  constituted a per  se violation  of the\n                                               \n\n                               -23-\n\nSherman  Act,  and  did  not  fall  within  the  Noerr doctrine's\n                                                      \n\nprotection for  concerted activity  designed to  elicit favorable\n\nlegislation.   But plaintiffs have not  sought damages for direct\n\nmarketplace injury inflicted by that conspiracy.\n\n     The monetary damages alleged by plaintiffs --  the amount of\n\nincrease in their workers' compensation insurance rates under the\n\n1987 statutory scheme allegedly coerced by  defendants -- are not\n\nrecoverable  from the  insurers.   Because  the state  authorized\n\ncollective  ratemaking  and  closely supervised  the  setting  of\n\nhigher  rates,  any  agreement  among defendants  to  charge  the\n\nmaximum  authorized  rates  is  permissible,  and defendants  are\n\nimmune from liability for the increase under the Parker doctrine.\n                                                       \n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                               -24-\n</pre>",
