Gale, United  States Attorney,  Margaret  E. Curran  and\n                                                             \nJames  H. Leavey,  Assistant  United States  Attorneys,  on brief  for\n            \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.    Appellant  Adegboyega  Akitoye  was\n                     \n\nconvicted of conspiracy to distribute and possession with the\n\nintent to  distribute heroin.  We affirmed  his conviction on\n\ndirect appeal.   See United  States v. Akitoye, 923  F.2d 221\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).   He then filed  a motion under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n2255 to vacate his sentence.  In the motion, appellant raised\n\ntwo related grounds:  (1)  his conviction for conspiracy  was\n\nobtained by the use of evidence  not relevant to him; and (2)\n\nthere  was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of\n\npossession  with the intent to distribute heroin.  On appeal,\n\nappellant argues that  the evidence was not  sufficient as to\n\nthe existence of  a conspiracy and  that his lawyer  provided\n\nineffective assistance by failing to raise the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence claim on direct appeal.1\n\n          Issues  not pursued on direct appeal are subject to\n\nthe  cause  and  prejudice standard  under  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nFrady, 456  U.S. 152, 167-68  (1982).  See Suveges  v.

Appellant also  raises an argument  concerning the  trial\ncourt's denial of the jury's request to have the testimony of\nthree witnesses  read to it.   However,  appellant failed  to\npresent this  ground when he  brought his   2255  petition in\nthe district court.   \"[A]n issue not presented  to the trial\ncourt  cannot  be  raised  for the  first  time  on  appeal.\"\nNogueira v. United States, 683 F.2d 576, 580 (1st Cir. 1982).\n                         \nIn all events,  this ground has  already been considered  and\nrejected on direct appeal.  See Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 225-27.\n                                       \n\nconstituted  procedural default;  movant therefore  must show\n\ncause and  prejudice to  obtain collateral  relief); Ford  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 983 F.2d 897, 898 (8th Cir. 1993) (per curiam)\n             \n\n(defendant was procedurally barred, absent a showing of cause\n\nand prejudice, from  raising issues in a    2255 motion which\n\nhe had failed  to pursue on direct appeal).   Thus, appellant\n\nis barred from  raising the claim concerning  the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence  unless he can show cause and  prejudice.  He\n\ncannot  establish `cause' here, except, perhaps, by resort to\n\nthe  principle that cause  can be established  by ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.  Suveges, 7 F.3d at 10; Ford, 983 F.2d\n                               \n\nat 898-99.\n\n          To show ineffectiveness, appellant must demonstrate\n\n\"that  counsel   fell  below  the  applicable   standard  for\n\nperformance, defined by  what the lawyer knew, or should have\n\nknown, at the time  of his/her tactical choices . . . .\"  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States  v. Fisher,  3 F.3d 456,  463 (1st  Cir. 1993).\n                        \n\nHere, what appellant's attorney knew at the time he filed the\n\nappeal was  that we had  upheld, on direct appeal,  the trial\n\njudge's  finding  that  appellant had  obstructed  justice by\n\nperjuring himself at  trial.  The  trial judge, in  enhancing\n\nappellant's  base offense  level,  had described  appellant's\n\ntestimony as  a \"self-serving `cock  and bull  story.'\"   923\n\nF.2d at 228.  Indeed,  in referring to appellant's attempt to\n\ncast his co-conspirator  as the \"villain\" by  disclaiming any\n\n                             -3-\n\nknowledge   of  the  drugs  or  marked  money  found  in  his\n\n(appellant's)  apartment, we stated:   \"Viewed as  a seamless\n\nweb,  the  record  stalwartly  supports  the conclusion  that\n\nAkitoye fabricated a fairy tale in a lame effort to avoid the\n\ncondign consequences  of his criminal  conduct.\"  Id  at 229.\n                                                    \n\nGiven  this scenario,  it  would  be  difficult  to  describe\n\ncounsel's  decision not  to contest  the  sufficiency of  the\n\nevidence  as anything  other than  a  tactical decision  well\n\nwithin what constitutes \"reasonable professional assistance.\"\n\nSee Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984).\n                            \n\n          Nor  do we think that appellant has established the\n\nsecond prong of  Strickland -- that he was  prejudiced by the\n                           \n\nfailure  of his  attorney  to present  this  issue on  direct\n\nappeal.   See id.  at 687.   We  have carefully  reviewed the\n                 \n\nrecord and find  that there was sufficient evidence, beyond a\n\nreasonable  doubt,  to  support  the jury's  conclusion  that\n\nappellant  had engaged in  a conspiracy to  distribute heroin\n\nand possession with the intent  to distribute it.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v.
