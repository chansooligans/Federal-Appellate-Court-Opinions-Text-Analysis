The  claimant, Ada  Baez, has  appealed a\n                \n\ndistrict court judgment affirming a decision of the Secretary\n\nof  Health and  Human Services  (the Secretary)  which denied\n\nBaez's  application for  disability insurance  benefits under\n\nthe  Social Security  Act, 42  U.S.C.    401  et  seq..   The\n                                                      \n\nSecretary  concluded   that  Baez  was  not   precluded  from\n\nperforming  her  past relevant  work  as  a secretary,  i.e.,\n                                                            \n\nreview was  terminated  at Step  4 of  the sequential  review\n\nprocess.   See  Goodermote  v. Secretary  of  Health &amp;  Human\n                                                             \n\nServs., 690 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1982).  We  have reviewed the\n      \n\nparties'  briefs and  the record  on appeal.   We  affirm the\n\njudgment of the  district court, entered on  August 17, 1993,\n\nessentially  for the  reasons stated in  the decision  of the\n\nadministrative law judge dated  August 16, 1991.  We  add the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n     The  issues  raised on  appeal  were not  raised  in the\n\ndistrict court and so are not preserved  for our review.  See\n                                                             \n\nGonzalez-Ayala  v. Secretary  of Health  &amp; Human  Servs., 807\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 255, 256 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam).  In any event, we\n\nwould not find them meritorious for the following reasons.\n\n     1.   Step 3  of the sequential evaluation  of disability\n\nprovides that the Secretary will find a claimant disabled  if\n\nthe  claimant  has an  impairment  which  meets the  duration\n\nrequirement and is  listed in  20 C.F.R. Pt.  404, Subpt.  P,\n\nApp. 1 (\"Appendix 1\") or is equal to a listed impairment.  20\n\n                             -2-\n\nC.F.R.   404.1520(d).   Baez argues that (1)  a determination\n\nof  medical equivalency must be  made by a  physician, (2) no\n\nsuch determination  of medical  equivalency was made  part of\n\nthe  record,  and  (3)   the  ALJ's  determination  that  her\n\ncondition did not equal a listed impairment, made without the\n\ntestimony of a medical  expert at the administrative hearing,\n\nwas error.   We do not quibble with  allegation (1), but find\n\nfault with contentions (2) and (3).\n\n     Preliminarily, we note that  it is the claimant's burden\n\nto  show that she has an impairment or impairments that meets\n\nor  equals  a listed  impairment in  Appendix  1.   Torres v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary  of Health &amp; Human  Servs., 870 F.2d  742, 745 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1989) (per curiam).   Baez does not even state  which of\n\nthe more  than 100 medical  listings contained in  Appendix 1\n\nshe purportedly  might  equal.    In any  event,  the  record\n\ncontains determinations by a psychiatrist and  a psychologist\n\nthat,  insofar as  Baez  has an  affective disorder  (Listing\n\n12.04),  it is not severe.  Record Transcript (Tr.) 128; 142.\n\nIn other words,  it does  not pass Step  2 in the  sequential\n                                          \n\nanalysis, and, a fortiori, it does not meet or equal a listed\n                         \n\nimpairment (Step  3).   Thus, contrary to  Baez's contention,\n\nthere was  record evidence of a medical  judgment that Baez's\n         \n\ncondition  did  not meet  or equal  a  medical listing.   Her\n\nresulting contention  - that the  lack of record  evidence on\n\nthe issue  of  medical  equivalency  required  a  physician's\n\n                             -3-\n\ntestimony at  the hearing -  based as it  is on  an erroneous\n\npremise, necessarily falls.\n\n     2.   Contrary to Baez's allegation, the ALJ's evaluation\n\nof her  complaints of  pain  comported with  our decision  in\n\nAvery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 797 F.2d 19 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir. 1986).\n\n     3.   Baez  complains that  the ALJ's  decision does  not\n\naddress a residual functional capacity  (RFC) assessment from\n\nher  treating physician.   The  document she  references (Tr.\n\n258)  is an RFC form signed by a physician whose signature is\n\nillegible and whose name Baez does  not provide.  It is dated\n\nJune 10, 1986 - a date within a previously-adjudicated period\n\nof  nondisability  and  prior   to  any  possible  period  of\n\ndisability at issue  here (May 27, 1988  through December 31,\n\n1990).   It  is  unaccompanied by  any report  explaining the\n\nbasis  for the RFC limitations  noted thereon.   There was no\n\nerror in the ALJ's failure to address this document.\n\n     4.   Baez  contends that, in determining that Baez could\n\nperform her past relevant work as a secretary, the ALJ failed\n\nto consider the restrictions posed by her emotional condition\n\nand  the pain  she  feels in  her  hands and  from  prolonged\n\nsitting.  Baez is wrong.  It is clear from the ALJ's decision\n\nthat  he  evaluated  her   allegations  of  pain  and  mental\n\nimpairment.   He  concluded,  nonetheless, that  Baez is  not\n\nprecluded from performing her past job as a secretary.  There\n\n                             -4-\n\nis  substantial evidence  to support  that conclusion.   See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Tr. 168; 234-40; 241-48.\n    \n\n     Judgment affirmed.\n                       \n\n                             -5-\n",

Baez contends that, in determining that Baez could perform her past relevant work as a secretary, the ALJ failed to consider the restrictions posed by her emotional condition and the pain she feels in her hands and from prolonged sitting.  Baez is wrong.  It is clear from the ALJ's decision that he evaluated her allegations of pain and mental impairment.  He concluded, nonetheless, that Baez is not precluded from performing her past job as a secretary.  There is substantial evidence to support that conclusion.  See, e.g., Tr. 168;  234- 40;  241-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
