In this appeal,  defendant-\n                              \n\nappellant   Space  Ventures,  Inc.   (\"SVI\"  or  \"defendant\")\n\nchallenges the  entry of a preliminary  injunction against it\n\nand in  favor  of  plaintiff-appellee  Alan  Shawn  Feinstein\n\n(\"Feinstein\" or  \"plaintiff\").1    Finding that  the district\n\ncourt  erred in  determining  that  plaintiff demonstrated  a\n\nlikelihood of success on  the merits of his claim,  we vacate\n\nand remand.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          On  April  8,   1992,  plaintiff,  a   marketer  of\n\ncollectibles,  initiated  this  litigation by  filing  a four\n\ncount  complaint against  defendant SVI,  a manufacturer  and\n\ndistributor  of trading cards.  Counts I and II asserted that\n\ndefendant had converted certain  of plaintiff's goods and had\n\nbreached a duty of confidentiality owed to plaintiff.  Counts\n\n                    \n\n1.  As an  initial matter, we note  that plaintiff challenges\nour jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  In so doing, he relies\nupon authority  indicating that an interlocutory  order which\nhas the  incidental effect  of denying injunctive  relief can\nonly be appealed under 28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1) where the order\nwill have a \"`serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence'\" and\nwhere  it  \"can  be   `effectively  challenged'  only  by  an\nimmediate appeal.\"   See Stringfellow v.  Concerned Neighbors\n                                                             \nin  Action,  480 U.S.  370,  379  (1987) (quoting  Carson  v.\n                                                         \nAmerican  Brands,  Inc.,  450  U.S.  79,  84 (1981)).    Such\n                       \nauthority  is inapposite  here, however,  where the  order at\nissue clearly and  directly granted a preliminary  injunction\nafter   a   hearing   on   plaintiff's    request   therefor.\nAccordingly,  because  28  U.S.C.     1292(a)(1)   grants  us\njurisdiction  over  \"interlocutory  orders  of  the  district\ncourts  . . .  granting . .  . injunctions,\" we  find that we\nhave jurisdiction over this appeal.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nIII  and  IV stated  that defendant  had breached  a contract\n\nentered into by the parties  on September 4, 1991.   On April\n\n28, 1992, plaintiff amended his  complaint to include a fifth\n\ncount for unfair competition.2\n\n          The present appeal concerns only  plaintiff's Count\n\nII,  which  is  entitled  \"Breach of  Confidentiality.\"    In\n\nrelevant part, Count II states:\n\n          8.   On  or about  January 23,  1991, and\n          divers  times thereafter,  defendant held\n          goods consisting  of a series  of trading\n          cards known as the Moon-Mars cards.  Said\n          cards had been  purchased from  defendant\n          by plaintiff and were being held in trust\n          for  distribution  by  defendant;   as  a\n          bailee.\n\n          9.   Defendant was  obligated to ship the\n          Moon-Mars cards  to plaintiff's customers\n          in  accordance  with the  instructions of\n          plaintiff. . . .\n\n          15.  While acting as  a bailee, defendant\n          received  confidential  information  from\n          plaintiff      concerning     plaintiff's\n          customers.\n\n          16.  Defendant had  a duty not to divulge\n          said information or  use the  information\n          for its own benefit.\n\n          17.    Defendant  indicated to  plaintiff\n          that  it has no  intention of recognizing\n          its  duty,  and has  caused  plaintiff to\n          have reasonable grounds  to believe  that\n          defendant will breach its duty  and shall\n          actively solicit plaintiff's customers. .\n          . .   Defendant's principal  officer has,\n          in subsequent conversations to plaintiff,\n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant  subsequently  counterclaimed  for   breach  of\ncontract.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          orally  evidenced  his intent  to solicit\n          plaintiff's customers.\n\n          18.  Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed\n          if  defendant  solicits his  customers in\n          that the confidentiality of  his customer\n          list    will     be    permanently    and\n          irretrievably impaired.\n\n          19.  As a further result,  plaintiff will\n          sustain  an  irreparable   loss  to   his\n          business reputation for which there is no\n          adequate remedy at law.\n\nCount  II  concludes  with  a  request  for   damages  and  a\n\npreliminary and permanent  injunction directing defendant (1)\n\nto  refrain from  soliciting  plaintiff's customers,  (2)  to\n\nrefrain from using plaintiff's  customer list, (3) to refrain\n\nfrom selling or distributing  plaintiff's customer list,  (4)\n\nto return plaintiff's  customer list, and  (5) to provide  an\n\naccount of plaintiff's customers solicited by defendant.\n\n          On July 2, 1992, the district court held  a hearing\n\non the  injunctive relief requested in  plaintiff's Count II.\n\nAt  this  hearing,  plaintiff  proceeded as  if  the  duty of\n\nconfidentiality  referenced in  Count II  was contract-based.\n\nMore  specifically,  plaintiff testified  that  defendant was\n\nabout  to breach an  oral agreement between  the parties that\n\ndefendant would  not use plaintiff's customer  list and would\n\nkeep  the list  confidential.3  Although  it is  not entirely\n\n                    \n\n3.  During  the  course  of   the  hearing,  plaintiff   also\nintroduced  affidavits from  Beverly  S. Vale  and Edward  P.\nWalton  tending  to support  plaintiff's  claim  that he  and\ndefendant had an oral  agreement, and that the duty  at issue\nin Count II arose from this agreement.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nclear, it seems that  the district court also  operated under\n\nthis  assumption.  In the  portion of its  ruling which comes\n\nclosest to addressing (1) whether defendant had a duty not to\n\nuse the list  and to keep  the list confidential and  (2) how\n\nany such duty arose, the district court stated:\n\n               [T]he     uncontradicted    evidence\n          primarily  in the form  of testimony from\n          Mr.  Feinstein  was  that   the[re]  were\n          discussions  between  him  and Mr.  White\n          [President  of  SVI]   relating  to   the\n          confidentiality  of  these  lists and  he\n          entered  into  [the contract  under which\n          plaintiff had provided defendant with his\n          customer    list]   with    the   express\n          understanding that these  lists would  be\n          held  in  confidence   and  he   received\n          assurances  to  that  [e]ffect  from  Mr.\n          White.\n               So  based on all  those things, it's\n          not  difficult at  all for  the Court  to\n          determine that . .  . Mr. Feinstein has a\n          very good chance of succeeding in proving\n          that  the list  is his property,  that it\n          was confidential and that the [d]efendant\n          has no right to use it.4\n\nThe  district court  also found  that plaintiff  would suffer\n\nimmediate  and irreparable  harm if  the injunction  were not\n\ngranted, that such harm outweighed any harm to defendant, and\n\nthat  the public interest would not  be adversely affected by\n\nproviding  plaintiff  with the  relief  requested.   See  id.\n                                                             \n\nTherefore,  the   district   court  entered   an   injunction\n\n                    \n\n4.  The district court  made these findings in  the course of\nconsidering,   as  it  must   before  issuing  a  preliminary\ninjunction, whether  plaintiff was  likely to succeed  on the\nmerits of his claim.  See, e.g., Narragansett Indian Tribe v.\n                                                          \nGuilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).\n        \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nforbidding  defendant from  using plaintiff's  customer list.\n\nThis appeal followed. \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, defendant argues,  inter alia, that  the\n                                                  \n\ndistrict   court  erred   in   ruling   that  plaintiff   had\n\ndemonstrated a  likelihood of  success on  the merits of  his\n\nCount II claim.  After carefully reviewing the record, we are\n\nconstrained to agree.\n\n          It  is  settled  that  \"`we  scrutinize  a district\n\ncourt's decision  to grant  or deny a  preliminary injunction\n\nunder  a   relatively  deferential  glass.'\"    Id.  (quoting\n                                                   \n\nIndependent  Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp;\n                                                             \n\nGamble Mfg. Co.,  864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.  1988)).  Thus,\n               \n\nunless the district court has made a mistake of law or abused\n\nits  discretion, we  will not  disturb its  ruling.   See id.\n                                                             \n\nHowever,  \"`[a]pplication of  an  improper legal  standard in\n\ndetermining  the  likelihood  of  success on  the  merits  or\n\nmisapplication  of the law to particular facts is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.'\"   In re  Rare Coin Galleries  of America, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n862 F.2d 896, 900 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Planned Parenthood\n                                                             \n\nLeague v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1st Cir. 1981)).\n                  \n\n          In this  instance,  the district  court applied  an\n\nimproper  legal standard  in  determining that  plaintiff had\n\ndemonstrated a  likelihood of  success on  the merits of  his\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nbreach of  confidentiality claim.  The  record indicates that\n\nthe district  court assumed  that plaintiff's Count  II claim\n\nwas  based  upon  an  oral  contract  between  plaintiff  and\n\ndefendant.  The problem  with this, though, is that  Count II\n\ndoes  not  sound in  contract.5    As we  read  it, Count  II\n\nattempts to set forth a claim for breach of a common law duty\n\nnot  to divulge  or use  \"confidential\" information.6   Thus,\n\nthe  district  court's ruling  that  plaintiff  is likely  to\n\nsucceed  on  his  Count II  claim,  made  as  it was  without\n\nreference to  common law confidentiality  principles, was  an\n\nabuse of its  discretion.  Accordingly, the court's  entry of\n\nthe preliminary  injunction in  favor of plaintiff,  which is\n\nanchored upon this faulty ruling, must be set aside.7\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                         CONCLUSION  \n                         CONCLUSION\n                                   \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  preliminary\n\ninjunction  entered in favor  of plaintiff  on his  breach of\n\n                    \n\n5.  Nothing in Count II even remotely suggests that  the duty\nof  confidentiality  arises  from  an   explicit  contractual\nprovision.\n\n6.  In so stating, we do not decide whether Count II, in  its\ncurrent incarnation, is sufficient to state such a claim.\n\n7.  Because  we  find  that  the district  court  abused  its\ndiscretion  in  determining  that  plaintiff  was  likely  to\nsucceed on the merits of his breach of confidentiality claim,\nwe vacate  and remand without  considering defendants'  other\nchallenges to the district court's injunction order.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nconfidentiality claim  is vacated.8  This  action is remanded\n\nto the district court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n                               \n\n                    \n\n8.  Of  course,  defendant  should  in no  way  construe  our\ndissolution  of  the  injunction  as an  endorsement  of  its\nargument  that it  is  entitled to  use plaintiff's  customer\nlist.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

As an  initial matter, we note  that plaintiff challenges\nour jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  In so doing, he relies\nupon authority  indicating that an interlocutory  order which\nhas the  incidental effect  of denying injunctive  relief can\nonly be appealed under 28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1) where the order\nwill have a \"`serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence'\" and\nwhere  it  \"can  be   `effectively  challenged'  only  by  an\nimmediate appeal.\"   See Stringfellow v.

On April\n\n28, 1992, plaintiff amended his  complaint to include a fifth\n\ncount for unfair competition.2\n\n          The present appeal concerns only  plaintiff's Count\n\nII,  which  is  entitled  \"Breach of  Confidentiality.\"    In\n\nrelevant part, Count II states:\n\n          8.   On  or about  January 23,  1991, and\n          divers  times thereafter,  defendant held\n          goods consisting  of a series  of trading\n          cards known as the Moon-Mars cards.  Said\n          cards had been  purchased from  defendant\n          by plaintiff and were being held in trust\n          for  distribution  by  defendant;   as  a\n          bailee.\n\n          9.   Defendant was  obligated to ship the\n          Moon-Mars cards  to plaintiff's customers\n          in  accordance  with the  instructions of\n          plaintiff. . . .\n\n          15.  While acting as  a bailee, defendant\n          received  confidential  information  from\n          plaintiff      concerning     plaintiff's\n          customers.\n\n          16.  Defendant had  a duty not to divulge\n          said information or  use the  information\n          for its own benefit.\n\n          17.    Defendant  indicated to  plaintiff\n          that  it has no  intention of recognizing\n          its  duty,  and has  caused  plaintiff to\n          have reasonable grounds  to believe  that\n          defendant will breach its duty  and shall\n          actively solicit plaintiff's customers. .\n          . .   Defendant's principal  officer has,\n          in subsequent conversations to plaintiff,\n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant  subsequently  counterclaimed  for   breach  of\ncontract.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          orally  evidenced  his intent  to solicit\n          plaintiff's customers.\n\n          18.  Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed\n          if  defendant  solicits his  customers in\n          that the confidentiality of  his customer\n          list    will     be    permanently    and\n          irretrievably impaired.\n\n          19.  As a further result,  plaintiff will\n          sustain  an  irreparable   loss  to   his\n          business reputation for which there is no\n          adequate remedy at law.\n\nCount  II  concludes  with  a  request  for   damages  and  a\n\npreliminary and permanent  injunction directing defendant (1)\n\nto  refrain from  soliciting  plaintiff's customers,  (2)  to\n\nrefrain from using plaintiff's  customer list, (3) to refrain\n\nfrom selling or distributing  plaintiff's customer list,  (4)\n\nto return plaintiff's  customer list, and  (5) to provide  an\n\naccount of plaintiff's customers solicited by defendant.\n\n          On July 2, 1992, the district court held  a hearing\n\non the  injunctive relief requested in  plaintiff's Count II.\n\nAt  this  hearing,  plaintiff  proceeded as  if  the  duty of\n\nconfidentiality  referenced in  Count II  was contract-based.\n\nMore  specifically,  plaintiff testified  that  defendant was\n\nabout  to breach an  oral agreement between  the parties that\n\ndefendant would  not use plaintiff's customer  list and would\n\nkeep  the list  confidential.3  Although  it is  not entirely\n\n                    \n\n3.  During  the  course  of   the  hearing,  plaintiff   also\nintroduced  affidavits from  Beverly  S. Vale  and Edward  P.\nWalton  tending  to support  plaintiff's  claim  that he  and\ndefendant had an oral  agreement, and that the duty  at issue\nin Count II arose from this agreement.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nclear, it seems that  the district court also  operated under\n\nthis  assumption.  In the  portion of its  ruling which comes\n\nclosest to addressing (1) whether defendant had a duty not to\n\nuse the list  and to keep  the list confidential and  (2) how\n\nany such duty arose, the district court stated:\n\n               [T]he     uncontradicted    evidence\n          primarily  in the form  of testimony from\n          Mr.  Feinstein  was  that   the[re]  were\n          discussions  between  him  and Mr.  White\n          [President  of  SVI]   relating  to   the\n          confidentiality  of  these  lists and  he\n          entered  into  [the contract  under which\n          plaintiff had provided defendant with his\n          customer    list]   with    the   express\n          understanding that these  lists would  be\n          held  in  confidence   and  he   received\n          assurances  to  that  [e]ffect  from  Mr.\n          White.\n               So  based on all  those things, it's\n          not  difficult at  all for  the Court  to\n          determine that . .  . Mr. Feinstein has a\n          very good chance of succeeding in proving\n          that  the list  is his property,  that it\n          was confidential and that the [d]efendant\n          has no right to use it.4\n\nThe  district court  also found  that plaintiff  would suffer\n\nimmediate  and irreparable  harm if  the injunction  were not\n\ngranted, that such harm outweighed any harm to defendant, and\n\nthat  the public interest would not  be adversely affected by\n\nproviding  plaintiff  with the  relief  requested.   See  id.\n                                                             \n\nTherefore,  the   district   court  entered   an   injunction\n\n                    \n\n4.  The district court  made these findings in  the course of\nconsidering,   as  it  must   before  issuing  a  preliminary\ninjunction, whether  plaintiff was  likely to succeed  on the\nmerits of his claim.

The  record indicates that\n\nthe district  court assumed  that plaintiff's Count  II claim\n\nwas  based  upon  an  oral  contract  between  plaintiff  and\n\ndefendant.  The problem  with this, though, is that  Count II\n\ndoes  not  sound in  contract.5    As we  read  it, Count  II\n\nattempts to set forth a claim for breach of a common law duty\n\nnot  to divulge  or use  \"confidential\" information.6   Thus,\n\nthe  district  court's ruling  that  plaintiff  is likely  to\n\nsucceed  on  his  Count II  claim,  made  as  it was  without\n\nreference to  common law confidentiality  principles, was  an\n\nabuse of its  discretion.  Accordingly, the court's  entry of\n\nthe preliminary  injunction in  favor of plaintiff,  which is\n\nanchored upon this faulty ruling, must be set aside.7\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                         CONCLUSION  \n                         CONCLUSION\n                                   \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  preliminary\n\ninjunction  entered in favor  of plaintiff  on his  breach of\n\n                    \n\n5.  Nothing in Count II even remotely suggests that  the duty\nof  confidentiality  arises  from  an   explicit  contractual\nprovision.\n\n6.  In so stating, we do not decide whether Count II, in  its\ncurrent incarnation, is sufficient to state such a claim.\n\n7.  Because  we  find  that  the district  court  abused  its\ndiscretion  in  determining  that  plaintiff  was  likely  to\nsucceed on the merits of his breach of confidentiality claim,\nwe vacate  and remand without  considering defendants'  other\nchallenges to the district court's injunction order.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nconfidentiality claim  is vacated.8  This  action is remanded\n\nto the district court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n                               \n\n                    \n\n8.
