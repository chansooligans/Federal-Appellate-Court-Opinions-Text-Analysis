See\n                                                                 \n\n                                2\n\nEaton  v.

Sav. &amp;  Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884,\n                                                  \n\n891 (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n          The complaint alleges that Heno sold Balcol Corporation\n\na 104-acre tract of real property  in 1986, for which Balcol gave\n\nHeno  a  promissory  note secured  by  a  first  mortgage on  the\n\nundeveloped property.  In September 1987, Balcol began to develop\n\nthe  property,   known  as   the  Prospect   Heights  residential\n\nsubdivision,  and obtained  construction  financing through  Home\n\nNational Bank of  Milford (\"Bank\").   Heno agreed to  subordinate\n\nhis  first mortgage to the Bank's construction loan mortgage.  In\n\nreturn for the release of Heno's second mortgage lien as each lot\n\nwas  sold, Balcol and the  Bank promised to  release $19,125 from\n\nthe sale proceeds.\n\n          By April 1990, Balcol  and Prospect Heights were exper-\n\niencing financial  difficulties, and the three  principal parties\n\nentered into a recapitalization agreement.  Heno agreed to accept\n\n$5,000 (rather  than $19,125)  per lot  for releasing  his second\n\nmortgage  lien on the next nine lots  sold by Balcol.  Balcol and\n\nthe Bank agreed:   (1) to  transfer two additional  lots to  Heno\n\n(Lots 82 and  111), free and clear  of the Bank's  first mortgage\n\nliens, at the time Heno released his  second mortgage lien on the\n\nninth lot; and (2) to deposit the net proceeds from the nine lots\n\nin  escrow with  the Bank.   The  escrow monies  were to  be used\n\nexclusively for  immediate completion of roadwork  in the project\n\nandto defray Balcol's firstmortgage interest paymentsto the Bank.\n                                            \n\n                                3\n\n          Although  Balcol conveyed  Lots 82 and  111 to  Heno on\n\nMay 2, 1990, the Bank did not release its first mortgage liens on\n\nthe lots.  During April and  May 1990, seven of the nine original\n\nlots were  sold by the  Bank after Heno  had released his  second\n\nmortgage liens.   By June 1,  1990, more than  $232,000 had  been\n\ndeposited   in   escrow   with   the   Bank   pursuant   to   the\n\nrecapitalization  agreement  among  Heno, Balcol,  and  the Bank.\n\nUltimately,  the eighth  and ninth  lots were  sold, and  the net\n\nproceeds, approximating $90,000, were  deposited with FDIC.1  The\n\ncomplaint  alleges, hence  we must assume,  that $125,000  was to\n\nhave been devoted to roadwork at the project.2\n\n          On June 1,  1990, the  Bank was declared  insolvent and\n\nFDIC  was appointed receiver.  At an unspecified later date, FDIC\n\napplied  the escrow monies  toward the principal  due on Balcol's\n                                                \n\nfirst  mortgage  loan  account with  the  Bank,  contrary  to the\n\nexpress terms of the  recapitalization agreement.  Heno's counsel\n\nthereafter held discussions with FDIC, and was informed by Balcol\n\nthat FDIC  would determine, after  obtaining an appraisal  of the\n\nProspect  Heights project,  whether to  release the  Bank's first\n\nmortgage liens on  Lots 82 and  111, the two  additional lots  at\n\n                    \n\n     1The complaint  does not specify the date(s) of these sales,\nbut  the proceeds were deposited with FDIC on or about October 1,\n1990.\n\n     2At  oral  argument,  Heno's  counsel  represented  that the\nroadwork was never performed.\n\n                                4\n\nissue  on  appeal.     On  December 13,   1990,3  and  again   on\n\nFebruary 19, 1991, Heno submitted  written requests for action by\n\nFDIC, but to  no avail.4   Subsequently, FDIC  foreclosed on  the\n\nProspect Heights  subdivision, including  Lots 82  and 111.   The\n\nescrow  monies were  neither redeposited  nor applied  toward the\n\npurposes agreed upon under the recapitalization agreement.\n\n          On October 18,  1991, Heno initiated the present action\n\nto  enjoin FDIC's sale  of Lots  82 and 111  and to compel  it to\n\nredeposit  the escrow  monies previously  misapplied to  Balcol's\n\nfirst  mortgage  with  the  Bank.    The  complaint  demanded  an\n\nequitable  accounting  of  the  escrow  monies, and  compensatory\n\n                    \n\n     3Heno's December 13 letter specifically requested release of\nthe Bank's  first mortgage liens  on Lots  82 and 111  and served\n\"notice of [Heno's] contingent interest in [the escrow account].\"\nThe letter went on to say:\n\n     Heno  should receive  either the  lot releases  or that\n     portion  of  the  escrow account  attributable  to  his\n     participation in the agreement.  Under well established\n                                                            \n     fiduciary and equitable principles,  if the FDIC is not\n                                                            \n     going to honor the purposes of the escrow account, that\n                                                            \n     portion  of the escrow  account attributable  to Heno's\n                                                            \n     participation should  be returned to him,  and not used\n                                                            \n     by the Receiver to reduce Balcol's obligation.\n                                                  \n\n(Emphasis  added.)     Heno's  complaint  demands   an  equitable\naccounting  of  the escrow  monies,  and,  accordingly, does  not\nspecify  the  exact  amount  claimed.    However,  were  Heno  to\nestablish a  repudiation  of the  recapitalization agreement,  he\ncould  be expected to assert  a claim for  the difference between\nthe  $19,125 originally  agreed  upon, and  the  $5,000 he  later\nagreed to accept under the recapitalization agreement for releas-\ning his second mortgage liens on the nine lots sold by Balcol (or\napproximately $127,000).\n\n     4The February 19, 1991, letter outlines, among other things,\nthe evidence relating to Heno's interest in the escrow monies and\ncertain  subdivision  lots,  and  makes  reference  to additional\nletters not included in the appellate record.\n\n                                5\n\nrelief for the loss  occasioned by FDIC's refusal to  release the\n\nBank's first  mortgage liens on Lots  82 and 111.   FDIC moved to\n\ndismiss the  claim for compensatory  relief pursuant  to Fed.  R.\n\nCiv. 12(b)(1), and  the claim for  injunctive relief pursuant  to\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   The  district court decided  that it\n\nlacked jurisdiction to consider the claim for compensatory relief\n\nby virtue  of 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D)(i),  and that injunctive\n\nrelief was precluded by 12 U.S.C.   1821(j).\n\nB.   The Original Panel Opinion\n                               \n\n          FIRREA   1821(d) regulates  the filing,  determination,\n\nand  payment of  \"claims\"  against \"assets\"  of failed  financial\n\ninstitutions after FDIC has been appointed receiver.  Subsections\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)  and (C) require FDIC to publish and mail notice of\n\nliquidation to  \"any creditor  shown on the  institution's books\"\n\nand to allow at least ninety days for filing \"claims.\"  12 U.S.C.\n\n  1821(d)(3)(B),  (C).  As FDIC points out, anyone with a \"claim\"\n\nagainst  the  assets of  the  failed institution  must  submit an\n\nadministrative  claim to  FDIC  within  the prescribed  statutory\n\nperiod.     Id.     1821(d)(5)(C).     \"[P]articipation  in   the\n               \n\nadministrative  claims  review  process  [is] mandatory  for  all\n\nparties asserting  claims  against failed  institutions  . . . .\"\n\nMarquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1992).  Failure to\n               \n\nparticipate   in   the  administrative   claims   review  process\n\n(hereinafter  \"ACRP\")  is  a  \"jurisdictional  bar\"  to  judicial\n\nreview.

Shain,\n                                                                 \n\nSchaffer &amp; Rafanello, 944 F.2d 129, 132 (3d Cir. 1991) (\"Congress\n                    \n\n                                6\n\nexpressly withdrew jurisdiction from all courts over any claim to\n\na  failed bank's assets that are [sic] made outside the procedure\n\nset forth in section  1821.\").5  The subsection 1821(d)  bar date\n\nfor  filing  administrative  claims   in  the  present  case  was\n\nSeptember 6,  1990.    Since  neither  letter  detailing   Heno's\n\n\"claims\" predated  the bar date,  see supra  notes 3  and 4,  the\n                                           \n\ndistrict  court ruled  that Heno  could no  longer file  a timely\n\nadministrative  claim  under  subsection 1821(d),  and  that  his\n\n\"claims\" therefore were not entitled to judicial review.\n\n          Heno  consistently  has  advanced  two  contentions  on\n\nappeal.   First,  he argues  that neither  FIRREA    1821(j), see\n                                                                 \n\ninfra note 8, nor the ACRP established under  subsection 1821(d),\n     \n\napplies to \"non-creditors\"    including Heno    who assert claims\n\nto  property, such as  the alleged escrow  account, which, though\n\nheld by the failed bank, is held \"in trust\" for third parties and\n       \n\n                    \n\n     5Section 1821(d)(13)(D) provides:\n\n          (D)  Limitation on judicial review\n\n               Except  as otherwise provided  in this subsection,\n          no court shall have jurisdiction over   \n\n               (i)  any claim or action for payment from, or\n                    any  action  seeking a  determination of\n                    rights  with respect  to, the  assets of\n                    any depository institution for which the\n                    Corporation has been appointed receiver,\n                    including  assets which  the Corporation\n                    may   acquire   from   itself  as   such\n                    receiver; or\n\n               (ii) any   claim  relating  to   any  act  or\n                    omission  of  such  institution  or  the\n                    Corporation as receiver.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D).\n\n                                7\n\nis not  a bank  \"asset.\"6   See,  e.g., Purcell  v.

Second,  and  in the  alternative, Heno\n\ncontends  that his claim for  compensatory relief should not have\n\nbeen  dismissed for  failure  to comply  with the  administrative\n\nclaim procedure established under subsection 1821(d).\n\n          The \"task of interpretation begins with the text of the\n\nstatute  itself,  and statutory  language  must  be accorded  its\n\nordinary  meaning.\"   Telematics  Int'l,  Inc.  v.

The original\n\npanel opinion  rejected FDIC's contention that  Heno was required\n\nto file an administrative  claim before the bar date  even though\n                                       \n\nthe \"claim\" was grounded in a pre-receivership agreement with the\n                                              \n\nBank  and remained executory and unrepudiated both at the time of\n\nFDIC's appointment  and throughout  the entire 90-day  bar period\n\nprescribed in subsections 1821(d)(3)(B)(i)  and 1821(d)(5)(C)(i).\n\n                    \n\n     6At reargument,  Heno urged  that   1821(d)(13)(D)  be ruled\nwholly inapplicable for this reason, suggesting that the issue is\nripe  for appellate  review  because it  might  affect any  later\ndistrict court decision as to the scope of Heno's damages remedy.\nWe decline the invitation  for two reasons.  First,  given FDIC's\nblanket concession at reargument, the \"asset\" issue is  no longer\nessential  to  proper resolution  of  the  question of  appellate\njurisdiction.    Second, the  district  court  has  yet  to  make\nfindings  as to  whether (or  which) Bank  records may  have been\nlost.   On remand, therefore, Heno may confront a serious problem\nof proof.  See D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942);\n                                           \nsee also 12  U.S.C.   1823(e).   Thus, though  the D'Oench  Duhme\n                                                                 \ndocument  requirement is  not  jurisdictional, and  Heno will  be\nentitled to reasonable discovery, see generally Tuxedo Beach Club\n                                                                 \nCorp. v.

Because\n\nHeno    no doubt like  many others who assert claims  arising out\n\nof executory  contracts  with a  failed  bank     concededly  had\n\nactual notice  of FDIC's appointment,  but held no  assertable or\n                                                  \n\nprovable  \"claim\" until  after the bar  date, the  original panel\n                              \n\nopinion  reasoned  that  the  ACRP  established under  subsection\n\n1821(d)  rationally  could not  have  been  intended to  preclude\n\njudicial review of  post-receivership \"claims\" which  arise after\n                                                                 \n\nthe expiration  of the 90-day administrative-claim filing period.\n\nRather, inasmuch as FDIC received two post-bar date requests from\n\nHeno that it either affirm or repudiate the alleged reaffirmation\n\nagreement   within  a   \"reasonable  period   following  [FDIC's]\n\nappointment,\" see 12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(2); supra notes 3 and 4, we\n                                               \n\nheld Heno's claim for contract repudiation subject instead to the\n\nmore flexible  time constraints established in  FIRREA   1821(e).\n\nSee,  e.g., Ceguerra v.

The Petition for Rehearing\n                               \n\n          The petition for rehearing  represents that but for the\n\nfact  that these  claims  were never  considered claims  based on\n\ncontract repudiation, FDIC would have invoked its extant internal\n                                                        \n\nagency manual procedures for processing such post-bar date claims\n\n(hereinafter:   \"internal manual procedures\").  Accordingly, FDIC\n\nurged remand to  permit the district  court to determine  whether\n\nHeno  had  complied with  the  internal  manual procedures  first\n\ndisclosed in FDIC's petition for  rehearing.  At reargument, FDIC\n\nwithdrew its request for  remand, as unnecessary, after conceding\n\n                    \n\n          before appointment of conservator or receiver\n\n     (1)  Authority to repudiate contracts\n\n          In addition  to any other rights  a conservator or\n     receiver may have, the  conservator or receiver for any\n     insured   depository   institution  may   disaffirm  or\n     repudiate any contract or lease   \n\n          (A)  to which such institution is a party;\n\n          (B)  the  performance of which  the conservator or\n               receiver, in the conservator's  or receiver's\n               discretion, determines to be burdensome; and\n\n          (C)  the disaffirmance or repudiation of which the\n               conservator  or  receiver determines,  in the\n               conservator's or  receiver's discretion, will\n               promote  the  orderly  administration of  the\n               institution's affairs.\n\n     (2)  Timing of repudiation\n\n          The  conservator  or  receiver  appointed  for any\n     insured  depository  institution  in   accordance  with\n     subsection (c) of this section  shall determine whether\n     or not to exercise the rights of repudiation under this\n     subsection  within a  reasonable period  following such\n     appointment.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(1), (2).\n\n                                10\n\nthat Heno's detailed letter requests to FDIC in December 1990 and\n\nFebruary 1991,  see supra notes 3 and 4, placed FDIC on notice of\n                         \n\nthe  existence and  nature  of Heno's  post-bar date  claims well\n\nwithin the time allotted under FDIC's internal manual procedures.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Given the concession  that Heno's post-bar  date claims\n\nwere timely  filed under  FDIC's internal manual  procedures, the\n\none remaining question is  whether judicial deference is  due the\n\nFDIC   interpretation   of   subsections  1821(d)(5)(C)(ii)   and\n\n1821(d)(13) implicit in its internal manual procedures.8\n\n          The  guidelines governing deference to an administering\n\nagency's interpretation of its enabling statute are well settled:\n\n          First,  always,  is   the  question   whether\n          Congress  has directly spoken  to the precise\n          question at issue.  If the intent of Congress\n          is clear, that is the  end of the matter; for\n\n                    \n\n     8We  need  not  reconsider  our  earlier  holding  that  the\ndistrict  court  lacked   jurisdiction  over  Heno's   claim  for\ninjunctive relief,  a claim expressly barred  by   1821(j), which\nprovides in part:\n\n     Except  as provided in this  section, no court may take\n     any  action, except  at  the request  of  the Board  of\n     Directors by regulation or order, to restrain or affect\n                                                            \n     the exercise of powers  or functions of the Corporation\n                                         \n     as a conservator or a receiver.\n                                   \n\n12 U.S.C.    1821(j) (emphasis added); see  Telematics Int'l, 967\n                                                            \nF.2d at 707 (\"holding that the district court  lacks jurisdiction\nto  enjoin FDIC  when FDIC  is acting  pursuant to  its statutory\n          \npowers as receiver\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                11\n\n          the court,  as well as the  agency, must give\n          effect to the unambiguously  expressed intent\n          of Congress.   If, however, the  court deter-\n          mines Congress has not directly addressed the\n          precise question at issue, the court does not\n          simply impose  its  own construction  on  the\n          statute, as would be necessary in the absence\n                                                       \n          of an administrative interpretation.  Rather,\n                                             \n          if the  statute is silent  or ambiguous  with\n          respect to a specific issue, the question for\n          the court is  whether the agency's  answer is\n          based  on a  permissible construction  of the\n          statute.\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n467  U.S.  837,  842-43  (1984)  (emphasis  added).    Under  the\n\nstatutory   interpretation  implicit   in  its   internal  manual\n\nprocedures,   FDIC  construes  the   pivotal  statutory  bar-date\n\nexception in  subsection 1821(d)(5)(C)(ii)     \"the claimant  did\n\nnot receive notice of  the appointment of the receiver in time to\n\nfile  such claim  before [the  bar] date\"     as  permitting late\n\nfiling even by claimants who were on notice of FDIC's appointment\n                                                                 \n\nbut  could not  file their  claim because  it did  not come  into\n\nexistence  until after  the  bar date  prescribed in  subsections\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)(i) and 1821(d)(5)(C)(i).\n\n          Although we concur in FDIC's candid assessment that its\n\nproposed interpretation is  far from the most  natural reading of\n\nsubsection 1821(d)(5)(C)(ii) itself, we cannot  say that it  does\n\nnot represent  a \"permissible\" reading of  an ambiguous provision\n\nviewed in the broader context of the statute as a whole under the\n\ndeferential standard  required by Chevron.  See Chevron, 467 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  844 (agency construction  is \"permissible\" unless \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious,  or manifestly  contrary  to the  statute\") (emphasis\n                          \n\n                                12\n\nadded).  In this vein, neither we nor the parties  have found any\n\nother FIRREA provision governing  agency treatment of claims that\n                                                  \n\ndo not  arise  until more  than 90  days after  the claimant  has\n\nnotice of FDIC's appointment as receiver.  Additionally, Congress\n\nhas  delegated to  FDIC the  authority to  \"prescribe regulations\n\nregarding the allowance or disallowance of claims by the receiver\n\nand  providing  for  administrative determination  of  claims and\n\nreview  of such  determination.\"   12  U.S.C.   1821(d)(4).   The\n\nextant  FDIC  internal  manual procedures  applicable  to  Heno's\n\nclaims  comport  with  the  FDIC's interpretation  of  subsection\n\n1821(d)(5)(C)(ii), by explicitly dispensing with  any requirement\n                                           \n\n   intrinsic to the pre-bar date ACRP    that holders of post-bar\n\ndate claims  establish that  they had  no actual or  constructive\n\nnotice of FDIC's appointment.  Compare infra Appendix, Exhibits G\n                                            \n\nand 4-F with Exhibit 5-K.\n            \n\n          Further, FDIC advances sound policy grounds for afford-\n\ning it an  opportunity to  evaluate post-bar date  claims in  the\n\nfirst instance, including contract repudiation claims that do not\n\narise within  the initial  ninety-day period following  notice of\n\nits appointment as  receiver.   For one thing,  a reasonably  de-\n\nsigned and fairly administered post-bar date ACRP should optimize\n\nprospects  for expeditious  resolution  of  these claims  against\n\nfailed  banks, make  maximum  use of  FDIC's cumulative  adminis-\n\ntrative  expertise,  and minimize  burdensome  litigation  in the\n\nfederal courts.  See  Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1152  (\"Quite plainly,\n                             \n\nCongress  intended the ACRP  to provide a  streamlined method for\n\n                                13\n\nresolving most  claims against  failed institutions in  a prompt,\n\norderly fashion, without lengthy  litigation.\") (citing H.R. Rep.\n\nNo.  101-54(I),  101st  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  at  418-19  (1989)).\n\nLastly, absent a clear  signal from Congress to the  contrary, we\n\nmust credit an administering agency's reasoned interpretation  of\n\nits enabling statute.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at  843 n.11 (noting\n                                  \n\nthat judicial deference is not dependent on a determination \"that\n\nthe agency  construction was  the only one  it permissibly  could\n                                      \n\nhave  adopted to uphold the construction, or even the reading the\n\ncourt  would have reached if the question initially had arisen in\n\na judicial setting\");  see also FDIC v.

These matters must await some\n\nfuture  occasion when FDIC asserts  a jurisdictional bar to judi-\n\ncial review  under FIRREA   1821(d)(13)(D) based  on a claimant's\n\nalleged failure to comply with the internal manual procedures. \n\n          At the same  time, however, we  note that though  amply\n\ninvested  with  rulemaking  authority  to  promulgate regulations\n\nunder subsection 1821(d)(4),  FDIC has  not done so,  nor has  it\n\ntaken  reasonable steps  to forewarn  potential claimants  of the\n\nexistence  of its  internal manual  procedures for  filing \"late\"\n         \n\nclaims, thus contributing indispensably to the convoluted  travel\n\nof this case.  Cf., e.g., Lawson v.

In September 1987, Balcol began to develop\n\nthe  property,   known  as   the  Prospect   Heights  residential\n\nsubdivision,  and obtained  construction  financing through  Home\n\nNational Bank of  Milford (\"Bank\").   Heno agreed to  subordinate\n\nhis  first mortgage to the Bank's construction loan mortgage.  In\n\nreturn for the release of Heno's second mortgage lien as each lot\n\nwas  sold, Balcol and the  Bank promised to  release $19,125 from\n\nthe sale proceeds.\n\n          By April 1990, Balcol  and Prospect Heights were exper-\n\niencing financial  difficulties, and the three  principal parties\n\nentered into a recapitalization agreement.  Heno agreed to accept\n\n$5,000 (rather  than $19,125)  per lot  for releasing  his second\n\nmortgage  lien on the next nine lots  sold by Balcol.  Balcol and\n\nthe Bank agreed:   (1) to  transfer two additional  lots to  Heno\n\n(Lots 82 and  111), free and clear  of the Bank's  first mortgage\n\nliens, at the time Heno released his  second mortgage lien on the\n\nninth lot; and (2) to deposit the net proceeds from the nine lots\n\nin  escrow with  the Bank.   The  escrow monies  were to  be used\n\nexclusively for  immediate completion of roadwork  in the project\n\nandto defray Balcol's firstmortgage interest paymentsto the Bank.\n                                            \n\n                                3\n\n          Although  Balcol conveyed  Lots 82 and  111 to  Heno on\n\nMay 2, 1990, the Bank did not release its first mortgage liens on\n\nthe lots.  During April and  May 1990, seven of the nine original\n\nlots were  sold by the  Bank after Heno  had released his  second\n\nmortgage liens.   By June 1,  1990, more than  $232,000 had  been\n\ndeposited   in   escrow   with   the   Bank   pursuant   to   the\n\nrecapitalization  agreement  among  Heno, Balcol,  and  the Bank.\n\nUltimately,  the eighth  and ninth  lots were  sold, and  the net\n\nproceeds, approximating $90,000, were  deposited with FDIC.1  The\n\ncomplaint  alleges, hence  we must assume,  that $125,000  was to\n\nhave been devoted to roadwork at the project.2\n\n          On June 1,  1990, the  Bank was declared  insolvent and\n\nFDIC  was appointed receiver.  At an unspecified later date, FDIC\n\napplied  the escrow monies  toward the principal  due on Balcol's\n                                                \n\nfirst  mortgage  loan  account with  the  Bank,  contrary  to the\n\nexpress terms of the  recapitalization agreement.  Heno's counsel\n\nthereafter held discussions with FDIC, and was informed by Balcol\n\nthat FDIC  would determine, after  obtaining an appraisal  of the\n\nProspect  Heights project,  whether to  release the  Bank's first\n\nmortgage liens on  Lots 82 and  111, the two  additional lots  at\n\n                    \n\n     1The complaint  does not specify the date(s) of these sales,\nbut  the proceeds were deposited with FDIC on or about October 1,\n1990.\n\n     2At  oral  argument,  Heno's  counsel  represented  that the\nroadwork was never performed.\n\n                                4\n\nissue  on  appeal.     On  December 13,   1990,3  and  again   on\n\nFebruary 19, 1991, Heno submitted  written requests for action by\n\nFDIC, but to  no avail.4   Subsequently, FDIC  foreclosed on  the\n\nProspect Heights  subdivision, including  Lots 82  and 111.   The\n\nescrow  monies were  neither redeposited  nor applied  toward the\n\npurposes agreed upon under the recapitalization agreement.\n\n          On October 18,  1991, Heno initiated the present action\n\nto  enjoin FDIC's sale  of Lots  82 and 111  and to compel  it to\n\nredeposit  the escrow  monies previously  misapplied to  Balcol's\n\nfirst  mortgage  with  the  Bank.    The  complaint  demanded  an\n\nequitable  accounting  of  the  escrow  monies, and  compensatory\n\n                    \n\n     3Heno's December 13 letter specifically requested release of\nthe Bank's  first mortgage liens  on Lots  82 and 111  and served\n\"notice of [Heno's] contingent interest in [the escrow account].\"\nThe letter went on to say:\n\n     Heno  should receive  either the  lot releases  or that\n     portion  of  the  escrow account  attributable  to  his\n     participation in the agreement.  Under well established\n                                                            \n     fiduciary and equitable principles,  if the FDIC is not\n                                                            \n     going to honor the purposes of the escrow account, that\n                                                            \n     portion  of the escrow  account attributable  to Heno's\n                                                            \n     participation should  be returned to him,  and not used\n                                                            \n     by the Receiver to reduce Balcol's obligation.\n                                                  \n\n(Emphasis  added.)     Heno's  complaint  demands   an  equitable\naccounting  of  the escrow  monies,  and,  accordingly, does  not\nspecify  the  exact  amount  claimed.    However,  were  Heno  to\nestablish a  repudiation  of the  recapitalization agreement,  he\ncould  be expected to assert  a claim for  the difference between\nthe  $19,125 originally  agreed  upon, and  the  $5,000 he  later\nagreed to accept under the recapitalization agreement for releas-\ning his second mortgage liens on the nine lots sold by Balcol (or\napproximately $127,000).\n\n     4The February 19, 1991, letter outlines, among other things,\nthe evidence relating to Heno's interest in the escrow monies and\ncertain  subdivision  lots,  and  makes  reference  to additional\nletters not included in the appellate record.\n\n                                5\n\nrelief for the loss  occasioned by FDIC's refusal to  release the\n\nBank's first  mortgage liens on Lots  82 and 111.   FDIC moved to\n\ndismiss the  claim for compensatory  relief pursuant  to Fed.  R.\n\nCiv. 12(b)(1), and  the claim for  injunctive relief pursuant  to\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   The  district court decided  that it\n\nlacked jurisdiction to consider the claim for compensatory relief\n\nby virtue  of 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D)(i),  and that injunctive\n\nrelief was precluded by 12 U.S.C.   1821(j).\n\nB.

Subsections\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)  and (C) require FDIC to publish and mail notice of\n\nliquidation to  \"any creditor  shown on the  institution's books\"\n\nand to allow at least ninety days for filing \"claims.\"  12 U.S.C.\n\n  1821(d)(3)(B),  (C).

Because\n\nHeno    no doubt like  many others who assert claims  arising out\n\nof executory  contracts  with a  failed  bank     concededly  had\n\nactual notice  of FDIC's appointment,  but held no  assertable or\n                                                  \n\nprovable  \"claim\" until  after the bar  date, the  original panel\n                              \n\nopinion  reasoned  that  the  ACRP  established under  subsection\n\n1821(d)  rationally  could not  have  been  intended to  preclude\n\njudicial review of  post-receivership \"claims\" which  arise after\n                                                                 \n\nthe expiration  of the 90-day administrative-claim filing period.\n\nRather, inasmuch as FDIC received two post-bar date requests from\n\nHeno that it either affirm or repudiate the alleged reaffirmation\n\nagreement   within  a   \"reasonable  period   following  [FDIC's]\n\nappointment,\" see 12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(2); supra notes 3 and 4, we\n                                               \n\nheld Heno's claim for contract repudiation subject instead to the\n\nmore flexible  time constraints established in  FIRREA   1821(e).\n\nSee,  e.g., Ceguerra v.

If the intent of Congress\n          is clear, that is the  end of the matter; for\n\n                    \n\n     8We  need  not  reconsider  our  earlier  holding  that  the\ndistrict  court  lacked   jurisdiction  over  Heno's   claim  for\ninjunctive relief,  a claim expressly barred  by   1821(j), which\nprovides in part:\n\n     Except  as provided in this  section, no court may take\n     any  action, except  at  the request  of  the Board  of\n     Directors by regulation or order, to restrain or affect\n                                                            \n     the exercise of powers  or functions of the Corporation\n                                         \n     as a conservator or a receiver.\n                                   \n\n12 U.S.C.    1821(j) (emphasis added); see  Telematics Int'l, 967\n                                                            \nF.2d at 707 (\"holding that the district court  lacks jurisdiction\nto  enjoin FDIC  when FDIC  is acting  pursuant to  its statutory\n          \npowers as receiver\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                11\n\n          the court,  as well as the  agency, must give\n          effect to the unambiguously  expressed intent\n          of Congress.   If, however, the  court deter-\n          mines Congress has not directly addressed the\n          precise question at issue, the court does not\n          simply impose  its  own construction  on  the\n          statute, as would be necessary in the absence\n                                                       \n          of an administrative interpretation.

Under  the\n\nstatutory   interpretation  implicit   in  its   internal  manual\n\nprocedures,   FDIC  construes  the   pivotal  statutory  bar-date\n\nexception in  subsection 1821(d)(5)(C)(ii)     \"the claimant  did\n\nnot receive notice of  the appointment of the receiver in time to\n\nfile  such claim  before [the  bar] date\"     as  permitting late\n\nfiling even by claimants who were on notice of FDIC's appointment\n                                                                 \n\nbut  could not  file their  claim because  it did  not come  into\n\nexistence  until after  the  bar date  prescribed in  subsections\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)(i) and 1821(d)(5)(C)(i).\n\n          Although we concur in FDIC's candid assessment that its\n\nproposed interpretation is  far from the most  natural reading of\n\nsubsection 1821(d)(5)(C)(ii) itself, we cannot  say that it  does\n\nnot represent  a \"permissible\" reading of  an ambiguous provision\n\nviewed in the broader context of the statute as a whole under the\n\ndeferential standard  required by Chevron.  See Chevron, 467 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  844 (agency construction  is \"permissible\" unless \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious,  or manifestly  contrary  to the  statute\") (emphasis\n                          \n\n                                12\n\nadded).  In this vein, neither we nor the parties  have found any\n\nother FIRREA provision governing  agency treatment of claims that\n                                                  \n\ndo not  arise  until more  than 90  days after  the claimant  has\n\nnotice of FDIC's appointment as receiver.  Additionally, Congress\n\nhas  delegated to  FDIC the  authority to  \"prescribe regulations\n\nregarding the allowance or disallowance of claims by the receiver\n\nand  providing  for  administrative determination  of  claims and\n\nreview  of such  determination.\"   12  U.S.C.   1821(d)(4).   The\n\nextant  FDIC  internal  manual procedures  applicable  to  Heno's\n\nclaims  comport  with  the  FDIC's interpretation  of  subsection\n\n1821(d)(5)(C)(ii), by explicitly dispensing with  any requirement\n                                           \n\n   intrinsic to the pre-bar date ACRP    that holders of post-bar\n\ndate claims  establish that  they had  no actual or  constructive\n\nnotice of FDIC's appointment.  Compare infra Appendix, Exhibits G\n                                            \n\nand 4-F with Exhibit 5-K.\n            \n\n          Further, FDIC advances sound policy grounds for afford-\n\ning it an  opportunity to  evaluate post-bar date  claims in  the\n\nfirst instance, including contract repudiation claims that do not\n\narise within  the initial  ninety-day period following  notice of\n\nits appointment as  receiver.   For one thing,  a reasonably  de-\n\nsigned and fairly administered post-bar date ACRP should optimize\n\nprospects  for expeditious  resolution  of  these claims  against\n\nfailed  banks, make  maximum  use of  FDIC's cumulative  adminis-\n\ntrative  expertise,  and minimize  burdensome  litigation  in the\n\nfederal courts.  See  Marquis, 965 F.2d at 1152  (\"Quite plainly,\n                             \n\nCongress  intended the ACRP  to provide a  streamlined method for\n\n                                13\n\nresolving most  claims against  failed institutions in  a prompt,\n\norderly fashion, without lengthy  litigation.\") (citing H.R.
