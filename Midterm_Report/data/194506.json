This appeal  requires us to\n                                   \n\ndelve  into the  tort law  of Puerto  Rico.   Appellant  sued the\n\nUnited  States pursuant to the Federal  Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n\n28 U.S.C.   2671 et seq., for damages arising out  of a slip-and-\n                        \n\nfall accident.    The district  court judge  dismissed the  suit,\n\nfinding that appellant failed to establish any negligence leading\n\nto  the  accident.   Appellant contends  that the  district court\n\njudge  incorrectly construed  Puerto Rico  law in  requiring that\n\nshowing.  We disagree with appellant and thus affirm.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          The facts are rather simple.  Appellant was shopping at\n\nthe  army commissary in Fort Buchanan,  Puerto Rico.  Approaching\n\nthe checkout counter with her groceries, she slipped on some milk\n\nand sustained  serious  injuries.   Several  people came  to  her\n\nassistance,  including  a  commissary  employee.    According  to\n\nappellant, the employee  indicated that she  knew about the  milk\n\nprior to the accident and expressed regret at not  cleaning it up\n\nearlier.     The  employee,  Ms.  Toledo,   denies  making  these\n\nstatements or to having any knowledge  of the spilt milk prior to\n\nthe accident.  \n\n          Appellant filed an FTCA  claim against United States in\n\nthe  District  Court of  Puerto Rico.   As  the FTCA  directs the\n\ndistrict court  to  employ local  tort  law, the  district  court\n\napplied the laws of Puerto Rico.    The district court judge thus\n\nfound that appellant  was a  business invitee  at the  commissary\n\nbecause she was a  shopper.  The district court  judge also found\n\n                               -2-\n\nthat  local   law  required  appellant  to   establish  that  the\n\ncommissary was  negligent before  the commissary could  be liable\n\nfor her injuries.  Specifically, the district court judge imposed\n\nupon the plaintiff the burden of showing that the store owner had\n\nactual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition and time\n\nto cure it.\n\n          After hearing  from the  witnesses at the  bench trial,\n\nthe district  court judge determined that  there was insufficient\n\nevidence  to show  negligence by  the commissary.   The  district\n\ncourt  judge found the testimony of Ms. Toledo more credible than\n\nthe testimony of appellant  as to whether the commissary  knew of\n\nthe milk.   Lacking such  evidence, the district  court dismissed\n\nappellant's claim.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          The  issue in  this  case is  whether  Puerto Rico  law\n\nimposes a burden upon business invitees  who suffered a slip-and-\n\nfall  to  show  that the  store  owner  possessed  notice and  an\n\nopportunity to cure.  Puerto  Rico law is unclear on  this point.\n\nWe therefore trace the  development of Puerto Rico law  to divine\n\nthe  result that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would have reached\n\nin this case.  \n\n          Our analysis  begins with  the Puerto Rico  civil code.\n\nSection 5141 provides that \"[a] person who by an act or  omission\n\ncauses  damage to  another through  fault or negligence  shall be\n\nobliged to repair the  damage so done.  Concurrent  imprudence of\n\nthe party aggrieved does not exempt from liability, but entails a\n\n                               -3-\n\nreduction of  the indemnity.\"   P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  31,    5141\n\n(1991).   The statute does not define  \"fault or negligence\" in a\n\nbusiness  invitee  slip-and-fall situation,  but the  Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has addressed this issue on several occasions.  The\n\nCourt's pronouncements, however, have  been inconsistent.  We are\n\nrequired to analyze the cases in an attempt to  reach the correct\n\nresult in this case.  We proceed in chronological order.\n\n          We  begin with Guti rrez v. Bahr, 78 D.P.R. 473, 474-75\n                                          \n\n(1955), in which  a man was injured  in a watch repair  shop by a\n\nfan.    From  these  facts  the Court  set  forth  the  two basic\n\nprinciples  behind     5141.     First,  as  a  \"universal  legal\n\nprinciple,\"  store owners  must  maintain their  store in  a safe\n                               \n\ncondition for any person induced to enter.  Id. at  474.  Second,\n                                               \n\nthe  duty only extends  to acts or omissions  caused by \"fault or\n\nnegligence.\"  Id.   In Guti rrez, the Court found  that the store\n                                \n\nowner  was negligent in maintaining the fan, as the fan presented\n\nan unreasonable  risk  of danger  to  invitees.   While  shedding\n\nlittle   light  on  the   instant  slip-and-fall  situation,  the\n\nunderpinning  of     5141  set  forth  in  Guti rrez  has  guided\n                                                    \n\nsubsequent decisions on business invitee torts by the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt.  \n\n          The  Court followed  the  instruction  of Guti rrez  in\n                                                             \n\nGoose v. Hilton Hotels,  79 D.P.R. 523  (1956).  In Goose,  hotel\n                                                         \n\nguests  wearing bathing  suits  were required  to  use a  certain\n\nelevator  and stairway to go to the  pool.  The stairway was wide\n\nand slippery, but equipped with only one railing.  Because of the\n\n                               -4-\n\nstairway's  condition, a hotel guest fell.  Focussing on the fact\n\nthat the stairs should  have had more than one railing, the Court\n\nfound the  stairway unreasonably and forseeably  dangerous.  From\n\nthis  finding,  the Court  determined  that  the hotel  possessed\n\nconstructive knowledge of the  danger.  As the requirements  of  \n\n5141 were  satisfied, the Court imposed liability upon the hotel.\n\nThe  Court also  noted that  store customers  \"generally expect[]\n\nthat the aisles and passage ways  open to customers are free from\n\n. . . slippery spots.\"  Id. at 530 n.2.\n                           \n\n          In Aponte v. Mel ndez, 87 P.R.R. 619 (1963), the  Court\n                               \n\nrevised its views on  the requirements of   5141 and  the lessons\n\nof Goose.  There, a shopper at  a food store slipped on a  banana\n        \n\npeel.    The  shopper sued  under     5141, but  the  trial Court\n\nrejected her claim because she failed to show  that the store had\n\nconstructive  knowledge of  the banana  peel on  the floor.   The\n\nPuerto  Rico Supreme  Court reversed,  however, finding  that the\n\ndefense  of a lack of constructive  knowledge was not viable in  \n\n5141  cases.   The  Court cited  Goose  for the  proposition that\n                                      \n\nshopowners must keep public areas free of \"slippery spots,\" while\n\nignoring the language in  Goose concerning actual or constructive\n                               \n\nknowledge. \n\n          By doing  away with  the knowledge  element of    5141,\n\nAponte imposed a strict  liability or, as the Puerto  Rico courts\n      \n\nsometimes say, a res ipsa loquitur standard upon store owners, in\n                                  \n\nwhich a dangerous condition in the store led to a  per se finding\n\nof negligence.  Cf.  Dopico-Fern ndez v. Grand Union Supermarket,\n                                                                \n\n                               -5-\n\n841 F.2d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Aponte and Goose:  \"[t]he\n                                                        \n\nclear rule in Puerto Rico is that an owner of an establishment is\n\npotentially  liable for all injuries occurring  in areas where he\n                           \n\nhas retained  control\") (emphasis  added).   In the cases  before\n\nAponte, the Court  discussed    5141 in terms  of negligence;  in\n      \n\nAponte the Court switched to res ipsa loquitur liability.\n                                              \n\n          The Puerto  Rico Supreme Court followed the instruction\n\nof the Aponte case in  a line of cases imposing liability  on the\n             \n\nstore  owner  when  a  dangerous  condition  existed,  without  a\n\nspecific  finding  of knowledge  of  the condition.    See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nFeliciano v. Escuela  de Enfermeras,  94 P.R.R. 509  (1967).   In\n                                   \n\nFeliciano,  plaintiff alleged that some water  caused her to slip\n         \n\non  defendant's  steps.     The  Court   disregarded  plaintiff's\n\nallegation, but  imposed liability anyway because  even when dry,\n\nthe steps were smooth  and \"at times\" slippery.

Supermercados Amigo, Inc., 106 D.P.R. 657 (1977) (store owners\n                            \n\nmust keep inside of their stores in safe condition,  but they owe\n\nlower level of duty as to parking lots).\n\n          Notably, in the Feliciano  case four justices joined in\n                                   \n\na  vigorous  dissent.1   The  dissenters  argued that  the  Court\n\nimposed liability  without any showing of  actual or constructive\n\nknowledge  of  water, or  any  other  dangerous condition,  which\n\ncaused plaintiff  to  slip.   The dissenters  concluded that  the\n\nmajority had imposed a res ipsa loquitur standard on the property\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n1  A total of nine Justices  sat on the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\nwhen Feliciano was decided.\n              \n\n                               -6-\n\nowner:  because a slip-and-fall occurred, the Court presumed that\n\nthe owner  was negligent.   The  dissenters found  the majority's\n\nholding contrary to the weight of Puerto Rico negligence law, but\n\nfailed to acknowledge Aponte.\n                            \n\n          In seeming response to the  concerns of the dissent  in\n\nFeliciano,  the  Court   incorporated  language  of   actual  and\n         \n\nconstructive knowledge  in its  opinion in Cotto  v. Consolidated\n                                                                 \n\nMutual Insurance Co., 116 D.P.R. 644 (1985).  In Cotto, a shopper\n                                                      \n\nfell while she was walking to an escalator at a department store.\n\nShe sued,  alleging that  the floor was  slippery.  She  did not,\n\nhowever, allege that any  foreign matter on the floor  caused the\n\nslipperiness.  \n\n          The  Court  disallowed  her  claim,  finding  her  bare\n\nallegation  that the  floor was  slippery insufficient  to impose\n\nliability.  The Court  stated that its previous cases,  including\n\nGuti rrez, Goose, and Aponte, \"imposed liability when [the cases]\n                            \n\ninvolved  existing  dangerous  conditions  within   the  business\n                                         \n\npremises in question,  which conditions were known  to the owners\n                                                                 \n\nor should have been known to them.\"  Id. at 650.  Thus, actual or\n                                        \n\nconstructive knowledge of the hazard was an element of the tort. \n\n          The  Court went on, however, to base its holding on the\n\nlack of a  dangerous condition in  the store.   This holding  was\n\nconsistent  with the Aponte line  of cases, in  which the inquiry\n                           \n\nfocussed  on the existence of  a dangerous condition.   The Cotto\n                                                                 \n\nlanguage on actual or constructive knowledge,  on the other hand,\n\nwas  not consistent with those  cases.  Indeed,  a cite to Aponte\n                                                                 \n\n                               -7-\n\nfor the proposition that knowledge of the hazard is an element of\n\nthe tort was incorrect.\n\n          This  leaves  us  in  the   uncomfortable  position  of\n\nchoosing whether to  follow the  Aponte line of  cases, in  which\n                                       \n\nactual or constructive knowledge  is not an element of  the tort,\n\nor  whether to follow Cotto and  the cases prior to Aponte, under\n                                                          \n\nwhich such knowledge is an element of the tort.\n\n          We believe that Cotto and the cases prior to Aponte are\n                                                             \n\nmore consistent with the language of   5141, and thus contain the\n\ncorrect  result in this case.  Those  cases give effect to all of\n\nthe language  of the  statute, including the  language concerning\n\nfault and  negligence.    In  contrast, Aponte  and  its  progeny\n                                              \n\nvirtually  deleted those  words from  the statute.   Furthermore,\n\nCotto, as the most recent  case, provides the most  authoritative\n     \n\ndescription of the current state of  the law.  To the extent that\n\nits language is inconsistent  with Aponte and its  progeny, Cotto\n                                                                 \n\nrepresents an  evolving understanding  of   5141.   To  disregard\n\nCotto thus would require us to select potentially outdated law.\n     \n\n          As  we find Cotto to  reflect the current  state of the\n                           \n\nlaw in  Puerto Rico,  we  agree with  the district  court on  the\n\nresult of this  case.  Section 5141  requires, as an  element, an\n\naffirmative  showing  by the  plaintiff  that  the defendant  was\n\nnegligent.  This showing, in turn, requires  a demonstration that\n\nthe defendant  has either actual  or constructive knowledge  of a\n\ndangerous  condition.    As the  plaintiff  failed  to meet  this\n\nburden, the district court properly dismissed the case.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -9-\n",

This appeal  requires us to\n                                   \n\ndelve  into the  tort law  of Puerto  Rico.   Appellant  sued the\n\nUnited  States pursuant to the Federal  Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n\n28 U.S.C.   2671 et seq., for damages arising out  of a slip-and-\n                        \n\nfall accident.    The district  court judge  dismissed the  suit,\n\nfinding that appellant failed to establish any negligence leading\n\nto  the  accident.   Appellant contends  that the  district court\n\njudge  incorrectly construed  Puerto Rico  law in  requiring that\n\nshowing.  We disagree with appellant and thus affirm.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          The facts are rather simple.  Appellant was shopping at\n\nthe  army commissary in Fort Buchanan,  Puerto Rico.  Approaching\n\nthe checkout counter with her groceries, she slipped on some milk\n\nand sustained  serious  injuries.   Several  people came  to  her\n\nassistance,  including  a  commissary  employee.    According  to\n\nappellant, the employee  indicated that she  knew about the  milk\n\nprior to the accident and expressed regret at not  cleaning it up\n\nearlier.     The  employee,  Ms.  Toledo,   denies  making  these\n\nstatements or to having any knowledge  of the spilt milk prior to\n\nthe accident.  \n\n          Appellant filed an FTCA  claim against United States in\n\nthe  District  Court of  Puerto Rico.   As  the FTCA  directs the\n\ndistrict court  to  employ local  tort  law, the  district  court\n\napplied the laws of Puerto Rico.    The district court judge thus\n\nfound that appellant  was a  business invitee  at the  commissary\n\nbecause she was a  shopper.  The district court  judge also found\n\n                               -2-\n\nthat  local   law  required  appellant  to   establish  that  the\n\ncommissary was  negligent before  the commissary could  be liable\n\nfor her injuries.  Specifically, the district court judge imposed\n\nupon the plaintiff the burden of showing that the store owner had\n\nactual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition and time\n\nto cure it.\n\n          After hearing  from the  witnesses at the  bench trial,\n\nthe district  court judge determined that  there was insufficient\n\nevidence  to show  negligence by  the commissary.   The  district\n\ncourt  judge found the testimony of Ms. Toledo more credible than\n\nthe testimony of appellant  as to whether the commissary  knew of\n\nthe milk.   Lacking such  evidence, the district  court dismissed\n\nappellant's claim.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          The  issue in  this  case is  whether  Puerto Rico  law\n\nimposes a burden upon business invitees  who suffered a slip-and-\n\nfall  to  show  that the  store  owner  possessed  notice and  an\n\nopportunity to cure.  Puerto  Rico law is unclear on  this point.\n\nWe therefore trace the  development of Puerto Rico law  to divine\n\nthe  result that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would have reached\n\nin this case.  \n\n          Our analysis  begins with  the Puerto Rico  civil code.\n\nSection 5141 provides that \"[a] person who by an act or  omission\n\ncauses  damage to  another through  fault or negligence  shall be\n\nobliged to repair the  damage so done.  Concurrent  imprudence of\n\nthe party aggrieved does not exempt from liability, but entails a\n\n                               -3-\n\nreduction of  the indemnity.\"   P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  31,    5141\n\n(1991).   The statute does not define  \"fault or negligence\" in a\n\nbusiness  invitee  slip-and-fall situation,  but the  Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court has addressed this issue on several occasions.  The\n\nCourt's pronouncements, however, have  been inconsistent.  We are\n\nrequired to analyze the cases in an attempt to  reach the correct\n\nresult in this case.  We proceed in chronological order.\n\n          We  begin with Guti rrez v. Bahr, 78 D.P.R. 473, 474-75\n                                          \n\n(1955), in which  a man was injured  in a watch repair  shop by a\n\nfan.    From  these  facts  the Court  set  forth  the  two basic\n\nprinciples  behind     5141.     First,  as  a  \"universal  legal\n\nprinciple,\"  store owners  must  maintain their  store in  a safe\n                               \n\ncondition for any person induced to enter.  Id. at  474.  Second,\n                                               \n\nthe  duty only extends  to acts or omissions  caused by \"fault or\n\nnegligence.\"  Id.   In Guti rrez, the Court found  that the store\n                                \n\nowner  was negligent in maintaining the fan, as the fan presented\n\nan unreasonable  risk  of danger  to  invitees.   While  shedding\n\nlittle   light  on  the   instant  slip-and-fall  situation,  the\n\nunderpinning  of     5141  set  forth  in  Guti rrez  has  guided\n                                                    \n\nsubsequent decisions on business invitee torts by the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt.  \n\n          The  Court followed  the  instruction  of Guti rrez  in\n                                                             \n\nGoose v. Hilton Hotels,  79 D.P.R. 523  (1956).  In Goose,  hotel\n                                                         \n\nguests  wearing bathing  suits  were required  to  use a  certain\n\nelevator  and stairway to go to the  pool.  The stairway was wide\n\nand slippery, but equipped with only one railing.  Because of the\n\n                               -4-\n\nstairway's  condition, a hotel guest fell.  Focussing on the fact\n\nthat the stairs should  have had more than one railing, the Court\n\nfound the  stairway unreasonably and forseeably  dangerous.  From\n\nthis  finding,  the Court  determined  that  the hotel  possessed\n\nconstructive knowledge of the  danger.  As the requirements  of  \n\n5141 were  satisfied, the Court imposed liability upon the hotel.\n\nThe  Court also  noted that  store customers  \"generally expect[]\n\nthat the aisles and passage ways  open to customers are free from\n\n. . . slippery spots.\"  Id. at 530 n.2.\n                           \n\n          In Aponte v. Mel ndez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), the  Court\n                               \n\nrevised its views on  the requirements of   5141 and  the lessons\n\nof Goose.  There, a shopper at  a food store slipped on a  banana\n        \n\npeel.    The  shopper sued  under     5141, but  the  trial Court\n\nrejected her claim because she failed to show  that the store had\n\nconstructive  knowledge of  the banana  peel on  the floor.   The\n\nPuerto  Rico Supreme  Court reversed,  however, finding  that the\n\ndefense  of a lack of constructive  knowledge was not viable in  \n\n5141  cases.   The  Court cited  Goose  for the  proposition that\n                                      \n\nshopowners must keep public areas free of \"slippery spots,\" while\n\nignoring the language in  Goose concerning actual or constructive\n                               \n\nknowledge. \n\n          By doing  away with  the knowledge  element of    5141,\n\nAponte imposed a strict  liability or, as the Puerto  Rico courts\n      \n\nsometimes say, a res ipsa loquitur standard upon store owners, in\n                                  \n\nwhich a dangerous condition in the store led to a  per se finding\n\nof negligence.  Cf.  Dopico-Fern ndez v. Grand Union Supermarket,\n                                                                \n\n                               -5-\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502479\"><a href=\"/opinion/502479/josefa-dopico-fernandez-v-grand-union-supermarket/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Aponte and Goose:  \"[t]he\n                                                        \n\nclear rule in Puerto Rico is that an owner of an establishment is\n\npotentially  liable for all injuries occurring  in areas where he\n                           \n\nhas retained  control\") (emphasis  added).   In the cases  before\n\nAponte, the Court  discussed    5141 in terms  of negligence;  in\n      \n\nAponte the Court switched to res ipsa loquitur liability.\n                                              \n\n          The Puerto  Rico Supreme Court followed the instruction\n\nof the Aponte case in  a line of cases imposing liability  on the\n             \n\nstore  owner  when  a  dangerous  condition  existed,  without  a\n\nspecific  finding  of knowledge  of  the condition.    See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nFeliciano v.

In\n                                   \n\nFeliciano,  plaintiff alleged that some water  caused her to slip\n         \n\non  defendant's  steps.     The  Court   disregarded  plaintiff's\n\nallegation, but  imposed liability anyway because  even when dry,\n\nthe steps were smooth  and \"at times\" slippery.

Supermercados Amigo, Inc., 106 D.P.R. 657 (1977) (store owners\n                            \n\nmust keep inside of their stores in safe condition,  but they owe\n\nlower level of duty as to parking lots).\n\n          Notably, in the Feliciano  case four justices joined in\n                                   \n\na  vigorous  dissent.1   The  dissenters  argued that  the  Court\n\nimposed liability  without any showing of  actual or constructive\n\nknowledge  of  water, or  any  other  dangerous condition,  which\n\ncaused plaintiff  to  slip.   The dissenters  concluded that  the\n\nmajority had imposed a res ipsa loquitur standard on the property\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n1  A total of nine Justices  sat on the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\nwhen Feliciano was decided.\n              \n\n                               -6-\n\nowner:  because a slip-and-fall occurred, the Court presumed that\n\nthe owner  was negligent.   The  dissenters found  the majority's\n\nholding contrary to the weight of Puerto Rico negligence law, but\n\nfailed to acknowledge Aponte.\n                            \n\n          In seeming response to the  concerns of the dissent  in\n\nFeliciano,  the  Court   incorporated  language  of   actual  and\n         \n\nconstructive knowledge  in its  opinion in Cotto  v. Consolidated\n                                                                 \n\nMutual Insurance Co., 116 D.P.R. 644 (1985).  In Cotto, a shopper\n                                                      \n\nfell while she was walking to an escalator at a department store.\n\nShe sued,  alleging that  the floor was  slippery.  She  did not,\n\nhowever, allege that any  foreign matter on the floor  caused the\n\nslipperiness.  \n\n          The  Court  disallowed  her  claim,  finding  her  bare\n\nallegation  that the  floor was  slippery insufficient  to impose\n\nliability.  The Court  stated that its previous cases,  including\n\nGuti rrez, Goose, and Aponte, \"imposed liability when [the cases]\n                            \n\ninvolved  existing  dangerous  conditions  within   the  business\n                                         \n\npremises in question,  which conditions were known  to the owners\n                                                                 \n\nor should have been known to them.\"  Id. at 650.  Thus, actual or\n                                        \n\nconstructive knowledge of the hazard was an element of the tort. \n\n          The  Court went on, however, to base its holding on the\n\nlack of a  dangerous condition in  the store.   This holding  was\n\nconsistent  with the Aponte line  of cases, in  which the inquiry\n                           \n\nfocussed  on the existence of  a dangerous condition.   The Cotto\n                                                                 \n\nlanguage on actual or constructive knowledge,  on the other hand,\n\nwas  not consistent with those  cases.  Indeed,  a cite to Aponte\n                                                                 \n\n                               -7-\n\nfor the proposition that knowledge of the hazard is an element of\n\nthe tort was incorrect.\n\n          This  leaves  us  in  the   uncomfortable  position  of\n\nchoosing whether to  follow the  Aponte line of  cases, in  which\n                                       \n\nactual or constructive knowledge  is not an element of  the tort,\n\nor  whether to follow Cotto and  the cases prior to Aponte, under\n                                                          \n\nwhich such knowledge is an element of the tort.\n\n          We believe that Cotto and the cases prior to Aponte are\n                                                             \n\nmore consistent with the language of   5141, and thus contain the\n\ncorrect  result in this case.  Those  cases give effect to all of\n\nthe language  of the  statute, including the  language concerning\n\nfault and  negligence.    In  contrast, Aponte  and  its  progeny\n                                              \n\nvirtually  deleted those  words from  the statute.   Furthermore,\n\nCotto, as the most recent  case, provides the most  authoritative\n     \n\ndescription of the current state of  the law.  To the extent that\n\nits language is inconsistent  with Aponte and its  progeny, Cotto\n                                                                 \n\nrepresents an  evolving understanding  of   5141.   To  disregard\n\nCotto thus would require us to select potentially outdated law.\n     \n\n          As  we find Cotto to  reflect the current  state of the\n                           \n\nlaw in  Puerto Rico,  we  agree with  the district  court on  the\n\nresult of this  case.  Section 5141  requires, as an  element, an\n\naffirmative  showing  by the  plaintiff  that  the defendant  was\n\nnegligent.  This showing, in turn, requires  a demonstration that\n\nthe defendant  has either actual  or constructive knowledge  of a\n\ndangerous  condition.    As the  plaintiff  failed  to meet  this\n\nburden, the district court properly dismissed the case.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -9-\n</pre>",
