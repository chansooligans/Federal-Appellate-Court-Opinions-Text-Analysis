This  appeal  requires  us to\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nclarify a sentencing court's obligations in resolving evidentiary\n\ndisputes over  drug quantity.   Because  we understand the  court\n\nbelow to have  fashioned a per se rule  giving controlling effect\n                                 \n\nto  trial testimony,  come what  may, and  because the  court, in\n\nfidelity to  its self-hewn  rule, did  not meaningfully  consider\n\nconflicting  evidence  proffered   by  the  defense,   we  vacate\n\nappellant's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  bifurcate our  account  of  what transpired  below,\n\nfirst  elucidating  the  sequence of  relevant  events,  and then\n\nplacing an interpretive gloss on those events.\n\n                   A.  The Sequence of Events.\n                                             \n\n          A jury found defendant-appellant James Tavano guilty of\n\nconspiring  to possess  cocaine  with  intent  to  distribute  in\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.    846  (1988).   Dissatisfied with  the\n\noutcome,  appellant engaged new  counsel.  The  probation officer\n\nproceeded to compile  the presentence  investigation report  (PSI\n\nReport).\n\n          On  February 11,  1993,  the PSI  Report  emerged.   It\n\nadopted the prosecution's  version of the crime,  concluding that\n\nappellant's relevant conduct encompassed between five and fifteen\n\nkilograms of  cocaine.  Appellant's  new lawyer objected  to this\n\nconclusion and, on March 15, 1993, sent a letter to the probation\n\nofficer spelling out discrepant representations in the grand jury\n\n                                2\n\ntestimony   concerning  the   size  and   frequency   of  certain\n\ntransactions.1  The  attorney argued that the  proffered evidence\n\ncast the trial testimony into disrepute and, moreover, giving the\n\nproffered  evidence  its   due,  appellant  could  not   be  held\n\nresponsible  for  more  than  three  and  one-half  kilograms  of\n\ncocaine.2  The prosecutor promptly fired  off a detailed rebuttal\n\nletter under date of  April 9, 1993.   The probation officer,  in\n\nturn,  attached a brief addendum to the PSI Report, stating:\n\n          After review  of the  materials submitted  by\n          both the  defense  and  the  government,  the\n          probation office feels  that the calculations\n          originally submitted in the  [PSI] Report are\n          correct and accurately reflect the amount  of\n          cocaine for which the  defendant can be  held\n          accountable.  The report is unchanged.\n\n          The district  court convened a  disposition hearing one\n\nweek  later.    Here follows,  at  length,  the  crucial exchange\n\nbetween defense counsel and the judge:\n\n            COUNSEL:   I'd  like to  say  that I  think\n          perhaps  the thing to do  in this case is not\n          to sentence,  but perhaps take some  time and\n          have  one of your clerks maybe go through [my\n          March 15] submission.\n\n            JUDGE:  No.  No.  I don't want  to do that.\n\n                    \n\n     1By  and  large,  this testimony  originated  from  the same\nsources,  and referred  to the  same transactions,  as  the trial\ntestimony  on which  the probation  officer  and the  prosecution\nrelied.\n\n     2The prize at stake in  the battle over drug quantity  is no\nmere  bagatelle.   If  five  or  more  kilograms of  cocaine  are\nproperly attributable to  Tavano, he  is subject  to a  mandatory\nminimum  prison   term   of   ten   years,  see   21   U.S.C.    \n                                               \n841(b)(1)(A)(ii), as opposed  to a mandatory minimum  sentence of\nfive years  if his  alternative calculation  is credited, see  21\n                                                             \nU.S.C.     841(b)(1)(B)(ii).   Tavano's  base  offense  level and\nguideline sentencing range are similarly affected.\n\n                                3\n\n          It is not the kind of thing I would do.\n\n               I have just read, I think carefully, the\n          government's statement,  which is  helpful in\n          refreshing   my  recollection   as  to   what\n          happened at the  trial.  You weren't  here at\n          the   trial,  although   you  did   read  the\n          transcript, and I think what [the prosecutor]\n          says is accurate.\n\n            COUNSEL:   Your Honor, it  may be  accurate\n          but  \n\n            JUDGE:  I  don't think that I can go beyond\n          that.   In  other words,  I  think what  your\n          point is,  is that  if I  consider the  grand\n          jury   testimony,   if   I   consider   prior\n          inconsistent  statements, I  can  come out  a\n          different way, but I don't think that is what\n          I do.\n\n               It seems people come  to court and  they\n          testify.   This  is the  dough  issue, so  to\n          speak,  as you  well  know,  and  it  is  the\n          evidence  that  is  presented at  trial  that\n          controls; and, even in  the most conservative\n          efforts  to  try  to make  sure  there  is no\n          double charging against your client, he comes\n          out well above the amount that is necessary.\n\n            COUNSEL:  I don't think that is true.\n\n            JUDGE:  I am not saying I am right.  I hope\n          I am right.\n\n            COUNSEL:  . . . I say that you have a right\n          to look at both of these testimonies and make\n          the decision as to what the weight was.\n\n                        *       *       *\n\n            JUDGE:  . . .  You didn't try the case, and\n          I didn't try the case.   I presided, and  you\n          were somewhere  else.   But I  do think  that\n          what should  control is the evidence  that is\n          presented at trial.  That is where everything\n          gets shaken down.\n\n               I   think   that    [the   prosecutor's]\n          statement  of  what  took place  at  trial is\n          reasonably presented  in  this  April 9, 1993\n          submission .  . .;  and for  purposes of  the\n\n                                4\n\n          record,  I  will  adopt his  statement  as my\n          findings.   If I  have made  a mistake,  then\n          that gives you  a very clear shot  on appeal.\n          That is what I am trying to do.\n\n          Following this exchange, the court selected a guideline\n\nsentencing  range  on the  basis  of its  finding  that appellant\n\nhandled  between five  and  fifteen  kilograms  of  cocaine,  and\n\nsentenced appellant  to a prison term of 121 months (the nadir of\n\nthe chosen range),  capped by five  years of supervised  release.\n\nOn the order  of judgment form, the court  indicated its adoption\n\nof the findings suggested in the PSI Report.  This appeal ensued.\n\n             B.  Interpreting the Sequence of Events.\n                                                    \n\n          Before appellate review can proceed, it is necessary to\n\nclarify exactly what  the district judge did and  exactly what he\n\ndid not  do.  We are  guided in this  endeavor by the record    a\n\nrecord  that flavors the judge's words and, concomitantly, offers\n\ninsights into his thinking.\n\n          Appellant's principal  complaint on appeal  is that the\n\ndistrict  court enunciated an  ironclad rule holding  that, where\n\nwitnesses'  trial testimony  and their  other  statements on  the\n\nissue  of   drug  quantity   conflict,  the   former  necessarily\n\ncontrols.3   We  think  this  is an  accurate  assessment of  the\n\ndistrict  court's position.   For  one thing,  the judge  himself\n\nrepeatedly stated as much.  He said, for example:  \"I don't think\n\nthat I  can go beyond  [the evidence at  trial]. .  . .   I don't\n\nthink that  [considering inconsistent  statements  made prior  to\n\n                    \n\n     3Appellant also attacks the adequacy of the district court's\nfindings.  That attack fails.  See infra Part II(B).\n                                        \n\n                                5\n\ntrial] is what  I do. . . .    [I]t is   the  evidence   that  is\n\npresented  at  trial  that controls. . . .  [W]hat should control\n\nis  the  evidence  that  is  presented  at  trial.\"    These  are\n\ncategorical  pronouncements   reflecting  careful   thought,  not\n\nstatements in  any way  qualified or  specially  tailored to  the\n\nfacts  of the  case.4   While some  individual phrases,  taken in\n\nisolation,  may  be   either  ambiguous  or  subject   to  benign\n\nexplanation, the cumulative  import of these statements,  read in\n\ncontext, is unmistakable.\n\n          For  another thing, the judge's actions speak as loudly\n\nas his words    and they speak to  the same end.  Insofar  as the\n\nrecord  reflects,  the judge  never  read  or,  at  least,  never\n\nanalyzed,  the   defense's  submission,  presumably   because  he\n\nregarded  it as  irrelevant.   In  contrast, the  judge read  the\n\ngovernment's submission on the  bench and credited it  because it\n\njibed with his recollection of  the trial testimony.  Of critical\n\nimportance, the judge  did not act as  if he were making  a case-\n\nspecific  ruling:  he neither compared the arithmetical soundness\n\nof   the   competing   drug   quantity   calculations  nor   made\n\nparticularized credibility determinations.\n\n          Third,  the district court's  formal findings are  of a\n\npiece with our  reading of the sentencing transcript.   The court\n\neschewed any  detailed, independent  findings, but,  rather, made\n\n                    \n\n     4This  is not  a situation  involving a  simple slip  of the\ntongue or  an \"awkward locution.\"   Lenn v. Portland  Sch. Comm.,\n                                                                \n998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st  Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).  Rather,\nthis  case  features  a studied  course  of  action, thoughtfully\nundertaken and repeatedly articulated.\n\n                                6\n\nwhat appear  to be implicit findings.   On the  order of judgment\n\nform, the court adopted the recommended findings contained in the\n\nPSI Report.   These  findings included,  of course, the  proposed\n\nfindings presented in the government's April 9 letter   a missive\n\npremised solely  on trial  testimony, summarily  approved by  the\n\nprobation  officer, and  eventually  appended  to  the  order  of\n\njudgment form.\n\n          Fourth, the lack of  comparative analysis and  detailed\n\nfindings gains added  significance when it  is viewed in  concert\n\nwith the  judge's avowed uncertainty  about the propriety  of his\n\nactions.   If the court  were making  a fact-specific  comparison\n\nbased on  demeanor evidence    a humdrum  exercise    rather than\n\npronouncing a neoteric rule of  law, there would have been little\n\npoint in \"trying\" to set the  stage to give Tavano \"a very  clear\n\nshot on appeal.\"\n\n          We are  obliged to  review a trial  court's actions  as\n\nthey are made  manifest in the record, cf.  Advance Fin. Corp. v.\n                                                              \n\nIsla  Rica  Sales,  Inc.,  747   F.2d  21,  26  (1st  Cir.  1984)\n                        \n\n(acknowledging that \"the  district court speaks to  [the court of\n\nappeals]  primarily  through  its  decrees\");  and,  while   word\n\nprocessing is  incapable of  fully reproducing  the thickness  of\n\nreality,   we  are  confident  that,  here,  the  district  court\n\nformulated  a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative\n                    \n\nof drug quantity, to the  exclusion of all other evidence bearing\n\n                                7\n\nupon  the  same  set  of  transactions.5    We  proceed  on  that\n\nunderstanding.\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          Having  satisfied ourselves  as to  the  import of  the\n\nrecord, we summarize  the legal principles that allow  us to test\n\nthe  soundness of the  lower court's rationale  and, accordingly,\n\ngovern the disposition of this appeal.  Next,  we set some allied\n\nconcerns to rest.   At journey's end, we apply  the discerned law\n\nin light of what transpired below.\n\n                 A.  Applicable Legal Principles.\n                                                \n\n          A  number of  other  tribunals  have  had  occasion  to\n\nemphasize  the obligation that  devolves upon a  sentencing court\n\npresented  with conflicting drug quantity evidence to review that\n\nevidence  and exercise independent  judgment.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Goines,  988 F.2d  750,  775 (7th  Cir.)  (admonishing\n                 \n\ncourts  to \"resist  the  urge to  accept  summarily the  quantity\n\nalleged by the government\"), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 241 (1993);\n                                         \n\nUnited States  v. Gilliam,  987 F.2d 1009,  1013 (4th  Cir. 1993)\n                         \n\n(\"When the amount  of drugs for which  a defendant is to  be held\n\nresponsible   is  disputed,  the  district  court  must  make  an\n\nindependent  resolution of  the factual  issue  at sentencing.\");\n\n                    \n\n     5Even  if  there  were room  for  an  objectively reasonable\ndivision of opinion  on what the judge  intended   and we  see no\nsuch room here   it is apparent that the ends of justice are best\nserved  by giving appellant the benefit of any doubt.  Cf., e.g.,\n                                                                \nBifulco v.  United States, 447  U.S. 381, 387  (1980) (discussing\n                         \napplicability of rule of lenity to ambiguous criminal statutes).\n\n                                8\n\nUnited  States v.  Collado,  975  F.2d 985,  998  (3d Cir.  1992)\n                          \n\n(explaining  that a \"sentencing  court must carefully  review the\n\ngovernment's  [drug  quantity]  submissions to  ensure  that  its\n\nestimates are proven  by a preponderance of the evidence\").  In a\n\ncase that  bears haunting  similarities to the  case at  bar, the\n\nSixth  Circuit vacated a defendant's sentence because it appeared\n\npossible  that the district judge placed the jury's drug quantity\n\nfindings  on  a  pedestal  and treated  them  as  controlling  at\n\nsentencing,  without  independent  analysis   of  other  relevant\n\nevidence.  See United States v.  Prior, 941 F.2d 427, 430-31 (6th\n                                      \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 613 (1991).  Such a per se  rule,\n                                                          \n\nChief  Judge Merritt wrote, would  defile the principle that \"the\n\nsentencing   judge   must   exercise  independent   judgment   in\n\nsentencing.\"  Id. at 431.\n                 \n\n          We, too, recognize that  the district court has  a duty\n\nto  consider all relevant  drug quantity evidence  at sentencing,\n\neven if that evidence is from the same sources as, and  conflicts\n\nwith, evidence  adduced at  trial.  In  the final  analysis, this\n\nduty derives from the Due  Process Clause, which guarantees every\n\ndefendant a \"right to be  sentenced upon information which is not\n\nfalse or  materially incorrect.\"   United  States v. Berzon,  941\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  8, 18 (1st Cir. 1991);  accord United States v.

To give content to this  right, a\n\ncourt must take pains to base  sentencing judgments upon reliable\n\nand accurate  information.   See Berzon, 941  F.2d at  18; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Prescott, 920 F.2d  139, 143 (2d  Cir. 1990).   And to\n                   \n\n                                9\n\nassure itself that  a piece of proof is  sufficiently reliable, a\n\ncourt  must  consider  all   the  available  evidence,  including\n\nconflicting evidence.\n\n          The  Criminal Rules  are designed  to  nourish the  due\n\nprocess right  to be  sentenced based  on substantially  accurate\n\ninformation.   See  Curran,  926  F.2d at  61;  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nGerante, 891 F.2d  364, 367  (1st Cir. 1989).   Thus, a  district\n       \n\ncourt confronted with  an alleged error of fact  in a presentence\n\nreport must make either  \"(i) a finding as to  the allegation, or\n\n(ii) a  determination that no  such finding is  necessary because\n\nthe  matter  controverted  will  not  be  taken  into account  in\n\nsentencing.\"    Fed. R.  Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D);  see  also United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc.,  922 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991)  (collecting  cases).   The  federal sentencing  guidelines\n\nslant in the same direction and, to that extent, also nourish the\n\ndue process right:\n\n          When any  factor important to  the sentencing\n          determination is  reasonably in  dispute, the\n          parties   shall   be    given   an   adequate\n          opportunity  to  present information  to  the\n          court  regarding that  factor.   In resolving\n          any  reasonable dispute  concerning a  factor\n          important  to  the  sentencing determination,\n          the court  may consider  relevant information\n          without regard to its admissibility under the\n          rules  of   evidence  applicable   at  trial,\n          provided that the  information has sufficient\n          indicia   of  reliability   to  support   its\n          probable accuracy.\n\nU.S.S.G.  6A1.3 (Nov. 1992).   In our estimation,  this provision\n\nnot only requires  sentencing courts to afford defendants  a fair\n\nopportunity  to   present  information  relevant   to  sentencing\n\n                                10\n\n(including  information at  variance with  trial  testimony), but\n\nalso requires courts to mull any information adduced.\n\n          The  government  asserts  that  section  6A1.3  cuts  a\n\nnarrower swath.   It notes  that, in terms, the  policy statement\n\nmandates only presentation of conflicting evidence;  the language\n                          \n\nmentioning  evaluation  of  such  evidence  (\"may  consider\")  is\n\npermissive   and,  therefore,   the  government   says,  judicial\n\nconsideration of presented material is in the court's discretion.\n             \n\nWe  reject this  now-you-see-it, now-you-don't  prestidigitation,\n\nfor  neither the government's hocus-pocus nor its crabbed reading\n\nof  section 6A1.3  make any  real sense.   Drawing  an artificial\n\ndistinction  between presentation and  consideration    much like\n\ndrawing a distinction between the opportunity to be heard and the\n\nopportunity  to  be  listened  to     reduces  the  guideline  to\n\ngibberish,  stripping it  of its  essential meaning.   We  do not\n\nthink the Sentencing Commission, in drafting section 6A1.3, could\n\npossibly  have  meant   to  give  defendants  such   cold  gruel,\n\npretending to confer a benefit,  yet, simultaneously, withholding\n\nthe  benefit's intrinsic  value.   Indeed, with  this reality  in\n\nmind,  we have already interpreted section  6A1.3 to \"require the\n                                                             \n\nsentencing court to  make an independent  determination regarding\n\nthe  reliability of all  proffered evidence.\"   United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nZuleta-Alvarez,  922  F.2d  33,  36  (1st  Cir.  1990)  (emphasis\n              \n\nsupplied), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 2039 (1991).6\n                       \n\n                    \n\n     6Although we did  not at the  time justify this  requirement\nwith specific reference to the  text of section 6A1.3, we believe\nthat it  may fairly  be inferred,  both as  a gloss  on the  word\n\n                                11\n\n          The duty  to consider  evidence conflicting with  trial\n\ntestimony takes on special urgency in the drug  quantity context.\n\nThough sentencing judges  may look to  trial testimony when  they\n\nadjudicate factual disputes ancillary to  sentencing,7 see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v. Ruiz,  905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.  1990), there\n                     \n\nare at least  two good reasons to be  skeptical of total reliance\n\non trial testimony in this context.  First, under the guidelines,\n\ndrug  quantity is  a factor  of extraordinary  importance to  the\n\nsentencing calculus.  See United States v. Morillo,     F.3d    ,\n                                                  \n\n    (1st  Cir. 1993)  [No. 93-1388, slip  op. at  12] (explaining\n\nthat \"drug quantity profoundly affects sentence length,\" with the\n\nresult that \"relatively small quantitative differences often have\n\na  significant leveraging effect\" in respect to sentence length);\n\nUnited  States v.  Bradley, 917  F.2d  601, 604  (1st Cir.  1990)\n                          \n\n(describing  drug  quantity  as  \"a  key  datum\"  in  determining\n\nsentences of drug traffickers).  It is, therefore, imperative for\n\na  sentencing court  to shine  a  very bright  light on  possible\n\nanswers to  the drug  quantity  inquiry.   Second, drug  quantity\n\ntestimony, even if  subject to reasonable dispute, is  not apt to\n\nbe   challenged  vigorously   at   trial,  for   defendants   are\n\n                    \n\n\"adequate\"  (in the phrase \"adequate opportunity to present\") and\nas the only  policy consistent with the guideline's  spirit.  The\nopportunity  to present information  could hardly be  regarded as\n\"adequate\" if the court retained  the power to file the presented\ninformation away, sight unseen, and continue blithely on its way.\n\n     7We  refer here  to the  mine-run  of cases;  there are,  of\ncourse,  special situations in which reliance on particular trial\ntestimony may be  inappropriate.  See, e.g., Berzon,  941 F.2d at\n                                                   \n20.\n\n                                12\n\nunderstandably  wary of conceding culpability before the jury and\n\noften prefer  to pitch their case  on bedrock issues of  guilt or\n\ninnocence.   See United States  v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228,\n                                                  \n\n232 (1st Cir.  1993); Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 36.  Thus, drug\n                                    \n\nquantity, by its nature,  is likely to be a \"factor  important to\n\nthe sentencing determination,\"  and, even after trial,  is likely\n\nto remain \"reasonably  in dispute.\"  U.S.S.G.  6A1.3.   These are\n\nprecisely  the  circumstances  under which  a  timely  request to\n\nconsider conflicting evidence must be honored.\n\n          To sum up, we hold, consistent with the dictates of due\n\nprocess,  that both  Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D)  and U.S.S.G.\n\n 6A1.3  require  a  sentencing  court  independently to  consider\n\nproffered  information that is relevant to matters of consequence\n\nin the  sentencing determination.   In cases where  drug quantity\n\nqualifies  under  this rubric,  a reviewing  court is  obliged to\n\nconsider all available evidence having probative value, including\n\nbut not limited  to witnesses' prior inconsistent  statements and\n\nother proof contradicting witnesses' trial testimony, and to pass\n\nindependent judgment thereon.\n\n                   B.  Allied Legal Principles.\n                                              \n\n          In    the    interest    of    avoiding   any    future\n\nmisunderstandings,  we  wish  to  clarify  three  allied  points.\n\nFirst,  a trial  judge's duty  to  consider conflicting  evidence\n\nseasonably  presented during  the  sentencing  phase  in  no  way\n\nimplies a duty of blind acceptance.  When all is said and done, a\n\njudge,  after examining all the relevant evidence, may ordinarily\n\n                                13\n\npick  and choose.   And  in the  process,  the judge  may decide,\n\nbecause of  its persuasive  force in a  particular case,  to fall\n\nback upon, and ultimately to credit, trial testimony.\n\n          Next,  we  summarily  dismiss  appellant's  claim  that\n\neither  the duty of  independent consideration or, alternatively,\n\nRule 32, implies a duty of  free-standing articulation.  Explicit\n\nfindings,   while  often  desirable,  are  not  indispensable  in\n\nconnection  with drug  quantity issues.8   As  a general  rule, a\n\ntrial court lawfully  may make implicit  findings with regard  to\n\nsentencing matters, incorporating  by reference suitably detailed\n\nsuggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced by a party.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir. 1993); Wells\n                                                                 \n\nMetal, 922  F.2d at  58.   That practice  is permissible  in drug\n     \n\ncases as  in other cases.9  See,  e.g., United States v. Barnett,\n                                                                \n\n989 F.2d 546, 551-52  &amp; n.5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  114 S. Ct.\n                                                    \n\n148 (1993); United States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 618-19 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992); Gerante, 891 F.2d at 367.\n              \n\n          Finally, we  do not mean  to suggest that a  court must\n\nalways resolve every controversy that  touches upon the amount of\n\ndrugs involved in an  offense, scheme, or course of  conduct.  It\n\nis unnecessary to address a dispute over drug quantity if, and to\n\nthe  extent that, adjudicating  it will not  alter the applicable\n\n                    \n\n     8We see nothing  in our opinion in United  States v. Hanono-\n                                                                 \nSurujun,  914  F.2d 15,  19  (1st  Cir.  1990), much  bruited  by\n       \nappellant, that compels a different conclusion.\n\n     9On  this basis,  we reject  appellant's  argument that  the\ncourt below transgressed Rule 32  by the use of implicit findings\nin respect to drug quantity.\n\n                                14\n\noffense level, influence the guideline sentencing range, or bring\n\na  different mandatory minimum sentence into  play.10  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nBradley, 917 F.2d at 604.\n       \n\n                       C.  The Bottom Line.\n                                          \n\n          The principles we have discussed are dispositive of the\n\ninstant  appeal.     Although  a   sentencing  court's  factbound\n\ndetermination of  drug quantity  is usually  reviewable only  for\n\nclear error, see id. at  605, judgments concerning the applicable\n                    \n\nrules of  law are subject  to plenary review.   See Morillo,     \n                                                           \n\nF.3d at      [slip op. at 14]; see also United States v. St. Cyr,\n                                                                \n\n977  F.2d 698,  701  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (holding  that, under  the\n\nguidelines, claimed  mistakes of law  are reviewed de novo).   In\n                                                          \n\nthis case,  we conclude  that the lower  court lapsed  into error\n\nwhen it  formulated a  per se rule  and refused  independently to\n                             \n\nconsider evidence at  variance with  trial testimony.   Since  we\n\ncannot say  with fair assurance  that the mistake did  not affect\n\nthe outcome, resentencing is required.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  For the reasons stated, we hold\n\nthat  the  district  court  erred  in  failing  independently  to\n\n                    \n\n     10To  illustrate,  if  the  present  controversy  over  drug\nquantity boiled down to the difference between, say, six and nine\nkilograms of cocaine,  the court would not be  obliged to resolve\nit.    Either  way, the  offense  level  would be  the  same, see\n                                                                 \nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(6)  (Drug  Quantity  Table) (setting  offense\nlevel  for  offenses involving  5  or  more,  but less  than  15,\nkilograms  of cocaine), the  sentencing range would  be the same,\ncf. id.,  and the mandatory  minimum sentence would be  the same,\n       \nsee  21  U.S.C.     841(b)(1)(A)(ii)  (fixing obligatory  minimum\n   \nsentence for offenses involving 5 or more kilograms of cocaine).\n\n                                15\n\nscrutinize   proffered  evidence   conflicting  with   the  trial\n\ntestimony  anent drug quantity.11   Hence, we  vacate appellant's\n\nsentence and remand for a  new sentencing hearing and for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n                \n\n                    \n\n     11We  venture   no  opinion   as  to   whether,  after   due\nconsideration, the  disputed trial  testimony  should (or  should\nnot) be  credited in  this instance.   We similarly  refrain from\ncommenting  upon  what  drug   quantity  is  most   appropriately\nattributable to appellant.  Those  matters are for the nisi prius\n                                                                 \ncourt.\n\n                                16\n",

Sec. 846 (1988).  Dissatisfied with the outcome, appellant engaged new counsel.  The probation officer proceeded to compile the presentence investigation report (PSI Report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1993, the PSI Report emerged.  It adopted the prosecution's version of the crime, concluding that appellant's relevant conduct encompassed between five and fifteen kilograms of cocaine.  Appellant's new lawyer objected to this conclusion and, on March 15, 1993, sent a letter to the probation officer spelling out discrepant representations in the grand jury testimony concerning the size and frequency of certain transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The attorney argued that the proffered evidence cast the trial testimony into disrepute and, moreover, giving the proffered evidence its due, appellant could not be held responsible for more than three and one-half kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The prosecutor promptly fired off a detailed rebuttal letter under date of April 9, 1993.  The probation officer, in turn, attached a brief addendum to the PSI Report, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>After review of the materials submitted by both the defense and the government, the probation office feels that the calculations originally submitted in the [PSI] Report are correct and accurately reflect the amount of cocaine for which the defendant can be held accountable.

On the order of judgment form, the court indicated its adoption of the findings suggested in the PSI Report.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>B. Interpreting the Sequence of Events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before appellate review can proceed, it is necessary to clarify exactly what the district judge did and exactly what he did not do.  We are guided in this endeavor by the record--a record that flavors the judge's words and, concomitantly, offers insights into his thinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's principal complaint on appeal is that the district court enunciated an ironclad rule holding that, where witnesses' trial testimony and their other statements on the issue of drug quantity conflict, the former necessarily controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We think this is an accurate assessment of the district court's position.  For one thing, the judge himself repeatedly stated as much.  He said, for example:  \"I don't think that I can go beyond [the evidence at trial]....  I don't think that [considering inconsistent statements made prior to trial] is what I do....  [I]t is the evidence that is presented at trial that controls....  [W]hat should control is the evidence that is presented at trial.\"   These are categorical pronouncements reflecting careful thought, not statements in any way qualified or specially tailored to the facts of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While some individual phrases, taken in isolation, may be either ambiguous or subject to benign explanation, the cumulative import of these statements, read in context, is unmistakable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, the judge's actions speak as loudly as his words--and they speak to the same end.  Insofar as the record reflects, the judge never read or, at least, never analyzed, the defense's submission, presumably because he regarded it as irrelevant.  In contrast, the judge read the government's submission on the bench and credited it because it jibed with his recollection of the trial testimony.  Of critical importance, the judge did not act as if he were making a case-specific ruling:  he neither compared the arithmetical soundness of the competing drug quantity calculations nor made particularized credibility determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district court's formal findings are of a piece with our reading of the sentencing transcript.  The court eschewed any detailed, independent findings, but, rather, made what appear to be implicit findings.  On the order of judgment form, the court adopted the recommended findings contained in the PSI Report.  These findings included, of course, the proposed findings presented in the government's April 9 letter--a missive premised solely on trial testimony, summarily approved by the probation officer, and eventually appended to the order of judgment form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the lack of comparative analysis and detailed findings gains added significance when it is viewed in concert with the judge's avowed uncertainty about the propriety of his actions.  If the court were making a fact-specific comparison based on demeanor evidence--a humdrum exercise--rather than pronouncing a neoteric rule of law, there would have been little point in \"trying\" to set the stage to give Tavano \"a very clear shot on appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are obliged to review a trial court's actions as they are made manifest in the record, cf. Advance Fin.  Corp. v. Isla Rica Sales, Inc., 747 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1984) (acknowledging that \"the district court speaks to [the court of appeals] primarily through its decrees\");  and, while word processing is incapable of fully reproducing the thickness of reality, we are confident that, here, the district court formulated a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative of drug quantity, to the exclusion of all other evidence bearing upon the same set of transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We proceed on that understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having satisfied ourselves as to the import of the record, we summarize the legal principles that allow us to test the soundness of the lower court's rationale and, accordingly, govern the disposition of this appeal.  Next, we set some allied concerns to rest.  At journey's end, we apply the discerned law in light of what transpired below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>A. Applicable Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of other tribunals have had occasion to emphasize the obligation that devolves upon a sentencing court presented with conflicting drug quantity evidence to review that evidence and exercise independent judgment.  See, e.g., United States v. Goines, 988 F.2d 750, 775 (7th Cir.)  (admonishing courts to \"resist the urge to accept summarily the quantity alleged by the government\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 241, 126 L.Ed.2d 195 (1993);  United States v. Gilliam, 987 F.2d 1009, 1013 (4th Cir.1993) (\"When the amount of drugs for which a defendant is to be held responsible is disputed, the district court must make an independent resolution of the factual issue at sentencing.\");  United States v. Collado, 975 F.2d 985, 998 (3d Cir.1992) (explaining that a \"sentencing court must carefully review the government's [drug quantity] submissions to ensure that its estimates are proven by a preponderance of the evidence\").  In a case that bears haunting similarities to the case at bar, the Sixth Circuit vacated a defendant's sentence because it appeared possible that the district judge placed the jury's drug quantity findings on a pedestal and treated them as controlling at sentencing, without independent analysis of other relevant evidence.  See United States v. Prior, 941 F.2d 427, 430-31 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 613, 116 L.Ed.2d 635 (1991).  Such a per se rule, Chief Judge Merritt wrote, would defile the principle that \"the sentencing judge must exercise independent judgment in sentencing.\"  Id. at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, too, recognize that the district court has a duty to consider all relevant drug quantity evidence at sentencing, even if that evidence is from the same sources as, and conflicts with, evidence adduced at trial.  In the final analysis, this duty derives from the Due Process Clause, which guarantees every defendant a \"right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.\"  United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  accord United States v. Curran, 926 F.2d 59, 61 (1st Cir.1991).  To give content to this right, a court must take pains to base sentencing judgments upon reliable and accurate information.  See Berzon, 941 F.2d at 18;  United States v. Prescott, 920 F.2d 139, 143 (2d Cir.1990).  And to assure itself that a piece of proof is sufficiently reliable, a court must consider all the available evidence, including conflicting evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Criminal Rules are designed to nourish the due process right to be sentenced based on substantially accurate information.  See Curran, 926 F.2d at 61;  United States v. Gerante, 891 F.2d 364, 367 (1st Cir.1989).  Thus, a district court confronted with an alleged error of fact in a presentence report must make either \"(i) a finding as to the allegation, or (ii) a determination that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D);  see also United States v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc., 922 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases).  The federal sentencing guidelines slant in the same direction and, to that extent, also nourish the due process right:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>When any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.  In resolving any reasonable dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3 (Nov. 1992).  In our estimation, this provision not only requires sentencing courts to afford defendants a fair opportunity to present information relevant to sentencing (including information at variance with trial testimony), but also requires courts to mull any information adduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that section 6A1.3 cuts a narrower swath.  It notes that, in terms, the policy statement mandates only presentation of conflicting evidence;  the language mentioning evaluation of such evidence (\"may consider\") is permissive and, therefore, the government says, judicial consideration of presented material is in the court's discretion.  We reject this now-you-see-it, now-you-don't prestidigitation, for neither the government's hocus-pocus nor its crabbed reading of section 6A1.3 make any real sense.  Drawing an artificial distinction between presentation and consideration--much like drawing a distinction between the opportunity to be heard and the opportunity to be listened to--reduces the guideline to gibberish, stripping it of its essential meaning.  We do not think the Sentencing Commission, in drafting section 6A1.3, could possibly have meant to give defendants such cold gruel, pretending to confer a benefit, yet, simultaneously, withholding the benefit's intrinsic value.  Indeed, with this reality in mind, we have already interpreted section 6A1.3 to \"require the sentencing court to make an independent determination regarding the reliability of all proffered evidence.\"  United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis supplied), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2039, 114 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The duty to consider evidence conflicting with trial testimony takes on special urgency in the drug quantity context.  Though sentencing judges may look to trial testimony when they adjudicate factual disputes ancillary to sentencing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> see, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990), there are at least two good reasons to be skeptical of total reliance on trial testimony in this context.  First, under the guidelines, drug quantity is a factor of extraordinary importance to the sentencing calculus.  See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 870 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that \"drug quantity profoundly affects sentence length,\" with the result that \"relatively small quantitative differences often have a significant leveraging effect\" in respect to sentence length);  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990) (describing drug quantity as \"a key datum\" in determining sentences of drug traffickers).  It is, therefore, imperative for a sentencing court to shine a very bright light on possible answers to the drug quantity inquiry.  Second, drug quantity testimony, even if subject to reasonable dispute, is not apt to be challenged vigorously at trial, for defendants are understandably wary of conceding culpability before the jury and often prefer to pitch their case on bedrock issues of guilt or innocence.  See United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 232 (1st Cir.1993);  Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 36.   Thus, drug quantity, by its nature, is likely to be a \"factor important to the sentencing determination,\" and, even after trial, is likely to remain \"reasonably in dispute.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  These are precisely the circumstances under which a timely request to consider conflicting evidence must be honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold, consistent with the dictates of due process, that both Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) and U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3 require a sentencing court independently to consider proffered information that is relevant to matters of consequence in the sentencing determination.  In cases where drug quantity qualifies under this rubric, a reviewing court is obliged to consider all available evidence having probative value, including but not limited to witnesses' prior inconsistent statements and other proof contradicting witnesses' trial testimony, and to pass independent judgment thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>B. Allied Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interest of avoiding any future misunderstandings, we wish to clarify three allied points.  First, a trial judge's duty to consider conflicting evidence seasonably presented during the sentencing phase in no way implies a duty of blind acceptance.  When all is said and done, a judge, after examining all the relevant evidence, may ordinarily pick and choose.  And in the process, the judge may decide, because of its persuasive force in a particular case, to fall back upon, and ultimately to credit, trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we summarily dismiss appellant's claim that either the duty of independent consideration or, alternatively, Rule 32, implies a duty of free-standing articulation.  Explicit findings, while often desirable, are not indispensable in connection with drug quantity issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make implicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating by reference suitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced by a party.  See United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir.1993);  Wells Metal, 922 F.2d at 58.   That practice is permissible in drug cases as in other cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   See, e.g., United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 551-52 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 149, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993);   United States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 618-19 (1st Cir.1992);   Gerante, 891 F.2d at 367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we do not mean to suggest that a court must always resolve every controversy that touches upon the amount of drugs involved in an offense, scheme, or course of conduct.  It is unnecessary to address a dispute over drug quantity if, and to the extent that, adjudicating it will not alter the applicable offense level, influence the guideline sentencing range, or bring a different mandatory minimum sentence into play.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See, e.g., Bradley, 917 F.2d at 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>C. The Bottom Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles we have discussed are dispositive of the instant appeal.  Although a sentencing court's factbound determination of drug quantity is usually reviewable only for clear error, see id. at 605, judgments concerning the applicable rules of law are subject to plenary review.  See Morillo, 8 F.3d at 871;  see also United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, under the guidelines, claimed mistakes of law are reviewed de novo ).  In this case, we conclude that the lower court lapsed into error when it formulated a per se rule and refused independently to consider evidence at variance with trial testimony.  Since we cannot say with fair assurance that the mistake did not affect the outcome, resentencing is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For the reasons stated, we hold that the district court erred in failing independently to scrutinize proffered evidence conflicting with the trial testimony anent drug quantity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Hence, we vacate appellant's sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By and large, this testimony originated from the same sources, and referred to the same transactions, as the trial testimony on which the probation officer and the prosecution relied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The prize at stake in the battle over drug quantity is no mere bagatelle.  If five or more kilograms of cocaine are properly attributable to Tavano, he is subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of ten years, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), as opposed to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years if his alternative calculation is credited, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Tavano's base offense level and guideline sentencing range are similarly affected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellant also attacks the adequacy of the district court's findings.  That attack fails.  See infra Part II(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This is not a situation involving a simple slip of the tongue or an \"awkward locution.\"   Lenn v.  Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases).  Rather, this case features a studied course of action, thoughtfully undertaken and repeatedly articulated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Even if there were room for an objectively reasonable division of opinion on what the judge intended--and we see no such room here--it is apparent that the ends of justice are best served by giving appellant the benefit of any doubt.  Cf., e.g., Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980) (discussing applicability of rule of lenity to ambiguous criminal statutes)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although we did not at the time justify this requirement with specific reference to the text of section 6A1.3, we believe that it may fairly be inferred, both as a gloss on the word \"adequate\" (in the phrase \"adequate opportunity to present\") and as the only policy consistent with the guideline's spirit.  The opportunity to present information could hardly be regarded as \"adequate\" if the court retained the power to file the presented information away, sight unseen, and continue blithely on its way</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We refer here to the mine-run of cases;  there are, of course, special situations in which reliance on particular trial testimony may be inappropriate.  See, e.g., Berzon, 941 F.2d at 20</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We see nothing in our opinion in United States v. Hanono-Surujun, 914 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1990), much bruited by appellant, that compels a different conclusion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> On this basis, we reject appellant's argument that the court below transgressed Rule 32 by the use of implicit findings in respect to drug quantity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> To illustrate, if the present controversy over drug quantity boiled down to the difference between, say, six and nine kilograms of cocaine, the court would not be obliged to resolve it.  Either way, the offense level would be the same, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Table) (setting offense level for offenses involving 5 or more, but less than 15, kilograms of cocaine), the sentencing range would be the same, cf. id., and the mandatory minimum sentence would be the same, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (fixing obligatory minimum sentence for offenses involving 5 or more kilograms of cocaine)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We venture no opinion as to whether, after due consideration, the disputed trial testimony should (or should not) be credited in this instance.

Because we understand the court below to have fashioned a per se rule giving controlling effect to trial testimony, come what may, and because the court, in fidelity to its self-hewn rule, did not meaningfully consider conflicting evidence proffered by the defense, we vacate appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bifurcate our account of what transpired below, first elucidating the sequence of relevant events, and then placing an interpretive gloss on those events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>A. The Sequence of Events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury found defendant-appellant James Tavano guilty of conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846 (1988).  Dissatisfied with the outcome, appellant engaged new counsel.  The probation officer proceeded to compile the presentence investigation report (PSI Report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1993, the PSI Report emerged.  It adopted the prosecution's version of the crime, concluding that appellant's relevant conduct encompassed between five and fifteen kilograms of cocaine.  Appellant's new lawyer objected to this conclusion and, on March 15, 1993, sent a letter to the probation officer spelling out discrepant representations in the grand jury testimony concerning the size and frequency of certain transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The attorney argued that the proffered evidence cast the trial testimony into disrepute and, moreover, giving the proffered evidence its due, appellant could not be held responsible for more than three and one-half kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The prosecutor promptly fired off a detailed rebuttal letter under date of April 9, 1993.  The probation officer, in turn, attached a brief addendum to the PSI Report, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>After review of the materials submitted by both the defense and the government, the probation office feels that the calculations originally submitted in the [PSI] Report are correct and accurately reflect the amount of cocaine for which the defendant can be held accountable.  The report is unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened a disposition hearing one week later.  Here follows, at length, the crucial exchange between defense counsel and the judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL:  I'd like to say that I think perhaps the thing to do in this case is not to sentence, but perhaps take some time and have one of your clerks maybe go through [my March 15] submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGE:  No.  No.  I don't want to do that.  It is not the kind of thing I would do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have just read, I think carefully, the government's statement, which is helpful in refreshing my recollection as to what happened at the trial.  You weren't here at the trial, although you did read the transcript, and I think what [the prosecutor] says is accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL:  Your Honor, it may be accurate but--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGE:  I don't think that I can go beyond that.  In other words, I think what your point is, is that if I consider the grand jury testimony, if I consider prior inconsistent statements, I can come out a different way, but I don't think that is what I do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems people come to court and they testify.  This is the dough issue, so to speak, as you well know, and it is the evidence that is presented at trial that controls;  and, even in the most conservative efforts to try to make sure there is no double charging against your client, he comes out well above the amount that is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL:  I don't think that is true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGE:  I am not saying I am right.  I hope I am right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL:  ... I say that you have a right to look at both of these testimonies and make the decision as to what the weight was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGE:  ... You didn't try the case, and I didn't try the case.  I presided, and you were somewhere else.  But I do think that what should control is the evidence that is presented at trial.  That is where everything gets shaken down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that [the prosecutor's] statement of what took place at trial is reasonably presented in this April 9, 1993 submission ...;  and for purposes of the record, I will adopt his statement as my findings.  If I have made a mistake, then that gives you a very clear shot on appeal.  That is what I am trying to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this exchange, the court selected a guideline sentencing range on the basis of its finding that appellant handled between five and fifteen kilograms of cocaine, and sentenced appellant to a prison term of 121 months (the nadir of the chosen range), capped by five years of supervised release.  On the order of judgment form, the court indicated its adoption of the findings suggested in the PSI Report.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>B. Interpreting the Sequence of Events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before appellate review can proceed, it is necessary to clarify exactly what the district judge did and exactly what he did not do.  We are guided in this endeavor by the record--a record that flavors the judge's words and, concomitantly, offers insights into his thinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's principal complaint on appeal is that the district court enunciated an ironclad rule holding that, where witnesses' trial testimony and their other statements on the issue of drug quantity conflict, the former necessarily controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We think this is an accurate assessment of the district court's position.  For one thing, the judge himself repeatedly stated as much.  He said, for example:  \"I don't think that I can go beyond [the evidence at trial]....  I don't think that [considering inconsistent statements made prior to trial] is what I do....  [I]t is the evidence that is presented at trial that controls....  [W]hat should control is the evidence that is presented at trial.\"   These are categorical pronouncements reflecting careful thought, not statements in any way qualified or specially tailored to the facts of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While some individual phrases, taken in isolation, may be either ambiguous or subject to benign explanation, the cumulative import of these statements, read in context, is unmistakable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, the judge's actions speak as loudly as his words--and they speak to the same end.  Insofar as the record reflects, the judge never read or, at least, never analyzed, the defense's submission, presumably because he regarded it as irrelevant.  In contrast, the judge read the government's submission on the bench and credited it because it jibed with his recollection of the trial testimony.  Of critical importance, the judge did not act as if he were making a case-specific ruling:  he neither compared the arithmetical soundness of the competing drug quantity calculations nor made particularized credibility determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district court's formal findings are of a piece with our reading of the sentencing transcript.  The court eschewed any detailed, independent findings, but, rather, made what appear to be implicit findings.  On the order of judgment form, the court adopted the recommended findings contained in the PSI Report.  These findings included, of course, the proposed findings presented in the government's April 9 letter--a missive premised solely on trial testimony, summarily approved by the probation officer, and eventually appended to the order of judgment form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the lack of comparative analysis and detailed findings gains added significance when it is viewed in concert with the judge's avowed uncertainty about the propriety of his actions.  If the court were making a fact-specific comparison based on demeanor evidence--a humdrum exercise--rather than pronouncing a neoteric rule of law, there would have been little point in \"trying\" to set the stage to give Tavano \"a very clear shot on appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are obliged to review a trial court's actions as they are made manifest in the record, cf. Advance Fin.  Corp. v. Isla Rica Sales, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443943\"><a href=\"/opinion/443943/advance-financial-corporation-v-isla-rica-sales-inc-antonio-novoa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1984) (acknowledging that \"the district court speaks to [the court of appeals] primarily through its decrees\");  and, while word processing is incapable of fully reproducing the thickness of reality, we are confident that, here, the district court formulated a per se rule declaring trial testimony determinative of drug quantity, to the exclusion of all other evidence bearing upon the same set of transactions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We proceed on that understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having satisfied ourselves as to the import of the record, we summarize the legal principles that allow us to test the soundness of the lower court's rationale and, accordingly, govern the disposition of this appeal.  Next, we set some allied concerns to rest.  At journey's end, we apply the discerned law in light of what transpired below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>A. Applicable Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of other tribunals have had occasion to emphasize the obligation that devolves upon a sentencing court presented with conflicting drug quantity evidence to review that evidence and exercise independent judgment.  See, e.g., United States v. Goines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602407\"><a href=\"/opinion/602407/united-states-v-bernard-goines-ellen-j-moreland-sterling-daniels/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 775 (7th Cir.)  (admonishing courts to \"resist the urge to accept summarily the quantity alleged by the government\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Collado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591135\"><a href=\"/opinion/591135/united-states-v-policai-collado-aka-poli-jorge-collado-in-91-1492/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 998 (3d Cir.1992) (explaining that a \"sentencing court must carefully review the government's [drug quantity] submissions to ensure that its estimates are proven by a preponderance of the evidence\").  In a case that bears haunting similarities to the case at bar, the Sixth Circuit vacated a defendant's sentence because it appeared possible that the district judge placed the jury's drug quantity findings on a pedestal and treated them as controlling at sentencing, without independent analysis of other relevant evidence.  See United States v. Prior, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566355\"><a href=\"/opinion/566355/united-states-v-eric-prior/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430-31 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span> (1991).  Such a per se rule, Chief Judge Merritt wrote, would defile the principle that \"the sentencing judge must exercise independent judgment in sentencing.\"  Id. at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, too, recognize that the district court has a duty to consider all relevant drug quantity evidence at sentencing, even if that evidence is from the same sources as, and conflicts with, evidence adduced at trial.  In the final analysis, this duty derives from the Due Process Clause, which guarantees every defendant a \"right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.\"  United States v. Berzon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566304\"><a href=\"/opinion/566304/united-states-v-robert-alan-berzon/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  accord United States v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556392\"><a href=\"/opinion/556392/united-states-v-walter-f-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.1991).  To give content to this right, a court must take pains to base sentencing judgments upon reliable and accurate information.  See Berzon, 941 F.2d at 18;  United States v. Prescott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552340\"><a href=\"/opinion/552340/united-states-v-philip-prescott/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 143 (2d Cir.1990).  And to assure itself that a piece of proof is sufficiently reliable, a court must consider all the available evidence, including conflicting evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Criminal Rules are designed to nourish the due process right to be sentenced based on substantially accurate information.  See Curran, 926 F.2d at 61;  United States v. Gerante, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533564\"><a href=\"/opinion/533564/united-states-v-joseph-gerante/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 367 (1st Cir.1989).  Thus, a district court confronted with an alleged error of fact in a presentence report must make either \"(i) a finding as to the allegation, or (ii) a determination that no such finding is necessary because the matter controverted will not be taken into account in sentencing.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D);  see also United States v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553335\"><a href=\"/opinion/553335/united-states-v-wells-metal-finishing-inc-appeal-of-john-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases).  The federal sentencing guidelines slant in the same direction and, to that extent, also nourish the due process right:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>When any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.  In resolving any reasonable dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3 (Nov. 1992).  In our estimation, this provision not only requires sentencing courts to afford defendants a fair opportunity to present information relevant to sentencing (including information at variance with trial testimony), but also requires courts to mull any information adduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that section 6A1.3 cuts a narrower swath.  It notes that, in terms, the policy statement mandates only presentation of conflicting evidence;  the language mentioning evaluation of such evidence (\"may consider\") is permissive and, therefore, the government says, judicial consideration of presented material is in the court's discretion.  We reject this now-you-see-it, now-you-don't prestidigitation, for neither the government's hocus-pocus nor its crabbed reading of section 6A1.3 make any real sense.  Drawing an artificial distinction between presentation and consideration--much like drawing a distinction between the opportunity to be heard and the opportunity to be listened to--reduces the guideline to gibberish, stripping it of its essential meaning.  We do not think the Sentencing Commission, in drafting section 6A1.3, could possibly have meant to give defendants such cold gruel, pretending to confer a benefit, yet, simultaneously, withholding the benefit's intrinsic value.  Indeed, with this reality in mind, we have already interpreted section 6A1.3 to \"require the sentencing court to make an independent determination regarding the reliability of all proffered evidence.\"  United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553331\"><a href=\"/opinion/553331/united-states-v-john-jairo-zuleta-alvarez-aka-john-zuleta-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis supplied), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2039</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></span> (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The duty to consider evidence conflicting with trial testimony takes on special urgency in the drug quantity context.  Though sentencing judges may look to trial testimony when they adjudicate factual disputes ancillary to sentencing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> see, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990), there are at least two good reasons to be skeptical of total reliance on trial testimony in this context.  First, under the guidelines, drug quantity is a factor of extraordinary importance to the sentencing calculus.  See United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 870 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that \"drug quantity profoundly affects sentence length,\" with the result that \"relatively small quantitative differences often have a significant leveraging effect\" in respect to sentence length);  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 604 (1st Cir.1990) (describing drug quantity as \"a key datum\" in determining sentences of drug traffickers).  It is, therefore, imperative for a sentencing court to shine a very bright light on possible answers to the drug quantity inquiry.  Second, drug quantity testimony, even if subject to reasonable dispute, is not apt to be challenged vigorously at trial, for defendants are understandably wary of conceding culpability before the jury and often prefer to pitch their case on bedrock issues of guilt or innocence.  See United States v. Valencia-Lucena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602341\"><a href=\"/opinion/602341/united-states-v-carlos-valencia-lucena-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 232 (1st Cir.1993);  Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 36.   Thus, drug quantity, by its nature, is likely to be a \"factor important to the sentencing determination,\" and, even after trial, is likely to remain \"reasonably in dispute.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  These are precisely the circumstances under which a timely request to consider conflicting evidence must be honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold, consistent with the dictates of due process, that both Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) and U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3 require a sentencing court independently to consider proffered information that is relevant to matters of consequence in the sentencing determination.  In cases where drug quantity qualifies under this rubric, a reviewing court is obliged to consider all available evidence having probative value, including but not limited to witnesses' prior inconsistent statements and other proof contradicting witnesses' trial testimony, and to pass independent judgment thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>B. Allied Legal Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interest of avoiding any future misunderstandings, we wish to clarify three allied points.  First, a trial judge's duty to consider conflicting evidence seasonably presented during the sentencing phase in no way implies a duty of blind acceptance.  When all is said and done, a judge, after examining all the relevant evidence, may ordinarily pick and choose.  And in the process, the judge may decide, because of its persuasive force in a particular case, to fall back upon, and ultimately to credit, trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we summarily dismiss appellant's claim that either the duty of independent consideration or, alternatively, Rule 32, implies a duty of free-standing articulation.  Explicit findings, while often desirable, are not indispensable in connection with drug quantity issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make implicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating by reference suitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report or advanced by a party.  See United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 620 (1st Cir.1993);  Wells Metal, 922 F.2d at 58.   That practice is permissible in drug cases as in other cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   See, e.g., United States v. Barnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603504\"><a href=\"/opinion/603504/united-states-v-michael-barnett-united-states-of-america-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 551-52 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span> (1993);   United States v. Cruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596488\"><a href=\"/opinion/596488/united-states-v-joseph-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, 618-19 (1st Cir.1992);   Gerante, 891 F.2d at 367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we do not mean to suggest that a court must always resolve every controversy that touches upon the amount of drugs involved in an offense, scheme, or course of conduct.  It is unnecessary to address a dispute over drug quantity if, and to the extent that, adjudicating it will not alter the applicable offense level, influence the guideline sentencing range, or bring a different mandatory minimum sentence into play.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See, e.g., Bradley, 917 F.2d at 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>C. The Bottom Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles we have discussed are dispositive of the instant appeal.  Although a sentencing court's factbound determination of drug quantity is usually reviewable only for clear error, see id. at 605, judgments concerning the applicable rules of law are subject to plenary review.  See Morillo, 8 F.3d at 871;  see also United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, under the guidelines, claimed mistakes of law are reviewed de novo ).  In this case, we conclude that the lower court lapsed into error when it formulated a per se rule and refused independently to consider evidence at variance with trial testimony.  Since we cannot say with fair assurance that the mistake did not affect the outcome, resentencing is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For the reasons stated, we hold that the district court erred in failing independently to scrutinize proffered evidence conflicting with the trial testimony anent drug quantity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Hence, we vacate appellant's sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By and large, this testimony originated from the same sources, and referred to the same transactions, as the trial testimony on which the probation officer and the prosecution relied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The prize at stake in the battle over drug quantity is no mere bagatelle.  If five or more kilograms of cocaine are properly attributable to Tavano, he is subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of ten years, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), as opposed to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years if his alternative calculation is credited, see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B)(ii).  Tavano's base offense level and guideline sentencing range are similarly affected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellant also attacks the adequacy of the district court's findings.  That attack fails.  See infra Part II(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This is not a situation involving a simple slip of the tongue or an \"awkward locution.\"   Lenn v.  Portland Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1088 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases).  Rather, this case features a studied course of action, thoughtfully undertaken and repeatedly articulated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Even if there were room for an objectively reasonable division of opinion on what the judge intended--and we see no such room here--it is apparent that the ends of justice are best served by giving appellant the benefit of any doubt.  Cf., e.g., Bifulco v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 387, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110305\"><a href=\"/opinion/110305/bifulco-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The opportunity to present information could hardly be regarded as \"adequate\" if the court retained the power to file the presented information away, sight unseen, and continue blithely on its way</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We refer here to the mine-run of cases;  there are, of course, special situations in which reliance on particular trial testimony may be inappropriate.  See, e.g., Berzon, 941 F.2d at 20</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We see nothing in our opinion in United States v.

Either way, the offense level would be the same, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Table) (setting offense level for offenses involving 5 or more, but less than 15, kilograms of cocaine), the sentencing range would be the same, cf. id., and the mandatory minimum sentence would be the same, see 21 U.S.C.
