This is  an appeal\n          BOWNES,  Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                       \n\nfrom  a decision  of  the tax  court  holding the  petitioner\n\ncivilly liable  for deficiencies in income tax  for the years\n\n1981 and  1982.  The  tax court also found  petitioner liable\n\nfor additions to  the tax due.  The  amounts are substantial,\n\nbut the  computations  are  not contested.    The  tax  court\n\nbrushed aside  petitioner's main defense, that  imposition of\n\nthe   deficiencies  and   additions  to   tax  violates   the\n\nproscription against excessive fines of  the Eighth Amendment\n\nand violates the Double Jeopardy protection  against multiple\n\npunishments  under the Fifth  Amendment.  That  contention is\n\nthe main issue before us.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Petitioner  is a convicted drug dealer.  In October\n\n1987  petitioner was indicted along with Frederick A. Carroll\n\non  a  number  of  criminal  charges:   distribution  of  and\n\nconspiracy  to   distribute  marijuana;  violations   of  the\n\nRacketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),\n\n18 U.S.C.    1962 and  1963; conspiracy to defraud the United\n\nStates; and subscribing to false tax returns.\n\n          In February  of 1988  the Internal  Revenue Service\n\nsent  a   notice  of   deficiency  to   petitioner  assessing\n\ndeficiencies in  income and additions  to tax  for the  years\n\n1981 and 1982.  The interest on the tax and additions thereto\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncontinue to accrue.  As of January 26, 1990, petitioner's tax\n\nliability totalled $2,422,963.94.\n\n          On  June 20, 1988,  petitioner entered into  a plea\n\nagreement with the  United States Attorney whereby  he agreed\n\nto plead guilty to all the  counts in the indictment in which\n\nhe was named.  He also agreed to forfeit all right, title and\n\ninterest  in  the  properties described  in  the  indictment.\n\nPetitioner claims that the value of the forfeited property is\n\n\"approximately $1,200,000.\"   (Brief  at 3.)   The  pertinent\n\nprovisions of the plea agreement provide:\n\n             7.  Mr. McNichols agrees to relinquish\n          all  right,  title  or  interest  in  any\n          monies held in any  foreign bank accounts\n          (or those  located in St.  Thomas, United\n          States Virgin  Islands) held in  his name\n          or on  his behalf,  or on  behalf of  any\n          entity  as  to  which   he  is  the  true\n          beneficiary.    (The  monies so  held  on\n          behalf  of  Mr. McNichols  and  Thomas H.\n          McNichols are believed to be in excess of\n          $600,000.00).    Mr.   McNichols  further\n          agrees   promptly  to   take  all   steps\n          necessary to  place  any  of  the  above-\n          described monies  within the  custody and\n          control  of  the  United   States.    Mr.\n          McNichols  also agrees  to hold  harmless\n          any  person,  corporation or  bank  which\n          assists the  United States  in recovering\n          such monies.\n\n             Any  monies recovered  in this  manner\n          shall be  held in escrow  in an interest-\n          bearing account in the name of the Office\n          or  by the  Clerk of the  District Court.\n          Should  it  be determined  by a  court of\n          appropriate  jurisdiction   (e.g.  United\n          States  Tax   Court),  or   by  agreement\n          between the  parties, that  Mr. McNichols\n          owes any taxes,  interest or penalties to\n          the United States, then the Office agrees\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          that any of the  recovered monies held in\n          the above-described escrow  account which\n          were once held on behalf of Mr. McNichols\n          will  be  paid  to the  Internal  Revenue\n          Service  in partial  satisfaction of  any\n          tax debt  owed by Mr. McNichols.   Should\n          it be determined  that Mr. McNichols owes\n          no  taxes,  interest, or  penalties,  the\n          recovered  monies shall  be forfeited  to\n          the  United  States.   In that  case, Mr.\n          McNichols  will  provide  any  assistance\n          requested of him to forfeit the recovered\n          monies to the United States.\n\n             8.    The   United  States  Attorney's\n          Office makes no  promises with respect to\n          any civil tax  liability incurred by  Mr.\n          McNichols  (with  the  exception  of  the\n          promise  made in paragraph  7 above).  To\n          the extent permitted under all applicable\n          laws and  regulations, the  United States\n          Attorney's Office will recommend that the\n          Internal  Revenue  Service  not  seek  to\n          satisy  [sic]   any  tax   assessment  by\n          levying and forfeiting the house and real\n          property at  12 Edgemont  Street, Boston,\n          Massachusetts.   The  United States  does\n          not  in any  way  represent that  it  can\n          prevent the Internal Revenue Service from\n          levying on the above-described property.\n\n          On  October   21,  a  judgment  of  conviction  was\n\nentered.   Pursuant to that judgment petitioner was sentenced\n\nto ten years incarceration and is now serving  that sentence.\n\n          The case before  the tax court was  submitted fully\n\nstipulated  along with  joint  exhibits.   Taxpayer conceded:\n\nthat \"[d]uring the taxable years 1981  and 1982, [he] derived\n\ntaxable  income and incurred  costs from the  importation and\n\nsale  of marijuana\";  that  he  \"did not  report  any of  the\n\ntaxable income received  or costs incurred  from the sale  of\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nmarijuana . . .  on his federal  income tax returns for  [the\n\n1981 and 1982] taxable years\"; and that \"[i]n connection with\n\n[his] illegal  drug activities,  [he] did  not maintain  and,\n\ntherefore, could not  submit complete and accurate  books and\n\nrecords  of his income  producing activities for  the taxable\n\nyears 1981 and  1982 as required by the applicable provisions\n\nof  the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated\n\nthereunder.\"   In addition, the  taxpayer agreed that  he had\n\n\"fraudulently,and with intent  to evade  tax omitted  taxable\n\nincome from  his federal  tax returns for  the taxable  years\n\n1981 and  1982,\" and that  \"[a] part of the  underpayments of\n\ntax which was required to be shown in his federal income  tax\n\nreturns  for the  taxable  years  1981 and  1982  was due  to\n\nfraud.\"   Taxpayer also stipulated that  he had purchased two\n\nshell  companies, opened various  bank accounts in  behalf of\n\nthese   companies,  and  had  \"deposited,  or  caused  to  be\n\ndeposited\"  over   $1,720,565  into  these   companies'  bank\n\naccounts during 1981 and 1982.  \n\n          Based on the  stipulated facts the tax  court found\n\nthe  petitioner  liable  for tax  deficiencies  and additions\n\nthereto for the  years 1981 and 1982  in the total  amount of\n\n$1,169,699.00.  This appeal followed.  We affirm.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Petitioner contends that the imposition by  the IRS\n\nof the  tax deficiencies  and additions  thereto on  property\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nalready forfeited to the  government constitutes an excessive\n\nfine under the Eighth Amendment and double jeopardy under the\n\nFifth Amendment.\n\n          Although it  could be  argued that  under the  plea\n\nagreement petitioner  agreed  to  accept  the  assessment  of\n\nincome taxes  due we will  do, as the parties  have done, and\n\naddress the merits of petitioner's appeal.  Petitioner relies\n\nprimarily on two recent Supreme Court cases, Austin v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,       U.S.     ,  113 S. Ct.  2801 (1993)  and United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989).\n                \n\n          Austin  was a forfeiture case.  Austin was indicted\n                \n\nand subsequently pleaded guilty in a South Dakota state court\n\nto one count of possessing cocaine and was sentenced to seven\n\nyears imprisonment.  Shortly after he pled guilty  the United\n\nStates filed a forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C.    881(a)(4)\n\nand (a)(7)  in  the United  States District  Court for  South\n\nDakota  seeking forfeiture of  Austin's mobile home  and auto\n\nbody shop.  Austin, 113 S. Ct. at 2803.  The Court found that\n                  \n\nthe  Excessive Fines Clause  of the Eighth  Amendment was not\n\nlimited  to  criminal  actions.   It  phrased  the  issue  as\n\nfollows:   \"the question is  not, as the United  States would\n\nhave it, whether forfeiture under     881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is\n\ncivil or criminal, but rather whether it is punishment.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 2806.   The Court found  that historically forfeiture  was\n\nviewed  as punishment.   It then found  that because Congress\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n\"has chosen to  tie forfeiture directly to the  commission of\n\ndrug  offenses\"  the  forfeiture  statutes were  punitive  in\n\nnature, and were  \"subject to the  limitations of the  Eighth\n\nAmendment's Excessive Fines Clause.\"  Id. at 2812.  The Court\n                                         \n\nrefused to  establish  a  multifactor  test  for  determining\n\nwhether a  forfeiture is constitutionally excessive, but left\n\nthat for  the lower courts to work out in the first instance.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          Using Austin  as a  springboard, petitioner  argues\n                      \n\nthat the additions to the income tax were punitive, and that,\n\nby  seizing  his  property  and  then  subjecting  that  same\n\nproperty to an income tax along with penalties and  interest,\n\nthe  IRS has violated the proportionality requirements of the\n\nEighth Amendment.   We  decline to take  the giant  leap that\n\npetitioner  urges for  several reasons.   First  there  is an\n\ninsurmountable wall of  tax cases,  discussed infra,  holding\n                                                   \n\nthat  the government has a right  to do precisely what it has\n\ndone here.   Second, the instant  case is a  civil income tax\n\nnot a  forfeiture case as  was Austin.   And Austin  does not\n                                                   \n\ndirectly  or impliedly  suggest that  either  its holding  or\n\nstatements  to  the  effect  that  a  forfeiture  can  be  an\n\nexcessive fine  under the Eighth  Amendment are or  should be\n\napplicable to  any actions  other than  forfeitures under  21\n\nU.S.C.    881(a)(4) and (a)(7).  Nor, under the facts of this\n\ncase, do we perceive any  reason for applying the  principles\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nof   Austin  to  petitioner.     Petitioner  agreed   to  the\n           \n\nforfeiture.  He  stipulated to the tax court  that he derived\n\nunreported taxable income  in 1981 and 1982 from  the sale of\n\nmarijuana.   The plea agreement warned petitioner that income\n\ntax  might  be  due.    Indeed, prior  to  signing  the  plea\n\nagreement,  petitioner   was  sent  a  notice  of  deficiency\n\nassessing  taxes and penalties  for the years  1981 and 1982.\n\nThe Supreme  Court in  James v. United  States, 366  U.S. 213\n                                              \n\n(1961) made an observation that applies to petitioner:\n\n          We  should   not  continue   to  confound\n          confusion, particularly  when the  result\n          would be  to perpetuate the  injustice of\n          relieving  embezzlers  of   the  duty  of\n          paying  income  taxes on  the  money they\n          enrich  themselves  with   through  theft\n          while  honest people  pay their  taxes on\n          every conceivable type of income.\n\nId. at 221.  We find no Eighth Amendment violations.\n   \n\n          Petitioner's   claim  that   the  tax   assessment,\n\nincluding   penalties,    violates   the    Fifth   Amendment\n\nproscription against multiple punishments  is based on United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Halper.   In Halper, defendant was the manager of a\n                             \n\ncompany which provided medical services for patients eligible\n\nfor medicare  benefits.   He  submitted  sixty-five  separate\n\nfalse  claims for  services  rendered to  Blue  Cross &amp;  Blue\n\nShield  of  New  York City.    Blue  Cross overpaid  Halper's\n\ncompany a total  of $585 and passed the  overcharges along to\n\nthe  federal government.   Halper was indicted  on sixty-five\n\ncounts of  violating the False  Claims Act, 18 U.S.C.    287.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nHe  was convicted  on all  sixty-five  counts as  well as  on\n\nsixteen  counts  of   mail  fraud.    He   was  sentenced  to\n\nimprisonment for two years and fined $5,000. \n\n          The  government then  sued  Halper under  the civil\n\nFalse  Claims  Act.   Halper's  criminal  conviction  was, of\n\ncourse,  sufficient to  ground civil  liability.   Under  the\n\nprovisions of the statute, Halper was subject to a penalty of\n\nmore  than $130,000.   The  district court refused  to assess\n\nsuch  a  penalty, holding  that  to  do  so would  result  in\n\npunishment barred by the double jeopardy clause.  The Supreme\n\nCourt  affirmed.   The  Court  pointed  out that  the  double\n\njeopardy protection was \"intrinsically personal.\"\n\n          Its violation  can be identified  only by\n          assessing  the  character of  the  actual\n          sanctions  imposed on  the individual  by\n          the machinery of the state.\n             In making this  assessment, the labels\n          \"criminal\"   and  \"civil\"   are  not   of\n          paramount  importance.   It  is  commonly\n          understood  that  civil  proceedings  may\n          advance  punitive  as  well  as  remedial\n          goals,   and,   conversely,   that   both\n          punitive and remedial goals may be served\n          by criminal penalties.\n\nUnited States v. Halper, 490 U.S. at  447.  The Court went on\n                       \n\nto say:\n\n          To that end, the determination whether  a\n          given    civil    sanction    constitutes\n          punishment in the relevant sense requires\n          a   particularized   assessment   of  the\n          penalty imposed and the purposes that the\n          penalty  may  fairly  be  said to  serve.\n          Simply put, a civil as well as a criminal\n          sanction constitutes punishment  when the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          sanction  as  applied in  the  individual\n          case serves the goals of punishment.\n\nId. at 448.\n   \n\n          We recognize  that the  language of  the Court  may\n\nplay an appealing tune to one in petitioner's straits but the\n\ncase is  inapposite.   Halper involved  a specific  statutory\n                             \n\npenalty.    The  circumstances  giving  rise  to  the  double\n\njeopardy violation were unique.   To use Halper as a base for\n                                               \n\nvaulting into the tax arena would be to misapply the case and\n\ndistort  its holding.    We  hold that  there  was no  double\n\njeopardy violation.\n\n          Petitioner has also cited to  bits and pieces of  a\n\nnumber of other cases in  an effort to bolster his arguments.\n\nWe have  examined them all and  find they do not  advance his\n\nclaims by even one step.\n\n                             III.\n\n          We now outline the wall  of cases that bars the way\n\nto  any defense  by petitioner  to  the judgment  of the  Tax\n\nCourt.   Helvering v. Mitchell,  303 U.S. 391 (1938),  is the\n                              \n\nfoundation  stone for  the  wall.   The  Court  held that  an\n\nacquittal on the criminal charge of a wilful attempt to evade\n\ntaxes does not bar assessment and collection of the 50% civil\n\npenalty.   The Court rejected defendant's contention that the\n\n50% addition to the tax was not a tax but a  criminal penalty\n\nintended as  punishment.  Id. at  399-400.  It held  that the\n                             \n\n50% addition was remedial:\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          The  remedial   character  of   sanctions\n          imposing additions to a tax has been made\n          clear  by  this  Court  in  passing  upon\n          similar legislation.   They  are provided\n          primarily   as   a  safeguard   for   the\n          protection   of   the  revenue   and   to\n          reimburse  the Government  for the  heavy\n          expense  of  investigation and  the  loss\n          resulting from the taxpayer's fraud.\n\nId. at 40l.

United States, the Court stated:\n                                   \n\n             When  a  taxpayer  acquires  earnings,\n          lawfully  or   unlawfully,  without   the\n          consensual   recognition,   express    or\n          implied, of  an obligation  to repay  and\n          without   restriction    as   to    their\n          disposition,  \"he  has   received  income\n          which he  is  required  to  return,  even\n          though it may still be claimed that he is\n          not  entitled  to retain  the  money, and\n          even though  he  may  still  be  adjudged\n          liable to restore its equivalent.\"  North\n                                                   \n          American Oil v. Brunet, supra, at p. 424.\n                                       \n\n366 U.S. at 219.  Further, the Court  noted that Congress did\n\nnot  intend to treat a law-breaking taxpayer differently from\n\na law-abiding one.  Id. at 220.\n                       \n\n          There  are  also  some  significant  circuit  court\n\ncases.  In Karpa v. C.I.R., 909 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1990), the\n                          \n\nFourth Circuit held that the retroactive  imposition of a tax\n\npenalty for  substantial understatement of  tax liability did\n\nnot violate  the ex  post facto  clause of  the Constitution.\n\nAfter discussing Halper,  the court ruled that  the increased\n                       \n\ntax penalty  was a civil  sanction and therefore the  ex post\n\nfacto prohibition  was not implicated.   Karpa,  909 F.2d  at\n                                              \n\n788.  \n\n          In  Traficant v.  C.I.R., 884  F.2d  258 (6th  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989),  the petitioner  argued that  his  prior acquittal  on\n\ncriminal  charges of  bribery precluded  the  tax court  from\n\nfinding that he  took bribes.  Relying heavily  on Helvering,\n                                                            \n\nthe Sixth Circuit upheld the  tax court's ruling that neither\n\nissue  preclusion  nor  double  jeopardy  foreclosed  such  a\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nfinding because the  tax case was a civil  proceeding and the\n\nburden of proof different than the one required in a criminal\n\ncase.\n\n          Wood  v.  United  States, 863  F.2d  417  (5th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989), is very similar to the case at bar.  As  here, the IRS\n\nhad imposed a tax on proceeds that had been  forfeited to the\n\ngovernment.    Wood  argued   that  this  was  \"fundamentally\n\nunfair.\"   In  words that  are directly applicable  here, the\n\ncourt rejected Wood's claim:\n\n          There is  no dispute that  Wood exercised\n          complete  dominion and  control over  the\n          proceeds  from the  drug  smuggling.   It\n          does not matter that  by operation of law\n          all  right  and   title  vested  in   the\n          government  as  soon  as  the  money  was\n          earned.\n\n                            . . .\n\n          The  legal  test  for  taxable income  is\n          dominion and  control, and  that test  in\n          its terms excludes  consideration of what\n          happens to income after it flows from the\n          taxpayer's hands.\n\nId. at 419.\n   \n\n          Our  final case is  Kenney v. C.I.R.,  111 F.2d 374\n                                              \n\n(5th Cir. 1940).  Its holding speaks for itself:\n\n             The   imposition   of    civil   fraud\n          penalties is not prohibited by the  Fifth\n          Amendment to  the Constitution  by reason\n          of  the  petitioner's  having  previously\n          plead guilty to  such indictment, because\n          the penalty imposed  by Section 293(b) is\n          a  civil  and  not  a  criminal  penalty.\n          Helvering v.  Mitchell, 303 U.S.  391, 58\n                                \n          S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nId. at 375-76.\n   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n                             IV.\n\n          As a final issue, petitioner argues that the public\n\npolicy that supports  rehabilitation outweighs the  pecuniary\n\ninterests of  the IRS.   It is  difficult to  understand what\n\nthis means  and how it is  relevant.  We can  only conjecture\n\nthat  petitioner suggests  that if  he does  not have  to pay\n\nincome tax and additions thereto on his  ill-gotten gains, he\n\nwill be better  prepared to again live in the  style that his\n\ndrug dealing made possible after he finishes his prison term.\n\nThis is  somewhat akin to  the defendant who had  killed both\n\nhis parents  asking mercy  from the court  because he  was an\n\norphan.\n\n          The judgment of  the Tax Court is  affirmed.

The tax court also found petitioner liable for additions to the tax due.  The amounts are substantial, but the computations are not contested.  The tax court brushed aside petitioner's main defense, that imposition of the deficiencies and additions to tax violates the proscription against excessive fines of the Eighth Amendment and violates the Double Jeopardy protection against multiple punishments under the Fifth Amendment.

The interest on the tax and additions thereto continue to accrue.  As of January 26, 1990, petitioner's tax liability totalled $2,422,963.94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 1988, petitioner entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney whereby he agreed to plead guilty to all the counts in the indictment in which he was named.  He also agreed to forfeit all right, title and interest in the properties described in the indictment.  Petitioner claims that the value of the forfeited property is \"approximately $1,200,000.\"  (Brief at 3.)   The pertinent provisions of the plea agreement provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7.  Mr. McNichols agrees to relinquish all right, title or interest in any monies held in any foreign bank accounts (or those located in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands) held in his name or on his behalf, or on behalf of any entity as to which he is the true beneficiary.  (The monies so held on behalf of Mr. McNichols and Thomas H. McNichols are believed to be in excess of $600,000.00).  Mr. McNichols further agrees promptly to take all steps necessary to place any of the above-described monies within the custody and control of the United States.  Mr. McNichols also agrees to hold harmless any person, corporation or bank which assists the United States in recovering such monies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any monies recovered in this manner shall be held in escrow in an interest-bearing account in the name of the Office or by the Clerk of the District Court.  Should it be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (e.g. United States Tax Court), or by agreement between the parties, that Mr. McNichols owes any taxes, interest or penalties to the United States, then the Office agrees that any of the recovered monies held in the above-described escrow account which were once held on behalf of Mr. McNichols will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service in partial satisfaction of any tax debt owed by Mr. McNichols.  Should it be determined that Mr. McNichols owes no taxes, interest, or penalties, the recovered monies shall be forfeited to the United States.

Petitioner relies primarily on two recent Supreme Court cases, Austin v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) and United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Austin was a forfeiture case.  Austin was indicted and subsequently pleaded guilty in a South Dakota state court to one count of possessing cocaine and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.  Shortly after he pled guilty the United States filed a forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) in the United States District Court for South Dakota seeking forfeiture of Austin's mobile home and auto body shop.  Austin, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2803.   The Court found that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment was not limited to criminal actions.  It phrased the issue as follows:  \"the question is not, as the United States would have it, whether forfeiture under Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal, but rather whether it is punishment.\"  Id. --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2806.   The Court found that historically forfeiture was viewed as punishment.  It then found that because Congress \"has chosen to tie forfeiture directly to the commission of drug offenses\" the forfeiture statutes were punitive in nature, and were \"subject to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.\"  Id. --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2812.   The Court refused to establish a multifactor test for determining whether a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive, but left that for the lower courts to work out in the first instance.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using Austin as a springboard, petitioner argues that the additions to the income tax were punitive, and that, by seizing his property and then subjecting that same property to an income tax along with penalties and interest, the IRS has violated the proportionality requirements of the Eighth Amendment.  We decline to take the giant leap that petitioner urges for several reasons.  First there is an insurmountable wall of tax cases, discussed infra, holding that the government has a right to do precisely what it has done here.  Second, the instant case is a civil income tax not a forfeiture case as was Austin.   And Austin does not directly or impliedly suggest that either its holding or statements to the effect that a forfeiture can be an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment are or should be applicable to any actions other than forfeitures under 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).  Nor, under the facts of this case, do we perceive any reason for applying the principles of Austin to petitioner.  Petitioner agreed to the forfeiture.  He stipulated to the tax court that he derived unreported taxable income in 1981 and 1982 from the sale of marijuana.  The plea agreement warned petitioner that income tax might be due.  Indeed, prior to signing the plea agreement, petitioner was sent a notice of deficiency assessing taxes and penalties for the years 1981 and 1982.  The Supreme Court in James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) made an observation that applies to petitioner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>We should not continue to confound confusion, particularly when the result would be to perpetuate the injustice of relieving embezzlers of the duty of paying income taxes on the money they enrich themselves with through theft while honest people pay their taxes on every conceivable type of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 221, 81 S.Ct. at 1056.   We find no Eighth Amendment violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's claim that the tax assessment, including penalties, violates the Fifth Amendment proscription against multiple punishments is based on United States v. Halper.   In Halper, defendant was the manager of a company which provided medical services for patients eligible for medicare benefits.  He submitted sixty-five separate false claims for services rendered to Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of New York City.  Blue Cross overpaid Halper's company a total of $585 and passed the overcharges along to the federal government.  Halper was indicted on sixty-five counts of violating the False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 287.  He was convicted on all sixty-five counts as well as on sixteen counts of mail fraud.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and fined $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then sued Halper under the civil False Claims Act.  Halper's criminal conviction was, of course, sufficient to ground civil liability.  Under the provisions of the statute, Halper was subject to a penalty of more than $130,000.  The district court refused to assess such a penalty, holding that to do so would result in punishment barred by the double jeopardy clause.  The Supreme Court affirmed.  The Court pointed out that the double jeopardy protection was \"intrinsically personal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Its violation can be identified only by assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed on the individual by the machinery of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this assessment, the labels \"criminal\" and \"civil\" are not of paramount importance.  It is commonly understood that civil proceedings may advance punitive as well as remedial goals, and, conversely, that both punitive and remedial goals may be served by criminal penalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. at 447, 109 S.Ct. at 1901.

Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938), is the foundation stone for the wall.  The Court held that an acquittal on the criminal charge of a wilful attempt to evade taxes does not bar assessment and collection of the 50% civil penalty.  The Court rejected defendant's contention that the 50% addition to the tax was not a tax but a criminal penalty intended as punishment.  Id. at 399-400, 58 S.Ct. at 633.   It held that the 50% addition was remedial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The remedial character of sanctions imposing additions to a tax has been made clear by this Court in passing upon similar legislation.  They are provided primarily as a safeguard for the protection of the revenue and to reimburse the Government for the heavy expense of investigation and the loss resulting from the taxpayer's fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 401, 58 S.Ct. at 634.

United States, the Court stated:When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, \"he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.\"  North American Oil v. Burnet, supra, [286 U.S. 417], at p. 424 [52 S.Ct. 613, at p. 615, 76 L.Ed. 1197] [ (1932) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">366 U.S. at 219, 81 S.Ct. at 1055.   Further, the Court noted that Congress did not intend to treat a law-breaking taxpayer differently from a law-abiding one.  Id. at 220, 81 S.Ct. at 1056.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are also some significant circuit court cases.  In Karpa v. C.I.R., 909 F.2d 784 (4th Cir.1990), the Fourth Circuit held that the retroactive imposition of a tax penalty for substantial understatement of tax liability did not violate the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  After discussing Halper, the court ruled that the increased tax penalty was a civil sanction and therefore the ex post facto prohibition was not implicated.  Karpa, 909 F.2d at 788.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Traficant v. C.I.R., 884 F.2d 258 (6th Cir.1989), the petitioner argued that his prior acquittal on criminal charges of bribery precluded the tax court from finding that he took bribes.  Relying heavily on Helvering, the Sixth Circuit upheld the tax court's ruling that neither issue preclusion nor double jeopardy foreclosed such a finding because the tax case was a civil proceeding and the burden of proof different than the one required in a criminal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood v. United States, 863 F.2d 417 (5th Cir.1989), is very similar to the case at bar.  As here, the IRS had imposed a tax on proceeds that had been forfeited to the government.  Wood argued that this was \"fundamentally unfair.\"   In words that are directly applicable here, the court rejected Wood's claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There is no dispute that Wood exercised complete dominion and control over the proceeds from the drug smuggling.

C.I.R., 111 F.2d 374 (5th Cir.1940).  Its holding speaks for itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imposition of civil fraud penalties is not prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution by reason of the petitioner's having previously plead guilty to such indictment, because the penalty imposed by Section 293(b) is a civil and not a criminal penalty.  Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 375-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final issue, petitioner argues that the public policy that supports rehabilitation outweighs the pecuniary interests of the IRS.  It is difficult to understand what this means and how it is relevant.  We can only conjecture that petitioner suggests that if he does not have to pay income tax and additions thereto on his ill-gotten gains, he will be better prepared to again live in the style that his drug dealing made possible after he finishes his prison term.  This is somewhat akin to the defendant who had killed both his parents asking mercy from the court because he was an orphan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.

The tax court also found petitioner liable for additions to the tax due.  The amounts are substantial, but the computations are not contested.  The tax court brushed aside petitioner's main defense, that imposition of the deficiencies and additions to tax violates the proscription against excessive fines of the Eighth Amendment and violates the Double Jeopardy protection against multiple punishments under the Fifth Amendment.

In October 1987 petitioner was indicted along with Frederick A. Carroll on a number of criminal charges:  distribution of and conspiracy to distribute marijuana;  violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1962 and 1963;  conspiracy to defraud the United States;  and subscribing to false tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 1988 the Internal Revenue Service sent a notice of deficiency to petitioner assessing deficiencies in income and additions to tax for the years 1981 and 1982.  The interest on the tax and additions thereto continue to accrue.  As of January 26, 1990, petitioner's tax liability totalled $2,422,963.94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 1988, petitioner entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney whereby he agreed to plead guilty to all the counts in the indictment in which he was named.  He also agreed to forfeit all right, title and interest in the properties described in the indictment.  Petitioner claims that the value of the forfeited property is \"approximately $1,200,000.\"  (Brief at 3.)   The pertinent provisions of the plea agreement provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7.  Mr. McNichols agrees to relinquish all right, title or interest in any monies held in any foreign bank accounts (or those located in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands) held in his name or on his behalf, or on behalf of any entity as to which he is the true beneficiary.  (The monies so held on behalf of Mr. McNichols and Thomas H. McNichols are believed to be in excess of $600,000.00).  Mr. McNichols further agrees promptly to take all steps necessary to place any of the above-described monies within the custody and control of the United States.  Mr. McNichols also agrees to hold harmless any person, corporation or bank which assists the United States in recovering such monies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any monies recovered in this manner shall be held in escrow in an interest-bearing account in the name of the Office or by the Clerk of the District Court.  Should it be determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction (e.g. United States Tax Court), or by agreement between the parties, that Mr. McNichols owes any taxes, interest or penalties to the United States, then the Office agrees that any of the recovered monies held in the above-described escrow account which were once held on behalf of Mr. McNichols will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service in partial satisfaction of any tax debt owed by Mr. McNichols.  Should it be determined that Mr. McNichols owes no taxes, interest, or penalties, the recovered monies shall be forfeited to the United States.

The United States Attorney's Office makes no promises with respect to any civil tax liability incurred by Mr. McNichols (with the exception of the promise made in paragraph 7 above).  To the extent permitted under all applicable laws and regulations, the United States Attorney's Office will recommend that the Internal Revenue Service not seek to satisy [sic] any tax assessment by levying and forfeiting the house and real property at 12 Edgemont Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

Austin was indicted and subsequently pleaded guilty in a South Dakota state court to one count of possessing cocaine and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.  Shortly after he pled guilty the United States filed a forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) in the United States District Court for South Dakota seeking forfeiture of Austin's mobile home and auto body shop.  Austin, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2803.   The Court found that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment was not limited to criminal actions.  It phrased the issue as follows:  \"the question is not, as the United States would have it, whether forfeiture under Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal, but rather whether it is punishment.\"  Id. --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2806.   The Court found that historically forfeiture was viewed as punishment.  It then found that because Congress \"has chosen to tie forfeiture directly to the commission of drug offenses\" the forfeiture statutes were punitive in nature, and were \"subject to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.\"  Id. --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2812.   The Court refused to establish a multifactor test for determining whether a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive, but left that for the lower courts to work out in the first instance.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using Austin as a springboard, petitioner argues that the additions to the income tax were punitive, and that, by seizing his property and then subjecting that same property to an income tax along with penalties and interest, the IRS has violated the proportionality requirements of the Eighth Amendment.  We decline to take the giant leap that petitioner urges for several reasons.  First there is an insurmountable wall of tax cases, discussed infra, holding that the government has a right to do precisely what it has done here.  Second, the instant case is a civil income tax not a forfeiture case as was Austin.   And Austin does not directly or impliedly suggest that either its holding or statements to the effect that a forfeiture can be an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment are or should be applicable to any actions other than forfeitures under 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).  Nor, under the facts of this case, do we perceive any reason for applying the principles of Austin to petitioner.  Petitioner agreed to the forfeiture.  He stipulated to the tax court that he derived unreported taxable income in 1981 and 1982 from the sale of marijuana.  The plea agreement warned petitioner that income tax might be due.  Indeed, prior to signing the plea agreement, petitioner was sent a notice of deficiency assessing taxes and penalties for the years 1981 and 1982.  The Supreme Court in James v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106235\"><a href=\"/opinion/106235/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106235\"><a href=\"/opinion/106235/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Halper.   In Halper, defendant was the manager of a company which provided medical services for patients eligible for medicare benefits.  He submitted sixty-five separate false claims for services rendered to Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of New York City.  Blue Cross overpaid Halper's company a total of $585 and passed the overcharges along to the federal government.  Halper was indicted on sixty-five counts of violating the False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 287.  He was convicted on all sixty-five counts as well as on sixteen counts of mail fraud.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and fined $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then sued Halper under the civil False Claims Act.  Halper's criminal conviction was, of course, sufficient to ground civil liability.  Under the provisions of the statute, Halper was subject to a penalty of more than $130,000.  The district court refused to assess such a penalty, holding that to do so would result in punishment barred by the double jeopardy clause.  The Supreme Court affirmed.  The Court pointed out that the double jeopardy protection was \"intrinsically personal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Its violation can be identified only by assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed on the individual by the machinery of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this assessment, the labels \"criminal\" and \"civil\" are not of paramount importance.

Helvering v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102987\"><a href=\"/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102987\"><a href=\"/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span> (1938), is the foundation stone for the wall.  The Court held that an acquittal on the criminal charge of a wilful attempt to evade taxes does not bar assessment and collection of the 50% civil penalty.  The Court rejected defendant's contention that the 50% addition to the tax was not a tax but a criminal penalty intended as punishment.  Id. at 399-400, 58 S.Ct. at 633.   It held that the 50% addition was remedial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The remedial character of sanctions imposing additions to a tax has been made clear by this Court in passing upon similar legislation.  They are provided primarily as a safeguard for the protection of the revenue and to reimburse the Government for the heavy expense of investigation and the loss resulting from the taxpayer's fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 401, 58 S.Ct. at 634.

United States, the Court stated:When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, \"he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.\"  North American Oil v.

Further, the Court noted that Congress did not intend to treat a law-breaking taxpayer differently from a law-abiding one.  Id. at 220, 81 S.Ct. at 1056.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are also some significant circuit court cases.  In Karpa v. C.I.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545502\"><a href=\"/opinion/545502/jay-n-karpa-elizabeth-j-karpa-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1990), the Fourth Circuit held that the retroactive imposition of a tax penalty for substantial understatement of tax liability did not violate the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  After discussing Halper, the court ruled that the increased tax penalty was a civil sanction and therefore the ex post facto prohibition was not implicated.  Karpa, 909 F.2d at 788.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Traficant v.

Relying heavily on Helvering, the Sixth Circuit upheld the tax court's ruling that neither issue preclusion nor double jeopardy foreclosed such a finding because the tax case was a civil proceeding and the burden of proof different than the one required in a criminal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood v.

As here, the IRS had imposed a tax on proceeds that had been forfeited to the government.  Wood argued that this was \"fundamentally unfair.\"   In words that are directly applicable here, the court rejected Wood's claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There is no dispute that Wood exercised complete dominion and control over the proceeds from the drug smuggling.

Its holding speaks for itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imposition of civil fraud penalties is not prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution by reason of the petitioner's having previously plead guilty to such indictment, because the penalty imposed by Section 293(b) is a civil and not a criminal penalty.  Helvering v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102987\"><a href=\"/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102987\"><a href=\"/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is difficult to understand what this means and how it is relevant.  We can only conjecture that petitioner suggests that if he does not have to pay income tax and additions thereto on his ill-gotten gains, he will be better prepared to again live in the style that his drug dealing made possible after he finishes his prison term.  This is somewhat akin to the defendant who had killed both his parents asking mercy from the court because he was an orphan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.
