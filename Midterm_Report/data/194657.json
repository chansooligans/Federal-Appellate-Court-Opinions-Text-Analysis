In  the  district court,  152\n                            \n\nbuyers  of lots of undeveloped real estate in Florida charged\n\nthe real estate company, the  bank that financed the company,\n\nand certain individuals with  securities fraud under RICO, 18\n\nU.S.C.   1962(c).1   Describing their land  sale contracts as\n\n\"securities,\" the  buyers claimed  that their  purchases were\n\ninduced by  false representations that the  land was suitable\n\nfor home sites and that  the surrounding areas would  develop\n\ninto  a thriving community.  In fact, the property turned out\n\nto  be worthless swamp land  unfit for development.   After a\n\nlengthy jury trial, the district court directed a verdict for\n\nthe defendants, ruling that the  land sale contracts were not\n\nsecurities.    The buyers  appeal.   We  affirm  the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\n\n     The underlying facts, viewing  the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to  the buyers,  can be briefly  stated.   The\n\nbuyers, most of whom  are residents of Puerto Rico,  acquired\n\ntheir lots in  Florida beginning  in the  early 1970's  after\n\nbeing  approached   by  the   real  estate   company's  sales\n\nrepresentatives.    During  these meetings,  the  prospective\n\n                    \n\n     1RICO  is   the  Racketeering  Influenced   and  Corrupt\nOrganizations chapter  of the Organized Crime  Control Act of\n1970, 18 U.S.C.    1961-68.  The real estate company was J.C.\nInvestments,  Inc.    The  original financing  was  by  Banco\nEconomias  and a group of investors.  Banco Central succeeded\nBanco Economias.  \n\n                             -2-\n\nbuyers were offered  the opportunity  to purchase  subdivided\n\nlots  in an undeveloped site that would eventually, they were\n\ntold, include roads, schools, churches, stores and  elaborate\n\nrecreational  facilities.    The  project was  touted  as  an\n\nexcellent investment due not only to prospective development,\n\nbut also to its close proximity to  Disney World.  These oral\n\nassurances  were bolstered by promotional brochures depicting\n\nsporting activities at nearby locations  and other literature\n\ninforming buyers of the development's progress.\n\n     A cautionary statement, written in small print in one of\n\nthe promotional brochures,  advised that the  development was\n\n\"not  a homesite  offering.\"   Another  pamphlet warned  that\n\n\"[i]mprovements such as roads  and drainage are not presently\n\non  the property  and  are not  contemplated.\"   Yet  another\n\nwarning,  this one  prominently  featured in  a Florida  Land\n\nSales  Board Offering  Statement and  included as  well  in a\n\nbrochure, advised buyers that the property was not usable for\n\nbuilding purposes,  that  the  seller  neither  promised  nor\n\ncontemplated any improvements, and  that 35% of the  land was\n\n\"marshy or swampy\" and subject to flooding.\n\n     Most buyers  did not read  these warnings and  those who\n\ndid  were   often  told  that  the   warnings  were  standard\n\nboilerplate  required for  all Florida  land sales.   Another\n\nresponse was that the  swampy sites would be drained  and the\n\nwater  diverted  to  form  ponds  and  lakes.    The  buyers,\n\n                             -3-\n\naccording to  their testimony,  were assured that  their land\n\ncould be  used as  a  home site  or  for any  other  purpose.\n\nSeveral  chose  their  lots  from a  map  which  divided  the\n\ndevelopment  into \"residential\"  and \"commercial\"  sections. \n\nThe vast majority  of buyers, many of whom hoped to retire to\n\nFlorida, purchased their lots  with the intention of building\n\na  home.   According  to their  testimony,  only a  few  were\n\nconcerned solely with the re-sale value of their property and\n\nhad  no  intention  of residing  on  or  developing  the lots\n\nthemselves.\n\n     The projected  improvements were  not made.   The buyers\n\neventually learned, some through a local newspaper, that they\n\nwere  the  owners  of swamp  land  worth  a  fraction of  the\n\npurchase price.   At trial,  the buyers produced  experts who\n\ntestified that, as a result of zoning restrictions applicable\n\nto  flood-prone  areas, few  of the  lots  could be  built on\n\nlegally.     The   experts   said  that,   even  absent   the\n\nrestrictions,  the  area was  physically  unsuitable for  any\n\nbroad-scale development.\n\n     On  August  2, 1982,  the  buyers  brought  suit in  the\n\ndistrict  court,  making  claims   against  the  real  estate\n\ncompany,  the financing  bank, and  a number  of individuals.\n\nThe complaint asserted claims under the Interstate Land Sales\n\nFull  Disclosure  Act,  15  U.S.C.      1701  et   seq.,  the\n                                                      \n\nSecurities Exchange  Act, section 10(b), 15  U.S.C.   78j(b),\n\n                             -4-\n\nand RICO, 18  U.S.C.   1962(a)  (use of racketeering  derived\n\nincome).   Much time was consumed with class action disputes,\n\ndiscovery,  statute   of  limitations  issues,   and  various\n\nattempts to  amend the  complaint.  Eventually,  the district\n\ncourt in November 1989 dismissed all these claims but allowed\n\nthe buyers to amend in order to  allege a RICO claim charging\n\nsecurities  fraud as  predicate  acts.2   Rodriquez v.  Banco\n                                                             \n\nCentral,  727 F. Supp. 759  (D.P.R. 1989), aff'd  in part and\n                                                             \n\nvacated in part, 917 F.2d 664 (1st Cir. 1990).\n               \n\n     On  January  25, 1990,  the  district  court refused  to\n\ndismiss the  new  RICO  claim  based  on  predicate  acts  of\n\nsecurities fraud introduced by the new amended complaint.  At\n\nthe  same  time the  court declined  to  allow the  buyers to\n\nallege mail fraud under RICO.   The distinction, the district\n\ncourt explained, was that securities fraud had been  an issue\n\nin some form  from the  outset;3 mail fraud,  in the  court's\n\nview,  had  not  been  alleged  until  after seven  years  of\n\nlitigation, including extensive discovery.\n\n     Trial  commenced on  August  5, 1991,  and concluded  on\n\nSeptember  24, 1991.  The evidence submitted has already been\n\n                    \n\n     2The Land  Sales Act and Securities  Exchange Act claims\nwere dismissed on statute of  limitations grounds.  The  RICO\nclaim under    1962(a), charging use  of racketeering derived\nincome, was dismissed for lack of standing.\n\n     3In addition to the claim of  securities fraud under the\nSecurities  Act  of 1934,  the  original  complaint had  also\nmentioned securities  fraud as  part of the  improvident RICO\nclaim under 18 U.S.C.   1962(a).\n\n                             -5-\n\ndescribed briefly and  is discussed  further below.   At  the\n\nconclusion  of the evidence,  the court on  October 10, 1991,\n\ngranted a motion for judgment as  a matter of law and ordered\n\njudgment for all defendants,  Rodriguez v. Banco Central, 777\n                                                        \n\nF.  Supp. 1043  (D.P.R.  1991), giving  rise  to the  present\n\nappeal.   In  its  lengthy opinion,  the district  court held\n\ninter  alia that the land  sale contracts were not securities\n           \n\nunder  the  federal securities  laws.    In consequence,  the\n\nbuyers' RICO claim failed for lack of the necessary predicate\n\nacts.\n\n                     II. THE RICO CLAIMS\n\n     RICO  makes  it unlawful  for  a  person to  conduct  an\n\nenterprise  in or  affecting  interstate  commerce through  a\n\npattern  of \"racketeering  activity.\"   18 U.S.C.    1962(c).\n\n\"Racketeering activity\"  is defined to include  \"fraud in the\n\nsale of securities.\"   Id.    1961(1)(D).   For a  \"pattern,\"\n                         \n\nthere must  be  at least  two acts  of racketeering  activity\n\nwithin ten years of each other, id.   1961(5), here, fraud in\n                                  \n\nthe  sale of  securities.   In this  case, the  buyers  had a\n\nsufficient case of fraud to put before a  jury.  The question\n\nis whether it was fraud in the sale of \"securities.\"\n\n     The  district  court concluded  that no  reasonable jury\n\ncould  find  the  land sale  contracts  in  this  case to  be\n\n\"securities,\" a term that  the federal securities laws define\n\n                             -6-\n\nto include \"investment contracts.\"4   Rodriquez, 777 F. Supp.\n                                               \n\nat 1060-61.    Our analysis  on  appeal therefore  begins  by\n\nparsing  the terms  \"securities\" and  \"investment contracts,\"\n\ndistinguishing   them  from   other  forms  of   property  or\n\ncontractual arrangements.   This  legal furrow has  been well\n\nplowed  in  prior  opinions, but  imaginative  promoters  are\n\nconstantly devising new lures and promises to tempt investors\n\nand perplex the courts. \n\n     The  definition   of  \"investment  contract\"   has  been\n\nbracketed by a  set of Supreme  Court decisions which,  while\n\nthey  involve facts quite  different than ours,  mark out our\n\npath.   SEC v. W.J. Howey  Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) (interest\n                             \n\nin  citrus   enterprise  a  security);  and   United  Housing\n                                                             \n\nFoundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421  U.S. 837 (1975) (interest in\n                          \n\napartment  cooperative not a security).   In essence, we have\n\nbeen  told  by  these  cases  that  in  defining  securities,\n\nsubstance governs  form, and  the substance of  an investment\n\ncontract is a security-like interest in a \"common enterprise\"\n\nthat,  through  the efforts  of  the promoter  or  others, is\n\nexpected to generate profits  for the security holder, either\n\n                    \n\n     4The  courts have  construed  the  term \"securities\"  in\nlight  of  the  definitions  of  the  term  provided  by  the\nSecurities  Act  of 1933,  15 U.S.C.   77a  et seq.,  and the\n                                                  \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78a et seq.  See\n                                                             \nLandreth  Timber Co. v. Landreth,  471 U.S. 681  (1985).  The\n                                \ndefinitions  appear respectively  in  the  1933 Act,  section\n2(1),   15  U.S.C.     77b(1),  and  the  1934  Act,  section\n3(a)(10), 15 U.S.C.   78c(a)(10).\n\n                             -7-\n\nfor direct distribution or as an increase in the value of the\n\ninvestment.  Howey, 328  U.S. at 298-99; Forman, 421  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n852-53.\n\n     Each component  in the concept matters.   There are many\n\ninvestments obtained  by contract,  such as one's  home, that\n\nare not an  interest in an enterprise.    Forman, 421 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n858.    One   may  have  an  interest  in  an  enterprise--an\n\nemployment contract, for example--that is  not an entitlement\n\nto  profits or  increased  value.    Conversely,  in  a  sole\n\nproprietorship the owner could have a claim on all profits of\n\nthe enterprise  but there  might be no  contract or  security\n\ninvolved.    Further, the  Supreme  Court  cases mark  out  a\n\nconcept, not a precise definition.  The term \"securities,\" we\n       \n\nare   told,  must   be  flexibly   applied  to   capture  new\n\narrangements  comprising the  essence of  securities, however\n\nthey may  be named.   SEC v.  C.M. Joiner Leasing  Corp., 320\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 344, 351  (1943).  But not  all property is a  security,\n\nand fuzzy edges do not mean that the concept is unbounded.\n\n     In this case, apart from the generality of the statutory\n\nlanguage, a further, two-fold  problem exists in applying the\n\nconcept to the land sale contracts at issue.  First, what the\n\ncontracts say  is not all  that the  buyers were told  by the\n\nsalespersons; the  evidence  reveals that  many  buyers  were\n\nshown materials and given oral assurances that went beyond or\n\neven contradicted  the formal legal documents.   Second, what\n\n                             -8-\n\nthe  buyers  were   shown  or  told,   and  what  their   own\n\nunderstandings and  intentions  were, varied  from  buyer  to\n\nbuyer.  We start with some legal rules of thumb.\n\n     A simple sale of land, whether for investment or use, is\n\nnot a \"security.\"  E.g., Hocking v. Dubois, 839 F.2d 560, 564\n                                          \n\n(9th Cir. 1988),  modified on  reh'g en banc,  885 F.2d  1449\n                                            \n\n(9th Cir.  1989)  (en  banc), cert.  denied,  494  U.S.  1078\n                                           \n\n(1990).   Even if bought for investment, the land itself does\n\nnot  constitute a business  enterprise, and  \"securities\" are\n\ninterests  in  an enterprise.    Howey, 328  U.S.  at 298-99.\n                                      \n\nThus, one  who buys raw  land or  even a building,  hoping to\n\nprofit from rents  or the  natural increase in  the value  of\n\nproperty,  is  not  under  normal  circumstances  treated  as\n\npurchasing a  \"security.\"   Aldrich v.  McCulloch Properties,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  627   F.2d  1036,  1039   n.  1   (10th  Cir.   1980).\n   \n\nConventional incidentals,  such  as the  seller's promise  to\n\ninstall  a road or  electricity, is  similarly not  enough to\n\nelevate an  ordinary real estate transaction to the status of\n\na security.  Id. at 1040.  \n               \n\n     At  some point,  however, the  commitments and  promises\n\nincident to a land transfer, and the network of relationships\n\nrelated to the project, can cross  over the line and make the\n\ninterest acquired one in an ongoing business enterprise.  See\n                                                             \n\nHowey, 328  U.S. at 299-300.  At that point, the interest may\n     \n\nbe treated as  a security, even  if not so  labeled.  Id.  at\n                                                        \n\n                             -9-\n\n300.   And in making this appraisal, the promoter properly is\n\nheld to his representations as to what he is selling, Joiner,\n                                                            \n\n320 U.S. at 353, even where those promises go well beyond the\n\nlegal  terms of  the  contracts and  the  fine print  of  the\n\ndisclaimers.\n\n     In this case the promoters offered the land primarily as\n\nan  \"investment.\"  A number of buyers testified at trial that\n\nthe  salespeople  emphasized  the  investment  value  of  the\n\nproject, a  contention supported  by a company  sales' manual\n\nintroduced into evidence, stressing capital appreciation as a\n\nprime selling point.   Compare Rice v. Branigar Organization,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 922  F.2d 788, (11th Cir.  1991) (promotional materials\n   \n\nemphasized personal use over  investment).  A complication is\n\nnow introduced:  while the lots were offered as an investment\n\nby the seller, most  buyers intended to live on  the property\n\nand  purchased  primarily for  use.   A  purchase for  use or\n\nconsumption, it  is  said, is  not a  security or  investment\n\ncontract.  Forman, 421 U.S. at  852-53.  We need not sort out\n                 \n\nthe  problem of  opposing  buyer and  seller viewpoints,  nor\n\nsearch out buyers who had investment in mind, because another\n\naspect of the matter decides the case.\n\n     In our  view even if every buyer  bought for investment,\n\nwhat was purchased in this case was not a share of a business\n\nenterprise and so not  a security.  Taking the  evidence most\n\nfavorably to the  buyers, they were  sold land in  individual\n\n                             -10-\n\nparcels  with  strong  and  repeated   suggestions  that  the\n\nsurrounding  area would develop  into a  thriving residential\n\ncommunity.  But apart  from the promise of an  existing lodge\n\nor a new  country club, the  evidence did not  show that  the\n\npromoter  or  any  other   obligated  person  or  entity  was\n\npromising the buyers  to build  or provide anything.   A  few\n\nscraps of  evidence, usually  ambiguous, may point  the other\n\nway but we do not think that a reasonable jury could conclude\n\non  this  record  that   the  defendants  were  promising  to\n\nconstruct a community.\n\n     A security  might exist if the  defendants had promised,\n                      \n\nalong  with   the  land  sales,  to   develop  the  community\n\nthemselves.   Then each buyer might be  acquiring an interest\n\nnot only in land but in  a package of commitments that, taken\n\ntogether, could comprise  a business  venture harnessing  the\n\nentrepreneurship of the  promoter.  Each parcel of land would\n\nstill  have a different  value, unlike  the typical  share of\n\nstock, but most  of the  potential gain might  depend on  the\n\ndevelopment of the  community as  a whole.   Cf. Joiner,  320\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at 348-49  (promised oil well gave mineral  leases \"most\n\nof  their  value and  all of  their  lure\").   The promoter's\n\ncommitment to build the  community, in turn, could constitute\n\nthe  \"common  enterprise\"  financed  jointly  by the  buyers.\n\nHowey,  328 U.S. at 299.   Several decisions  have taken this\n     \n\nview, and we  think they may be correct in  principle.  E.g.,\n                                                           \n\n                             -11-\n\nMcCown v. Heidler, 527  F.2d 204 (10th Cir. 1975);  Miller v.\n                                                          \n\nWoodmoor,  CCH Fed. Secur. L. Rep.   96,109, 91,998-999 (D.C.\n        \n\nColo. 1976); Aldrich, 627 F.2d at 1038-1040.\n                    \n\n     In this case, however, the most that can be said is that\n\nthe  promoter   left  the  distinct,  and  distinctly  false,\n\nimpression  that a  community  was going  to develop  through\n\nnatural forces.   Many buyers were  told that Disney  World's\n\npresence  nearby  would  spur  growth.    Others  were  shown\n\npictures  of specific sports  facilities already  existing at\n\nspecific  distances.   But  aside from  the lodge  or country\n\nclub, there was little  testimony that specific promises were\n\nmade  by anyone to do specific things.5  Accordingly, what we\n\nhave is  sales of property based on  false representations as\n\nto  its  prospects, but  there is  no  pretence of  a \"common\n\nenterprise\" managed by the  promoter and hence no \"security.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Woodward  v. Terracor, 574  F.2d 1023, 1025  (10th\n                                \n\nCir. 1978);  Happy Investment Group  v. Lakewood  Properties,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 396 F. Supp. 175, 180-81 (N.D. Cal. 1975).\n   \n\n     One  might  ask why  the  absence of  a  security should\n\nmatter.  The  property was made attractive by  the promoter's\n\n                    \n\n     5The promoter  proposed to  convey an existing  house to\nthe community for  use as  a lodge by  buyers visiting  their\nland and offered  memberships in a to-be-constructed  country\nclub.   The  latter offer  was accepted  by none  of the  152\nbuyers  who  are  plaintiffs in  this  case.    In any  case,\nscattered  references to  these limited  amenities would  not\ntransform the purchase of a lot into a share in a development\nventure.  See Rice, 922 F.2d at 790-91.\n                  \n\n                             -12-\n\nclaims that a  community would arise,  and those claims  were\n\nblatantly false, or so a jury could  find.  But this is not a\n\nsimple \"fraud\"  case:   the buyers, seemingly  through delay,\n\nhave apparently  lost their fraud remedies,  except for their\n\nRICO  claim based  on supposed  predicate acts  of securities\n\nfraud.   Without securities, this RICO  claim evaporates.  It\n\nis disagreeable for  a court  to turn away  victims who  have\n\nbeen wronged.   But  we cannot disregard  controlling Supreme\n\nCourt  decisions or  distort  the securities  laws to  rescue\n\nplaintiffs who have themselves cast their legitimate remedies\n\naway.\n\n     Puerto Rico  law provides  ample remedies for  defrauded\n\nbuyers of land.  See 31 L.P.R.A.   3408-3409.  The Interstate\n                    \n\nLand  Sales Full Disclosure Act,  15 U.S.C.     1701 et seq.,\n                                                           \n\noffers  a broad gauged federal remedy, modeled in part on the\n\nSecurities Act of 1933.  Indeed, RICO itself makes mail fraud\n\na  predicate act, 18 U.S.C.   1961(1)(A), but the buyers here\n\ndelayed  too  long in  asserting this  claim.   All  of these\n\npossible claims, federal and  local, could have been asserted\n\nin a timely filed complaint in this case.   Sometimes the law\n\nitself is at fault; this time the fault is with the lawyers.\n\n                       III.  MISCELLANY\n\n     Ignoring their own defaults, the buyers' lawyers instead\n\nassail  the district  judge.   They  devote the  first thirty\n\npages of argument in  their brief (no reply brief  was filed)\n\n                             -13-\n\nnot to the difficult legal issues of RICO and securities law,\n\nbut  to  claims  that   the  district  judge  barred  leading\n\nquestions, helped certain defendants with their answers,  and\n\notherwise misconducted the trial.  \n\n     There is some reason to believe that the district judge,\n\nfar  from tilting against the buyers,  took steps to preserve\n\nwhat  claims he could for the buyers.   One effort he made to\n\nexpedite the case through certified  questions was frustrated\n\nin  part by the buyers' neglect to follow a simple procedural\n\nrule. See Rodriguez v. Banco Central, 917 F.2d at 668-69.  He\n                                    \n\nalso  permitted the buyers to  go to trial  on their marginal\n\nRICO  security  claim,  allowing  them  to  flesh  out  their\n\n\"securities\"   allegation   through   evidence    of   actual\n\nrepresentations; many  other judges, we are  confident, would\n\nhave dismissed the securities claims before trial in light of\n\nthe Supreme Court decisions already discussed.\n\n     In all events, the instances  offered to show error  and\n\npartiality  by the district judge in his conduct of the trial\n\nare close to  trivial.   Trial judges  are constantly  making\n\njudgments about  the use  of leading questions,  the need  to\n\nclarify  witness  answers,  and   similar  matters  of  trial\n\nmanagement.  In  this realm the  widest possible latitude  is\n\ngiven to the judge on the  scene.  Borges v. Our Lady  of the\n                                                             \n\nSea Corp.,  935 F.2d  436,  442 (1st  Cir.  1991).   We  have\n        \n\nexamined  the many examples and transcript citations provided\n\n                             -14-\n\nin the buyers' brief.  Almost all are routine  \"calls\" by the\n\ndistrict judge, who  must make hundreds of snap  judgments in\n\nthe course of a long trial, and are well within the bounds of\n\npropriety.\n\n     The  only legal  point worth  mentioning is  the buyers'\n\ncomplaint  that the  trial judge  limited or  forbade leading\n\nquestions when the buyers as part of their direct case called\n\ncertain  defendants as witnesses.   The buyers  urge that the\n\njudge erred  by refusing  to declare the  witnesses \"hostile\"\n\nand to allow the use of leading questions on direct.  On this\n\npoint they  themselves  err.   A  \"hostile\" witness,  in  the\n\njargon of evidence law, is not an adverse party but a witness\n\nwho  shows  himself  or   herself  so  adverse  to  answering\n\nquestions,  whatever  the  source  of  the  antagonism,  that\n\nleading questions  may be used  to press the  questions home.\n\nSee  United States v. Brown, 603 F.2d 1022, 1025-26 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1979).\n\n     The buyers  are on stronger  ground in arguing  that the\n\nrules generally  permit leading questions to  be used against\n\nan opposing  party.   Fed.  R.  Evid. 611(c).   This  is  not\n\nbecause  that party  is a  hostile witness  in the  technical\n\nsense  but because,  however cooperative,  the witness  has a\n\nbuilt-in incentive to  slide away from the  question or slant\n\nthe  answer.   But  Rule 611(c)  is  arguably subject  to the\n\noverriding  command  of Rule  611(a)  that  the court  \"shall\n\n                             -15-\n\nexercise  reasonable  control  over   the  mode  .  .   .  of\n\ninterrogating witnesses\"  to  elicit truth,  avoid delay  and\n\nprotect against harassment.  Fed. R. Evid. 611(a).  We cannot\n\nbelieve,  for  example,  that   a  district  judge  would  be\n\ncompelled  to allow  leading  questions to  an adverse  party\n\nwhere  the judge  found  that this  mode  was distorting  the\n\ntestimony of a suggestible adverse-party witness.\n\n     In all events we need not decide whether the trial judge\n\nin this case misread Rule 611(c) or precisely when and how it\n\nmay be overridden.  There can be no reversal on such a ground\n\nwithout  a showing of prejudice, Fed. R. Evid. 103(a), and no\n\nshowing of prejudice without a proffer, ordinarily one in the\n\nrecord.   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2).   In this case there is no\n\nshowing  of any  specific  information that  might have  been\n\nelicited, pertinent to  the dispositive securities issue,  if\n\nthe buyers' counsel  had been permitted to ask the defendants\n\nleading  questions.  Without  some notion of  where a leading\n\nquestion  might have led, any  error (if error  there was) is\n\nharmless.  See Ellis  v. City of Chicago,  667 F.2d 606,  613\n                                        \n\n(7th Cir. 1981).\n\n     The buyers' final  claim is that the  trial judge abused\n\nhis  discretion in  refusing  the buyers'  requests to  amend\n\ntheir  complaint.   The  amendments would  have alleged  mail\n\nfraud as predicate acts under RICO and stated  separate fraud\n\nor  like  claims  under Puerto  Rican  law.    Each of  these\n\n                             -16-\n\nattempted   amendments  has  a  somewhat  different  history.\n\nNeither history  bears out  the charge that  the trial  judge\n\nerred.\n\n     The original complaint in this case was filed on  August\n\n2, 1982.  No  RICO count asserting mail fraud  was included.6\n\nOn  May 1, 1985, the magistrate ordered that the buyers \"will\n\nmove to amend the complaint\"; for almost two years it appears\n\nthat  no amendments  were  proposed.7   Then amendments  were\n\nproposed  by the buyers  on April 10,  1987, and  on June 10,\n\n1988,  but  no  mail fraud  predicate  acts  under RICO  were\n\nasserted  in either  instance.   On  December 18,  1989, over\n\nseven years after the  start of the case and  after extensive\n\ndiscovery, the buyers for  the first time sought to  add mail\n\nfraud under RICO to the case.\n\n     As  for fraud claims under Puerto  Rican law, no mention\n\nwas  made of such claims in the original complaint.  Contrary\n\nto  the  buyers'  brief  in  this  court, the  first  amended\n\ncomplaint,  filed in  1987, did  not assert such  claims; all\n\nthat appears is a brief reference  to unidentified violations\n\n                    \n\n     6The  buyers' brief says  that \"averments concerning the\nfraudulent  use  of   the  U.S.  mails  were  made\"  in  this\ncomplaint.   In fact, the complaint  refers to the use of the\nmails  in the  securities  fraud  claim, interstate  commerce\nbeing an element of  securities fraud, but no charge  of mail\nfraud appears.\n\n     7The  buyers'  brief asserts,  without  record citation,\nthat the  magistrate asked them  to delay moving  until after\nthe class  certification was settled.   The defendants' brief\nsays this is untrue.\n\n                             -17-\n\nof \"the Civil  Code of Puerto  Rico and Law  145 of June  18,\n\n1980,\"  in  the  \"jurisdiction  and  venue\"  portion  of  the\n\ncomplaint.   The Puerto Rican  law claims were  first made in\n\nthe   second  amended  complaint  submitted  June  10,  1988,\n\npurportedly tendered  pursuant to a court  order permitting a\n\nnew  caption  to identify  plaintiffs.    The district  court\n\nunderstandably  rejected  this  attempt  to  smuggle  in  new\n\nallegations, and the Puerto Rican  claims were not raised  in\n\nthe third motion to amend filed December 18, 1989.\n\n     This corrected version of events speaks  for itself.  No\n\nreason is offered  in the  buyers' brief why  mail fraud  and\n\nlocal-law   claims,   which    should   have   been   evident\n\npossibilities  in 1982,  were not  asserted straightforwardly\n\nand in  timely fashion.  The  further along a case  is toward\n\ntrial, the greater the threat of prejudice and delay when new\n\nclaims are belatedly added.  The district court did not abuse\n\nits  considerable  discretion in  denying  leave  to add  new\n\nclaims years  after the case began, after much discovery, and\n\nwithout any adequate  excuse for  the delay.   See  generally\n                                                             \n\nTiernan v.

BACKGROUND\n\n     The underlying facts, viewing  the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to  the buyers,  can be briefly  stated.   The\n\nbuyers, most of whom  are residents of Puerto Rico,  acquired\n\ntheir lots in  Florida beginning  in the  early 1970's  after\n\nbeing  approached   by  the   real  estate   company's  sales\n\nrepresentatives.    During  these meetings,  the  prospective\n\n                    \n\n     1RICO  is   the  Racketeering  Influenced   and  Corrupt\nOrganizations chapter  of the Organized Crime  Control Act of\n1970, 18 U.S.C.    1961-68.  The real estate company was J.C.\nInvestments,  Inc.    The  original financing  was  by  Banco\nEconomias  and a group of investors.  Banco Central succeeded\nBanco Economias.  \n\n                             -2-\n\nbuyers were offered  the opportunity  to purchase  subdivided\n\nlots  in an undeveloped site that would eventually, they were\n\ntold, include roads, schools, churches, stores and  elaborate\n\nrecreational  facilities.    The  project was  touted  as  an\n\nexcellent investment due not only to prospective development,\n\nbut also to its close proximity to  Disney World.  These oral\n\nassurances  were bolstered by promotional brochures depicting\n\nsporting activities at nearby locations  and other literature\n\ninforming buyers of the development's progress.\n\n     A cautionary statement, written in small print in one of\n\nthe promotional brochures,  advised that the  development was\n\n\"not  a homesite  offering.\"   Another  pamphlet warned  that\n\n\"[i]mprovements such as roads  and drainage are not presently\n\non  the property  and  are not  contemplated.\"   Yet  another\n\nwarning,  this one  prominently  featured in  a Florida  Land\n\nSales  Board Offering  Statement and  included as  well  in a\n\nbrochure, advised buyers that the property was not usable for\n\nbuilding purposes,  that  the  seller  neither  promised  nor\n\ncontemplated any improvements, and  that 35% of the  land was\n\n\"marshy or swampy\" and subject to flooding.\n\n     Most buyers  did not read  these warnings and  those who\n\ndid  were   often  told  that  the   warnings  were  standard\n\nboilerplate  required for  all Florida  land sales.   Another\n\nresponse was that the  swampy sites would be drained  and the\n\nwater  diverted  to  form  ponds  and  lakes.    The  buyers,\n\n                             -3-\n\naccording to  their testimony,  were assured that  their land\n\ncould be  used as  a  home site  or  for any  other  purpose.\n\nSeveral  chose  their  lots  from a  map  which  divided  the\n\ndevelopment  into \"residential\"  and \"commercial\"  sections. \n\nThe vast majority  of buyers, many of whom hoped to retire to\n\nFlorida, purchased their lots  with the intention of building\n\na  home.   According  to their  testimony,  only a  few  were\n\nconcerned solely with the re-sale value of their property and\n\nhad  no  intention  of residing  on  or  developing  the lots\n\nthemselves.\n\n     The projected  improvements were  not made.   The buyers\n\neventually learned, some through a local newspaper, that they\n\nwere  the  owners  of swamp  land  worth  a  fraction of  the\n\npurchase price.   At trial,  the buyers produced  experts who\n\ntestified that, as a result of zoning restrictions applicable\n\nto  flood-prone  areas, few  of the  lots  could be  built on\n\nlegally.     The   experts   said  that,   even  absent   the\n\nrestrictions,  the  area was  physically  unsuitable for  any\n\nbroad-scale development.\n\n     On  August  2, 1982,  the  buyers  brought  suit in  the\n\ndistrict  court,  making  claims   against  the  real  estate\n\ncompany,  the financing  bank, and  a number  of individuals.\n\nThe complaint asserted claims under the Interstate Land Sales\n\nFull  Disclosure  Act,  15  U.S.C.      1701  et   seq.,  the\n                                                      \n\nSecurities Exchange  Act, section 10(b), 15  U.S.C.   78j(b),\n\n                             -4-\n\nand RICO, 18  U.S.C.   1962(a)  (use of racketeering  derived\n\nincome).   Much time was consumed with class action disputes,\n\ndiscovery,  statute   of  limitations  issues,   and  various\n\nattempts to  amend the  complaint.  Eventually,  the district\n\ncourt in November 1989 dismissed all these claims but allowed\n\nthe buyers to amend in order to  allege a RICO claim charging\n\nsecurities  fraud as  predicate  acts.2   Rodriquez v.

At\n\nthe  same  time the  court declined  to  allow the  buyers to\n\nallege mail fraud under RICO.   The distinction, the district\n\ncourt explained, was that securities fraud had been  an issue\n\nin some form  from the  outset;3 mail fraud,  in the  court's\n\nview,  had  not  been  alleged  until  after seven  years  of\n\nlitigation, including extensive discovery.\n\n     Trial  commenced on  August  5, 1991,  and concluded  on\n\nSeptember  24, 1991.  The evidence submitted has already been\n\n                    \n\n     2The Land  Sales Act and Securities  Exchange Act claims\nwere dismissed on statute of  limitations grounds.  The  RICO\nclaim under    1962(a), charging use  of racketeering derived\nincome, was dismissed for lack of standing.\n\n     3In addition to the claim of  securities fraud under the\nSecurities  Act  of 1934,  the  original  complaint had  also\nmentioned securities  fraud as  part of the  improvident RICO\nclaim under 18 U.S.C.   1962(a).\n\n                             -5-\n\ndescribed briefly and  is discussed  further below.   At  the\n\nconclusion  of the evidence,  the court on  October 10, 1991,\n\ngranted a motion for judgment as  a matter of law and ordered\n\njudgment for all defendants,  Rodriguez v.

In  its  lengthy opinion,  the district  court held\n\ninter  alia that the land  sale contracts were not securities\n           \n\nunder  the  federal securities  laws.    In consequence,  the\n\nbuyers' RICO claim failed for lack of the necessary predicate\n\nacts.\n\n                     II. THE RICO CLAIMS\n\n     RICO  makes  it unlawful  for  a  person to  conduct  an\n\nenterprise  in or  affecting  interstate  commerce through  a\n\npattern  of \"racketeering  activity.\"   18 U.S.C.    1962(c).\n\n\"Racketeering activity\"  is defined to include  \"fraud in the\n\nsale of securities.\"   Id.    1961(1)(D).   For a  \"pattern,\"\n                         \n\nthere must  be  at least  two acts  of racketeering  activity\n\nwithin ten years of each other, id.   1961(5), here, fraud in\n                                  \n\nthe  sale of  securities.   In this  case, the  buyers  had a\n\nsufficient case of fraud to put before a  jury.  The question\n\nis whether it was fraud in the sale of \"securities.\"\n\n     The  district  court concluded  that no  reasonable jury\n\ncould  find  the  land sale  contracts  in  this  case to  be\n\n\"securities,\" a term that  the federal securities laws define\n\n                             -6-\n\nto include \"investment contracts.\"4   Rodriquez, 777 F.

Our analysis  on  appeal therefore  begins  by\n\nparsing  the terms  \"securities\" and  \"investment contracts,\"\n\ndistinguishing   them  from   other  forms  of   property  or\n\ncontractual arrangements.   This  legal furrow has  been well\n\nplowed  in  prior  opinions, but  imaginative  promoters  are\n\nconstantly devising new lures and promises to tempt investors\n\nand perplex the courts. \n\n     The  definition   of  \"investment  contract\"   has  been\n\nbracketed by a  set of Supreme  Court decisions which,  while\n\nthey  involve facts quite  different than ours,  mark out our\n\npath.

One   may  have  an  interest  in  an  enterprise--an\n\nemployment contract, for example--that is  not an entitlement\n\nto  profits or  increased  value.    Conversely,  in  a  sole\n\nproprietorship the owner could have a claim on all profits of\n\nthe enterprise  but there  might be no  contract or  security\n\ninvolved.    Further, the  Supreme  Court  cases mark  out  a\n\nconcept, not a precise definition.  The term \"securities,\" we\n       \n\nare   told,  must   be  flexibly   applied  to   capture  new\n\narrangements  comprising the  essence of  securities, however\n\nthey may  be named.   SEC v.

First, what the\n\ncontracts say  is not all  that the  buyers were told  by the\n\nsalespersons; the  evidence  reveals that  many  buyers  were\n\nshown materials and given oral assurances that went beyond or\n\neven contradicted  the formal legal documents.

A complication is\n\nnow introduced:  while the lots were offered as an investment\n\nby the seller, most  buyers intended to live on  the property\n\nand  purchased  primarily for  use.   A  purchase for  use or\n\nconsumption, it  is  said, is  not a  security or  investment\n\ncontract.  Forman, 421 U.S. at  852-53.  We need not sort out\n                 \n\nthe  problem of  opposing  buyer and  seller viewpoints,  nor\n\nsearch out buyers who had investment in mind, because another\n\naspect of the matter decides the case.\n\n     In our  view even if every buyer  bought for investment,\n\nwhat was purchased in this case was not a share of a business\n\nenterprise and so not  a security.  Taking the  evidence most\n\nfavorably to the  buyers, they were  sold land in  individual\n\n                             -10-\n\nparcels  with  strong  and  repeated   suggestions  that  the\n\nsurrounding  area would develop  into a  thriving residential\n\ncommunity.  But apart  from the promise of an  existing lodge\n\nor a new  country club, the  evidence did not  show that  the\n\npromoter  or  any  other   obligated  person  or  entity  was\n\npromising the buyers  to build  or provide anything.   A  few\n\nscraps of  evidence, usually  ambiguous, may point  the other\n\nway but we do not think that a reasonable jury could conclude\n\non  this  record  that   the  defendants  were  promising  to\n\nconstruct a community.\n\n     A security  might exist if the  defendants had promised,\n                      \n\nalong  with   the  land  sales,  to   develop  the  community\n\nthemselves.   Then each buyer might be  acquiring an interest\n\nnot only in land but in  a package of commitments that, taken\n\ntogether, could comprise  a business  venture harnessing  the\n\nentrepreneurship of the  promoter.  Each parcel of land would\n\nstill  have a different  value, unlike  the typical  share of\n\nstock, but most  of the  potential gain might  depend on  the\n\ndevelopment of the  community as  a whole.

The  property was made attractive by  the promoter's\n\n                    \n\n     5The promoter  proposed to  convey an existing  house to\nthe community for  use as  a lodge by  buyers visiting  their\nland and offered  memberships in a to-be-constructed  country\nclub.   The  latter offer  was accepted  by none  of the  152\nbuyers  who  are  plaintiffs in  this  case.    In any  case,\nscattered  references to  these limited  amenities would  not\ntransform the purchase of a lot into a share in a development\nventure.  See Rice, 922 F.2d at 790-91.\n                  \n\n                             -12-\n\nclaims that a  community would arise,  and those claims  were\n\nblatantly false, or so a jury could  find.  But this is not a\n\nsimple \"fraud\"  case:   the buyers, seemingly  through delay,\n\nhave apparently  lost their fraud remedies,  except for their\n\nRICO  claim based  on supposed  predicate acts  of securities\n\nfraud.   Without securities, this RICO  claim evaporates.  It\n\nis disagreeable for  a court  to turn away  victims who  have\n\nbeen wronged.   But  we cannot disregard  controlling Supreme\n\nCourt  decisions or  distort  the securities  laws to  rescue\n\nplaintiffs who have themselves cast their legitimate remedies\n\naway.\n\n     Puerto Rico  law provides  ample remedies for  defrauded\n\nbuyers of land.  See 31 L.P.R.A.   3408-3409.  The Interstate\n                    \n\nLand  Sales Full Disclosure Act,  15 U.S.C.     1701 et seq.,\n                                                           \n\noffers  a broad gauged federal remedy, modeled in part on the\n\nSecurities Act of 1933.  Indeed, RICO itself makes mail fraud\n\na  predicate act, 18 U.S.C.   1961(1)(A), but the buyers here\n\ndelayed  too  long in  asserting this  claim.   All  of these\n\npossible claims, federal and  local, could have been asserted\n\nin a timely filed complaint in this case.   Sometimes the law\n\nitself is at fault; this time the fault is with the lawyers.\n\n                       III.  MISCELLANY\n\n     Ignoring their own defaults, the buyers' lawyers instead\n\nassail  the district  judge.   They  devote the  first thirty\n\npages of argument in  their brief (no reply brief  was filed)\n\n                             -13-\n\nnot to the difficult legal issues of RICO and securities law,\n\nbut  to  claims  that   the  district  judge  barred  leading\n\nquestions, helped certain defendants with their answers,  and\n\notherwise misconducted the trial.  \n\n     There is some reason to believe that the district judge,\n\nfar  from tilting against the buyers,  took steps to preserve\n\nwhat  claims he could for the buyers.   One effort he made to\n\nexpedite the case through certified  questions was frustrated\n\nin  part by the buyers' neglect to follow a simple procedural\n\nrule. See Rodriguez v. Banco Central, 917 F.2d at 668-69.  He\n                                    \n\nalso  permitted the buyers to  go to trial  on their marginal\n\nRICO  security  claim,  allowing  them  to  flesh  out  their\n\n\"securities\"   allegation   through   evidence    of   actual\n\nrepresentations; many  other judges, we are  confident, would\n\nhave dismissed the securities claims before trial in light of\n\nthe Supreme Court decisions already discussed.\n\n     In all events, the instances  offered to show error  and\n\npartiality  by the district judge in his conduct of the trial\n\nare close to  trivial.   Trial judges  are constantly  making\n\njudgments about  the use  of leading questions,  the need  to\n\nclarify  witness  answers,  and   similar  matters  of  trial\n\nmanagement.  In  this realm the  widest possible latitude  is\n\ngiven to the judge on the  scene.  Borges v. Our Lady  of the\n                                                             \n\nSea Corp.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562615\"><a href=\"/opinion/562615/john-borges-v-our-lady-of-the-sea-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  442 (1st  Cir.  1991).   We  have\n        \n\nexamined  the many examples and transcript citations provided\n\n                             -14-\n\nin the buyers' brief.  Almost all are routine  \"calls\" by the\n\ndistrict judge, who  must make hundreds of snap  judgments in\n\nthe course of a long trial, and are well within the bounds of\n\npropriety.\n\n     The  only legal  point worth  mentioning is  the buyers'\n\ncomplaint  that the  trial judge  limited or  forbade leading\n\nquestions when the buyers as part of their direct case called\n\ncertain  defendants as witnesses.   The buyers  urge that the\n\njudge erred  by refusing  to declare the  witnesses \"hostile\"\n\nand to allow the use of leading questions on direct.  On this\n\npoint they  themselves  err.   A  \"hostile\" witness,  in  the\n\njargon of evidence law, is not an adverse party but a witness\n\nwho  shows  himself  or   herself  so  adverse  to  answering\n\nquestions,  whatever  the  source  of  the  antagonism,  that\n\nleading questions  may be used  to press the  questions home.\n\nSee  United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368998\"><a href=\"/opinion/368998/united-states-v-john-t-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1025-26 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1979).\n\n     The buyers  are on stronger  ground in arguing  that the\n\nrules generally  permit leading questions to  be used against\n\nan opposing  party.   Fed.  R.  Evid. 611(c).   This  is  not\n\nbecause  that party  is a  hostile witness  in the  technical\n\nsense  but because,  however cooperative,  the witness  has a\n\nbuilt-in incentive to  slide away from the  question or slant\n\nthe  answer.   But  Rule 611(c)  is  arguably subject  to the\n\noverriding  command  of Rule  611(a)  that  the court  \"shall\n\n                             -15-\n\nexercise  reasonable  control  over   the  mode  .  .   .  of\n\ninterrogating witnesses\"  to  elicit truth,  avoid delay  and\n\nprotect against harassment.  Fed. R. Evid. 611(a).  We cannot\n\nbelieve,  for  example,  that   a  district  judge  would  be\n\ncompelled  to allow  leading  questions to  an adverse  party\n\nwhere  the judge  found  that this  mode  was distorting  the\n\ntestimony of a suggestible adverse-party witness.\n\n     In all events we need not decide whether the trial judge\n\nin this case misread Rule 611(c) or precisely when and how it\n\nmay be overridden.  There can be no reversal on such a ground\n\nwithout  a showing of prejudice, Fed. R. Evid. 103(a), and no\n\nshowing of prejudice without a proffer, ordinarily one in the\n\nrecord.   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2).   In this case there is no\n\nshowing  of any  specific  information that  might have  been\n\nelicited, pertinent to  the dispositive securities issue,  if\n\nthe buyers' counsel  had been permitted to ask the defendants\n\nleading  questions.  Without  some notion of  where a leading\n\nquestion  might have led, any  error (if error  there was) is\n\nharmless.  See Ellis  v. City of Chicago,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398271\"><a href=\"/opinion/398271/john-clinton-ellis-barbara-ellis-and-frederick-ellis-v-city-of-chicago-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  613\n                                        \n\n(7th Cir. 1981).\n\n     The buyers' final  claim is that the  trial judge abused\n\nhis  discretion in  refusing  the buyers'  requests to  amend\n\ntheir  complaint.   The  amendments would  have alleged  mail\n\nfraud as predicate acts under RICO and stated  separate fraud\n\nor  like  claims  under Puerto  Rican  law.    Each of  these\n\n                             -16-\n\nattempted   amendments  has  a  somewhat  different  history.\n\nNeither history  bears out  the charge that  the trial  judge\n\nerred.\n\n     The original complaint in this case was filed on  August\n\n2, 1982.  No  RICO count asserting mail fraud  was included.6\n\nOn  May 1, 1985, the magistrate ordered that the buyers \"will\n\nmove to amend the complaint\"; for almost two years it appears\n\nthat  no amendments  were  proposed.7   Then amendments  were\n\nproposed  by the buyers  on April 10,  1987, and  on June 10,\n\n1988,  but  no  mail fraud  predicate  acts  under RICO  were\n\nasserted  in either  instance.   On  December 18,  1989, over\n\nseven years after the  start of the case and  after extensive\n\ndiscovery, the buyers for  the first time sought to  add mail\n\nfraud under RICO to the case.\n\n     As  for fraud claims under Puerto  Rican law, no mention\n\nwas  made of such claims in the original complaint.  Contrary\n\nto  the  buyers'  brief  in  this  court, the  first  amended\n\ncomplaint,  filed in  1987, did  not assert such  claims; all\n\nthat appears is a brief reference  to unidentified violations\n\n                    \n\n     6The  buyers' brief says  that \"averments concerning the\nfraudulent  use  of   the  U.S.  mails  were  made\"  in  this\ncomplaint.   In fact, the complaint  refers to the use of the\nmails  in the  securities  fraud  claim, interstate  commerce\nbeing an element of  securities fraud, but no charge  of mail\nfraud appears.\n\n     7The  buyers'  brief asserts,  without  record citation,\nthat the  magistrate asked them  to delay moving  until after\nthe class  certification was settled.   The defendants' brief\nsays this is untrue.\n\n                             -17-\n\nof \"the Civil  Code of Puerto  Rico and Law  145 of June  18,\n\n1980,\"  in  the  \"jurisdiction  and  venue\"  portion  of  the\n\ncomplaint.   The Puerto Rican  law claims were  first made in\n\nthe   second  amended  complaint  submitted  June  10,  1988,\n\npurportedly tendered  pursuant to a court  order permitting a\n\nnew  caption  to identify  plaintiffs.    The district  court\n\nunderstandably  rejected  this  attempt  to  smuggle  in  new\n\nallegations, and the Puerto Rican  claims were not raised  in\n\nthe third motion to amend filed December 18, 1989.\n\n     This corrected version of events speaks  for itself.  No\n\nreason is offered  in the  buyers' brief why  mail fraud  and\n\nlocal-law   claims,   which    should   have   been   evident\n\npossibilities  in 1982,  were not  asserted straightforwardly\n\nand in  timely fashion.  The  further along a case  is toward\n\ntrial, the greater the threat of prejudice and delay when new\n\nclaims are belatedly added.  The district court did not abuse\n\nits  considerable  discretion in  denying  leave  to add  new\n\nclaims years  after the case began, after much discovery, and\n\nwithout any adequate  excuse for  the delay.
