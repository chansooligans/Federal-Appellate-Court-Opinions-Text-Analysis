The   district  court  disposed  of  the\n                \n\ncomplaint  of  plaintiff/appellant,  Thomas  Budnick,  by the\n\nfollowing order:\n\n               This  Court has  thoroughly reviewed\n          the  plaintiff's Complaint.   It  is rife\n          with    bizarre    factual   and    legal\n          allegations   rendering   it    virtually\n          incomprehensible.      This   Court   has\n          concluded that  the plaintiff's Complaint\n          fails to state a  claim upon which relief\n          can be  granted.  Therefore,  this Court,\n          acting sua sponte, ORDERS that the above-\n                           \n          entitled   action   be   DISMISSED   WITH\n          PREJUDICE.\n               SO ORDERED.\n\nBudnick appeals the dismissal of his complaint with prejudice\n\nand the denial  of his subsequent  motions seeking to  vacate\n\nthe  dismissal, to vacate  the \"with  prejudice\" designation,\n\nand  to  amend his  complaint.   While  we disagree  with the\n\ndistrict  court's  characterization   of  the  complaint   as\n\nvirtually incomprehensible,1 we agree  that it fails to state\n\n                    \n\n1.  To be sure, Budnick's complaint contains references which\nunderstandably may be characterized as bizarre.  Budnick is a\nself-proclaimed  space  prospector,  who  believes  that  the\nUnited  States ought  to continue  its \"manifest  destiny\" by\nclaiming  mineral  rights  on  heavenly bodies,  on  its  own\nbehalf, rather than allowing  space exploration to be pursued\non  behalf of \"common mankind.\"   Using various resources, he\nhas mapped  out mining  claims to plots  on several  planets,\nasteroids, and  the  moon,  which he  believes  are  rich  in\ndiamonds,  gold, platinum,  and other  strategic metals.   He\nsought to file his mining claims in numerous county courts of\nnumerous states, but was rebuffed.  Since 1981, however,  the\nSabine County  Court, in rural  East Texas, has  accepted for\nfiling more than  60 of his mining  claims because, according\nto the court clerk's office, the county needed the money from\nthe filing fees.   Budnick says  that he does  not expect  to\ngain any financial  remuneration; he has filed his  claims in\nthe  names of the heirs of, among others, Sam Houston, Moses,\n\n                             -2-\n\na  claim upon  which  relief can  be  granted.   Further,  we\n\nconclude that any amendment would be futile.  With respect to\n\nthe pendent state  law claims, however, we  believe that they\n\nshould  have been  dismissed  without prejudice  for lack  of\n\n                    \n\nand Martin Luther.\n     Fragmentary references to this hobby (and to field assay\nwork  which  he  has  done  here  on  Earth)  were  scattered\nthroughout  his  complaint.    A somewhat  clearer  frame  of\nreference  emerged  when  Budnick  filed  his  opposition  to\nAttorney Loesch's  motion to dismiss, see  footnote 4, infra,\n                                                            \nand he  submitted copies of several  newspaper accounts which\noutlined this story.\n     Although these factual allegations are odd, they suggest\nthat  Budnick  may  be  eccentric,  but  do  not  support  an\ninference that  he is delusional.   And, while  these factual\nallegations  arguably may  seem  bizarre, they  were not  the\nbasis  for any bizarre legal  allegations.  The complaint, as\ndescribed infra  at 7-8, alleged that  Budnick was unlawfully\n               \narrested  for attempting to cut  down a tree  on his parents'\nproperty  and then held  involuntarily for mental evaluation.\nAt  first blush, it is  puzzling why these  references to his\nhobby  were included  at  all.   A  closer reading  suggests,\nhowever,  that Budnick  proceeded on  the assumption  that he\nmust  present  his entire  case  when  filing his  complaint,\nincluding resulting harm.   And, in his view,  his reputation\nhas  been damaged  by his  confinement for  mental evaluation\nfollowing  his arrest.   Budnick  concedes that  he has  been\nscoffed at  by  many, but,  he  says, people  dismissed  this\ncountry's purchases  of the Louisiana  Territory and  Alaska.\nHis credibility can only  be further weakened, he says,  when\nthose  who  disagree  with   his  support  for  a  continuing\n\"manifest  destiny\" discover  his involuntary  commitment for\npsychiatric  evaluation.   Damage  to  reputation  alone,  of\ncourse,  does not  constitute a  viable  claim under    1983.\nPaul v. Davis, 424  U.S. 693, 713 (1976); Watterson  v. Page,\n                                                            \nNo.  92-1224, 1993  WL  23908, at  *6 n.4  (1st Cir.  Feb. 9,\n1993).  But Budnick  did not allege damage to  his reputation\nas  the basis  for his cause  of action.   He  asked that the\ncourt consider that harm  in assessing damages resulting from\nwhat  he  alleged  was  an unlawful  arrest  and  involuntary\ncommitment for mental evaluation.\n     Construing this  inartful pro se complaint  in a liberal\nfashion,  as we  must, Haines  v. Kerner,  404 U.S.  519, 520\n                                        \n(1972), we disagree that it is \"virtually incomprehensible.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\njurisdiction.  We vacate and remand to the district court for\n\nentry of a judgment reflecting that conclusion.  In all other\n\nrespects, we affirm the district court's order.\n\n                   I.  The Legal Standards\n\n     The district  court did not  spell out the  statutory or\n\nother  available basis  for  its sua  sponte dismissal.   The\n\norder's language - \"the  plaintiff's Complaint fails to state\n\na  claim upon  which relief  can be  granted\" -  suggests the\n\ndismissal  was  pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 12(b)(6).   We\n\nproceed, therefore, on that basis.2\n\n     The standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is a familiar\n\nand oft-repeated one.  \"[A] complaint should not be dismissed\n\nfor failure to state  a claim unless it appears  beyond doubt\n\nthat the  plaintiff can prove no  set of facts in  support of\n\nhis  claim which  would entitle  him to  relief.\"   Conley v.\n                                                          \n\nGibson,  355 U.S.  41,  45-46  (1957).    We  review  such  a\n      \n\ndismissal de novo.   Kale v.  Combined Ins.  Co. of Am.,  924\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  1161,  1165 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied,  112 S.  Ct. 69\n                                            \n\n(1991); Gonzalez-Bernal  v. United States, 907  F.2d 246, 248\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     The  Supreme Court, as yet, has had \"no occasion to pass\n\njudgment, however,  on the permissible scope, if  any, of sua\n\n                    \n\n2.  In any event, we rule out as a possible basis 28 U.S.C.  \n1915(d), as  that statute applies  only to in  forma pauperis\nactions, Street v. Fair,  918 F.2d 269, 272 (1st  Cir. 1990),\n                       \nwhich this was not.  Budnick paid the required filing fee.  \n\n                             -4-\n\nsponte dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6).\"  Neitzke v.

The Court has pointed out that\n\n\"[u]nder Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff with an arguable claim is\n\nordinarily accorded notice of a pending motion to dismiss for\n\nfailure  to state  a claim  and an  opportunity to  amend the\n\ncomplaint before the  motion is ruled upon.\"  Id.  at 329.  A\n                                                 \n\nsua sponte dismissal preempts  that notice and opportunity to\n\namend before dismissal.\n\n     We  have  suggested,  in   dictum,  that  a  sua  sponte\n\ndismissal  on  the ground  that  a  complaint is  inadequate,\n\nwithout notice  of the proposed dismissal  and an opportunity\n\nto address  the issue,  might require reversal.

Quinn, 482 F.2d 372, 374  (1st Cir. 1973).3  Even if\n              \n\nthe district court  erred in failing to  provide Budnick with\n\npre-dismissal notice and opportunity to respond in this case,\n\nhowever,  we decline to remand because it is evident that (1)\n\nBudnick could not prevail  based on the facts alleged  in the\n\ncomplaint, see Smith v.  Boyd, 945 F.2d 1041, 1043  (8th Cir.\n                             \n\n                    \n\n3.  Some courts  have reversed  in such circumstances.

Although the order of  dismissal stated that the district\ncourt was acting sua sponte, one  of the defendants, Attorney\nSteven Loesch,  had filed a  motion to  dismiss, pursuant  to\nRule  12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim, and Budnick had\nfiled an opposition.  The grounds raised in Attorney Loesch's\nmotion, however, would not  have provided Budnick with notice\nof any potential defects  in his complaint as  to any of  the\nother  eight  defendants,  excepting  perhaps  the  defendant\nBarnstable County Bar Advocates,  Inc., which Budnick alleged\nwas  Loesch's  employer.    We  treat  the  district  court's\ndismissal, therefore, as it,  itself, characterized it - that\nis, as a  sua sponte dismissal.   Our conclusion --  that the\nfailure to  provide  Budnick with  pre-dismissal  notice  and\nopportunity to  respond does not warrant  reversal because it\nis evident that  his complaint  failed to state  a claim  and\nthat no amendment could  remedy it -- necessarily encompasses\na conclusion that there was no error in dismissing  Budnick's\nclaim  against Loesch,  the deficiency  of which  Budnick, in\nfact,  had  notice and  to which  he  had the  opportunity to\nrespond.\n     We  are also aware that the sua sponte dismissal in this\ncase deprived Budnick  of his  right, under Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\n15(a), to amend  his complaint \"once as a matter of course at\n\n                             -6-\n\n                      II.  The Complaint\n\n     Budnick's  complaint  is  written  in  a narrative,  and\n\nsomewhat  dramatic, form.   It  contains much  extraneous and\n\ndisjointed  information.     But  construing  this   inartful\n\npleading by  a pro  se litigant in  a liberal fashion,  as we\n\nmust,  Haines  v.  Kerner,  404  U.S.  519,  520 (1972),  and\n                         \n\naccepting  as  true the  factual  allegations  pled, Rodi  v.\n                                                         \n\nVentetuolo, 941 F.2d 22,  23 (1st Cir. 1991), we  can distill\n          \n\nfrom the  complaint that Budnick's  claims stem from  what he\n\nalleges was an  unlawful arrest.   The complaint alleges  the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     On September  23, 1990, Budnick resided  at his parents'\n\nhome  on Division  Street  in Harwich,  Massachusetts.   That\n\nhouse apparently is  in very close proximity  to the boundary\n\nbetween Harwich, and Dennis, Massachusetts.   Budnick alleges\n\nthat,  on that date, he began to  cut down a pine tree on the\n\nproperty,  which had been damaged  in a storm.   After making\n\ntwo  cuts in the tree,  his mother called  the Harwich Police\n\nDepartment.  Officer Jonathan Mitchell responded.\n\n     Budnick left the  scene, putting away his chain  saw and\n\ntaking his  car out for a  ride, he says, to get  the oil hot\n\n                    \n\nany  time before a responsive  pleading is served.\"   Fed. R.\nCiv.  P. 15(a);  Correa-Martinez  v. Arrillaga-Belendez,  903\n                                                       \nF.2d 49,  59 n.8 (1st Cir.  1990) (a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion to\ndismiss is not  a responsive  pleading for  purposes of  Rule\n15(a)).  Inasmuch as we have determined that  amendment would\nbe  futile, error, if it  be such, would  not warrant remand.\nCorrea-Martinez v.

He was,  at that time, he  alleges, 35 feet\n\ninto  Dennis.   A  Dennis police  officer arrived,  following\n\nwhich Harwich Police Officer Barry Mitchell arrived.  Officer\n\nBarry Mitchell  spent a very  short time in  Budnick's house,\n\nlooking at  what Budnick says  was a leaking  washing machine\n\npipe.   Budnick had purchased  a new washing  machine the day\n\nbefore and was  going to  replace the old  machine.   Officer\n\nBarry  Mitchell  then  came  out  and  arrested  Budnick  for\n\nmalicious destruction  of property over  $250 [apparently the\n\ntree and perhaps the pipe], Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266,   127, and\n\ndisorderly conduct, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272,   53.  Budnick, at\n\nthe time, was standing in Dennis.  Budnick's mother protested\n\nthat she had only wanted the officer to talk to her son.\n\n     Budnick spent  the night at the  Harwich police station.\n\nThe next day, he was taken to court, where he was examined by\n\nDr. Sidney  Callis, a court-appointed  psychiatrist.  Budnick\n\nclaims that Dr.  Callis deliberately misinterpreted Budnick's\n\nstatements  to   him.     The  court  committed   Budnick  to\n\nBridgewater  State Hospital  for psychological  testing.   On\n\nOctober  1, 1990, Budnick was transferred to Cape Cod and the\n\nIslands Community Mental Health Center.\n\n     On  October 12, 1990, Budnick returned to court.  He was\n\nrepresented  by  court-appointed  counsel,   Attorney  Steven\n\nLoesch.    Trial was  set  for  November  6,  1990.   In  the\n\n                             -8-\n\nmeantime,  according to  Budnick,  Loesch made  no effort  to\n\nconduct discovery.\n\n     On November  6th, the malicious  destruction of property\n\ncharges were  dismissed.   The disorderly conduct  charge was\n\ncontinued  without  a finding  for  30  days, whereupon  that\n\ncharge also was dismissed.\n\n     Budnick filed a twenty-one  page, eleven count complaint\n\nseeking  damages against nine  defendants -  (1) the  Town of\n\nHarwich, (2) the Harwich Police Department, (3) the estate of\n\nNorman Fennell, the former  Harwich Police Chief, (4) Officer\n\nJonathan  Mitchell,  (5)  Officer  Barry  Mitchell,  (6)  the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public  Safety, alleged to be the\n\nemployer of Dr.  Callis, (7) Dr.  Callis, (8) the  Barnstable\n\nCounty Bar  Advocates, Inc.,  alleged to  be the  employer of\n\nAttorney  Loesch, and  (9)  Attorney Loesch.   The  complaint\n\nalleged   claims   of  false   arrest,   false  imprisonment,\n\nconspiracy,  intentional  infliction  of emotional  distress,\n\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of  process, and negligence.  It\n\nalleged various bases for jurisdiction, including 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983 and  the Racketeer Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations\n\n(RICO)  statute,  18  U.S.C.    1961  et  seq.,  and  pendent\n\njurisdiction over the state tort claims.\n\n                       III.  Discussion\n\n     Because  all  of  Budnick's  claims stem  from  what  he\n\nalleges was  an unlawful warrantless arrest,  we begin there.\n\n                             -9-\n\nTo state  a cause of  action under 42 U.S.C.    1983, Budnick\n\nmust  show that, in arresting him, Officer Barry Mitchell (1)\n\nacted under color of state law; and (2) deprived Budnick of a\n\nright secured by the Constitution or federal law.  Parratt v.\n                                                          \n\nTaylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981).   There is no dispute  that\n      \n\nOfficer  Mitchell was  acting  under color  of  state law  in\n\narresting  Budnick.  Pittsley v.  Warish, 927 F.2d  3, 6 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 226 (1991).  As to the second\n                   \n\nelement  of a  cause  of action  under    1983,  the  federal\n\nConstitution permits an officer to arrest a suspect without a\n\nwarrant  if  there is  probable  cause  to  believe that  the\n\nsuspect has committed or is  committing an offense.  Michigan\n                                                             \n\nv. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 36 (1979).\n             \n\n     Budnick says  that his mother called  the Harwich police\n\nafter he started to cut down a tree on his parents' property.\n\nOfficer Jonathan  Mitchell  responded and  Budnick  left  the\n\nscene.   When  he returned,  Officer Barry  Mitchell arrived,\n\nentered Budnick's  parents' home for  a brief time,  where he\n\napparently spoke to Budnick's mother, exited and arrested him\n\nfor malicious destruction of property and disorderly conduct.\n\nThese facts  show that,  at the  moment of  Budnick's arrest,\n\n\"the   facts  and   circumstances   within   [Officer   Barry\n\nMitchell's]  knowledge  and  of  which  [he]  had  reasonably\n\ntrustworthy information [was] sufficient to warrant a prudent\n\nman  in  believing  that   [Budnick]  had  committed  or  was\n\n                             -10-\n\ncommitting  an offense.\"    Beck v.  Ohio,  379 U.S.  89,  91\n                                         \n\n(1964).5\n\n     Budnick's allegation of unlawful arrest merely recites a\n\nlack  of probable cause and,  in fact, seems  more focused on\n\nanother aspect of his arrest.   Budnick repeatedly points out\n\nthat  Officer Mitchell,  a Harwich  police officer,  arrested\n\nhim,  not in Harwich,  but in Dennis.   He says  that Officer\n\nMitchell, a  Harwich police officer, arrested  him outside of\n\nthe officer's  jurisdiction, in Dennis, on  felony charges (2\n\ncounts of malicious destruction of property  over $250) and a\n\nmisdemeanor charge (disorderly conduct) without a warrant and\n\nnot in \"hot  pursuit.\"  But to proceed with  a   1983 action,\n\nBudnick must show that  this extraterritorial arrest violates\n\na right secured by federal law, Constitutional or statutory.\n                          \n\n     \"Whether  an officer  is  authorized to  make an  arrest\n\nordinarily  depends, in  the first  instance, on  state law.\"\n\nMichigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. at 36.  And in this case the\n                      \n\narrest does not even  appear to be unlawful under  state law.\n\n                    \n\n5.  The mere  fact that Budnick's  mother had not  wished his\narrest  and/or  that  the  charges were  later  dismissed  or\ncontinued without a  finding, of course, is irrelevant to the\nvalidity of the arrest.  See Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S.\n                                                   \nat 36 (stating that \"the mere fact that the suspect is  later\nacquitted  of  the  offense  for  which  he  is  arrested  is\nirrelevant  to  the  validity   of  the  arrest\");  Baker  v.\n                                                         \nMcCollan,  443  U.S. 137,  145  (1979)  (stating that  \"[t]he\n        \nConstitution does not guarantee that only  the guilty will be\narrested.  If it did,    1983 would provide a cause of action\nfor  every defendant  acquitted -  indeed, for  every suspect\nreleased.\").\n\n                             -11-\n\nIt is true  that, under Massachusetts  law, a police  officer\n\nhas no  power  to  make  a  warrantless  arrest  outside  the\n\nboundaries of the governmental unit by which he was appointed\n\nexcept for a fresh pursuit arrest for any arrestable offense,\n\nwhether it be a felony or misdemeanor, initially committed in\n\nthe arresting officer's presence and within his jurisdiction.\n\nCommonwealth  v. LeBlanc, 407 Mass.  70, 72 (1990).   But, \"a\n                        \n\npolice  officer,  while unable  to act  as  an officer  in an\n\nadjoining  jurisdiction, does  not cease  to be a  citizen in\n\nthat jurisdiction  ... and  may lawfully conduct  a citizen's\n\narrest  there  if he  has probable  cause  to believe  that a\n\nfelony has  been committed and  that the person  arrested has\n\ncommitted  it.\"  Commonwealth v. Dise, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 701,\n                                     \n\n704 (1991),  further appellate review denied,  412 Mass. 1102\n                                            \n\n(1992) (footnote omitted).6  And, if there was  authority and\n\nprobable  cause  to  arrest   for  the  felony  of  malicious\n\ndestruction  of property  over $250,  the arrest  was lawful,\n\nregardless of  whether there was authority  or probable cause\n\nalso to arrest for the misdemeanor.  See Barry v. Fowler, 902\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  770, 773  (9th  Cir.  1990)  (an  arrest  is  a  single\n\n                    \n\n6.  Cf. United States v.

Further, even\n\na  liberal reading of the complaint fails to reveal the seeds\n\nof a viable  claim which  would indicate  that any  amendment\n\nmight be  fruitful.   Budnick described the  circumstances of\n\nhis arrest in detail.  The facts pled show probable cause and\n\nlawful authority  to arrest consistent with federal  law.  We\n\nfail to see how any additional facts (and he has not provided\n\nany, either in  his motion  to amend, filed  in the  district\n\ncourt, or even  in his appellate  brief) could be  compatible\n\nwith those already pled and also negate that showing.\n\n                    \n\n7.  We  assume, without  deciding,  that  a  police  officer,\nalthough making  a  citizen's arrest,  would  nonetheless  be\nacting under color  of state law in  making the arrest.   See\n                                                             \nStreet v.  Surdyka, 492 F.2d  368, 374 (4th Cir.  1974).  The\n                  \nopposite  assumption, of course,  dooms the    1983 claim, in\nany event.\n     Moreover, while state  law might prohibit a  warrantless\narrest  for  a misdemeanor  not  committed  in the  officer's\npresence, such a  prohibition is not  grounded in the  Fourth\nAmendment.    Barry v.  Fowler, 902  F.2d  at 772;  Street v.\n                                                          \nSurdyka,  492 F.2d at 370-73;  2 Wayne R.

Pittsley  v.\n                                                         \n\nWarish, 927  F.2d at 9 n.4 (\"In order to have a viable   1983\n      \n\nclaim against a municipality, a state actor must first commit\n\nan underlying constitutional violation.\").\n\n     Budnick's claim  that  Dr. Callis,  the  court-appointed\n\npsychiatrist, misinterpreted his statements and, as a result,\n\nBudnick  was committed  to a  state hospital  for a  week for\n\npsychological testing  and then to a  community mental health\n\ncenter for further  testing fares  no better.8   We pass  the\n\nquestion whether Dr.  Callis is acting  under color of  state\n\nlaw for purposes of    1983 in these circumstances.   Compare\n                                                             \n\nWatterson v. Page,  No. 92-1224,  1993 WL 23908,  at *5  (1st\n                 \n\nCir.

At   best,  the  allegations  state   a  claim  of\n\nnegligence, which is an insufficient basis for a  claim under\n\n  1983.  Watterson  v. Page, No.  92-1224, 1993 WL 23908,  at\n                           \n\n*6.  Budnick's allegation that  Dr. Callis' misinterpretation\n\nwas deliberate does not save this claim from dismissal.  As a\n\nwitness  at a  judicial proceeding,  Dr. Callis  has absolute\n\nimmunity  from     1983   damages  liability  even  were  his\n\ntestimony  false.  Id. at *7.   If false testimony is cloaked\n                      \n\nin immunity, certainly a  deliberate misinterpretation is, as\n\nwell.9\n\n     The  claim  against Attorney  Loesch based  on Budnick's\n\ndissatisfaction  with  his representation  also  was properly\n\ndismissed.   A court-appointed attorney  when representing  a\n\ndefendant in a state  criminal proceeding does not act  under\n\ncolor of state law within the meaning of   1983.  Polk County\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n9.  The    only    allegation   raised    against   defendant\nMassachusetts   Department  of  Public  Safety  is  Budnick's\ncontention that  that entity is  the employer of  Dr. Callis.\nNo viable   1983 claim having been raised against Callis, any\nclaim  against the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety,\nCallis' alleged employer, also fails.  See Watterson v. Page,\n                                                            \nNo. 92-1224, 1993 WL 23908 at *7.

Brennan v.

Finally,  there being  no\n\nallegations  which  would  support  the  exercise  of federal\n\njurisdiction,11  those pendent claims  alleging violations of\n\nthe state  Tort Claims Act,  Mass. Gen.

Consequently,  Budnick's  claim  against the  Barnstable\nCounty Bar  Advocates, Inc., alleged to  be Attorney Loesch's\nemployer,  was  properly  dismissed  as well.    Pittsley  v.\n                                                         \nWarish, 927  F.2d at 9 n.4;  see also Polk County  v.

Budnick's allegation  of a  cause of action  pursuant to\nthe  RICO  statute, 18  U.S.C.    1961  et seq.,  is patently\nmeritless and  warrants no discussion.   See Sedima, S.P.R.L.\n                                                             \nv.  Imrex Co.,  473 U.S.  479, 496  (1985) (listing  elements\n             \nrequired to state a claim).\n\n12.  To the  extent that  Budnick may have  alleged malicious\nprosecution  as itself a  constitutional violation actionable\nunder   1983, we note that malicious prosecution does not per\nse abridge  rights secured by  the Constitution.   Morales v.\n                                                          \nRamirez, 906 F.2d 784,  788 (1st Cir. 1990).   In addition to\n       \nshowing  that  defendants  instituted   criminal  proceedings\n\n                             -16-\n\ndismissed.    Mine Workers  v.

Rather  than  dismiss with  prejudice, however,  we\n\nthink  the  preferable  course  is to  dismiss  these  claims\n\nwithout prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.  Figueroa Ruiz v.\n                                                          \n\nAlegria, 896 F.2d 645,  650 (1st Cir. 1990).   We, therefore,\n       \n\nvacate  the order of the  district court with  respect to the\n\nstate  law claims and direct  that these be dismissed without\n\nprejudice  for lack of jurisdiction.  In so doing, of course,\n\nwe express no opinion as to their viability.\n\n                  IV.  Miscellaneous Motions\n\n     Contemporaneously  with the denial  of Budnick's motions\n\nto vacate the dismissal of the complaint, to vacate the \"with\n\nprejudice\"  designation,  and  to amend  the  complaint,  the\n\ndistrict  court  judge  also denied  a  simultaneously  filed\n\nmotion  to  disqualify himself.    The  motion to  disqualify\n\nalleged that  Budnick intended to file  a judicial misconduct\n\ncomplaint  against the  judge.

The   district  court  disposed  of  the\n                \n\ncomplaint  of  plaintiff/appellant,  Thomas  Budnick,  by the\n\nfollowing order:\n\n               This  Court has  thoroughly reviewed\n          the  plaintiff's Complaint.   It  is rife\n          with    bizarre    factual   and    legal\n          allegations   rendering   it    virtually\n          incomprehensible.      This   Court   has\n          concluded that  the plaintiff's Complaint\n          fails to state a  claim upon which relief\n          can be  granted.  Therefore,  this Court,\n          acting sua sponte, ORDERS that the above-\n                           \n          entitled   action   be   DISMISSED   WITH\n          PREJUDICE.\n               SO ORDERED.\n\nBudnick appeals the dismissal of his complaint with prejudice\n\nand the denial  of his subsequent  motions seeking to  vacate\n\nthe  dismissal, to vacate  the \"with  prejudice\" designation,\n\nand  to  amend his  complaint.   While  we disagree  with the\n\ndistrict  court's  characterization   of  the  complaint   as\n\nvirtually incomprehensible,1 we agree  that it fails to state\n\n                    \n\n1.  To be sure, Budnick's complaint contains references which\nunderstandably may be characterized as bizarre.  Budnick is a\nself-proclaimed  space  prospector,  who  believes  that  the\nUnited  States ought  to continue  its \"manifest  destiny\" by\nclaiming  mineral  rights  on  heavenly bodies,  on  its  own\nbehalf, rather than allowing  space exploration to be pursued\non  behalf of \"common mankind.\"   Using various resources, he\nhas mapped  out mining  claims to plots  on several  planets,\nasteroids, and  the  moon,  which he  believes  are  rich  in\ndiamonds,  gold, platinum,  and other  strategic metals.   He\nsought to file his mining claims in numerous county courts of\nnumerous states, but was rebuffed.  Since 1981, however,  the\nSabine County  Court, in rural  East Texas, has  accepted for\nfiling more than  60 of his mining  claims because, according\nto the court clerk's office, the county needed the money from\nthe filing fees.   Budnick says  that he does  not expect  to\ngain any financial  remuneration; he has filed his  claims in\nthe  names of the heirs of, among others, Sam Houston, Moses,\n\n                             -2-\n\na  claim upon  which  relief can  be  granted.   Further,  we\n\nconclude that any amendment would be futile.  With respect to\n\nthe pendent state  law claims, however, we  believe that they\n\nshould  have been  dismissed  without prejudice  for lack  of\n\n                    \n\nand Martin Luther.\n     Fragmentary references to this hobby (and to field assay\nwork  which  he  has  done  here  on  Earth)  were  scattered\nthroughout  his  complaint.    A somewhat  clearer  frame  of\nreference  emerged  when  Budnick  filed  his  opposition  to\nAttorney Loesch's  motion to dismiss, see  footnote 4, infra,\n                                                            \nand he  submitted copies of several  newspaper accounts which\noutlined this story.\n     Although these factual allegations are odd, they suggest\nthat  Budnick  may  be  eccentric,  but  do  not  support  an\ninference that  he is delusional.   And, while  these factual\nallegations  arguably may  seem  bizarre, they  were not  the\nbasis  for any bizarre legal  allegations.  The complaint, as\ndescribed infra  at 7-8, alleged that  Budnick was unlawfully\n               \narrested  for attempting to cut  down a tree  on his parents'\nproperty  and then held  involuntarily for mental evaluation.\nAt  first blush, it is  puzzling why these  references to his\nhobby  were included  at  all.   A  closer reading  suggests,\nhowever,  that Budnick  proceeded on  the assumption  that he\nmust  present  his entire  case  when  filing his  complaint,\nincluding resulting harm.   And, in his view,  his reputation\nhas  been damaged  by his  confinement for  mental evaluation\nfollowing  his arrest.   Budnick  concedes that  he has  been\nscoffed at  by  many, but,  he  says, people  dismissed  this\ncountry's purchases  of the Louisiana  Territory and  Alaska.\nHis credibility can only  be further weakened, he says,  when\nthose  who  disagree  with   his  support  for  a  continuing\n\"manifest  destiny\" discover  his involuntary  commitment for\npsychiatric  evaluation.   Damage  to  reputation  alone,  of\ncourse,  does not  constitute a  viable  claim under    1983.\nPaul v.

The\n\norder's language - \"the  plaintiff's Complaint fails to state\n\na  claim upon  which relief  can be  granted\" -  suggests the\n\ndismissal  was  pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 12(b)(6).   We\n\nproceed, therefore, on that basis.2\n\n     The standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is a familiar\n\nand oft-repeated one.  \"[A] complaint should not be dismissed\n\nfor failure to state  a claim unless it appears  beyond doubt\n\nthat the  plaintiff can prove no  set of facts in  support of\n\nhis  claim which  would entitle  him to  relief.\"   Conley v.\n                                                          \n\nGibson,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  45-46  (1957).

Although the order of  dismissal stated that the district\ncourt was acting sua sponte, one  of the defendants, Attorney\nSteven Loesch,  had filed a  motion to  dismiss, pursuant  to\nRule  12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim, and Budnick had\nfiled an opposition.  The grounds raised in Attorney Loesch's\nmotion, however, would not  have provided Budnick with notice\nof any potential defects  in his complaint as  to any of  the\nother  eight  defendants,  excepting  perhaps  the  defendant\nBarnstable County Bar Advocates,  Inc., which Budnick alleged\nwas  Loesch's  employer.    We  treat  the  district  court's\ndismissal, therefore, as it,  itself, characterized it - that\nis, as a  sua sponte dismissal.   Our conclusion --  that the\nfailure to  provide  Budnick with  pre-dismissal  notice  and\nopportunity to  respond does not warrant  reversal because it\nis evident that  his complaint  failed to state  a claim  and\nthat no amendment could  remedy it -- necessarily encompasses\na conclusion that there was no error in dismissing  Budnick's\nclaim  against Loesch,  the deficiency  of which  Budnick, in\nfact,  had  notice and  to which  he  had the  opportunity to\nrespond.\n     We  are also aware that the sua sponte dismissal in this\ncase deprived Budnick  of his  right, under Fed.

That\n\nhouse apparently is  in very close proximity  to the boundary\n\nbetween Harwich, and Dennis, Massachusetts.

He was,  at that time, he  alleges, 35 feet\n\ninto  Dennis.   A  Dennis police  officer arrived,  following\n\nwhich Harwich Police Officer Barry Mitchell arrived.  Officer\n\nBarry Mitchell  spent a very  short time in  Budnick's house,\n\nlooking at  what Budnick says  was a leaking  washing machine\n\npipe.   Budnick had purchased  a new washing  machine the day\n\nbefore and was  going to  replace the old  machine.   Officer\n\nBarry  Mitchell  then  came  out  and  arrested  Budnick  for\n\nmalicious destruction  of property over  $250 [apparently the\n\ntree and perhaps the pipe], Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266,   127, and\n\ndisorderly conduct, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272,   53.  Budnick, at\n\nthe time, was standing in Dennis.  Budnick's mother protested\n\nthat she had only wanted the officer to talk to her son.\n\n     Budnick spent  the night at the  Harwich police station.\n\nThe next day, he was taken to court, where he was examined by\n\nDr. Sidney  Callis, a court-appointed  psychiatrist.  Budnick\n\nclaims that Dr.  Callis deliberately misinterpreted Budnick's\n\nstatements  to   him.     The  court  committed   Budnick  to\n\nBridgewater  State Hospital  for psychological  testing.   On\n\nOctober  1, 1990, Budnick was transferred to Cape Cod and the\n\nIslands Community Mental Health Center.\n\n     On  October 12, 1990, Budnick returned to court.  He was\n\nrepresented  by  court-appointed  counsel,   Attorney  Steven\n\nLoesch.    Trial was  set  for  November  6,  1990.   In  the\n\n                             -8-\n\nmeantime,  according to  Budnick,  Loesch made  no effort  to\n\nconduct discovery.\n\n     On November  6th, the malicious  destruction of property\n\ncharges were  dismissed.   The disorderly conduct  charge was\n\ncontinued  without  a finding  for  30  days, whereupon  that\n\ncharge also was dismissed.\n\n     Budnick filed a twenty-one  page, eleven count complaint\n\nseeking  damages against nine  defendants -  (1) the  Town of\n\nHarwich, (2) the Harwich Police Department, (3) the estate of\n\nNorman Fennell, the former  Harwich Police Chief, (4) Officer\n\nJonathan  Mitchell,  (5)  Officer  Barry  Mitchell,  (6)  the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public  Safety, alleged to be the\n\nemployer of Dr.  Callis, (7) Dr.  Callis, (8) the  Barnstable\n\nCounty Bar  Advocates, Inc.,  alleged to  be the  employer of\n\nAttorney  Loesch, and  (9)  Attorney Loesch.   The  complaint\n\nalleged   claims   of  false   arrest,   false  imprisonment,\n\nconspiracy,  intentional  infliction  of emotional  distress,\n\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of  process, and negligence.  It\n\nalleged various bases for jurisdiction, including 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983 and  the Racketeer Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations\n\n(RICO)  statute,  18  U.S.C.    1961  et  seq.,  and  pendent\n\njurisdiction over the state tort claims.\n\n                       III.

Budnick repeatedly points out\n\nthat  Officer Mitchell,  a Harwich  police officer,  arrested\n\nhim,  not in Harwich,  but in Dennis.   He says  that Officer\n\nMitchell, a  Harwich police officer, arrested  him outside of\n\nthe officer's  jurisdiction, in Dennis, on  felony charges (2\n\ncounts of malicious destruction of property  over $250) and a\n\nmisdemeanor charge (disorderly conduct) without a warrant and\n\nnot in \"hot  pursuit.\"  But to proceed with  a   1983 action,\n\nBudnick must show that  this extraterritorial arrest violates\n\na right secured by federal law, Constitutional or statutory.\n                          \n\n     \"Whether  an officer  is  authorized to  make an  arrest\n\nordinarily  depends, in  the first  instance, on  state law.\"\n\nMichigan v.

The mere  fact that Budnick's  mother had not  wished his\narrest  and/or  that  the  charges were  later  dismissed  or\ncontinued without a  finding, of course, is irrelevant to the\nvalidity of the arrest.

To the  extent that  Budnick may have  alleged malicious\nprosecution  as itself a  constitutional violation actionable\nunder   1983, we note that malicious prosecution does not per\nse abridge  rights secured by  the Constitution.

We, therefore,\n       \n\nvacate  the order of the  district court with  respect to the\n\nstate  law claims and direct  that these be dismissed without\n\nprejudice  for lack of jurisdiction.  In so doing, of course,\n\nwe express no opinion as to their viability.\n\n                  IV.  Miscellaneous Motions\n\n     Contemporaneously  with the denial  of Budnick's motions\n\nto vacate the dismissal of the complaint, to vacate the \"with\n\nprejudice\"  designation,  and  to amend  the  complaint,  the\n\ndistrict  court  judge  also denied  a  simultaneously  filed\n\nmotion  to  disqualify himself.    The  motion to  disqualify\n\nalleged that  Budnick intended to file  a judicial misconduct\n\ncomplaint  against the  judge.   Budnick claims  the district\n\ncourt  erred in ruling on his motions after being notified of\n\nhis intent to  file a complaint.   There was  no error.
