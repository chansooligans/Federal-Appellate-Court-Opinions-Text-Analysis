Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                  Boudin, Howard and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Stephen C. Pfaff and Louison, Costello, Condon & Pfaff, LLP,\non brief for appellants.\n     Ellen M. Caulo, Deputy General Counsel, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         September 14, 2010\n\f            Per    Curiam.      Plaintiffs-appellants     appeal      from   the\n\ndistrict court's award of costs for deposition transcripts over\n\ntheir objections that the motion for bill of costs was untimely and\n\nthat some of the transcripts were not used at trial.             We affirm.\n\n            Defendant-appellee, Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral\n\nwas the prevailing party in this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit brought by\n\nplaintiffs-appellants, ten former jail officers at the Suffolk\n\nCounty Sheriff's Department. Cabral filed a motion for an award of\n\ndeposition costs in the amount of $13,311.45.            Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe motion for costs on the ground that it was untimely, and that\n\nsome of the depositions were not actually introduced into evidence\n\nor used at trial and, therefore, should not have been taxed as\n\ncosts.    In granting the motion for bill of costs, the district\n\ncourt    ruled    that   the   one-month   delay   in   filing   it    was   not\n\n\"excessive or prejudicial to plaintiffs,\" and that the claimed\n\ncosts were \"reasonable and authorized by statute.\"                 Plaintiffs\n\nappeal from that ruling.\n\n            \"The award or denial of costs is generally reviewed only\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.\" 10 James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal\n\nPractice, §54.100[4][b] (3d ed. 1997).             As the district court\n\nstated, and neither party disputes, \"[n]either the Federal Rules\n\nnor the Local Rules of this court set a deadline for the filing of\n\na Bill of Costs.\"        \"If the local rules do not address the issue, a\n\nmotion for costs is not subject to any particular time limitation,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fbut   instead    must    be    filed   within   a    reasonable      time.\"    Id.,\n\n§54.100[1][a].\n\n            The district court's website sets forth the procedure for\n\nfiling a bill of costs in that court, including a fifteen-day time\n\nperiod which the website characterizes as \"an informal practice,\n\nrather than a formalized local rule.\" The defendant filed her bill\n\nof costs 45 days after the expiration of the time to appeal instead\n\nof 15 days after.1            The district court's website specifically\n\nprovides that allowance should be made for \"litigants who file late\n\nbut claim, in good faith, that they were not aware of the time\n\nrestriction.\"     The defendant, whose attorney filed an affidavit\n\nstating her ignorance of the 15-day time period, falls within that\n\ncategory.\n\n            In   their    brief,   appellants       argue   that    granting   the\n\ndefendant's delayed motion for costs represents a \"dereliction of\n\nthe Court's rules\" and \"disturbs finality.\"                 However, given that\n\nthe district court treats the fifteen-day time period as \"an\n\ninformal practice, rather than a formalized local rule,\" and\n\nspecifically     allows   for    exceptions     under   these      circumstances,\n\nappellants' objections are unfounded.            The district court did not\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Judgment entered on 8/24/09 and the 30-day appeal period\nexpired on 9/23/09.    Therefore, under the \"informal practice\"\nwithin the District of Massachusetts, Cabral should have filed her\nmotion for bill of costs by 10/8/09.       Instead, she filed it\napproximately one month later, on 11/9/09.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fabuse its discretion in failing to deny the motion for costs as\n\nuntimely.\n\n            Appellants also object that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion       in   awarding   costs   for   the   preparation   of   certain\n\ndepositions which were not \"used at trial.\"                Defendants sought\n\ntaxation    of    costs   for    the   deposition    transcripts   of   the   ten\n\noriginal plaintiffs and six current or former employees of the\n\nSuffolk County Sheriff's Department.             The claims of four of the\n\nplaintiffs had been dismissed at the summary judgment stage.\n\nPlaintiffs object that the deposition transcripts of those four\n\nplaintiffs were not \"used at trial\" and therefore should not be\n\ntaxed as costs.         They further object that because non-plaintiff\n\ndepartment employees Elizabeth Keeley and Eugene Sumpter did not\n\ntestify at trial, their depositions also should not have been taxed\n\nas costs.\n\n            This court has held that deposition costs are taxable if\n\nthey \"are either introduced into evidence or used at trial,\" and\n\nthat \"[i]t is within the discretion of the district court to tax\n\ndeposition costs if special circumstances warrant it, even though\n\nthe depositions were not put into evidence or used at the trial.\"\n\nTempleman v. Chris Craft Corp., 770 F.2d 245, 249 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\nThe record establishes, and plaintiffs do not dispute, that the\n\ndepositions to which appellants object were filed with the district\n\ncourt in support of the partially-successful motion for summary\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fjudgment.    Therefore, the transcripts were \"necessarily obtained\n\nfor use in the case.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1920(2). See 10 Charles Alan\n\nWright, Arthur R. Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure, § 2676, p. 423 (3d ed. 1998) (\"[t]he justification for\n\ntaxing the expense of a deposition that is introduced into evidence\n\nalso supports taxing the expense of a deposition employed on a\n\nsuccessful   motion     for   summary   judgment\");   10   Moore's   Federal\n\nPractice, supra, § 54.103[3][c] (explaining that a deposition's\n\nnecessity is established if it is \"used in pretrial proceedings,\n\nsuch as on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment\").               The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs for\n\nall of the claimed depositions.         See Whitfield v. Scully, 241 F.3d\n\n264, 271-272 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n            Affirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
