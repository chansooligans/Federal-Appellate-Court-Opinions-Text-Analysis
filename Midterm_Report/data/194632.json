Appellant Atlantic  Track &amp;\n                                   \n\nTurnout  Company (\"Atlantic\")  brought  this  breach of  contract\n\naction pursuant  to the  Uniform Commercial Code  (\"Code\"), Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch.  106,   2-101, et seq. (1992).  Atlantic alleged that\n                                  \n\nappellee Perini Corporation (\"Perini\")  failed to perform under a\n\ncontract for the purchase and sale of railroad materials.\n\n          The  court  deferred  decision  on  cross  motions  for\n\nsummary judgment and ordered a trial  limited to two issues:  (1)\n\nwhether the contract  was ambiguous; and (2)  whether trade usage\n\nwould  supplement  the  contract  terms  to  enable  Atlantic  to\n\nmaintain its action.  After Atlantic's proffer, the court entered\n\na  judgment on  partial  findings pursuant  to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\n\n52(c)1 in favor of Perini.  We affirm that judgment.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          On   October   21,    1987,   the   Massachusetts   Bay\n\nTransportation  Authority (\"MBTA\")  awarded  Perini  the  Eastern\n\nRoute Track Rehabilitation Project.   The project required Perini\n\nto rehabilitate a  thirteen mile  section of double  track.   The\n\nrehabilitation  included undercutting  the  track to  replace the\n\nballast,  the  track's stone  foundation,  and  disposing of  any\n\n                    \n\n1  Rule 52(c) provides in relevant part:\n\n            If during a trial  without a jury a party\n            has been  fully heard with respect  to an\n            issue  and  the court  finds  against the\n            party on that issue, the  court may enter\n            judgment as  a matter of law against that\n            party  on any  claim  . .  . that  cannot\n            under  controlling  law be  maintained or\n            defeated without a  favorable finding  on\n            that issue . . . .\n\n                               -2-\n\ncontaminated ballast materials.\n\n          In  the spring  of  1988, a  sub-contractor tested  the\n\nballast   under  the  track  and  determined   that  it  was  all\n\ncontaminated.   Perini received the test results on June 21, 1988\n\nand discussed them with the MBTA on July 17, 1988.\n\n          In  early June,  1988, Perini  solicited an  offer from\n\nAtlantic to buy certain  salvage from the project.   Between June\n\n28  and 30, 1988, Atlantic  issued five purchase  orders for \"all\n\navailable\" materials.   The orders also furnished  an estimate of\n\nthe amount of salvage that would become available.\n\n          On August 18, 1988, the MBTA directed Perini to suspend\n\nundercutting operations  until further notice.   On September 13,\n\n1988, the MBTA  permanently halted all undercutting due to fiscal\n\nconstraints.  As the elimination of the  undercutting reduced the\n\nvalue  of the  contract  by 52%,  Perini  stopped all  work.   By\n\nOctober 26, Perini had no physical presence on the project site.\n\n          On  October  31,  1988,  Perini proposed  an  equitable\n\nadjustment  of  the MBTA  contract.    The proposal  entailed  an\n\nincrease in payment  for completion of  the remaining work  under\n\nthe contract.  The  MBTA rejected Perini's proposal.   Perini and\n\nthe MBTA thus agreed to terminate the contract.\n\n          Atlantic knew by August  22, 1988 that all undercutting\n\nwas  suspended and later asked  Perini when the  remainder of the\n\nmaterials would be available.  Perini replied that the MBTA might\n\nterminate the project  and that Perini  had already shipped  \"all\n\n                               -3-\n\navailable\"  salvage  in  accordance with  the  purchase  orders.2\n\nAtlantic  sued  Perini, claiming  that  the  amount of  materials\n\nshipped was well below the stated estimates.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          Two reasonable interpretations of the  contract's plain\n\nlanguage exist.  On one hand, \"all available\" implies that Perini\n\nsatisfied  its obligation  under  the contract  by supplying  the\n\nsalvage  material that  became available;  if no  material became\n\navailable  to  Perini,  Perini   faced  no  liability  under  the\n\ncontract.3    On the  other hand,  the  estimates offered  in the\n\npurchase orders  suggest that  Perini had  to deliver  a quantity\n\nnearing those estimates.\n\n          To  convince the  court that the  latter interpretation\n\nrepresented  the true  agreement,  Atlantic had  to overcome  two\n\nhurdles.  First,  as the  plaintiff, Atlantic had  the burden  of\n\nproving its  interpretation by  a preponderance of  the evidence.\n\nSecond,  any  ambiguity  in   the  contract  should  normally  be\n\ninterpreted against Atlantic, the drafter of the purchase orders.\n\nLFC Lessors, Inc.  v. Pacific  Sewer Maintenance, 739  F.2d 4,  7\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1984).\n\n          Atlantic offered two theories beyond the plain language\n\nof  the  contract supporting  its  interpretation  of the  terms.\n\nSpecifically,  Atlantic argued that:  (1) trade usage of the term\n\n                    \n\n2  At  this point, Perini had delivered approximately  15% of the\nmaterials estimated. \n\n3  Of course, the Code requires that Perini attempt to attain the\nmaterials in good faith.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-306.\n\n                               -4-\n\n\"all available\" required Perini to deliver close to the estimated\n\nquantity  of materials,  and (2)    2-306  of the  Code expressly\n\nrequired Perini  to provide  a quantity approximating  its stated\n\nestimate.   In addition, Atlantic argued that Perini acted in bad\n\nfaith.   Atlantic revives these  theories in this  appeal, and we\n\naddress them in turn.\n\n          I.  Trade Usage\n\n          The district  court ruled  that Atlantic's  trade usage\n\nproffer failed to prove  by a preponderance of the  evidence that\n\nthe contract terms embodied Atlantic's proposed meaning.  As this\n\nconclusion constitutes a factual finding,  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106,\n\n  1-205(2),  we review it only  for clear error,  Athas v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 904 F.2d 79, 80 (1st Cir. 1990).\n      \n\n          Trade  usage will  supplement the  terms of  a contract\n\nonly when the  parties know or should know of  that usage.  Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 106,   1-205(3).  In   the  present   case,  Atlantic\n\nprovided no evidence  that Perini  knew or should  have known  of\n\nAtlantic's interpretation of the term \"all available.\"  There was\n\nno  evidence that Perini engaged  in the same  trade as Atlantic.\n\nIndeed,  one Atlantic  witness testified  that Perini  was not  a\n\ncompetitor of Atlantic's.  Transcript, Non-Jury Trial Proceedings\n\n-  Day  1, at  106.   Therefore,  we cannot  assume  knowledge of\n\nAtlantic's  trade  practices.    Furthermore,   another  Atlantic\n\nwitness  testified that  he discussed  the terms of  the contract\n\nwith  a Perini  representative, but  never explained  the alleged\n\ntrade usage of  \"all available.\"  Id.  at 70.  Given  the lack of\n                                    \n\n                               -5-\n\nevidence, we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding  that  the  proposed trade  usage  of  the  term did  not\n\nsupplement the contract terms.\n\n          II.  Section 2-306\n\n          Both  parties   agree   that  the   disputed   contract\n\nconstitutes an output contract  governed by   2-306 of  the Code.\n\nSection 2-306 of the Code provides in relevant part:\n\n            (1) A term which measures the quantity by\n            the output of the seller . . . means such\n            actual output . . .  as may occur in good\n            faith,    except    that   no    quantity\n            unreasonably   disproportionate   to  any\n            stated estimate . .  . may be tendered or\n            demanded.\n\n          In the present case,  the contract provided an estimate\n\nof  the expected  output, and  Perini tendered  only 15%  of that\n\nquantity.   Thus,  Atlantic argues  that  according to     2-306,\n\nPerini violated the contract.\n\n          While many  courts and commentators have  discussed the\n\nmeaning of the \"unreasonably  disproportionate\" clause of   2-306\n\nas applied  to requirements  contracts, little, if  anything, has\n\nbeen written on the clause's application to output contracts.  We\n\nreview the former analysis, however, because it provides valuable\n\ninstruction  due to  the  similarity between  these two  types of\n\ncontracts.\n\n          With  respect to requirements  contracts, courts differ\n\non  the  meaning of  the \"unreasonably  disproportionate\" clause.\n\nSome  courts find that \"even  where one party  acts with complete\n\ngood  faith,  the  section  limits  the  other  party's  risk  in\n\n                               -6-\n\naccordance  with the  reasonable  expectations  of the  parties.\"\n\nOrange Rockland  v. Amerada Hess,  397 N.Y.S.2d 814,  819 (1977).\n                                \n\nMost  courts and commentators, however, treat  cases in which the\n\nbuyer  demands more  than  the stated  estimate differently  than\n\ncases in  which the buyer  demands less.   See, e.g.,  Empire Gas\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.  v. American Bakeries Co., 840 F.2d 1333, 1337-38 (7th Cir.\n                               \n\n1988); Angelica  Uniform Group, Inc. v.  Ponderosa Systems, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n636 F.2d 232,  232 (8th Cir. 1980) (per curiam);  R.A.

Asphalt  Construction, Inc., 587  F.2d 1315,\n                                                \n\n1322  (D.C. Cir. 1978).  The courts that employ separate analyses\n\nhold  that  while     2-306 precludes  buyers  from  demanding  a\n\nquantity  of goods  that  is unreasonably  disproportionate to  a\n\nstated  estimate,  it permits  \"good  faith  reductions that  are\n                                                       \n\nhighly disproportionate.\"  R.A.  Weaver and Associates, Inc., 587\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1315 (emphasis added).4\n\n          The Seventh Circuit explained the argument well, Empire\n                                                                 \n\nGas  Corp.,  840 F.2d  at 1338-40,  and  we adopt  its reasoning.\n          \n\nEssentially, the  argument is  the following.   The \"unreasonably\n\ndisproportionate\" clause  is somewhat  redundant in light  of the\n\ngood faith requirement in that section.  The clause therefore was\n\n                    \n\n4  The  comments to the  Code shed little  light on the  issue as\nthey,  too, are ambiguous.  Empire Gas Corp. v. American Bakeries\n                                                                 \nCo.,  840 F.2d  at 1338.    Comment 3  to    2-306, for  example,\n   \nprovides that an  \"agreed estimate is to be  regarded as a center\naround  which  the  parties   intend  the  variation  to  occur,\"\nsuggesting that  the two situations should  be treated similarly.\nComment 2  to   2-306, on  the other hand supports  the view that\nthe  two  situations should  receive  different  treatment as  it\nprovides that \"good faith  variations from prior requirements are\npermitted even  when the variation  may be such  as to result  in\ndiscontinuance.\"  \n\n                               -7-\n\nlikely provided to  explain the good faith term.   The good faith\n\nrequirement with respect to disproportionately  increased demands\n\nneeded  explanation  as certain  forms  of  exploitation in  that\n\nsituation do not clearly  constitute bad faith.  For  example, if\n\nthe  market price of the  subject goods rises  above the contract\n\nprice, a buyer  in a  requirements contract might  be tempted  to\n\ndemand more goods than it truly needs in order to resell them for\n\nthe better market price.  The clause eliminates that opportunity.\n\nOn  the  other hand,  exploitation, beyond  bad  faith, is  not a\n\nconcern  if a  buyer demands  less than  a stated estimate.   The\n\nseller  has the  opportunity to  sell any  excess of  the subject\n\ngoods on the market.\n\n          Moreover, an obligation  to buy approximately  a stated\n\nestimate of goods would pose a significant burden on buyers as it\n\nwould force them to make inefficient business judgments, when the\n\npoint of entering a requirements contract was to engage suppliers\n\nwithout  binding themselves  to buy  more  goods than  they need.\n\nEssentially,   a   requirements   contract  represents   a   risk\n\nallocation.   \"The seller  assumes the  risk of  a change  in the\n\nbuyer's  business that makes continuation  . . .  costly, but the\n\nbuyer   assumes  the  risk  of   a  less  urgent   change  in  []\n\ncircumstances.\"  Id. at 1340.\n                   \n\n          The  same  rationale  supports  different  treatment of\n\ncases such as  the present one, in which the  seller in an output\n\ncontract tenders less than a stated estimate, from cases in which\n\nthe seller  tenders more.   If  a  seller saw  an opportunity  to\n\n                               -8-\n\nincrease his  profits by  buying  additional goods  to resell  as\n\noutput  to the  buyer, this  exploitation might  not conclusively\n\nestablish bad faith.  The proviso would forbid such conduct.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.  at  1338.    On  the  other  hand,  an  obligation  to  sell\n  \n\napproximately  the stated estimate  may force the  seller to make\n\ninefficient  business decisions  that the  seller did  not likely\n\nintend  when  he  bargained   to  keep  the  contract's  quantity\n\nprovision open.\n\n          Like the risk allocation  in the requirements contract,\n\nthe output contract allocates to the  buyer the risk of a  change\n\nin the  seller's business  that makes continuation  costly, while\n\nthe   seller  assumes  the  risk  of  a  less  urgent  change  in\n\ncircumstances.  Indeed,  pre-Code Massachusetts courts  held that\n\noutput  contracts necessarily  contemplated  that  the  level  of\n\nproduction  would   be  governed  by  business   judgment.    See\n                                                                 \n\nNeofotistos v. Harvard  Brewing Co., 171  N.E.2d 865, 868  (Mass.\n                                   \n\n1961).  We see no reason for a change in that rationale.\n\n          Adopting this interpretation of    2-306, our next, and\n\nonly  inquiry under this section, is whether Perini acted in good\n\nfaith.\n\n          III.  Good faith\n\n          The district court determined that Perini acted in good\n\nfaith.  This was a factual determination that we review only  for\n\nclear error.  Athas, 904 F.2d at 80.\n                   \n\n          Atlantic offers two indications of bad faith by Perini.\n\nFirst,  Atlantic argues that Perini acted in bad faith by failing\n\n                               -9-\n\nto  notify  Atlantic  of the  June  21  test  results.   However,\n\nAtlantic  offered no  evidence that  the additional  contaminated\n\nballast signified to Perini that the contract would end.  Indeed,\n\nthe record  indicates that the additional  contamination was good\n\nnews to Perini because the  more contamination that existed,  the\n\nmore money Perini stood to earn under the contract.  The MBTA did\n\nnot notify  Perini of its desire to end the contract until August\n\n18  when it suspended  the undercutting; Atlantic  learned of the\n\nsuspension just four days later.  Thus, the court did not clearly\n\nerr in finding  that Perini acted in  good faith with  respect to\n\nnotification.\n\n          Second, Atlantic argues that  Perini acted in bad faith\n\nby  failing to  make a  reasonable attempt  to complete  the MBTA\n\nproject  when the  MBTA  eliminated the  undercutting.   Atlantic\n\ncontends that  in its negotiations for an equitable adjustment of\n\nthe contract,  Perini requested  an unreasonable increase  in the\n\ncontract price.   Thus, Atlantic argues that Perini's  attempt to\n\ncomplete the project was in bad faith.  \n\n          Based on the evidence presented, however, this argument\n\nfails.    For  one thing,  a  contractor  may  seek an  equitable\n\nadjustment  to  the contract  when a  large  quantity of  work is\n\neliminated.  See Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. v. United States, 109 Ct.\n                                                        \n\nCl. 517, 522-23 (1947).  Atlantic failed to show that Perini  did\n\nnot make  reasonable attempts to  negotiate an adjustment.   That\n\nthe  MBTA and Perini failed to reach an acceptable agreement does\n\nnot show that the attempted negotiations were in bad faith. \n\n                               -10-\n\n          Moreover,  a  party  who ceases  performance  under  an\n\noutput  contract for  independent business  reasons acts  in good\n\nfaith.   Neofotistos, 171  N.E.2d at 868.     Atlantic offered no\n                    \n\nevidence that Perini did  not agree to end the  MBTA contract due\n\nto a valid independent business reason.  Indeed, Atlantic offered\n\nno evidence of any reason why Perini agreed to  end the contract.\n\nThus, the  district court did not  clearly err in  its good faith\n\ndetermination.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Based  on  the evidence  presented, the  district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment in favor of Perini.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -11-\n",

L. ch.  106,   2-101, et seq. (1992).  Atlantic alleged that\n                                  \n\nappellee Perini Corporation (\"Perini\")  failed to perform under a\n\ncontract for the purchase and sale of railroad materials.\n\n          The  court  deferred  decision  on  cross  motions  for\n\nsummary judgment and ordered a trial  limited to two issues:  (1)\n\nwhether the contract  was ambiguous; and (2)  whether trade usage\n\nwould  supplement  the  contract  terms  to  enable  Atlantic  to\n\nmaintain its action.  After Atlantic's proffer, the court entered\n\na  judgment on  partial  findings pursuant  to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\n\n52(c)1 in favor of Perini.  We affirm that judgment.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          On   October   21,    1987,   the   Massachusetts   Bay\n\nTransportation  Authority (\"MBTA\")  awarded  Perini  the  Eastern\n\nRoute Track Rehabilitation Project.   The project required Perini\n\nto rehabilitate a  thirteen mile  section of double  track.   The\n\nrehabilitation  included undercutting  the  track to  replace the\n\nballast,  the  track's stone  foundation,  and  disposing of  any\n\n                    \n\n1  Rule 52(c) provides in relevant part:\n\n            If during a trial  without a jury a party\n            has been  fully heard with respect  to an\n            issue  and  the court  finds  against the\n            party on that issue, the  court may enter\n            judgment as  a matter of law against that\n            party  on any  claim  . .  . that  cannot\n            under  controlling  law be  maintained or\n            defeated without a  favorable finding  on\n            that issue . . . .\n\n                               -2-\n\ncontaminated ballast materials.\n\n          In  the spring  of  1988, a  sub-contractor tested  the\n\nballast   under  the  track  and  determined   that  it  was  all\n\ncontaminated.   Perini received the test results on June 21, 1988\n\nand discussed them with the MBTA on July 17, 1988.\n\n          In  early June,  1988, Perini  solicited an  offer from\n\nAtlantic to buy certain  salvage from the project.   Between June\n\n28  and 30, 1988, Atlantic  issued five purchase  orders for \"all\n\navailable\" materials.   The orders also furnished  an estimate of\n\nthe amount of salvage that would become available.\n\n          On August 18, 1988, the MBTA directed Perini to suspend\n\nundercutting operations  until further notice.   On September 13,\n\n1988, the MBTA  permanently halted all undercutting due to fiscal\n\nconstraints.  As the elimination of the  undercutting reduced the\n\nvalue  of the  contract  by 52%,  Perini  stopped all  work.   By\n\nOctober 26, Perini had no physical presence on the project site.\n\n          On  October  31,  1988,  Perini proposed  an  equitable\n\nadjustment  of  the MBTA  contract.    The proposal  entailed  an\n\nincrease in payment  for completion of  the remaining work  under\n\nthe contract.  The  MBTA rejected Perini's proposal.   Perini and\n\nthe MBTA thus agreed to terminate the contract.\n\n          Atlantic knew by August  22, 1988 that all undercutting\n\nwas  suspended and later asked  Perini when the  remainder of the\n\nmaterials would be available.  Perini replied that the MBTA might\n\nterminate the project  and that Perini  had already shipped  \"all\n\n                               -3-\n\navailable\"  salvage  in  accordance with  the  purchase  orders.2\n\nAtlantic  sued  Perini, claiming  that  the  amount of  materials\n\nshipped was well below the stated estimates.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          Two reasonable interpretations of the  contract's plain\n\nlanguage exist.  On one hand, \"all available\" implies that Perini\n\nsatisfied  its obligation  under  the contract  by supplying  the\n\nsalvage  material that  became available;  if no  material became\n\navailable  to  Perini,  Perini   faced  no  liability  under  the\n\ncontract.3    On the  other hand,  the  estimates offered  in the\n\npurchase orders  suggest that  Perini had  to deliver  a quantity\n\nnearing those estimates.\n\n          To  convince the  court that the  latter interpretation\n\nrepresented  the true  agreement,  Atlantic had  to overcome  two\n\nhurdles.  First,  as the  plaintiff, Atlantic had  the burden  of\n\nproving its  interpretation by  a preponderance of  the evidence.\n\nSecond,  any  ambiguity  in   the  contract  should  normally  be\n\ninterpreted against Atlantic, the drafter of the purchase orders.\n\nLFC Lessors, Inc.  v.

In addition, Atlantic argued that Perini acted in bad\n\nfaith.   Atlantic revives these  theories in this  appeal, and we\n\naddress them in turn.\n\n          I.  Trade Usage\n\n          The district  court ruled  that Atlantic's  trade usage\n\nproffer failed to prove  by a preponderance of the  evidence that\n\nthe contract terms embodied Atlantic's proposed meaning.

Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 106,   1-205(3).  In   the  present   case,  Atlantic\n\nprovided no evidence  that Perini  knew or should  have known  of\n\nAtlantic's interpretation of the term \"all available.\"  There was\n\nno  evidence that Perini engaged  in the same  trade as Atlantic.\n\nIndeed,  one Atlantic  witness testified  that Perini  was not  a\n\ncompetitor of Atlantic's.  Transcript, Non-Jury Trial Proceedings\n\n-  Day  1, at  106.   Therefore,  we cannot  assume  knowledge of\n\nAtlantic's  trade  practices.    Furthermore,   another  Atlantic\n\nwitness  testified that  he discussed  the terms of  the contract\n\nwith  a Perini  representative, but  never explained  the alleged\n\ntrade usage of  \"all available.\"  Id.  at 70.  Given  the lack of\n                                    \n\n                               -5-\n\nevidence, we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding  that  the  proposed trade  usage  of  the  term did  not\n\nsupplement the contract terms.\n\n          II.  Section 2-306\n\n          Both  parties   agree   that  the   disputed   contract\n\nconstitutes an output contract  governed by   2-306 of  the Code.\n\nSection 2-306 of the Code provides in relevant part:\n\n            (1) A term which measures the quantity by\n            the output of the seller . . . means such\n            actual output . . .  as may occur in good\n            faith,    except    that   no    quantity\n            unreasonably   disproportionate   to  any\n            stated estimate . .  . may be tendered or\n            demanded.\n\n          In the present case,  the contract provided an estimate\n\nof  the expected  output, and  Perini tendered  only 15%  of that\n\nquantity.   Thus,  Atlantic argues  that  according to     2-306,\n\nPerini violated the contract.\n\n          While many  courts and commentators have  discussed the\n\nmeaning of the \"unreasonably  disproportionate\" clause of   2-306\n\nas applied  to requirements  contracts, little, if  anything, has\n\nbeen written on the clause's application to output contracts.  We\n\nreview the former analysis, however, because it provides valuable\n\ninstruction  due to  the  similarity between  these two  types of\n\ncontracts.\n\n          With  respect to requirements  contracts, courts differ\n\non  the  meaning of  the \"unreasonably  disproportionate\" clause.\n\nSome  courts find that \"even  where one party  acts with complete\n\ngood  faith,  the  section  limits  the  other  party's  risk  in\n\n                               -6-\n\naccordance  with the  reasonable  expectations  of the  parties.\"\n\nOrange Rockland  v.

The courts that employ separate analyses\n\nhold  that  while     2-306 precludes  buyers  from  demanding  a\n\nquantity  of goods  that  is unreasonably  disproportionate to  a\n\nstated  estimate,  it permits  \"good  faith  reductions that  are\n                                                       \n\nhighly disproportionate.\"  R.A.

The \"unreasonably\n\ndisproportionate\" clause  is somewhat  redundant in light  of the\n\ngood faith requirement in that section.  The clause therefore was\n\n                    \n\n4  The  comments to the  Code shed little  light on the  issue as\nthey,  too, are ambiguous.  Empire Gas Corp. v. American Bakeries\n                                                                 \nCo.,  840 F.2d  at 1338.    Comment 3  to    2-306, for  example,\n   \nprovides that an  \"agreed estimate is to be  regarded as a center\naround  which  the  parties   intend  the  variation  to  occur,\"\nsuggesting that  the two situations should  be treated similarly.\nComment 2  to   2-306, on  the other hand supports  the view that\nthe  two  situations should  receive  different  treatment as  it\nprovides that \"good faith  variations from prior requirements are\npermitted even  when the variation  may be such  as to result  in\ndiscontinuance.\"  \n\n                               -7-\n\nlikely provided to  explain the good faith term.   The good faith\n\nrequirement with respect to disproportionately  increased demands\n\nneeded  explanation  as certain  forms  of  exploitation in  that\n\nsituation do not clearly  constitute bad faith.  For  example, if\n\nthe  market price of the  subject goods rises  above the contract\n\nprice, a buyer  in a  requirements contract might  be tempted  to\n\ndemand more goods than it truly needs in order to resell them for\n\nthe better market price.  The clause eliminates that opportunity.\n\nOn  the  other hand,  exploitation, beyond  bad  faith, is  not a\n\nconcern  if a  buyer demands  less than  a stated estimate.   The\n\nseller  has the  opportunity to  sell any  excess of  the subject\n\ngoods on the market.\n\n          Moreover, an obligation  to buy approximately  a stated\n\nestimate of goods would pose a significant burden on buyers as it\n\nwould force them to make inefficient business judgments, when the\n\npoint of entering a requirements contract was to engage suppliers\n\nwithout  binding themselves  to buy  more  goods than  they need.\n\nEssentially,   a   requirements   contract  represents   a   risk\n\nallocation.   \"The seller  assumes the  risk of  a change  in the\n\nbuyer's  business that makes continuation  . . .  costly, but the\n\nbuyer   assumes  the  risk  of   a  less  urgent   change  in  []\n\ncircumstances.\"  Id. at 1340.\n                   \n\n          The  same  rationale  supports  different  treatment of\n\ncases such as  the present one, in which the  seller in an output\n\ncontract tenders less than a stated estimate, from cases in which\n\nthe seller  tenders more.   If  a  seller saw  an opportunity  to\n\n                               -8-\n\nincrease his  profits by  buying  additional goods  to resell  as\n\noutput  to the  buyer, this  exploitation might  not conclusively\n\nestablish bad faith.  The proviso would forbid such conduct.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.  at  1338.    On  the  other  hand,  an  obligation  to  sell\n  \n\napproximately  the stated estimate  may force the  seller to make\n\ninefficient  business decisions  that the  seller did  not likely\n\nintend  when  he  bargained   to  keep  the  contract's  quantity\n\nprovision open.\n\n          Like the risk allocation  in the requirements contract,\n\nthe output contract allocates to the  buyer the risk of a  change\n\nin the  seller's business  that makes continuation  costly, while\n\nthe   seller  assumes  the  risk  of  a  less  urgent  change  in\n\ncircumstances.  Indeed,  pre-Code Massachusetts courts  held that\n\noutput  contracts necessarily  contemplated  that  the  level  of\n\nproduction  would   be  governed  by  business   judgment.    See\n                                                                 \n\nNeofotistos v. Harvard  Brewing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868  (Mass.\n                                   \n\n1961).  We see no reason for a change in that rationale.\n\n          Adopting this interpretation of    2-306, our next, and\n\nonly  inquiry under this section, is whether Perini acted in good\n\nfaith.\n\n          III.  Good faith\n\n          The district court determined that Perini acted in good\n\nfaith.  This was a factual determination that we review only  for\n\nclear error.  Athas, 904 F.2d at 80.\n                   \n\n          Atlantic offers two indications of bad faith by Perini.\n\nFirst,  Atlantic argues that Perini acted in bad faith by failing\n\n                               -9-\n\nto  notify  Atlantic  of the  June  21  test  results.   However,\n\nAtlantic  offered no  evidence that  the additional  contaminated\n\nballast signified to Perini that the contract would end.  Indeed,\n\nthe record  indicates that the additional  contamination was good\n\nnews to Perini because the  more contamination that existed,  the\n\nmore money Perini stood to earn under the contract.  The MBTA did\n\nnot notify  Perini of its desire to end the contract until August\n\n18  when it suspended  the undercutting; Atlantic  learned of the\n\nsuspension just four days later.  Thus, the court did not clearly\n\nerr in finding  that Perini acted in  good faith with  respect to\n\nnotification.\n\n          Second, Atlantic argues that  Perini acted in bad faith\n\nby  failing to  make a  reasonable attempt  to complete  the MBTA\n\nproject  when the  MBTA  eliminated the  undercutting.   Atlantic\n\ncontends that  in its negotiations for an equitable adjustment of\n\nthe contract,  Perini requested  an unreasonable increase  in the\n\ncontract price.   Thus, Atlantic argues that Perini's  attempt to\n\ncomplete the project was in bad faith.  \n\n          Based on the evidence presented, however, this argument\n\nfails.    For  one thing,  a  contractor  may  seek an  equitable\n\nadjustment  to  the contract  when a  large  quantity of  work is\n\neliminated.  See Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. v. United States, 109 Ct.\n                                                        \n\nCl. 517, 522-23 (1947).  Atlantic failed to show that Perini  did\n\nnot make  reasonable attempts to  negotiate an adjustment.   That\n\nthe  MBTA and Perini failed to reach an acceptable agreement does\n\nnot show that the attempted negotiations were in bad faith. \n\n                               -10-\n\n          Moreover,  a  party  who ceases  performance  under  an\n\noutput  contract for  independent business  reasons acts  in good\n\nfaith.   Neofotistos, 171  N.E.2d at 868.     Atlantic offered no\n                    \n\nevidence that Perini did  not agree to end the  MBTA contract due\n\nto a valid independent business reason.  Indeed, Atlantic offered\n\nno evidence of any reason why Perini agreed to  end the contract.\n\nThus, the  district court did not  clearly err in  its good faith\n\ndetermination.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Based  on  the evidence  presented, the  district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment in favor of Perini.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -11-\n</pre>",
