The Dispute\n               \n\n          This case involves  a compensation dispute  between\n\nplaintiffs, seventy-nine former Massachusetts insurance sales\n\nagents  (\"Agents\"), and  their  employer, defendant  Allstate\n\nInsurance Company (\"Allstate\").   Agents worked  for Allstate\n\npursuant to an Agent  Compensation Agreement until  Allstate,\n\ndiscouraged  by its  inability  to turn  a  profit under  the\n\nMassachusetts  insurance  regime,  ceased  doing business  in\n\nMassachusetts in 1989.\n\n          In September  1990, seventy-six1 of  the plaintiffs\n\nfiled a suit against Allstate alleging, inter alia, breach of\n                                                  \n\nthe   implied  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing.\n\nAllstate moved for summary judgment on two occasions, and the\n\ndistrict court granted both motions.2       \n\n                    \n\n1.  The remaining three  plaintiffs were added with  leave of\nthe court on November 25, 1991 and January 16, 1992.\n\n2.  Allstate's  first motion  for  summary judgment,  against\nfive of the  Agents, was granted in segments  by the district\ncourt in oral  rulings on June 9, 1992 and February 10, 1993,\nand  in a February  19, 1993,  written decision.   Allstate's\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nB.  Jurisdictional Chaos\n                        \n\n          The  appellate jurisdictional  woes  of the  Agents\n\nbegan when they subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\nInstead of naming all seventy-nine Agents, the caption in the\n\nnotice of  appeal merely  listed the  appellants as  \"William\n\nGochis,  et.  al.\"     The  appealing  Agents   were  further\n\nidentified  in  the  body  of  the  notice  as  \"all  of  the\n\nplaintiffs in the above-entitled action.\"  \n\n          Agents' counsel was notified by  the Clerk's Office\n\nthat,  under Fed.  R.  App.  P. 3(c),3  the  notice could  be\n\ndeemed defective as to all  plaintiffs other than Gochis.  In\n\nresponse  to this notification, because the thirty-day period\n\nfor  filing a notice of appeal under  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)\n\nhad elapsed, Agents' counsel filed with the district  court a\n\nFed.  R. App.  P.  4(a)(5)4  motion to  extend  the time  for\n\n                    \n\nsecond   motion  for  summary  judgment,  against  the  other\nseventy-four Agents, was granted by the district court in  an\noral decision on April 8, 1993.\n\n3.  Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)  states, inter alia, that the notice\n                                            \nof  appeal \"shall  specify  the party  or parties  taking the\n                          \nappeal.\" (emphasis supplied).   We note that Fed.  R. App. P.\n3(c)  has been amended effective  December 1, 1993.  However,\nsince  neither  party  has raised  the  applicability  of the\nrevised  rule, we have  not considered the  amendment in this\nappeal.\n\n4.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) states in relevant part that:\n\n          The  district   court,  upon   a  showing   of\n     excusable  neglect  or good  cause, may  extend the\n     time  for filing  a notice  of  appeal upon  motion\n     filed not later  than 30 days after  the expiration\n     of the  time prescribed  by this Rule  4(a). .  . .\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nfiling  a new notice  of appeal.   By margin order,  and over\n\nAllstate's  objection,   the  district   court  granted   the\n\nextension.  A  new notice of  appeal naming all  seventy-nine\n\nAgents  was then  filed and  docketed.   Thereafter,  Agents'\n\ncounsel  voluntarily filed  a motion  to  withdraw the  first\n\nnotice of appeal.  We granted this motion in June 1993.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, Allstate claims that  the district court\n\nerred in granting Agents' motion to extend the time to file a\n\nnew  notice of appeal.5  More specifically, Allstate contends\n\nthat the district court erred in determining that the  Agents\n\nadequately demonstrated  excusable neglect as  required under\n\nFed.  R. App.  P.  4(a)(5).   Agents, in  response, primarily\n\nargue that the district court's grant of their motion was not\n\nin error and, therefore, that  this appeal should proceed  as\n\n                    \n\n     [N]o  such extension shall exceed 30 days past such\n     prescribed  time or 10 days  from the date of entry\n     of the order granting the  motion, whichever occurs\n     later.\n\n5.  We  note that  Allstate incorrectly  assumes  that if  we\nreverse  the district  court's ruling,  this  appeal will  be\ndismissed as  to seventy-eight  of the  Agents only,  leaving\nGochis' appeal intact.  However, because the second notice of\nappeal was filed  after the time prescribed by  Rule 4(a)(1),\nand because the  first notice was voluntarily  withdrawn, the\nappeals of all seventy-nine Agents, including  Gochis, depend\n                                  \nupon the viability of the second notice of appeal. \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nto all seventy-nine Agents.  We think Allstate has the better\n\nargument.6 \n\nA.  Standard of Review \nA.  Standard of Review\n                      \n\n          Our review of a district court's interpretation  of\n                                                         \n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) is plenary.  Pontarelli v. Stone, 930\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 104,  109 (1st Cir.  1991).  Where the  district court's\n\ngrant of plaintiff's  motion to extend time for  filing a new\n\nnotice of appeal is  by margin order and, therefore,  without\n\nany interpretation of  the rule, however, we  will ordinarily\n\nreview its decision to grant a Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) motion\n\nfor abuse of  discretion.  See generally id.;  cf. Ramseur v.\n                                                          \n\nBeyer, 921 F.2d 504, 506 n.2. (3d Cir. 1990).\n     \n\nB.  Excusable Neglect under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).\n                                                    \n\n          As  noted above,  under Fed.  R.  App. P.  4(a)(1),\n\nnotices of appeal in civil cases must be filed \"30 days after\n\nthe date of entry of the judgment . . . appealed from.\"  Fed.\n\nR.  App. P.  4(a)(5)  provides  a  narrow  exception  whereby\n\ndelinquent parties may be granted up to an additional 30 days\n\nby the district court.  To avail oneself of the exception, in\n\n                    \n\n6.  Agents also contend that Allstate waived its challenge to\nthe district court's ruling by  filing its objection 50  days\nafter  the district court's order was issued, and, therefore,\n20 days after  the time prescribed by Rule  4(a)(1).  Because\nour  jurisdiction depends upon  the validity of  the district\ncourt's decision, however, we  are not bound by  this alleged\nprocedural   default.    Instead,  as  always,  we  have  \"an\nobligation  to inquire sua  sponte into [our]  subject matter\n                                  \njurisdiction,  and to proceed no further if such jurisdiction\nis wanting.\"  See In re  Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d  1000,\n                                            \n1002 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ncircumstances  where  the  need for  the  extension  \"results\n\nentirely   from  neglect   attributable   to  appellant,   as\n\ndistinguished from forces beyond her control,  appellant must\n\nshow excusable neglect.\"  Pontarelli, 930 F.2d at 109.  As we\n                                    \n\nhave  often stated,  in  order  to  show  excusable  neglect,\n\nappellant   must   demonstrate    unique   or   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.  See, e.g., id.  at 104; Rivera v. Puerto Rico\n                                                             \n\nTel. Co., 921 F.2d 393, 396 (1st Cir. 1990).  We find no such\n        \n\ncircumstances here.\n\n          Agents, in their motion, explained to  the district\n\ncourt that their tardiness was caused by a misapprehension of\n\nFed.  R.  App.  P.  3(c)'s  specificity  requirement.    This\n\nmisapprehension,  in turn, was  given two explanations:   (1)\n\nthe   \"names  of   the   plaintiffs   were  omitted   through\n\ninadvertence of counsel\";  and (2) counsel's failure  to name\n\nthe  defendants  was  the  result   of  counsel's  \"plausible\n\nmisconstruction\" of the requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 3(c).\n\nNeither explanation is sufficient to meet the Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(5) standard.\n\n          In  Rivera,  we  explicitly  held  that   counsel's\n                    \n\nmistaken or  inadvertent failure to name the  appellants in a\n\nnotice of appeal  \"does not constitute excusable  neglect for\n\npurposes of  Fed.  R.  App.  P. 4(a)(5)\"  absent  unusual  or\n\nextraordinary  circumstances.    Rivera,  921  F.2d  at  396.\n                                       \n\nAgents   argue    that   the   \"unusual    or   extraordinary\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ncircumstances\" in this  case consist of their  own \"plausible\n\nmisconstruction\" of the requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 3(c).\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Although   we  do   not  completely   discount  the\n\npossibility  that a  \"plausible  misconstruction\" of  Federal\n\nRules  may,  in  some situations,  meet  the  requirements of\n\nexcusable  neglect under  Fed. R.  App.  P. 4(a)(5),  Agents'\n\ncounsel's \"misconstruction\"  of the  requirements of  Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 3(c) can hardly  be considered \"plausible.\"  As noted\n\nabove, Fed. R.  App. P. 3(c) requires that a notice of appeal\n\n\"specify\"  the \"parties  taking the  appeal.\"   In 1987,  the\n\nSupreme Court stated that \"specify\" means \"name.\"  Torres  v.\n                                                         \n\nOakland  Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 314 (1987)(\"The failure\n                      \n\nto name a  party in a notice of appeal is more than excusable\n       \n\n`informality';  it constitutes  a failure  of  that party  to\n\nappeal.\")(emphasis supplied).   Moreover, we  repeatedly have\n\nheld that  we lack jurisdiction over unnamed appellants.  See\n                                                             \n\nRivera, 921  F.2d at 395;  Rosario-Torres v.

In  the case of In  re San Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel\n                                                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nFire  Litig., 888  F.2d 940  (1st Cir.  1989), we  upheld the\n            \n\ndistrict court's  grant of a  Fed. R. App. P.  4(a)(5) motion\n\nwhere the initial  notice of appeal  simply stated that  \"all\n\nplaintiffs, through the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee hearby\n\n[sic] appeal.\"   Id. at 941.  We found the district court did\n                    \n\nnot abuse its discretion by granting the Plaintiffs' Steering\n\nCommittee, (\"PSC\"),  a team  of trial  attorneys representing\n\nover 2000 plaintiffs, a Fed.  R.

It took thirty-nine  pages to list the  appellants in the\nnew notice of appeal.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nthe thirty-day appeal period.  Moreover, the court found that\n\ncounsel's interpretation  of the  rule had  been induced,  in\n\npart,  by a confusing  motion submitted by  opposing counsel.\n\nAgain,  we  have no  such  circumstances  before us.    Here,\n\ncounsel's \"misinterpretation\" of Fed. R. App. P. 3(c) was due\n\nto   nothing  more  than  counsel's  ignorance  of  the  law,\n\nsomething  the Lorezen  court viewed  as inexcusable  neglect\n                                                    \n\nunder  Fed.

The Dispute\n               \n\n          This case involves  a compensation dispute  between\n\nplaintiffs, seventy-nine former Massachusetts insurance sales\n\nagents  (\"Agents\"), and  their  employer, defendant  Allstate\n\nInsurance Company (\"Allstate\").   Agents worked  for Allstate\n\npursuant to an Agent  Compensation Agreement until  Allstate,\n\ndiscouraged  by its  inability  to turn  a  profit under  the\n\nMassachusetts  insurance  regime,  ceased  doing business  in\n\nMassachusetts in 1989.\n\n          In September  1990, seventy-six1 of  the plaintiffs\n\nfiled a suit against Allstate alleging, inter alia, breach of\n                                                  \n\nthe   implied  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing.\n\nAllstate moved for summary judgment on two occasions, and the\n\ndistrict court granted both motions.2       \n\n                    \n\n1.  The remaining three  plaintiffs were added with  leave of\nthe court on November 25, 1991 and January 16, 1992.\n\n2.  Allstate's  first motion  for  summary judgment,  against\nfive of the  Agents, was granted in segments  by the district\ncourt in oral  rulings on June 9, 1992 and February 10, 1993,\nand  in a February  19, 1993,  written decision.   Allstate's\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nB.  Jurisdictional Chaos\n                        \n\n          The  appellate jurisdictional  woes  of the  Agents\n\nbegan when they subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\nInstead of naming all seventy-nine Agents, the caption in the\n\nnotice of  appeal merely  listed the  appellants as  \"William\n\nGochis,  et.  al.\"     The  appealing  Agents   were  further\n\nidentified  in  the  body  of  the  notice  as  \"all  of  the\n\nplaintiffs in the above-entitled action.\"  \n\n          Agents' counsel was notified by  the Clerk's Office\n\nthat,  under Fed.  R.  App.  P. 3(c),3  the  notice could  be\n\ndeemed defective as to all  plaintiffs other than Gochis.  In\n\nresponse  to this notification, because the thirty-day period\n\nfor  filing a notice of appeal under  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)\n\nhad elapsed, Agents' counsel filed with the district  court a\n\nFed.  R. App.  P.  4(a)(5)4  motion to  extend  the time  for\n\n                    \n\nsecond   motion  for  summary  judgment,  against  the  other\nseventy-four Agents, was granted by the district court in  an\noral decision on April 8, 1993.\n\n3.  Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)  states, inter alia, that the notice\n                                            \nof  appeal \"shall  specify  the party  or parties  taking the\n                          \nappeal.\" (emphasis supplied).   We note that Fed.  R. App. P.\n3(c)  has been amended effective  December 1, 1993.  However,\nsince  neither  party  has raised  the  applicability  of the\nrevised  rule, we have  not considered the  amendment in this\nappeal.\n\n4.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) states in relevant part that:\n\n          The  district   court,  upon   a  showing   of\n     excusable  neglect  or good  cause, may  extend the\n     time  for filing  a notice  of  appeal upon  motion\n     filed not later  than 30 days after  the expiration\n     of the  time prescribed  by this Rule  4(a). .  . .\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nfiling  a new notice  of appeal.   By margin order,  and over\n\nAllstate's  objection,   the  district   court  granted   the\n\nextension.  A  new notice of  appeal naming all  seventy-nine\n\nAgents  was then  filed and  docketed.   Thereafter,  Agents'\n\ncounsel  voluntarily filed  a motion  to  withdraw the  first\n\nnotice of appeal.  We granted this motion in June 1993.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, Allstate claims that  the district court\n\nerred in granting Agents' motion to extend the time to file a\n\nnew  notice of appeal.5  More specifically, Allstate contends\n\nthat the district court erred in determining that the  Agents\n\nadequately demonstrated  excusable neglect as  required under\n\nFed.  R. App.  P.  4(a)(5).   Agents, in  response, primarily\n\nargue that the district court's grant of their motion was not\n\nin error and, therefore, that  this appeal should proceed  as\n\n                    \n\n     [N]o  such extension shall exceed 30 days past such\n     prescribed  time or 10 days  from the date of entry\n     of the order granting the  motion, whichever occurs\n     later.\n\n5.  We  note that  Allstate incorrectly  assumes  that if  we\nreverse  the district  court's ruling,  this  appeal will  be\ndismissed as  to seventy-eight  of the  Agents only,  leaving\nGochis' appeal intact.  However, because the second notice of\nappeal was filed  after the time prescribed by  Rule 4(a)(1),\nand because the  first notice was voluntarily  withdrawn, the\nappeals of all seventy-nine Agents, including  Gochis, depend\n                                  \nupon the viability of the second notice of appeal. \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nto all seventy-nine Agents.  We think Allstate has the better\n\nargument.6 \n\nA.  Standard of Review \nA.

We find no such\n        \n\ncircumstances here.\n\n          Agents, in their motion, explained to  the district\n\ncourt that their tardiness was caused by a misapprehension of\n\nFed.  R.  App.  P.  3(c)'s  specificity  requirement.    This\n\nmisapprehension,  in turn, was  given two explanations:   (1)\n\nthe   \"names  of   the   plaintiffs   were  omitted   through\n\ninadvertence of counsel\";  and (2) counsel's failure  to name\n\nthe  defendants  was  the  result   of  counsel's  \"plausible\n\nmisconstruction\" of the requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 3(c).\n\nNeither explanation is sufficient to meet the Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(5) standard.\n\n          In  Rivera,  we  explicitly  held  that   counsel's\n                    \n\nmistaken or  inadvertent failure to name the  appellants in a\n\nnotice of appeal  \"does not constitute excusable  neglect for\n\npurposes of  Fed.
