The district court, finding  that no such\n\nduty existed, granted a  post-judgment motion for judgment as\n\na  matter  of  law  in  favor  of  defendant  American  Title\n\nInsurance Co.  (\"American\"), thus  nullifying a  jury verdict\n\nawarding $286,000 in  negligence damages  to plaintiff  Focus\n\nInvestment  Associates, Inc. (\"Focus\").1   Focus appeals that\n\nruling,  as  well  as  others  related   to  it.    American,\n\nmeanwhile,  argues that  the jury's  $49,000 damage  award on\n\nFocus's  contract claim  may  have  resulted  from  erroneous\n\ninstructions  and  should  therefore  be vacated.    For  the\n\nreasons that  follow, we  affirm the judgments  against Focus\n\nand vacate the judgment against American.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  See generally  Focus Inv. Assocs. v.  American Title Ins.\n                                                             \nCo., 797 F. Supp. 109 (D.R.I. 1992).\n   \n\n2.  Prior to trial, Fed. R. Civ.  P. Rule 50 had already been\namended to abolish the  different designations between a pre-\njudgment \"motion  for directed verdict\"  and a  post-judgment\n\"motion  for judgment n.o.v.\"  Both motions are  now known as\n\"motions for judgment as a matter of law.\"  As the applicable\nstandards under the two denominations do not differ, we will,\nfor purposes of consistency, refer to the motions at issue as\nthough they were submitted  and ruled upon under  the amended\nRule.  See Davet v. Maccarone,  973 F.2d 22, 26 n.4 (1st Cir.\n                             \n1992) (discussing amendment to federal rule and  substituting\nappropriate nomenclature).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                       Background Facts\n                                       \n\n          Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are\n\nundisputed.    Focus,   a  family-owned  and   operated  Ohio\n\ncorporation,  invests money  from  a family  trust and  makes\n\nloans  secured by interests in  real estate.   On December 6,\n\n1988, Laurence  J. Shapiro, a now-deceased  Boston-based real\n\nestate   developer  and  mortgage   broker,  contacted  Focus\n\nPresident Edward  Sarbey3 to solicit placement  of a $250,000\n\nshort-term  loan  to  George  Marderosian,  a  Rhode   Island\n\nattorney.    Shapiro  explained  that  Marderosian  was  lead\n\nattorney in  a real estate enterprise,  which urgently needed\n\nto fund  operational cash  shortfalls.  Shapiro  indicated to\n\nFocus that  Guardian Mortgage  Corp., a loan  company Shapiro\n\noperated,  would make and close the loan, and then assign all\n\nloan documents to  Focus, in return  for Focus's funding  and\n\npurchase of the loan.\n\n          Shapiro represented to Focus that the loan would be\n\nfully secured by second mortgages on twelve condominium units\n\nvalued at $1.14 million,  subject only to Attleboro Pawtucket\n\nSavings   Bank's  (\"Attleboro\")   first   mortgage  with   an\n\n                    \n\n3.  Shapiro and  Sarbey became  acquainted when the  two were\nneighbors in  Boston, prior  to Sarbey's relocation  to Ohio.\nAccording  to  Sarbey, Shapiro  originally  recommended loans\nsecured by  real estate as  a safe and  profitable investment\nidea.   Prior to the loan here at issue, Shapiro had arranged\nseveral other loans for Focus.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\napproximate  balance  of $720,000.   As  additional security,\n\nFocus  was to  be given  a  second mortgage  on Marderosian's\n\nhome, which,  according to  Shapiro, had  an equity  value of\n\n$100,000 to  $150,000 over and above The  Boston Five Corp.'s\n\nfirst mortgage.   Finally, Shapiro and  Marderosian agreed to\n\npersonally guarantee  the loan, and  to assign  to Focus  the\n\nproceeds of  a consulting agreement between  Shapiro and Dean\n\nStreet  Development, a  Marderosian client.   Based  on these\n\nrepresentations, Focus agreed to purchase and fund the loan.\n\n           Shapiro  hired defendant James Tobak, an associate\n\nof  defendant law  firm Abrams  and  Verri, to  represent the\n\nlender's  interests4 and close the loan deal.  On December 6,\n\n1988,  Tobak   transmitted  to   Sarbey  facsimiles   of  the\n\npromissory  notes,  mortgages,  and  guarantees  executed  in\n\nconnection with the loan.  The following day,  Tobak informed\n\nSarbey  that Focus's  mortgages  had been  recorded and  that\n\ntitle insurance had been obtained.  He  then requested Sarbey\n\nto  wire  the  loan proceeds  to  Abrams  and  Verri's escrow\n\naccount, which Sarbey did  the same day.    The loan  closing\n\ntook  place December 8,  1988.  The terms  of the loan called\n\nfor  an annual  interest  rate of  20  percent, with  monthly\n\n                    \n\n4.  Focus  claims  that  Tobak   was  hired  to  protect  its\ninterests,  while  Tobak  claims  he  was  hired  to  protect\nShapiro's and Guardian's interests.  We address this dispute-\n-which  turns on  the identity  of the  actual \"lender\"--more\nfully infra at 15.\n           \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ninterest payments of $4,166.67  to begin on January  6, 1989.\n\nFinal repayment was due on April 6, 1989.\n\n          Among the loan documents, Focus received two  title\n\ninsurance  policies  issued   by  American's   policy-issuing\n\nattorney, defendant  Owen Landman.  The  first policy insured\n\nFocus's second mortgage on 12 condominium units.   The policy\n\nshowed title to the units to be vested in the  name of George\n\nA.  Marderosian, Trustee  of the  River's Edge  Realty Trust.\n\nExcepted  from coverage  under the  first policy was  a first\n\nmortgage with a  principal balance of  $720,000.  The  second\n\npolicy insured Focus's second mortgage on Marderosian's home,\n\nexcepting  a  first  mortgage  in  the  principal  amount  of\n\n$150,000.\n\n          Near the  end of December  1988, Shapiro died.   In\n\nJanuary, February and  March 1989, Marderosian made  payments\n\nto  Focus totalling  $23,200.   However, as  of the  April 6,\n\n1988, due date, the balance of the principal and the interest\n\ndue under the terms  of the promissory note remained  unpaid.\n\nIn the  course of  considering its response  to Marderosian's\n\nnon-payment,  Focus discovered  that  its  mortgages did  not\n\noccupy  a  second  position   on  either  of  the  collateral\n\nproperties.   With respect to the  condominium units, Focus's\n\nmortgage  was  in  fifth   position.    Focus's  mortgage  on\n\nMarderosian's home  was in fourth  position, behind mortgages\n\nheld by C &amp; K Investments ($100,000) and Bank of New England-\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nOld Colony ($50,000), as  well as the first mortgage  held by\n\nBoston  Five Corp.  In addition, at the time Focus's mortgage\n\nwas recorded,  title to the  condominium units was  vested in\n\nCapital Center Development, not  Marderosian.  Neither of the\n\ntitle  insurance policies  reflected  the  existence  of  the\n\nsenior mortgages  nor did the condominium  policy reflect the\n\nactual ownership.\n\n          The  title  insurance  policies  in  question  were\n\nissued by defendant Landman, whom American had appointed as a\n\npolicy-issuing attorney  in April 1980.   Landman, who shared\n\noffice  space with Marderosian, was listed as \"Of Counsel\" on\n\nthe Marderosian law firm  letterhead.  Landman testified that\n\nhe issued the  title policies at  Marderosian's request.   He\n\nconducted no independent title  search, but instead relied on\n\nMarderosian's  representations   as  to  the   ownership  and\n\nmortgage status of the collateral properties.\n\n          In July 1989, Attleboro foreclosed its mortgage  on\n\nthe  condominium  units.    The foreclosure  sale  price  was\n\n$220,000  less than  the  balance  of  Attleboro's  mortgage,\n\nleaving nothing for a  second mortgagee.  Shortly thereafter,\n\nMarderosian's  home  was  bid  in at  foreclosure  by  second\n\nmortgagee C &amp; K Investments, which assumed liability for  the\n\nprincipal  balance  of  $150,000  remaining  on  Boston  Five\n\nCorp.'s first mortgage and paid an additional $49,000,  for a\n\ntotal purchase price  of $199,000.  Thus, $49,000 in proceeds\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nremained  after  satisfaction   of  the  Boston  Five   Corp.\n\nmortgage.\n\n          On  November  11,  1989,  Focus  filed  a diversity\n\naction  against  American, Landman,  Tobak,  Abrams &amp;  Verri,\n\nShapiro's estate,  and Marderosian.  The nine-count complaint\n\nsought  damages  from  American   for  breach  of  the  title\n\ninsurance  contract, negligence in searching title, negligent\n\nhiring,  retention  and  supervision  of  Landman,  negligent\n\nmisrepresentation of Focus's mortgage position, and bad faith\n\nrefusal to settle.   Focus accused  Landman of negligence  in\n\nsearching title and  negligent misrepresentation.   Tobak and\n\nAbrams &amp; Verri were charged with negligent misrepresentation,\n\nlegal malpractice, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.    Finally,  Focus   sought  to  enforce  the  personal\n\nguaranties  tendered by  Shapiro and  Marderosian.   Prior to\n\ntrial, Marderosian filed  a motion to dismiss, to which Focus\n\ndid not object, apparently  because it thought Marderosian to\n\nbe  judgment-free.   The district  court granted  the motion,\n\nwith prejudice. \n\n     At trial,  Focus  argued that  the  terms of  the  title\n\ninsurance  contract  obligated  American  to  pay  Focus  the\n\n$49,000  that would  have  been  available  to Focus  had  it\n\nactually been  the  second mortgage  holder on  Marderosian's\n\nhome.    In  addition,  Focus  sought  to  recover  the  loan\n\nproceeds, plus costs  and interest from  defendants American,\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nLandman,  Tobak,  et  al.,  theorizing  that  but  for  their\n                         \n\ntortious conduct,  Focus never  would have made  the loan  to\n\nMarderosian.  \n\n          At  the close  of Focus's  case-in-chief, American,\n\nLandman,  Tobak, and Abrams &amp;  Verri moved for  judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.   The court reserved decision on  the motions.\n\nThe  defendants renewed their motions at the close of all the\n\nevidence.   Focus also moved for judgment  as a matter of law\n\non American's affirmative defense of usury.  The court denied\n\nFocus's  motion  and  reserved  decision on  the  motions  of\n\nAmerican and Landman.  The court granted the motions of Tobak\n\nand Abrams  &amp; Verri, ruling  that Focus's failure  to present\n\nexpert testimony  with respect  to an attorney's  standard of\n\ncare under the relevant circumstances  was fatal to the claim\n\nof legal malpractice.\n\n          The jury found American liable on both contract and\n\nnegligence grounds, awarding damages of $49,000 and $286,000,\n\nrespectively.   The  jury also  found Landman  negligent, but\n\nawarded  no damages.    Following trial,  American moved  for\n\njudgment  as a  matter  of  law  on  both  the  contract  and\n\nnegligence counts.  The  district court, ruling that American\n\nowed  Focus no duty with respect to the title search, granted\n\nthe motion on the negligence  count, while denying the motion\n\non  the contract  claim.   On  June  18, 1992,  judgment  was\n\nentered in accordance with these rulings.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          Both  Focus  and American  appealed.   Focus claims\n\nthat judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  was  improper  because\n\nAmerican  was under a duty  to Focus to  perform a reasonable\n\ntitle search.   Focus  also  argues that  the district  court\n\nincorrectly ruled  that expert testimony was  necessary on an\n\nattorney's standard of care, and that even if  such testimony\n\nwas required, it  was supplied via the testimony of attorneys\n\nTobak and Marderosian.  American  appeals on the ground  that\n\nthe district court incorrectly charged the jury that it \"may\"\n\nreturn  a  verdict  for American  if  it  found  the loan  to\n\nMarderosian usurious,  when in  actuality a finding  of usury\n\nwould mean that a jury \"must\" rule in favor of American.5  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                        Focus's Appeal\n                                      \n\nA.  Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                               \n\n          The bulk of Focus's appeal is aimed at the district\n\ncourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law against Focus on\n\nits  various claims of negligence.   In reviewing  a grant of\n\njudgment  as a matter of law, the evidence and all reasonable\n\n                    \n\n5.  Focus   also  argued   that  American   should  be   held\nvicariously liable  for the negligence of  its alleged agent,\nLandman.   The  district court  ruled  that Landman  was  not\nAmerican's agent,  and Focus  appeals that decision  as well.\nThe  only asserted  basis  for Landman's  negligence was  his\nfailure to  independently search  title prior to  issuing the\npolicies in question.   Because,  as will  be explained  more\nfully, infra, we find that a title insurer owes no duty to an\n            \ninsured with respect to  a title search, we need  not resolve\nthe agency issue.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ninferences  therefrom  must be  examined  in  the light  most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant.  Lowe v. Scott, 959 F.2d 323, 337\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).  Judgment as  a matter of law is appropriate\n\nonly  when the evidence, so viewed, is such that a reasonable\n\njury could reach only one conclusion.  Id.   \n                                          \n\nB. The Negligence Claims6\n                        \n\n     1.  The Title Search\n                         \n\n          Focus essentially argues, as  it did at trial, that\n\nAmerican--via  its   agent,  Landman--failed  to   conduct  a\n\nreasonable title search prior  to issuing the title insurance\n\npolicy  to  Focus.   Had  American  done  so, and  thereafter\n\ndisclosed to  Focus the correct number  of superior mortgages\n\non the proffered collateral, Focus claims it never would have\n\nmade the loan to Marderosian.   At the heart of this argument\n\nis the question of  whether a title insurance company  can be\n\nheld liable for  failure to search  title and disclose  title\n\ndefects to its insured.  This is apparently an issue of first\n\n                    \n\n6.  We note that the jury was not given separate instructions\nrelative   to  each  of  Focus's  negligence  claims  against\nAmerican--e.g.,    searching    title,     misrepresentation,\nsupervision, etc.--but instead was given a verdict form which\nasked only, \"Do you find American Title liable for negligence\nin issuing the title insurance policies?\"  Therefore, because\nthe record  does not  indicate which  theory the  jury relied\nupon to  make  its $286,000  negligence award,  we, like  the\ndistrict court,  must examine each theory  individually.

In each  of those cases,  however, the title\n\ninsurance company  either had  expressly agreed to  provide a\n\ntitle report or had issued to the insured a preliminary title\n\nreport which failed to disclose a title defect which was then\n\nexcluded from coverage under the policy.  In such situations,\n\n          two distinct responsibilities are  assumed [by\n          the insurer]; in rendering the  first service,\n          the insurer  serves as an abstractor  of title\n          and must  list all  matters  of public  record\n          regarding   the   subject   property  in   its\n          preliminary  report.

See Greenberg, 492 N.W.2d at 150. \n                       \n\n9.  To  the extent,  therefore,  that Focus  claims that  the\nexistence  of a  duty was  a question for  the jury,  such an\nargument is legally incorrect.

Negligent Misrepresentation\n                                    \n\n          As  we  have  said,  each of  the  title  insurance\n\npolicies here at issue excepted  from coverage only one prior\n\nmortgage,  thereby   insuring  Focus's  position   as  second\n\nmortgagee  on  both  the condominium  units  and  Marderosian\n\nresidence.  Focus argues that the policies therefore amounted\n\nto a false representation  that its mortgages were in  second\n\nposition,   which  representation   was  due   to  American's\n\nnegligence.  Consequently, Focus argues, because it relied on\n\nthese  representations  in  deciding  to  make  the  loan  to\n\nMarderosian,  American is  liable for  Marderosian's default.\n\nAlthough we agree with the district court that American, as a\n\nmatter  of  law,  was  not  liable  to  Focus  for  negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, our reasoning  differs somewhat from  that\n\nof the district court.   See Banco Popular de Puerto  Rico v.\n                                                          \n\nGreenblatt, 964  F.2d 1227,  1230 (1st Cir.  1992) (appellate\n          \n\ncourt can  affirm a judgment on  any independently sufficient\n\nground reflected in the record).\n\n          We  have  stated  that   \"[t]itle  insurance  is  a\n\ncontract of indemnity, not guarantee.\"  Falmouth Nat.

Moreover, a title insurer  \"does not\n\nguarantee either  that the  mortgaged premises are  worth the\n\namount  of the  mortgage or  that the  mortgage debt  will be\n\nrepaid.\"  Blackhawk Prod. Credit Assoc. v. Chicago Title Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 423 N.W.2d 521, 525 (Wis. 1988) (citations omitted).  As\n   \n\nthe  title insurance  policies  issued by  American were  not\n\nrepresentations of  title, they cannot,  as a matter  of law,\n\nform the basis of a claim of negligent misrepresentation.10\n\n                    \n\n10.  Not only  are the district  court's decisions  regarding\nthe title insurance  policies in accord  with those of  other\njurisdictions, they are supported  by logic as well.   In our\nview, Focus's  position  is tantamount  to  a buyer  of  life\ninsurance  claiming that  his policy  is a  guarantee against\ndeath.    Focus's  claim  that it  relied  on  the  insurance\npolicies  as  evidence  that no  undisclosed  superior  liens\nexisted  simply  flies  in the  face  of  the  fact that  the\npolicies were issued to  protect Focus against losses it  may\nsuffer   from  undisclosed  superior  liens.    Moreover,  an\ninsured's losses are limited to situations where the security\nof  the insured lien is actually  impaired by the undisclosed\nsuperior lien.  \"The  mere fact of an undisclosed  prior lien\nis  insufficient to establish this  claim; a showing that the\nprior lien renders  the insured lien `insecure'  must be made\nas  well.\"    Blackhawk,  423  N.W.2d  at  525-26.  (citation\n                       \nomitted).   In other words, if  the lien held  by Focus would\nhave  been  valueless  without  the undisclosed  lien,  Focus\ncannot  claim any loss due to the presence of the undisclosed\nlien.    This explains  the  jury's $49,000  award  under the\ncontract, because between the two collateral properties, only\nthat  amount--left  over from  the  foreclosure  sale of  the\nMarderosian residence--would have been  available to Focus as\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n     3.  Negligent Hiring, Retention and Supervision\n                                                    \n\n       In addition to claims of negligence in searching title\n\nand  negligent  misrepresentation,  Focus asserted  at  trial\n\nclaims   directly  against  American  for  negligent  hiring,\n\nretention  and supervision  of its  policy-issuing attorneys,\n\nLandman and  Marderosian.  The  district court found  none of\n\nthese theories to be legally supportable.  We agree.\n\n          Rhode   Island  law   does  recognize   the  direct\n\nliability of  an employer to third parties for damages caused\n\nby employees or agents who were negligently hired, trained or\n\nsupervised.  Welsh Mfg., 474 A.2d  at 438.  This liability is\n                       \n\nbased  on a failure to exercise reasonable care in hiring and\n\nretaining a person who  the employer knows or should  know is\n\nunfit for the job, and who therefore exposes third parties to\n\nunreasonable risks of  harm.  Id.  at 440.   With respect  to\n                                 \n\nAmerican's selection  and retention  of Landman as  a policy-\n\n                    \n\na second mortgagee.  With respect to the rest of  the loan to\nMarderosian, Focus was simply  insufficiently collateralized.\nIn making this  last statement, we reject  Focus's claim that\nAmerican's negligence  resulted in a confused  state of title\nthat \"chilled\" the foreclosure  sales and thereby reduced the\nequity  available  to a  second  mortgagee.   Although  Focus\npresented  expert  evidence  at  trial  indicating  that  the\ncollateral  properties  had  a  market  value  exceeding  the\nforeclosure sale price, those experts testified that although\nforeclosure  itself would  reduce a property's  market value,\nthey  did not consider the  effects of a  foreclosure sale on\nthe  value  of the  property at  issue  in arriving  at their\nappraisal.    Finally,  there   was  no  explanation  of  how\nAmerican's  alleged  negligence--as opposed  to Marderosian's\nactions--created   the   title  confusion,   the  foreclosure\nsituation or the resulting depressed value.  \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nissuing attorney,  however, the record is  devoid of evidence\n\nthat  American knew  or should  have  known that  Landman was\n\nunfit  for the position.  Nor was any evidence presented that\n\nLandman  exhibited  any job-related  deficiencies  during the\n\nnine-year period  he served  American.  Accordingly,  we find\n\nFocus's negligent  hiring and retention claims  to be legally\n\ninsufficient.\n\n          Focus next argues  that American's failure to  give\n\nLandman personal  instructions  or training  with respect  to\n\ntitle  insurance  or  title  searching,  failure  to  conduct\n\nseminars  or courses,  and  failure to  audit Landman's  work\n\nconstituted negligence  and resulted  in Focus's loss  on the\n\nMarderosian  loan.    As  we have  stated  already,  however,\n\nAmerican  was under  no duty  to provide  Focus with  a title\n\nreport,  and  any  title  search  undertaken  by  Landman  or\n\nAmerican was for  American's benefit, not Focus's.  Thus, any\n\nfailure on American's part to train Landman is not actionable\n\nby Focus.  \n\n          Finally,   to  support   its  claim   of  negligent\n\nsupervision,  Focus  argues that  if  American  had a  system\n\nwhereby it could have ascertained which property interests it\n\nalready insured,  it would  have discovered the  senior liens\n\nnot disclosed on the policies  issued to Focus, since earlier\n\npolicies on  the same properties  showed additional different\n\nencumbrances.  Focus's  argument fails, however,  because, as\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nAmerican  correctly  points  out,  title policies  issued  at\n\ndifferent times  may show different encumbrances  on the same\n\nproperty  simply because  the  encumbrances may  have changed\n\nover time due to refinancing or discharge.  Therefore,  Focus\n\nhas failed to indicate how such a cross-checking system would\n\nhave yielded any relevant information.\n\n          In  the  end,  with   respect  to  all  of  Focus's\n\nnegligence claims, Focus received what it bargained  for -- a\n\ntitle insurance policy which  promised to indemnify Focus for\n\nany  losses suffered as a result of Focus not having a second\n\nmortgage  on the relevant collateral properties.  As the only\n\nequity available to  a second mortgagee was  $49,000 from the\n\nforeclosure  of  the  Marderosian  residence,  that  was  the\n\n\"actual loss\"  within the  meaning of  the policy,  see supra\n                                                             \n\nnote  7,  and thus  the only  loss  American was  required to\n\nindemnify.   Focus was not  legally entitled to anything else\n\nfrom American.\n\nC.  Legal Malpractice\n                     \n\n          The district court granted  judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw in favor of Tobak and Abrams &amp;  Verri, holding that Focus\n\nneeded to present  expert testimony to the  jury with respect\n\nto the duty of care owed  by an attorney in Tobak's position.\n\nFocus first argues that no such expert testimony was required\n\nbecause the standard of care of an attorney  \"in representing\n\na  lender\" is  within a  layman's common  knowledge.   In the\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nalternative, Focus  argues that  the jury was  presented with\n\nsuch  evidence  via  the  testimony  or cross-examination  of\n\nTobak, Landman  and Marderosian.  After  careful analysis, we\n\nare unpersuaded by Focus's contentions.  \n\n          As an initial matter, we  note that in arguing that\n\nno expert testimony was required relative to the duty owed by\n\na lender's attorney, Focus has, in our view, misapprehended a\n          \n\ncritical concern of the district court.   In granting Tobak's\n\nmotion,  the  court   emphasized  the  confusion  surrounding\n\nTobak's  actual  role in  the  loan process,  and  found that\n\nFocus's failure to present  evidence which would have clearly\n\nestablished Tobak's  role was  a serious  matter, as  was its\n\nfailure to  present evidence  indicating exactly what  is the\n\nstandard of care for an attorney performing that role.11\n\n                    \n\n11.  Specifically, the district court stated:\n\n          My  understanding is that the argument is\n          that  Mr. Tobac  (sic) allegedly  gave an\n          opinion upon which  the Plaintiff  relied\n          that  each of  the mortgages  in question\n          were  second  mortgages.    There  is  an\n          underlying factual issue here  of whether\n          or not in the first  place the defendant,\n          Tobac  (sic),  and   his  law  firm  were\n          engaged  for the purpose  of providing an\n          opinion with respect to the effect of the\n          two mortgages.  I'm  satisfied . . . that\n          this  is  a  circumstance  in  which it's\n          necessary to have  available to the  jury\n          expert opinion  with respect to  the duty\n          of  an  attorney  in  Mr.  Tobac's  (sic)\n          situation.   Particularly in light of the\n          fact  that his  situation  is unclear  to\n          begin with as to just exactly what he was\n          hired to do.  What his engagement was.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n     1.  The Need for Expert Testimony\n                                      \n\n          It  is well settled  under Rhode Island  law that a\n\nlegal malpractice plaintiff must  prove the \"want of ordinary\n\ncare and skill\"  by the defendant.   Holmes v.  Peck, 1  R.I.\n                                                    \n\n242, 245  (1849).   While there is  no Rhode Island  case law\n\naddressing  the   issue  of  expert  testimony   in  a  legal\n\nmalpractice case,  a review of other  jurisdictions indicates\n\nthat  the  most  widely  accepted   rule  is  that  a   legal\n\nmalpractice   plaintiff   must   present   expert   testimony\n\nestablishing  the appropriate  standard  of care  unless  the\n\nattorney's  lack of  care and  skill is  so obvious  that the\n\ntrier of  fact can resolve  the issue as  a matter  of common\n\nknowledge.

Cases which  fall  into  the \"common  knowledge\"\n\ncategory  are  those  where  the  negligence  is  \"clear  and\n\npalpable,\"  or  where  no  analysis  of  legal  expertise  is\n\ninvolved.  See   e.g.,  Collins v.

He testified that\n\nnothing  he reviewed indicated to  him that the  loan was not\n\nproceeding as planned.  Sarbey also testified that it was his\n\nunderstanding that Tobak  was representing \"the  lender,\" but\n\nbecause, in his opinion, Focus was the lender, Sarbey thought\n\nthat Tobak was representing Focus.  Essentially, Focus argues\n\nthat Tobak was employed by Focus and committed malpractice by\n\nrelying  on the  documentation  he was  presented and  simply\n\nreviewing it without making an independent investigation.  In\n\nour view, regardless of who Tobak  represented, Focus's claim\n\nclearly implicates  the issue  of Tobak's application  of his\n\nlegal  expertise to  the situation.

Accordingly,  we  find that  the district  court\n\ndecided  correctly  that  expert  testimony  was  required to\n\nestablish the standard of  care applicable to an attorney  in\n\nTobak's position.\n\n     2.  Trial Testimony as Expert Testimony \n     2.

Thus, even assuming that\n\nthe testimony of the three defendants did adduce the  claimed\n\nstandards, the jury could only speculate as to which standard\n\napplied to Tobak. See Lenius, 294 N.W.2d at 914 (jury may not\n                            \n\nbe  permitted to  speculate  as to  standard of  professional\n\nconduct).   Given  the parties'  dispute over  the employment\n\nissue, we believe that the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat  the  jury should  have  been  presented with  testimony\n\nconcerning the role assumed by--and concomitant duties of--an\n\nattorney  in Tobak's position; that is, hired by a party who,\n\non paper, is the lender,  but in reality is a  broker through\n\nwhom  the loan proceeds will  pass.  Because  Focus failed to\n\nclear  that hurdle, we need  not address the  adequacy of the\n\ntestimony that  was introduced  at trial. Instead,  given the\n                   \n\nfactual and legal landscape, we find that  the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded  that expert  testimony on the  nature of\n\nTobak's  role was  both required  and lacking,  and therefore\n\nproperly  granted judgment  as a  matter of  law in  favor of\n\nTobak and Abrams &amp; Verri.12\n\n                    \n\n12.  Focus  argues  for the  first  time on  appeal  that the\ndistrict  court  erred  because if  the  jury  had  found for\nAmerican  on its  usury  claim, then  Tobak  would have  been\nliable  to  Focus  for  failing  to   apprise  Focus  of  the\nillegality.    We  do  not  reach  this  issue,  but  instead\nreiterate  our familiar  position  that arguments  not raised\nbefore  the district court \"cannot  be surfaced for the first\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                      American's Appeal\n                                       \n\nA.  Usury\n         \n\n          Under Rhode Island law, loans which call for annual\n\ninterest  payments in  excess  of 21  percent are  considered\n\nusurious,  and are  therefore void  and uncollectible.   R.I.\n\nGen.  Laws      6-26-2,  6-26-4  (1956)  (1992  Reenactment);\n\nDeFusco  v. Giorgio, 440 A.2d  727, 731-32 (R.I.  1982).  The\n                   \n\nresult is the same whether or not the lender intended to make\n\na  usurious loan.   In  re Swartz, 37  B.R. 776  (Bankr. R.I.\n                                 \n\n1984).   Here, there is  no dispute that  the promissory note\n\ngiven  to  Guardian  by  Marderosian and  assigned  to  Focus\n\nprovided for  20 percent  annual interest.   American claims,\n\nhowever,  that Shapiro's  assignment  to Focus  of a  $56,500\n\nconsulting fee  paid to Shapiro by  Marderosian's client Dean\n\nStreet    Development--an     assignment    which    occurred\n\ncontemporaneously  with  the  Marderosian   loan  agreement--\n\nconstituted  a  separate,  hidden  interest  payment  on  the\n\nMarderosian loan, bringing the actual annual interest rate on\n\nthe loan to 88 percent.\n\n          According to American's theory,  as a result of the\n\nusurious--and  therefore  void--mortgage,  Focus   failed  to\n\nacquire an insurable property interest and therefore suffered\n\n                    \n\ntime on appeal.\"   Goldman v. First National Bank  of Boston,\n                                                            \nNo. 92-1773, slip op. at 5, n.4 (Feb. 18, 1993).\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nno damage  as a result  of any title  defects.   The district\n\ncourt denied Focus's motion  for judgment as a matter  of law\n\nwith respect  to usury, and  allowed the  issue to go  to the\n\njury, giving the following instruction in the context of  the\n\ncontract claim:\n\n               Defendant  contends   that  payments\n          under a consulting agreement  executed at\n          the same time as  the loan agreement were\n          in reality interest payments on the loan.\n          If  you  find by  a preponderance  of the\n          evidence  that  the consulting  agreement\n          was  really a pretext  for the payment of\n          an illegal rate of interest, then you may\n                                                   \n          find  that  the  loan  was  unlawful  and\n          return  a verdict  for  Defendant on  the\n          contract claim. \n\n(Emphasis added).  American timely objected, arguing that the\n\nuse of the word \"may\" impermissibly gave the jury  discretion\n\nto find for Focus even  if it found the loan to  be usurious.\n\nThe court  did  not  change  the instruction,  and  the  jury\n\nawarded  Focus  $49,000  under  the  title  insurance  policy\n\ncovering  the mortgage  on  Marderosian's home.   On  appeal,\n\nAmerican  claims that  the  \"may\" instruction  was clear  and\n\nharmful error entitling  it to  a new trial.   After  careful\n\nreview, we agree.\n\n          Interestingly, Focus does  not directly dispute the\n\ncentral thesis of American's  appeal--the failure of the jury\n\ninstruction  to conform to the law  of usury as it relates to\n\ninsurable  interests.     Instead,  Focus   argues  that  (1)\n\nAmerican,  or  anyone else  other  than  the borrower,  lacks\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nstanding to raise the  usury defense; (2) American  failed to\n\nestablish  a  prima  facie case  of  usury;  and,  (3) it  is\n\n\"obvious\" that the jury found that the loan was not usurious,\n\ntherefore  rendering  any error  harmless.    Finding all  of\n\nFocus's arguments unpersuasive, we address each in turn.\n\n     1.  Standing\n                 \n\n          It is  ordinarily true, as Focus  asserts, that the\n\ndefense  of usury  is  personal to  the  borrower or  one  in\n\nprivity with  the borrower,  and unavailable to  strangers to\n\nthe  usurious  transaction. See  generally,  45  Am.

See DeFusco, 440 A.2d at 732 (although Rhode Island\n                     \n\nusury  laws  manifest strong  public policy  against usurious\n\ntransactions,  \"we  do  not  believe  that   the  Legislature\n\nintended thereby to preclude a debtor from  waiving a defense\n\nof usury under all circumstances\").

In  each of  these cases,\n\nhowever, the  party asserting the usury  claim was attempting\n\nto  avoid  repayment  of  a debt,  and  was  prohibited  from\n\ninterposing  the claim.  See,  e.g., Pinnix, 200  S.E. at 879\n                                           \n\n(\"to allow a  stranger to interpose the defense of usury to a\n\ncontract  with which the maker is  in all respects satisfied,\n\nand by the terms of which he desires to abide, and upon which\n\nhe is liable for a deficiency judgment,  would be exceedingly\n\nunfair to a debtor who  desires to perform his contract. .  .\n\n.\").  Unlike  the usury  theorists in  those cases,  however,\n\nAmerican  is not  attempting to  step into  the shoes  of the\n\nborrower,  Marderosian,  and  void  the loan.    Rather  than\n\nasserting  usury as  a  defense  to  repayment of  the  loan,\n\nAmerican  instead  argues that  the  usurious  nature of  the\n\nMarderosian   loan   rendered   Focus's   mortgage   interest\n\nuninsurable.  Indeed, there appears to be no dispute that had\n\nFocus  not acquiesced  to  Marderosian's motion  to  dismiss,\n\nMarderosian  would have  had the  right to interpose  a usury\n\ndefense.   Thus,  while American's  claim does  implicate the\n\nquestion  of usury, Focus's  \"personal defense\" theory--while\n\naccurate--is, in  our view, misplaced.   Accordingly, we turn\n\nto the substance of American's argument.\n\n          \"In order for recovery  [on an insurance policy] to\n\nbe  had, it  is  essential that  the  claimant show  both  an\n\nexisting contract  of insurance and an  insurable interest in\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nthe property.   No insurable interest  existing, the contract\n\nis considered absolutely void . . . \"  4 John A. Appleman and\n\nJean  Appleman, Insurance  Law  and Practice,    2121  (1969)\n                                            \n\n(footnotes omitted);  Cronin v. Vermont Life Ins.

In  what is  apparently the only  case to\n\naddress the  issue, the Minnesota  Supreme Court held  that a\n\nusurious mortgage cannot give  rise to an insurable interest.\n\nPhalen Park  State  Bank v.  Reeves, 251  N.W.2d 135,  138-39\n                                   \n\n(Minn.  1977).   Phalen  was a  mortgagee's  suit on  a  fire\n                       \n\ninsurance policy.  The court accepted the insurance company's\n\nargument  that   the  bank,   by  charging  interest   on  an\n\nundisbursed  portion  of  the  loan,  effectively  charged  a\n\nusurious  rate  of  interest.    The  Phalen  court  used two\n                                            \n\nseparate analytical  paths to  reach its conclusion,  both of\n\nwhich  are applicable here and inevitably lead us to the same\n\ndetermination.\n\n          First, Phalen  restated the general  rule that  one\n                       \n\nhas an  insurable interest in  property \"by the  existence of\n\nwhich  he will gain advantage, or by the destruction of which\n\nhe  will suffer a  loss.\"  Id.  at 139 (quoting  Harrison  v.\n                                                          \n\nFortlage, 161 U.S. 57, 65  (1896)); see also Appleman, supra,\n                                                            \n\n   2123,  2188.   Because,  however, a  usurious mortgage  is\n\nvoid, and the  mortgagee, therefore, has no  right to collect\n\nprincipal  or interest, no loss will occur if the property is\n\ndestroyed.  Id.          The  second  rationale  employed  by\n               \n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\nPhalen  follows from the premise  that where a  state views a\n      \n\nparticular legal scheme as reflecting the highest concern for\n\npublic welfare, strict adherence to that scheme applies, even\n\nin  collateral  matters.    Thus, given  that  the  Minnesota\n\nLegislature  declared usurious  transactions to  be  void, an\n\nobvious  expression of  high public  welfare concern,  Phalen\n                                                             \n\nheld  that no insurable interest  could arise from a usurious\n\nmortgage. Id.  The Phalen  court relied in part on   Mackie &amp;\n                                                             \n\nWilliams Food Stores, Inc.  v.

Id.  See  also,  Cherokee\n                                                             \n\nFoundries,  Inc. v.  Imperial Assurance  Co., 219  S.W.2d 203\n                                            \n\n(Tenn. 1949) (purchaser of real property pursuant  to an oral\n\nsales contract  did not  acquire  insurable interest  because\n\ncontract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds).\n\n          Here, under either approach,  a finding of usury in\n\nthe   Marderosian-Focus  transaction   would   lead  to   the\n\ninexorable conclusion that the mortgages received by Focus as\n\ncollateral were  not insurable  interests.   As to  the first\n\ntheory, as  we have already noted,  usurious transactions are\n\nvoid under  Rhode Island law.   Thus,  if the loan  is indeed\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nusurious,  Marderosian could  legally  avoid  repayment,  and\n\nrecoup any  sums already paid.   Cf. Keenan v.  Coppa, 195 A.\n                                                     \n\n485 (R.I.  1937).  Therefore,  because a usurious  loan would\n\nleave  Focus with  no enforceable right  in the  mortgages at\n\nissue, a jury finding of  usury would necessarily leave Focus\n\nwith no insurable interest. \n\n          As  to  Phalen's  second  path,  the  Rhode  Island\n                          \n\nSupreme Court  has  unequivocally acknowledged  that  state's\n\nstrong  public  policy  against  usurious  transactions.  See\n                                                             \n\nDeFusco, 440 A.2d  at 732.   Therefore, if Focus's  mortgages\n       \n\nwere acquired through a  usurious transaction, violative of a\n\nstrong public policy, that public policy would apply to other\n\nmatters.   Under  those  circumstances, Focus  would have  no\n\ninsurable interest.   Accord Bankers  &amp; Shippers Ins.

Focus\n                              \n\ncounters by arguing that Phalen is, by its own terms, limited\n                               \n\nto  its  facts,   and  that  a  later  Minnesota   case  both\n\ndistinguished and  minimized the  importance of Phalen.   See\n                                                             \n\nMidwest Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n  v. West Bend Mut. Ins.

We are unpersuaded. \n\n          It is  true, as Focus  points out, that  the Phalen\n                                                             \n\nmajority concluded its opinion  by stating: \"[W]e stress that\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nour  holding has resulted from  and is limited  to the unique\n\nfacts  and circumstances presented in  this case.   We do not\n\nintend  by this decision to  depart from the  general rule in\n\nthis  state  that the  defense of  usury  is personal  to the\n\nborrower.\"    Id. at  141.    Nowhere, however,  does  Phalen\n                                                             \n\nindicate   what  \"unique   facts   and  circumstances\"   were\n\npresented.    Irrespective   of  this  qualifying   language,\n\nhowever,  Phalen's  holding   remains  inescapable--that   no\n                  \n\ninsurable  interest can  arise  out of  a usurious  mortgage.\n\nMoreover,  as   we  previously  noted,   the  \"general  rule\"\n\nregarding usury is inapposite to this case, where American is\n\nnot asserting a usury  defense, as such. Finally, even  if we\n\nwere   to   accept  Focus's   argument   concerning  Phalen's\n                                                             \n\nlimitations, we note that Phalen's conclusion with respect to\n                                  \n\nusury  was but  a  small part  of  a broader  inquiry;  i.e.,\n\nwhether  an insurable  interest can  arise out  of a  void or\n\nunenforceable contract.   The answer generally  appears to be\n\nnegative.   See  supra  pp. 27-29.    Nor does  Midwest  help\n                                                       \n\nFocus's cause.  In Midwest, the  court precluded an insurance\n                          \n\ncompany  from asserting  a usury  defense in  an action  by a\n\nmortgagee seeking recovery under a fire policy.  Although the\n\ncourt  cited  Phalen for  the  \"general  rule\" regarding  the\n                    \n\npersonal nature of the usury defense, Id. at 695, the court's\n                                         \n\ndecision--and that  of the trial  court, see id.  at 695--was\n                                                \n\nbased on a Minnesota statute which precluded all corporations\n                                                             \n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\nfrom invoking a usury  defense. Id.  Notably,  the \"insurable\n                                   \n\ninterest\" aspect  of Phalen  was never addressed  in Midwest,\n                                                            \n\nmuch less limited  or distinguished.  Finally,  to the extent\n\nthat Midwest can be  construed to run counter to  Phalen, the\n                                                        \n\nlatter  remains  the  pronouncement  of  Minnesota's  highest\n\ncourt.   Based on the foregoing, we find that American could,\n\nunder these circumstances, properly raise its usury argument.\n\n     2.  Prima Facie Case\n                         \n\n          To support its claim of usury, American argues that\n\nShapiro's assignment  of rights under  a consulting agreement\n\nwith  Dean Street Development  constituted hidden, additional\n\ninterest,  apart from  the  20 percent  rate  charged in  the\n\nMarderosian  loan documents.   Under  American's theory,  the\n\nactual  interest rate  was  88 percent.    Focus responds  by\n\nrelying on the apparent separateness  between Marderosian and\n\nthe parties to  the consulting fee.  Implicitly, the district\n\ncourt rejected Focus's prima facie argument, as it denied its\n\nmotion for directed verdict on the usury issue.  We reject it\n\nas  well.    In  short, Focus's  argument  ignores  authority\n\nholding that\n\n           \"[u]sury is not  determined merely  from\n          what    the    parties   represent    the\n          transaction  to  be, but  the  court will\n          look  to  the   whole  transaction,   the\n          surrounding       circumstances,      the\n          occurrences  at  the time  of  making the\n          agreement,  and  the  instruments  drawn.\n          Whether  a transaction legal  on its face\n          is, in  fact, merely  a  device to  cover\n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\n          usury generally is a question of fact for\n          the jury.\" \n\n45 Am. Jur.  2d Interest  and Usury    112 (1969) (and  cases\n                                   \n\ncited therein) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          Here, there is evidence that the loan proceeds were\n\nintended for Dean Street Development, a Marderosian client in\n\nneed  of \"discreet\" funding and there is no question that the\n\nassignment from  Shapiro to Focus  was finalized at  the same\n\ntime as the loan from Focus to Marderosian.  Finally, the sum\n\npayable under the assignment  were due to be repaid  April 6,\n\n1989, the same  day as the loan.  Focus  argues that the loan\n\nand   assignment   were   entirely   separate   transactions,\n\ncharacterizing  the assignment as  nothing more  than Shapiro\n\nsharing his  broker's commission with  Focus, a  non-usurious\n\ntransaction.   While the jury, of course, is entirely free to\n\naccept  either version of the  facts, it is  quite clear that\n\nAmerican has at least made out a prima facie case of usury.\n\n     3.  The Instruction\n                        \n\n          As the  above discussion makes clear,  if, in fact,\n\nthe jury were to find the loan to Marderosian usurious, then,\n\nas a matter of law, Focus would have no insurable interest in\n\nthe  collateral mortgages.  Therefore, the instruction, which\n\nused the  permissive \"may,\"  allowed for  both  a finding  of\n                                              \n\nusury and a verdict  for Focus on  its contract claim.   This\n\n                             -35-\n                              35\n\nwas  error.13   Accordingly,  American is  entitled to  a new\n\ntrial   on  Focus's  contract   claim,  accompanied   by  the\n\nappropriate instruction on usury.  \n\n                             IV.\n                                \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          For the  reasons stated herein, the  judgment below\n\nis  vacated insofar  as it  awarded damages  to Focus  on its\n    vacated\n           \n\ncontract claim, and affirmed in all other respects.\n                    affirmed\n                            \n\n                    \n\n13.  We find  nothing in the  record to support  Focus's bald\nassertion  that the error was harmless because \"it is obvious\nthat the jury found that the loan was not usurious.\"\n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n",

(\"Focus\").1   Focus appeals that\n\nruling,  as  well  as  others  related   to  it.    American,\n\nmeanwhile,  argues that  the jury's  $49,000 damage  award on\n\nFocus's  contract claim  may  have  resulted  from  erroneous\n\ninstructions  and  should  therefore  be vacated.

Focus,   a  family-owned  and   operated  Ohio\n\ncorporation,  invests money  from  a family  trust and  makes\n\nloans  secured by interests in  real estate.   On December 6,\n\n1988, Laurence  J. Shapiro, a now-deceased  Boston-based real\n\nestate   developer  and  mortgage   broker,  contacted  Focus\n\nPresident Edward  Sarbey3 to solicit placement  of a $250,000\n\nshort-term  loan  to  George  Marderosian,  a  Rhode   Island\n\nattorney.    Shapiro  explained  that  Marderosian  was  lead\n\nattorney in  a real estate enterprise,  which urgently needed\n\nto fund  operational cash  shortfalls.  Shapiro  indicated to\n\nFocus that  Guardian Mortgage  Corp., a loan  company Shapiro\n\noperated,  would make and close the loan, and then assign all\n\nloan documents to  Focus, in return  for Focus's funding  and\n\npurchase of the loan.\n\n          Shapiro represented to Focus that the loan would be\n\nfully secured by second mortgages on twelve condominium units\n\nvalued at $1.14 million,  subject only to Attleboro Pawtucket\n\nSavings   Bank's  (\"Attleboro\")   first   mortgage  with   an\n\n                    \n\n3.  Shapiro and  Sarbey became  acquainted when the  two were\nneighbors in  Boston, prior  to Sarbey's relocation  to Ohio.\nAccording  to  Sarbey, Shapiro  originally  recommended loans\nsecured by  real estate as  a safe and  profitable investment\nidea.   Prior to the loan here at issue, Shapiro had arranged\nseveral other loans for Focus.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\napproximate  balance  of $720,000.   As  additional security,\n\nFocus  was to  be given  a  second mortgage  on Marderosian's\n\nhome, which,  according to  Shapiro, had  an equity  value of\n\n$100,000 to  $150,000 over and above The  Boston Five Corp.'s\n\nfirst mortgage.   Finally, Shapiro and  Marderosian agreed to\n\npersonally guarantee  the loan, and  to assign  to Focus  the\n\nproceeds of  a consulting agreement between  Shapiro and Dean\n\nStreet  Development, a  Marderosian client.   Based  on these\n\nrepresentations, Focus agreed to purchase and fund the loan.\n\n           Shapiro  hired defendant James Tobak, an associate\n\nof  defendant law  firm Abrams  and  Verri, to  represent the\n\nlender's  interests4 and close the loan deal.  On December 6,\n\n1988,  Tobak   transmitted  to   Sarbey  facsimiles   of  the\n\npromissory  notes,  mortgages,  and  guarantees  executed  in\n\nconnection with the loan.  The following day,  Tobak informed\n\nSarbey  that Focus's  mortgages  had been  recorded and  that\n\ntitle insurance had been obtained.  He  then requested Sarbey\n\nto  wire  the  loan proceeds  to  Abrams  and  Verri's escrow\n\naccount, which Sarbey did  the same day.    The loan  closing\n\ntook  place December 8,  1988.  The terms  of the loan called\n\nfor  an annual  interest  rate of  20  percent, with  monthly\n\n                    \n\n4.  Focus  claims  that  Tobak   was  hired  to  protect  its\ninterests,  while  Tobak  claims  he  was  hired  to  protect\nShapiro's and Guardian's interests.  We address this dispute-\n-which  turns on  the identity  of the  actual \"lender\"--more\nfully infra at 15.\n           \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ninterest payments of $4,166.67  to begin on January  6, 1989.\n\nFinal repayment was due on April 6, 1989.\n\n          Among the loan documents, Focus received two  title\n\ninsurance  policies  issued   by  American's   policy-issuing\n\nattorney, defendant  Owen Landman.  The  first policy insured\n\nFocus's second mortgage on 12 condominium units.   The policy\n\nshowed title to the units to be vested in the  name of George\n\nA.  Marderosian, Trustee  of the  River's Edge  Realty Trust.\n\nExcepted  from coverage  under the  first policy was  a first\n\nmortgage with a  principal balance of  $720,000.  The  second\n\npolicy insured Focus's second mortgage on Marderosian's home,\n\nexcepting  a  first  mortgage  in  the  principal  amount  of\n\n$150,000.\n\n          Near the  end of December  1988, Shapiro died.   In\n\nJanuary, February and  March 1989, Marderosian made  payments\n\nto  Focus totalling  $23,200.   However, as  of the  April 6,\n\n1988, due date, the balance of the principal and the interest\n\ndue under the terms  of the promissory note remained  unpaid.\n\nIn the  course of  considering its response  to Marderosian's\n\nnon-payment,  Focus discovered  that  its  mortgages did  not\n\noccupy  a  second  position   on  either  of  the  collateral\n\nproperties.   With respect to the  condominium units, Focus's\n\nmortgage  was  in  fifth   position.    Focus's  mortgage  on\n\nMarderosian's home  was in fourth  position, behind mortgages\n\nheld by C &amp; K Investments ($100,000) and Bank of New England-\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nOld Colony ($50,000), as  well as the first mortgage  held by\n\nBoston  Five Corp.  In addition, at the time Focus's mortgage\n\nwas recorded,  title to the  condominium units was  vested in\n\nCapital Center Development, not  Marderosian.  Neither of the\n\ntitle  insurance policies  reflected  the  existence  of  the\n\nsenior mortgages  nor did the condominium  policy reflect the\n\nactual ownership.\n\n          The  title  insurance  policies  in  question  were\n\nissued by defendant Landman, whom American had appointed as a\n\npolicy-issuing attorney  in April 1980.   Landman, who shared\n\noffice  space with Marderosian, was listed as \"Of Counsel\" on\n\nthe Marderosian law firm  letterhead.  Landman testified that\n\nhe issued the  title policies at  Marderosian's request.   He\n\nconducted no independent title  search, but instead relied on\n\nMarderosian's  representations   as  to  the   ownership  and\n\nmortgage status of the collateral properties.\n\n          In July 1989, Attleboro foreclosed its mortgage  on\n\nthe  condominium  units.    The foreclosure  sale  price  was\n\n$220,000  less than  the  balance  of  Attleboro's  mortgage,\n\nleaving nothing for a  second mortgagee.  Shortly thereafter,\n\nMarderosian's  home  was  bid  in at  foreclosure  by  second\n\nmortgagee C &amp; K Investments, which assumed liability for  the\n\nprincipal  balance  of  $150,000  remaining  on  Boston  Five\n\nCorp.'s first mortgage and paid an additional $49,000,  for a\n\ntotal purchase price  of $199,000.  Thus, $49,000 in proceeds\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nremained  after  satisfaction   of  the  Boston  Five   Corp.\n\nmortgage.\n\n          On  November  11,  1989,  Focus  filed  a diversity\n\naction  against  American, Landman,  Tobak,  Abrams &amp;  Verri,\n\nShapiro's estate,  and Marderosian.  The nine-count complaint\n\nsought  damages  from  American   for  breach  of  the  title\n\ninsurance  contract, negligence in searching title, negligent\n\nhiring,  retention  and  supervision  of  Landman,  negligent\n\nmisrepresentation of Focus's mortgage position, and bad faith\n\nrefusal to settle.   Focus accused  Landman of negligence  in\n\nsearching title and  negligent misrepresentation.   Tobak and\n\nAbrams &amp; Verri were charged with negligent misrepresentation,\n\nlegal malpractice, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.    Finally,  Focus   sought  to  enforce  the  personal\n\nguaranties  tendered by  Shapiro and  Marderosian.   Prior to\n\ntrial, Marderosian filed  a motion to dismiss, to which Focus\n\ndid not object, apparently  because it thought Marderosian to\n\nbe  judgment-free.   The district  court granted  the motion,\n\nwith prejudice. \n\n     At trial,  Focus  argued that  the  terms of  the  title\n\ninsurance  contract  obligated  American  to  pay  Focus  the\n\n$49,000  that would  have  been  available  to Focus  had  it\n\nactually been  the  second mortgage  holder on  Marderosian's\n\nhome.    In  addition,  Focus  sought  to  recover  the  loan\n\nproceeds, plus costs  and interest from  defendants American,\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nLandman,  Tobak,  et  al.,  theorizing  that  but  for  their\n                         \n\ntortious conduct,  Focus never  would have made  the loan  to\n\nMarderosian.  \n\n          At  the close  of Focus's  case-in-chief, American,\n\nLandman,  Tobak, and Abrams &amp;  Verri moved for  judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.   The court reserved decision on  the motions.\n\nThe  defendants renewed their motions at the close of all the\n\nevidence.   Focus also moved for judgment  as a matter of law\n\non American's affirmative defense of usury.  The court denied\n\nFocus's  motion  and  reserved  decision on  the  motions  of\n\nAmerican and Landman.  The court granted the motions of Tobak\n\nand Abrams  &amp; Verri, ruling  that Focus's failure  to present\n\nexpert testimony  with respect  to an attorney's  standard of\n\ncare under the relevant circumstances  was fatal to the claim\n\nof legal malpractice.\n\n          The jury found American liable on both contract and\n\nnegligence grounds, awarding damages of $49,000 and $286,000,\n\nrespectively.   The  jury also  found Landman  negligent, but\n\nawarded  no damages.    Following trial,  American moved  for\n\njudgment  as a  matter  of  law  on  both  the  contract  and\n\nnegligence counts.  The  district court, ruling that American\n\nowed  Focus no duty with respect to the title search, granted\n\nthe motion on the negligence  count, while denying the motion\n\non  the contract  claim.   On  June  18, 1992,  judgment  was\n\nentered in accordance with these rulings.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          Both  Focus  and American  appealed.   Focus claims\n\nthat judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  was  improper  because\n\nAmerican  was under a duty  to Focus to  perform a reasonable\n\ntitle search.   Focus  also  argues that  the district  court\n\nincorrectly ruled  that expert testimony was  necessary on an\n\nattorney's standard of care, and that even if  such testimony\n\nwas required, it  was supplied via the testimony of attorneys\n\nTobak and Marderosian.  American  appeals on the ground  that\n\nthe district court incorrectly charged the jury that it \"may\"\n\nreturn  a  verdict  for American  if  it  found  the loan  to\n\nMarderosian usurious,  when in  actuality a finding  of usury\n\nwould mean that a jury \"must\" rule in favor of American.5  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                        Focus's Appeal\n                                      \n\nA.  Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                               \n\n          The bulk of Focus's appeal is aimed at the district\n\ncourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law against Focus on\n\nits  various claims of negligence.   In reviewing  a grant of\n\njudgment  as a matter of law, the evidence and all reasonable\n\n                    \n\n5.  Focus   also  argued   that  American   should  be   held\nvicariously liable  for the negligence of  its alleged agent,\nLandman.   The  district court  ruled  that Landman  was  not\nAmerican's agent,  and Focus  appeals that decision  as well.\nThe  only asserted  basis  for Landman's  negligence was  his\nfailure to  independently search  title prior to  issuing the\npolicies in question.   Because,  as will  be explained  more\nfully, infra, we find that a title insurer owes no duty to an\n            \ninsured with respect to  a title search, we need  not resolve\nthe agency issue.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ninferences  therefrom  must be  examined  in  the light  most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant.

The Title Search\n                         \n\n          Focus essentially argues, as  it did at trial, that\n\nAmerican--via  its   agent,  Landman--failed  to   conduct  a\n\nreasonable title search prior  to issuing the title insurance\n\npolicy  to  Focus.   Had  American  done  so, and  thereafter\n\ndisclosed to  Focus the correct number  of superior mortgages\n\non the proffered collateral, Focus claims it never would have\n\nmade the loan to Marderosian.   At the heart of this argument\n\nis the question of  whether a title insurance company  can be\n\nheld liable for  failure to search  title and disclose  title\n\ndefects to its insured.  This is apparently an issue of first\n\n                    \n\n6.  We note that the jury was not given separate instructions\nrelative   to  each  of  Focus's  negligence  claims  against\nAmerican--e.g.,    searching    title,     misrepresentation,\nsupervision, etc.--but instead was given a verdict form which\nasked only, \"Do you find American Title liable for negligence\nin issuing the title insurance policies?\"  Therefore, because\nthe record  does not  indicate which  theory the  jury relied\nupon to  make  its $286,000  negligence award,  we, like  the\ndistrict court,  must examine each theory  individually.

Negligent Misrepresentation\n                                    \n\n          As  we  have  said,  each of  the  title  insurance\n\npolicies here at issue excepted  from coverage only one prior\n\nmortgage,  thereby   insuring  Focus's  position   as  second\n\nmortgagee  on  both  the condominium  units  and  Marderosian\n\nresidence.  Focus argues that the policies therefore amounted\n\nto a false representation  that its mortgages were in  second\n\nposition,   which  representation   was  due   to  American's\n\nnegligence.  Consequently, Focus argues, because it relied on\n\nthese  representations  in  deciding  to  make  the  loan  to\n\nMarderosian,  American is  liable for  Marderosian's default.\n\nAlthough we agree with the district court that American, as a\n\nmatter  of  law,  was  not  liable  to  Focus  for  negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, our reasoning  differs somewhat from  that\n\nof the district court.

As\n   \n\nthe  title insurance  policies  issued by  American were  not\n\nrepresentations of  title, they cannot,  as a matter  of law,\n\nform the basis of a claim of negligent misrepresentation.10\n\n                    \n\n10.  Not only  are the district  court's decisions  regarding\nthe title insurance  policies in accord  with those of  other\njurisdictions, they are supported  by logic as well.   In our\nview, Focus's  position  is tantamount  to  a buyer  of  life\ninsurance  claiming that  his policy  is a  guarantee against\ndeath.    Focus's  claim  that it  relied  on  the  insurance\npolicies  as  evidence  that no  undisclosed  superior  liens\nexisted  simply  flies  in the  face  of  the  fact that  the\npolicies were issued to  protect Focus against losses it  may\nsuffer   from  undisclosed  superior  liens.    Moreover,  an\ninsured's losses are limited to situations where the security\nof  the insured lien is actually  impaired by the undisclosed\nsuperior lien.  \"The  mere fact of an undisclosed  prior lien\nis  insufficient to establish this  claim; a showing that the\nprior lien renders  the insured lien `insecure'  must be made\nas  well.\"    Blackhawk,  423  N.W.2d  at  525-26.  (citation\n                       \nomitted).   In other words, if  the lien held  by Focus would\nhave  been  valueless  without  the undisclosed  lien,  Focus\ncannot  claim any loss due to the presence of the undisclosed\nlien.    This explains  the  jury's $49,000  award  under the\ncontract, because between the two collateral properties, only\nthat  amount--left  over from  the  foreclosure  sale of  the\nMarderosian residence--would have been  available to Focus as\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n     3.  Negligent Hiring, Retention and Supervision\n                                                    \n\n       In addition to claims of negligence in searching title\n\nand  negligent  misrepresentation,  Focus asserted  at  trial\n\nclaims   directly  against  American  for  negligent  hiring,\n\nretention  and supervision  of its  policy-issuing attorneys,\n\nLandman and  Marderosian.  The  district court found  none of\n\nthese theories to be legally supportable.  We agree.\n\n          Rhode   Island  law   does  recognize   the  direct\n\nliability of  an employer to third parties for damages caused\n\nby employees or agents who were negligently hired, trained or\n\nsupervised.  Welsh Mfg., 474 A.2d  at 438.  This liability is\n                       \n\nbased  on a failure to exercise reasonable care in hiring and\n\nretaining a person who  the employer knows or should  know is\n\nunfit for the job, and who therefore exposes third parties to\n\nunreasonable risks of  harm.  Id.  at 440.   With respect  to\n                                 \n\nAmerican's selection  and retention  of Landman as  a policy-\n\n                    \n\na second mortgagee.  With respect to the rest of  the loan to\nMarderosian, Focus was simply  insufficiently collateralized.\nIn making this  last statement, we reject  Focus's claim that\nAmerican's negligence  resulted in a confused  state of title\nthat \"chilled\" the foreclosure  sales and thereby reduced the\nequity  available  to a  second  mortgagee.   Although  Focus\npresented  expert  evidence  at  trial  indicating  that  the\ncollateral  properties  had  a  market  value  exceeding  the\nforeclosure sale price, those experts testified that although\nforeclosure  itself would  reduce a property's  market value,\nthey  did not consider the  effects of a  foreclosure sale on\nthe  value  of the  property at  issue  in arriving  at their\nappraisal.    Finally,  there   was  no  explanation  of  how\nAmerican's  alleged  negligence--as opposed  to Marderosian's\nactions--created   the   title  confusion,   the  foreclosure\nsituation or the resulting depressed value.  \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nissuing attorney,  however, the record is  devoid of evidence\n\nthat  American knew  or should  have  known that  Landman was\n\nunfit  for the position.  Nor was any evidence presented that\n\nLandman  exhibited  any job-related  deficiencies  during the\n\nnine-year period  he served  American.  Accordingly,  we find\n\nFocus's negligent  hiring and retention claims  to be legally\n\ninsufficient.\n\n          Focus next argues  that American's failure to  give\n\nLandman personal  instructions  or training  with respect  to\n\ntitle  insurance  or  title  searching,  failure  to  conduct\n\nseminars  or courses,  and  failure to  audit Landman's  work\n\nconstituted negligence  and resulted  in Focus's loss  on the\n\nMarderosian  loan.    As  we have  stated  already,  however,\n\nAmerican  was under  no duty  to provide  Focus with  a title\n\nreport,  and  any  title  search  undertaken  by  Landman  or\n\nAmerican was for  American's benefit, not Focus's.  Thus, any\n\nfailure on American's part to train Landman is not actionable\n\nby Focus.  \n\n          Finally,   to  support   its  claim   of  negligent\n\nsupervision,  Focus  argues that  if  American  had a  system\n\nwhereby it could have ascertained which property interests it\n\nalready insured,  it would  have discovered the  senior liens\n\nnot disclosed on the policies  issued to Focus, since earlier\n\npolicies on  the same properties  showed additional different\n\nencumbrances.  Focus's  argument fails, however,  because, as\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nAmerican  correctly  points  out,  title policies  issued  at\n\ndifferent times  may show different encumbrances  on the same\n\nproperty  simply because  the  encumbrances may  have changed\n\nover time due to refinancing or discharge.  Therefore,  Focus\n\nhas failed to indicate how such a cross-checking system would\n\nhave yielded any relevant information.\n\n          In  the  end,  with   respect  to  all  of  Focus's\n\nnegligence claims, Focus received what it bargained  for -- a\n\ntitle insurance policy which  promised to indemnify Focus for\n\nany  losses suffered as a result of Focus not having a second\n\nmortgage  on the relevant collateral properties.  As the only\n\nequity available to  a second mortgagee was  $49,000 from the\n\nforeclosure  of  the  Marderosian  residence,  that  was  the\n\n\"actual loss\"  within the  meaning of  the policy,  see supra\n                                                             \n\nnote  7,  and thus  the only  loss  American was  required to\n\nindemnify.   Focus was not  legally entitled to anything else\n\nfrom American.\n\nC.  Legal Malpractice\n                     \n\n          The district court granted  judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw in favor of Tobak and Abrams &amp;  Verri, holding that Focus\n\nneeded to present  expert testimony to the  jury with respect\n\nto the duty of care owed  by an attorney in Tobak's position.\n\nFocus first argues that no such expert testimony was required\n\nbecause the standard of care of an attorney  \"in representing\n\na  lender\" is  within a  layman's common  knowledge.   In the\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nalternative, Focus  argues that  the jury was  presented with\n\nsuch  evidence  via  the  testimony  or cross-examination  of\n\nTobak, Landman  and Marderosian.  After  careful analysis, we\n\nare unpersuaded by Focus's contentions.  \n\n          As an initial matter, we  note that in arguing that\n\nno expert testimony was required relative to the duty owed by\n\na lender's attorney, Focus has, in our view, misapprehended a\n          \n\ncritical concern of the district court.   In granting Tobak's\n\nmotion,  the  court   emphasized  the  confusion  surrounding\n\nTobak's  actual  role in  the  loan process,  and  found that\n\nFocus's failure to present  evidence which would have clearly\n\nestablished Tobak's  role was  a serious  matter, as  was its\n\nfailure to  present evidence  indicating exactly what  is the\n\nstandard of care for an attorney performing that role.11\n\n                    \n\n11.  Specifically, the district court stated:\n\n          My  understanding is that the argument is\n          that  Mr. Tobac  (sic) allegedly  gave an\n          opinion upon which  the Plaintiff  relied\n          that  each of  the mortgages  in question\n          were  second  mortgages.    There  is  an\n          underlying factual issue here  of whether\n          or not in the first  place the defendant,\n          Tobac  (sic),  and   his  law  firm  were\n          engaged  for the purpose  of providing an\n          opinion with respect to the effect of the\n          two mortgages.  I'm  satisfied . . . that\n          this  is  a  circumstance  in  which it's\n          necessary to have  available to the  jury\n          expert opinion  with respect to  the duty\n          of  an  attorney  in  Mr.  Tobac's  (sic)\n          situation.   Particularly in light of the\n          fact  that his  situation  is unclear  to\n          begin with as to just exactly what he was\n          hired to do.  What his engagement was.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n     1.

Thus, even assuming that\n\nthe testimony of the three defendants did adduce the  claimed\n\nstandards, the jury could only speculate as to which standard\n\napplied to Tobak. See Lenius, 294 N.W.2d at 914 (jury may not\n                            \n\nbe  permitted to  speculate  as to  standard of  professional\n\nconduct).   Given  the parties'  dispute over  the employment\n\nissue, we believe that the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat  the  jury should  have  been  presented with  testimony\n\nconcerning the role assumed by--and concomitant duties of--an\n\nattorney  in Tobak's position; that is, hired by a party who,\n\non paper, is the lender,  but in reality is a  broker through\n\nwhom  the loan proceeds will  pass.  Because  Focus failed to\n\nclear  that hurdle, we need  not address the  adequacy of the\n\ntestimony that  was introduced  at trial. Instead,  given the\n                   \n\nfactual and legal landscape, we find that  the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded  that expert  testimony on the  nature of\n\nTobak's  role was  both required  and lacking,  and therefore\n\nproperly  granted judgment  as a  matter of  law in  favor of\n\nTobak and Abrams &amp; Verri.12\n\n                    \n\n12.

Here, there is  no dispute that  the promissory note\n\ngiven  to  Guardian  by  Marderosian and  assigned  to  Focus\n\nprovided for  20 percent  annual interest.   American claims,\n\nhowever,  that Shapiro's  assignment  to Focus  of a  $56,500\n\nconsulting fee  paid to Shapiro by  Marderosian's client Dean\n\nStreet    Development--an     assignment    which    occurred\n\ncontemporaneously  with  the  Marderosian   loan  agreement--\n\nconstituted  a  separate,  hidden  interest  payment  on  the\n\nMarderosian loan, bringing the actual annual interest rate on\n\nthe loan to 88 percent.\n\n          According to American's theory,  as a result of the\n\nusurious--and  therefore  void--mortgage,  Focus   failed  to\n\nacquire an insurable property interest and therefore suffered\n\n                    \n\ntime on appeal.\"   Goldman v.

The district\n\ncourt denied Focus's motion  for judgment as a matter  of law\n\nwith respect  to usury, and  allowed the  issue to go  to the\n\njury, giving the following instruction in the context of  the\n\ncontract claim:\n\n               Defendant  contends   that  payments\n          under a consulting agreement  executed at\n          the same time as  the loan agreement were\n          in reality interest payments on the loan.\n          If  you  find by  a preponderance  of the\n          evidence  that  the consulting  agreement\n          was  really a pretext  for the payment of\n          an illegal rate of interest, then you may\n                                                   \n          find  that  the  loan  was  unlawful  and\n          return  a verdict  for  Defendant on  the\n          contract claim. \n\n(Emphasis added).  American timely objected, arguing that the\n\nuse of the word \"may\" impermissibly gave the jury  discretion\n\nto find for Focus even  if it found the loan to  be usurious.\n\nThe court  did  not  change  the instruction,  and  the  jury\n\nawarded  Focus  $49,000  under  the  title  insurance  policy\n\ncovering  the mortgage  on  Marderosian's home.   On  appeal,\n\nAmerican  claims that  the  \"may\" instruction  was clear  and\n\nharmful error entitling  it to  a new trial.   After  careful\n\nreview, we agree.\n\n          Interestingly, Focus does  not directly dispute the\n\ncentral thesis of American's  appeal--the failure of the jury\n\ninstruction  to conform to the law  of usury as it relates to\n\ninsurable  interests.     Instead,  Focus   argues  that  (1)\n\nAmerican,  or  anyone else  other  than  the borrower,  lacks\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nstanding to raise the  usury defense; (2) American  failed to\n\nestablish  a  prima  facie case  of  usury;  and,  (3) it  is\n\n\"obvious\" that the jury found that the loan was not usurious,\n\ntherefore  rendering  any error  harmless.    Finding all  of\n\nFocus's arguments unpersuasive, we address each in turn.\n\n     1.  Standing\n                 \n\n          It is  ordinarily true, as Focus  asserts, that the\n\ndefense  of usury  is  personal to  the  borrower or  one  in\n\nprivity with  the borrower,  and unavailable to  strangers to\n\nthe  usurious  transaction. See  generally,  45  Am.

In  each of  these cases,\n\nhowever, the  party asserting the usury  claim was attempting\n\nto  avoid  repayment  of  a debt,  and  was  prohibited  from\n\ninterposing  the claim.  See,  e.g., Pinnix, 200  S.E. at 879\n                                           \n\n(\"to allow a  stranger to interpose the defense of usury to a\n\ncontract  with which the maker is  in all respects satisfied,\n\nand by the terms of which he desires to abide, and upon which\n\nhe is liable for a deficiency judgment,  would be exceedingly\n\nunfair to a debtor who  desires to perform his contract. .  .\n\n.\").  Unlike  the usury  theorists in  those cases,  however,\n\nAmerican  is not  attempting to  step into  the shoes  of the\n\nborrower,  Marderosian,  and  void  the loan.    Rather  than\n\nasserting  usury as  a  defense  to  repayment of  the  loan,\n\nAmerican  instead  argues that  the  usurious  nature of  the\n\nMarderosian   loan   rendered   Focus's   mortgage   interest\n\nuninsurable.  Indeed, there appears to be no dispute that had\n\nFocus  not acquiesced  to  Marderosian's motion  to  dismiss,\n\nMarderosian  would have  had the  right to interpose  a usury\n\ndefense.   Thus,  while American's  claim does  implicate the\n\nquestion  of usury, Focus's  \"personal defense\" theory--while\n\naccurate--is, in  our view, misplaced.   Accordingly, we turn\n\nto the substance of American's argument.\n\n          \"In order for recovery  [on an insurance policy] to\n\nbe  had, it  is  essential that  the  claimant show  both  an\n\nexisting contract  of insurance and an  insurable interest in\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nthe property.

The court accepted the insurance company's\n\nargument  that   the  bank,   by  charging  interest   on  an\n\nundisbursed  portion  of  the  loan,  effectively  charged  a\n\nusurious  rate  of  interest.

We are unpersuaded. \n\n          It is  true, as Focus  points out, that  the Phalen\n                                                             \n\nmajority concluded its opinion  by stating: \"[W]e stress that\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nour  holding has resulted from  and is limited  to the unique\n\nfacts  and circumstances presented in  this case.   We do not\n\nintend  by this decision to  depart from the  general rule in\n\nthis  state  that the  defense of  usury  is personal  to the\n\nborrower.\"    Id. at  141.    Nowhere, however,  does  Phalen\n                                                             \n\nindicate   what  \"unique   facts   and  circumstances\"   were\n\npresented.    Irrespective   of  this  qualifying   language,\n\nhowever,  Phalen's  holding   remains  inescapable--that   no\n                  \n\ninsurable  interest can  arise  out of  a usurious  mortgage.\n\nMoreover,  as   we  previously  noted,   the  \"general  rule\"\n\nregarding usury is inapposite to this case, where American is\n\nnot asserting a usury  defense, as such. Finally, even  if we\n\nwere   to   accept  Focus's   argument   concerning  Phalen's\n                                                             \n\nlimitations, we note that Phalen's conclusion with respect to\n                                  \n\nusury  was but  a  small part  of  a broader  inquiry;  i.e.,\n\nwhether  an insurable  interest can  arise out  of a  void or\n\nunenforceable contract.   The answer generally  appears to be\n\nnegative.   See  supra  pp. 27-29.    Nor does  Midwest  help\n                                                       \n\nFocus's cause.  In Midwest, the  court precluded an insurance\n                          \n\ncompany  from asserting  a usury  defense in  an action  by a\n\nmortgagee seeking recovery under a fire policy.  Although the\n\ncourt  cited  Phalen for  the  \"general  rule\" regarding  the\n                    \n\npersonal nature of the usury defense, Id. at 695, the court's\n                                         \n\ndecision--and that  of the trial  court, see id.  at 695--was\n                                                \n\nbased on a Minnesota statute which precluded all corporations\n                                                             \n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n\nfrom invoking a usury  defense. Id.  Notably,  the \"insurable\n                                   \n\ninterest\" aspect  of Phalen  was never addressed  in Midwest,\n                                                            \n\nmuch less limited  or distinguished.  Finally,  to the extent\n\nthat Midwest can be  construed to run counter to  Phalen, the\n                                                        \n\nlatter  remains  the  pronouncement  of  Minnesota's  highest\n\ncourt.   Based on the foregoing, we find that American could,\n\nunder these circumstances, properly raise its usury argument.\n\n     2.  Prima Facie Case\n                         \n\n          To support its claim of usury, American argues that\n\nShapiro's assignment  of rights under  a consulting agreement\n\nwith  Dean Street Development  constituted hidden, additional\n\ninterest,  apart from  the  20 percent  rate  charged in  the\n\nMarderosian  loan documents.   Under  American's theory,  the\n\nactual  interest rate  was  88 percent.    Focus responds  by\n\nrelying on the apparent separateness  between Marderosian and\n\nthe parties to  the consulting fee.  Implicitly, the district\n\ncourt rejected Focus's prima facie argument, as it denied its\n\nmotion for directed verdict on the usury issue.  We reject it\n\nas  well.    In  short, Focus's  argument  ignores  authority\n\nholding that\n\n           \"[u]sury is not  determined merely  from\n          what    the    parties   represent    the\n          transaction  to  be, but  the  court will\n          look  to  the   whole  transaction,   the\n          surrounding       circumstances,      the\n          occurrences  at  the time  of  making the\n          agreement,  and  the  instruments  drawn.\n          Whether  a transaction legal  on its face\n          is, in  fact, merely  a  device to  cover\n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\n          usury generally is a question of fact for\n          the jury.\" \n\n45 Am. Jur.  2d Interest  and Usury    112 (1969) (and  cases\n                                   \n\ncited therein) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          Here, there is evidence that the loan proceeds were\n\nintended for Dean Street Development, a Marderosian client in\n\nneed  of \"discreet\" funding and there is no question that the\n\nassignment from  Shapiro to Focus  was finalized at  the same\n\ntime as the loan from Focus to Marderosian.  Finally, the sum\n\npayable under the assignment  were due to be repaid  April 6,\n\n1989, the same  day as the loan.  Focus  argues that the loan\n\nand   assignment   were   entirely   separate   transactions,\n\ncharacterizing  the assignment as  nothing more  than Shapiro\n\nsharing his  broker's commission with  Focus, a  non-usurious\n\ntransaction.   While the jury, of course, is entirely free to\n\naccept  either version of the  facts, it is  quite clear that\n\nAmerican has at least made out a prima facie case of usury.\n\n     3.  The Instruction\n                        \n\n          As the  above discussion makes clear,  if, in fact,\n\nthe jury were to find the loan to Marderosian usurious, then,\n\nas a matter of law, Focus would have no insurable interest in\n\nthe  collateral mortgages.  Therefore, the instruction, which\n\nused the  permissive \"may,\"  allowed for  both  a finding  of\n                                              \n\nusury and a verdict  for Focus on  its contract claim.   This\n\n                             -35-\n                              35\n\nwas  error.13   Accordingly,  American is  entitled to  a new\n\ntrial   on  Focus's  contract   claim,  accompanied   by  the\n\nappropriate instruction on usury.  \n\n                             IV.\n                                \n\n                          Conclusion\n                                    \n\n          For the  reasons stated herein, the  judgment below\n\nis  vacated insofar  as it  awarded damages  to Focus  on its\n    vacated\n           \n\ncontract claim, and affirmed in all other respects.\n                    affirmed\n                            \n\n                    \n\n13.  We find  nothing in the  record to support  Focus's bald\nassertion  that the error was harmless because \"it is obvious\nthat the jury found that the loan was not usurious.\"\n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n</pre>",
