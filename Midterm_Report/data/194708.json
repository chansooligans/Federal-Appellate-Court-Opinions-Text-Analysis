Defendant Raymond Moreno,  Jr.,\n                          \n\nappeals his  conviction in the district  court for possession\n\nof  an unregistered  firearm,  26 U.S.C.     5861(d), and  of\n\nammunition  by  a convicted  felon,  18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1).\n\nMoreno  argues  that  evidence  was lacking  to  support  the\n\nverdict;  that   the  court   erred  in  admitting   what  he\n\ncharacterizes  as  evidence of  \"prior  bad  acts;\" and  that\n\ncomments by the  prosecutors to  the jury deprived  him of  a\n\nfair  trial.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm Moreno's\n\nconvictions.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Moreno  first  argues  that the  evidence  introduced at\n\ntrial was  insufficient.  Our inquiry  is a limited  one:  to\n\ndecide whether there was evidence from which a rational trier\n\nof  fact could have concluded beyond  a reasonable doubt that\n\nMoreno possessed the firearm  and the ammunition.  Legitimate\n\ninferences  must  be  drawn,  and  credibility determinations\n\nresolved,  in favor  of the  verdict.   See United  States v.\n                                                             \n\nAnguilo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1197 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 130 (1990).\n\n     From   the  government's   evidence  at   trial  (Moreno\n\npresented no evidence  of his own),  a reasonable jury  could\n\nhave found the following.  On the evening of  April 18, 1991,\n\na  group of  five  law enforcement  officers,  while on  foot\n\npatrol  in the  Lenox Street  Housing Development  in Boston,\n\n                             -2-\n\nMassachusetts, heard a series of gunshots coming from another\n\narea within the development.  Three of the officers, Officers\n\nGarvey,  Perkins and  Devane,  ran in  the  direction of  the\n\nshots;  the other  two,  Officer Murphy  and Trooper  Drummy,\n\nreturned to their parked cruisers.\n\n     As the  three officers were running  down Hammond Street\n\nin  the direction  of the  shots, they  observed  three black\n\nmales,  all  wearing  black  hooded sweatshirts  or  jackets,\n\nemerge from a courtyard in the direction of the gunshots, run\n\nacross  Hammond  Street  and  disappear  near  a  cluster  of\n\nbuildings across the  street.  One of the  officers described\n\nthe  three men  as  running in  a  line in  a \"hunched  over\"\n\nmanner.   There  was  only  the  briefest interval  when  the\n\ndefendants together  disappeared from view.   Almost at once,\n\ntwo  of the three officers, joined by Officer Murphy (who had\n\nleft his cruiser to assist in the foot pursuit), saw the same\n\nthree men running through a parking lot behind the cluster of\n\nbuildings, and gave chase.  \n\n     The officers then saw one of the three men veer off from\n\nthe  other two and  run in a separate  direction.  The second\n\nand third men were then seen by the officers to come together\n\nbriefly and appeared to pass an object between them.  Officer\n\nMurphy, who was closest to the two individuals, described the\n\nitem being exchanged as a dark object about one to one-and-a-\n\nhalf feet long.  The individual who took this object then ran\n\n                             -3-\n\noff  through a grass courtyard.  The individual who passed on\n\nthe   object  immediately  stopped,   raised  his   arms  and\n\nsurrendered.   That  individual was  later identified  as the\n\ndefendant, Raymond Moreno, Jr.\n\n     Officer Garvey,  in order to  cut off any  escape route,\n\nhad  circled  around  to  the  opposite  end  of   the  grass\n\ncourtyard.   Officer Garvey soon  saw a black  male wearing a\n\nblack hooded sweatshirt enter the courtyard from  the area in\n\nwhich Moreno had just  been arrested.  After telling  the man\n\nseveral  times to  stop, Officer  Garvey saw  the man  make a\n\ngesture as if to throw an object aside, and then heard a soft\n\nthud  on the  ground  nearby.    The  man  was  arrested  and\n\nidentified as  Frederick Hardy,  who was tried  and convicted\n\nalong  with Moreno  but is  not a  party to  this appeal.   A\n\nsearch of the area  revealed a .32 caliber pistol  about five\n\nto  eight feet from where Hardy stopped and made the throwing\n\ngesture.\n\n     When arrested,  Hardy was not in possession of the foot-\n\nlong  object  that the  officers  had seen  him  receive from\n\nMoreno.  The officers then searched the path between the area\n\nof Moreno's arrest and the spot at which Officer Garvey first\n\nobserved Hardy.   Hidden in bushes  along that direct  route,\n\nthe officers found a double-barrelled sawed-off  shotgun with\n\na 12  1/2 inch barrel, fully loaded with ammunition.  This is\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe firearm and  ammunition which Moreno  is charged in  this\n\ncase with having possessed.\n\n     While  Moreno and  Hardy  were being  arrested,  Officer\n\nDevane was  in search of the first  of the three runners, who\n\nhad  gone  off  in  a separate  direction.    Officer  Devane\n\ndiscovered  a black  male,  sweating and  out  of breath  and\n\nwearing  a black  hooded sweatshirt,  hiding in  some bushes.\n\nAfter arresting the individual and placing him  in a cruiser,\n\nOfficer Devane  found a  semi-automatic pistol on  the ground\n\nnear where the individual had been hiding.  The pistol was in\n\nthe  lock-back position, smelled of gunpowder, and was out of\n\nammunition, indicating  that it recently had been discharged.\n\nThe arrested individual was identified as Steven Fernandes.\n\n     Several officers  then went back to  a central courtyard\n\nin  the  middle  of  the  Lenox  Housing  Development.   This\n\ncourtyard was in the general area of the gunshots, and it was\n\nimmediately accessible from the spot where the three arrested\n\nmen were first observed  by the officers.  In  the courtyard,\n\nthe officers found discharged cartridge casings.  These spent\n\ncasings were  matched by  a ballistics expert  to the  pistol\n\nthat was found next to Stephen Fernandes.\n\n     At the  police station  after his arrest,  Moreno, after\n\nreceiving his Miranda warning, denied knowing either Hardy or\n                     \n\nFernandes.  He claimed that he had been standing alone in the\n\nhousing development when he  heard shots and started running.\n\n                             -5-\n\nAt  trial, however,  a  resident of  the housing  development\n\ntestified that  he had  seen Moreno together  with Hardy  and\n\nFernandes  a number  of  times  over  the  prior  year.    In\n\naddition, Officer Dreary of  the Boston Police testified that\n\nin March 1991 he stopped a  red Isuzu Trooper; Hardy was  the\n\ndriver and Moreno was a passenger in the front seat.\n\n     We  think  a reasonable  jury  could  conclude beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt from this evidence that Moreno possessed the\n\nsawed-off  shotgun  and  its  ammunition.    Officer  Perkins\n\ntestified that he \"saw [the two men] meet and . . . could see\n\nthem  having some  kind of  exchange,\" but  he was  not close\n\nenough  to describe  the  object.   Officer  Murphy, who  was\n\ncloser to the men, did observe the object--which he described\n\nas \"about a foot and a half [long]\" and \"dark  in color.\"  It\n\nwas  found directly in the path Hardy took after the exchange\n\nwith  Moreno, prior  to his  apprehension by  Officer Garvey.\n\nOnce the police testimony  is credited, Moreno is effectively\n\ntied to the loaded shotgun.  \n\n     The direct evidence as to the  shotgun was reinforced by\n\nother  evidence.   First,  Moreno  and  the individuals  seen\n\nrunning away were  fleeing from  an area in  which shots  had\n\nbeen fired--shots that the jury could infer had been fired by\n\none of  the group, since  a pistol  belonging to  one of  the\n\nthree  matched  shell  casings  found  in  the  area  of  the\n\ngunshots.  Second,  Moreno's false denial after his arrest of\n\n                             -6-\n\na  prior relationship  with  Hardy and  Fernandes suggests  a\n\nguilty  mind and helps rebut any inference that he was merely\n\nin wrong place at wrong time.  The direct evidence, bolstered\n\nby  these  secondary  inferences,  was more  than  enough  to\n\nsupport the jury's verdict.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Next, Moreno argues that the trial court committed error\n\nby  allowing  the government  to  introduce  evidence of  the\n\ngunshots heard  by the officers prior to Moreno's arrest, the\n\nsemi-automatic  pistol found  with  Fernandes and  the  spent\n\nshell casings matching that  pistol.  Describing the evidence\n\nas proof of \"other crimes\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), Moreno\n\nargues that this  evidence related only  to his character  or\n\npropensity  to commit  crime  rather than  to any  legitimate\n\nissue in the  case.   Rule 404(b) provides  that evidence  of\n\n\"other crimes,  wrongs or  acts\" is  not admissible to  prove\n\n\"the  character  of  a person  in  order  to  show action  in\n\nconformity  therewith.\"   Such  evidence  is not  prohibited,\n\nhowever,  if  offered for  \"other purposes.\"   Fed.  R. Evid.\n\n404(b).  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n     In this case, the government's evidence of the gunshots,\n\nFernandes' pistol, the matching spent ammunition, and Hardy's\n\nweapon  supports a  chain  of inferences  independent of  any\n\ntendency of the evidence to show bad character.  The evidence\n\n                             -7-\n\npermits the  inference that Fernandes, with  Hardy and Moreno\n\nin   attendance,  was  the   individual  who  discharged  the\n\ngunshots, and that  the three men were  running together from\n\nthe  scene of  that  discharge  when  first observed  by  the\n\nofficers.  In turn,  the facts that Fernandes and  Hardy were\n\narmed  and that  the  three men  were fleeing  together after\n\nFernandes had  discharged three rounds of  ammunition made it\n\nsomewhat  more likely that the object Moreno was seen to pass\n\nalong  to Hardy  was indeed  the shotgun later  found nearby.\n\nSee, e.g., United  States v.  Currier, 821 F.2d  52, 55  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1987) (the  proffered evidence  of  other bad  acts was\n\n\"closely intertwined  with the charged offense of possession,\n\nproviding both significant contextual material and proof that\n\nthe defendant possessed the gun\").\n\n     An  example   may  be  of  help   in  understanding  the\n\ninference.  If a defendant were charged with shooting a guard\n\nin  the  course  of  a  bank  robbery,  it  would  surely  be\n\npermissible to show that he was caught fleeing from the scene\n\nof  a  just-robbed  bank  with  two other  persons  who  both\n\npossessed weapons.   The  defendant could certainly  argue to\n\nthe  jury that he was  an innocent bystander  who was fleeing\n\nfrom a dangerous scene.  But the fact of the bank robbery and\n\nthe possession  of the weapons by  others arguably associated\n\nwith the defendant would surely be relevant evidence that the\n\njury  could consider  along with  other evidence  against the\n\n                             -8-\n\ndefendant.   If the  other evidence included  some eyewitness\n\ntestimony  that the defendant had run with the others and had\n\nappeared to be carrying a weapon,  the facts would not be far\n\nfrom our case.\n\n     Indeed, not  only are  the gun  shots and  other weapons\n\nrelevant  to the  government's  case against  Moreno but  the\n\nordinary  risks   presented  by  Rule  404(b)   evidence  are\n\nespecially tame in this  case.  The hand-guns were  not found\n\nwith  Moreno but with other defendants and the gun shots were\n\napparently fired by Fernandes.   In other words  the evidence\n\nsuggested \"other crimes\"  not by Moreno but by  Fernandes and\n\nHardy.  The usual taint  of \"other crimes\" evidence--the risk\n\nthat the jury will think  the defendant a bad man  because he\n\ncommitted other crimes--was, so  far as it threatened Moreno,\n\nlargely  absent.    If  the  jury  otherwise  thought him  an\n\ninnocent  bystander, it had no reason to attribute to him the\n\ncrimes of Fernandes and Hardy.\n\n     Of course, if the jury accepted the officers' testimony,\n\nit could conclude that Moreno was  not a bystander innocently\n\nfleeing  from danger but rather was associated with the other\n\ndefendants,  had run with them, had handed off his own weapon\n                         \n\nto Hardy, and had after his arrest falsely denied knowing the\n\nother two.   If so,  the evidence of  gunshots furnished  the\n\noccasion and context for the flight by all  three defendants;\n\nand  the  weapons possessed  by the  other  two made  it more\n\n                             -9-\n\nlikely, if only slightly, that Moreno too might be armed.  At\n\nleast the  jury  was entitled  to  consider the  evidence  of\n\ngunshots and  other weapons  and draw  such inferences  if it\n\nchose to do so. \n\n     In  short,  the evidence  was  clearly  admissible on  a\n\ntheory entirely  separate from any  light it might  cast upon\n\nMoreno's \"character.\"  Whether the relevance of such evidence\n\nis substantially  outweighed by  its prejudicial effect  is a\n\njudgment  largely within  the broad  discretion of  the trial\n\njudge.  Fed. R.  Evid. 403; United States v.  Simon, 842 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n552, 553 (1st Cir. 1988).  A defendant is entitled on request\n\nto a limiting instruction,  warning the jury not to  draw the\n\nforbidden  inference of  bad character.   Fed. R.  Evid. 105.\n\nMoreno's  counsel  in   this  case  did  not   seek  such  an\n\ninstruction, requesting  only a far  broader one to  which he\n\nwas not entitled.1\n\n                             III.\n\n     The  most  troubling  aspect  of  this  appeal  concerns\n\nstatements  made by  the  government during  argument to  the\n\njury.   In his opening remarks, the prosecutor stated, \"[T]he\n\nevidence  will show  that  [the police  officers] were  doing\n\n                    \n\n     1Asked what limiting instruction he would like, Moreno's\ncounsel  asked for  one  telling the  jury  that evidence  of\nFernandes' pistol and the  spent shell casings \"is not  to be\nconsidered against the case of Mr. Moreno\" or  \"in no way can\nbe used by  this jury\"  against Moreno.   Since the  evidence\ncould  properly be  used against  Moreno, the  district court\nquite properly refused this instruction.\n\n                             -10-\n\ntheir jobs protecting the community that  has been plagued by\n\nviolence, senseless violence, shootings and killings.  That's\n\nwhy they were there and that's why we're here today.\"\n\n     There  was, of  course,  no  evidence  in this  case  of\n\n\"senseless violence\" or \"shootings  and killings,\" and it was\n\npatently improper for the prosecutor to make these remarks to\n\nthe jury.   The argument, playing  upon the jury's  emotional\n\nreaction to neighborhood violence,  was outside the bounds of\n\nlegitimate  argument  and cannot  be  condoned.   See  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Johnson,  952  F.2d  565,  574  (1st  Cir.  1991)\n                   \n\n(admonishing  \"prosecutorial  commentary  serving no  purpose\n\nother  than to  inflame the  passions and  prejudices of  the\n\njury,  and  to interject  issues  broader than  the  guilt or\n\ninnocence of the accused\"  (citations and internal quotations\n\nomitted)), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 58 (1992).\n                       \n\n     We do not believe,  however, that reversal is warranted.\n\nThe  experienced trial judge, who was in the best position to\n\nappraise the prejudicial  impact of the  prosecutor's remark,\n\nthought  a curative  instruction  the correct  remedy.   When\n\nobjection was made,  at the end of the  prosecutor's opening,\n\nthe trial judge forcefully cautioned the jury:\n\n     I must give you some instructions to disregard some\n     of  the  things  that  were  said  in  the  opening\n     statement.   There were  references to  violence in\n     the area, to other incidents in the area than those\n     that  are the subject matter of this trial.  I will\n     instruct you to disregard  all of those references.\n     Some were made very early in the opening statement,\n     others were made in the course of it and toward the\n\n                             -11-\n\n     end of the opening  statement.  We are here  to try\n     on the evidence with respect to the charges against\n     these  defendants, only  the charges  against these\n     defendants.    It  is  not  your  function  or  the\n     function  of  the  court   or  anyone  else  to  be\n     concerned about  anything  other than  the  charges\n     against these defendants  and the evidence  bearing\n     upon  that.   You  will erase  from  your mind  the\n     arguments  about  other  violence,  and  the phrase\n     \"senseless  killings\"  was  used.    Those are  not\n     matters to  be considered by  you as you  weigh and\n     evaluate the evidence that relates to this case.\n\nWe think that  this powerful and  contemporaneous instruction\n\nwas  adequate   to  dispel   any  prejudice  caused   by  the\n\nprosecutor's remarks.   See United  States v. Giry,  818 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n120, 134 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 855 (1987).\n                                 \n\n     What  is  no less  disturbing  is that,  even  after the\n\nwarning  embodied by this  instruction, the  prosecutor again\n\ndeparted from the straight and narrow in his closing.  In the\n\ncourse of arguing that  the shotgun was not just  tossed away\n\nbut   deliberately   concealed,  the   prosecutor--apparently\n\ncarried away--continued:   \"Forget about the  fact that maybe\n\nMr.  Hooker [who lived nearby] or  his wife or his three kids\n\nmight come  out and look at the gun and get their heads blown\n\noff.\"   The court then  gave a lengthy  curative instruction,\n\nand the case  proceeded.  The curative instruction was rather\n\noblique  on this  issue  but  it  was  lengthy,  and  we  are\n\n                             -12-\n\nsatisfied  that the jury got  the message to  ignore what had\n\njust been said.2\n\n     If  we thought  that this  second foray  was deliberate,\n\nthere might  well be a basis for  reversal as a deterrent for\n\nthe  future, see United States  v. Capone, 683  582, 586 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1982), even though this remark  did not directly relate\n\nto  Moreno for nothing in  the evidence suggested that Moreno\n\nhad carelessly concealed the weapon  where Mr. Hooker or  his\n\nfamily  might find it; that was the act of another defendant.\n\nIn context, however, the  prosecutor's remark does not appear\n\nto have been  a deliberate disregard of the  court's earlier,\n\nimplied warning.  Rather,  although improper it was seemingly\n\na  sudden  expression of  indignation  at the  tail-end  of a\n\nlegitimate larger point.  \n\n     Finally,  in  appraising possible  prejudice, we  do not\n\nignore the fact that the case  against Moreno was ample.   As\n\nwe  said in Giry, 818  F.2d at 133,  \"prejudice that survives\n                \n\nthe charge is deemed less likely to have affected the outcome\n\nof the trial where strong evidence supports the prosecution's\n\ncase\".  Here, both  judges who join in this  majority opinion\n\nhave  independently reviewed  the  transcripts  of the  trial\n\ntestimony in this case,  in addition to the briefs;  and both\n\n                    \n\n     2The judge was, at the same time, cautioning the jury to\ngive  no  weight to  any personal  opinions expressed  by the\nprosecutor, then  or earlier.  After  completing the curative\ninstruction, the  judge gave  the lawyers the  opportunity to\nask for more, and neither requested any addition.\n\n                             -13-\n\nare satisfied that the  case against Moreno was  quite strong\n\nand that the  objectionable remarks, in context and  in light\n\nof  the instructions given by the trial judge, would not have\n\nswayed the jury.\n\n     As  the  evidence  already  recited  shows,  Moreno  was\n\ndirectly identified  by two  police officers as  running from\n\nthe area after gunshots.  He was seen by one  of the officers\n\nto hand  over a  foot-long object  to a  second man, and  the\n\nsawed-off shotgun in question  was found near the path  where\n\nthe  third one had run shortly before he too was apprehended.\n\nThis  evidence was  coupled with  other evidence  showing the\n\npossession of  weapons by  Moreno's companions, their  flight\n\ntogether with  Moreno, and Moreno's denials that  he knew the\n\nother  two--denials  proved  to  be false  by  two  different\n\nwitnesses.\n\n     The trial of this  relatively simple case stretched over\n\n10 days.  The  trial time was devoted entirely  to government\n\nevidence, since the defendants  did not testify and presented\n\nno  witnesses of  their  own.    The  government  put  on  21\n\nwitnesses, including  five officers  who were present  at the\n\ntime that Moreno was pursued and whose key testimony has been\n\nsummarized  above.  We also note that, although this does not\n\nexcuse  the  government's  missteps,  defense   counsel  made\n\narguments  before the  jury that  were not  beyond criticism,\n\nincluding cross-examination  inappropriately injecting racial\n\n                             -14-\n\nissues  into the  case.   In sum,  the government's  case was\n\nsubstantial and the imperfections in counsel's  rhetoric were\n\nnot all on one side.     On  balance,  we are  convinced that\n\nthe prosecutor's missteps  did not deprive  Moreno of a  fair\n\ntrial or a  just outcome.  The  prosecutor's improper remarks\n\nwere by  and large aberrations, met  by prompt countervailing\n\ninstructions, in  a 10-day trial that  was otherwise consumed\n\nby a detailed  exposition of  the events of  April 18,  1991.\n\nThis court has found  that even more objectionable statements\n\nby prosecutors  did not  warrant reversal where  a corrective\n\ninstruction  was given, e.g., Giry, 818 F.2d at 120 (argument\n                                  \n\ncomparing charged  drug offenses  to an \"agree[ment]  to kill\n\nthe judge\"), or no  timely objection was made,   e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Machor, 879 F.2d  945, 955 (1st  Cir. 1989) (drugs\n                 \n\n\"poisoning our community, and our kids die because of this\"),\n\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 1094 (1990).  The district court acted\n            \n\nwithin  its discretion in  this case  in concluding  that the\n\nprosecutor's misstatements did not  so \"poison[] the well\" as\n\nto require a new  trial.  United States v.  Mejia-Lozano, 829\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir. 1987).3\n\n                    \n\n     3We have  reviewed the  other remarks of  the prosecutor\nobjected to by Moreno, including the distinct claims that the\nprosecutor disparaged defense counsel and engaged in improper\nexpressions of personal belief.  In  some instances, we think\nthe prosecutor made permissible  arguments and in others, all\nmilder  than the two discussed in text, we think the curative\ninstructions given were adequate.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     Nevertheless,  for the  sake of  future cases,  we think\n\nthis worth saying:  inflammatory comments to the jury are not\n\nonly  bad  tactics in  the case  at  hand but,  especially if\n\nrepeated  after warnings,  will exhaust  the patience  of the\n\ncourt  and   gradually  undermine   the  reputation  of   the\n\nprosecutor's office.   Trials, to  be sure,  are hard  fought\n\ncontests  where not  every remark  can be  carefully weighed.\n\nBut for the government  in a criminal case, fairness  is more\n\nimportant than victory.  Although we view the evidence as far\n\nmore substantial than does  our dissenting colleague and have\n\nsome (but  not blind)  faith in corrective  instructions, the\n\ngovernment would do well to take this warning seriously.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -16-\n\n   TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).  With all due respect\n                           \n\nto my  esteemed colleagues in the majority, I must dissent.  I do\n\nso   reluctantly   because  although   I   disagree   with  their\n\ncharacterization of the strength  of the evidence against Moreno,\n\nsee ante  at 13, I agree that in all probability the jury verdict\n      \n\nwould have been the  same sans the breaches committed  during the\n                            \n\ntrial.  My reticence,  however, is not sufficient to  overcome my\n\nperturbation  at what I  perceive to be  the virtual condonation,\n\nwith  nary  but  mild  admonitions   on  our  part,  of  repeated\n\nprosecutorial transgressions,  almost to the point  of a pattern.\n\nSee,  e.g., United States v. Agudelo, No. 90-1465, 1993 U.S. App.\n                                  \n\nLEXIS  4970 (1st  Cir.  March 18,  1993)  (admission of  improper\n\ntestimony);   United States v.  Williams, 985 F.2d  634 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1993) (admission  of improper evidence); United  States v.

The majority  itself points\n\nout  similar cases  falling  within this  pattern,  but fails  to\n\nappreciate  the extent  of its  perniciousness.   See ante  at 14\n                                                        \n\n(citing Machor, supra,  and Giry, supra, as  examples of \"fierce\"\n                                     \n\narguments by prosecutors).  Compounding this problem is  the fact\n\nthat Rule  404(b)  and  the harmless  error  doctrine  have  been\n\nconverted, not to  say subverted,  into a wall  behind which  the\n\nGovernment apparently can continue ad infinitum to take pot shots\n                                             \n\nwith impunity.\n\n                             -16-\n\n   I register my  protest because our  past cautions, timid  as\n\nthey were, see, e.g., Agudelo, slip op. at 6 n.7 (\"this is not to\n                           \n\nforget our complaint . . . about giving  the government two bites\n\nat the apple:  push for evidence believed to be damning, and then\n\nsay it was meaningless\");  Williams, slip op. at 8-9  (\"to infect\n                                 \n\nand  jeopardize a  prosecution with  such evidence is  unwise and\n\nunjustifiable\"),  have  not only  been  ignored,  but alas,  have\n\nprobably  encouraged this  continued conduct.    I fear  that the\n\ncurrent warning, ante at 15, although somewhat more forceful than\n                   \n\nthose  that  have come  before, is  likely  to further  erode our\n\ninstitutional credibility, if  the past is any  indication of the\n\nfuture.    More  importantly,  I believe  that  the  prosecutor's\n\nactions  in  the   present  case  unconstitutionally   prejudiced\n\nMoreno's right to a fair trial.\n\n   To  set the  trial in  proper perspective,  a review  of the\n\nfacts  is  appropriate.   Three  unidentified  persons were  seen\n\nrunning from the sound  of gunfire; at some point  thereafter one\n\nof  these persons appeared to pass a one to one-and-one-half foot\n                        \n\nlong dark object  to another person who kept on  running with the\n\nunknown object; the passer then stopped running, was arrested (we\n\nknow  not for  what  crime at  this  point), and  eventually  was\n\nidentified  as Moreno;  a  person later  identified as  Frederick\n\nHardy,  the receiver of  the unknown object,  was intercepted and\n\narrested coming  from where Moreno  was detained; Hardy  was seen\n\nthrowing  away  an object,  which was  later recovered  and which\n\nturned out  to be a .32 caliber pistol; no other weapon was found\n\n                             -17-\n\non or near Hardy, but a search of his suspected  route revealed a\n\nloaded, double  barrel, sawed off  shotgun, hidden in  the bushes\n\nalong the  direct  path  from  where Moreno  was  arrested;  this\n\nshotgun and its ammunition  are the weapons with which  Moreno is\n\ncharged with illegally possessing.  \n\n   At trial, the prosecutor  introduced as Rule 404(b) evidence\n\nagainst Moreno a third  weapon found elsewhere in  the possession\n                                            \n\nof a  third individual, Stephen Fern ndes.   This weapon was  a 9\n         \n\nmm. caliber pistol, as well as 10 casings fired from  that weapon\n\nat the scene of the original shooting.\n\n   The prosecutor  also  made improper  statements, which  fall\n\ninto three groups, at different points.  First,     he     linked\n\nappellant to the  rampant violence in the community, insisting at\n\nopening argument that \"the evidence  will show that [the  police]\n\nwere doing  their jobs  protecting the  community  that has  been\n\nplagued by violence, senseless violence, shootings and killings.\"\n\nHe continued \"[t]hat's why  they were there and that's  why we're\n\nhere  today.\"  The prosecutor referred to the officers as members\n\nof an anti-gang unit  on four occasions, and instructed  the jury\n\nnot  to \"reward\"  the  defendants for  discarding  weapons.   The\n\nprosecutor injected violence at  every opportunity, stating,  for\n\nexample,  that  \"[i]f you're  walking  down  the  street  with  a\n\nbaseball  bat, it's not  illegal to possess  it.  If  you use the\n\nbaseball  bat to  bash in  somebody's head, that's  illegal,\" and\n\nthat \"Mr. Hooker or his wife orhis three kids might  come out and\n\nlook at  the gun and get  their heads blown off.\"   In describing\n\n                             -18-\n\nthe shotgun,  which had  not  been fired,  the prosecutor  argued\n\n\"[s]omebody  had to move that  lever, crack open  that barrel and\n\nput those two  shotgun shells  into the shotgun.   Somebody  does\n\nthat for a reason.   Just remember that these  three people armed\n\nthemselves with three guns.\"  The prosecutor proceeded \"[a]ll you\n\nhad  to do  was pull  the trigger.   Think  about going  into the\n\nmiddle  of  that housing  development  armed  with those  weapons\n\ntogether and firing one of these weapons.\"  \n\n   Second, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the government\n\nwitnesses, intimating that they possessed some information beyond\n\nthe evidence  presented.  In discussing  the \"cylindrical object\"\n\nthat appellant  passed on  to another individual,  the prosecutor\n\nwarranted  that the  police \"knew  what it  was, but  they're not\n\noverstating  their testimony.\"   He  later asserted  \"[t]hey knew\n\nwhat the object was.  They were going to find it.\"\n\n   Third,   the  prosecutor   urged  the   jury  to   disregard\n\nappellant's counsel  because defense  attorneys \"are paid  to see\n\nsee  [sic]  things  in  a   different  way.\"    Furthermore,  the\n\nprosecutor  contended  at  one  point that  defense  counsel  was\n\n\"talking  out of  both  sides of  his  mouth.\"   The  prosecutor,\n\ndiscussing a defense argument, explained \"I'm not quite sure what\n\nthat meant, but I would suggest that a part of it was designed to\n\ndivert your attention.\"   \n\n   As  the  majority points  out,  the  prosecution's statement\n\nappealing  to  the  jury's  fear  of  neighborhood  violence  was\n\n\"patently  improper\"  and  \"outside  the  bounds  of   legitimate\n\n                             -19-\n\nargument and cannot be condoned.\"  Id. at pp. 10-11.   \"[N]o less\n                                    \n\ndisturbing,\"  finds  the majority,  is  that  \"even after  [being\n\nwarned]  the  prosecutor again  departed  from  the straight  and\n\nnarrow  in  his closing.\"    Id. at  12.   This  would  have been\n                              \n\nsufficient  basis for  \"reversal  as a  deterrent,\" the  majority\n\ntells us, only if \"this second foray [had been] deliberate.\"  Id.\n                                                               \n\nThis  observation is  irrelevant if  the  prosecutor's statements\n\ncaused  harm to  defendant, and  harm  undoubtedly was  caused by\n\nthese and other statements.\n\n   My colleagues place too much faith on the practical value of\n\nthe curative instructions given by the trial judge, the second of\n\nwhich  was   admittedly  \"rather   oblique\"  as  to   the  matter\n\nobjected.4  Id.  at 12;  see also United  States v.

Feb.  2, 1993) (\"it is  the combination of the\n\ntrial  judge's  instructions  .   .  .  that  would  render   the\n\nprosecutor's  putative violation  harmless\").   Empirical studies\n\nhave established  that juries tend to  consider relevant evidence\n\nin a case even when  it is ordered stricken from the record.  See\n                                                               \n\nReid Hastie, Steven  D.

In fact,  juries are even  more likely to\n  \n\nconsider such evidence if admonished by the court not to consider\n\nit, than if  no specific instruction is  given.

Even more troublesome\n                        \n\nto  a criminal  defendant  in Moreno's  position are  the studies\n\nindicating  that  juries   tend  to  forget  the  source  of  the\n\ninformation they remember, and are often unable to recall whether\n\nthe source of information came from a witness, or from one of the\n\nattorneys during the opening statement or  closing argument.

The studies\n\n                             -21-\n\ndiscussed  above clearly  demonstrate a  common sense  conclusion\n\nwith empirical data:  the  prejudicial influence of such argument\n\nand  evidence should not be  easily disregarded in  the manner we\n\nhave done,  as it flows more  deeply than we have  assumed.5  The\n\nstudies lead  to  one inescapable  conclusion in  regard to  this\n\ncase:  there is no way of knowing if the stricken remarks were in\n\nfact  not influential in prejudicing  the jury in  a powerful and\n\nlasting way, and thus tipping the balance against him.\n\n   To this prejudice  we add the impact on the  jury of the so-\n\ncalled 404(b) evidence.  This evidence proffered under the  aegis\n\nof this rule consisted of:  (1) testimony that pistol shots fired\n                                                   \n\nby  unknown  persons  were  heard  by  police  officers prior  to\n         \n\nMoreno's arrest; (2) a 9 mm. caliber pistol that was found on the\n                                         \n\nground near another individual; and  (3) ten spent shell  casings\n                 \n\nmatching  that pistol,  which  were found  near  area from  which\n                   \n\nMoreno and three other men were seen running from after the shots\n\nwere heard.  As noted, supra at 15, the 9 mm. pistol was found in\n                          \n\npossession of a third person, Stephen Fern ndes, who was not even\n\ntried  together with appellant.  All this evidence was allowed as\n\nprobative  in establishing  \"other  crimes, wrongs  or acts,\"  by\n                                                               \n\n                  \n\n5  Thus, the  \"powerful and contemporaneous instruction\" referred\nto  by the  majority, ante  at 11,  was indeed  such, but  not as\n                        \nintended.   It served to  remind the jury  \"about other violence\"\nand senseless killings.  Id.\n                          \n\n Indeed,  these  studies   starkly  reveal  the  dilemma   that\nattorney's face in this area of the law.  They must choose either\nto ask for a  curative instruction, increasing the impact  of the\nimproper argument  or evidence, or  remain silent, in  which case\nthey  waive the issue on appeal, see United States v. Tejeda, 974\n                                                          \nF.2d 210, 215 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                             -22-\n\nMoreno, with  regard to  charges  that he  illegally possessed  a\n                                       \n\nloaded  sawed-off  shotgun.    This is  claimed  to  be  evidence\n                        \n\nunrelated to Moreno's character or propensity to commit crime and\n\nthus admissible  for  nebulous \"other  purposes.\"   Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b).\n\n   This is clearly improper  use of Rule 404(b).   The evidence\n\nwas not  even proof  of wrongful  acts by Moreno,  but, at  best,\n                                              \n\nevidence  of other  wrongful acts  by  third persons  in Moreno's\n                                                  \n\npresence.    Because Rule  404(b)  should  only be  invoked  when\n\nprosecutors  seek  to  introduce   evidence  of  prior  bad  acts\n\ncommitted  by the defendant, it is error to analyze this evidence\n\nunder that rule.   United States v. Moccia, 681  F.2d 61, 63 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1982)  (Breyer, C.J.) (Rule 404(b)  forbids prosecution from\n\n\"asking  the jury to  infer from the fact  that the defendant has\n                                                           \n\ncommitted  a bad act in the past, that he has a bad character and\n\ntherefore  is more  likely  to have  committed  the bad  act  now\n\ncharged\")  (emphasis added).   The proper inquiry  is whether the\n\nevidence is  relevant, and  whether it  is more  prejudicial than\n\nprobative.  The  correct answer to the first question  is no, and\n\nthe answer to the second is yes.\n\n   At  best  the  evidence   shows  mere  presence  during  the\n\ncommission of other crimes by other persons.  It asks the jury to\n                                         \n\nconclude  that appellant somehow was guilty of that crime, and by\n\nextension,  guilty  of  the  current  crime.    Appellant's  mere\n\npresence  at the  scene  of  that  crime,  of  course,  does  not\n\nestablish  appellant's guilt of that crime.  See United States v.\n                                                            \n\n                             -23-\n\nAponte-Su rez, 905 F.2d 483, 491 (1st Cir.) (mere presence at the\n           \n\nscene of a crime and  knowledge that a crime was to  be committed\n\nis  not proof of  guilt), cert. denied, 498  U.S. 990 (1990); see\n                                                               \n\nalso Nye  &amp; Nissen v.  United States, 336  U.S. 613, 619  (1949).\n                                  \n\nFurthermore, and  with all  due respect, concluding  that persons\n\npresent at the scene  of a shooting, and thereafter  fleeing, are\n\nmore likely  to be carrying weapons  is highly illogical.   It is\n\njust as likely that persons fleeing  the scene of a shooting will\n\nbe either unarmed victims or by-standers, and in fact, it is more\n\nprobable that they would have more  of an incentive to flee,  and\n\nfaster, precisely because they were unarmed.  Thus, the inference\n                                    \n\nthat it is more likely that appellant is guilty of the  felon-in-\n\npossession crime because he was fleeing from the scene of another\n\ncrime committed by other persons is insupportable.   The evidence\n\nis constitutionally and factually irrelevant.\n\n   Even if the evidence was relevant, its probative value pales\n\nin comparison  to its  prejudicial effect.   Any probative  value\n\nthat the  evidence may  have stems  from extended  inferences and\n\nspeculation about  the probabilities of  people carrying weapons.\n\nInferences and  speculation, however, are infected  too easily in\n\nthis case by the transference of guilt from the shooting of a gun\n\nby a third  party to  the charged crime  of possession,  ensuring\n\nthat a jury will  draw all doubt  against appellant.  See  United\n                                                               \n\nStates v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 602 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989)  (danger  that jury  might convict  defendant on  theory of\n\nguilt  by  association).    When  added  to  the  impact  of  the\n\n                             -24-\n\nprosecutor's  improper argument concerning senseless killings and\n\ncommunity violence, the prejudicial impact becomes manifest.  The\n\nmajority opinion chooses to ignore the prejudicial effect of this\n\nevidence,   concluding  that  the   defense  somehow  waived  any\n\nconsideration of the issue.\n\n   Lastly,  let us return to the trial itself, and consider the\n\noverall impact of these  breaches.  I have already  conceded that\n\neven without  the Rule 404(b) evidence,  appellant probably would\n\nnot  withstand a  Rule 29  motion.   The evidence  concerning the\n\ncylindrical object and  the shotgun is  perfectly valid, and  one\n\ncan conclude that  the charged  possession of a  shotgun in  fact\n\noccurred from it.   The  conclusion can only  be reached  through\n\nextended  inferences, though,  because no witness  testified that\n\nthey actually saw Moreno with the weapon, but only that he passed\n\nsomething  to someone  who  was later  found  nearby the  weapon.\n\nGiven  the  prejudice  already  infused  into the  trial  by  the\n\nimproper  argument and  evidence,  I do  not  see how  it can  be\n\ndiscounted   that  the   required   inferences  supporting   this\n\nconclusion were not themselves infected.  In all likelihood  this\n\nprejudice  would  make the  jury  more  predisposed to  draw  the\n\nrequired inferences against appellant,  thus tipping the  balance\n\nagainst him.\n\n   What we have here is a vulnerable case requiring the jury to\n\nmake substantial inferences in order to convict.  The prosecution\n\nbeefed  up  its case  by clearly  improper statements  at crucial\n\nstages of the trial, and threw in pseudo 404(b) evidence for good\n\n                             -25-\n\nmeasure.   Although the defendant did not  create this situation,\n\nhe is asked to assume  all the risks it generates.   Somehow this\n\nis not my  idea of a  fair trial.   It contradicts all logic  and\n\npractical experience.  It  is past  due  that this  court send  a\n\nclear message  regarding  the standards  that are  expected of  a\n\nlitigator whose motto is that \"[t]he United States wins its point\n\nwhenever justice  is done  its citizens  in the courts.\"   It  is\n\nbetter that this message be given in this case  than in a case of\n\nmore societal consequence.\n\n   This  appellant did not get a just  trial.  A new one should\n\nbe ordered.\n\n                             -26-\n",

On the evening of  April 18, 1991,\n\na  group of  five  law enforcement  officers,  while on  foot\n\npatrol  in the  Lenox Street  Housing Development  in Boston,\n\n                             -2-\n\nMassachusetts, heard a series of gunshots coming from another\n\narea within the development.  Three of the officers, Officers\n\nGarvey,  Perkins and  Devane,  ran in  the  direction of  the\n\nshots;  the other  two,  Officer Murphy  and Trooper  Drummy,\n\nreturned to their parked cruisers.\n\n     As the  three officers were running  down Hammond Street\n\nin  the direction  of the  shots, they  observed  three black\n\nmales,  all  wearing  black  hooded sweatshirts  or  jackets,\n\nemerge from a courtyard in the direction of the gunshots, run\n\nacross  Hammond  Street  and  disappear  near  a  cluster  of\n\nbuildings across the  street.  One of the  officers described\n\nthe  three men  as  running in  a  line in  a \"hunched  over\"\n\nmanner.   There  was  only  the  briefest interval  when  the\n\ndefendants together  disappeared from view.   Almost at once,\n\ntwo  of the three officers, joined by Officer Murphy (who had\n\nleft his cruiser to assist in the foot pursuit), saw the same\n\nthree men running through a parking lot behind the cluster of\n\nbuildings, and gave chase.  \n\n     The officers then saw one of the three men veer off from\n\nthe  other two and  run in a separate  direction.  The second\n\nand third men were then seen by the officers to come together\n\nbriefly and appeared to pass an object between them.  Officer\n\nMurphy, who was closest to the two individuals, described the\n\nitem being exchanged as a dark object about one to one-and-a-\n\nhalf feet long.  The individual who took this object then ran\n\n                             -3-\n\noff  through a grass courtyard.  The individual who passed on\n\nthe   object  immediately  stopped,   raised  his   arms  and\n\nsurrendered.   That  individual was  later identified  as the\n\ndefendant, Raymond Moreno, Jr.\n\n     Officer Garvey,  in order to  cut off any  escape route,\n\nhad  circled  around  to  the  opposite  end  of   the  grass\n\ncourtyard.   Officer Garvey soon  saw a black  male wearing a\n\nblack hooded sweatshirt enter the courtyard from  the area in\n\nwhich Moreno had just  been arrested.  After telling  the man\n\nseveral  times to  stop, Officer  Garvey saw  the man  make a\n\ngesture as if to throw an object aside, and then heard a soft\n\nthud  on the  ground  nearby.    The  man  was  arrested  and\n\nidentified as  Frederick Hardy,  who was tried  and convicted\n\nalong  with Moreno  but is  not a  party to  this appeal.   A\n\nsearch of the area  revealed a .32 caliber pistol  about five\n\nto  eight feet from where Hardy stopped and made the throwing\n\ngesture.\n\n     When arrested,  Hardy was not in possession of the foot-\n\nlong  object  that the  officers  had seen  him  receive from\n\nMoreno.  The officers then searched the path between the area\n\nof Moreno's arrest and the spot at which Officer Garvey first\n\nobserved Hardy.   Hidden in bushes  along that direct  route,\n\nthe officers found a double-barrelled sawed-off  shotgun with\n\na 12  1/2 inch barrel, fully loaded with ammunition.  This is\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe firearm and  ammunition which Moreno  is charged in  this\n\ncase with having possessed.\n\n     While  Moreno and  Hardy  were being  arrested,  Officer\n\nDevane was  in search of the first  of the three runners, who\n\nhad  gone  off  in  a separate  direction.    Officer  Devane\n\ndiscovered  a black  male,  sweating and  out  of breath  and\n\nwearing  a black  hooded sweatshirt,  hiding in  some bushes.\n\nAfter arresting the individual and placing him  in a cruiser,\n\nOfficer Devane  found a  semi-automatic pistol on  the ground\n\nnear where the individual had been hiding.  The pistol was in\n\nthe  lock-back position, smelled of gunpowder, and was out of\n\nammunition, indicating  that it recently had been discharged.\n\nThe arrested individual was identified as Steven Fernandes.\n\n     Several officers  then went back to  a central courtyard\n\nin  the  middle  of  the  Lenox  Housing  Development.   This\n\ncourtyard was in the general area of the gunshots, and it was\n\nimmediately accessible from the spot where the three arrested\n\nmen were first observed  by the officers.  In  the courtyard,\n\nthe officers found discharged cartridge casings.  These spent\n\ncasings were  matched by  a ballistics expert  to the  pistol\n\nthat was found next to Stephen Fernandes.\n\n     At the  police station  after his arrest,  Moreno, after\n\nreceiving his Miranda warning, denied knowing either Hardy or\n                     \n\nFernandes.  He claimed that he had been standing alone in the\n\nhousing development when he  heard shots and started running.\n\n                             -5-\n\nAt  trial, however,  a  resident of  the housing  development\n\ntestified that  he had  seen Moreno together  with Hardy  and\n\nFernandes  a number  of  times  over  the  prior  year.    In\n\naddition, Officer Dreary of  the Boston Police testified that\n\nin March 1991 he stopped a  red Isuzu Trooper; Hardy was  the\n\ndriver and Moreno was a passenger in the front seat.\n\n     We  think  a reasonable  jury  could  conclude beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt from this evidence that Moreno possessed the\n\nsawed-off  shotgun  and  its  ammunition.    Officer  Perkins\n\ntestified that he \"saw [the two men] meet and . . . could see\n\nthem  having some  kind of  exchange,\" but  he was  not close\n\nenough  to describe  the  object.   Officer  Murphy, who  was\n\ncloser to the men, did observe the object--which he described\n\nas \"about a foot and a half [long]\" and \"dark  in color.\"  It\n\nwas  found directly in the path Hardy took after the exchange\n\nwith  Moreno, prior  to his  apprehension by  Officer Garvey.\n\nOnce the police testimony  is credited, Moreno is effectively\n\ntied to the loaded shotgun.  \n\n     The direct evidence as to the  shotgun was reinforced by\n\nother  evidence.   First,  Moreno  and  the individuals  seen\n\nrunning away were  fleeing from  an area in  which shots  had\n\nbeen fired--shots that the jury could infer had been fired by\n\none of  the group, since  a pistol  belonging to  one of  the\n\nthree  matched  shell  casings  found  in  the  area  of  the\n\ngunshots.  Second,  Moreno's false denial after his arrest of\n\n                             -6-\n\na  prior relationship  with  Hardy and  Fernandes suggests  a\n\nguilty  mind and helps rebut any inference that he was merely\n\nin wrong place at wrong time.  The direct evidence, bolstered\n\nby  these  secondary  inferences,  was more  than  enough  to\n\nsupport the jury's verdict.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Next, Moreno argues that the trial court committed error\n\nby  allowing  the government  to  introduce  evidence of  the\n\ngunshots heard  by the officers prior to Moreno's arrest, the\n\nsemi-automatic  pistol found  with  Fernandes and  the  spent\n\nshell casings matching that  pistol.  Describing the evidence\n\nas proof of \"other crimes\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), Moreno\n\nargues that this  evidence related only  to his character  or\n\npropensity  to commit  crime  rather than  to any  legitimate\n\nissue in the  case.   Rule 404(b) provides  that evidence  of\n\n\"other crimes,  wrongs or  acts\" is  not admissible to  prove\n\n\"the  character  of  a person  in  order  to  show action  in\n\nconformity  therewith.\"   Such  evidence  is not  prohibited,\n\nhowever,  if  offered for  \"other purposes.\"   Fed.  R. Evid.\n\n404(b).  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n     In this case, the government's evidence of the gunshots,\n\nFernandes' pistol, the matching spent ammunition, and Hardy's\n\nweapon  supports a  chain  of inferences  independent of  any\n\ntendency of the evidence to show bad character.  The evidence\n\n                             -7-\n\npermits the  inference that Fernandes, with  Hardy and Moreno\n\nin   attendance,  was  the   individual  who  discharged  the\n\ngunshots, and that  the three men were  running together from\n\nthe  scene of  that  discharge  when  first observed  by  the\n\nofficers.  In turn,  the facts that Fernandes and  Hardy were\n\narmed  and that  the  three men  were fleeing  together after\n\nFernandes had  discharged three rounds of  ammunition made it\n\nsomewhat  more likely that the object Moreno was seen to pass\n\nalong  to Hardy  was indeed  the shotgun later  found nearby.\n\nSee, e.g., United  States v.

If a defendant were charged with shooting a guard\n\nin  the  course  of  a  bank  robbery,  it  would  surely  be\n\npermissible to show that he was caught fleeing from the scene\n\nof  a  just-robbed  bank  with  two other  persons  who  both\n\npossessed weapons.   The  defendant could certainly  argue to\n\nthe  jury that he was  an innocent bystander  who was fleeing\n\nfrom a dangerous scene.

If the  other evidence included  some eyewitness\n\ntestimony  that the defendant had run with the others and had\n\nappeared to be carrying a weapon,  the facts would not be far\n\nfrom our case.\n\n     Indeed, not  only are  the gun  shots and  other weapons\n\nrelevant  to the  government's  case against  Moreno but  the\n\nordinary  risks   presented  by  Rule  404(b)   evidence  are\n\nespecially tame in this  case.  The hand-guns were  not found\n\nwith  Moreno but with other defendants and the gun shots were\n\napparently fired by Fernandes.   In other words  the evidence\n\nsuggested \"other crimes\"  not by Moreno but by  Fernandes and\n\nHardy.  The usual taint  of \"other crimes\" evidence--the risk\n\nthat the jury will think  the defendant a bad man  because he\n\ncommitted other crimes--was, so  far as it threatened Moreno,\n\nlargely  absent.    If  the  jury  otherwise  thought him  an\n\ninnocent  bystander, it had no reason to attribute to him the\n\ncrimes of Fernandes and Hardy.\n\n     Of course, if the jury accepted the officers' testimony,\n\nit could conclude that Moreno was  not a bystander innocently\n\nfleeing  from danger but rather was associated with the other\n\ndefendants,  had run with them, had handed off his own weapon\n                         \n\nto Hardy, and had after his arrest falsely denied knowing the\n\nother two.   If so,  the evidence of  gunshots furnished  the\n\noccasion and context for the flight by all  three defendants;\n\nand  the  weapons possessed  by the  other  two made  it more\n\n                             -9-\n\nlikely, if only slightly, that Moreno too might be armed.  At\n\nleast the  jury  was entitled  to  consider the  evidence  of\n\ngunshots and  other weapons  and draw  such inferences  if it\n\nchose to do so. \n\n     In  short,  the evidence  was  clearly  admissible on  a\n\ntheory entirely  separate from any  light it might  cast upon\n\nMoreno's \"character.\"  Whether the relevance of such evidence\n\nis substantially  outweighed by  its prejudicial effect  is a\n\njudgment  largely within  the broad  discretion of  the trial\n\njudge.

When\n\nobjection was made,  at the end of the  prosecutor's opening,\n\nthe trial judge forcefully cautioned the jury:\n\n     I must give you some instructions to disregard some\n     of  the  things  that  were  said  in  the  opening\n     statement.   There were  references to  violence in\n     the area, to other incidents in the area than those\n     that  are the subject matter of this trial.  I will\n     instruct you to disregard  all of those references.\n     Some were made very early in the opening statement,\n     others were made in the course of it and toward the\n\n                             -11-\n\n     end of the opening  statement.

Those are  not\n     matters to  be considered by  you as you  weigh and\n     evaluate the evidence that relates to this case.\n\nWe think that  this powerful and  contemporaneous instruction\n\nwas  adequate   to  dispel   any  prejudice  caused   by  the\n\nprosecutor's remarks.

In the\n\ncourse of arguing that  the shotgun was not just  tossed away\n\nbut   deliberately   concealed,  the   prosecutor--apparently\n\ncarried away--continued:   \"Forget about the  fact that maybe\n\nMr.  Hooker [who lived nearby] or  his wife or his three kids\n\nmight come  out and look at the gun and get their heads blown\n\noff.\"   The court then  gave a lengthy  curative instruction,\n\nand the case  proceeded.  The curative instruction was rather\n\noblique  on this  issue  but  it  was  lengthy,  and  we  are\n\n                             -12-\n\nsatisfied  that the jury got  the message to  ignore what had\n\njust been said.2\n\n     If  we thought  that this  second foray  was deliberate,\n\nthere might  well be a basis for  reversal as a deterrent for\n\nthe  future, see United States  v. Capone, 683  582, 586 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1982), even though this remark  did not directly relate\n\nto  Moreno for nothing in  the evidence suggested that Moreno\n\nhad carelessly concealed the weapon  where Mr. Hooker or  his\n\nfamily  might find it; that was the act of another defendant.\n\nIn context, however, the  prosecutor's remark does not appear\n\nto have been  a deliberate disregard of the  court's earlier,\n\nimplied warning.  Rather,  although improper it was seemingly\n\na  sudden  expression of  indignation  at the  tail-end  of a\n\nlegitimate larger point.  \n\n     Finally,  in  appraising possible  prejudice, we  do not\n\nignore the fact that the case  against Moreno was ample.   As\n\nwe  said in Giry, 818  F.2d at 133,  \"prejudice that survives\n                \n\nthe charge is deemed less likely to have affected the outcome\n\nof the trial where strong evidence supports the prosecution's\n\ncase\".  Here, both  judges who join in this  majority opinion\n\nhave  independently reviewed  the  transcripts  of the  trial\n\ntestimony in this case,  in addition to the briefs;  and both\n\n                    \n\n     2The judge was, at the same time, cautioning the jury to\ngive  no  weight to  any personal  opinions expressed  by the\nprosecutor, then  or earlier.  After  completing the curative\ninstruction, the  judge gave  the lawyers the  opportunity to\nask for more, and neither requested any addition.\n\n                             -13-\n\nare satisfied that the  case against Moreno was  quite strong\n\nand that the  objectionable remarks, in context and  in light\n\nof  the instructions given by the trial judge, would not have\n\nswayed the jury.\n\n     As  the  evidence  already  recited  shows,  Moreno  was\n\ndirectly identified  by two  police officers as  running from\n\nthe area after gunshots.  He was seen by one  of the officers\n\nto hand  over a  foot-long object  to a  second man, and  the\n\nsawed-off shotgun in question  was found near the path  where\n\nthe  third one had run shortly before he too was apprehended.\n\nThis  evidence was  coupled with  other evidence  showing the\n\npossession of  weapons by  Moreno's companions, their  flight\n\ntogether with  Moreno, and Moreno's denials that  he knew the\n\nother  two--denials  proved  to  be false  by  two  different\n\nwitnesses.\n\n     The trial of this  relatively simple case stretched over\n\n10 days.  The  trial time was devoted entirely  to government\n\nevidence, since the defendants  did not testify and presented\n\nno  witnesses of  their  own.    The  government  put  on  21\n\nwitnesses, including  five officers  who were present  at the\n\ntime that Moreno was pursued and whose key testimony has been\n\nsummarized  above.  We also note that, although this does not\n\nexcuse  the  government's  missteps,  defense   counsel  made\n\narguments  before the  jury that  were not  beyond criticism,\n\nincluding cross-examination  inappropriately injecting racial\n\n                             -14-\n\nissues  into the  case.   In sum,  the government's  case was\n\nsubstantial and the imperfections in counsel's  rhetoric were\n\nnot all on one side.     On  balance,  we are  convinced that\n\nthe prosecutor's missteps  did not deprive  Moreno of a  fair\n\ntrial or a  just outcome.  The  prosecutor's improper remarks\n\nwere by  and large aberrations, met  by prompt countervailing\n\ninstructions, in  a 10-day trial that  was otherwise consumed\n\nby a detailed  exposition of  the events of  April 18,  1991.\n\nThis court has found  that even more objectionable statements\n\nby prosecutors  did not  warrant reversal where  a corrective\n\ninstruction  was given, e.g., Giry, 818 F.2d at 120 (argument\n                                  \n\ncomparing charged  drug offenses  to an \"agree[ment]  to kill\n\nthe judge\"), or no  timely objection was made,   e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Trials, to  be sure,  are hard  fought\n\ncontests  where not  every remark  can be  carefully weighed.\n\nBut for the government  in a criminal case, fairness  is more\n\nimportant than victory.

Compounding this problem is  the fact\n\nthat Rule  404(b)  and  the harmless  error  doctrine  have  been\n\nconverted, not to  say subverted,  into a wall  behind which  the\n\nGovernment apparently can continue ad infinitum to take pot shots\n                                             \n\nwith impunity.\n\n                             -16-\n\n   I register my  protest because our  past cautions, timid  as\n\nthey were, see, e.g., Agudelo, slip op. at 6 n.7 (\"this is not to\n                           \n\nforget our complaint . . . about giving  the government two bites\n\nat the apple:  push for evidence believed to be damning, and then\n\nsay it was meaningless\");  Williams, slip op. at 8-9  (\"to infect\n                                 \n\nand  jeopardize a  prosecution with  such evidence is  unwise and\n\nunjustifiable\"),  have  not only  been  ignored,  but alas,  have\n\nprobably  encouraged this  continued conduct.    I fear  that the\n\ncurrent warning, ante at 15, although somewhat more forceful than\n                   \n\nthose  that  have come  before, is  likely  to further  erode our\n\ninstitutional credibility, if  the past is any  indication of the\n\nfuture.    More  importantly,  I believe  that  the  prosecutor's\n\nactions  in  the   present  case  unconstitutionally   prejudiced\n\nMoreno's right to a fair trial.\n\n   To  set the  trial in  proper perspective,  a review  of the\n\nfacts  is  appropriate.   Three  unidentified  persons were  seen\n\nrunning from the sound  of gunfire; at some point  thereafter one\n\nof  these persons appeared to pass a one to one-and-one-half foot\n                        \n\nlong dark object  to another person who kept on  running with the\n\nunknown object; the passer then stopped running, was arrested (we\n\nknow  not for  what  crime at  this  point), and  eventually  was\n\nidentified  as Moreno;  a  person later  identified as  Frederick\n\nHardy,  the receiver of  the unknown object,  was intercepted and\n\narrested coming  from where Moreno  was detained; Hardy  was seen\n\nthrowing  away  an object,  which was  later recovered  and which\n\nturned out  to be a .32 caliber pistol; no other weapon was found\n\n                             -17-\n\non or near Hardy, but a search of his suspected  route revealed a\n\nloaded, double  barrel, sawed off  shotgun, hidden in  the bushes\n\nalong the  direct  path  from  where Moreno  was  arrested;  this\n\nshotgun and its ammunition  are the weapons with which  Moreno is\n\ncharged with illegally possessing.  \n\n   At trial, the prosecutor  introduced as Rule 404(b) evidence\n\nagainst Moreno a third  weapon found elsewhere in  the possession\n                                            \n\nof a  third individual, Stephen Fern ndes.   This weapon was  a 9\n         \n\nmm. caliber pistol, as well as 10 casings fired from  that weapon\n\nat the scene of the original shooting.\n\n   The prosecutor  also  made improper  statements, which  fall\n\ninto three groups, at different points.  First,     he     linked\n\nappellant to the  rampant violence in the community, insisting at\n\nopening argument that \"the evidence  will show that [the  police]\n\nwere doing  their jobs  protecting the  community  that has  been\n\nplagued by violence, senseless violence, shootings and killings.\"\n\nHe continued \"[t]hat's why  they were there and that's  why we're\n\nhere  today.\"  The prosecutor referred to the officers as members\n\nof an anti-gang unit  on four occasions, and instructed  the jury\n\nnot  to \"reward\"  the  defendants for  discarding  weapons.   The\n\nprosecutor injected violence at  every opportunity, stating,  for\n\nexample,  that  \"[i]f you're  walking  down  the  street  with  a\n\nbaseball  bat, it's not  illegal to possess  it.

Somebody  does\n\nthat for a reason.   Just remember that these  three people armed\n\nthemselves with three guns.\"  The prosecutor proceeded \"[a]ll you\n\nhad  to do  was pull  the trigger.   Think  about going  into the\n\nmiddle  of  that housing  development  armed  with those  weapons\n\ntogether and firing one of these weapons.\"  \n\n   Second, the prosecutor improperly vouched for the government\n\nwitnesses, intimating that they possessed some information beyond\n\nthe evidence  presented.  In discussing  the \"cylindrical object\"\n\nthat appellant  passed on  to another individual,  the prosecutor\n\nwarranted  that the  police \"knew  what it  was, but  they're not\n\noverstating  their testimony.\"   He  later asserted  \"[t]hey knew\n\nwhat the object was.  They were going to find it.\"\n\n   Third,   the  prosecutor   urged  the   jury  to   disregard\n\nappellant's counsel  because defense  attorneys \"are paid  to see\n\nsee  [sic]  things  in  a   different  way.\"    Furthermore,  the\n\nprosecutor  contended  at  one  point that  defense  counsel  was\n\n\"talking  out of  both  sides of  his  mouth.\"   The  prosecutor,\n\ndiscussing a defense argument, explained \"I'm not quite sure what\n\nthat meant, but I would suggest that a part of it was designed to\n\ndivert your attention.\"   \n\n   As  the  majority points  out,  the  prosecution's statement\n\nappealing  to  the  jury's  fear  of  neighborhood  violence  was\n\n\"patently  improper\"  and  \"outside  the  bounds  of   legitimate\n\n                             -19-\n\nargument and cannot be condoned.\"  Id. at pp. 10-11.   \"[N]o less\n                                    \n\ndisturbing,\"  finds  the majority,  is  that  \"even after  [being\n\nwarned]  the  prosecutor again  departed  from  the straight  and\n\nnarrow  in  his closing.\"    Id. at  12.

Even more troublesome\n                        \n\nto  a criminal  defendant  in Moreno's  position are  the studies\n\nindicating  that  juries   tend  to  forget  the  source  of  the\n\ninformation they remember, and are often unable to recall whether\n\nthe source of information came from a witness, or from one of the\n\nattorneys during the opening statement or  closing argument.

These studies  also show that  juries treat  statements\n\nmade  by counsel  in opening  statements as  fact even  though no\n\nevidence is later introduced to support the attorney's assertion.\n\nId.  Harmful impact  may also result from improper remarks  in an\n \n\nopening statement, caused by  a psychological phenomenon known as\n\nthe  \"primacy effect,\" which is a tendency to make snap judgments\n\nbased on information presented early  in the trial.

The studies\n\n                             -21-\n\ndiscussed  above clearly  demonstrate a  common sense  conclusion\n\nwith empirical data:  the  prejudicial influence of such argument\n\nand  evidence should not be  easily disregarded in  the manner we\n\nhave done,  as it flows more  deeply than we have  assumed.5  The\n\nstudies lead  to  one inescapable  conclusion in  regard to  this\n\ncase:  there is no way of knowing if the stricken remarks were in\n\nfact  not influential in prejudicing  the jury in  a powerful and\n\nlasting way, and thus tipping the balance against him.\n\n   To this prejudice  we add the impact on the  jury of the so-\n\ncalled 404(b) evidence.  This evidence proffered under the  aegis\n\nof this rule consisted of:  (1) testimony that pistol shots fired\n                                                   \n\nby  unknown  persons  were  heard  by  police  officers prior  to\n         \n\nMoreno's arrest; (2) a 9 mm. caliber pistol that was found on the\n                                         \n\nground near another individual; and  (3) ten spent shell  casings\n                 \n\nmatching  that pistol,  which  were found  near  area from  which\n                   \n\nMoreno and three other men were seen running from after the shots\n\nwere heard.  As noted, supra at 15, the 9 mm. pistol was found in\n                          \n\npossession of a third person, Stephen Fern ndes, who was not even\n\ntried  together with appellant.  All this evidence was allowed as\n\nprobative  in establishing  \"other  crimes, wrongs  or acts,\"  by\n                                                               \n\n                  \n\n5  Thus, the  \"powerful and contemporaneous instruction\" referred\nto  by the  majority, ante  at 11,  was indeed  such, but  not as\n                        \nintended.   It served to  remind the jury  \"about other violence\"\nand senseless killings.  Id.\n                          \n\n Indeed,  these  studies   starkly  reveal  the  dilemma   that\nattorney's face in this area of the law.  They must choose either\nto ask for a  curative instruction, increasing the impact  of the\nimproper argument  or evidence, or  remain silent, in  which case\nthey  waive the issue on appeal, see United States v.

This is  claimed  to  be  evidence\n                        \n\nunrelated to Moreno's character or propensity to commit crime and\n\nthus admissible  for  nebulous \"other  purposes.\"   Fed. R.

It is\n\njust as likely that persons fleeing  the scene of a shooting will\n\nbe either unarmed victims or by-standers, and in fact, it is more\n\nprobable that they would have more  of an incentive to flee,  and\n\nfaster, precisely because they were unarmed.  Thus, the inference\n                                    \n\nthat it is more likely that appellant is guilty of the  felon-in-\n\npossession crime because he was fleeing from the scene of another\n\ncrime committed by other persons is insupportable.   The evidence\n\nis constitutionally and factually irrelevant.\n\n   Even if the evidence was relevant, its probative value pales\n\nin comparison  to its  prejudicial effect.   Any probative  value\n\nthat the  evidence may  have stems  from extended  inferences and\n\nspeculation about  the probabilities of  people carrying weapons.\n\nInferences and  speculation, however, are infected  too easily in\n\nthis case by the transference of guilt from the shooting of a gun\n\nby a third  party to  the charged crime  of possession,  ensuring\n\nthat a jury will  draw all doubt  against appellant.  See  United\n                                                               \n\nStates v.

When  added  to  the  impact  of  the\n\n                             -24-\n\nprosecutor's  improper argument concerning senseless killings and\n\ncommunity violence, the prejudicial impact becomes manifest.  The\n\nmajority opinion chooses to ignore the prejudicial effect of this\n\nevidence,   concluding  that  the   defense  somehow  waived  any\n\nconsideration of the issue.\n\n   Lastly,  let us return to the trial itself, and consider the\n\noverall impact of these  breaches.  I have already  conceded that\n\neven without  the Rule 404(b) evidence,  appellant probably would\n\nnot  withstand a  Rule 29  motion.   The evidence  concerning the\n\ncylindrical object and  the shotgun is  perfectly valid, and  one\n\ncan conclude that  the charged  possession of a  shotgun in  fact\n\noccurred from it.   The  conclusion can only  be reached  through\n\nextended  inferences, though,  because no witness  testified that\n\nthey actually saw Moreno with the weapon, but only that he passed\n\nsomething  to someone  who  was later  found  nearby the  weapon.\n\nGiven  the  prejudice  already  infused  into the  trial  by  the\n\nimproper  argument and  evidence,  I do  not  see how  it can  be\n\ndiscounted   that  the   required   inferences  supporting   this\n\nconclusion were not themselves infected.  In all likelihood  this\n\nprejudice  would  make the  jury  more  predisposed to  draw  the\n\nrequired inferences against appellant,  thus tipping the  balance\n\nagainst him.\n\n   What we have here is a vulnerable case requiring the jury to\n\nmake substantial inferences in order to convict.  The prosecution\n\nbeefed  up  its case  by clearly  improper statements  at crucial\n\nstages of the trial, and threw in pseudo 404(b) evidence for good\n\n                             -25-\n\nmeasure.   Although the defendant did not  create this situation,\n\nhe is asked to assume  all the risks it generates.   Somehow this\n\nis not my  idea of a  fair trial.   It contradicts all logic  and\n\npractical experience.  It  is past  due  that this  court send  a\n\nclear message  regarding  the standards  that are  expected of  a\n\nlitigator whose motto is that \"[t]he United States wins its point\n\nwhenever justice  is done  its citizens  in the courts.\"   It  is\n\nbetter that this message be given in this case  than in a case of\n\nmore societal consequence.\n\n   This  appellant did not get a just  trial.  A new one should\n\nbe ordered.\n\n                             -26-\n</pre>",
