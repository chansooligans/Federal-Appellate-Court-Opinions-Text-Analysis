Reimer, Diego A. Ramos, Fiddler González &\nRodríguez, PSC, Stephen S. Young, and Holland & Knight LLP, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                           December 28, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              PER CURIAM.          In this copyright case, plaintiff Latin\n\nAmerican Music Company (\"LAMCO\") has filed its second motion for\n\nreconsideration of an order awarding attorneys' fees incurred on\n\nappeal in favor of defendant American Society of Composers, Authors\n\nand Publishers (\"ASCAP\").             Once again the motion is denied.\n\n              We begin with a brief sketch of the relevant background.1\n\nAs a result of its success defending a favorable jury verdict,\n\nASCAP applied for attorneys' fees incurred on appeal.                              LAMCO,\n\nhowever, failed to respond within the time set by our local rules.\n\nSee   First     Circuit       Local   Rule     39.1(b)      (requiring     response    to\n\napplication for attorneys' fees within thirty days).                       We carefully\n\nreviewed ASCAP's application, and, after an additional month had\n\npassed without response, we granted the application and awarded\n\nASCAP $89,327.52. Ten days after our order entered, LAMCO filed an\n\nobjection       to    ASCAP's      application        styled      as   a   motion     for\n\nreconsideration.          LAMCO attributed its tardiness to an \"office\n\nerror,\"      and     raised    a   host   of   issues       challenging     the    award,\n\nincluding (1) ASCAP's status as a prevailing party, (2) whether\n\nASCAP       registered    the      disputed        song,2   and    (3)     the    overall\n\nreasonableness of the award.              We reexamined ASCAP's application in\n\n\n        1\n      For further background, see Latin Am. Music Co. v. Am.\nSociety of Composers Authors and Publishers, 593 F.3d 95 (1st Cir.\n2010), and Latin Am. Music Co. v. Archdiocese, 499 F.3d 32 (1st\nCir. 2007).\n      2\n      \"Caballo Viejo,\" or \"Old Horse,\" a popular folk song in\nVenezuela.\n\n                                             -2-\n\flight of LAMCO's untimely arguments, but ultimately concluded that\n\nthe award should stand.     Accordingly, we denied LAMCO's motion.\n\n          The present motion covers little new ground.            LAMCO\n\nparrots the same excuse for its late objection, incorporates its\n\nearlier arguments against an award, and adds an alternate argument\n\nthat, if we still think that attorneys' fees are appropriate, we\n\nshould remand to the district court \"for the proper determination\n\nof the award.\"     ASCAP counters that LAMCO's arguments lack merit\n\nand cross-moves for sanctions on the basis of LAMCO's repeated\n\nattempts to revisit the award.    See First Circuit Local Rule 38.0\n\n(providing   for   \"appropriate   sanctions\"   in   appeals   involving\n\nvexatious tactics).\n\n          The Copyright Act of 1976 permits courts, in their\n\ndiscretion, to award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing\n\nparty.   § 101, 17 U.S.C. § 505 (2006); Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,\n\n510 U.S. 517, 535 (1994).      A \"prevailing party\" is one who has\n\n\"prevailed on the merits of at least some claims,\" Torres-Negron v.\n\nJ & N Records, LLC, 504 F.3d 151, 164 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. Va. Dep't of Health & Human\n\nRes., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)), no matter whether he be a\n\nplaintiff or a defendant.    See Fogerty, 510 U.S. at 535 (involving\n\nprevailing defendant).    A showing of frivolity or bad faith is not\n\nrequired; rather, the prevailing party need only show that its\n\nopponent's copyright claims or defenses were \"objectively weak.\"\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fGarcia-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           We quickly dispense with LAMCO's arguments. First, there\n\nis no serious question that ASCAP prevailed on the merits of\n\nLAMCO's copyright claims.            ASCAP was therefore a prevailing party\n\nfor purposes of § 505, and we chose, based on our discretion and\n\nthe weakness of LAMCO's claims, to award fees.                   Second, LAMCO's\n\nargument that fees are barred because ASCAP failed to timely\n\nregister   the     disputed     song     was    fatally   underdeveloped,     and\n\ntherefore waived.       United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).      Third, LAMCO's challenge to the reasonableness of the\n\naward was undermined, if not forfeited, by its own neglect.                   Its\n\nobjection was filed thirty-nine days late (a full ten days after we\n\nentered    the     order     granting     ASCAP's      application),    and   its\n\nexplanation for the late filing lacked the detail and support one\n\nwould expect under the circumstances.                 See, e.g., First Circuit\n\nLocal   Rule     27(a)(2)(B)(i)       (requiring    submission    of   affidavits\n\nnecessary to support factual assertions in motions).\n\n           Finally,        LAMCO's    request   for    remand   is   unwarranted.\n\nAlthough not appropriate in every case, we can award fees incurred\n\non appeal where, as here, the prevailing party has submitted\n\nrecords that establish the reasonableness of the award. See, e.g.,\n\nGamma Audio & Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea, 11 F.3d 1106, 1119 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (\"under § 505 . . . this court may make an award of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fattorney's fees to the prevailing party for services rendered on\n\nappeal\");    4   Melville   B.   Nimmer     and   David   Nimmer,   Nimmer   on\n\nCopyright § 14.10[E] at 14-242 (rev. ed. 2010) (\"when the court of\n\nappeals is in possession of detailed billing records, it may handle\n\nthe entire award\"); see also Poy v. Boutelis, 92 Fed. App'x 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam) (awarding attorneys' fees incurred on\n\nappeal    when   prevailing   party   submitted     \"billing   ledger   pages\n\ndetailing the dates, time spent, and subject matter of counsel's\n\nwork\").\n\n            LAMCO's motion for reconsideration is denied.\n\n            ASCAP's cross-motion for sanctions is denied.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
