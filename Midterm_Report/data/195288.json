We address  in this  case\n                                   \n\nwhether  the   civil  enforcement  provisions  of   the  Employee\n\nRetirement  Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29  U.S.C.   1132(a) -\n\n(l),  provide for  equitable  relief against  a nonfiduciary  who\n\nknowingly participates in a fiduciary  breach.  This issue  comes\n\nto  us in  the  shadow of  a recent  United States  Supreme Court\n\nopinion, Mertens v.  Hewitt Associates, 113  S. Ct. 2063  (1993),\n                                      \n\nwhich   addressed   the   availability   of    remedies   against\n\nnonfiduciaries under  ERISA and concluded, albeit  only in dicta,\n\nthat no cause of action like the one brought in this case exists.\n\nId. at 2067.   After conducting our own analysis of  the statute,\n  \n\nwe find that, although ERISA may allow for some types of  actions\n\nagainst nonfiduciaries,  it  does  not  authorize  suits  against\n\nnonfiduciaries charged solely with  participating in a  fiduciary\n\nbreach.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The genesis of this appeal was a lawsuit brought by the\n\nUnited States Secretary  of Labor (the \"Secretary\")  on March 11,\n\n1991,  against  several   corporate  and  individual   defendants\n\ninvolved  in the  failed OMNI  Medical Health  and Welfare  Trust\n\n(\"OMNI\").   In the complaint,  the Secretary alleged  a number of\n\nERISA   violations  in   relation  to   OMNI's  failure   to  pay\n\napproximately two to three million dollars in medical benefits to\n\neligible employees of companies  participating in the OMNI health\n\nplan.    The Secretary  also  contended that  appellee,  H. James\n\nGorman,  Jr.  (\"Gorman\"),  a  financial  consultant  who provided\n\n                               -2-\n\nprofessional  services to  OMNI,  knowingly  participated in  the\n\nfiduciary  breaches of  several  of OMNI's  administrators.   The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the action against Gorman for failure to\n\nstate a claim under ERISA and the Secretary brought this appeal.\n\n          We   accept  all   the   factual  allegations   in  the\n\nSecretary's  complaint as  true in  order to review  the district\n\ncourt's  dismissal  under  Rule  12(b)(6).    Garita  Hotel  Ltd.\n                                                                 \n\nPartnership v. Ponce Federal  Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15,  17 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1992).\n\n          Between  1986  and 1990,  OMNI provided  group medical,\n\ndental,  and life  insurance and  other benefits  to a  number of\n\nsmall,  unrelated  business  employers  in  Massachusetts.    The\n\nemployers  participating in  OMNI  established  employee  welfare\n\nbenefit plans (the \"welfare plans\") within the meaning of ERISA  \n\n3(1),  29  U.S.C.    1003(1).   By  collecting premiums  from the\n\nparticipating employers,  OMNI held and controlled  the assets of\n\nthe  welfare plans and was responsible for paying benefits to the\n\nemployees.\n\n          The  Secretary  claimed that  OMNI  falsely represented\n\nitself  to be  a \"tax-exempt  ERISA covered  benefit plan\"  under\n\nERISA   3(1), 29 U.S.C.   1002(1), in order to avoid governmental\n\nregulation and oversight.  According to the Secretary, OMNI was a\n\nmultiple employer welfare arrangement (\"MEWA\") within the meaning\n\nof ERISA   3(40)(a),  29 U.S.C.   1002(40)(a),  but not an  ERISA\n\nplan exempt from state insurance regulation.\n\n          Count I  of the  complaint alleged that  Harbor Medical\n\n                               -3-\n\nAdministrators,  Inc. (\"HMA\"),  the  administrator  of OMNI,  and\n\nHMA's President (Mr. Richard Rowe), Executive Vice-President (Mr.\n\nPhillip  Carpenter) and Vice President (Ms.  Ann Dunlop) acted as\n\nfiduciaries with respect  to the employers'  welfare plans.   The\n\nSecretary  asserted that  these  four defendants  breached  their\n\nfiduciary  obligations under  ERISA by  engaging in a  variety of\n\nimprudent and self-serving activities.   The activities  included\n\nengaging in  prohibited  transactions, mismanaging  and  misusing\n\nassets of the  welfare plans, falsely representing  the status of\n\nOMNI to employers and state regulators, and operating an  illegal\n\ninsurance company.\n\n          Count II of the complaint alleged that Gorman,  who was\n\nDirector of Group Insurance and Welfare Plan Consulting Services,\n\nActuarial,  Benefits   and   Compensation  Consulting,   at   the\n\naccounting  firm of  Coopers  &amp;  Lybrand, provided  \"professional\n\nservices\"  to  OMNI  from  May  through  October  of  1989.    In\n\nparticular,  he provided advice to HMA regarding the legal status\n\nof  OMNI under  ERISA.   On  several  occasions, Gorman  informed\n\nDunlop,  Rowe and  others  at HMA  that  they were  operating  an\n\nillegal insurance  company under Massachusetts law  and that OMNI\n\ndid not  enjoy the protection  of the  ERISA provision  exempting\n\nERISA  plans  from  state regulation.    See  29  U.S.C.    1144.\n                                            \n\nDespite his own warnings, Gorman advised Dunlop, in response to a\n\nletter from  the New Hampshire Insurance  Department inquiring as\n\nto the legal status of OMNI, that she had the  option to \"try the\n\n'red herring' across  the trail of the Insurance  Department just\n\n                               -4-\n\nto  keep them  off balance\"  by  telling them  OMNI was  an ERISA\n\ncovered plan.   The gist of this advice was that OMNI could avoid\n\nstate regulation  by obfuscating its  true legal status.   Gorman\n\nprovided  Dunlop with a draft letter to send to the New Hampshire\n\nInsurance  Department falsely  stating that  OMNI was  covered by\n\nERISA.   Gorman  further advised  that there  was little  risk of\n\ninvestigation by the state once it was informed of a plan's ERISA\n\nstatus.   Subsequently,  Rowe adopted  Gorman's draft  letter and\n\nsent it  to New Hampshire's  Insurance Department on  October 17,\n\n1989.\n\n          The  complaint stated  that Gorman  acted at  all times\n\n\"within  the  scope  of  his  employment\"  and  by   his  actions\n\nparticipated in the fiduciary breaches of the defendants named in\n\nCount I.   The Secretary did not allege that Gorman himself was a\n\nfiduciary.   The  Secretary concluded,  however, that  \"Gorman is\n\nliable under ERISA to the same  extent as the fiduciaries for the\n\nbreaches committed.\"   Gorman's employer, Coopers  &amp; Lybrand, was\n\nalso named as a defendant based  on the theory that it was liable\n\nfor the actions of its agent.\n\n          To  remedy the alleged violations, the Secretary sought\n\nthe  recovery   of  plan   losses,  the  undoing   of  prohibited\n\ntransactions and  a permanent injunction against  all defendants,\n\nincluding Gorman,  from serving  as ERISA fiduciaries  or service\n\nproviders to any ERISA plans.\n\n          On  September  1,  1992,  the  district  court  granted\n\nmotions to dismiss filed by Gorman and Coopers &amp; Lybrand based on\n\n                               -5-\n\nthe  failure of Count  II to state  a claim under  Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nThe district court held that neither of the two ERISA enforcement\n\nprovisions  under which  the Secretary  could proceed,  29 U.S.C.\n\n  1132(a)(2)  and     1132(a)(5),  authorized  a   claim  against\n\nnonfiduciaries like Gorman or Coopers  &amp; Lybrand.1  The  district\n\n                    \n\n1  29 U.S.C.    1132(a), entitled  \"Persons empowered to bring  a\ncivil action,\" states in its entirety:\n\n          A civil action may be brought --\n\n          (1) by a participant or beneficiary --\n            (A)  for  the  relief  provided   for  in\n            subsection (c) of this subsection, or\n            (B) to  recover benefits due to him under\n            the terms  of  his plan,  to enforce  his\n            rights under the terms of the plan, or to\n            clarify  his  rights  to future  benefits\n            under the terms of the plan;\n\n          (2) by the  Secretary, or  by a  participant,\n          beneficiary  or   fiduciary  for  appropriate\n          relief under section 1109 of this title;\n\n          (3)   by   a  participant,   beneficiary,  or\n          fiduciary (A)  to enjoin any act  or practice\n          which   violates   any   provision  of   this\n          subchapter or  the terms of the  plan, or (B)\n          to obtain other appropriate  equitable relief\n          (i) to  redress  such violation  or  (ii)  to\n          enforce any provisions of this  subchapter or\n          the terms of the plan;\n\n          (4) by the Secretary  or by a participant, or\n          beneficiary  for  appropriate  relief in  the\n          case of a violation of 1025(c) of this title;\n\n          (5)   except   as   otherwise   provided   in\n          subsection  (b)  of   this  section,  by  the\n          Secretary (A)  to enjoin any act  or practice\n          which   violates   any   provision  of   this\n          subchapter,   or   (B)   to    obtain   other\n          appropriate equitable relief  (i) to  redress\n          such  violation  or   (ii)  to  enforce   any\n          provisions of this subchapter; or\n\n          (6)  by the  Secretary to  collect any  civil\n\n                               -6-\n\ncourt found  that the  Secretary  could not  obtain relief  under\n\n  1132(a)(5) because  that section  applies only  to nonfiduciary\n\ndefendants who  are \"parties in  interest.\"2  The  district court\n\nalso  found that no cause  of action existed  under   1132(a)(2),\n\nwhich authorizes  the Secretary to seek  appropriate relief under\n\n29 U.S.C.   1109,3  because only fiduciaries could be  sued under\n\n                    \n\n          penalty under subsection (c)(2) or (i) or (l)\n          of this section.\n\n2  A \"party in interest\" includes a \"person providing services to\n[an employee benefit]  plan.\"   29 U.S.C.    1002(14)(B).   ERISA\nprohibits  certain  transactions  between ERISA  plans  and their\nparties in interest.  29 U.S.C.   1106(a)(1).\n\n   The complaint contained no allegation that Gorman was  a party\nin   interest  nor  that   he  was  engaged   in  any  prohibited\ntransactions.   The facts stated in the complaint do suggest that\nGorman satisfies the definition of a party in interest, but there\nis no indication he  participated in any prohibited transactions.\nAlthough we do not decide whether the complaint must specifically\nallege that the nonfiduciary  defendant is a \"party in  interest\"\nin  order to state  a cause of  action under    1132(a)(5), we do\ndiscuss the importance, under  certain circumstances, of alleging\nthat  a defendant engaged in a  prohibited transaction, see infra\n                                                                 \nat pages 15, 18-19 &amp; 23-24.\n\n3  29 U.S.C.   1109(a) provides:\n\n            Any   person  who  is  a  fiduciary  with\n            respect to a plan who breaches any of the\n            responsibilities, obligations,  or duties\n            imposed   upon    fiduciaries   by   this\n            subchapter shall be personally  liable to\n            make good to such  plan any losses to the\n            plan resulting from each such breach, and\n            to restore  to such plan  any profits  of\n            such  fiduciary  which  have   been  made\n            through use of assets  of the plan by the\n            fiduciary, and  shall be subject  to such\n            other equitable or remedial relief as the\n            court  may  deem  appropriate,  including\n            removal of  such fiduciary.   A fiduciary\n            may also  be removed for  a violation  of\n            section 1111 of this title.\n\n                               -7-\n\n  1109 and neither Gorman nor Coopers &amp; Lybrand were fiduciaries.\n\n          On June 1, 1993,  the Supreme Court held  in a five  to\n\nfour decision that ERISA does  not permit a civil suit for  money\n\ndamages against  nonfiduciaries  who knowingly  participate in  a\n\nfiduciary  breach.  Mertens,  113 S. Ct.  at 2072.   The Court in\n                           \n\nMertens  found that \"appropriate equitable relief,\" as authorized\n       \n\nunder    1132(a)  (3),4  includes  only  those  types  of  relief\n\ntypically   available  in   equity,   such   as  injunctions   or\n\nrestitution.  Such  relief would  not include a  classic form  of\n\nlegal relief like  compensatory damages.  Id. at 2068.  The Court\n                                            \n\ndiscussed,  but expressly refrained  from deciding, whether ERISA\n\nprovides any  remedy at all  for nonfiduciary participation  in a\n\nfiduciary breach.  Id. at 2067-68.\n                     \n\n          After the  Mertens decision, the Secretary withdrew the\n                            \n\nappeal  of his claim against Coopers &amp; Lybrand because that claim\n\nonly sought monetary damages.   The Secretary pursued  the appeal\n\nof Gorman's  dismissal to  the extent the  Secretary was  seeking\n\nonly equitable  relief.   The four  fiduciary defendants  in this\n\ncase  defaulted leaving Gorman as the only defendant who is party\n\nto this appeal.\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\n\n          At  the  center  of this  case  is  the  language of   \n\n                    \n\n4  Section 1132(a)(3) provides for the same remedies as   1132(a)\n(5)   in  civil   actions  brought   by  an   ERISA  participant,\nbeneficiary, or fiduciary  (as opposed to actions  brought by the\nSecretary under     1132(a)(5)), and  contains  nearly  identical\nlanguage.  Because the shared language in both provisions \"should\nbe deemed to have the same meaning,\" Mertens, 113 S. Ct. at 2070,\n                                            \nmost analyses of one provision apply equally to the other.\n\n                               -8-\n\n502(a)(5)  of ERISA which states  that the Secretary  may bring a\n\ncivil action\n\n            (A) to enjoin  any act or practice  which\n            violates    any    provision   of    this\n            subchapter,  or  (B)   to  obtain   other\n            appropriate   equitable  relief   (i)  to\n            redress such violation or (ii) to enforce\n            any provision of this subchapter.\n\nThe  Secretary  maintains  that  its action  against  Gorman  for\n\nalleged  participation  in  the  fiduciary  breaches   of  OMNI's\n\nadministrators  constitutes  a claim  for  \"appropriate equitable\n\nrelief to redress\" violations of ERISA or \"to enforce\" provisions\n\nof ERISA  under   1132(a)(B).5   According to the  Secretary, the\n\nlanguage of the  provision does not  explicitly require that  the\n\nERISA  violation must be one committed by the person against whom\n\nthe relief is sought, so long  as the relief is \"appropriate\" for\n\npurposes of \"redressing\" a violation.  See Mertens, 113 S. Ct. at\n                                                  \n\n2073 n.1 (White,  J., dissenting).  Likewise,  one could arguably\n\nbring an  action  against  a  nonfiduciary for  the  purposes  of\n\n\"enforcing\"  a provision of ERISA  which imposes no obligation on\n\nthat nonfiduciary but nevertheless  requires some judicial relief\n\nagainst the nonfiduciary in order to remain effective.\n\n          In  this  case,  the  Secretary argues  that  enjoining\n\nGorman from providing  any services to an ERISA plan  would be an\n\nappropriate way  of redressing  the breaches committed  by OMNI's\n\nadministrators  and  of preventing  subsequent  breaches by  some\n\nhypothetical group of fiduciaries  who might take Gorman's advice\n\n                    \n\n5  The Secretary does  not dispute that it has no  remedy against\nGorman under   1132(a)(2) because Gorman is not a fiduciary. \n\n                               -9-\n\nin the  future.   While  plausible,  we find  that  such a  broad\n\nreading of  this enforcement  provision is  contrary to  a common\n\nsense construction  of the ERISA  statute and to  the established\n\nrestriction on our ability to create new causes of action.\n\n          We  interpret    1132(a)(5)  to authorize  actions only\n\nagainst those who commit  violations of ERISA or who  are engaged\n\nin  an  \"act or  practice\" proscribed  by  the statute.   Section\n\n1132(a)  (5)(A)  authorizes  injunctions   against  any  \"act  or\n\npractice\" which violates ERISA,  while   1132(a)(5)(B) authorizes\n\nother  equitable remedies  for such acts  or practices.

We reject this argument  below, see\n                                                                 \ninfra  pages 21-24.

As  Justice Scalia\n\nexplained in Mertens,\n                    \n\n            no    provision    explicitly    requires\n            [nonfiduciaries]  to avoid  participation\n            (knowing or unknowing)  in a  fiduciary's\n            breach   of  fiduciary   duty.     It  is\n            unlikely,  moreover,  that  this  was  an\n            oversight,  since  ERISA does  explicitly\n                                         \n            impose \"knowing  participation\" liability\n            on  cofiduciaries.    See     405(a),  29\n            U.S.C.     1105(a).     That   limitation\n            appears all the  more deliberate in light\n            of the fact that  \"knowing participation\"\n            liability  on the part of both cotrustees\n                                          \n            and  third  persons was  well established\n               \n            under  the common law  of trusts .  . . .\n            In    Russell     we    emphasized    our\n                         \n            unwillingness to infer  causes of  action\n            in   the   ERISA   context,  since   that\n            statute's carefully  crafted and detailed\n            enforcement   scheme   provides   \"strong\n            evidence that Congress did not  intend to\n                                          \n            authorize other remedies  that it  simply\n            forgot to incorporate expressly.\"\n\nMertens, 113 S.

Kwatcher, 879 F.2d  at 965-66 (applying  federal common\n                  \n\nlaw to allow restitution  action for recovery of  overpayments to\n\nan  ERISA  pension  fund);  Malden  Mills,  971  F.2d  at  774-75\n                                         \n\n                               -14-\n\n(recognizing a  common law right to  \"restitution for overpayment\n\nof contributions by an employer to a Fund\").\n\n          All   things   considered,   judicial    remedies   for\n\nnonfiduciary participation in a  fiduciary breach fall within the\n\nline  of cases  where Congress  deliberately omitted  a potential\n\ncause  of action rather than the cases where Congress has invited\n\nthe courts to engage  in interstitial lawmaking.  To  begin with,\n\nCongress  proscribed  several  \"acts  or  practices\"  in  ERISA's\n\nsubstantive provisions  that involve  nonfiduciaries but  did not\n\ninclude among  them a  nonfiduciary's knowing participation  in a\n\nfiduciary breach.  See  Mertens, 113 S. Ct. at  2067 &amp; n.4.   For\n                               \n\nexample,  29 U.S.C.    1106(a)(1) prohibits  certain transactions\n\nbetween  \"parties  in interest,\"  see  supra, note  2,  and ERISA\n                                            \n\nplans,7  and 29  U.S.C.    1023(d)(8)  prohibits  actuaries  from\n\nbreaching their  duty to certify that  their actuarial statements\n\nare  \"complete  and accurate.\"   In  addition,  29 U.S.C.    1105\n\nimposes liability on cofiduciaries for knowingly participating in\n                                  \n\na fiduciary breach.  It is  such \"acts or practices\" as these for\n\nwhich   1132(a)(5) provides a remedy.\n\n          If  Congress desired  to augment the  existing remedies\n\nagainst fiduciary breaches, 29 U.S.C.   1109(a), by providing for\n\n                    \n\n7    The fact  that     1106 imposes  the  duty  to refrain  from\nprohibited transactions on fiduciaries and not on  the parties in\ninterest  is irrelevant  for  our purposes  because    1132(a)(5)\nreaches  \"acts or  practices\" that  violate ERISA  and prohibited\ntransactions violate    1106.   Although fiduciary  breaches also\nviolate  ERISA, nonfiduciaries cannot,  by definition,  engage in\nthe   act   or   practice   of  breaching   a   fiduciary   duty.\nNonfiduciaries,  can, however, engage  in the act  or practice of\ntransacting with an ERISA plan.\n\n                               -15-\n\nan action against nonfiduciaries for assisting those breaches, it\n\ncould have  done so with  provisions similar to  those concerning\n\ncofiduciaries and prohibited transactions.

At  the same  time,  such advice  is  particularly\n\nvulnerable  to  remedies  that  impose  liability  like  the  one\n\nrequested by  the Secretary.  We  do not mean  to countenance the\n\naction of someone  who advises a fiduciary to break  the law, but\n\nwe  are concerned that extending the threat of liability over the\n\nheads  of those  who only  lend professional  services to  a plan\n\nwithout exercising  any control  over, or transacting  with, plan\n\nassets  will  deter  such  individuals  from  helping fiduciaries\n\nnavigate the intricate financial and legal thicket of ERISA.\n\n          Congress  recognized this  danger and  was purposefully\n\ncircumspect  about  limiting  the liability  of  those  providing\n\nprofessional  services  to ERISA  plans.   See,  e.g.,  29 U.S.C.\n                                                     \n\n  1108 (b)(2) (exempting from the list of transactions prohibited\n\nunder ERISA, contracts  or arrangements with a  party in interest\n\nfor  \"legal,  accounting, or  other  services  necessary for  the\n\nestablishment or operation of the plan\").  The text of ERISA\n\n            allocates   liability  for   plan-related\n            misdeeds  in   reasonable  proportion  to\n            respective actors' power  to control  and\n            prevent the misdeeds.  . . . Professional\n            service   providers  such   as  actuaries\n            become liable for damages when they cross\n            the line from  advisor to fiduciary, [and\n            they]  must  disgorge assets  and profits\n            obtained    through    participation   as\n            parties-in-interest    in    transactions\n            prohibited by [  1106(a)] and pay related\n            civil  penalties, see   502(i), 29 U.S.C.\n\n                               -17-\n\n              1132(i) . . . .\n\nMertens, 113 S. Ct. at 2071-72.\n       \n\n          While we recognize that our decision to limit liability\n\nfor  nonfiduciaries  may  provide  less  protection than  existed\n\nbefore  ERISA  was  enacted  and  that  the decision  may  appear\n\ncontrary  to  ERISA's  purpose  of protecting  the  interests  of\n\nparticipants  and  beneficiaries,  we  also  recognize  that  the\n\npresent structure  of  ERISA was  the  outcome of  certain  cost-\n\nbenefit analyses  that Congress undertook  in order to  fashion a\n\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme.   Exposure not only to liability\n\nfor damages but to other forms of liability as well \"would impose\n\nhigh insurance  costs upon persons  who regularly  deal with  and\n\noffer  advice  to   ERISA  plans,  and  hence  upon  ERISA  plans\n\nthemselves.\"   Id.  at 2072.

Congress decided that the  best approach\n\nwas  to limit  liability for  nonfiduciaries,  especially service\n\nproviders, while  at  the  same time  increasing  the  number  of\n\nfiduciary parties and the scope of fiduciary responsibility.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMertens, 113 S.  Ct. at 2071.  We decline  to upset this decision\n       \n\nby invoking our common law authority in this case.\n\n          We  are more willing to create common law remedies that\n\n                               -18-\n\nare directed  toward undoing specific transactions  or recovering\n\nassets of an ERISA  plan.  In those  situations, the parties  are\n\nmore likely to be in control of plan assets and thus functionally\n\nmore like fiduciaries.  As we demonstrated in Kwatcher and Malden\n                                                                 \n\nMills, the provision of restitution  remedies to seek the  return\n     \n\nof  plan assets can be a  proper exercise of our common lawmaking\n\nauthority.

Instead, we  would\n\nconsider Gorman's  salary as a part  of the ERISA plan's  cost of\n\noperations.  Furthermore, the facts of this case do not present a\n\nsituation where the court  must use its equitable powers,  as the\n\nSecretary warns, \"to stop an ongoing bribery or kickback  scheme,\n\nor  [provide] restitution  and  a constructive  trust to  recover\n\nfunds  transferred  from a  plan to  a  nonfiduciary.\"   In those\n\nsituations, unlike the  present case, the  act or practice  being\n\nremedied is  either  expressly proscribed  by the  statute (by   \n\n                    \n\n8    The  Secretary  makes no  allegation  that  Gorman  received\nunreasonable compensation for his services.  If such had been the\ncase, the Secretary might have stated a cause of action  based on\nGorman's  engagement in  a  prohibited transaction,  29 U.S.C.   \n1106, but not for participation in a fiduciary breach.\n\n                               -19-\n\n1106, for  example, which prohibits certain  transactions between\n\nthe  plan and a \"party in interest\"), and thus explicitly covered\n\nunder    1132(a)(5),  or  else within  our  recognized powers  of\n\ngranting restitution.\n\n          On a somewhat different tack, the Secretary attempts to\n\ncharacterize  the suit against Gorman as merely a request for the\n\ncourt  to  exercise its  equitable powers  to remedy  an existing\n\nviolation  of ERISA and not a request for creating an independent\n\ncause  of  action or  imposing  new  liability.   This  assertion\n\nignores the  allegations made in the complaint  and the essential\n\nnature of the charge against Gorman.  The complaint states:\n\n            Gorman at  all times herein  acted within\n            the scope  of his  employment and  by his\n            actions  participated  in  and  furthered\n            what he knew  or should  have known  were\n            the fiduciary breaches of  [the fiduciary\n            defendants].     Accordingly,  Gorman  is\n            liable under ERISA to  the same extent as\n            the   fiduciaries    for   the   breaches\n            committed after September 13, 1989.\n\n          The Secretary makes no claim that enjoining Gorman from\n\nworking for any ERISA plans in the future is necessary to redress\n\nthe breaches  committed by OMNI's administrators  or is necessary\n\nto  enforce  the  ERISA  provisions  imposing  fiduciary  duties.\n\nInstead, the Secretary is  asking that Gorman be held  liable \"as\n\nthe  fiduciaries,\"  a result  plainly  at odds  with  Russell and\n                                                             \n\nDrinkwater as discussed above.  If the  Secretary really intended\n          \n\nmerely  to remedy  the acts  committed by other  individuals, the\n\ncomplaint would  not have  focussed on Gorman's  alleged misdeeds\n\nbut rather  on  how  Gorman  is  in  a  position  to  remedy  the\n\n                               -20-\n\nfiduciary's  misdeeds.   In  fact, under  the Secretary's  theory\n\nGorman's  misdeeds would  be irrelevant  -- \"innocent\"  and well-\n\nmeaning parties would be reachable  as long as they were in  some\n\nposition to help redress the fiduciaries' breaches.\n\n          Moreover, even  if the  Secretary were to  rephrase the\n\ncomplaint  as   a  request  for  an   injunction  against  Gorman\n\nspecifically for  the purpose of redressing  past, and preventing\n\nfuture,  fiduciary breaches,  the Secretary  would still  fail to\n\nstate a  cause of action.  The  Secretary's claim would still, in\n\nsubstance, constitute  a request for the  imposition of liability\n\nfor an act that is not proscribed by the statute.\n\n          The suit  against Gorman  constitutes an appeal  to the\n\ncourt to impose liability for committing a specific act -- giving\n\nimproper advice to fiduciaries.  It is not an appeal to the court\n\nto remedy  the subsequent  breaches committed by  the fiduciaries\n\nthemselves.   The  appropriate  equitable  relief for  redressing\n\nthose  breaches is not the  action against Gorman  but the remedy\n\nalready requested from the fiduciaries  in Count I, which sought,\n\namong  other things,  the  restoration  of  plan losses  and  the\n\nreversing of prohibited transactions.   We see nothing that makes\n\nGorman  a particularly suitable target for this type of relief as\n\nhe was not party to any prohibited transactions nor the recipient\n\nof  plan  assets.    For  similar  reasons,  the  assertion  that\n\nequitable  relief against  Gorman  is necessary  to prevent  some\n\nhypothetical  fiduciary breaches committed  by those  whom Gorman\n\nmay  advise in  the future  is  unpersuasive.   ERISA extensively\n\n                               -21-\n\nregulates and polices fiduciaries,  see 29 U.S.C    1101  - 1114,\n                                       \n\nand  it  provides  ample  remedies to  prevent  future  fiduciary\n\nbreaches,  see 29  U.S.C.    1132(a)(2),    1109.   Should Gorman\n              \n\nadvise  future  fiduciaries to  break  the law,  we  should think\n\nERISA's  existing  provisions  are  sufficient  to  deter   those\n\nfiduciaries from following his advice.\n\n          It  is in  light  of the  foregoing  that we  can  best\n\nunderstand the apparent  fly in our analytic ointment,  29 U.S.C.\n\n  1132(l).9   The  Secretary argues  that this  civil enforcement\n\n                    \n\n9  29 U.S.C.   1132(l) provides in relevant part:\n\n          (1) In the case of --\n            (A)     any    breach     of    fiduciary\n            responsibility under  (or other violation\n            of) part 4 by a fiduciary, or\n\n            (B)  any knowing participation  in such a\n            breach or violation by any other person, \n\n          the  Secretary shall  assess a  civil penalty\n          against such fiduciary or  other person in an\n          amount  equal to 20 percent of the applicable\n          recovery amount.\n\n          (2)  For purposes of  paragraph (1), the term\n          \"applicable recovery amount\" means any amount\n          which is recovered from a fiduciary or  other\n          person with respect to  a breach or violation\n          described in paragraph (1) --\n\n            (A) pursuant to any  settlement agreement\n            with the Secretary, or\n\n            (B) ordered by a court to be paid by such\n            fiduciary or  other person  to a  plan or\n            its participants and  beneficiaries in  a\n            judicial  proceeding  instituted  by  the\n            Secretary  under   subsection  (a)(2)  or\n            (a)(5) of this section.\n\n   Under paragraph (3) of    1132(l), the Secretary may  waive or\nreduce this penalty if  he believes that \"the fiduciary  or other\n\n                               -22-\n\nprovision, which authorizes civil  penalties for participation in\n\na fiduciary breach by \"other  persons\" based on amounts recovered\n\nby  the Secretary under   1132(a)(2) and   1132 (a)(5), indicates\n\nthat Congress intended for    1132(a)(5) to provide a  remedy for\n\nnonfiduciary violations  of a  fiduciary breach.   Otherwise, the\n\nSecretary  claims,  no civil  penalties  against \"other  persons\"\n\nunder   1132(l)(1)(B) would  be possible and the  provision would\n\nbe rendered meaningless.\n\n          Justice Scalia  rejected this argument in  Mertens, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. at 2070-71, by noting that \n\n            the  \"equitable  relief\" awardable  under\n            [ 1132(a)(5)]  includes  restitution   of\n            ill-gotten   plan   assets  or   profits,\n            providing an \"applicable recovery amount\"\n            to use  to calculate  the penalty, .  . .\n            and even assuming nonfiduciaries  are not\n            liable at all  for knowing  participation\n            in  a fiduciary's  breach  of  duty,  see\n            supra,   at    2067-2068,   cofiduciaries\n                 \n            expressly are, see [29 U.S.C.   1105], so\n            there  are  some  \"other person[s]\"  than\n            fiduciaries-in-breach  liable   under  [ \n            1132(l)(1)(B)].\n\nId. at 2071.\n  \n\n          We find  it significant that the  Secretary invokes the\n\ncivil penalty provision in a case where, because he is seeking an\n\ninjunction,   1132(l)'s civil  penalty based on amounts recovered\n\nunder     1132(a)(5) is  not  applicable.   Cofiduciary  breaches\n\n                    \n\nperson will [otherwise] not be able to restore all losses  to the\nplan  without  severe  financial  hardship.\"  29  U.S.C.     1132\n(l)(3)(B).\n\n                               -23-\n\naside,10  it is  difficult  to  imagine  any case  where  knowing\n\nparticipation  in  a fiduciary  breach  by  a nonfiduciary  would\n\noccasion  the  type of  remedy  (restitution  awards) that  would\n\ntrigger    1132(l)(1)(B) without  the nonfiduciary having engaged\n\nin  a  prohibited  transaction  under   29  U.S.C     110611   or\n\notherwise having obtained some ill-gotten plan assets in a manner\n\nnot covered by the prohibited transaction  section.  We conclude,\n\ntherefore,  that   1132(l)  makes little  sense as  independently\n\nauthorizing equitable relief  against nonfiduciaries like Gorman,\n\nwho allegedly  participated in  a  fiduciary breach  but did  not\n\nengage  in an act prohibited  by the statute  or otherwise obtain\n\nplan assets,  when it can  never be used  for such relief.   If  \n\n1132(l)  fails  to demonstrate  Congressional  intent to  provide\n\nmoney  damages for  nonfiduciary  participation  in  a  fiduciary\n\nbreach, see id. at 2070-71, it is even less likely to demonstrate\n              \n\nCongressional  intent to  provide nonmonetary  equitable remedies\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n10  The Secretary takes issue with Justice Scalia's proposal that\n\"any   other  person\"   in      1132(l)(1)(B)   could  refer   to\ncofiduciaries.      According  to   the   Secretary,  cofiduciary\nliability,  established under  29  U.S.C.    1105, clearly  falls\nunder     1132(l)(1)(A) and  not    1132(l)(1)(B).   We  need not\nresolve this dispute and therefore do not.\n\n11  We recognize that prohibited transactions are also covered by\na separate civil penalty provision, 29 U.S.C.   1132(i), but that\ndoes  not   necessarily  mean  civil   penalties  for  prohibited\ntransactions cannot be  obtained under    1132(l) as  well.   The\npenalty under   1132(i)  is completely discretionary and adjusted\naccording to whether the  prohibited transaction was corrected or\nnot.   The  penalty under    1132(l),  however, is  mandatory and\ncontains  special procedures for a general waiver.  Thus, the two\nprovisions appear to serve distinct and coextensive purposes: one\nis tailored specifically to redress individual transactions while\nthe other is designed to penalize conduct more generally.\n\n                               -24-\n\nfor nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach.\n\n                         III.  CONCLUSION\n\n          The  Secretary's  interpretation  of     1132(a)(5)  as\n\nauthorizing  an actionable claim in  any situation where an ERISA\n\nviolation  has  occurred  and  the  Secretary  thinks  relief  is\n\n\"appropriate,\"  regardless  of  whether  or not  that  relief  is\n\ndirected  at  an act  or  practice addressed  by  the substantive\n\nprovisions  of the statute, stretches the language of   502(a)(5)\n\npast its breaking point.  For this reason and because  we decline\n\nto  exercise  our  common  lawmaking authority  or  our  inherent\n\nequitable  powers  in  situations  where  a professional  service\n\nprovider assists in a fiduciary breach but receives no ill-gotten\n\nplan assets, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                           \n\n                               -25-\n",

In the complaint, the Secretary alleged a number of ERISA violations in relation to OMNI's failure to pay approximately two to three million dollars in medical benefits to eligible employees of companies participating in the OMNI health plan.  The Secretary also contended that appellee, H. James Gorman, Jr.  (\"Gorman\"), a financial consultant who provided professional services to OMNI, knowingly participated in the fiduciary breaches of several of OMNI's administrators. The district court dismissed the action against Gorman for failure to state a claim under ERISA and the Secretary brought this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept all the factual allegations in the Secretary's complaint as true in order to review the district court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

Ponce Federal Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1986 and 1990, OMNI provided group medical, dental, and life insurance and other benefits to a number of small, unrelated business employers in Massachusetts.  The employers participating in OMNI established employee welfare benefit plans (the \"welfare plans\") within the meaning of ERISA Sec. 3(1), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1).  By collecting premiums from the participating employers, OMNI held and controlled the assets of the welfare plans and was responsible for paying benefits to the employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary claimed that OMNI falsely represented itself to be a \"tax-exempt ERISA covered benefit plan\" under ERISA Sec. 3(1), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1), in order to avoid governmental regulation and oversight.  According to the Secretary, OMNI was a multiple employer welfare arrangement (\"MEWA\") within the meaning of ERISA Sec. 3(40)(A), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(40)(A), but not an ERISA plan exempt from state insurance regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the complaint alleged that Harbor Medical Administrators, Inc.  (\"HMA\"), the administrator of OMNI, and HMA's President (Mr. Richard Rowe), Executive Vice-President (Mr. Phillip Carpenter) and Vice President (Ms. Ann Dunlop) acted as fiduciaries with respect to the employers' welfare plans.  The Secretary asserted that these four defendants breached their fiduciary obligations under ERISA by engaging in a variety of imprudent and self-serving activities.  The activities included engaging in prohibited transactions, mismanaging and misusing assets of the welfare plans, falsely representing the status of OMNI to employers and state regulators, and operating an illegal insurance company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II of the complaint alleged that Gorman, who was Director of Group Insurance and Welfare Plan Consulting Services, Actuarial, Benefits and Compensation Consulting, at the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, provided \"professional services\" to OMNI from May through October of 1989.  In particular, he provided advice to HMA regarding the legal status of OMNI under ERISA.  On several occasions, Gorman informed Dunlop, Rowe and others at HMA that they were operating an illegal insurance company under Massachusetts law and that OMNI did not enjoy the protection of the ERISA provision exempting ERISA plans from state regulation.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144.  Despite his own warnings, Gorman advised Dunlop, in response to a letter from the New Hampshire Insurance Department inquiring as to the legal status of OMNI, that she had the option to \"try the 'red herring' across the trail of the Insurance Department just to keep them off balance\" by telling them OMNI was an ERISA covered plan.  The gist of this advice was that OMNI could avoid state regulation by obfuscating its true legal status.  Gorman provided Dunlop with a draft letter to send to the New Hampshire Insurance Department falsely stating that OMNI was covered by ERISA.  Gorman further advised that there was little risk of investigation by the state once it was informed of a plan's ERISA status.  Subsequently, Rowe adopted Gorman's draft letter and sent it to New Hampshire's Insurance Department on October 17, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint stated that Gorman acted at all times \"within the scope of his employment\" and by his actions participated in the fiduciary breaches of the defendants named in Count I.  The Secretary did not allege that Gorman himself was a fiduciary.  The Secretary concluded, however, that \"Gorman is liable under ERISA to the same extent as the fiduciaries for the breaches committed.\"   Gorman's employer, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, was also named as a defendant based on the theory that it was liable for the actions of its agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To remedy the alleged violations, the Secretary sought the recovery of plan losses, the undoing of prohibited transactions and a permanent injunction against all defendants, including Gorman, from serving as ERISA fiduciaries or service providers to any ERISA plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 1, 1992, the district court granted motions to dismiss filed by Gorman and Coopers &amp; Lybrand based on the failure of Count II to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The district court held that neither of the two ERISA enforcement provisions under which the Secretary could proceed, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(2) and Sec. 1132(a)(5), authorized a claim against nonfiduciaries like Gorman or Coopers &amp; Lybrand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court found that the Secretary could not obtain relief under Sec. 1132(a)(5) because that section applies only to nonfiduciary defendants who are \"parties in interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court also found that no cause of action existed under Sec. 1132(a)(2), which authorizes the Secretary to seek appropriate relief under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> because only fiduciaries could be sued under Sec. 1109 and neither Gorman nor Coopers &amp; Lybrand were fiduciaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, the Supreme Court held in a five to four decision that ERISA does not permit a civil suit for money damages against nonfiduciaries who knowingly participate in a fiduciary breach.  Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2072.   The Court in Mertens found that \"appropriate equitable relief,\" as authorized under Sec. 1132(a)(3),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> includes only those types of relief typically available in equity, such as injunctions or restitution.  Such relief would not include a classic form of legal relief like compensatory damages.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2068.   The Court discussed, but expressly refrained from deciding, whether ERISA provides any remedy at all for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach.  Id. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067-68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Mertens decision, the Secretary withdrew the appeal of his claim against Coopers &amp; Lybrand because that claim only sought monetary damages.  The Secretary pursued the appeal of Gorman's dismissal to the extent the Secretary was seeking only equitable relief.  The four fiduciary defendants in this case defaulted leaving Gorman as the only defendant who is party to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the center of this case is the language of Sec. 502(a)(5) of ERISA which states that the Secretary may bring a civil action</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violation or (ii) to enforce any provision of this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that its action against Gorman for alleged participation in the fiduciary breaches of OMNI's administrators constitutes a claim for \"appropriate equitable relief to redress\" violations of ERISA or \"to enforce\" provisions of ERISA under Sec. 1132(a)(5)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  According to the Secretary, the language of the provision does not explicitly require that the ERISA violation must be one committed by the person against whom the relief is sought, so long as the relief is \"appropriate\" for purposes of \"redressing\" a violation.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- n. 1, 113 S.Ct. at 2073 n. 1 (White, J., dissenting).  Likewise, one could arguably bring an action against a nonfiduciary for the purposes of \"enforcing\" a provision of ERISA which imposes no obligation on that nonfiduciary but nevertheless requires some judicial relief against the nonfiduciary in order to remain effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Secretary argues that enjoining Gorman from providing any services to an ERISA plan would be an appropriate way of redressing the breaches committed by OMNI's administrators and of preventing subsequent breaches by some hypothetical group of fiduciaries who might take Gorman's advice in the future.  While plausible, we find that such a broad reading of this enforcement provision is contrary to a common sense construction of the ERISA statute and to the established restriction on our ability to create new causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret Sec. 1132(a)(5) to authorize actions only against those who commit violations of ERISA or who are engaged in an \"act or practice\" proscribed by the statute.  Section 1132(a)(5)(A) authorizes injunctions against any \"act or practice\" which violates ERISA, while Sec. 1132(a)(5)(B) authorizes other equitable remedies for such acts or practices.  Section 1132(a)(5)(B) simply adds remedies to the injunction authorized under Sec. 1132(a)(5)(A);  it does not expand the substantive reach of ERISA to encompass new parties and transactions not otherwise covered by its substantive provisions.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (noting in dicta that identical language in Sec. 1132(a)(3) \"does not, after all, authorize 'appropriate equitable relief' at large, but only 'appropriate equitable relief' for the purpose of 'redress[ing any] violations or ... enforc[ing] any provisions' of ERISA\");  Call v. Sumitomo Bank of California, 881 F.2d 626, 635 (9th Cir.1989);  Nieto v. Ecker, 845 F.2d 868, 873-74 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.1988);  see also Kyle Rys., Inc. v. Pacific Admin. Servs., Inc., 990 F.2d 513, 516-17 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that relief for nonfiduciary liability is only available when nonfiduciary is engaged in a prohibited transaction under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1106(a)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gorman's alleged participation in HMA's fiduciary breach is not an \"act or practice\" which violates ERISA.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067;  Call, 881 F.2d at 635.   Moreover, the Secretary does not point to any substantive provision of ERISA that imposes a duty on nonfiduciaries to refrain from participating in a fiduciary breach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Consequently, Sec. 1132(a)(5) does not authorize the Secretary's action against Gorman in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary nevertheless asserts that we should apply the court's broad equitable powers and the court's federal common law-making authority under ERISA to read Sec. 1132(a)(5) expansively to authorize equitable relief for Gorman's alleged conduct.  He invokes the established rule that the courts have power under ERISA to fashion common law based on the law of trusts to construe ambiguous statutory language and fill gaps in the statute.  See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 110-15, 109 S.Ct. 948, 954-57, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989);  Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 56, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1557, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987);  Kwatcher v. Massachusetts Service Employees Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 966 (1st Cir.1989).  In several pre-Mertens cases, the courts have exercised this power to afford a remedy against nonfiduciaries who participate in a fiduciary breach.  See, e.g., Diduck v. Kaszycki &amp; Sons Contractors, Inc., 974 F.2d 270, 279-81 (2d Cir.1992);  Whitfield v. Lindemann, 853 F.2d 1298, 1303 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1089, 109 S.Ct. 2428, 104 L.Ed.2d 986 (1989);  Brock v. Hendershott, 840 F.2d 339, 342 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refuse to adopt a common law remedy in this case because the Secretary's expansive application of Sec. 1132(a)(5) creates a new cause of action and a new source of liability where neither currently exists in the statute.  As Justice Scalia explained in Mertens,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>no provision explicitly requires [nonfiduciaries] to avoid participation (knowing or unknowing) in a fiduciary's breach of fiduciary duty.  It is unlikely, moreover, that this was an oversight, since ERISA does explicitly impose \"knowing participation\" liability on cofiduciaries.  See Sec. 405(a), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1105(a).  That limitation appears all the more deliberate in light of the fact that \"knowing participation\" liability on the part of both cotrustees and third persons was well established under the common law of trusts....  In Russell we emphasized our unwillingness to infer causes of action in the ERISA context, since that statute's carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme provides \"strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (quoting Massachusetts Mut.

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 846 F.2d 821 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909, 109 S.Ct. 261, 102 L.Ed.2d 249 (1988).  In Drinkwater, we applied Russell to hold that extra-contractual damages are not a form of \"other appropriate relief\" under Sec. 1132(a)(5) because such relief was not expressly granted and we could not conclude \"Congress intended to authorize any form of relief other than what was expressly granted.\"  Id. at 824;  see also Russell 473 U.S. at 145-48, 105 S.Ct. at 3092-93 (refusing to imply a private cause of action for individual beneficiaries to obtain damages caused by a fiduciary breach because Congress had created such liability only in favor of the ERISA plans themselves).  In this case, Congress did not expressly provide for a remedy against nonfiduciaries who participate in a fiduciary breach.  Therefore, and in light of the potentially broad area of liability such a remedy would create, we conclude that Congress did not intend for its grant of equitable relief in Sec. 1132(a)(5) to authorize the present action against Gorman.  See Framingham Union Hosp., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 744 F.Supp. 29, 33 (D.Mass.1990) (finding that under ERISA, \"the courts' authority to adopt trust-law principles is limited to fashioning 'appropriate relief' under specified causes of action, among specified parties\") (citing Nieto, 845 F.2d at 872).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary claims that the Russell and Drinkwater decisions do not apply to this case because they involved situations where the statutory language clearly excluded the requested remedy.  See Russell, 473 U.S. at 141-43, 105 S.Ct. at 3090-91 (language granting damage remedies \"to the plan\" excluded damages to other parties like beneficiaries);  Drinkwater, 846 F.2d at 824-25 (finding express grant of \"equitable relief\" excluded other types of relief such as compensatory and punitive damages).  The court's common lawmaking authority was not exercised in those cases because that authority does not include the power \"to revise the text of the statute.\"  Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that in this case, however, where the statute is silent or ambiguous, courts should look to ERISA's broader purposes of protecting the interests of participants and beneficiaries, see Firestone, 489 U.S. at 113, 109 S.Ct. at 955, and provide a remedy where necessary to further those purposes;  the court should not just assume that the absence of express authority is a deliberate omission and thus a bar to remedial measures.  According to the Secretary, our decisions in Kwatcher v. Massachusetts Serv.  Emp. Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 965-66 (1st Cir.1989), and Malden Mills Indus., Inc. v. Alman, 971 F.2d 768, 774-75 (1st Cir.1992), are examples of this principle because in those cases we applied common law remedies to situations in which the ERISA statute did not specify a cause of action.  Kwatcher, 879 F.2d at 965-66 (applying federal common law to allow restitution action for recovery of overpayments to an ERISA pension fund);  Malden Mills, 971 F.2d at 774-75 (recognizing a common law right to \"restitution for overpayment of contributions by an employer to a Fund\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All things considered, judicial remedies for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach fall within the line of cases where Congress deliberately omitted a potential cause of action rather than the cases where Congress has invited the courts to engage in interstitial lawmaking.  To begin with, Congress proscribed several \"acts or practices\" in ERISA's substantive provisions that involve nonfiduciaries but did not include among them a nonfiduciary's knowing participation in a fiduciary breach.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- &amp; n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 &amp; n. 4.   For example, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1106(a)(1) prohibits certain transactions between \"parties in interest,\" see supra, note 2, and ERISA plans,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1023(d)(8) prohibits actuaries from breaching their duty to certify that their actuarial statements are \"complete and accurate.\"   In addition, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1105 imposes liability on cofiduciaries for knowingly participating in a fiduciary breach.  It is such \"acts or practices\" as these for which Sec. 1132(a)(5) provides a remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Congress desired to augment the existing remedies against fiduciary breaches, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), by providing for an action against nonfiduciaries for assisting those breaches, it could have done so with provisions similar to those concerning cofiduciaries and prohibited transactions.  See Russell, 473 U.S. at 147, 105 S.Ct. at 3093 (\" 'The presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.' \")  (quoting Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77, 97, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 1583-84, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981));  see also Useden v. Acker, 947 F.2d 1563, 1581 (11th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2927, 124 L.Ed.2d 678 (1993) (\"[A] court should only incorporate a given trust law principle if the statute's text negates an inference that the principle was omitted deliberately from the statute.\").  In contrast, the Kwatcher and Malden Mills cases presented a situation not of deliberate omission, but one where the remedy was \"fully consonant with ERISA's underlying policies as expressed in 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1103(c)(2)(A).\"  Kwatcher, 879 F.2d at 967 (finding common law restitution action consistent with statutory provision allowing for the return of mistaken contributions);  see also Malden Mills, 971 F.2d at 775 (noting that the same statutory provision supports a right of restitution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, we do not find it appropriate to authorize a common law cause of action in this case because nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach is most likely to involve, as it does here, service providers and other nonfiduciary professionals who provide advice or expertise to ERISA fiduciaries.  The advice and expertise provided by these individuals--whether actuaries, lawyers, accountants, or consultants--is vital for the successful operation of ERISA plans which must function in a highly complex and regulated environment.  At the same time, such advice is particularly vulnerable to remedies that impose liability like the one requested by the Secretary.  We do not mean to countenance the action of someone who advises a fiduciary to break the law, but we are concerned that extending the threat of liability over the heads of those who only lend professional services to a plan without exercising any control over, or transacting with, plan assets will deter such individuals from helping fiduciaries navigate the intricate financial and legal thicket of ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress recognized this danger and was purposefully circumspect about limiting the liability of those providing professional services to ERISA plans.  See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1108(b)(2) (exempting from the list of transactions prohibited under ERISA, contracts or arrangements with a party in interest for \"legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan\").

Waller, 906 F.2d 985, 992-94 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 982, 111 S.Ct. 512, 112 L.Ed.2d 524 (1990);  Luby v. Teamsters Health, Welfare, &amp; Pension Trust Funds, 944 F.2d 1176, 1185-87 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, no restitution remedy exists.  The Secretary never alleged that Gorman received or controlled ERISA plan assets, and we would not consider the salary Gorman presumably earned<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> as ill-gotten profits.  Instead, we would consider Gorman's salary as a part of the ERISA plan's cost of operations.  Furthermore, the facts of this case do not present a situation where the court must use its equitable powers, as the Secretary warns, \"to stop an ongoing bribery or kickback scheme, or [provide] restitution and a constructive trust to recover funds transferred from a plan to a nonfiduciary.\"   In those situations, unlike the present case, the act or practice being remedied is either expressly proscribed by the statute (by Sec. 1106, for example, which prohibits certain transactions between the plan and a \"party in interest\"), and thus explicitly covered under Sec. 1132(a)(5), or else within our recognized powers of granting restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a somewhat different tack, the Secretary attempts to characterize the suit against Gorman as merely a request for the court to exercise its equitable powers to remedy an existing violation of ERISA and not a request for creating an independent cause of action or imposing new liability.  This assertion ignores the allegations made in the complaint and the essential nature of the charge against Gorman.  The complaint states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Gorman at all times herein acted within the scope of his employment and by his actions participated in and furthered what he knew or should have known were the fiduciary breaches of [the fiduciary defendants].  Accordingly, Gorman is liable under ERISA to the same extent as the fiduciaries for the breaches committed after September 13, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary makes no claim that enjoining Gorman from working for any ERISA plans in the future is necessary to redress the breaches committed by OMNI's administrators or is necessary to enforce the ERISA provisions imposing fiduciary duties.  Instead, the Secretary is asking that Gorman be held liable \"as the fiduciaries,\" a result plainly at odds with Russell and Drinkwater as discussed above.  If the Secretary really intended merely to remedy the acts committed by other individuals, the complaint would not have focussed on Gorman's alleged misdeeds but rather on how Gorman is in a position to remedy the fiduciary's misdeeds.  In fact, under the Secretary's theory Gorman's misdeeds would be irrelevant--\"innocent\" and well-meaning parties would be reachable as long as they were in some position to help redress the fiduciaries' breaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the Secretary were to rephrase the complaint as a request for an injunction against Gorman specifically for the purpose of redressing past, and preventing future, fiduciary breaches, the Secretary would still fail to state a cause of action.  The Secretary's claim would still, in substance, constitute a request for the imposition of liability for an act that is not proscribed by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit against Gorman constitutes an appeal to the court to impose liability for committing a specific act--giving improper advice to fiduciaries.  It is not an appeal to the court to remedy the subsequent breaches committed by the fiduciaries themselves.  The appropriate equitable relief for redressing those breaches is not the action against Gorman but the remedy already requested from the fiduciaries in Count I, which sought, among other things, the restoration of plan losses and the reversing of prohibited transactions.  We see nothing that makes Gorman a particularly suitable target for this type of relief as he was not party to any prohibited transactions nor the recipient of plan assets.  For similar reasons, the assertion that equitable relief against Gorman is necessary to prevent some hypothetical fiduciary breaches committed by those whom Gorman may advise in the future is unpersuasive.  ERISA extensively regulates and polices fiduciaries, see 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1101-1114, and it provides ample remedies to prevent future fiduciary breaches, see 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(2), Sec. 1109.  Should Gorman advise future fiduciaries to break the law, we should think ERISA's existing provisions are sufficient to deter those fiduciaries from following his advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is in light of the foregoing that we can best understand the apparent fly in our analytic ointment, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(l ).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Secretary argues that this civil enforcement provision, which authorizes civil penalties for participation in a fiduciary breach by \"other persons\" based on amounts recovered by the Secretary under Sec. 1132(a)(2) and Sec. 1132(a)(5), indicates that Congress intended for Sec. 1132(a)(5) to provide a remedy for nonfiduciary violations of a fiduciary breach.  Otherwise, the Secretary claims, no civil penalties against \"other persons\" under Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) would be possible and the provision would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Scalia rejected this argument in Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070-71, by noting that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>the \"equitable relief\" awardable under [Sec. 1132(a)(5) ] includes restitution of ill-gotten plan assets or profits, providing an \"applicable recovery amount\" to use to calculate the penalty, ... and even assuming nonfiduciaries are not liable at all for knowing participation in a fiduciary's breach of duty, see  supra, at 2067-2068, cofiduciaries expressly are, see [29 U.S.C. Sec. 1105], so there are some \"other person[s]\" than fiduciaries-in-breach liable under [Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2071.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it significant that the Secretary invokes the civil penalty provision in a case where, because he is seeking an injunction, Sec. 1132(l )'s civil penalty based on amounts recovered under Sec. 1132(a)(5) is not applicable.  Cofiduciary breaches aside,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> it is difficult to imagine any case where knowing participation in a fiduciary breach by a nonfiduciary would occasion the type of remedy (restitution awards) that would trigger Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) without the nonfiduciary having engaged in a prohibited transaction under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1106<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> or otherwise having obtained some ill-gotten plan assets in a manner not covered by the prohibited transaction section.  We conclude, therefore, that Sec. 1132(l ) makes little sense as independently authorizing equitable relief against nonfiduciaries like Gorman, who allegedly participated in a fiduciary breach but did not engage in an act prohibited by the statute or otherwise obtain plan assets, when it can never be used for such relief.  If Sec. 1132(l ) fails to demonstrate Congressional intent to provide money damages for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach, see id. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070-71, it is even less likely to demonstrate Congressional intent to provide nonmonetary equitable remedies for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's interpretation of Sec. 1132(a)(5) as authorizing an actionable claim in any situation where an ERISA violation has occurred and the Secretary thinks relief is \"appropriate,\" regardless of whether or not that relief is directed at an act or practice addressed by the substantive provisions of the statute, stretches the language of Sec. 502(a)(5) past its breaking point.  For this reason and because we decline to exercise our common lawmaking authority or our inherent equitable powers in situations where a professional service provider assists in a fiduciary breach but receives no ill-gotten plan assets, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 29 U.S.C.

Section 1132(l ) was added to ERISA in 1989, see Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-239, Sec. 2101, 103 Stat. 2123.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of this appeal was a lawsuit brought by the United States Secretary of Labor (the \"Secretary\") on March 11, 1991, against several corporate and individual defendants involved in the failed OMNI Medical Health and Welfare Trust (\"OMNI\").  In the complaint, the Secretary alleged a number of ERISA violations in relation to OMNI's failure to pay approximately two to three million dollars in medical benefits to eligible employees of companies participating in the OMNI health plan.  The Secretary also contended that appellee, H. James Gorman, Jr.  (\"Gorman\"), a financial consultant who provided professional services to OMNI, knowingly participated in the fiduciary breaches of several of OMNI's administrators. The district court dismissed the action against Gorman for failure to state a claim under ERISA and the Secretary brought this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept all the factual allegations in the Secretary's complaint as true in order to review the district court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Federal Bank, F.S.B., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1986 and 1990, OMNI provided group medical, dental, and life insurance and other benefits to a number of small, unrelated business employers in Massachusetts.  The employers participating in OMNI established employee welfare benefit plans (the \"welfare plans\") within the meaning of ERISA Sec. 3(1), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1).  By collecting premiums from the participating employers, OMNI held and controlled the assets of the welfare plans and was responsible for paying benefits to the employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary claimed that OMNI falsely represented itself to be a \"tax-exempt ERISA covered benefit plan\" under ERISA Sec. 3(1), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(1), in order to avoid governmental regulation and oversight.  According to the Secretary, OMNI was a multiple employer welfare arrangement (\"MEWA\") within the meaning of ERISA Sec. 3(40)(A), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(40)(A), but not an ERISA plan exempt from state insurance regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the complaint alleged that Harbor Medical Administrators, Inc.  (\"HMA\"), the administrator of OMNI, and HMA's President (Mr. Richard Rowe), Executive Vice-President (Mr. Phillip Carpenter) and Vice President (Ms. Ann Dunlop) acted as fiduciaries with respect to the employers' welfare plans.  The Secretary asserted that these four defendants breached their fiduciary obligations under ERISA by engaging in a variety of imprudent and self-serving activities.  The activities included engaging in prohibited transactions, mismanaging and misusing assets of the welfare plans, falsely representing the status of OMNI to employers and state regulators, and operating an illegal insurance company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II of the complaint alleged that Gorman, who was Director of Group Insurance and Welfare Plan Consulting Services, Actuarial, Benefits and Compensation Consulting, at the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, provided \"professional services\" to OMNI from May through October of 1989.  In particular, he provided advice to HMA regarding the legal status of OMNI under ERISA.  On several occasions, Gorman informed Dunlop, Rowe and others at HMA that they were operating an illegal insurance company under Massachusetts law and that OMNI did not enjoy the protection of the ERISA provision exempting ERISA plans from state regulation.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144.  Despite his own warnings, Gorman advised Dunlop, in response to a letter from the New Hampshire Insurance Department inquiring as to the legal status of OMNI, that she had the option to \"try the 'red herring' across the trail of the Insurance Department just to keep them off balance\" by telling them OMNI was an ERISA covered plan.  The gist of this advice was that OMNI could avoid state regulation by obfuscating its true legal status.  Gorman provided Dunlop with a draft letter to send to the New Hampshire Insurance Department falsely stating that OMNI was covered by ERISA.  Gorman further advised that there was little risk of investigation by the state once it was informed of a plan's ERISA status.

The Secretary did not allege that Gorman himself was a fiduciary.  The Secretary concluded, however, that \"Gorman is liable under ERISA to the same extent as the fiduciaries for the breaches committed.\"   Gorman's employer, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, was also named as a defendant based on the theory that it was liable for the actions of its agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To remedy the alleged violations, the Secretary sought the recovery of plan losses, the undoing of prohibited transactions and a permanent injunction against all defendants, including Gorman, from serving as ERISA fiduciaries or service providers to any ERISA plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 1, 1992, the district court granted motions to dismiss filed by Gorman and Coopers &amp; Lybrand based on the failure of Count II to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The district court held that neither of the two ERISA enforcement provisions under which the Secretary could proceed, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(2) and Sec. 1132(a)(5), authorized a claim against nonfiduciaries like Gorman or Coopers &amp; Lybrand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court found that the Secretary could not obtain relief under Sec. 1132(a)(5) because that section applies only to nonfiduciary defendants who are \"parties in interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court also found that no cause of action existed under Sec. 1132(a)(2), which authorizes the Secretary to seek appropriate relief under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> because only fiduciaries could be sued under Sec. 1109 and neither Gorman nor Coopers &amp; Lybrand were fiduciaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, the Supreme Court held in a five to four decision that ERISA does not permit a civil suit for money damages against nonfiduciaries who knowingly participate in a fiduciary breach.  Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2072.   The Court in Mertens found that \"appropriate equitable relief,\" as authorized under Sec. 1132(a)(3),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> includes only those types of relief typically available in equity, such as injunctions or restitution.  Such relief would not include a classic form of legal relief like compensatory damages.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2068.   The Court discussed, but expressly refrained from deciding, whether ERISA provides any remedy at all for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach.

The Secretary pursued the appeal of Gorman's dismissal to the extent the Secretary was seeking only equitable relief.  The four fiduciary defendants in this case defaulted leaving Gorman as the only defendant who is party to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the center of this case is the language of Sec. 502(a)(5) of ERISA which states that the Secretary may bring a civil action</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violation or (ii) to enforce any provision of this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that its action against Gorman for alleged participation in the fiduciary breaches of OMNI's administrators constitutes a claim for \"appropriate equitable relief to redress\" violations of ERISA or \"to enforce\" provisions of ERISA under Sec. 1132(a)(5)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  According to the Secretary, the language of the provision does not explicitly require that the ERISA violation must be one committed by the person against whom the relief is sought, so long as the relief is \"appropriate\" for purposes of \"redressing\" a violation.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- n. 1, 113 S.Ct. at 2073 n. 1 (White, J., dissenting).  Likewise, one could arguably bring an action against a nonfiduciary for the purposes of \"enforcing\" a provision of ERISA which imposes no obligation on that nonfiduciary but nevertheless requires some judicial relief against the nonfiduciary in order to remain effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Secretary argues that enjoining Gorman from providing any services to an ERISA plan would be an appropriate way of redressing the breaches committed by OMNI's administrators and of preventing subsequent breaches by some hypothetical group of fiduciaries who might take Gorman's advice in the future.  While plausible, we find that such a broad reading of this enforcement provision is contrary to a common sense construction of the ERISA statute and to the established restriction on our ability to create new causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret Sec. 1132(a)(5) to authorize actions only against those who commit violations of ERISA or who are engaged in an \"act or practice\" proscribed by the statute.  Section 1132(a)(5)(A) authorizes injunctions against any \"act or practice\" which violates ERISA, while Sec. 1132(a)(5)(B) authorizes other equitable remedies for such acts or practices.  Section 1132(a)(5)(B) simply adds remedies to the injunction authorized under Sec. 1132(a)(5)(A);  it does not expand the substantive reach of ERISA to encompass new parties and transactions not otherwise covered by its substantive provisions.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (noting in dicta that identical language in Sec. 1132(a)(3) \"does not, after all, authorize 'appropriate equitable relief' at large, but only 'appropriate equitable relief' for the purpose of 'redress[ing any] violations or ... enforc[ing] any provisions' of ERISA\");  Call v.

That limitation appears all the more deliberate in light of the fact that \"knowing participation\" liability on the part of both cotrustees and third persons was well established under the common law of trusts....  In Russell we emphasized our unwillingness to infer causes of action in the ERISA context, since that statute's carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme provides \"strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 (quoting Massachusetts Mut.

In this case, Congress did not expressly provide for a remedy against nonfiduciaries who participate in a fiduciary breach.  Therefore, and in light of the potentially broad area of liability such a remedy would create, we conclude that Congress did not intend for its grant of equitable relief in Sec. 1132(a)(5) to authorize the present action against Gorman.

The court's common lawmaking authority was not exercised in those cases because that authority does not include the power \"to revise the text of the statute.\"  Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that in this case, however, where the statute is silent or ambiguous, courts should look to ERISA's broader purposes of protecting the interests of participants and beneficiaries, see Firestone, 489 U.S. at 113, 109 S.Ct. at 955, and provide a remedy where necessary to further those purposes;  the court should not just assume that the absence of express authority is a deliberate omission and thus a bar to remedial measures.

To begin with, Congress proscribed several \"acts or practices\" in ERISA's substantive provisions that involve nonfiduciaries but did not include among them a nonfiduciary's knowing participation in a fiduciary breach.  See Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- &amp; n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2067 &amp; n. 4.   For example, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1106(a)(1) prohibits certain transactions between \"parties in interest,\" see supra, note 2, and ERISA plans,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1023(d)(8) prohibits actuaries from breaching their duty to certify that their actuarial statements are \"complete and accurate.\"   In addition, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1105 imposes liability on cofiduciaries for knowingly participating in a fiduciary breach.  It is such \"acts or practices\" as these for which Sec. 1132(a)(5) provides a remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Congress desired to augment the existing remedies against fiduciary breaches, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), by providing for an action against nonfiduciaries for assisting those breaches, it could have done so with provisions similar to those concerning cofiduciaries and prohibited transactions.  See Russell, 473 U.S. at 147, 105 S.Ct. at 3093 (\" 'The presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.' \")  (quoting Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.

In contrast, the Kwatcher and Malden Mills cases presented a situation not of deliberate omission, but one where the remedy was \"fully consonant with ERISA's underlying policies as expressed in 29 U.S.C.

The advice and expertise provided by these individuals--whether actuaries, lawyers, accountants, or consultants--is vital for the successful operation of ERISA plans which must function in a highly complex and regulated environment.  At the same time, such advice is particularly vulnerable to remedies that impose liability like the one requested by the Secretary.  We do not mean to countenance the action of someone who advises a fiduciary to break the law, but we are concerned that extending the threat of liability over the heads of those who only lend professional services to a plan without exercising any control over, or transacting with, plan assets will deter such individuals from helping fiduciaries navigate the intricate financial and legal thicket of ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress recognized this danger and was purposefully circumspect about limiting the liability of those providing professional services to ERISA plans.

Congress decided that the best approach was to limit liability for nonfiduciaries, especially service providers, while at the same time increasing the number of fiduciary parties and the scope of fiduciary responsibility. See Mertens, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2071.   We decline to upset this decision by invoking our common law authority in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are more willing to create common law remedies that are directed toward undoing specific transactions or recovering assets of an ERISA plan.  In those situations, the parties are more likely to be in control of plan assets and thus functionally more like fiduciaries.  As we demonstrated in Kwatcher and Malden Mills, the provision of restitution remedies to seek the return of plan assets can be a proper exercise of our common lawmaking authority.

The Secretary never alleged that Gorman received or controlled ERISA plan assets, and we would not consider the salary Gorman presumably earned<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> as ill-gotten profits.  Instead, we would consider Gorman's salary as a part of the ERISA plan's cost of operations.  Furthermore, the facts of this case do not present a situation where the court must use its equitable powers, as the Secretary warns, \"to stop an ongoing bribery or kickback scheme, or [provide] restitution and a constructive trust to recover funds transferred from a plan to a nonfiduciary.\"   In those situations, unlike the present case, the act or practice being remedied is either expressly proscribed by the statute (by Sec. 1106, for example, which prohibits certain transactions between the plan and a \"party in interest\"), and thus explicitly covered under Sec. 1132(a)(5), or else within our recognized powers of granting restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a somewhat different tack, the Secretary attempts to characterize the suit against Gorman as merely a request for the court to exercise its equitable powers to remedy an existing violation of ERISA and not a request for creating an independent cause of action or imposing new liability.  This assertion ignores the allegations made in the complaint and the essential nature of the charge against Gorman.  The complaint states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Gorman at all times herein acted within the scope of his employment and by his actions participated in and furthered what he knew or should have known were the fiduciary breaches of [the fiduciary defendants].  Accordingly, Gorman is liable under ERISA to the same extent as the fiduciaries for the breaches committed after September 13, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary makes no claim that enjoining Gorman from working for any ERISA plans in the future is necessary to redress the breaches committed by OMNI's administrators or is necessary to enforce the ERISA provisions imposing fiduciary duties.  Instead, the Secretary is asking that Gorman be held liable \"as the fiduciaries,\" a result plainly at odds with Russell and Drinkwater as discussed above.  If the Secretary really intended merely to remedy the acts committed by other individuals, the complaint would not have focussed on Gorman's alleged misdeeds but rather on how Gorman is in a position to remedy the fiduciary's misdeeds.  In fact, under the Secretary's theory Gorman's misdeeds would be irrelevant--\"innocent\" and well-meaning parties would be reachable as long as they were in some position to help redress the fiduciaries' breaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the Secretary were to rephrase the complaint as a request for an injunction against Gorman specifically for the purpose of redressing past, and preventing future, fiduciary breaches, the Secretary would still fail to state a cause of action.  The Secretary's claim would still, in substance, constitute a request for the imposition of liability for an act that is not proscribed by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit against Gorman constitutes an appeal to the court to impose liability for committing a specific act--giving improper advice to fiduciaries.  It is not an appeal to the court to remedy the subsequent breaches committed by the fiduciaries themselves.  The appropriate equitable relief for redressing those breaches is not the action against Gorman but the remedy already requested from the fiduciaries in Count I, which sought, among other things, the restoration of plan losses and the reversing of prohibited transactions.  We see nothing that makes Gorman a particularly suitable target for this type of relief as he was not party to any prohibited transactions nor the recipient of plan assets.  For similar reasons, the assertion that equitable relief against Gorman is necessary to prevent some hypothetical fiduciary breaches committed by those whom Gorman may advise in the future is unpersuasive.  ERISA extensively regulates and polices fiduciaries, see 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1101-1114, and it provides ample remedies to prevent future fiduciary breaches, see 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(2), Sec. 1109.  Should Gorman advise future fiduciaries to break the law, we should think ERISA's existing provisions are sufficient to deter those fiduciaries from following his advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is in light of the foregoing that we can best understand the apparent fly in our analytic ointment, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(l ).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Secretary argues that this civil enforcement provision, which authorizes civil penalties for participation in a fiduciary breach by \"other persons\" based on amounts recovered by the Secretary under Sec. 1132(a)(2) and Sec. 1132(a)(5), indicates that Congress intended for Sec. 1132(a)(5) to provide a remedy for nonfiduciary violations of a fiduciary breach.  Otherwise, the Secretary claims, no civil penalties against \"other persons\" under Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) would be possible and the provision would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Scalia rejected this argument in Mertens, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070-71, by noting that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>the \"equitable relief\" awardable under [Sec. 1132(a)(5) ] includes restitution of ill-gotten plan assets or profits, providing an \"applicable recovery amount\" to use to calculate the penalty, ... and even assuming nonfiduciaries are not liable at all for knowing participation in a fiduciary's breach of duty, see  supra, at 2067-2068, cofiduciaries expressly are, see [29 U.S.C. Sec. 1105], so there are some \"other person[s]\" than fiduciaries-in-breach liable under [Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2071.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it significant that the Secretary invokes the civil penalty provision in a case where, because he is seeking an injunction, Sec. 1132(l )'s civil penalty based on amounts recovered under Sec. 1132(a)(5) is not applicable.  Cofiduciary breaches aside,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> it is difficult to imagine any case where knowing participation in a fiduciary breach by a nonfiduciary would occasion the type of remedy (restitution awards) that would trigger Sec. 1132(l )(1)(B) without the nonfiduciary having engaged in a prohibited transaction under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1106<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> or otherwise having obtained some ill-gotten plan assets in a manner not covered by the prohibited transaction section.  We conclude, therefore, that Sec. 1132(l ) makes little sense as independently authorizing equitable relief against nonfiduciaries like Gorman, who allegedly participated in a fiduciary breach but did not engage in an act prohibited by the statute or otherwise obtain plan assets, when it can never be used for such relief.  If Sec. 1132(l ) fails to demonstrate Congressional intent to provide money damages for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach, see id. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2070-71, it is even less likely to demonstrate Congressional intent to provide nonmonetary equitable remedies for nonfiduciary participation in a fiduciary breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's interpretation of Sec. 1132(a)(5) as authorizing an actionable claim in any situation where an ERISA violation has occurred and the Secretary thinks relief is \"appropriate,\" regardless of whether or not that relief is directed at an act or practice addressed by the substantive provisions of the statute, stretches the language of Sec. 502(a)(5) past its breaking point.  For this reason and because we decline to exercise our common lawmaking authority or our inherent equitable powers in situations where a professional service provider assists in a fiduciary breach but receives no ill-gotten plan assets, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 29 U.S.C.

Section 1132(l ) was added to ERISA in 1989, see Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-239, Sec. 2101, 103 Stat. 2123.  Instead of extending the substantive reach of ERISA, Sec. 1132(l ) explicitly based its penalty on amounts already recoverable under existing provisions of the statute.  29 U.S.C.

Although fiduciary breaches also violate ERISA, nonfiduciaries cannot, by definition, engage in the act or practice of breaching a fiduciary duty.
