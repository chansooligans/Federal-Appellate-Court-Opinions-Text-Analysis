This case – according to Wojciech\n\nBielunas – is about life-altering pain.                    Working as a commercial\n\nfisherman aboard the F/V SEA WATCHER I, Bielunas had his right foot\n\ncrushed in a ghastly accident.               An orthopedic surgeon said it\n\nlooked like someone had taken a sledgehammer to Bielunas's foot.\n\nHis livelihood lost, Bielunas later sued the vessel's owner, F/V\n\nMisty        Dawn,   Inc.,     charging      Jones     Act     negligence,1     ship\n\nunseaworthiness, and a right to maintenance and cure.2                        A jury\n\nreturned a verdict in Bielunas's favor, and the district judge\n\nentered judgment against Misty Dawn for $2,307,690. In this arena,\n\nMisty Dawn criticizes the district judge for admitting certain\n\nevidence       and   denying    a   motion   for     new    trial   or   remittitur.\n\nDetecting no hint of reversible error, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\n                                     Background\n\n     We present the facts in the light most flattering to the\n\njury's verdict.        See, e.g., Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera, 431 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 2005).          Bielunas emigrated from Poland to the United\n\nStates with his family in 1995, eventually settling in rural\n\nPennsylvania.         He had worked on fishing boats before leaving\n\n\n        1\n            46 U.S.C. § 30104.\n        2\n       A venerable remedy created to protect seamen from the\ndangers of living and laboring at sea, maintenance and cure \"refers\nto the provision of, or payment for, food and lodging\n('maintenance') as well as any necessary health-care expenses\n('cure') incurred during the period of recovery from an injury or\nmalady.\" LeBlanc v. B.G.T. Corp., 992 F.2d 394, 396-97 (1st Cir.\n1993).\n\fPoland, and he became a commercial fisherman here.                  From 2005\n\nthrough 2006, Bielunas worked for Misty Dawn, a Massachusetts\n\ncorporation, on its vessel, the SEA WATCHER.\n\n       Safety was hardly the watchword for Misty Dawn's conduct. The\n\ncompany made no real effort to ensure that its employees complied\n\nwith    accepted   safety    standards.     Misty   Dawn    had   some   safety\n\nguidelines, but they were not posted anywhere on the SEA WATCHER.\n\nInstead,    the    company   relied   on   word-of-mouth,    with   ownership\n\npassing safety concerns to the captain who then passed them on to\n\nthe crew.    But there is some dispute whether ownership ever did\n\nthis.\n\n       To make the venture as profitable as possible, Misty Dawn\n\nstored clam cages on the walkways. With the walkways blocked, crew\n\nmembers looking to traverse the ship had to sidle along a thin,\n\nunguarded ledge overlooking a nine-foot drop into the cargo hold or\n\namble over a conveyor belt.           But the conveyor belt was not a\n\nrealistic option because the belt was quite slippery and the system\n\nlacked adequate handrails, so the crew (including the captain)\n\nopted to shimmy along the hatch ledge.         Apparently no one told them\n\nnot to do this.\n\n       That brings us to the accident.       Asked to help close the hatch\n\nthat covered the cargo hold, Bielunas had to indicate to another\n\ncrew member when the cover was in the proper position – a wire\n\ncable attached to a hydraulically-powered machine would haul the\n\nhatch forward along the ledge. Ideally, one would perform this job\n\fby standing on the designated walkways.         But because they were\n\nblocked, Bielunas rode atop the closing hatch cover – that is how\n\nhe and others had done it before, and no one had ever told him to\n\ndo it differently.      Unfortunately, he lost his balance, stepped\n\nonto the ledge to keep from falling into the cargo hold, and got\n\nhis right foot caught between the cover and a protruding piece of\n\nmetal.     \"Stop, stop,\" Bielunas yelled, hoping to get the attention\n\nof   the    seaman   operating   the   hydraulically-powered   machine.\n\nBielunas could feel steel pressing into him, crushing his foot.\n\nFlesh and muscle were stripped off the bone, leaving a gaping hole.\n\nBlood was everywhere.\n\n     The Coast Guard airlifted Bielunas to a hospital on Cape Cod,\n\nwhere a doctor performed a series of emergency surgeries.          The\n\ndoctor noticed that about half of the bone material was dead.       He\n\nremoved the dead matter and a significant amount of dead muscle and\n\ntissue, too, but he could not close the wound.       Eventually, after\n\nnearly two months, doctors sealed the opening, but Bielunas's foot\n\nis still disfigured, and the damage is severe, permanent, and\n\ndegenerative.     As if this were not enough, Bielunas walks with a\n\npronounced limp, and his altered gait triggered back and knee\n\nproblems.\n\n     Bielunas will never be able to return to any form of hard\n\nwork.    His poor English skills make it highly unlikely that he will\n\never be able to do office or clerical work.       Because this work is\n\nthe only kind of employment that a person with his new physical\n\fdisability would be capable of performing, Bielunas will likely\n\nnever be able to work again – he can even cross-off pizza delivery\n\nand security guard from any list of potential jobs because his\n\nmangled foot affects his driving and ability to patrol a site, too.\n\n     Bielunas's total medical and economic damages approximated\n\n$762,000.   In his opening statement, Bielunas's lawyer pushed for\n\na $2,500,000 damages award, which he upped to $3,328,767 in his\n\nclosing. The jury returned a $2,775,000 verdict against Misty Dawn\n\nbut also found Bielunas 15% comparatively negligent.   Factoring in\n\nthe 15% figure and an agreed-upon set-off between the parties, the\n\ndistrict judge entered a $2,307,690 judgment in Bielunas's favor.\n\nMisty Dawn moved for a new trial or a remittitur, which the\n\ndistrict denied in an unexplained order.\n\n     With this background in place, we turn to the issues presented\n\non appeal, highlighting further facts when needed to put Misty\n\nDawn's claims into proper perspective.\n\n                        Evidentiary Issues\n\n     Misty Dawn contends that the district judge erred in admitting\n\nplaintiff's exhibit 32 and Lawson Bronson's expert testimony.\n\nNeither claim has traction.\n\n     Plaintiff's exhibit 32\n\n     The protested exhibit is a staged photo (apparently taken by\n\na defense expert) of a deckhand holding a wire and sidling along a\n\nnine-inch hatch ledge, as the SEA WATCHER's crew frequently would.\n\nMisty Dawn argues here, as it did below, that the exhibit is\n\firrelevant because Bielunas was injured while standing on the\n\nmoving hatch cover – not while traveling along the hatch ledge\n\nholding a wire.    This argument is easily disposed of.\n\n     A relevancy-based argument is usually a tough sell.        The\n\ndefinition of relevance is quite expansive:    relevant evidence is\n\n\"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\n\nthat is of consequence\" more or less probable.    See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n401 (emphasis added).      To be relevant, the evidence need not\n\ndefinitively resolve a key issue in the case, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Rivera Calderón, 578 F.3d 78, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2009),\n\ncert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1107 (2010) – it need only move the\n\ninquiry forward to some degree, see 2 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret\n\nA. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 401.04[2][b] (Joseph M.\n\nMcLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2010).     Because this is a quintessential\n\njudgment call, see Morales Feliciano v. Rullán, 378 F.3d 42, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), we give trial judges considerable leeway in\n\ndeciding whether the contested evidence satisfies this not-too-\n\ndifficult-to-meet standard, reversing only on a showing of abuse of\n\ndiscretion, see, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n\n1194 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     Relevancy is not assessed in a vacuum – it is gauged \"in light\n\nof the underlying substantive law,\" see Roy v. The Austin   Co., 194\n\nF.3d 840, 843 (7th Cir. 1999), here, Jones Act negligence and ship\n\nunseaworthiness.   A Jones Act shipowner must see \"to the safety of\n\nthe crew.\"   Koehler v. Presque-Isle Transp. Co., 141 F.2d 490, 491\n\f(2d Cir. 1944) (Frank, J.).          A crew member's burden of proving\n\ncausation is \"featherweight,\" meaning liability exists if the\n\nshipowner's \"negligence contributed even in the slightest\" to the\n\ninjury.     Ferrara v. A. & V. Fishing, Inc., 99 F.3d 449, 453 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (quotation marks omitted).          Also, a shipowner must keep\n\nthe ship – its decks, passageways, equipment, etc. – in a seaworthy\n\ncondition and must use safe work methods, too.              See id.     And a\n\nshipowner is responsible for unseaworthiness-induced injuries even\n\nif not negligent.      See id.\n\n     If a picture speaks a thousand words, this one spoke plenty,\n\ngiving context so the jury could better understand the parties'\n\nactions.    Again, the photo showed a seaman inching his way along a\n\ntiny hatch ledge with no guardrails while lugging a wire – an\n\nunacceptable practice, Bielunas's expert said, which Misty Dawn\n\nturned a blind eye to and which highlighted Misty Dawn's cavalier\n\nattitude toward safety.      The photo also showed a ship with blocked\n\nwalkways, which further bolstered Bielunas's theory that Misty Dawn\n\nfailed to provide a safe deck for work on the high seas.                Misty\n\nDawn talked a good game about how crew safety was a top concern,\n\nbut the photo suggested otherwise.           Seen in this light, then, the\n\nphoto   tended   to   make   Misty   Dawn's    negligence   and   the   ship's\n\nunseaworthiness more probable, see generally DeGioia v. United\n\nStates Lines Co., 304 F.2d 421, 423 (2d Cir. 1962) (holding that a\n\ncluttered    deck     constitutes    Jones    Act   negligence    and   vessel\n\nunseaworthiness); Bonnewell v. United States, 170 F.2d 411, 412-13\n\f(4th Cir. 1948) (same) – which is all the liberal relevancy\n\nstandard requires, see, e.g., Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     Consequently, the district judge did not abuse\n\nhis broad discretion in admitting plaintiff's exhibit 32.\n\n     Bronson's testimony\n\n     Also sailing wide of the mark is Misty Dawn's claim that the\n\ndistrict judge stumbled in admitting Bronson's testimony about the\n\nmeans   of   traversing   the   deck,   the   danger   of   obstructing    the\n\nwalkways, and other safety problems on the SEA WATCHER. Misty Dawn\n\ncalls this testimony irrelevant and says its admission affected the\n\nverdict (Misty Dawn does not contest Bronson's expert credentials)\n\n– which means we apply the abuse-of-discretion standard.                  See,\n\ne.g., Pagés-Ramírez v. Ramírez-González, 605 F.3d 109, 115-16 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).     Again, that standard is hard to satisfy, and Misty\n\nDawn cannot satisfy it here.\n\n     Bronson's testimony – discussing the meaning and significance\n\nof the staged photo, the dangers posed by the open hatch covers and\n\nthe missing conveyor belt handrails, etc. – went to matters of\n\nconsequence:     did Misty Dawn provide Bielunas with a safe work\n\nplace, and was the SEA WATCHER seaworthy? Misty Dawn protests that\n\nBielunas was not hurt while sidling along the hatch ledge (a Misty\n\nDawn-accepted practice that Bronson condemned), that only one cover\n\nwas open when tragedy struck, and that the missing handrails played\n\nno part in the mishap (ignoring that Misty Dawn had faulted\n\nBielunas for not standing on the conveyor belt during the hatch-\n\fclosing episode, a ridiculously unsafe suggestion, Bronson said,\n\ngiven the lack of handrails).      But this evidence gave the jury a\n\nproper frame of reference for assessing the parties' competing\n\nclaims, so it is relevant.      See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 81\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    Misty Dawn could and did fight tooth and nail to\n\nundermine the evidence's meaning.        But once relevancy is found,\n\ncomplaints of the sort Misty Dawn pursues go to the weight, not the\n\nadmissibility, of Bronson's testimony. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nSchultz, 333 F.3d 393, 416 (2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Diaz,\n\n878 F.2d 608, 615 (2d Cir. 1989).       The upshot of all this is that\n\nwe do not see anything close to an abuse of discretion here.3\n\n                   The New Trial/Remittitur Issues\n\n     In   its   post-trial   motion,   Misty   Dawn   blasted   Bielunas's\n\ncounsel for suggesting a damage award in his opening statement\n\n($2,500,000) and closing argument ($3,328,767), saying counsel's\n\ncomments unfairly influenced the jury and entitled it to a new\n\ntrial.    Misty Dawn also contended that the jury's ultimate award\n\n($2,775,000,    constituting   roughly    $2,000,000    in   non-economic\n\n\n     3\n       Because there was no error, we need not consider Misty\nDawn's grumble that the admission of Bronson's testimony affected\nthe trial's outcome, see Fed. R. Evid. 103 – a complaint that turns\nin part on Misty Dawn's claim that Bielunas's counsel weaved\nBronson's \"irrelevant\" testimony into his closing argument. Misty\nDawn's brief focuses on the evidentiary issue (which falters, given\nhow easily Bronson's testimony clears the low relevancy hurdle) and\nmakes no attempt to construct a reasoned argument that Bielunas's\ncounsel's closing constituted misconduct, so our work on this is\ndone. See, e.g., McCullen v. Coakley, 571 F.3d 167, 182 & n.3 (1st\nCir. 2009) (deeming waived arguments hinted at but not developed\nand addressed to a particular theory), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.\n1881 (2010).\n\fdamages, which is the crux of the matter) was simply too large to\n\nstand. The district judge denied the motion without comment, so we\n\nhave two choices:         remand for clarification or address the issue\n\nhead-on   \"if    a     reasonable    basis    supporting   the   order    is   made\n\nmanifest on the record.\"            United States v. Podolsky, 158 F.3d 12,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 1998); see also generally Presley v. United States\n\nPostal Serv., 317 F.3d 167, 173 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that\n\n\"[w]hile a written explanation of a district court's basis for\n\ndenying [a new-trial motion] is certainly preferable as an aid to\n\nappellate review, a separate written opinion is not necessarily\n\nrequired when a district court\" rebuffs the motion).                     We choose\n\noption two in this instance.\n\n     Suggesting specific damage amount\n\n     Misty      Dawn    did   not    object   to   the   specific-damage-award\n\ncomments in Bielunas's counsel's opening statement and closing\n\nsummation.      Rather, it first surfaced this issue in its new-trial\n\nmotion.    That is still an unpreserved challenge, however, so our\n\nreview is limited to a search for plain error.               United States v.\n\nBrandao, 539 F.3d 44, 57 (1st Cir. 2008); accord Springer v. Henry,\n\n435 F.3d 268, 283 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n     Plain error is one hard test to meet, particularly in civil\n\nlitigation.      See Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).    Plain error is (1) error which (2) is so clear that a trial\n\njudge should act even without an objection and which (3) affects\n\nthe appellant's substantial rights – on top of that, even if the\n\fappellant makes this required showing, we need not intervene unless\n\nthe error also (4) seriously impugns the \"fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"   United States v. Roy,\n\n506 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nSmith, 177 F.3d at 25; Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA\n\nv. West Lake Acad., 548 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2008).   Consequently,\n\nMisty Dawn faces a steep climb nearing 90 degrees – ultimately,\n\nthat slope is insurmountable.\n\n     Misty Dawn cites no First Circuit cases banning lawyers from\n\nsuggesting a damage number to the jury.       Instead it says that\n\nfederal courts tend to let counsel make unit-of-time arguments\n\nduring summation (e.g., a lawyer tells the jury plaintiff's pain is\n\nworth X dollars per day, month, or year and then multiplies it by\n\nplaintiff's life expectancy to get a lump-sum figure).   Bielunas's\n\nlawyer did just that, proposing a number and discussing a process\n\nthrough which the jury could reach it.4\n\n\n     4\n       Here is a sampling of what Bielunas's counsel said (again,\nwithout drawing any objection):\n     Past and future physical pain and suffering:      Noting that\nthere are 365 days in a year, counsel suggested $282,000 for \"past\nphysical pain and suffering\" – $200,000 for the first year (given\nthe immediate \"horror\" of the calamity), $50,000 for the second\nyear, and $32,000 for the third.     Bielunas is \"55 years old,\"\ncounsel added, and is expected to live another 25 years, so \"you\nshould award him $800,000 for future physical pain and suffering\nbecause he's going to live with that [pain] every day.\"\n     Past and future mental anguish: \"I think the mental anguish\nof this thing is conservatively $20,000 a year,\" counsel said.\n\"That's $20,000 a year for the last three years\" and \"for the rest\nof his life,\" counsel added, which comes to $560,000.\n     Past and future disability and inconvenience:      Bielunas's\n\"past disability is permanent,\" counsel argued. \"And I submit to\nyou that $33,000 a year\" is a good number to cover \"the impairment\n\f     Some courts permit unit-of-time arguments, some leave the\n\nmatter to the trial judge's discretion, and some ban the practice\n\noutright – though most courts, particularly federal courts, seem to\n\nfall into the first two camps.          See generally Mileski v. Long\n\nIsland R.R. Co., 499 F.2d 1169, 1173 n.2, n.3, n.4 (2d Cir. 1974)\n\n(collecting    federal   and    state   cases);   Giant    Food   Inc.   v.\n\nSatterfield, 603 A.2d 877, 879-80 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1992) (same).\n\nNot this Court, however.       We forbid counsel from asking jurors to\n\nconsider the amount of a party's ad damnum in crafting a damage\n\naward, see Davis v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 898 F.2d 836,\n\n837-38 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Wilson v. Bradlees of New England,\n\nInc., 250 F.3d 10, 23 n.25 (1st Cir. 2001) – and we have cited\n\napprovingly a case outside this circuit for the point that lawyers\n\ncannot state in summation the number they think jurors should award\n\nfor pain and suffering.    See Davis, 898 F.2d at 837 (highlighting\n\nWaldorf v. Shuta, 896 F.2d 723 (3d Cir. 1990)).           Building on this\n\nfoundation, we held in an unpublished opinion that Davis precludes\n\ncounsel from requesting a pain-and-suffering dollar amount in\n\nclosing.     Kimberly F. v. Mary Hitchcock Mem. Hosp. & Hitchcock\n\nClinics, Inc., No. 93-1438, 1993 WL 498026, at *9-10 (1st Cir. Dec.\n\n3, 1993) (unpublished).    Consistent with the Davis line of cases,\n\ndistrict judges in this circuit have stopped lawyers from doing\n\njust that.    See Wilson, 250 F.3d at 23 n.25; see also generally\n\nBudet-Correa v. United Parcel Serv., 322 F.Supp.2d 139, 141-42\n\n\nand the inconvenience,\" which comes to $924,000.\n\f(D.P.R.     2004)   (discussing       and    applying       Davis    and     the   like).\n\nConsequently, measured by our precedents we conclude that the\n\ndistrict judge here made a mistake, and that the mistake is obvious\n\nenough.     But, again, plain error requires more:                  the mistake must\n\nalso   be    prejudicial    in    a   sense        that    there    is   a    reasonable\n\nprobability (not just a theoretical possibility) that it affected\n\nthe result, and the result must be unjust, too.                     See United States\n\nv. Marcus, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 2164 (2010); see also United States v.\n\nPadilla,     415    F.3d   211,   225       (1st    Cir.    2005)    (Boudin,       C.J.,\n\nconcurring) (en banc).        This is where Misty Dawn gets tripped up.\n\n       For starters, we are not convinced that this was a game-\n\nchanging error.      Cf. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (stressing that the plain-error doctrine focuses on\n\n\"blockbuster[]\" errors) (quotation marks omitted).                           We question\n\nwhether Misty Dawn can show that it is reasonably probable – as\n\nopposed to merely possible – that the jury would have fixed a\n\ndifferent damage figure absent the unit-of-time breakdown.                           That\n\nthe jury found Bielunas 15% comparatively negligent as opposed to\n\nthe 5% his lawyer had argued for suggests that the jury did not\n\nblindly adopt counsel's analysis.              But we need not dwell on this\n\nissue.      See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 469 (1997)\n\n(skipping over the third component of the plain-error test and\n\ndeciding the case on the fourth prong).                    Assuming for argument's\n\nsake that the breakdown affected the outcome of the case, we see no\n\ninjustice here:        given that Bielunas will live out his life in\n\fpain, deprived of his livelihood (details we delve more deeply into\n\nbelow), we cannot say that the award is intolerable.\n\n     If more were needed – and we doubt that it is – the judge in\n\nhis charge made clear that the lawyers' statements and arguments\n\nwere not evidence and that the verdict must be reached on the\n\nevidence alone. Misty Dawn's counsel did not object or request any\n\ninstruction on the unit-of-time issue.     After deliberating for a\n\nbit, the jury asked the judge if Bielunas's lawyer could go over\n\nthe \"suggested award amounts\" and the \"reasoning\" used to reach\n\nthem.   Misty Dawn's attorney asked the judge to remind the jurors\n\nthat arguments were not evidence in the case and that they are \"to\n\ndecide\" the matter \"on their own.\"    The judge agreed and told the\n\njury:\n\n          I presume that you are referring to the plaintiff's\n     counsel's argument to you where it was all laid out. I\n     am not going to have him do that again nor should he have\n     to do it again.\n          What I want you to do is to use your collective\n     memories as to what he said and what reasoning . . . he\n     offered for the conclusions that he suggested to you.\n     And have in mind . . . what I told you before, that\n     statements of counsel . . . are not the evidence in the\n     case. You are supposed to remember what the evidence\n     was.\n          What counsel was endeavoring to do was to remind you\n     of what the evidence was and put his interpretation\n     before you so you could consider it.      So that is the\n     answer to that. You are to try to remember the evidence\n     yourself.\n\nMisty Dawn's lawyer did not object or ask the judge to say anything\n\nelse, and we think the judge's instructions help undercut any\n\nplain-error claim.     See United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387,\n\n398 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\f      Plain error is not an \"appellant-friendly\" standard, United\n\nStates v. Vazquez-Molina, 389 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated\n\non other grounds 544 U.S. 946 (2005), and rightfully so:              it keeps\n\nparties from rolling the dice on a favorable verdict and then\n\nraising problems on appeal that could have been easily fixed with\n\na timely objection below.      See, e.g., United States v. Jacquillon,\n\n469 F.2d 380, 386 (5th Cir. 1972) (Wisdom, J.).           Ultimately, that\n\nstandard – which is exceedingly tough to meet – cannot be met here.\n\n      The damage amount\n\n      As a parting shot, Misty Dawn calls the jury's non-economic\n\ndamage award (over $2,000,000) unreasonably high and faults the\n\ndistrict judge for not ordering a remittitur.                 We see things\n\ndifferently.\n\n      Converting legal damages into a monetary award is the jury's\n\njob – consequently, only rarely and in extraordinary circumstances\n\nwill we veto the jury's decision. Casillas-Díaz v. Palau, 463 F.3d\n\n77, 82-83 (1st Cir. 2006).         That is particularly true when the\n\ndistrict judge, who saw and heard the evidence play out, refuses to\n\ntrim the award.       Id. at 83.      Stepping lightly, we review that\n\nruling for abuse of discretion, reversing only if the defendant\n\ncarries the weighty burden of proving that the contested award is\n\n\"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the\n\ncourt, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it\n\nto stand.\"   Id. (quotation marks omitted).       This means that we will\n\nnot   jettison   a   damage   award   simply   because   we   think    it   too\n\fgenerous, see Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 15-16, but will reverse \"only\n\nif it is shown to exceed any rational appraisal or estimate of the\n\ndamages that could be based upon the evidence before the jury.\"\n\nCasillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n     There is no mathematical formula for determining the monetary\n\nequivalent of non-economic injuries.   See, e.g., Limone v. United\n\nStates, 579 F.3d 79, 105 (1st Cir. 2009).   But the district judge\n\ntold the jurors, without objection, that they could consider any\n\nphysical, mental, or emotional pain Bielunas has suffered, is\n\nsuffering, and will suffer because of his wounds.   Damages must be\n\nreasonable and not based on hunches, the judge stressed, but \"no\n\nevidence of value\" is needed for the intangible injuries:       in\n\ntranslating a decision into dollars, \"you are not determining value\n\nbut you should award an amount that you feel will fully and fairly\n\ncompensate\" Bielunas for his past, present, and future mental\n\ndistress and physical pain. The issue, then, is inescapably \"fact-\n\nbound,\" see Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83, and the facts, measured\n\nunder the legal criteria outlined above, support the district\n\njudge's decision not to pare down the award.\n\n     Bielunas suffered unimaginable pain on the SEA WATCHER, and\n\npain clings to him still.    A multi-ton hatch cover crushed his\n\nfoot, pulverizing a bone, fracturing others in multiple places, and\n\nleaving the whole thing a bloodied mess.    The doctors could not\n\nclose the wound for the longest time, and they will never make him\n\nfully better – actually, things will only get worse.       And the\n\finjury has exacted quite a toll, causing him to lose many of the\n\nthings that made his life worth living.      No more working on a\n\nfishing boat – in fact, no more meaningful employment at all.     No\n\nmore taking long hikes with friends and family.        No more doing\n\ncertain chores around the house.    No more helping neighbors with\n\nhome-improvement projects.    All of this has left him feeling\n\npowerless, lost, and depressed.    He worries about his future, he\n\nlashes out at others, and his marriage has suffered, too.     Taking\n\neverything into account, we cannot say that the jury's award is\n\nunconnected to the evidence, conscience-shocking, or so lavish that\n\nit would offend common notions of justice if it stands – so no\n\nremittitur is needed.\n\n     Misty Dawn makes much of the fact that Bielunas does not take\n\npain medication and had fractured the heel on the same foot years\n\nbefore, an injury that Misty Dawn's expert suggested caused many of\n\nthe same problems that Bielunas complains about now.    None of this\n\nchanges our view of the case, however.   Again, Bielunas explained\n\nin exquisite detail how much pain he had after the hatch cover tore\n\na hole in his foot and how much pain he has now – constant, he\n\nsaid, even though he avoids pain pills, and the medical evidence\n\nbacks up his chronic-pain claim.   As to the heel issue, Bielunas\n\nnever missed a day of work because of that injury, a fact that\n\npours cold water on the expert testimony that Misty Dawn points to\n\n– testimony that the jury could, and evidently did, disbelieve in\n\nany event.   Cf. Primus v. Galgano, 329 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.\n\f2003).\n\n       Citing to Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Serv., Inc., 17 F.3d 490\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), and Laaperi v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 787 F.2d 726\n\n(1st Cir. 1986), Misty Dawn also argues that because we rejected\n\njury awards there, we should do so here.    But these cases offer no\n\naid.     For one thing, they are 16 and 24 years old, respectively,\n\nwhich in this context makes them \"not particularly helpful\" for\n\ncomparison purposes, see Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 16 (saying so with\n\nrespect to a 16-year-old precedent).    For another thing, they are\n\neasily distinguishable from this case.     Anthony found a $566,765\n\npain-and-suffering award unconscionable because the plaintiff's\n\ninjury – which was neither painful (relatively speaking) nor\n\npermanent – did not \"render[] him unable to perform any particular\n\nfunctions or engage in any particular activities [or] otherwise\n\ninterfere[] with his professional, recreational, or personal life.\"\n\nAnthony, 17 F.3d at 491, 494-95.     Laaperi considered a $750,000\n\ndamage award conscience-shocking because the plaintiff suffered\n\n\"relatively minor injuries, involving no continuing disability\"\n\n(other than \"a non-disabling permanent scar on her lower back,\n\nthere was no evidence of any medical problems whatsoever within a\n\nmonth and a half\" after the incident).     Laaperi, 787 F.2d at 734-\n\n36.    Anthony and Laaperi look nothing like this case, given the\n\nhuge toll Bielunas's injury has taken on his body and mind.\n\n       Misty Dawn also highlights a boatload of non-First Circuit\n\ncases where lower courts deemed certain damage awards excessive.\n\fMeasured against these cases, Misty Dawn says, the objected-to\n\nportion of Bielunas's damage award is legally unsustainable.          Not\n\nso: simply \"showing that the damage award is generous in comparison\n\nto other (hand-picked) cases is insufficient to warrant relief.\"\n\nCorrea v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1198 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (citing Havinga v. Crowley Towing & Transp. Co., 24 F.3d\n\n1480, 1488-89 (1st Cir. 1994) (not necessary to compare cases\n\ninvolving dissimilar traumas, dates and locations of trials, and\n\nevidence presented)); accord Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 16 (stressing\n\nthat we will not reject a damage award \"merely because the amount\n\nof the award is somewhat out of line with other cases of a similar\n\nnature\")   (quotation   marks    omitted).   Ultimately,   we   see    no\n\ncompelling reason to override the jury's judgment here.5\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons arrayed above, we reject Misty Dawn's appeal\n\nand affirm the judgment below in all respects.       Each side shall\n\nbear its own costs.\n\n     So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The parties also spar over whether Bielunas's counsel told\nMisty Dawn's lawyer in a phone call that the award's size \"shocked\"\nboth him and his client. That makes not one whit of difference:\nwhat counts is whether the award shocks our conscience (it does\nnot), not whether it shocks counsel's or his client's.\n\f",

This case – according to Wojciech\n\nBielunas – is about life-altering pain.                    Working as a commercial\n\nfisherman aboard the F/V SEA WATCHER I, Bielunas had his right foot\n\ncrushed in a ghastly accident.               An orthopedic surgeon said it\n\nlooked like someone had taken a sledgehammer to Bielunas's foot.\n\nHis livelihood lost, Bielunas later sued the vessel's owner, F/V\n\nMisty        Dawn,   Inc.,     charging      Jones     Act     negligence,1     ship\n\nunseaworthiness, and a right to maintenance and cure.2                        A jury\n\nreturned a verdict in Bielunas's favor, and the district judge\n\nentered judgment against Misty Dawn for $2,307,690. In this arena,\n\nMisty Dawn criticizes the district judge for admitting certain\n\nevidence       and   denying    a   motion   for     new    trial   or   remittitur.\n\nDetecting no hint of reversible error, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\n                                     Background\n\n     We present the facts in the light most flattering to the\n\njury's verdict.        See, e.g., Whitfield v.

Bielunas emigrated from Poland to the United\n\nStates with his family in 1995, eventually settling in rural\n\nPennsylvania.         He had worked on fishing boats before leaving\n\n\n        1\n            46 U.S.C. § 30104.\n        2\n       A venerable remedy created to protect seamen from the\ndangers of living and laboring at sea, maintenance and cure \"refers\nto the provision of, or payment for, food and lodging\n('maintenance') as well as any necessary health-care expenses\n('cure') incurred during the period of recovery from an injury or\nmalady.\" LeBlanc v.

From 2005\n\nthrough 2006, Bielunas worked for Misty Dawn, a Massachusetts\n\ncorporation, on its vessel, the SEA WATCHER.\n\n       Safety was hardly the watchword for Misty Dawn's conduct. The\n\ncompany made no real effort to ensure that its employees complied\n\nwith    accepted   safety    standards.     Misty   Dawn    had   some   safety\n\nguidelines, but they were not posted anywhere on the SEA WATCHER.\n\nInstead,    the    company   relied   on   word-of-mouth,    with   ownership\n\npassing safety concerns to the captain who then passed them on to\n\nthe crew.    But there is some dispute whether ownership ever did\n\nthis.\n\n       To make the venture as profitable as possible, Misty Dawn\n\nstored clam cages on the walkways. With the walkways blocked, crew\n\nmembers looking to traverse the ship had to sidle along a thin,\n\nunguarded ledge overlooking a nine-foot drop into the cargo hold or\n\namble over a conveyor belt.           But the conveyor belt was not a\n\nrealistic option because the belt was quite slippery and the system\n\nlacked adequate handrails, so the crew (including the captain)\n\nopted to shimmy along the hatch ledge.         Apparently no one told them\n\nnot to do this.\n\n       That brings us to the accident.       Asked to help close the hatch\n\nthat covered the cargo hold, Bielunas had to indicate to another\n\ncrew member when the cover was in the proper position – a wire\n\ncable attached to a hydraulically-powered machine would haul the\n\nhatch forward along the ledge. Ideally, one would perform this job\n\fby standing on the designated walkways.         But because they were\n\nblocked, Bielunas rode atop the closing hatch cover – that is how\n\nhe and others had done it before, and no one had ever told him to\n\ndo it differently.      Unfortunately, he lost his balance, stepped\n\nonto the ledge to keep from falling into the cargo hold, and got\n\nhis right foot caught between the cover and a protruding piece of\n\nmetal.     \"Stop, stop,\" Bielunas yelled, hoping to get the attention\n\nof   the    seaman   operating   the   hydraulically-powered   machine.\n\nBielunas could feel steel pressing into him, crushing his foot.\n\nFlesh and muscle were stripped off the bone, leaving a gaping hole.\n\nBlood was everywhere.\n\n     The Coast Guard airlifted Bielunas to a hospital on Cape Cod,\n\nwhere a doctor performed a series of emergency surgeries.          The\n\ndoctor noticed that about half of the bone material was dead.       He\n\nremoved the dead matter and a significant amount of dead muscle and\n\ntissue, too, but he could not close the wound.       Eventually, after\n\nnearly two months, doctors sealed the opening, but Bielunas's foot\n\nis still disfigured, and the damage is severe, permanent, and\n\ndegenerative.     As if this were not enough, Bielunas walks with a\n\npronounced limp, and his altered gait triggered back and knee\n\nproblems.\n\n     Bielunas will never be able to return to any form of hard\n\nwork.    His poor English skills make it highly unlikely that he will\n\never be able to do office or clerical work.       Because this work is\n\nthe only kind of employment that a person with his new physical\n\fdisability would be capable of performing, Bielunas will likely\n\nnever be able to work again – he can even cross-off pizza delivery\n\nand security guard from any list of potential jobs because his\n\nmangled foot affects his driving and ability to patrol a site, too.\n\n     Bielunas's total medical and economic damages approximated\n\n$762,000.   In his opening statement, Bielunas's lawyer pushed for\n\na $2,500,000 damages award, which he upped to $3,328,767 in his\n\nclosing. The jury returned a $2,775,000 verdict against Misty Dawn\n\nbut also found Bielunas 15% comparatively negligent.   Factoring in\n\nthe 15% figure and an agreed-upon set-off between the parties, the\n\ndistrict judge entered a $2,307,690 judgment in Bielunas's favor.\n\nMisty Dawn moved for a new trial or a remittitur, which the\n\ndistrict denied in an unexplained order.\n\n     With this background in place, we turn to the issues presented\n\non appeal, highlighting further facts when needed to put Misty\n\nDawn's claims into proper perspective.\n\n                        Evidentiary Issues\n\n     Misty Dawn contends that the district judge erred in admitting\n\nplaintiff's exhibit 32 and Lawson Bronson's expert testimony.\n\nNeither claim has traction.\n\n     Plaintiff's exhibit 32\n\n     The protested exhibit is a staged photo (apparently taken by\n\na defense expert) of a deckhand holding a wire and sidling along a\n\nnine-inch hatch ledge, as the SEA WATCHER's crew frequently would.\n\nMisty Dawn argues here, as it did below, that the exhibit is\n\firrelevant because Bielunas was injured while standing on the\n\nmoving hatch cover – not while traveling along the hatch ledge\n\nholding a wire.    This argument is easily disposed of.\n\n     A relevancy-based argument is usually a tough sell.        The\n\ndefinition of relevance is quite expansive:    relevant evidence is\n\n\"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\n\nthat is of consequence\" more or less probable.    See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n401 (emphasis added).      To be relevant, the evidence need not\n\ndefinitively resolve a key issue in the case, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v.

Again, the photo showed a seaman inching his way along a\n\ntiny hatch ledge with no guardrails while lugging a wire – an\n\nunacceptable practice, Bielunas's expert said, which Misty Dawn\n\nturned a blind eye to and which highlighted Misty Dawn's cavalier\n\nattitude toward safety.      The photo also showed a ship with blocked\n\nwalkways, which further bolstered Bielunas's theory that Misty Dawn\n\nfailed to provide a safe deck for work on the high seas.                Misty\n\nDawn talked a good game about how crew safety was a top concern,\n\nbut the photo suggested otherwise.

Consequently, the district judge did not abuse\n\nhis broad discretion in admitting plaintiff's exhibit 32.\n\n     Bronson's testimony\n\n     Also sailing wide of the mark is Misty Dawn's claim that the\n\ndistrict judge stumbled in admitting Bronson's testimony about the\n\nmeans   of   traversing   the   deck,   the   danger   of   obstructing    the\n\nwalkways, and other safety problems on the SEA WATCHER. Misty Dawn\n\ncalls this testimony irrelevant and says its admission affected the\n\nverdict (Misty Dawn does not contest Bronson's expert credentials)\n\n– which means we apply the abuse-of-discretion standard.                  See,\n\ne.g., Pagés-Ramírez v.

Again, that standard is hard to satisfy, and Misty\n\nDawn cannot satisfy it here.\n\n     Bronson's testimony – discussing the meaning and significance\n\nof the staged photo, the dangers posed by the open hatch covers and\n\nthe missing conveyor belt handrails, etc. – went to matters of\n\nconsequence:     did Misty Dawn provide Bielunas with a safe work\n\nplace, and was the SEA WATCHER seaworthy? Misty Dawn protests that\n\nBielunas was not hurt while sidling along the hatch ledge (a Misty\n\nDawn-accepted practice that Bronson condemned), that only one cover\n\nwas open when tragedy struck, and that the missing handrails played\n\nno part in the mishap (ignoring that Misty Dawn had faulted\n\nBielunas for not standing on the conveyor belt during the hatch-\n\fclosing episode, a ridiculously unsafe suggestion, Bronson said,\n\ngiven the lack of handrails).      But this evidence gave the jury a\n\nproper frame of reference for assessing the parties' competing\n\nclaims, so it is relevant.      See Faigin v.

Misty Dawn could and did fight tooth and nail to\n\nundermine the evidence's meaning.        But once relevancy is found,\n\ncomplaints of the sort Misty Dawn pursues go to the weight, not the\n\nadmissibility, of Bronson's testimony.

The upshot of all this is that\n\nwe do not see anything close to an abuse of discretion here.3\n\n                   The New Trial/Remittitur Issues\n\n     In   its   post-trial   motion,   Misty   Dawn   blasted   Bielunas's\n\ncounsel for suggesting a damage award in his opening statement\n\n($2,500,000) and closing argument ($3,328,767), saying counsel's\n\ncomments unfairly influenced the jury and entitled it to a new\n\ntrial.    Misty Dawn also contended that the jury's ultimate award\n\n($2,775,000,    constituting   roughly    $2,000,000    in   non-economic\n\n\n     3\n       Because there was no error, we need not consider Misty\nDawn's grumble that the admission of Bronson's testimony affected\nthe trial's outcome, see Fed. R. Evid. 103 – a complaint that turns\nin part on Misty Dawn's claim that Bielunas's counsel weaved\nBronson's \"irrelevant\" testimony into his closing argument. Misty\nDawn's brief focuses on the evidentiary issue (which falters, given\nhow easily Bronson's testimony clears the low relevancy hurdle) and\nmakes no attempt to construct a reasoned argument that Bielunas's\ncounsel's closing constituted misconduct, so our work on this is\ndone.

Consequently,\n\nMisty Dawn faces a steep climb nearing 90 degrees – ultimately,\n\nthat slope is insurmountable.\n\n     Misty Dawn cites no First Circuit cases banning lawyers from\n\nsuggesting a damage number to the jury.       Instead it says that\n\nfederal courts tend to let counsel make unit-of-time arguments\n\nduring summation (e.g., a lawyer tells the jury plaintiff's pain is\n\nworth X dollars per day, month, or year and then multiplies it by\n\nplaintiff's life expectancy to get a lump-sum figure).   Bielunas's\n\nlawyer did just that, proposing a number and discussing a process\n\nthrough which the jury could reach it.4\n\n\n     4\n       Here is a sampling of what Bielunas's counsel said (again,\nwithout drawing any objection):\n     Past and future physical pain and suffering:      Noting that\nthere are 365 days in a year, counsel suggested $282,000 for \"past\nphysical pain and suffering\" – $200,000 for the first year (given\nthe immediate \"horror\" of the calamity), $50,000 for the second\nyear, and $32,000 for the third.     Bielunas is \"55 years old,\"\ncounsel added, and is expected to live another 25 years, so \"you\nshould award him $800,000 for future physical pain and suffering\nbecause he's going to live with that [pain] every day.\"\n     Past and future mental anguish: \"I think the mental anguish\nof this thing is conservatively $20,000 a year,\" counsel said.\n\"That's $20,000 a year for the last three years\" and \"for the rest\nof his life,\" counsel added, which comes to $560,000.\n     Past and future disability and inconvenience:      Bielunas's\n\"past disability is permanent,\" counsel argued. \"And I submit to\nyou that $33,000 a year\" is a good number to cover \"the impairment\n\f     Some courts permit unit-of-time arguments, some leave the\n\nmatter to the trial judge's discretion, and some ban the practice\n\noutright – though most courts, particularly federal courts, seem to\n\nfall into the first two camps.

This is where Misty Dawn gets tripped up.\n\n       For starters, we are not convinced that this was a game-\n\nchanging error.      Cf. United States v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (stressing that the plain-error doctrine focuses on\n\n\"blockbuster[]\" errors) (quotation marks omitted).                           We question\n\nwhether Misty Dawn can show that it is reasonably probable – as\n\nopposed to merely possible – that the jury would have fixed a\n\ndifferent damage figure absent the unit-of-time breakdown.                           That\n\nthe jury found Bielunas 15% comparatively negligent as opposed to\n\nthe 5% his lawyer had argued for suggests that the jury did not\n\nblindly adopt counsel's analysis.              But we need not dwell on this\n\nissue.      See Johnson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469 (1997)\n\n(skipping over the third component of the plain-error test and\n\ndeciding the case on the fourth prong).                    Assuming for argument's\n\nsake that the breakdown affected the outcome of the case, we see no\n\ninjustice here:        given that Bielunas will live out his life in\n\fpain, deprived of his livelihood (details we delve more deeply into\n\nbelow), we cannot say that the award is intolerable.\n\n     If more were needed – and we doubt that it is – the judge in\n\nhis charge made clear that the lawyers' statements and arguments\n\nwere not evidence and that the verdict must be reached on the\n\nevidence alone. Misty Dawn's counsel did not object or request any\n\ninstruction on the unit-of-time issue.     After deliberating for a\n\nbit, the jury asked the judge if Bielunas's lawyer could go over\n\nthe \"suggested award amounts\" and the \"reasoning\" used to reach\n\nthem.   Misty Dawn's attorney asked the judge to remind the jurors\n\nthat arguments were not evidence in the case and that they are \"to\n\ndecide\" the matter \"on their own.\"    The judge agreed and told the\n\njury:\n\n          I presume that you are referring to the plaintiff's\n     counsel's argument to you where it was all laid out. I\n     am not going to have him do that again nor should he have\n     to do it again.\n          What I want you to do is to use your collective\n     memories as to what he said and what reasoning . . . he\n     offered for the conclusions that he suggested to you.\n     And have in mind . . . what I told you before, that\n     statements of counsel . . . are not the evidence in the\n     case. You are supposed to remember what the evidence\n     was.\n          What counsel was endeavoring to do was to remind you\n     of what the evidence was and put his interpretation\n     before you so you could consider it.      So that is the\n     answer to that. You are to try to remember the evidence\n     yourself.\n\nMisty Dawn's lawyer did not object or ask the judge to say anything\n\nelse, and we think the judge's instructions help undercut any\n\nplain-error claim.

Ultimately, that\n\nstandard – which is exceedingly tough to meet – cannot be met here.\n\n      The damage amount\n\n      As a parting shot, Misty Dawn calls the jury's non-economic\n\ndamage award (over $2,000,000) unreasonably high and faults the\n\ndistrict judge for not ordering a remittitur.                 We see things\n\ndifferently.\n\n      Converting legal damages into a monetary award is the jury's\n\njob – consequently, only rarely and in extraordinary circumstances\n\nwill we veto the jury's decision. Casillas-Díaz v. Palau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202419\"><a href=\"/opinion/202419/casillas-diaz-v-palau/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82-83 (1st Cir. 2006).         That is particularly true when the\n\ndistrict judge, who saw and heard the evidence play out, refuses to\n\ntrim the award.       Id. at 83.      Stepping lightly, we review that\n\nruling for abuse of discretion, reversing only if the defendant\n\ncarries the weighty burden of proving that the contested award is\n\n\"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the\n\ncourt, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it\n\nto stand.\"   Id. (quotation marks omitted).       This means that we will\n\nnot   jettison   a   damage   award   simply   because   we   think    it   too\n\fgenerous, see Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 15-16, but will reverse \"only\n\nif it is shown to exceed any rational appraisal or estimate of the\n\ndamages that could be based upon the evidence before the jury.\"\n\nCasillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n     There is no mathematical formula for determining the monetary\n\nequivalent of non-economic injuries.   See, e.g., Limone v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (1st Cir. 2009).   But the district judge\n\ntold the jurors, without objection, that they could consider any\n\nphysical, mental, or emotional pain Bielunas has suffered, is\n\nsuffering, and will suffer because of his wounds.   Damages must be\n\nreasonable and not based on hunches, the judge stressed, but \"no\n\nevidence of value\" is needed for the intangible injuries:       in\n\ntranslating a decision into dollars, \"you are not determining value\n\nbut you should award an amount that you feel will fully and fairly\n\ncompensate\" Bielunas for his past, present, and future mental\n\ndistress and physical pain. The issue, then, is inescapably \"fact-\n\nbound,\" see Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83, and the facts, measured\n\nunder the legal criteria outlined above, support the district\n\njudge's decision not to pare down the award.\n\n     Bielunas suffered unimaginable pain on the SEA WATCHER, and\n\npain clings to him still.    A multi-ton hatch cover crushed his\n\nfoot, pulverizing a bone, fracturing others in multiple places, and\n\nleaving the whole thing a bloodied mess.    The doctors could not\n\nclose the wound for the longest time, and they will never make him\n\nfully better – actually, things will only get worse.       And the\n\finjury has exacted quite a toll, causing him to lose many of the\n\nthings that made his life worth living.      No more working on a\n\nfishing boat – in fact, no more meaningful employment at all.     No\n\nmore taking long hikes with friends and family.        No more doing\n\ncertain chores around the house.    No more helping neighbors with\n\nhome-improvement projects.    All of this has left him feeling\n\npowerless, lost, and depressed.    He worries about his future, he\n\nlashes out at others, and his marriage has suffered, too.     Taking\n\neverything into account, we cannot say that the jury's award is\n\nunconnected to the evidence, conscience-shocking, or so lavish that\n\nit would offend common notions of justice if it stands – so no\n\nremittitur is needed.\n\n     Misty Dawn makes much of the fact that Bielunas does not take\n\npain medication and had fractured the heel on the same foot years\n\nbefore, an injury that Misty Dawn's expert suggested caused many of\n\nthe same problems that Bielunas complains about now.    None of this\n\nchanges our view of the case, however.   Again, Bielunas explained\n\nin exquisite detail how much pain he had after the hatch cover tore\n\na hole in his foot and how much pain he has now – constant, he\n\nsaid, even though he avoids pain pills, and the medical evidence\n\nbacks up his chronic-pain claim.   As to the heel issue, Bielunas\n\nnever missed a day of work because of that injury, a fact that\n\npours cold water on the expert testimony that Misty Dawn points to\n\n– testimony that the jury could, and evidently did, disbelieve in\n\nany event.

But these cases offer no\n\naid.     For one thing, they are 16 and 24 years old, respectively,\n\nwhich in this context makes them \"not particularly helpful\" for\n\ncomparison purposes, see Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 16 (saying so with\n\nrespect to a 16-year-old precedent).    For another thing, they are\n\neasily distinguishable from this case.     Anthony found a $566,765\n\npain-and-suffering award unconscionable because the plaintiff's\n\ninjury – which was neither painful (relatively speaking) nor\n\npermanent – did not \"render[] him unable to perform any particular\n\nfunctions or engage in any particular activities [or] otherwise\n\ninterfere[] with his professional, recreational, or personal life.\"\n\nAnthony, 17 F.3d at 491, 494-95.     Laaperi considered a $750,000\n\ndamage award conscience-shocking because the plaintiff suffered\n\n\"relatively minor injuries, involving no continuing disability\"\n\n(other than \"a non-disabling permanent scar on her lower back,\n\nthere was no evidence of any medical problems whatsoever within a\n\nmonth and a half\" after the incident).     Laaperi, 787 F.2d at 734-\n\n36.    Anthony and Laaperi look nothing like this case, given the\n\nhuge toll Bielunas's injury has taken on his body and mind.\n\n       Misty Dawn also highlights a boatload of non-First Circuit\n\ncases where lower courts deemed certain damage awards excessive.\n\fMeasured against these cases, Misty Dawn says, the objected-to\n\nportion of Bielunas's damage award is legally unsustainable.          Not\n\nso: simply \"showing that the damage award is generous in comparison\n\nto other (hand-picked) cases is insufficient to warrant relief.\"\n\nCorrea v.

Ultimately,   we   see    no\n\ncompelling reason to override the jury's judgment here.5\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons arrayed above, we reject Misty Dawn's appeal\n\nand affirm the judgment below in all respects.       Each side shall\n\nbear its own costs.\n\n     So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The parties also spar over whether Bielunas's counsel told\nMisty Dawn's lawyer in a phone call that the award's size \"shocked\"\nboth him and his client. That makes not one whit of difference:\nwhat counts is whether the award shocks our conscience (it does\nnot), not whether it shocks counsel's or his client's.\n\f</pre>",
