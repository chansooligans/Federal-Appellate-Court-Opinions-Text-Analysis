Plaintiff,  an  injured skier,\n                               \n\nargues  that a ski area operator negligently maintained a tree in\n\na particular  area of a Maine  ski slope and that  the ski resort\n\nnegligently  failed to post a warning sign alerting skiers to the\n\npresence  of a converging  trail.   Plaintiff alleges  that these\n\nnegligent acts proximately caused  him to suffer serious injuries\n\nin a skiing accident.  \n\n          Plaintiff  originally  brought a  five-count negligence\n\naction against  the ski resort seeking damages.   Two of the five\n\ncounts,  loss of  consortium  and emotional  distress brought  on\n\nbehalf of plaintiff's spouse,  were voluntarily dismissed.  Based\n\non  considerations of  state law,1  the district  court dismissed\n\ntwo more counts alleging negligent tree location or placement and\n\nslope  arrangement for failure to  state a claim  on which relief\n\ncould be granted.   Also, the court denied plaintiff's  motion to\n\namend  the  tree placement  count in  order to  allege additional\n\nfacts.   Finally, the district court found the warning-sign count\n\nadjudicable; however,  finding no  material fact was  in dispute,\n\n                       \n\n   1The Maine legislature enacted the Skiers' and Tramway\n   Passengers' Responsibilities Act, 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991),\n   to limit the liability of Maine's ski area operators.  The\n   statute provides that skiers assume risks while skiing on\n   the state's slopes and immunizes ski resorts from legal\n   responsibility for skiing injuries \"unless the injury or\n   death [is] actually caused by the negligent operation or\n                                                        \n   maintenance of the ski area by the ski area operator, its\n              \n   agents or employees.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Although the\n                            \n   statute itself does not define \"operation or maintenance,\"\n   the district court found issues of negligent slope design to\n                                                            \n   be outside the scope of the statute's liability limitation\n   exception.  Finnern v. Sunday River, Civil No. 91-0065-P-H,\n                                      \n   slip op. at 3 (D. Me. Nov. 28, 1991).\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nthe court granted summary  judgment -- in favor of  defendant ski\n\narea   operator.     Plaintiff  appeals   the  district   court's\n\ndismissals,  denial  of motion  to  amend,  and summary  judgment\n\ndecision.  For  reasons explained below,  we affirm the  district\n                                             affirm\n\ncourt in all relevant respects.\n\n                                I.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          James Finnern, M.D.,2 (\"Finnern\")  and his wife, Denise\n\nFinnern, were skiing down an  intermediate slope, Dream Maker, at\n\nSunday  River Ski  Resort3 (\"Sunday River\")  in Newry,  Maine, on\n\nMarch 1, 1989.  The Finnerns had previously skied the Dream Maker\n\nslope during the three  days preceding the accident and  had just\n\nfinished negotiating Dream  Maker immediately before  the fateful\n\nrun.   Finnern considered  his skiing ability  at the  time to be\n\nsomewhere between high-intermediate and low-expert levels.  \n\n          As Finnern descended the  slope, he allegedly saw three\n\nrelatively slow-moving or stopped skiers approximately 100 to 150\n\nfeet downslope,  who apparently  had entered  Dream Maker  from a\n\nconverging  beginners'  trail,  Ridge  Run.   Since,  as  Finnern\n\nclaims, he was not apprised of the convergence of Dream Maker and\n\nRidge Run  with a sign, and  was unaware of the  imminence of the\n\nconverging slope, he  was shocked and surprised by the appearance\n\n                       \n\n   2Federal jurisdiction is appropriate.  Finnern is a resident\n   of Colorado, and Sunday River is a corporation centered and\n   located in Maine, and the amount in controversy exceeds\n   $50,000.  Thus, diversity jurisdiction is satisfied.  28\n   U.S.C.   1332.\n\n   3Also referred to as Sunday River Skiway Corporation.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nof the Ridge Run skiers.  In order not to collide with or startle\n\nthe  slow-moving  skiers  below  him, Finnern  made  a  conscious\n\ndecision to  change course.   He successfully  avoided the  other\n\nskiers by at least thirty feet.  Finnern, however, while claiming\n\nto  be in  reasonable  control of  his  movements, came  upon  an\n\nordinary mogul that  sent him into the air.   The loss of control\n\noccasioned by  the mogul jump or landing resulted in his losing a\n\nski  and, unfortunately,  in his  crashing into  a tree  near the\n\nperiphery of the  slope.  He came to rest  after hitting the tree\n\nand  gliding a distance down the trail.  Finnern sustained severe\n\ninjuries.  \n\n          The tree at  issue is  located near the  tree line  and\n\nboundary of  the slope, but is  a few feet nearer  the trail than\n\nthe other peripheral trees.   Finnern alleges that the  proximity\n\nof the  tree to  the edge  of  the trail  proximately caused  his\n\naccident,  and represents  an issue  of negligent  maintenance or\n\noperation --  actionable under  state law.   Finnern also  claims\n\nthat the  lack of a warning sign was a substantial factor leading\n\nto  his  injuries.   Defendant further  argues  that there  was a\n\ndiagrammatic sign indicating an upcoming convergence.\n\n          Defendant ski  area operator contends that  the tree is\n\nnot  unusually positioned  and is  like many  other trees  on the\n\nslopes of Maine's many ski areas.  Defendant also claims that ski\n\nareas are exposed to  very limited liability under 26  M.R.S.A.  \n\n488 (1991), and that plaintiff legally assumed certain risks when\n\nhe decided to go skiing, one of which was collision with a tree.\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\n                               II.\n\n                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                          \n\n          The skiing accident led  to three separate decisions by\n\nthe federal district court.  Following the voluntary dismissal of\n\nthe two counts touching  on Mrs. Finnern's claims of  injury, the\n\ndistrict court,  on November  5, 1991,  dismissed  the two  tree-\n\nrelated  counts.   It  dismissed on  the  ground that  state  law\n\nexempted  ski  resorts  from  liability based  on  slope  design.\n\nHowever,  the  court denied  defendant's  motion  to dismiss  the\n\nwarning-sign  count because  it  raised  legitimate,  adjudicable\n\nissues, namely negligent operation  and maintenance of ski slopes\n\nunder 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991).  \n\n          The second facet of this appeal stems from the district\n\ncourt's February 14, 1992, denial of plaintiff's  motion to amend\n\nCount II with additional  factual expositions regarding negligent\n\ntree location.  Plaintiff  argues that the new  information would\n\nhave  prevented  the  court  from  dismissing  Count  II  of  the\n\ncomplaint.     The third district court decision on appeal is the\n\nApril 22,  1992, order  granting  defendant's motion  for summary\n\njudgment  on  the remaining  count pertaining  to  the lack  of a\n\nconvergence warning sign.   The court found no issue  of material\n\nfact in dispute and entered judgment for the ski resort.  \n\n          We  are  asked to  review  these  three district  court\n\norders but, before addressing each segment of the appeal in turn,\n\nwe  discuss the state law  limiting ski resort  liability and, in\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ngeneral  terms,  the  rationale  behind the  assumption  of  risk\n\ndoctrine underlying Maine's statute.\n\n                               III.\n\n                   INHERENT RISKS OF SKIING AND\n                                               \n                 DISMISSAL OF SLOPE DESIGN COUNTS\n                                                 \n\nA.  Risks of Alpine Skiing\n                          \n\n          Maine, like many  other states,  has given  legislative\n\nnotice  that downhill  snow skiing  involves significant  risk of\n\ninjury.4     Despite   acknowledged   risks,  many   people  find\n\nirresistible the danger inherent  in the sport of skiing,  one of\n\nthe many human challenges to nature's wrath.  \n\n          Because skiing is dangerous, and since people enjoy and\n\nengage in  the sport in spite  of the danger,  the legislature of\n\nthe state of Maine, like many  others, decided to enact a statute\n\nto  limit  ski  area  operators'  liability  and  to  define  the\n\nassumption   of  risk,  general   responsibilities,  duties,  and\n\nliabilities of skiers and ski resorts generally:\n\n          It  is  hereby  recognized that  skiing  as a\n          recreational sport  and the use  of passenger\n          tramways   associated    therewith   may   be\n          hazardous to skiers or passengers, regardless\n\n                       \n\n   4See 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991) (Maine's law regarding skier\n       \n   assumption of risk and ski resort liability limitations). \n   Many states have enacted laws limiting liability of ski area\n   operators, and defining the duties of operators and skiers. \n   See, e.g., Alaska Stat.   09.17.060,   09.65.135 (1992)\n            \n   (relative liability of ski resorts and skiers); Colo. Rev.\n   Stat.   109 (1992) (duties of skiers and penalties); Colo.\n   Rev. Stat.   112-13 (1992) (limitations on ski area operator\n   liability for inherent dangers of skiing); Conn. Gen. Stat.\n     29-212 (1990) (skiers' assumption of risk); Idaho Code  \n   6-1107 (1992) (limitations of liability of ski area\n   operators); Idaho Code   6-1109 (1992) (liability of\n   skiers).\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          of all feasible safety  measures which can be\n          taken.  Therefore, each skier shall have  the\n          sole responsibility for knowing the  range of\n          his own ability to negotiate any slope or ski\n          trail, and it shall be the duty of each skier\n          to conduct himself within  the limits of  his\n          own ability, to maintain control of his speed\n          and course at all times while skiing, to heed\n          all  posted  warnings,  and  to  refrain from\n          acting  in  a  manner   which  may  cause  or\n          contribute  to  the   injury  of  himself  or\n          others.    Except  as otherwise  specifically\n          provided in this  subchapter, each skier  who\n                                                  \n          participates in the sport of skiing  shall be\n          deemed  to  have  assumed  the  risk  of  the\n                                                       \n          dangers inherent in the sport and assumed the\n                          \n          legal  responsibility for  any injury  to his\n          person   or  property  arising   out  of  his\n          participation  in the sport of skiing, unless\n                                                       \n          the injury  or death  was actually caused  by\n                                                       \n          the negligent operation or maintenance of the\n                                                       \n          ski area by the ski area operator, its agents\n                                           \n          or  employees.   Except  as provided  in this\n          section, the responsibility for collisions by\n          any  skier  while actually  skiing,  with any\n          person or object, shall be solely that of the\n          skier or skiers involved in collision and not\n          that of the ski  area operator.  This section\n          shall  not  prevent  the  maintenance  of  an\n          action against  a ski area  operator for  the\n          negligent design,  construction, operation or\n          maintenance of a tramway.  \n\nSkiers' and Tramway Passengers'  Responsibilities, 26 M.R.S.A.   \n\n488  (1991)  (emphasis  added).    An  understanding  of  Maine's\n\nstatutory effort to limit  ski area operator liability in  skiing\n\naccidents is essential in our review of the district court orders\n\non appeal.\n\nB.

If a trial  court accepts  plaintiff's\n\nfacts  and can envision no reasonable application of the law that\n\nwould entitle plaintiff to relief,  the court may rightly dismiss\n\nthe  case.  In  our review of  the district court's  dismissal of\n\nCounts II and III, we must determine whether the facts supportive\n\nto plaintiff, the applicable law,  and the interpretation of  the\n\nlaw justly support dismissal.\n\n          In the case  at hand, defendant  Sunday River moved  in\n\nthe district  court  to dismiss  all  three remaining  counts  of\n\nFinnern's complaint for failure to  state a claim.  Specifically,\n\nSunday River argued that Counts II and III of the complaint state\n\ncauses  of  action  for  slope  design  negligence  and  not  for\n\nmaintenance  or operation  negligence, a  statutorily significant\n\ndistinction.  See 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991). \n                 \n\n          Section  488,  Maine's  statute  entitled  Skiers'  and\n\nTramway Passengers' Responsibilities, greatly limits liability of\n\nski area operators,  excepting only liability  of ski resorts  if\n                                   \n\n\"the injury  or  death  [is]  actually  caused  by  []  negligent\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\noperation  or maintenance  . .  . .\"   26  M.R.S.A.    488 (1991)\n                         \n\n(emphasis  added).    The  law   not  only  limits  ski  resorts'\n\nliability,  but the statute also emphasizes  that skiers assume a\n\nsignificant amount of  risk in engaging  in the inherently  risky\n\nsport  of skiing.5  Section 488 clearly states that skiers should\n\nknow  their abilities  and the  ever-present dangers  inherent to\n\nskiing.  Id. \n            \n\n          The  law is clear that  a Maine ski  area operator like\n\nSunday  River  may only  be held  legally  liable if  its alleged\n\nactions or inactions involved negligent operation or maintenance.\n\nThe  district  court  interpreted  this  statutory  provision  to\n\n\"preclude[] any  action for negligent  design of  the slopes  and\n\ntrails of  a ski area.\"   Finnern v. Sunday River,  Civil No. 91-\n                                                 \n\n0065-P-H,  slip op.  at  3  (D.  Me.  Nov.  28,  1991)  (citation\n\nomitted).  We  agree as a matter of law  that design questions do\n\nnot fall within the statutory operation-or-maintenance exception.\n\nOur review of  the district  court's dismissal of  Counts II  and\n\nIII, therefore,  must focus on whether  the facts as  seen in the\n\nlight  most  favorable  to  plaintiff  support  an  operation-or-\n\nmaintenance exception  to Maine's bar  on liability for  ski area\n\n                       \n\n   5Assumption of risk is one of the legal terms of art that is\n   relatively self-explanatory.  Relevant to this case, Prosser\n   and Keeton note the following on assuming risks:  \"[T]hose\n   who participate or sit as spectators at sports and\n   amusements may be taken to assume the known risks of being\n   hurt by roller coasters, flying baseballs, hockey pucks,\n   golf balls, wrestlers, or such things as fireworks\n   explosions.  Cardozo once summarized all this quite neatly: \n   'The timorous may stay at home.'\"  W.

In fact,\n\nthe  trial court accepted  the facts  as delineated  by Finnern's\n\ncomplaint,  such as the location  of the tree,  the confluence of\n\nthe two slopes,  and Finnern's controlled  skiing.  The  district\n\ncourt,  however, found  unnecessary a  lengthy discussion  of the\n\nfacts  because  as a  matter  of law,  the  court held  that even\n\naccepting plaintiff's  factual allegations in Counts  II and III,\n\n\"[a]llowing  the  tree  in  question to  be  present  within  the\n\ntraveled  portion of the Dream Maker trail was obviously a design\n\ndecision  rather than  an  aspect of  operation or  maintenance.\"\n\nFinnern v. Sunday River, Civil No. 91-0065-P-H, slip op. at 3 (D.\n                       \n\nMe. Nov. 5, 1991).   \n\n          We agree as a matter of law that the tree's position as\n\ndescribed by plaintiff's facts,  along with the slope's allegedly\n\ndefective form and angle,  are actually averments implicating ski\n\narea design,  and not  operation  or maintenance.6   Examples  of\n\n                       \n\n   6We note this case appears to be unlike a recent decision\n   from the same district in which the court denied a motion to\n   dismiss in a context of a set of facts similar to the ones\n   in this case.  See S nchez v. Sunday River Skiway Corp.,\n                                                          \n   1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15616, (D. Me. Sept. 28, 1992).  We\n   compare the two cases without passing any judgment on\n   S nchez; we have only seen the district court opinion and\n          \n   not a page of the trial record.  \n        In S nchez, the ski resort left a tree stump intact\n                  \n   thirty feet into the skiing area of a slope.  On the motion\n   for dismissal, the district court determined that the relief\n   asked for could conceivably be granted.  The motion for\n   dismissal was denied since a legitimate argument could be\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nnegligent operation  or maintenance would include  placing a snow\n\nblower  or  other machine  in a  precarious  position on  a slope\n\nwithout proper  warning,  or  failing  to notify  skiers  that  a\n\nparticular slope had been  closed due to poor or  dangerous trail\n\nconditions.   But tree  placement along the  periphery of slopes,\n\ntrail direction, curvature, and degree of inclination, as well as\n\nmyriad other ordinary properties  of ski areas, are presumptively\n\ndesign issues.  If tree placement or location along the periphery\n\nof  trails  were  actionable,   ski  area  operators  and  skiers\n\nthemselves  might  find  themselves  out  in  the  cold.    As  a\n\nCalifornia appeals court observed in a tree collision case: \n\n          The  tree   itself  provided  a   warning  to\n          plaintiff   of  the  implicit   danger  of  a\n          collision  with  it.   A  fortiori, [the  ski\n          resort] was under no duty  to remove it.  One\n          could  ask, if  there were  a duty  to remove\n          trees along  the  edges of  ski runs,  \"which\n          trees?\"  Such a  solution, if followed to its\n          logical conclusion  . . .  would finally lead\n          to cutting down every tree on the mountain.\n\nDanieley  v.  Goldmine Ski  Assocs., 218  Cal.  App. 3d  111, 122\n                                   \n\n(1990).   Finding the  location of the  tree in question  and the\n\nlayout of the  surrounding slope to be design issues  as a matter\n\nof law, we need not reach an assessment of defendant's negligence\n\nin implementing  those decisions.   Sunday River  cannot be  held\n\nliable for such decisions or actions under Maine law.\n\n                       \n\n   made, according to the district court, that maintenance and\n   operation decisions should have caused the stump's removal\n   or marking.  In this case, however, maintenance purposes\n                                                           \n   have not caused a partial removal of the tree, as may have\n   been the case with the stump scenario in S nchez.\n                                                   \n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\n          We affirm  the district court's dismissal  of Counts II\n\nand III for failure to  state a claim upon which relief  could be\n\ngranted pursuant to Maine law.  26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991).7  \n\nC.

Finnern  contends  that the  information may  have\n\npersuaded the  district court that  as a matter  of law  the tree\n\nplacement issue  could reasonably be interpreted  as an operation\n\nor  maintenance problem and therefore was better left for a trial\n\non  the  merits  rather  than a  court-ordered  dismissal.8    In\n\ndenying  plaintiff's  motion   to  amend,   the  district   court\n\nsuccinctly stated that the  \"amendments, even if permitted, would\n\nnot  change the [c]ourt's decision to dismiss Count II.\"  Finnern\n                                                                 \n\nv.

In other words,\n\nmore design information  about the placement  or location of  the\n           \n\ntree or  the  form of  the  slope would  still  fail to  state  a\n\ncolorable claim under section 488 of  the Maine law.  As we noted\n\n                       \n\n   8Finnern attempted to cure his complaint by alleging that\n   the tree at issue was marked with a blue stripe indicating\n   it was a \"land boundary\" tree.  Finnern suggested that part\n   of the ski resort's land was leased and the other part owned\n   by the resort.  If the tree with which Finnern collided had\n   been deliberately left on the slope for the purpose of\n   providing a boundary marker between two distinct tracts of\n   land, Finnern argues the tree's placement was an operations\n   or maintenance concern and not a design matter.\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\nin Correa-Mart nez,  903 F.2d at 59, \"[w]here  an amendment would\n                  \n\nbe  futile or  would serve  no legitimate  purpose, the  district\n\ncourt should  not needlessly  prolong matters.\"   After examining\n\nthe record and relevant law in the case at hand,  we find nothing\n\napproaching  an abuse of discretion  on the part  of the district\n\ncourt in  denying the motion to  amend.

Sept. 30, 1992).  \n\n            We, like the district court, find no material fact in\n\ndispute in regard  to Count I.  In brief,  Finnern claims to have\n\nbeen  in control of his  skiing on the  Dream Maker run.   He had\n\nsufficient time to consider in a rational manner his options upon\n\nseeing slow-moving skiers  below him.9  In fact,  he had at least\n\n100 to 150 feet advance notice of the positions of  the Ridge Run\n\nskiers.  He made a  considered judgment to ski around them  so as\n\nnot  to startle them.  Finnern not only succeeded in avoiding the\n\nother skiers, but he also did so by at least thirty feet.  \n\n          As  Maine law dictates,  other skiers on  the slopes of\n\nthe state's ski areas are an inherent risk assumed by skiers.  26\n\nM.R.S.A.   488 (1991).  With  the facts that we consider material\n\nto a  decision on the warning-sign charge of Count I -- even with\n\nthe facts as presented by Finnern  -- we agree with the  district\n\ncourt's  grant of summary judgment  for Sunday River.   A warning\n\nsign would have afforded Finnern no significant additional notice\n\nof the presence of the Ridge  Run skiers, and Sunday River had no\n\n                       \n\n   9The exact position of the Ridge Run skiers is a fact in\n   dispute; however, it is immaterial to our decision here.\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nduty  to warn Finnern  of each and  every inherent danger  on the\n\nslopes.  \n\n          The  appearance  of the  other  skiers  on Dream  Maker\n\nshould  not have come as a surprise  to Finnern.  Ski resorts are\n\nprecisely social,  recreational areas with  many downhill skiers.\n\nMaine's liability-limiting  statute  reflects  this  fact.    We,\n\ntherefore, cannot envision a  judge or jury who  could reasonably\n\nfind that Finnern's accident was a result of, or partially caused\n\nby, the lack of  a convergence sign on Dream Maker.

Plaintiff,  an  injured skier,\n                               \n\nargues  that a ski area operator negligently maintained a tree in\n\na particular  area of a Maine  ski slope and that  the ski resort\n\nnegligently  failed to post a warning sign alerting skiers to the\n\npresence  of a converging  trail.   Plaintiff alleges  that these\n\nnegligent acts proximately caused  him to suffer serious injuries\n\nin a skiing accident.  \n\n          Plaintiff  originally  brought a  five-count negligence\n\naction against  the ski resort seeking damages.   Two of the five\n\ncounts,  loss of  consortium  and emotional  distress brought  on\n\nbehalf of plaintiff's spouse,  were voluntarily dismissed.  Based\n\non  considerations of  state law,1  the district  court dismissed\n\ntwo more counts alleging negligent tree location or placement and\n\nslope  arrangement for failure to  state a claim  on which relief\n\ncould be granted.   Also, the court denied plaintiff's  motion to\n\namend  the  tree placement  count in  order to  allege additional\n\nfacts.   Finally, the district court found the warning-sign count\n\nadjudicable; however,  finding no  material fact was  in dispute,\n\n                       \n\n   1The Maine legislature enacted the Skiers' and Tramway\n   Passengers' Responsibilities Act, 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991),\n   to limit the liability of Maine's ski area operators.  The\n   statute provides that skiers assume risks while skiing on\n   the state's slopes and immunizes ski resorts from legal\n   responsibility for skiing injuries \"unless the injury or\n   death [is] actually caused by the negligent operation or\n                                                        \n   maintenance of the ski area by the ski area operator, its\n              \n   agents or employees.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Although the\n                            \n   statute itself does not define \"operation or maintenance,\"\n   the district court found issues of negligent slope design to\n                                                            \n   be outside the scope of the statute's liability limitation\n   exception.

Plaintiff  appeals   the  district   court's\n\ndismissals,  denial  of motion  to  amend,  and summary  judgment\n\ndecision.  For  reasons explained below,  we affirm the  district\n                                             affirm\n\ncourt in all relevant respects.\n\n                                I.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          James Finnern, M.D.,2 (\"Finnern\")  and his wife, Denise\n\nFinnern, were skiing down an  intermediate slope, Dream Maker, at\n\nSunday  River Ski  Resort3 (\"Sunday River\")  in Newry,  Maine, on\n\nMarch 1, 1989.  The Finnerns had previously skied the Dream Maker\n\nslope during the three  days preceding the accident and  had just\n\nfinished negotiating Dream  Maker immediately before  the fateful\n\nrun.   Finnern considered  his skiing ability  at the  time to be\n\nsomewhere between high-intermediate and low-expert levels.  \n\n          As Finnern descended the  slope, he allegedly saw three\n\nrelatively slow-moving or stopped skiers approximately 100 to 150\n\nfeet downslope,  who apparently  had entered  Dream Maker  from a\n\nconverging  beginners'  trail,  Ridge  Run.   Since,  as  Finnern\n\nclaims, he was not apprised of the convergence of Dream Maker and\n\nRidge Run  with a sign, and  was unaware of the  imminence of the\n\nconverging slope, he  was shocked and surprised by the appearance\n\n                       \n\n   2Federal jurisdiction is appropriate.  Finnern is a resident\n   of Colorado, and Sunday River is a corporation centered and\n   located in Maine, and the amount in controversy exceeds\n   $50,000.  Thus, diversity jurisdiction is satisfied.  28\n   U.S.C.   1332.\n\n   3Also referred to as Sunday River Skiway Corporation.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nof the Ridge Run skiers.  In order not to collide with or startle\n\nthe  slow-moving  skiers  below  him, Finnern  made  a  conscious\n\ndecision to  change course.   He successfully  avoided the  other\n\nskiers by at least thirty feet.  Finnern, however, while claiming\n\nto  be in  reasonable  control of  his  movements, came  upon  an\n\nordinary mogul that  sent him into the air.   The loss of control\n\noccasioned by  the mogul jump or landing resulted in his losing a\n\nski  and, unfortunately,  in his  crashing into  a tree  near the\n\nperiphery of the  slope.  He came to rest  after hitting the tree\n\nand  gliding a distance down the trail.  Finnern sustained severe\n\ninjuries.  \n\n          The tree at  issue is  located near the  tree line  and\n\nboundary of  the slope, but is  a few feet nearer  the trail than\n\nthe other peripheral trees.   Finnern alleges that the  proximity\n\nof the  tree to  the edge  of  the trail  proximately caused  his\n\naccident,  and represents  an issue  of negligent  maintenance or\n\noperation --  actionable under  state law.   Finnern also  claims\n\nthat the  lack of a warning sign was a substantial factor leading\n\nto  his  injuries.   Defendant further  argues  that there  was a\n\ndiagrammatic sign indicating an upcoming convergence.\n\n          Defendant ski  area operator contends that  the tree is\n\nnot  unusually positioned  and is  like many  other trees  on the\n\nslopes of Maine's many ski areas.  Defendant also claims that ski\n\nareas are exposed to  very limited liability under 26  M.R.S.A.  \n\n488 (1991), and that plaintiff legally assumed certain risks when\n\nhe decided to go skiing, one of which was collision with a tree.\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\n                               II.\n\n                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                          \n\n          The skiing accident led  to three separate decisions by\n\nthe federal district court.  Following the voluntary dismissal of\n\nthe two counts touching  on Mrs. Finnern's claims of  injury, the\n\ndistrict court,  on November  5, 1991,  dismissed  the two  tree-\n\nrelated  counts.   It  dismissed on  the  ground that  state  law\n\nexempted  ski  resorts  from  liability based  on  slope  design.\n\nHowever,  the  court denied  defendant's  motion  to dismiss  the\n\nwarning-sign  count because  it  raised  legitimate,  adjudicable\n\nissues, namely negligent operation  and maintenance of ski slopes\n\nunder 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991).  \n\n          The second facet of this appeal stems from the district\n\ncourt's February 14, 1992, denial of plaintiff's  motion to amend\n\nCount II with additional  factual expositions regarding negligent\n\ntree location.  Plaintiff  argues that the new  information would\n\nhave  prevented  the  court  from  dismissing  Count  II  of  the\n\ncomplaint.     The third district court decision on appeal is the\n\nApril 22,  1992, order  granting  defendant's motion  for summary\n\njudgment  on  the remaining  count pertaining  to  the lack  of a\n\nconvergence warning sign.   The court found no issue  of material\n\nfact in dispute and entered judgment for the ski resort.  \n\n          We  are  asked to  review  these  three district  court\n\norders but, before addressing each segment of the appeal in turn,\n\nwe  discuss the state law  limiting ski resort  liability and, in\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ngeneral  terms,  the  rationale  behind the  assumption  of  risk\n\ndoctrine underlying Maine's statute.\n\n                               III.\n\n                   INHERENT RISKS OF SKIING AND\n                                               \n                 DISMISSAL OF SLOPE DESIGN COUNTS\n                                                 \n\nA.  Risks of Alpine Skiing\n                          \n\n          Maine, like many  other states,  has given  legislative\n\nnotice  that downhill  snow skiing  involves significant  risk of\n\ninjury.4     Despite   acknowledged   risks,  many   people  find\n\nirresistible the danger inherent  in the sport of skiing,  one of\n\nthe many human challenges to nature's wrath.  \n\n          Because skiing is dangerous, and since people enjoy and\n\nengage in  the sport in spite  of the danger,  the legislature of\n\nthe state of Maine, like many  others, decided to enact a statute\n\nto  limit  ski  area  operators'  liability  and  to  define  the\n\nassumption   of  risk,  general   responsibilities,  duties,  and\n\nliabilities of skiers and ski resorts generally:\n\n          It  is  hereby  recognized that  skiing  as a\n          recreational sport  and the use  of passenger\n          tramways   associated    therewith   may   be\n          hazardous to skiers or passengers, regardless\n\n                       \n\n   4See 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991) (Maine's law regarding skier\n       \n   assumption of risk and ski resort liability limitations). \n   Many states have enacted laws limiting liability of ski area\n   operators, and defining the duties of operators and skiers. \n   See, e.g., Alaska Stat.   09.17.060,   09.65.135 (1992)\n            \n   (relative liability of ski resorts and skiers); Colo. Rev.\n   Stat.   109 (1992) (duties of skiers and penalties); Colo.\n   Rev. Stat.   112-13 (1992) (limitations on ski area operator\n   liability for inherent dangers of skiing); Conn. Gen. Stat.\n     29-212 (1990) (skiers' assumption of risk); Idaho Code  \n   6-1107 (1992) (limitations of liability of ski area\n   operators); Idaho Code   6-1109 (1992) (liability of\n   skiers).\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          of all feasible safety  measures which can be\n          taken.  Therefore, each skier shall have  the\n          sole responsibility for knowing the  range of\n          his own ability to negotiate any slope or ski\n          trail, and it shall be the duty of each skier\n          to conduct himself within  the limits of  his\n          own ability, to maintain control of his speed\n          and course at all times while skiing, to heed\n          all  posted  warnings,  and  to  refrain from\n          acting  in  a  manner   which  may  cause  or\n          contribute  to  the   injury  of  himself  or\n          others.    Except  as otherwise  specifically\n          provided in this  subchapter, each skier  who\n                                                  \n          participates in the sport of skiing  shall be\n          deemed  to  have  assumed  the  risk  of  the\n                                                       \n          dangers inherent in the sport and assumed the\n                          \n          legal  responsibility for  any injury  to his\n          person   or  property  arising   out  of  his\n          participation  in the sport of skiing, unless\n                                                       \n          the injury  or death  was actually caused  by\n                                                       \n          the negligent operation or maintenance of the\n                                                       \n          ski area by the ski area operator, its agents\n                                           \n          or  employees.   Except  as provided  in this\n          section, the responsibility for collisions by\n          any  skier  while actually  skiing,  with any\n          person or object, shall be solely that of the\n          skier or skiers involved in collision and not\n          that of the ski  area operator.

If a trial  court accepts  plaintiff's\n\nfacts  and can envision no reasonable application of the law that\n\nwould entitle plaintiff to relief,  the court may rightly dismiss\n\nthe  case.  In  our review of  the district court's  dismissal of\n\nCounts II and III, we must determine whether the facts supportive\n\nto plaintiff, the applicable law,  and the interpretation of  the\n\nlaw justly support dismissal.\n\n          In the case  at hand, defendant  Sunday River moved  in\n\nthe district  court  to dismiss  all  three remaining  counts  of\n\nFinnern's complaint for failure to  state a claim.  Specifically,\n\nSunday River argued that Counts II and III of the complaint state\n\ncauses  of  action  for  slope  design  negligence  and  not  for\n\nmaintenance  or operation  negligence, a  statutorily significant\n\ndistinction.  See 26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991). \n                 \n\n          Section  488,  Maine's  statute  entitled  Skiers'  and\n\nTramway Passengers' Responsibilities, greatly limits liability of\n\nski area operators,  excepting only liability  of ski resorts  if\n                                   \n\n\"the injury  or  death  [is]  actually  caused  by  []  negligent\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\noperation  or maintenance  . .  . .\"   26  M.R.S.A.    488 (1991)\n                         \n\n(emphasis  added).    The  law   not  only  limits  ski  resorts'\n\nliability,  but the statute also emphasizes  that skiers assume a\n\nsignificant amount of  risk in engaging  in the inherently  risky\n\nsport  of skiing.5  Section 488 clearly states that skiers should\n\nknow  their abilities  and the  ever-present dangers  inherent to\n\nskiing.  Id. \n            \n\n          The  law is clear that  a Maine ski  area operator like\n\nSunday  River  may only  be held  legally  liable if  its alleged\n\nactions or inactions involved negligent operation or maintenance.\n\nThe  district  court  interpreted  this  statutory  provision  to\n\n\"preclude[] any  action for negligent  design of  the slopes  and\n\ntrails of  a ski area.\"   Finnern v. Sunday River,  Civil No. 91-\n                                                 \n\n0065-P-H,  slip op.  at  3  (D.  Me.  Nov.  28,  1991)  (citation\n\nomitted).  We  agree as a matter of law  that design questions do\n\nnot fall within the statutory operation-or-maintenance exception.\n\nOur review of  the district  court's dismissal of  Counts II  and\n\nIII, therefore,  must focus on whether  the facts as  seen in the\n\nlight  most  favorable  to  plaintiff  support  an  operation-or-\n\nmaintenance exception  to Maine's bar  on liability for  ski area\n\n                       \n\n   5Assumption of risk is one of the legal terms of art that is\n   relatively self-explanatory.  Relevant to this case, Prosser\n   and Keeton note the following on assuming risks:  \"[T]hose\n   who participate or sit as spectators at sports and\n   amusements may be taken to assume the known risks of being\n   hurt by roller coasters, flying baseballs, hockey pucks,\n   golf balls, wrestlers, or such things as fireworks\n   explosions.  Cardozo once summarized all this quite neatly: \n   'The timorous may stay at home.'\"  W. Page Keeton et al.,\n   Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts   68, at 485-86 (5th\n                                         \n   ed. 1984) (citations omitted).\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\noperators, or whether  the facts as  viewed through a  plaintiff-\n\nfriendly lens allege a nonactionable design fault.\n\n          In  regard to Counts II and III, the district court did\n\nidentify the facts most favorable to plaintiff Finnern.  In fact,\n\nthe  trial court accepted  the facts  as delineated  by Finnern's\n\ncomplaint,  such as the location  of the tree,  the confluence of\n\nthe two slopes,  and Finnern's controlled  skiing.  The  district\n\ncourt,  however, found  unnecessary a  lengthy discussion  of the\n\nfacts  because  as a  matter  of law,  the  court held  that even\n\naccepting plaintiff's  factual allegations in Counts  II and III,\n\n\"[a]llowing  the  tree  in  question to  be  present  within  the\n\ntraveled  portion of the Dream Maker trail was obviously a design\n\ndecision  rather than  an  aspect of  operation or  maintenance.\"\n\nFinnern v. Sunday River, Civil No. 91-0065-P-H, slip op. at 3 (D.\n                       \n\nMe. Nov. 5, 1991).   \n\n          We agree as a matter of law that the tree's position as\n\ndescribed by plaintiff's facts,  along with the slope's allegedly\n\ndefective form and angle,  are actually averments implicating ski\n\narea design,  and not  operation  or maintenance.6   Examples  of\n\n                       \n\n   6We note this case appears to be unlike a recent decision\n   from the same district in which the court denied a motion to\n   dismiss in a context of a set of facts similar to the ones\n   in this case.  See S nchez v. Sunday River Skiway Corp.,\n                                                          \n   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">15616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (D. Me. Sept. 28, 1992).  We\n   compare the two cases without passing any judgment on\n   S nchez; we have only seen the district court opinion and\n          \n   not a page of the trial record.  \n        In S nchez, the ski resort left a tree stump intact\n                  \n   thirty feet into the skiing area of a slope.  On the motion\n   for dismissal, the district court determined that the relief\n   asked for could conceivably be granted.  The motion for\n   dismissal was denied since a legitimate argument could be\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nnegligent operation  or maintenance would include  placing a snow\n\nblower  or  other machine  in a  precarious  position on  a slope\n\nwithout proper  warning,  or  failing  to notify  skiers  that  a\n\nparticular slope had been  closed due to poor or  dangerous trail\n\nconditions.   But tree  placement along the  periphery of slopes,\n\ntrail direction, curvature, and degree of inclination, as well as\n\nmyriad other ordinary properties  of ski areas, are presumptively\n\ndesign issues.  If tree placement or location along the periphery\n\nof  trails  were  actionable,   ski  area  operators  and  skiers\n\nthemselves  might  find  themselves  out  in  the  cold.    As  a\n\nCalifornia appeals court observed in a tree collision case: \n\n          The  tree   itself  provided  a   warning  to\n          plaintiff   of  the  implicit   danger  of  a\n          collision  with  it.   A  fortiori, [the  ski\n          resort] was under no duty  to remove it.  One\n          could  ask, if  there were  a duty  to remove\n          trees along  the  edges of  ski runs,  \"which\n          trees?\"  Such a  solution, if followed to its\n          logical conclusion  . . .  would finally lead\n          to cutting down every tree on the mountain.\n\nDanieley  v.  Goldmine Ski  Assocs., 218  Cal.  App. 3d  111, 122\n                                   \n\n(1990).   Finding the  location of the  tree in question  and the\n\nlayout of the  surrounding slope to be design issues  as a matter\n\nof law, we need not reach an assessment of defendant's negligence\n\nin implementing  those decisions.   Sunday River  cannot be  held\n\nliable for such decisions or actions under Maine law.\n\n                       \n\n   made, according to the district court, that maintenance and\n   operation decisions should have caused the stump's removal\n   or marking.  In this case, however, maintenance purposes\n                                                           \n   have not caused a partial removal of the tree, as may have\n   been the case with the stump scenario in S nchez.\n                                                   \n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\n          We affirm  the district court's dismissal  of Counts II\n\nand III for failure to  state a claim upon which relief  could be\n\ngranted pursuant to Maine law.  26 M.R.S.A.   488 (1991).7  \n\nC.

Finnern  contends  that the  information may  have\n\npersuaded the  district court that  as a matter  of law  the tree\n\nplacement issue  could reasonably be interpreted  as an operation\n\nor  maintenance problem and therefore was better left for a trial\n\non  the  merits  rather  than a  court-ordered  dismissal.8    In\n\ndenying  plaintiff's  motion   to  amend,   the  district   court\n\nsuccinctly stated that the  \"amendments, even if permitted, would\n\nnot  change the [c]ourt's decision to dismiss Count II.\"  Finnern\n                                                                 \n\nv.

In other words,\n\nmore design information  about the placement  or location of  the\n           \n\ntree or  the  form of  the  slope would  still  fail to  state  a\n\ncolorable claim under section 488 of  the Maine law.  As we noted\n\n                       \n\n   8Finnern attempted to cure his complaint by alleging that\n   the tree at issue was marked with a blue stripe indicating\n   it was a \"land boundary\" tree.  Finnern suggested that part\n   of the ski resort's land was leased and the other part owned\n   by the resort.  If the tree with which Finnern collided had\n   been deliberately left on the slope for the purpose of\n   providing a boundary marker between two distinct tracts of\n   land, Finnern argues the tree's placement was an operations\n   or maintenance concern and not a design matter.\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\nin Correa-Mart nez,  903 F.2d at 59, \"[w]here  an amendment would\n                  \n\nbe  futile or  would serve  no legitimate  purpose, the  district\n\ncourt should  not needlessly  prolong matters.\"   After examining\n\nthe record and relevant law in the case at hand,  we find nothing\n\napproaching  an abuse of discretion  on the part  of the district\n\ncourt in  denying the motion to  amend.

Osco Drug, Inc., 1992 U.S. App.\n                                                 \n\nLEXIS 24370, at *1-2 (1st Cir. Sept. 30, 1992).  \n\n            We, like the district court, find no material fact in\n\ndispute in regard  to Count I.  In brief,  Finnern claims to have\n\nbeen  in control of his  skiing on the  Dream Maker run.   He had\n\nsufficient time to consider in a rational manner his options upon\n\nseeing slow-moving skiers  below him.9  In fact,  he had at least\n\n100 to 150 feet advance notice of the positions of  the Ridge Run\n\nskiers.  He made a  considered judgment to ski around them  so as\n\nnot  to startle them.  Finnern not only succeeded in avoiding the\n\nother skiers, but he also did so by at least thirty feet.  \n\n          As  Maine law dictates,  other skiers on  the slopes of\n\nthe state's ski areas are an inherent risk assumed by skiers.  26\n\nM.R.S.A.   488 (1991).  With  the facts that we consider material\n\nto a  decision on the warning-sign charge of Count I -- even with\n\nthe facts as presented by Finnern  -- we agree with the  district\n\ncourt's  grant of summary judgment  for Sunday River.   A warning\n\nsign would have afforded Finnern no significant additional notice\n\nof the presence of the Ridge  Run skiers, and Sunday River had no\n\n                       \n\n   9The exact position of the Ridge Run skiers is a fact in\n   dispute; however, it is immaterial to our decision here.\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nduty  to warn Finnern  of each and  every inherent danger  on the\n\nslopes.  \n\n          The  appearance  of the  other  skiers  on Dream  Maker\n\nshould  not have come as a surprise  to Finnern.  Ski resorts are\n\nprecisely social,  recreational areas with  many downhill skiers.\n\nMaine's liability-limiting  statute  reflects  this  fact.    We,\n\ntherefore, cannot envision a  judge or jury who  could reasonably\n\nfind that Finnern's accident was a result of, or partially caused\n\nby, the lack of  a convergence sign on Dream Maker.   While it is\n\nunfortunate that Finnern's  choice of path  around the Ridge  Run\n\nskiers  led  him to  collide  with a  tree, Sunday  River  is not\n\nlegally  responsible.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment in\n                          affirm\n\nfavor of defendant.\n\n                                V.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          We agree with the district court  that no material fact\n\nis in dispute with  respect to Count I, the  warning-sign charge.\n\nIn  addition, we  believe  the district  court correctly  granted\n\ndefendant's summary judgment  motion as  to Count I  in favor  of\n\ndefendant Sunday River.  \n\n          We also  find no actionable, negligent  behavior on the\n\npart of the ski  resort in its operation or maintenance  of Dream\n\nMaker.   Plaintiff Finnern did  not meet his  statutory burden of\n\ndemonstrating  that  an  action  for   maintenance  or  operation\n                                                                 \n\nnegligence  existed as required by  relevant law in  the state of\n\nMaine.    With  or  without  the  amendments  to  the  complaint,\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\nplaintiff  makes a  slope design  argument in  Counts II  and III\n                                \n\naccording to section 488 and reasonable judicial inferences.  Ski\n\narea operators in Maine are  simply not liable for the design  of\n\ntheir slopes under state law.  We, therefore, affirm the district\n                                              affirm\n                                                    \n\ncourt's decisions.\n\n          So Ordered.\n                    \n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n</pre>",
