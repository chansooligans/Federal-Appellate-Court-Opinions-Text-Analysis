We  add that although  the district\n\ncourt did not specifically address the pendent state claim in\n\nits   order,   the   court's   blanket   dismissal  seemingly\n\nencompasses all claims in the second amended complaint.   The\n\ndistrict  court appropriately  dismissed  the  pendent  claim\n\nwithout  reaching the merits.
