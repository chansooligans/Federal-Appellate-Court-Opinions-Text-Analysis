On February 15, 1991, a paid informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arranged to purchase from Rodrigo Sostre, one of appellant's co-defendants, a kilogram of cocaine for $28,000.  During one of their telephone conversations (which was recorded), Sostre told the informant that his \"source\" for the cocaine was about to arrive at his (Sostre's) apartment.  A few minutes later, appellant drove up to the apartment building, went inside and came back out with Sostre.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">On February 19, 1991, the final arrangements for the drug transaction took place.  During another recorded phone call, Sostre told the informant that he was on his way to meet his source to discuss where the deal would occur.  Shortly thereafter, Sostre was seen entering appellant's apartment building.  Sostre then instructed the informant that the sale would take place at Sostre's apartment.  After further negotiations at which the informant and his \"business partner,\" Anthony Roberto, an undercover DEA agent, were present, it was agreed that Sostre would activate the informant's beeper when the cocaine arrived.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch'; they then went to Sostre's apartment.  A few minutes after their arrival, the informant's beeper sounded.  When the informant and Roberto arrived at Sostre's apartment, Sanchez, Hernandez and appellant were already inside.  When questioned by Roberto why three people were necessary, Sostre replied that that was the way he did business.  The arrest ensued.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Appellant testified at trial.  He claimed that when Sostre visited him on the 19th, they arranged to meet later in the day.  He denied having gotten into the car with Hernandez and Sanchez.  Rather, he stated, he had walked to Sostre's apartment and had arrived at the same time as his co-defendants, whom he did not know.  He averred that he was there, as arranged, to have a beer with Sostre.  He therefore sat apart from the others while the drug transaction occurred.  He testified that he was unaware of the sale of cocaine, that he could not hear the conversation between his co-defendants, the informant and Roberto, and that he could not see the contents of the bag that contained the cocaine.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">II</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">To establish a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show that \"the alleged deficiencies in professional performance assumed unconstitutional dimensions . . . .\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Barrett</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, 965 F.2d 1184, 1193 (1st Cir. 1992).

We are not reviewing the prosecutor's comment to see whether it constituted plain error.  Rather, we are deciding whether appellant's counsel provided ineffective assistance to appellant by </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">failing to object</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> to the comment.  This issue turns on whether counsel's conduct \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Murchu</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, 926 F.2d at 58.

The decision whether to object during a closing argument is plainly a tactical choice.  For instance, counsel may not have wanted to risk drawing attention to the conflicting stories.  Further, when credibility is placed in issue by a defendant's choice to take the stand and present his side of the story, as here, the law in our circuit permits a prosecutor to comment on the motivation of the defendant.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Smith</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, 982 F.2d at 683.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Given the range and type of prosecutorial argument we have allowed in such a situation, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">see</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">e.g.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> (comment that witness and defendant had \"concocted\" their story proper as it suggested inferences jury could draw from conflicting evidence) and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Garcia</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch'; n.7 (statement that defendant \"is lying,\" though not to be encouraged, is proper \"commentary on the implausibility of the defendant's story\"), we cannot say that counsel's conduct was constitutionally deficient.

On February 15, 1991, a paid informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) arranged to purchase from Rodrigo Sostre, one of appellant's co-defendants, a kilogram of cocaine for $28,000.  During one of their telephone conversations (which was recorded), Sostre told the informant that his \"source\" for the cocaine was about to arrive at his (Sostre's) apartment.  A few minutes later, appellant drove up to the apartment building, went inside and came back out with Sostre.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">On February 19, 1991, the final arrangements for the drug transaction took place.  During another recorded phone call, Sostre told the informant that he was on his way to meet his source to discuss where the deal would occur.  Shortly thereafter, Sostre was seen entering appellant's apartment building.  Sostre then instructed the informant that the sale would take place at Sostre's apartment.  After further negotiations at which the informant and his \"business partner,\" Anthony Roberto, an undercover DEA agent, were present, it was agreed that Sostre would activate the informant's beeper when the cocaine arrived.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch'; they then went to Sostre's apartment.  A few minutes after their arrival, the informant's beeper sounded.  When the informant and Roberto arrived at Sostre's apartment, Sanchez, Hernandez and appellant were already inside.  When questioned by Roberto why three people were necessary, Sostre replied that that was the way he did business.  The arrest ensued.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Appellant testified at trial.  He claimed that when Sostre visited him on the 19th, they arranged to meet later in the day.  He denied having gotten into the car with Hernandez and Sanchez.  Rather, he stated, he had walked to Sostre's apartment and had arrived at the same time as his co-defendants, whom he did not know.  He averred that he was there, as arranged, to have a beer with Sostre.  He therefore sat apart from the others while the drug transaction occurred.  He testified that he was unaware of the sale of cocaine, that he could not hear the conversation between his co-defendants, the informant and Roberto, and that he could not see the contents of the bag that contained the cocaine.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">II</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">To establish a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show that \"the alleged deficiencies in professional performance assumed unconstitutional dimensions . . . .\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Barrett</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584145\"><a href=\"/opinion/584145/james-barrett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1193 (1st Cir. 1992).

In so doing, we viewed the comment in light of all of the circumstances.  In addition to the length of the trial, the length of closing arguments and the development of the issue of credibility of the government's witnesses, \"there was the key factor of the substantial evidence of appellants' guilt.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> at 556.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Appellant argues that this \"key factor\" is missing in his case because all of the evidence connecting him to the crime was circumstantial.

We are not reviewing the prosecutor's comment to see whether it constituted plain error.  Rather, we are deciding whether appellant's counsel provided ineffective assistance to appellant by </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">failing to object</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> to the comment.  This issue turns on whether counsel's conduct \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Murchu</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, 926 F.2d at 58.  Thus, considerations such as whether the comment was made on rebuttal and whether the evidence against appellant was substantial are only part of the equation.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">The cases discussed above persuade us that in these circumstances, counsel's behavior was well within the wide range of acceptable assistance.  The decision whether to object during a closing argument is plainly a tactical choice.  For instance, counsel may not have wanted to risk drawing attention to the conflicting stories.  Further, when credibility is placed in issue by a defendant's choice to take the stand and present his side of the story, as here, the law in our circuit permits a prosecutor to comment on the motivation of the defendant.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Smith</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, 982 F.2d at 683.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Given the range and type of prosecutorial argument we have allowed in such a situation, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">see</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">e.g.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\"> (comment that witness and defendant had \"concocted\" their story proper as it suggested inferences jury could draw from conflicting evidence) and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch';\">Garcia</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10 Pitch'; n.7 (statement that defendant \"is lying,\" though not to be encouraged, is proper \"commentary on the implausibility of the defendant's story\"), we cannot say that counsel's conduct was constitutionally deficient.
