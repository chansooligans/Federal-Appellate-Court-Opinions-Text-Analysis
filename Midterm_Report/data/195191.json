It was  later\n\ndetermined that the  cocaine amounted to 38 grams  of a very\n\npure  mixture.    The  Commonwealth  charged   Sabetti  with\n\nviolating a statute that, at the time, prohibited \"knowingly\n                                                            \n\npossessing with intent  to distribute twenty-eight  grams or\n\nmore of cocaine.\"   Mass.

The trial court, finding the\n\nevidence insufficient to show specific knowledge of 28 grams\n\nor more, set  aside the verdict.  But,  the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt reinstated the verdict, on the ground that the statute\n\ndoes not  require the  government to  prove the  defendant's\n\nactual knowledge of amount -- though, we add, the facts here\n\nindicate that the amount was reasonably foreseeable.\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          Sabetti  now  seeks  federal  habeas  corpus.

As both  sides also seem to  agree, a\n\ncriminal statute fails to provide  fair notice if a  \"person\n                      \n\nof  ordinary   intelligence,\"  Harriss,  347  U.S.  at  617,\n                                      \n\n\"examining [only] the language of the statute,\" Colon-Ortiz,\n                                                           \n\n866  F.2d at  9, would  be  in some  way  surprised that  it\n\nprohibited the conduct in question.   \"It is not enough,\" we\n\nhave explained, for  the true meaning of the  statute \"to be\n\napparent  elsewhere,\"  in  extra-textual materials  such  as\n                   \n\nlegislative history   or analogous statutes.   Id. (emphasis\n                                                 \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nadded).   The idea  is that ordinary  individuals trying  to\n\nconform  their conduct  to law  should be able  to do  so by\n\nreading the face of a statute --  not by having to appeal to\n                \n\noutside legal  materials.  At  the same time, the  person of\n\nordinary intelligence is also a person of common sense, with\n\nknowledge of \"common understanding[s] and practices,\" Jordan\n                                                            \n\nv. De George, 341 U.S.  223, 232 (1951) (citation  omitted),\n            \n\nwhich he brings fully to  bear in \"examining the language of\n\nthe statute.\"\n\n          In  this  case, we  do  not  think  the person  of\n\nordinary  intelligence would be  the least bit  surprised to\n\nlearn that  the pertinent  statutory language  -- \"knowingly\n\npossessing with intent  to distribute twenty-eight grams  or\n\nmore of cocaine\"   -- was construed to  prohibit the conduct\n\nfor which  Sabetti was convicted:  knowingly possessing with\n\nintent  to distribute an  amount of  cocaine that  one might\n\nreasonably  foresee would  amount to  at least 28  grams but\n\nwhich the defendant did not actually know weighed that much.\n                                    \n\nWe acknowledge that,  if one reads the statute  in a vacuum,\n                                                           \n\none  might think  the word  \"knowingly\" could  as easily  be\n\nconstrued to apply to the words \"twenty-eight grams\" as not.\n\nBut, bringing common sense to bear, we have little doubt the\n\naverage  person  would  be  skeptical  of  the  idea   of  a\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nlegislature really insisting that a prosecutor prove  actual\n\nknowledge of a precise amount -- often an impossible task --\n\nrather than knowledge  simply of a  small amount (e.g.,  two\n\nplastic bags'  worth) that could  easily turn out  to weigh,\n\nsay, an  ounce.  After all, most people know that the degree\n\nof  harm  drugs  cause  in  the world  is  related,  not  to\n\nperceived amounts of drugs, but to actual amounts.\n                                         \n\n          Our  conclusion is supported  by the fact  that we\n\nhave searched the case law and have not found cases in which\n\na garden-variety,  textual ambiguity  of the  kind at  issue\n\nhere  has risen  to the  level of  a due  process violation.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Stout v. Dallman,  492 F.2d 992 (6th  Cir. 1974)\n                            \n\n(finding,  on habeas review, no \"fair notice\" violation when\n\nstate  court  construed  armed  robbery  statute   requiring\n\ndefendant to  be  \"armed  with a  pistol,  knife,  or  other\n                                                            \n\ndangerous  weapon\" to cover defendant who smacked his victim\n                 \n\non  the head  with an  unidentified  hard object)  (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          Nor is this surprising.  Legislators need not, and\n\noften  cannot, draft statutes  with perfect precision.   See\n                                                            \n\nStansberry  v. Holmes,  613 F.2d 1285,  1289 (5th  Cir.) (\"A\n                     \n\nprovision  need  not  . .  .  be  cast  in  terms  that  are\n\nmathematically  precise . . . .\") (citations omitted), cert.\n                                                            \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ndenied, 449 U.S.  886 (1980).  If  run-of-the-mill statutory\n      \n\nambiguities  were  enough to  violate  the Constitution,  no\n                 \n\ncourt   could   ever  clarify   statutes   through  judicial\n\ninterpretation,  for  the  first  person  against  whom  the\n\nclarified  version applied (and likely others as well) could\n\nargue that  he  was  unfairly surprised  and  thus  his  due\n\nprocess  rights were violated.   Courts, of  course, clarify\n\ntextual ambiguities all the time.\n\n          We have found cases,  to be sure, in  which courts\n                 \n\nseem  wary  of  run-of-the-mill statutory  ambiguities,  but\n\nthese  cases  tend  to  involve  statutes  that  criminalize\n\nconduct  that   the  average   person  generally   considers\n\ninnocent.   See,  e.g.,  Kolender v.  Lawson,  461 U.S.  352\n                                            \n\n(1983)  (statute  restricting  persons  from  wandering  the\n\nstreets without identification); United  States v. Anzalone,\n                                                           \n\n766 F.2d 676 (1st Cir. 1985) (statute requiring reporting of\n\ncurrency  transactions over  $10,000).   Of  course, even  a\n\nsmall degree of  ambiguity, when construed to  prohibit what\n\nwould  otherwise reasonably seem to be innocent conduct, can\n\ncause  significant  surprise.   The  instant  case  is quite\n\ndifferent: no one thinks that cocaine drug dealing, even  in\n\nsmall amounts, is innocent conduct.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          We have also  found some cases indicating  a \"fair\n\nnotice\"  violation in a  statute that criminalizes  (or sets\n\npenalties for) obviously non-innocent  conduct such as  drug\n                            \n\ndealing.  But, these cases  tend to involve ambiguities that\n\ncannot easily be  called run-of-the-mill.  In  United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Colon-Ortiz,  866 F.2d  6 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  490\n                                                      \n\nU.S.  1051 (1989), for  example, we  faced a  (federal) drug\n\nstatute that  said that violators  \"shall be sentenced  to a\n\n[minimum  five-year] term of imprisonment, a [limited] fine,\n\nor  both.\"    21 U.S.C.     841(b)(1)(B)  (ellipses omitted)\n        \n\n(emphasis added) (since amended).  The court interpreted the\n\nprovision to mean  that the only  discretionary part of  the\n\nsentence was the  imposition of a fine; the  imposition of a\n\nminimum five-year  prison term  was not  discretionary.   In\n\ndoing  so,  however,  the  court  recognized  that  such  an\n\ninterpretation  flies directly in  the face of  the ordinary\n\nperson's reading of  the phrase \"or both\" and  could only be\n\njustified by regarding \"or both\" as an \"inadvertent drafting\n\nerror\" that should  be \"stricken from the statute.\"   Colon-\n                                                            \n\nOrtiz, 866 F.2d at 10.  Again,  our case is quite different:\n     \n\nas suggested above, the ambiguity at issue here -- whether a\n\nword near the beginning of a sentence (\"knowingly\") modifies\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\na phrase near the end (\"twenty-eight grams\") -- was entirely\n\nordinary. \n\n          Finally, petitioner argues in  his habeas petition\n\nthat  the  \"rule of  lenity\"  (i.e.,  the rule  saying  that\n\nambiguous criminal statutes should be construed favorably to\n\ndefendants) requires a  judgment in his  favor.  That  rule,\n\nhowever,  is one of  statutory interpretation.   We  have no\n\npower  to apply  it  to  a state  statute,  for the  Supreme\n\nJudicial   Court,  not  this  court,  is  the  authoritative\n\ninterpreter of state statutes.  And, Sabetti has not pointed\n\nto anything  in the federal  Constitution -- other  than, of\n\ncourse,  the \"fair  notice\" guaranty,  which,  we have  just\n\nheld, is satisfied here --  that would require a state court\n                                              \n\nto apply  the  rule  of  lenity when  interpreting  a  state\n\nstatute.\n\n          For  the  reasons  stated,  the  judgment  of  the\n\ndistrict court is \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\nNOTE:  See Slip Opinion for Appendix.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n",

De George, 341 U.S. 223, 232, 71 S.Ct. 703, 708, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951) (citation omitted), which he brings fully to bear in \"examining the language of the statute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we do not think the person of ordinary intelligence would be the least bit surprised to learn that the pertinent statutory language--\"knowingly possessing with intent to distribute twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine\"--was construed to prohibit the conduct for which Sabetti was convicted:  knowingly possessing with intent to distribute an amount of cocaine that one might reasonably foresee would amount to at least 28 grams but which the defendant did not actually know weighed that much.  We acknowledge that, if one reads the statute in a vacuum, one might think the word \"knowingly\" could as easily be construed to apply to the words \"twenty-eight grams\" as not.  But, bringing common sense to bear, we have little doubt the average person would be skeptical of the idea of a legislature really insisting that a prosecutor prove actual knowledge of a precise amount--often an impossible task--rather than knowledge simply of a small amount (e.g., two plastic bags' worth) that could easily turn out to weigh, say, an ounce.  After all, most people know that the degree of harm drugs cause in the world is related, not to perceived amounts of drugs, but to actual amounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is supported by the fact that we have searched the case law and have not found cases in which a garden-variety, textual ambiguity of the kind at issue here has risen to the level of a due process violation.  See, e.g., Stout v. Dallman, 492 F.2d 992 (6th Cir.1974) (finding, on habeas review, no \"fair notice\" violation when state court construed armed robbery statute requiring defendant to be \"armed with a pistol, knife, or other dangerous weapon\" to cover defendant who smacked his victim on the head with an unidentified hard object) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this surprising.

If run-of-the-mill statutory ambiguities were enough to violate the Constitution, no court could ever clarify statutes through judicial interpretation, for the first person against whom the clarified version applied (and likely others as well) could argue that he was unfairly surprised and thus his due process rights were violated.

But, these cases tend to involve ambiguities that cannot easily be called run-of-the-mill.  In United States v. Colon-Ortiz, 866 F.2d 6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1051, 109 S.Ct. 1966, 104 L.Ed.2d 434 (1989), for example, we faced a (federal) drug statute that said that violators \"shall be sentenced to a [minimum five-year] term of imprisonment, a [limited] fine, or both.\"  21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B) (ellipses omitted) (emphasis added) (since amended).  The court interpreted the provision to mean that the only discretionary part of the sentence was the imposition of a fine;  the imposition of a minimum five-year prison term was not discretionary.  In doing so, however, the court recognized that such an interpretation flies directly in the face of the ordinary person's reading of the phrase \"or both\" and could only be justified by regarding \"or both\" as an \"inadvertent drafting error\" that should be \"stricken from the statute.\"  Colon-Ortiz, 866 F.2d at 10.

It was later determined that the cocaine amounted to 38 grams of a very pure mixture.  The Commonwealth charged Sabetti with violating a statute that, at the time, prohibited \"knowingly possessing with intent to distribute twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine.\"   Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 94C, Sec. 32E(b) (West 1984) (ellipses omitted) (emphasis added) (statute reprinted in appendix).  The trial judge instructed the jury that to convict Sabetti it must find, in effect, 1) that he knowingly possessed the two bags (with intent to distribute the cocaine) and 2) that he actually knew that the bags contained at least 28 grams of cocaine (i.e., an ounce).  The jury found Sabetti guilty.  The trial court, finding the evidence insufficient to show specific knowledge of 28 grams or more, set aside the verdict.  But, the Supreme Judicial Court reinstated the verdict, on the ground that the statute does not require the government to prove the defendant's actual knowledge of amount--though, we add, the facts here indicate that the amount was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetti now seeks federal habeas corpus.
