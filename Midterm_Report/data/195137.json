The  district   court's  denial  of\n                     \n\nappellant Samuel Concemi's motion to vacate sentence under 28\n\nU.S.C.     2255 is  affirmed  substantially  for the  reasons\n\nstated in  the district court's December  11, 1992 memorandum\n\nand order.\n\n          Ten of the claims advanced by Concemi in his   2255\n\npetition  were dismissed by the  district court on the ground\n\nthat  they \"were either  directly addressed  by the  Court of\n\nAppeals [in  Concemi's  direct appeal  from  his  conviction,\n\nUnited  States v. Concemi, 957  F.2d 942 (1st  Cir. 1992)] or\n                         \n\nwere  matters considered to  be within the  discretion of the\n\ntrial court.\"  We note that four of these ten claims were not\n\nexpressly  dealt with  by this court  in Concemi.  These four\n                                                \n\nclaims, nevertheless,  were properly subject to  dismissal on\n\nother grounds.\n\n          These four,  related  claims were  as follows:  (1)\n\nthat the sentencing judge erred by denying  without a hearing\n\nConcemi's motion that the court determine relative degrees of\n\nculpability  of  all  the  defendants  convicted  in  various\n\nindependent  cases -- not  just Concemi's case  -- of similar\n\nfraud involving  ComFed; (2) that the  sentencing judge erred\n\nby  failing to find Concemi a minimal or minor participant in\n\nthe conspiracy;  (3) that  the disparity in  sentence between\n\nConcemi  and his  two  co-defendants violated  the sentencing\n\nguidelines; and  (4) that  the disparity in  sentence between\n\nConcemi  and  all   the  defendants   convicted  in   various\n\nindependent cases of similar fraud involving  ComFed violated\n\nthe sentencing guidelines.\n\n          The first two of  these claims are not specifically\n\npressed  in Concemi's  brief  on appeal  and are  accordingly\n\nwaived.  United States  v. Michaud, 925 F.2d 37, 43  n.8 (1st\n                                  \n\nCir. 1991).  In any event, as the government points out, this\n\ncourt in  Concemi, after reviewing the  evidence presented at\n                 \n\ntrial, stated  that \"the  mutual cooperation of  Concemi\" and\n\nhis two co-defendants \"was essential in  order to execute the\n\nscheme  to  use secondary  mortgages  and  conceal them  from\n\nComFed.\"  Id. at  950.  Given Concemi's \"essential\"  role, it\n            \n\nwas  certainly  not clear  error  for the  district  court to\n\nconclude that Concemi had played more than a minimal or minor\n\nrole in the offense.  \n\n          Concemi argued in his   2255 petition that his role\n\nwas  nevertheless minimal  or minor  relative to  the larger,\n\noverall series of frauds involving ComFed, most of which were\n\nnot  at  issue in  Concemi's trial.    We have  already held,\n\nhowever, in another case involving fraud against ComFed, that\n\na  defendant's  role  in  the offense  under  the  sentencing\n\nguidelines must  be determined with regard  to the particular\n\noffenses for  which the  defendant is charged  and sentenced,\n\nwhatever may be the defendant's relative role in  some \"wider\n\nweb  of  fraud\" that  extends  well  beyond  the  offense  of\n\n                             -3-\n\nconviction.  United  States v.  Gregorio, 956  F.2d 341,  344\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Given  these  considerations, the  sentencing judge\n\ncertainly did  not abuse his discretion in  declining to hold\n\nan evidentiary hearing on these matters.\n\n          Concemi's  objection  to   the  alleged   disparity\n\nbetween  his sentence and others'  sentences is meritless.  A\n\nsentence  that is valid on its own terms under the sentencing\n\nguidelines remains valid without regard to  sentences imposed\n\non  other defendants in the case, or in other cases, that are\n\nalleged to be  inconsistent.  United States v.  Figueroa, 976\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1446,  1460 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (quoting United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nWogan, 938 F.2d 1446,  1448 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt.  441  (1991))  (\"Even   a  'perceived  need  to  equalize\n\nsentencing  outcomes  for  similarly  situated  codefendants,\n\nwithout more,  will not  permit a  departure from a  properly\n\ncalculated  guideline sentencing range'\"),  cert. denied, 113\n                                                        \n\nS. Ct.  1346 (1993); United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n256, 261  (1st Cir.) (notwithstanding defendant's  claim of a\n\nvindictive   disparity  in   sentencing  vis-a-vis   his  co-\n\ndefendant,  \"we have  no appellate  jurisdiction to  review a\n\nsentence within the applicable sentencing guidelines range if\n\nthat range  was correctly determined\"), cert.  denied, 113 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 220 (1992).  This court, furthermore, already has upheld,\n\n                             -4-\n\nagainst other challenges,  the guideline sentence imposed  on\n\nConcemi.  Concemi, supra, 957 F.2d at 952-53.\n                        \n\n          In his brief on appeal, Concemi also objects to the\n\nsentencing  judge's  upward  adjustment  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice.  Concemi's    2255 petition, however,  did not raise\n\nthis point.  We will not consider it in the first instance on\n\nappeal.  Isabel v.  United States, 980  F.2d 60, 61 n.1  (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1992).  \n\n          Concemi does not, in his brief on appeal, object to\n\nthe  district  court's denial  of  his two  motions  to amend\n\njudgment.   The  second  motion to  amend judgment,  however,\n\nraised  a new  claim  for relief  under    2255 that  was not\n\ncontained  in  Concemi's original     2255  motion.   Concemi\n\nalleged that the indictment against him was multiplicitous in\n\nthat it charged him  with seventeen counts of bank  fraud and\n\nseventeen counts  of making  false statements to  a federally\n\ninsured  bank.  According  to Concemi,  all of  the seventeen\n\nseparate  acts were  merely  part  of  one  grand  scheme  to\n\ndefraud, so  Concemi properly should have  been indicted only\n\non  one count of  bank fraud  and one  count of  making false\n\nstatements.   Concemi  does   argue  in  his brief  that  the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing this additional claim.\n\n          Concemi's   position  lacks  any   merit.    First,\n\nConcemi's second  motion to  amend judgment was  not properly\n\nbefore  the district  court because  it was  untimely, having\n\n                             -5-\n\nbeen filed on January 23, 1993, more than ten  days after the\n\ndistrict court's  December 14,  1992 judgment.   See Fed.  R.\n                                                    \n\nCiv. P.  59(e) (a motion to  alter or amend judgment  must be\n\nserved  within ten days after  entry of judgment).   We agree\n\nwith the  government that,  Concemi's original    2255 motion\n\nhaving already  been rejected,  Concemi should  properly have\n\nbrought any additional    2255 claims in a successive    2255\n\nmotion, rather than \"under the  guise of a late-filed  motion\n\nto amend judgment.\"\n\n          Even were  we to  disregard these objections  -- as\n\nwell as  Concemi's  failure to  raise  this claim  on  direct\n\nappeal -- we see no merit to the claim in any event.  Concemi\n\nrelies  on United  States v.  Lilly, 983  F.2d 300  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1992), in  which we found multiplicitous  an indictment which\n\ncharged the defendant with over twenty counts of  bank fraud,\n\neven though the  over twenty separate  acts of fraud  alleged\n\nwere all directed to defrauding  a single bank in  connection\n\nwith a single loan.  We concluded that the facts of that case\n\nwere \"more comfortably categorized as a single execution of a\n\nscheme rather than as  twenty-some-odd separate executions of\n\na scheme.\"   Id. at 303.   In the instant  case, by contrast,\n               \n\nConcemi was charged with defrauding ComFed in connection with\n\nseventeen  separate  loans.   In  that  context, framing  the\n\nindictment  in terms of seventeen separate  acts of fraud was\n\nentirely logical and not multiplicitous.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          The district court's denial of  Concemi's motion to\n\nvacate sentence under 28 U.S.C.   2255 is affirmed.\n                                                  \n\n                             -7-\n",

Andrews, U.S. Department of Justice, on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.Mass.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Cyr, Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Per Curiam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of appellant Samuel Concemi's motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 is affirmed substantially for the reasons stated in the district court's December 11, 1992 memorandum and order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten of the claims advanced by Concemi in his Sec. 2255 petition were dismissed by the district court on the ground that they \"were either directly addressed by the Court of Appeals [in Concemi's direct appeal from his conviction,  United States v. Concemi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578607\"><a href=\"/opinion/578607/united-states-v-samuel-j-concemi-united-states-of-america-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1992) ] or were matters considered to be within the discretion of the trial court.\"  We note that four of these ten claims were not expressly dealt with by this court in Concemi.  These four claims, nevertheless, were properly subject to dismissal on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These four, related claims were as follows:  (1) that the sentencing judge erred by denying without a hearing Concemi's motion that the court determine relative degrees of culpability of all the defendants convicted in various independent cases-not just Concemi's case-of similar fraud involving ComFed;  (2) that the sentencing judge erred by failing to find Concemi a minimal or minor participant in the conspiracy;  (3) that the disparity in sentence between Concemi and his two co-defendants violated the sentencing guidelines;  and (4) that the disparity in sentence between</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concemi and all the defendants convicted in various independent cases of similar fraud involving ComFed violated the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two of these claims are not specifically pressed in Concemi's brief on appeal and are accordingly waived.   United States v. Michaud, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555478\"><a href=\"/opinion/555478/united-states-v-hubert-michaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 43 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1991).  In any event, as the government points out, this court in Concemi, after reviewing the evidence presented at trial, stated that \"the mutual cooperation of Concemi\" and his two co-defendants \"was essential in order to execute the scheme to use secondary mortgages and conceal them from ComFed.\"   Id. at 950.  Given Concemi's \"essential\" role, it was certainly not clear error for the district court to conclude that Concemi had played more than a minimal or minor role in the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concemi argued in his Sec. 2255 petition that his role was nevertheless minimal or minor relative to the larger, overall series of frauds involving ComFed, most of which were not at issue in Concemi's trial.  We have already held, however, in another case involving fraud against ComFed, that a defendant's role in the offense under the sentencing guidelines must be determined with regard to the particular offenses for which the defendant is charged and sentenced, whatever may be the defendant's relative role in some \"wider web of fraud\" that extends well beyond the offense of conviction.   United States v. Gregorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 344 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these considerations, the sentencing judge certainly did not abuse his discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on these matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concemi's objection to the alleged disparity between his sentence and others' sentences is meritless.  A sentence that is valid on its own terms under the sentencing guidelines remains valid without regard to sentences imposed on other defendants in the case, or in other cases, that are alleged to be inconsistent.   United States v. Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592204\"><a href=\"/opinion/592204/united-states-v-angel-luis-figueroa-united-states-of-america-v-tomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1460 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting  United States v. Wogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1448 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span> (1991)) (\"Even a 'perceived need to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated codefendants, without more, will not permit a departure from a properly calculated guideline sentencing range' \"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></span> (1993);   United States v. Panet-Collazo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580701\"><a href=\"/opinion/580701/united-states-v-pablo-panet-collazo-united-states-v-ruben-santana-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir.)  (notwithstanding defendant's claim of a vindictive disparity in sentencing vis-a-vis his co-defendant, \"we have no appellate jurisdiction to review a sentence within the applicable sentencing guidelines range if that range was correctly determined\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span> (1992).  This court, furthermore, already has upheld, against other challenges, the guideline sentence imposed on Concemi.   Concemi, supra, 957 F.2d at 952-53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief on appeal, Concemi also objects to the sentencing judge's upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.  Concemi's Sec. 2255 petition, however, did not raise this point.  We will not consider it in the first instance on appeal.   Isabel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595487\"><a href=\"/opinion/595487/maurice-isabel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 61 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concemi does not, in his brief on appeal, object to the district court's denial of his two motions to amend judgment.  The second motion to amend judgment, however, raised a new claim for relief under Sec. 2255 that was not contained in Concemi's original Sec. 2255 motion.  Concemi alleged that the indictment against him was multiplicitous in that it charged him with seventeen counts of bank fraud and seventeen counts of making false statements to a federally insured bank.  According to Concemi, all of the seventeen separate acts were merely part of one grand scheme to defraud, so Concemi properly should have been indicted only on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements.  Concemi does argue in his brief that the district court erred in dismissing this additional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concemi's position lacks any merit.  First, Concemi's second motion to amend judgment was not properly before the district court because it was untimely, having been filed on January 23, 1993, more than ten days after the district court's December 14, 1992 judgment.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e) (a motion to alter or amend judgment must be served within ten days after entry of judgment).  We agree with the government that, Concemi's original Sec. 2255 motion having already been rejected, Concemi should properly have brought any additional Sec. 2255 claims in a successive Sec. 2255 motion, rather than \"under the guise of a late-filed motion to amend judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to disregard these objections-as well as Concemi's failure to raise this claim on direct appeal-we see no merit to the claim in any event.  Concemi relies on  United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1992), in which we found multiplicitous an indictment which charged the defendant with over twenty counts of bank fraud, even though the over twenty separate acts of fraud alleged were all directed to defrauding a single bank in connection with a single loan.  We concluded that the facts of that case were \"more comfortably categorized as a single execution of a scheme rather than as twenty-some-odd separate executions of a scheme.\"   Id. at 303.  In the instant case, by contrast, Concemi was charged with defrauding ComFed in connection with seventeen separate loans.  In that context, framing the indictment in terms of seventeen separate acts of fraud was entirely logical and not multiplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of Concemi's motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
