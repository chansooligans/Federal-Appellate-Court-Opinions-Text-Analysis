Sifton,\nJudge).\n\n       UPON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED,\nAND DECREED that the District Court’s November 20, 2008 judgment is AFFIRMED, its June\n26, 2009 order awarding attorneys fees is VACATED, and the cause is REMANDED.\n\n        Plaintiff-appellee Harwinder Vilkhu brought this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and\nNew York state law against the City of New York and several New York police officers. A jury\nfound in favor of Vilkhu on two claims and awarded him $20,000 dollars in compensatory damages.\nIn a detailed fifty-three-page memorandum opinion and order, the late Judge Sifton awarded Vilkhu\n$671,056.80 in attorney’s fees, $58,221.70 in costs, and $401.26 in interest.\n\n        Defendants-appellants (“defendants”) appeal the District Court’s November 20, 2008\njudgment2 and its June 26, 2009 order3 awarding attorneys fees. They argue that the District Court\nerred by (1) declining to give a jury instruction about nominal damages, (2) admitting “similar act”\nevidence, and (3) awarding excessive attorney’s fees and costs. We assume the parties’ familiarity\nwith the underlying facts and the procedural history of this action.\n\n       With respect to defendants’ arguments regarding the nominal damages jury instruction and\nthe admission of “similar act” evidence, we affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the\n\n\n\n\n          2\n         Although this judgment was dated November 19, 2008, it was entered on the District\nCourt’s docket on November 20, 2008.\n          3\n         Although this order was dated June 25, 2009, it was entered on the District Court’s docket\non June 26, 2009.\n                                                2\n\fDistrict Court’s March 3, 2008 memorandum opinion and order4 denying defendants’ motion for a\nnew trial.\n\n         With respect to defendants’ challenge to the award of attorney’s fees, we vacate the District\nCourt’s order and remand for further proceedings in light of our recent decision in Simmons v. New\nYork City Transit Authority, 575 F.3d 170 (2d Cir. 2009). The District Court calculated the attorney’s\nfees award by reference to billing rates in the Southern District of New York. The District Court\nrelied on those out-of-district rates because the District Court determined that (1) Vilkhu’s counsel,\nwho were located in the Southern District of New York, had a “reputation for a high degree of\nsuccess” in similar cases, and (2) “travel time between the Southern and Eastern Districts is minimal,\ngiven that the principal courthouses for each district are minutes away from each other, on either\nside of the East River.”\n\n        In Simmons, which was decided after the District Court entered its order awarding attorney’s\n    5\nfees, we examined the scope of the so-called “forum rule,” which provides that “courts should\ngenerally use the hourly rates employed in the district in which the reviewing courts sits.” 575 F.3d\nat 174 (quotation marks omitted). We held, most importantly, that “a district court must first apply\na presumption in favor of application of the forum rule,” and “[i]n order to overcome that\npresumption, a litigant must persuasively establish that a reasonable client would have selected\nout-of-district counsel because doing so would likely (not just possibly) produce a substantially\nbetter net result.” Id. at 175.\n\n        Because the District Court did not have the benefit of our guidance in Simmons, the District\nCourt here did not “apply a presumption in favor of application of the forum rule.” Id. Nor did the\nDistrict Court examine whether “Eastern District counsel were unable or unwilling to take\n[Vilkhu’s] case” or whether Vilkhu had submitted sufficient evidence showing that, “had []he\nretained Eastern District counsel instead of Southern District counsel, []he would have received a\nsubstantially inferior result to that provided by h[is] selected counsel.” Id. at 177.\n\n        We therefore vacate the District Court’s order awarding attorney’s fees and remand the\ncause to the District Court to reconsider the attorney’s fees issue in light of our guidance in Simmons.\nOn remand, the District Court should keep in mind that “the most critical factor in determining the\nreasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.” Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114\n(1992) (quotation marks omitted). “Both the quantity and quality of relief obtained, as compared to\nwhat the plaintiff sought to achieve as evidenced in [the] complaint, are key factors in determining\n\n        4\n        Although this order was dated March 2, 2008, it was entered on the District Court’s docket\non March 3, 2008.\n        5\n         The District Court entered its order awarding attorney’s fees on June 26, 2009 and Simmons\nwas decided on August 3, 2009.\n                                                 3\n\fthe degree of success achieved.” Barfield v. N.Y. City Health & Hosps. Corp., 537 F.3d 132, 152 (2d\nCir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the District Court’s November 20, 2008 judgment is\nAFFIRMED; its June 26, 2009 order awarding attorneys fees is VACATED; and the cause is\nREMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.\n\n\n\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT,\n\n                                               Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f",
