Richard  and  Anita Poliquin,\n                            \n\nappellants in  this  court and  plaintiffs  below,  challenge\n\nprotective orders  of the  district court limiting  access to\n\ncertain discovery  materials in  this case.   The plaintiffs'\n\nunderlying  product liability  claim has  been settled.   The\n\ndiscovery dispute lives on, consuming the time and  energy of\n\nthe courts, largely as  a contest between plaintiffs' counsel\n\nand the defendant-appellee, Garden Way, Inc.  For reasons set\n\nforth  below, we  modify  the  orders  under  review  in  one\n\nimportant respect and otherwise affirm.\n\n             I. PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n\n     In October  1990, Richard Poliquin was seriously injured\n\nwhile   operating  the  Super  Tomahawk,  a  chipper/shredder\n\nmanufactured by Garden  Way.   He and his  wife brought  suit\n\nagainst  Garden Way in the district  court, charging that the\n\ninjury was due to the defective  design of the product.   The\n\nPoliquins sought  discovery from Garden  Way including design\n\nspecifications,  sales  data   and  information  about  other\n\naccidents involving the Super Tomahawk or similar equipment.\n\n     In  response,  Garden  Way  sought  a  protective  order\n\nlimiting  disclosure of  answers  and  documents produced  in\n\nresponse  to  specified discovery  requests.    The Poliquins\n\nresisted.  Garden Way submitted an affidavit from its general\n\ncounsel Lucia Miller in support  of its request.    On August\n\n2, 1991, after  a hearing on  discovery issues, a  protective\n\n                             -2-\n\norder was entered  by the magistrate  judge to whom  discover\n\nmatters  had been assigned.   The protective  order said that\n\nGarden  Way  did  have  \"valuable  trade  secrets  and  other\n\nconfidential  information\" which were sought in discovery but\n\nshould not be  made public.  The  order afforded confidential\n\ntreatment to information obtained  through some, but not all,\n\nof the interrogatories  specified by Garden Way, and to other\n\ninformation that had been the subject of the hearing.\n\n     The  August  2  order   also  created  a  mechanism  for\n\nresolving disputes about new discovery.   It provided that if\n\nGarden Way  produced other  information or documents  that it\n\ndeemed  confidential,  it  should  mark them  with  a  legend\n\nshowing that they were \"confidential\" pursuant to court order\n\nin  the case.  If the Poliquins disagreed, they could contest\n\nthe designation by motion  within a fixed period, effectively\n\n15  days from  the production  of the  materials.   The order\n\nprovided  that it \"shall  not terminate at  the conclusion of\n\nthis  action\" and  within 90  days after the  conclusion, all\n\ninformation and documents   subject  to the  order \"shall  be\n\ndestroyed\"  and  a  certificate of  destruction  provided  by\n\ncounsel.\n\n     The  Poliquins  appealed  the  August  2  order  to  the\n\ndistrict judge  who affirmed  it as \"not  clearly erroneous.\"\n\nAn   appeal  to  this  court  was   taken  but  dismissed  as\n\ninterlocutory.    The  interrogatory  answers  and  documents\n\n                             -3-\n\nprovided by Garden Way under the  protective order listed the\n\nnames of other  persons who  had been injured  by Garden  Way\n\nequipment and  included a  number of complaints  such persons\n\nhad  filed  in  other  suits.    The  Poliquins  later   took\n\ndepositions  (under  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.  31)   of  23  other\n\nindividuals  who had suffered such accidents,  as well as the\n\nvideotaped deposition  of Jay  Sluiter, a former  employee of\n\nGarden Way.  The  protective order provided that confidential\n\ninformation   within  a  deposition   transcript  was  to  be\n\ndesignated by underlining the  lines in question and stamping\n\nthe  pages \"confidential.\"  It  is not clear  that Garden Way\n\ndid so in each instance.\n\n     A pretrial hearing  occurred on October  24, 1991.   The\n\ndistrict judge  ruled that the  Poliquins were free  to offer\n\ninformation  and documents  at  trial even  if they  had been\n\ndesignated as  confidential  during discovery.   During  this\n\ncolloquy, plaintiffs' counsel suggested that material offered\n\nin evidence  would be freed  from further restriction,  so he\n\ncould send such material to other  plaintiffs who had similar\n\ncases.   Defense  counsel disagreed  and concluded  by saying\n\nthat when trial is  over \"I will request that  those exhibits\n\nbe returned.\"  The court replied:  \"Correct. . . .   When the\n\ntrial is over, whatever rights you have  . . . to control the\n\nfurther dissemination of the material, you can invoke.\"  \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Trial  began  on October  28, 1991.   During  trial, the\n\ncourt  permitted the Poliquins' counsel to read to the jury a\n\nportion  of Garden  Way's interrogatory  answers--relating to\n\ncertain   of  the   other  accidents  involving   Garden  Way\n\nequipment--but  it did  not allow  the  written interrogatory\n\nanswers  themselves to  be offered  as exhibits  and excluded\n\ninformation  about many  of the  other accidents  altogether.\n\nNone  of the Rule 31 depositions of other injured persons was\n\nadmitted or read  to the  jury, the court  excluding them  as\n\nprejudicial  and of little value.  A videotape of the Sluiter\n\ndeposition was shown to the jury in its entirety.\n\n     During trial, the parties agreed to settle the case, and\n\nthe jury  was discharged.  Thereafter, on  November 13, 1991,\n\ndefense counsel  wrote to the Poliquins'  counsel listing 214\n\nitems  claimed to  be  covered by  the protective  order, and\n\nrequesting that the listed material be returned or destroyed.\n\nSome of the 214  items had not previously been  designated as\n\nconfidential.   Included in  the list  were  portions of  the\n\ntrial record.  It appears that the Poliquins' counsel did not\n\nimmediately reply.\n\n     On November 18, 1991, plaintiffs executed a \"release and\n\nindemnity  agreement\" and  received a  check.   The agreement\n\nstated that \"[r]eleasors and their attorney  acknowledge that\n\nthey  are  still  bound  by  the  terms  of  the  [August  2]\n\nProtective  Order\" as  to disclosure of  protected materials.\n\n                             -5-\n\nIn  a signed  addendum, the  Poliquins' counsel  approved the\n\nagreement and \"acknowledge[d] continuing applicability of the\n\nProtective Order and agree[d] to  comply with the portions of\n\nthis  agreement which  apply to him.\"   The  counsel \"further\n\nagree[d]\"  that he  would instruct  any expert  or consultant\n\nshown  confidential material  not  to disseminate  it and  to\n\nreturn all  documents or  other written materials  to defense\n\ncounsel.  On November 27,  1991, the district court  formally\n\ndismissed the case.\n\n     Shortly   before   the  dismissal,   the   Poliquins  on\n\nNovember 25, 1991,  filed  a  motion  \"for  determination  of\n\nconfidentiality\" asking  the court to  rule that a  number of\n\nitems  listed in  the  November  13,  1991, letter  were  not\n\nsubject to  any confidentiality  restriction.   The Poliquins\n\nargued that their counsel had independently learned the names\n\nof  seven  injury  victims  before  the interrogatories  were\n\nanswered;  that any  information  admitted into  evidence  at\n\ntrial,   (e.g.,  the   Sluiter  deposition)  should   not  be\n             \n\nprotected; that it would be wasteful  of resources to protect\n\nthe unadmitted Rule 31 depositions of victims; and that court\n\ncomplaints filed in other cases, although furnished by Garden\n\nWay  in  discovery and  not  admitted at  trial,  were public\n\ndocuments.\n\n     Garden Way  opposed the motion  and asked  the court  to\n\nseal  pendente  lite  confidential  material  to  the  extent\n                    \n\n                             -6-\n\ncontained in the court's file.  By endorsements, the district\n\njudge  on December 10, 1991, granted Garden Way's request and\n\ndenied the Poliquins' motion.  Then, on January 17, 1992, the\n\ndistrict  court on  further  review of  Garden Way's  request\n\ndirected  that material  subject to  the August  2 protective\n\norder  be removed from the  court file by  counsel for Garden\n\nWay and the  court then sealed  \"all testimony and  arguments\n\nmade during  the  trial dealing  with the  matters which  are\n\nsubject to\"  the August 2  order, unless and  until otherwise\n\nordered by the court.\n\n     The Poliquins  appealed to this court  both the December\n\n10,  1991, order denying its motion and the January 17, 1992,\n\norder  sealing in  part the  trial record.   An  amicus brief\n\nsupporting them  has been filed  by the Association  of Trial\n\nLawyers  of America and another in  opposition by the Defense\n\nResearch Institute, Inc.  There is no hint that the Poliquins\n\nthemselves have any practical interest in the  outcome of the\n\nappeal, but as they are formally subject to protective orders\n\nentered in their  case, we  see no lack  of standing to  seek\n\nappellate review.\n\n                    II.  THRESHOLD ISSUES\n\n     At the  outset, we  face  arguments on  both sides  that\n\nimportant issues have been waived  or relinquished.  To raise\n\nan  issue on appeal, a litigant must generally show the issue\n\nwas  raised in  the  trial  court  by  a  proper  request  or\n\n                             -7-\n\nobjection  and  that  the right  ground  for  the request  or\n\nobjection  was given at the  time.  See  generally Clauson v.\n                                                          \n\nSmith, 823 F.2d  660, 666 (1st Cir.  1987) (collecting waiver\n     \n\ncases).    Even  then,  a  mistake  in  the  ruling  will  be\n\ndisregarded unless prejudice resulted  from the error.  E.g.,\n                                                           \n\nFed. R. Evid. 103(a).  Finally, nothing prevents a party from\n\nconsenting  by  stipulation  or  contract  not  to  pursue  a\n\nspecific issue on appellate review.  \n\n     The reason for  the rules  is not that  litigation is  a\n\ngame,  like golf, with arbitrary  rules to test  the skill of\n\nthe players.   Rather,  litigation is a  \"winnowing process,\"\n\nHowell v. Federal  Deposit Ins. Corp., No.  92-1542, slip op.\n                                    \n\nat  15 (1st  Cir.  Feb. 17,  1993),  and the  procedures  for\n\npreserving or  waiving issues  are part  of the  machinery by\n\nwhich courts narrow what  remains to be decided.   If lawyers\n\ncould  pursue on  appeal  issues not  properly raised  below,\n\nthere would be  little incentive  to get it  right the  first\n\ntime and no end  of retrials.   Thus, while there are  escape\n\nhatches--\"plain error,\" \"miscarriage  of justice,\" and  other\n\nrubrics--an  argument not  properly  preserved  in the  trial\n\ncourt is normally unavailable on appeal.\n\n     Garden  Way argues  that  in the  release the  Poliquins\n\nagreed to be \"bound\" by the August 2 protective order, and so\n\nhave  relinquished their  right  to challenge  the protective\n\norder on appeal.  The argument may have more force as to some\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  the   information  in  dispute  (e.g.,   the  answers  to\n                                        \n\nspecifically protected interrogatories) and less as  to other\n\nitems (anything  arguably \"added\" by  Garden Way's post-trial\n\nletter to previously protected information).  But we need not\n\nresolve  the   matter  because   Garden  Way  made   no  such\n\nrelinquishment argument to the district court when it opposed\n\nthe Poliquins' motion to determine confidentiality.\n\n     Although appellate  courts  have discretion  to  resolve\n\nissues  waived or  abandoned at  trial, Clauson, 823  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n666, this is and  should be uncommon, especially  where facts\n\npertinent to  the issue  are not  in the  record.   Here, the\n\nimport of the release is less clear than Garden Way suggests.\n\nThe release states that the Poliquins are \"still bound by the\n\nterms\" of  the August 2 protective  order, but it is  open to\n\nargument whether  \"the terms\" apply  to all  of the  disputed\n\nmaterial.   The parties'  intentions might be  illuminated by\n\nfacts  incident  to the  negotiations,  but  those facts  are\n\nabsent.    In all  events, we  conclude  that Garden  Way has\n\nitself waived the right  to argue that the release  bars this\n\nappeal.\n\n     Garden Way next argues  that the Poliquins cannot attack\n\nthe protective order because they failed to file an affidavit\n\nof their own in  opposition to the original request  for that\n\norder.  We think it plain that the Poliquins, having made and\n\npursued a timely  objection to the August 2 order,   are free\n\n                             -9-\n\nto  argue that the order was  itself unlawful ab initio.  The\n                                                       \n\nburden of showing cause for the order was upon Garden Way and\n\nthe Poliquins can argue that the  burden was not met (or that\n\nthe order was overbroad) without offering affidavits of their\n\nown.\n\n     Finally,  turning the  tables, the  Poliquins themselves\n\ncontend that Garden Way  lost the protection of the  August 2\n\norder as to various depositions because they  were not marked\n\n\"confidential\"  and  underlined  as  required  by the  order.\n\nGarden  Way  says in  reply  that some  depositions  were not\n\nreceived until  the midst of trial,  delaying the designation\n\nprocess.  The facts  are obscure but need not  be determined.\n\nThe Poliquins'  waiver argument was not made  in their motion\n\nfor  a determination  of  confidentiality  or the  supporting\n\nmemorandum.  Accordingly, this fact-bound  argument is itself\n\nunavailable on appeal.\n\n                       III.  THE MERITS\n\n     The August  2 Order.  Protective orders of various kinds\n                        \n\nare employed in civil cases, ranging from true blanket orders\n\n(everything is tentatively protected until otherwise ordered)\n\nto  very  narrow  ones   limiting  access  only  to  specific\n\ninformation after a specific finding of need.  See  generally\n                                                             \n\nFrancis H. Hare, Jr.,  James L. Gilbert &amp; William  H. ReMine,\n\nConfidentiality  Orders,     4.10  (1988).    The  magistrate\n                       \n\njudge's order in this  case fell between these poles:  it was\n\n                             -10-\n\nbased  on  an affidavit  cast  in broad  terms;  it protected\n\nspecific  interrogatory answers;  and it  set up  a mechanism\n\nallowing  Garden   Way  to  designate   further  confidential\n\nmaterial subject to objection by the Poliquins.  \n\n     District   judges  need   wide  latitude   in  designing\n\nprotective orders,  and the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure\n\nreflect that  approach.   Rule 26(c) generously  permits \"for\n\ngood cause  shown\"  the making  of \"any  order which  justice\n\nrequires\"  to  protect  against annoyance,  embarrassment  or\n\nundue burden occasioned by discovery.  The district court has\n\n\"broad  discretion\" to  decide  \"when a  protective order  is\n\nappropriate  and what  degree  of  protection  is  required,\"\n\nSeattle Times Co. v.  Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 36  (1984), and\n                               \n\ngreat deference is shown to the district judge in framing and\n\nadministering such orders.   Public Citizen v. Liggett Group,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  858 F.2d 775, 790  (1st Cir. 1988),  cert. denied, 488\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 1030 (1989);  8 Charles  A. Wright &amp;  Arthur R.  Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure   2036 (1970).\n                              \n\n     Here, we have  no doubt  that the  magistrate judge  was\n\nentitled to enter the August 2 order.  Some trial judges take\n\na stricter view  of the showing needed  to protect discovery.\n\nBut, in coping with the torrent of material often  discovered\n\nbut never  used at trial,  other judges require  some general\n\nshowing by affidavit and then protect materials designated by\n\none side,  subject to challenge by  the other.  Apart  from a\n\n                             -11-\n\nfew aspersions on the Garden Way  affidavit, the Poliquins do\n\nnot seriously renew their prior attack on the original August\n\n2 order.   To the  extent they do  so, we reject  that claim,\n\nfinding the Miller affidavit adequate to support the original\n\nprotective order.\n\n     This conclusion, however, does not even begin to dispose\n\nof the case.   The Poliquins' main attack  is directed not to\n\nthe  August  2  order of  the  magistrate  judge  but to  the\n\nprotection afforded or reaffirmed under the  district judge's\n\nown ancillary orders  of December 10,  1990, and January  17,\n\n1991.    These  orders  rejected the  Poliquins'  request  to\n\nrelease (1) the Sluiter  deposition and certain excerpts from\n\ninterrogatory answers (read into  evidence at trial) relating\n\nto  other accidents,  (2) court  complaints filed  by certain\n\nvictims (which were not  admitted at trial), and (3)  and the\n\nRule  31  depositions of  victims  (which  likewise were  not\n\nadmitted at trial).1\n\n     Admitted  Evidence.   Among the  items protected  by the\n                       \n\ndistrict  court's  orders  are materials  that  were actually\n\n                    \n\n     1These latter orders were  issued after the dismissal of\nthe case, and under  Public Citizen, 858 F.2d at  781-82, the\n                                   \ndistrict  court   could  not   after  dismissal   expand  the\nprotective order  to create new obligations.   Examining this\n\"juris-dictional\" issue  sua sponte, we find  that the orders\n                                   \nin question represent in  part a declaration of the  scope of\nthe existing August 2 order as  applied to disputed materials\nand in part a refusal to remove prior protection.   Thus, the\norders were within the district court's continuing  authority\nover previously issued orders.\n\n                             -12-\n\nadmitted into evidence at trial: the videotape of the Sluiter\n\ndeposition  and   excerpts   read  into   the   record   from\n\ninterrogatory answers  describing other accidents.   There is\n\nno  issue of waiver here,  for (as earlier  noted) Garden Way\n\nmade clear  its desire to  enforce the protective  order even\n\nfor  material  admitted  at  trial, and  the  district  court\n\nreserved decision on  the matter.  We conclude, however, that\n\nonly  the  most  compelling  showing can  justify  post-trial\n\nrestriction on disclosure of testimony or  documents actually\n\nintroduced  at trial.  That showing has not been made in this\n\ncase.\n\n     We have  no doubt that, in  rare circumstances, material\n\nintroduced  at trial  can be  safeguarded against  disclosure\n\nafterwards.  See Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 11-12\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986).  Material of many different kinds may enter\n\nthe trial record  in various  ways and be  considered by  the\n\njudge or jury  for various  purposes.  The  subject could  be\n\nnational security, the formula for Coca Cola, or embarrassing\n\ndetails  of private life.  The evidence might be offered only\n\nat the  bench and  the transcript immediately  sealed, or  it\n\nmight be provided in a closed hearing, or it might be offered\n\nin public but be hard to  replicate without a transcript.  It\n\nis neither wise nor needful for this court to fashion a rule-\n\nbook to govern the range of possibilities.\n\n                             -13-\n\n     One  generalization,  however,  is  safe:  the  ordinary\n\nshowing  of good cause which is adequate to protect discovery\n                                                             \n\nmaterial from disclosure cannot alone justify protecting such\n        \n\nmaterial  after  it  has  been  introduced  at  trial.   This\n\ndividing line may in some measure be an arbitrary one, but it\n\naccords with long-settled practice in this country separating\n\nthe  presumptively  private  phase  of  litigation  from  the\n\npresumptively public.

While in\n\nsome cases  \"compelling reasons\"  might be apparent  from the\n\nrecord, that is not so here.\n\n     Considering first  the description of other accidents in\n\nthe interrogatory responses, we believe no basis exists for a\n\nfinding  of \"compelling  reasons.\"   Garden Way's  reason for\n\nprotection of  such  incidents is  set  forth in  the  Miller\n\naffidavit.   It  amounts to  a garden-variety claim  that the\n\ncompany's image  among customers will be  damaged through the\n\nmisuse  or distortion of those accident claims.  In our view,\n\nthis  threat  may be  adequate  as  a ground  for  protecting\n\ndiscovery  material;2   but  it  is  outweighed,   after  the\n\nmaterial is introduced in  evidence, by the public's interest\n\nin access to trial records.  See Littlejohn, 851 F.2d at 685.\n                                           \n\n     Trials after  all  commonly generate  bad publicity  for\n\ndefendants.  Specific pieces of evidence are  only details of\n\na larger  picture, often a  very disparaging one,  created by\n\nreports of  the case  in the  press.   This publicity may  be\n\nunfair or distorted,  but the  injury is the  price paid  for\n\nopen  trials.   At  least  in  the absence  of  extraordinary\n\n                    \n\n     2Some   courts   have   questioned   whether   corporate\nreputation warrants  protection at  all under Rule  26, e.g.,\n                                                           \nSmith v.  BIC Corp., 869  F.2d 194  (3d Cir. 1989).   In  our\n                  \nview, so long  as the protective  order permits the  opposing\nlitigant  to reach  the  material--and use  it  as needed  at\ntrial--it is hard to see why the district court should not be\nallowed to safeguard reputation.\n\n                             -15-\n\ncircumstances,  commercial embarrassment is not a \"compelling\n\nreason\"  to  seal  a trial  record.    We  have examined  the\n\ninterrogatory answer excerpts at issue  in this case and find\n\nnothing to alter our judgment.\n\n     The  videotape of  the  Sluiter  deposition  presents  a\n\ndifferent problem  because Garden  Way, in arguing  about its\n\nconfidentiality, made  a proffer  which goes  somewhat beyond\n\nclaims of embarrassment.  Garden Way said that the deposition\n\n          deal[s] with the  internal procedures  by\n          which  Garden  Way  evaluates a  product,\n          market  tests   products  and  ultimately\n          purchases  the product  for incorporation\n          into  its  product  line.     [Sluiter's]\n          testimony and exhibits  deal with  Garden\n          Way's   specific    business   plan   for\n          shredders, business plans for other types\n          of power equipment,  as well as  customer\n          profile    information.       All    this\n          information  is  highly confidential  and\n          proprietary . . . .\n\nNeedless to  say, these  assertions, no matter  how accurate,\n\ncould not provide a basis for protecting the entire videotape\n                                                   \n\nof the  deposition after its introduction  into evidence, but\n\nat  most  only  trade  secret or  like  material  of  unusual\n\nimportance.\n\n     In any event,  we see no  need for a remand  to consider\n\nany  splicing of the  tape.   After reviewing  the deposition\n\ntranscript,  this  court  finds that  the  videotape contains\n\nnothing  remotely comparable  to, say,  the formula  for Coca\n\nCola or  even  an  important  trade  secret.    Garden  Way's\n\nbusiness  methods are  discussed but  there are  no startling\n\n                             -16-\n\nrevelations.    The  disadvantages  of disclosure  relate  to\n\nfuture litigation, not the  conduct of Garden Way's business.\n\nThere  is no \"compelling reason\" here to restrict access to a\n\nvideotape already played in open court.\n\n     We  note  that   a  litigant  like  Garden   Way  has  a\n\nstraightforward trial remedy, one apparently not used in this\n                     \n\ncase.   At the time  that confidential information is offered\n\nin evidence, the trial judge has ample power to exclude those\n\nportions  that  have  limited  relevance  but  contain  trade\n\nsecrets or other highly sensitive information.

This approach will not  solve every problem but, to the\n\nextent  it   applies,  it  can  mitigate   harm  without  any\n\nimpairment of public access to the trial record.\n\n     Public  Records.    The  Poliquins next  object  to  the\n                    \n\nprotection after trial of copies of civil complaints filed in\n\nother courts against  Garden Way by other accident victims in\n\nother  cases.    None  of these  complaints  was  accepted in\n\nevidence at trial.   Nor  do we understand  the Poliquins  to\n\nclaim   that   their   attorney   obtained   the   complaints\n\nindependently  of discovery.3   The  issue, then,  is whether\n\n                    \n\n     3Their attorney  asserts that  he obtained the  names of\nseven victims  independently but then secured  the complaints\nthey had filed from  Garden Way through compulsory discovery.\nIn our  view this makes the  complaints themselves discovered\nmaterial.   Limiting use  of independently obtained  material\nwould,  of course, raise serious questions as to the scope of\nthe court's  authority and under  the First  Amendment.

Yet, one can  easily imagine \"public\"\n\narchival  material   where  difficulties  of   discovery  and\n\nassembly represent  a significant investment  by the original\n\nfinder and  a  barrier to  easy  replication.   Indeed,  most\n\n\"trade secrets\"  are duplicable with enough  time and effort.\n\nThe futility of protecting a \"public\" document might persuade\n\na  court  to deny  protection.   But we  see  no basis  for a\n\nblanket rule  forbidding Rule 26 protection  in all instances\n\nwhere the  \"public\"  document is  obtained through  discovery\n\nunder an otherwise justified protective order.\n\n     The  \"public\" character  of the  complaints is  the only\n\nreason given by the  Poliquins for ordering their disclosure.\n\nWe  therefore   have  no  reason  to   consider  whether  the\n\nmagistrate judge's original inclusion of the complaints under\n\nthe  protective order  was error  for any  other reasons.   A\n\nprotective order may often specify categories  of information\n\nfor protection  without document by document  review, and the\n\n                             -18-\n\ndesign of the order is in any event largely  within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion.  \n\n     The  Rule 31  Depositions.

The issue before us is\n\nnarrow.   The  Poliquins, as  we have  said, have  waived any\n\nclaim  that protection  for  the depositions  was not  timely\n\nsought.    Nor do  the Poliquins assert  that the depositions\n\nmust  be  disclosed  in  order  to  advise  the  public,  and\n\nespecially  the  authorities,  of  an unknown  danger.

In  this case, nothing prevents  the Poliquins from\n\nadvising  the  government  of  their  claim  that  the  Super\n\nTomahawk is defective.\n\n     The  Poliquins  argue  instead  that  disclosure  of the\n\ndepositions is  warranted to  avoid  wasteful duplication  of\n\ndiscovery  in  other  cases.4   The  argument  has a  surface\n\nappeal in  a  time of  swollen  litigation cost  and  crowded\n\ndockets,  but it looks at  only one element  in the equation.\n\n                    \n\n     4The Poliquins' counsel also argues that he has invested\n$5,000 in taking the depositions and should be free to recoup\nhis costs  by using  the depositions  in other  suits against\nGarden Way.  This  version of events overlooks the  fact that\ncounsel  was not  doing  private research  but was  using the\ncourt's  compulsory process  to  secure the  information from\ndeponents compelled to attend and answer.  \n\n                             -19-\n\nAbsent an immediate  threat to public  health or safety,  the\n\nfirst concern of the court is with the resolution of the case\n\nat  hand.   Judges have  found in  many cases  that effective\n\ndiscovery,  with  a  minimum  of  disputes,  is  achieved  by\n\naffording   relatively   generous  protection   to  discovery\n\nmaterial.    Impairing  this  process  has  immediate  costs,\n\nincluding  the delay of discovery and the cost to the parties\n\nand  the court of resolving objections that would not be made\n\nif a protective order were allowed.\n\n     For these reasons, the  district court under current law\n\nretains  broad  discretion  to  protect  discovery  material,\n\ndespite  the  burden  of   re-discovery  imposed  on   future\n\nlitigants in  future cases.    There have  been proposals  in\n\nCongress for \"sunshine\" legislation  to provide public access\n\nto discovery, Court Secrecy:  Hearings Before the Subcomm. on\n                                                             \n\nCourts  and Administrative Procedure  of the Senate Judiciary\n                                                             \n\nCommittee, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.

In all events, Congress has not altered the law.\n\n     Where the  district court does  protect material  during\n\ndiscovery,  it is common to  provide, as the magistrate judge\n\n                             -20-\n\ndid here,  for post-trial protection including  the return or\n\ndestruction  of  protected  material.   In  most  cases,  the\n\nlubricating  effects of  the  protective order  on  pre-trial\n\ndiscovery would be  lost if the  order expired at the  end of\n\nthe  case or were subject  to ready alteration.   See Miller,\n                                                     \n\nsupra, at  499-500.   Nevertheless, a protective  order, like\n     \n\nany  ongoing injunction,  is always  subject to  the inherent\n\npower  of the district court to relax or terminate the order,\n\neven after judgment.

I\n                                    \n\nrespectfully dissent on the ground that this court is without\n\njurisdiction to  hear this  appeal, and, in  the alternative,\n\nthat the  most we have jurisdiction to  do, and should do, is\n\nto  vacate aspects  of the  district court  orders that  were\n\nbeyond the district court's jurisdiction.\n\n               I.

I recognize how pressing  are the interests of\n\nthe bar  and  trial judges  in  having clear  guidance  about\n\nimportant unsettled  issues that are confronted  almost daily\n\nin  the  district  courts.    At  least  equally  compelling,\n\nhowever,   are  the  interests   underlying  limits   on  our\n\njurisdictional  authority.   We  must respect  constitutional\n\nconstraints  against issuing  advisory opinions when  no live\n\n                             -22-\n\ncase or controversy is presented to the court by real parties\n\nin interest.\n\nA.  Interest of the Poliquins\n                             \n\n          As noted  in Part  I  of the  Court's Opinion,  the\n\nPoliquins, nominally the appellants  in this case, received a\n\ncheck  from Garden Way and executed  a \"release and indemnity\n\nagreement\"   that   included  a   provision   declaring  that\n\n\"[r]eleasors  and  their attorney  acknowledge that  they are\n\nstill bound  by the terms of the [August 2] Protective Order\"\n\nas to disclosure of  protected materials.  The  record before\n\nus strongly suggests that Garden Way may have been influenced\n\nto  make a higher cash  offer for this  settlement than would\n\nhave been made in return  for a release that did  not include\n\nthe provision binding the Poliquins and their attorney by the\n\nterms of the  protective order.   Also, viewed  in the  light\n\nmost  favorable  to an  argument  that the  Poliquins  have a\n\nlegally  protected  interest at  stake  in  this appeal,  the\n\nrecord  fails to show that they have any tangible interest in\n\nthe  outcome of this appeal  (if indeed it  does not strongly\n\nsuggest  the contrary).    Also, again  viewing matters  most\n\nfavorably to an argument that the Poliquins have an interest,\n\none may doubt that whatever intangible interest they have  in\n\nthe outcome of this appeal is a legally protected interest. \n\n          The  fact that  the Poliquins  are named  as people\n\nsubject to  an ongoing protective order  does not demonstrate\n\n                             -23-\n\nthat they  have a  legally protected interest  in challenging\n\nthat order.  To  whatever extent the interlocutory protective\n\norder survives  after final judgment  (dismissing the  action\n\nafter the parties reported  their settlement), it survives as\n\na  \"protective  order\"  of  the  court  --  or  perhaps  more\n\naccurately  stated,  as  protective  terms  of  a  settlement\n\nagreement --  only because  the Poliquins and  their attorney\n\nagreed to it.  \n\n          The  Poliquins, and  the  attorney who  represented\n\nthem in effecting the settlement, are barred by contract from\n\nchallenging  the  terms  of   the  order  or  the  settlement\n\nagreement incorporating  those terms.  I  conclude also that,\n\nby  reason  of  this bar,  the  Poliquins  lack  the kind  of\n\ninterest that would give  them standing in this court  (or in\n\nthe  district court, see Part II below) to challenge the very\n                        \n\nterms of the \"protective  order\" to which they had  agreed in\n\nsettling the case.\n\n          The  rule that  a party  who settles a  case cannot\n\nthereafter appeal  a court  order entered previously  in that\n\ncase is confirmed in precedent and is comprehensive in scope.\n\nAny  case  or  controversy previously  existing  between  the\n\nparties is moot after complete settlement.  See Lake Coal Co.\n                                                             \n\nv.  Roberts &amp; Schaefer Co., 474 U.S. 120 (1985) (per curiam).\n                          \n\nAlthough partial  settlement does not  necessarily bar appeal\n\nof unsettled disputes, see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,\n                                              \n\n                             -24-\n\n743-44 (1982)  (case not moot after  agreement fixing damages\n\ndependent  on outcome of appeal), when a party enters into an\n\nagreement  encompassing a  specific  issue, no  live case  or\n\ncontroversy  exists  over that  issue.   See  13A  Charles A.\n                                            \n\nWright et  al., Federal Practice  &amp; Procedure  3533.2  at 234\n                                             \n\n(\"A  partial  settlement moots  the  issues  involved in  the\n\nsettlement,  but not those that the parties did not intend to\n\nsettle.\").  One context in which appeals  have been dismissed\n\nconcerns appeal of a  trial court order of remittitur.   Even\n\nwhen a plaintiff agrees  to a remittitur \"under  protest\" and\n\npurports  to  reserve  a  \"right to  appeal  therefrom,\"  the\n\nplaintiff  \"may not  appeal from  a remittitur  order he  has\n\naccepted.\"  Donovan v.  Penn Shipping Co., 429 U.S.  648, 650\n                                         \n\n(1977) (per  curiam) (affirming circuit court's  dismissal of\n\nappeal).  \n\n          Here,  the settlement agreement purported to settle\n\nthe entire controversy, and the Poliquins specifically agreed\n\nto  abide by the  terms of the  protective order.   Any legal\n\ncontroversy  between Garden  Way and  the Poliquins  over the\n\npropriety of the protective order, therefore, is moot.\n\n          Because the  legal controversy over  the protective\n\norder was  rendered moot  by  the settlement,  we should  not\n\ndecide the important issues argued  before us, whether or not\n\nthe  parties  waived  any  jurisdictional  impediment.    See\n                                                             \n\nDeFunis v. Odegaard,  416 U.S. 312,  316 (1974) (per  curiam)\n                   \n\n                             -25-\n\n(determining that in federal courts, a case is not saved from\n\nmootness by \"great public  interest in the continuing issues\"\n\neven  if that  circumstance  might permit  jurisdiction in  a\n\nstate's legal system).   Resolution of  any dispute over  the\n\nprotective   order   should   be   resolved   under  contract\n\nprinciples, and not the  (moot) legal controversies addressed\n\nby the opinion of the Court in this case.  See 13A Charles A.\n                                              \n\nWright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure  3533.2 at 233-34\n                                           \n\n(\"[Q]uestions  arising  out  of  settlements,  [as  well  as]\n\nmootness  questions  should  be  answered  according  to  the\n\n[manifested] intent of the  parties and more general contract\n\nprinciples.\").\n\nB.  Interest of the Poliquins' Attorney\n                                       \n\n          Any interest  the Poliquins'  attorney may  have in\n\nchallenging  the terms that both the  Poliquins and he agreed\n\nto as part of  the settlement cannot properly be  asserted in\n\nthis appeal as  an interest  of the Poliquins.   Indeed,  any\n\nsuggestion to the contrary  is troubling not only because  of\n\nits inconsistency  with precedents,  to be considered  below,\n\nbut also because it raises a problem of potential conflict of\n\ninterest between the Poliquins and their attorney.\n\n          A  party defendant  may  be willing  to offer  more\n\ncash,  and a party plaintiff may  be willing to accept it, on\n\ncondition  that the  terms  of a  protective order  remain in\n\nforce  after the settlement.  An attorney, on the other hand,\n\n                             -26-\n\nmight  naturally  be  more  or  less  resistant  to  such  an\n\nagreement  than the  client.   The  potential conflict  might\n\naffect   the   attorney-client   relationship   both   during\n\nsettlement negotiations and in further proceedings before the\n\ncourt  after  the final  judgment  of  dismissal.   In  post-\n\nsettlement proceedings in this  case, of course, the opposing\n\nattorneys  were formally appearing not  each in his own right\n\nbut each for his client or clients.\n\nC.  Real-Party-in-Interest and Constitutional Requirements\n                                                          \n\n          Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure  17 requires  that\n\n\"[e]very action shall be  prosecuted in the name of  the real\n\nparty  in interest.\"   Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  17(a).   It may  be\n\ndebatable whether this rule applies to proceedings in a court\n\nof appeals.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 1 (\"These rules  govern the\n                \n\nprocedure  in the United States district  courts ... with the\n\nexceptions stated in Rule 81.\").  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 81\n                                          \n\n(containing no specific provision regarding  applicability to\n\nproceedings  in a  court of  appeals).   Something akin  to a\n\nreal-party-in-interest  requirement  nevertheless applies  to\n\nappeals because  of the constitutional requirement  of a case\n\nor controversy.  See  Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S.  54 (1986)\n                                        \n\n(appellant pediatrician did not have  a judicially cognizable\n\ninterest  in defending Illinois  criminal statutes;  only the\n\nState did, and  it did  not appeal; appeal  dismissed).   See\n                                                             \n\nalso Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2137-38\n                                   \n\n                             -27-\n\n(1992) (the \"injury in  fact\" test requires both injury  to a\n\ncognizable  interest and  a  showing that  the party  seeking\n\nreview is among the injured  and would be \"directly\" affected\n\nby challenged action) (citations omitted).  \n\n          Moreover, the Federal Rules of  Appellate Procedure\n\ncontain a requirement that a \"notice of appeal  shall specify\n\nthe  party or  parties taking  the appeal,\"  Fed. R.  App. P.\n\n3(c), and this requirement has  been rigorously enforced.   A\n\ncourt of appeals is without jurisdiction to hear an appeal on\n\nbehalf of a person  who has not been specified  in the notice\n\nof  appeal as  a  party taking  the appeal.    See Torres  v.\n                                                         \n\nOakland Scavenger Co., 487  U.S. 312 (1988);  Santos-Martinez\n                                                             \n\nv. Soto-Santiago, 863 F.2d  174 (1st Cir. 1988).   This court\n                \n\nhas dismissed an appeal  that an attorney sought to  press to\n\ndecision  after  the  attorney's  clients   had  settled  all\n\ninterests they had in  the appeal.

Conclusion\n              \n\n          In view of the likelihood, suggested by the record,\n\nthat  the only  named  appellants have  no legally  protected\n\ninterest at stake in  this appeal, I conclude that  we should\n\ndismiss  this appeal  unless,  within thirty  days from  this\n\ndate, a submission is filed with this court showing a factual\n\nand legal basis for a determination that the named appellants\n\n                             -28-\n\nhave a legally protected  interest that would be  affected by\n\nthe outcome of this appeal.\n\n           II.  Jurisdiction of the District Court\n                                                  \n\n          In  view of  the rejection of  my position  that we\n\nshould  dismiss the appeal in this case for want of appellate\n\njurisdiction,  I turn  next  to considering  limits upon  the\n\ndistrict court's jurisdiction and  the effect of those limits\n\nupon the jurisdiction of this court.  \n\n          Once this court determines that it has jurisdiction\n\nof  this appeal for any  purpose, I do  not question that the\n\ncourt should  at  least  exercise  jurisdiction  to  consider\n\nwhether the district court erred in making an order in excess\n\nof  its  jurisdiction.    This court's  jurisdiction  may  be\n\nlimited, however,  to authority to  vacate any aspect  of the\n\norders  of the district court that  the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction to make.  \n\n          If  the district  court,  in either  of its  orders\n\nappealed  from (the  December 10,  1991 and January  17, 1992\n\norders) made an order  on the merits (for  example, expanding\n\nor narrowing  the scope  of the magistrate  judge's August  2\n\norder), it erred.  The  district court lacked jurisdiction to\n\nenter such  an order in  a closed  case (a final  judgment of\n\ndismissal,  by reason  of a  settlement between  the parties,\n\nhaving been entered).   See  Part I.A, above.   The  district\n                           \n\ncourt's error  in this respect cannot  confer jurisdiction on\n\n                             -29-\n\nthe  court of appeals to reverse  in part and affirm in part,\n\nthereby  making a different order on the merits; instead, our\n\njurisdiction  is limited  to  ordering that,  insofar as  the\n\ndistrict court  orders appealed  from purported to  expand or\n\notherwise modify the August 2 order, they be vacated for lack\n\nof jurisdiction of the district court to make such orders.\n\n          Just as I  believe it imperative that this court be\n\nsensitive to limits on its jurisdiction over an appeal in the\n\nname of the Poliquins if  they are no longer real parties  in\n\ninterest  (for  reasons  explained  in Part  I.C,  above),  I\n\nbelieve it imperative also  that this court  be  sensitive to\n\nlimits on the jurisdiction of the district court to  act on a\n\nmotion  made on  behalf of  the Poliquins  in that  court if,\n\nbefore the motion was  filed, the Poliquins had ceased  to be\n\nreal parties in interest.   The fact they are  formally named\n\nas  subject to  the terms  of the  \"protective order\"  is not\n\nenough  to give them either a practical interest or a legally\n\nprotected  interest  to   support  their  motion   seeking  a\n\nmodification of a \"protective order\" to  which they agreed as\n\npart of the settlement.\n\n          In  the  district  court,  Federal  Rule  of  Civil\n\nProcedure  17  was  applicable  without  doubt.    Also,  the\n\ndistrict court was under the same  constitutional constraints\n\nas this court with respect to the jurisdictional necessity of\n\na  live   case  or  controversy  between   the  parties  (the\n\n                             -30-\n\nPoliquins)  by  whom the  motion  was brought  and  the party\n\n(Garden Way) against which relief was sought.\n\n          A summary  of the  history of the  protective order\n\nincludes these steps:\n\n          August  2, 1991.    The magistrate  judge made  the\n\nProtective  Order  at  Garden  Way's  request  and  over  the\n\nPoliquins' opposition.  The  Poliquins appealed this order to\n\nthe  district   judge,  who  affirmed  it   as  not  \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"   An appeal to the court of appeals was dismissed\n\nbecause the order was interlocutory.\n\n          October 24,  1991.   During a pretrial  hearing, in\n\nresponse to a  suggestion by plaintiff's attorney  that he be\n\nfree  from any  restriction  against  disclosure of  material\n\noffered in evidence at  trial, defendant's attorney disagreed\n\nand stated, \"I will request that those exhibits be returned.\"\n\nThe  district court replied:  \"Correct....  When the trial is\n\nover,  whatever rights you  have ...  to control  the further\n\ndissemination of the material, you can invoke.\"\n\n          November  4,  1991.   [This  date  is indicated  in\n\nDefendant's  Memorandum in  Opposition to  Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor Determination  of Confidentiality at 1  (seven days after\n\ntrial commenced on October 28, 1991).]  On this date,  during\n\ntrial, the parties  reported to the district  court that they\n\nhad settled.  The court discharged the jury.  \n\n                             -31-\n\n          November  13,  1991.    Defense  counsel  wrote  to\n\nplaintiffs' counsel  listing 214 items claimed  to be covered\n\nby  the  Protective  Order  and requesting  that  the  listed\n\nmaterial be returned or  destroyed.  Some of these  items had\n\nnot previously been designated  as confidential.  This letter\n\nappears not to have been delivered to the court at that time,\n\nbut  apparently  it  was  brought to  the  court's  attention\n\nthrough the Poliquins' motion of November 25, 1991.  \n\n          November  18,  1991.    The  Poliquins  executed  a\n\n\"release and indemnity agreement\" and received  a check.  The\n\nagreement   stated  that  \"[r]eleasors   and  their  attorney\n\nacknowledge that they  are still  bound by the  terms of  the\n\nProtective Order\"  as to  disclosure of  protected materials.\n\nIn    an   addendum,    plaintiffs'   attorney    signed   an\n\nacknowledgement that the agreement was binding on him.\n\n          November 25, 1991.   Two days  before entry of  the\n\nfinal judgment  of dismissal  and seven days  after executing\n\nthe \"release and indemnity  agreement,\" the Poliquins filed a\n\nmotion \"for determination of confidentiality\".\n\n          November  27,  1991.   The  clerk  entered a  final\n\njudgment of  dismissal of  the action.   That  final judgment\n\nmade  no  reference to  the  terms of  the  protective order,\n\neither in  its  August  2nd  form or  as  it  may  have  been\n\ninterpreted or  modified by the district  court's oral ruling\n\nin the pretrial hearing of October 24, 1991.\n\n                             -32-\n\n          December  5,  1991.     Defense  counsel  sent   to\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel and the court a letter, later treated by\n\nthe court  as defendant's  Motion to Seal  Documentation from\n\nits File Until Parties Come to An Agreement.\n\n          December  9,  1991.    Defendant  filed  a  written\n\nmemorandum in opposition to the Poliquins' motion of November\n\n25.\n\n          December 10,  1991.   The clerk sent  the following\n\nnotice to all counsel:\n\n          Please  take notice that Chief Judge Gene\n          Carter has  this date made  the following\n          endorsements on the motions listed below:\n\n          (1)  Plaintiffs' Motion for Determination\n                                                   \n          of  Confidentiality:    \"12/10/91  MOTION\n                             \n          DENIED\".\n\n          (2)  Defendant's    Motion     to    Seal\n                                                   \n          Documentation from its File until Parties\n                                                   \n          Come to An Agreement (Letter addressed to\n                              \n          William Brownell dated  December 5,  1991\n          from  Roy E. Thompson):  \"12/10/91 MOTION\n          GRANTED; Counsel to file a proposed final\n          order within ten (10) days\".\n\nAddendum to Appellants' Brief at 1.\n\n          January 17, 1992.   The court signed and  the clerk\n\nentered   an   \"Order   on   Defendant's   Motion   to   Seal\n\nDocumentation\" as follows:\n\n               After    reviewing    Garden     Way\n          Incorporated's   request   to  seal   all\n          confidential information contained in the\n          Court's file, it  is hereby ordered  that\n          all  such  documentation  may be  removed\n          from  the  Court's  file  by  counsel for\n          Garden    Way    Incorporated.        The\n          documentation which  is to be  removed is\n\n                             -33-\n\n          subject to this Court's  Protective Order\n          dated August  2, 1991.   In addition  the\n          Court   will   seal  all   testimony  and\n          arguments made during  the trial  dealing\n          with  matters which  are subject  to said\n          Protective Order, and any sealed material\n          shall not be  reviewed except upon  order\n          of this Court.\n\nId. at 2.  \n   \n\n          The  Poliquins filed  notices  of appeal  from  the\n\nDecember 10, 1991 and January 17, 1992 orders.\n\n          It  is  true  that   Garden  Way's  Memorandum   in\n\nOpposition   to  Plaintiffs'  Motion   for  Determination  of\n\nConfidentiality does not argue  that the district court lacks\n\njurisdiction to grant plaintiffs' motion.  Instead, it argues\n\nthat  the  district  court  should  deny  plaintiffs'  motion\n\nbecause, after the litigation has\n\n          been  settled,  the  case  dismissed  and\n          Plaintiffs   paid,  Plaintiffs'   counsel\n          seeks   an   order   from    this   Court\n          essentially   reversing   the  Protective\n          Order, thereby permitting counsel for the\n          Plaintiffs to  disseminate this protected\n          information on a nationwide basis.\n\nDefendant's  Memorandum in  Opposition to  Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor  Determination  of  Confidentiality, 12/9/91,  quoted  in\n\nAddendum to Reply Brief of Appellants, at 17.  \n\n          It  is  true also  that  defendant's counsel,  too,\n\nafter the  settlement, in effect sought a modification of the\n\nprotective order.   First, the letter  of November 13,  1991,\n\naddressed to plaintiffs' counsel, listed 214 items claimed to\n\nbe covered  by the  protective order  and requested  that the\n\n                             -34-\n\nlisted material be  returned or destroyed.   The record  does\n\nnot disclose that  this request  was made to  the court,  but\n\napparently  it  was  brought  to  the  court's  attention  by\n\nplaintiffs' motion of  November 25,  1991.  In  any event,  a\n\nsecond  request was made by  letter of December  5, which the\n\ncourt treated as a motion to seal.\n\n          Even  if the separate requests  to the court by all\n\nparties were treated as a  manifestation of their consent  to\n\nthe   court's   exercise    of   jurisdiction   to   consider\n\nmodifications of  the protective order, such  a joint request\n\nmade  after  the  court  had  entered  a  final  judgment  of\n\ndismissal  cannot confer  jurisdiction  on  a  United  States\n\ndistrict  court contrary  to the  limitations imposed  by the\n\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\n\n          This  point is  reinforced by  the comment  of this\n\ncourt  when  dismissing  the  appeal  from the  interlocutory\n\nprotective order in this case:\n\n          The  fact that the parties may settle the\n          litigation    and    thereby    foreclose\n          appellate   review   does  not   make  an\n          interlocutory      order      immediately\n          appealable.\n\nId. at 17,  quoting the  ORDER OF COURT  entered October  18,\n   \n\n1991.\n\n          In view of this history of the protective order and\n\nthe incorporation  into the  settlement agreement of  some or\n\nall of the  terms of the protective order as  they existed at\n\n                             -35-\n\nthe  moment of  execution  of the  settlement agreement,  the\n\nrecord before us  lacks complete clarity about the  extent to\n\nwhich protective  terms survive as  an order of  the district\n\ncourt, even though not  incorporated into the final judgment,\n\nor  only as  terms of  the settlement  agreement between  the\n\npartes, or (perhaps by  analogy to a consent decree)  in some\n\ncombination of court order and agreement of the parties.  \n\n          For  present purposes, nevertheless,  I assume that\n\nthe  district court  is  not precluded  from considering  and\n\nruling  upon any  motion  for enforcement  of the  settlement\n\nagreement.   Also, incident  to such a  motion, the  district\n\ncourt  may consider  any  request for  interpretation of  the\n\nagreement  and --  should  grounds  be  shown for  doing  so,\n\nconsistently with  the law  applicable to  interpretation and\n\nenforcement of  contracts -- may receive  evidence to resolve\n\nany ambiguity in the settlement agreement.\n\n          The motions before the court in this case, however,\n\nas well as the  orders of December  10, 1991 and January  17,\n\n1992, were  focused on proposed modifications  of the court's\n\nprotective order  as  an order  of  the court  continuing  in\n\neffect beyond  the execution of the  settlement and dismissal\n\nof the  case.  The  motions were  not viewed by  the parties,\n\ntheir   attorneys,   or   the   court   as  motions   seeking\n\ninterpretation and  enforcement of the  settlement agreement.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if we have jurisdiction to treat\n\n                             -36-\n\nthe motions in the district court as if they  were motions to\n\nenforce (and  interpret)  the settlement  agreement,  and  to\n\ntreat the appeal from the district court's orders as properly\n\nbefore  us for  consideration on the  merits to  this limited\n\nextent, the more prudent course is not to do so.  Neither the\n\nattorneys  nor the  district  court viewed  the  matter as  a\n\nproceeding to  enforce the  settlement.   Nor has the  matter\n\nbeen argued  before  us from  this perspective.   The  better\n\ncourse  is to allow the  contentions of the  parties, and any\n\nevidence relevant to their contentions, to be developed first\n\nbefore the district court.\n\n          In any event,  exercising jurisdiction over motions\n\nto modify  the protective order of  August 2, 1991  is a very\n\ndifferent matter  from exercising  jurisdiction to  enforce a\n\nsettlement agreement.  If the appeal now before us is  not to\n\nbe dismissed  for want  of jurisdiction,  I conclude that  we\n\nshould (a) vacate the district court's orders of December 10,\n\n1991 and January 17,  1992 insofar as they purport  to modify\n\nand continue in force,  as modified, the protective  order of\n\nAugust 2,  1992,  and (b)  remand  with directions  that  the\n\ndistrict  court decline  to  exercise  jurisdiction over  any\n\nfurther  motion by  any  of  the  parties to  the  settlement\n\nagreement,   or  their   attorneys,  seeking   a  substantive\n\nmodification of the protective order to which they  agreed as\n\npart of their settlement.\n\n                             -37-\n",

Richard  and  Anita Poliquin,\n                            \n\nappellants in  this  court and  plaintiffs  below,  challenge\n\nprotective orders  of the  district court limiting  access to\n\ncertain discovery  materials in  this case.   The plaintiffs'\n\nunderlying  product liability  claim has  been settled.   The\n\ndiscovery dispute lives on, consuming the time and  energy of\n\nthe courts, largely as  a contest between plaintiffs' counsel\n\nand the defendant-appellee, Garden Way, Inc.  For reasons set\n\nforth  below, we  modify  the  orders  under  review  in  one\n\nimportant respect and otherwise affirm.\n\n             I. PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n\n     In October  1990, Richard Poliquin was seriously injured\n\nwhile   operating  the  Super  Tomahawk,  a  chipper/shredder\n\nmanufactured by Garden  Way.   He and his  wife brought  suit\n\nagainst  Garden Way in the district  court, charging that the\n\ninjury was due to the defective  design of the product.   The\n\nPoliquins sought  discovery from Garden  Way including design\n\nspecifications,  sales  data   and  information  about  other\n\naccidents involving the Super Tomahawk or similar equipment.\n\n     In  response,  Garden  Way  sought  a  protective  order\n\nlimiting  disclosure of  answers  and  documents produced  in\n\nresponse  to  specified discovery  requests.    The Poliquins\n\nresisted.  Garden Way submitted an affidavit from its general\n\ncounsel Lucia Miller in support  of its request.    On August\n\n2, 1991, after  a hearing on  discovery issues, a  protective\n\n                             -2-\n\norder was entered  by the magistrate  judge to whom  discover\n\nmatters  had been assigned.   The protective  order said that\n\nGarden  Way  did  have  \"valuable  trade  secrets  and  other\n\nconfidential  information\" which were sought in discovery but\n\nshould not be  made public.  The  order afforded confidential\n\ntreatment to information obtained  through some, but not all,\n\nof the interrogatories  specified by Garden Way, and to other\n\ninformation that had been the subject of the hearing.\n\n     The  August  2  order   also  created  a  mechanism  for\n\nresolving disputes about new discovery.   It provided that if\n\nGarden Way  produced other  information or documents  that it\n\ndeemed  confidential,  it  should  mark them  with  a  legend\n\nshowing that they were \"confidential\" pursuant to court order\n\nin  the case.  If the Poliquins disagreed, they could contest\n\nthe designation by motion  within a fixed period, effectively\n\n15  days from  the production  of the  materials.   The order\n\nprovided  that it \"shall  not terminate at  the conclusion of\n\nthis  action\" and  within 90  days after the  conclusion, all\n\ninformation and documents   subject  to the  order \"shall  be\n\ndestroyed\"  and  a  certificate of  destruction  provided  by\n\ncounsel.\n\n     The  Poliquins  appealed  the  August  2  order  to  the\n\ndistrict judge  who affirmed  it as \"not  clearly erroneous.\"\n\nAn   appeal  to  this  court  was   taken  but  dismissed  as\n\ninterlocutory.    The  interrogatory  answers  and  documents\n\n                             -3-\n\nprovided by Garden Way under the  protective order listed the\n\nnames of other  persons who  had been injured  by Garden  Way\n\nequipment and  included a  number of complaints  such persons\n\nhad  filed  in  other  suits.    The  Poliquins  later   took\n\ndepositions  (under  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.  31)   of  23  other\n\nindividuals  who had suffered such accidents,  as well as the\n\nvideotaped deposition  of Jay  Sluiter, a former  employee of\n\nGarden Way.  The  protective order provided that confidential\n\ninformation   within  a  deposition   transcript  was  to  be\n\ndesignated by underlining the  lines in question and stamping\n\nthe  pages \"confidential.\"  It  is not clear  that Garden Way\n\ndid so in each instance.\n\n     A pretrial hearing  occurred on October  24, 1991.   The\n\ndistrict judge  ruled that the  Poliquins were free  to offer\n\ninformation  and documents  at  trial even  if they  had been\n\ndesignated as  confidential  during discovery.   During  this\n\ncolloquy, plaintiffs' counsel suggested that material offered\n\nin evidence  would be freed  from further restriction,  so he\n\ncould send such material to other  plaintiffs who had similar\n\ncases.   Defense  counsel disagreed  and concluded  by saying\n\nthat when trial is  over \"I will request that  those exhibits\n\nbe returned.\"  The court replied:  \"Correct. . . .   When the\n\ntrial is over, whatever rights you have  . . . to control the\n\nfurther dissemination of the material, you can invoke.\"  \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Trial  began  on October  28, 1991.   During  trial, the\n\ncourt  permitted the Poliquins' counsel to read to the jury a\n\nportion  of Garden  Way's interrogatory  answers--relating to\n\ncertain   of  the   other  accidents  involving   Garden  Way\n\nequipment--but  it did  not allow  the  written interrogatory\n\nanswers  themselves to  be offered  as exhibits  and excluded\n\ninformation  about many  of the  other accidents  altogether.\n\nNone  of the Rule 31 depositions of other injured persons was\n\nadmitted or read  to the  jury, the court  excluding them  as\n\nprejudicial  and of little value.  A videotape of the Sluiter\n\ndeposition was shown to the jury in its entirety.\n\n     During trial, the parties agreed to settle the case, and\n\nthe jury  was discharged.  Thereafter, on  November 13, 1991,\n\ndefense counsel  wrote to the Poliquins'  counsel listing 214\n\nitems  claimed to  be  covered by  the protective  order, and\n\nrequesting that the listed material be returned or destroyed.\n\nSome of the 214  items had not previously been  designated as\n\nconfidential.   Included in  the list  were  portions of  the\n\ntrial record.  It appears that the Poliquins' counsel did not\n\nimmediately reply.\n\n     On November 18, 1991, plaintiffs executed a \"release and\n\nindemnity  agreement\" and  received a  check.   The agreement\n\nstated that \"[r]eleasors and their attorney  acknowledge that\n\nthey  are  still  bound  by  the  terms  of  the  [August  2]\n\nProtective  Order\" as  to disclosure of  protected materials.\n\n                             -5-\n\nIn  a signed  addendum, the  Poliquins' counsel  approved the\n\nagreement and \"acknowledge[d] continuing applicability of the\n\nProtective Order and agree[d] to  comply with the portions of\n\nthis  agreement which  apply to him.\"   The  counsel \"further\n\nagree[d]\"  that he  would instruct  any expert  or consultant\n\nshown  confidential material  not  to disseminate  it and  to\n\nreturn all  documents or  other written materials  to defense\n\ncounsel.  On November 27,  1991, the district court  formally\n\ndismissed the case.\n\n     Shortly   before   the  dismissal,   the   Poliquins  on\n\nNovember 25, 1991,  filed  a  motion  \"for  determination  of\n\nconfidentiality\" asking  the court to  rule that a  number of\n\nitems  listed in  the  November  13,  1991, letter  were  not\n\nsubject to  any confidentiality  restriction.   The Poliquins\n\nargued that their counsel had independently learned the names\n\nof  seven  injury  victims  before  the interrogatories  were\n\nanswered;  that any  information  admitted into  evidence  at\n\ntrial,   (e.g.,  the   Sluiter  deposition)  should   not  be\n             \n\nprotected; that it would be wasteful  of resources to protect\n\nthe unadmitted Rule 31 depositions of victims; and that court\n\ncomplaints filed in other cases, although furnished by Garden\n\nWay  in  discovery and  not  admitted at  trial,  were public\n\ndocuments.\n\n     Garden Way  opposed the motion  and asked  the court  to\n\nseal  pendente  lite  confidential  material  to  the  extent\n                    \n\n                             -6-\n\ncontained in the court's file.  By endorsements, the district\n\njudge  on December 10, 1991, granted Garden Way's request and\n\ndenied the Poliquins' motion.  Then, on January 17, 1992, the\n\ndistrict  court on  further  review of  Garden Way's  request\n\ndirected  that material  subject to  the August  2 protective\n\norder  be removed from the  court file by  counsel for Garden\n\nWay and the  court then sealed  \"all testimony and  arguments\n\nmade during  the  trial dealing  with the  matters which  are\n\nsubject to\"  the August 2  order, unless and  until otherwise\n\nordered by the court.\n\n     The Poliquins  appealed to this court  both the December\n\n10,  1991, order denying its motion and the January 17, 1992,\n\norder  sealing in  part the  trial record.   An  amicus brief\n\nsupporting them  has been filed  by the Association  of Trial\n\nLawyers  of America and another in  opposition by the Defense\n\nResearch Institute, Inc.  There is no hint that the Poliquins\n\nthemselves have any practical interest in the  outcome of the\n\nappeal, but as they are formally subject to protective orders\n\nentered in their  case, we  see no lack  of standing to  seek\n\nappellate review.\n\n                    II.  THRESHOLD ISSUES\n\n     At the  outset, we  face  arguments on  both sides  that\n\nimportant issues have been waived  or relinquished.  To raise\n\nan  issue on appeal, a litigant must generally show the issue\n\nwas  raised in  the  trial  court  by  a  proper  request  or\n\n                             -7-\n\nobjection  and  that  the right  ground  for  the request  or\n\nobjection  was given at the  time.  See  generally Clauson v.\n                                                          \n\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491456\"><a href=\"/opinion/491456/charles-clauson-v-robert-d-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1st Cir.  1987) (collecting waiver\n     \n\ncases).    Even  then,  a  mistake  in  the  ruling  will  be\n\ndisregarded unless prejudice resulted  from the error.  E.g.,\n                                                           \n\nFed. R. Evid. 103(a).  Finally, nothing prevents a party from\n\nconsenting  by  stipulation  or  contract  not  to  pursue  a\n\nspecific issue on appellate review.  \n\n     The reason for  the rules  is not that  litigation is  a\n\ngame,  like golf, with arbitrary  rules to test  the skill of\n\nthe players.   Rather,  litigation is a  \"winnowing process,\"\n\nHowell v. Federal  Deposit Ins. Corp., No.  92-1542, slip op.\n                                    \n\nat  15 (1st  Cir.  Feb. 17,  1993),  and the  procedures  for\n\npreserving or  waiving issues  are part  of the  machinery by\n\nwhich courts narrow what  remains to be decided.   If lawyers\n\ncould  pursue on  appeal  issues not  properly raised  below,\n\nthere would be  little incentive  to get it  right the  first\n\ntime and no end  of retrials.   Thus, while there are  escape\n\nhatches--\"plain error,\" \"miscarriage  of justice,\" and  other\n\nrubrics--an  argument not  properly  preserved  in the  trial\n\ncourt is normally unavailable on appeal.\n\n     Garden  Way argues  that  in the  release the  Poliquins\n\nagreed to be \"bound\" by the August 2 protective order, and so\n\nhave  relinquished their  right  to challenge  the protective\n\norder on appeal.  The argument may have more force as to some\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  the   information  in  dispute  (e.g.,   the  answers  to\n                                        \n\nspecifically protected interrogatories) and less as  to other\n\nitems (anything  arguably \"added\" by  Garden Way's post-trial\n\nletter to previously protected information).  But we need not\n\nresolve  the   matter  because   Garden  Way  made   no  such\n\nrelinquishment argument to the district court when it opposed\n\nthe Poliquins' motion to determine confidentiality.\n\n     Although appellate  courts  have discretion  to  resolve\n\nissues  waived or  abandoned at  trial, Clauson, 823  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n666, this is and  should be uncommon, especially  where facts\n\npertinent to  the issue  are not  in the  record.   Here, the\n\nimport of the release is less clear than Garden Way suggests.\n\nThe release states that the Poliquins are \"still bound by the\n\nterms\" of  the August 2 protective  order, but it is  open to\n\nargument whether  \"the terms\" apply  to all  of the  disputed\n\nmaterial.   The parties'  intentions might be  illuminated by\n\nfacts  incident  to the  negotiations,  but  those facts  are\n\nabsent.    In all  events, we  conclude  that Garden  Way has\n\nitself waived the right  to argue that the release  bars this\n\nappeal.\n\n     Garden Way next argues  that the Poliquins cannot attack\n\nthe protective order because they failed to file an affidavit\n\nof their own in  opposition to the original request  for that\n\norder.  We think it plain that the Poliquins, having made and\n\npursued a timely  objection to the August 2 order,   are free\n\n                             -9-\n\nto  argue that the order was  itself unlawful ab initio.  The\n                                                       \n\nburden of showing cause for the order was upon Garden Way and\n\nthe Poliquins can argue that the  burden was not met (or that\n\nthe order was overbroad) without offering affidavits of their\n\nown.\n\n     Finally,  turning the  tables, the  Poliquins themselves\n\ncontend that Garden Way  lost the protection of the  August 2\n\norder as to various depositions because they  were not marked\n\n\"confidential\"  and  underlined  as  required  by the  order.\n\nGarden  Way  says in  reply  that some  depositions  were not\n\nreceived until  the midst of trial,  delaying the designation\n\nprocess.  The facts  are obscure but need not  be determined.\n\nThe Poliquins'  waiver argument was not made  in their motion\n\nfor  a determination  of  confidentiality  or the  supporting\n\nmemorandum.

Protective orders of various kinds\n                        \n\nare employed in civil cases, ranging from true blanket orders\n\n(everything is tentatively protected until otherwise ordered)\n\nto  very  narrow  ones   limiting  access  only  to  specific\n\ninformation after a specific finding of need.  See  generally\n                                                             \n\nFrancis H. Hare, Jr.,  James L. Gilbert &amp; William  H. ReMine,\n\nConfidentiality  Orders,     4.10  (1988).    The  magistrate\n                       \n\njudge's order in this  case fell between these poles:  it was\n\n                             -10-\n\nbased  on  an affidavit  cast  in broad  terms;  it protected\n\nspecific  interrogatory answers;  and it  set up  a mechanism\n\nallowing  Garden   Way  to  designate   further  confidential\n\nmaterial subject to objection by the Poliquins.  \n\n     District   judges  need   wide  latitude   in  designing\n\nprotective orders,  and the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure\n\nreflect that  approach.   Rule 26(c) generously  permits \"for\n\ngood cause  shown\"  the making  of \"any  order which  justice\n\nrequires\"  to  protect  against annoyance,  embarrassment  or\n\nundue burden occasioned by discovery.

Some trial judges take\n\na stricter view  of the showing needed  to protect discovery.\n\nBut, in coping with the torrent of material often  discovered\n\nbut never  used at trial,  other judges require  some general\n\nshowing by affidavit and then protect materials designated by\n\none side,  subject to challenge by  the other.  Apart  from a\n\n                             -11-\n\nfew aspersions on the Garden Way  affidavit, the Poliquins do\n\nnot seriously renew their prior attack on the original August\n\n2 order.   To the  extent they do  so, we reject  that claim,\n\nfinding the Miller affidavit adequate to support the original\n\nprotective order.\n\n     This conclusion, however, does not even begin to dispose\n\nof the case.   The Poliquins' main attack  is directed not to\n\nthe  August  2  order of  the  magistrate  judge  but to  the\n\nprotection afforded or reaffirmed under the  district judge's\n\nown ancillary orders  of December 10,  1990, and January  17,\n\n1991.    These  orders  rejected the  Poliquins'  request  to\n\nrelease (1) the Sluiter  deposition and certain excerpts from\n\ninterrogatory answers (read into  evidence at trial) relating\n\nto  other accidents,  (2) court  complaints filed  by certain\n\nvictims (which were not  admitted at trial), and (3)  and the\n\nRule  31  depositions of  victims  (which  likewise were  not\n\nadmitted at trial).1\n\n     Admitted  Evidence.   Among the  items protected  by the\n                       \n\ndistrict  court's  orders  are materials  that  were actually\n\n                    \n\n     1These latter orders were  issued after the dismissal of\nthe case, and under  Public Citizen, 858 F.2d at  781-82, the\n                                   \ndistrict  court   could  not   after  dismissal   expand  the\nprotective order  to create new obligations.   Examining this\n\"juris-dictional\" issue  sua sponte, we find  that the orders\n                                   \nin question represent in  part a declaration of the  scope of\nthe existing August 2 order as  applied to disputed materials\nand in part a refusal to remove prior protection.   Thus, the\norders were within the district court's continuing  authority\nover previously issued orders.\n\n                             -12-\n\nadmitted into evidence at trial: the videotape of the Sluiter\n\ndeposition  and   excerpts   read  into   the   record   from\n\ninterrogatory answers  describing other accidents.   There is\n\nno  issue of waiver here,  for (as earlier  noted) Garden Way\n\nmade clear  its desire to  enforce the protective  order even\n\nfor  material  admitted  at  trial, and  the  district  court\n\nreserved decision on  the matter.  We conclude, however, that\n\nonly  the  most  compelling  showing can  justify  post-trial\n\nrestriction on disclosure of testimony or  documents actually\n\nintroduced  at trial.  That showing has not been made in this\n\ncase.\n\n     We have  no doubt that, in  rare circumstances, material\n\nintroduced  at trial  can be  safeguarded against  disclosure\n\nafterwards.

While in\n\nsome cases  \"compelling reasons\"  might be apparent  from the\n\nrecord, that is not so here.\n\n     Considering first  the description of other accidents in\n\nthe interrogatory responses, we believe no basis exists for a\n\nfinding  of \"compelling  reasons.\"   Garden Way's  reason for\n\nprotection of  such  incidents is  set  forth in  the  Miller\n\naffidavit.   It  amounts to  a garden-variety claim  that the\n\ncompany's image  among customers will be  damaged through the\n\nmisuse  or distortion of those accident claims.  In our view,\n\nthis  threat  may be  adequate  as  a ground  for  protecting\n\ndiscovery  material;2   but  it  is  outweighed,   after  the\n\nmaterial is introduced in  evidence, by the public's interest\n\nin access to trial records.

In  our\n                  \nview, so long  as the protective  order permits the  opposing\nlitigant  to reach  the  material--and use  it  as needed  at\ntrial--it is hard to see why the district court should not be\nallowed to safeguard reputation.\n\n                             -15-\n\ncircumstances,  commercial embarrassment is not a \"compelling\n\nreason\"  to  seal  a trial  record.    We  have examined  the\n\ninterrogatory answer excerpts at issue  in this case and find\n\nnothing to alter our judgment.\n\n     The  videotape of  the  Sluiter  deposition  presents  a\n\ndifferent problem  because Garden  Way, in arguing  about its\n\nconfidentiality, made  a proffer  which goes  somewhat beyond\n\nclaims of embarrassment.  Garden Way said that the deposition\n\n          deal[s] with the  internal procedures  by\n          which  Garden  Way  evaluates a  product,\n          market  tests   products  and  ultimately\n          purchases  the product  for incorporation\n          into  its  product  line.     [Sluiter's]\n          testimony and exhibits  deal with  Garden\n          Way's   specific    business   plan   for\n          shredders, business plans for other types\n          of power equipment,  as well as  customer\n          profile    information.       All    this\n          information  is  highly confidential  and\n          proprietary . . . .\n\nNeedless to  say, these  assertions, no matter  how accurate,\n\ncould not provide a basis for protecting the entire videotape\n                                                   \n\nof the  deposition after its introduction  into evidence, but\n\nat  most  only  trade  secret or  like  material  of  unusual\n\nimportance.\n\n     In any event,  we see no  need for a remand  to consider\n\nany  splicing of the  tape.   After reviewing  the deposition\n\ntranscript,  this  court  finds that  the  videotape contains\n\nnothing  remotely comparable  to, say,  the formula  for Coca\n\nCola or  even  an  important  trade  secret.    Garden  Way's\n\nbusiness  methods are  discussed but  there are  no startling\n\n                             -16-\n\nrevelations.    The  disadvantages  of disclosure  relate  to\n\nfuture litigation, not the  conduct of Garden Way's business.\n\nThere  is no \"compelling reason\" here to restrict access to a\n\nvideotape already played in open court.\n\n     We  note  that   a  litigant  like  Garden   Way  has  a\n\nstraightforward trial remedy, one apparently not used in this\n                     \n\ncase.   At the time  that confidential information is offered\n\nin evidence, the trial judge has ample power to exclude those\n\nportions  that  have  limited  relevance  but  contain  trade\n\nsecrets or other highly sensitive information.

The  Poliquins next  object  to  the\n                    \n\nprotection after trial of copies of civil complaints filed in\n\nother courts against  Garden Way by other accident victims in\n\nother  cases.    None  of these  complaints  was  accepted in\n\nevidence at trial.   Nor  do we understand  the Poliquins  to\n\nclaim   that   their   attorney   obtained   the   complaints\n\nindependently  of discovery.3   The  issue, then,  is whether\n\n                    \n\n     3Their attorney  asserts that  he obtained the  names of\nseven victims  independently but then secured  the complaints\nthey had filed from  Garden Way through compulsory discovery.\nIn our  view this makes the  complaints themselves discovered\nmaterial.

Yet, one can  easily imagine \"public\"\n\narchival  material   where  difficulties  of   discovery  and\n\nassembly represent  a significant investment  by the original\n\nfinder and  a  barrier to  easy  replication.   Indeed,  most\n\n\"trade secrets\"  are duplicable with enough  time and effort.\n\nThe futility of protecting a \"public\" document might persuade\n\na  court  to deny  protection.   But we  see  no basis  for a\n\nblanket rule  forbidding Rule 26 protection  in all instances\n\nwhere the  \"public\"  document is  obtained through  discovery\n\nunder an otherwise justified protective order.\n\n     The  \"public\" character  of the  complaints is  the only\n\nreason given by the  Poliquins for ordering their disclosure.\n\nWe  therefore   have  no  reason  to   consider  whether  the\n\nmagistrate judge's original inclusion of the complaints under\n\nthe  protective order  was error  for any  other reasons.   A\n\nprotective order may often specify categories  of information\n\nfor protection  without document by document  review, and the\n\n                             -18-\n\ndesign of the order is in any event largely  within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion.  \n\n     The  Rule 31  Depositions.

The issue before us is\n\nnarrow.   The  Poliquins, as  we have  said, have  waived any\n\nclaim  that protection  for  the depositions  was not  timely\n\nsought.    Nor do  the Poliquins assert  that the depositions\n\nmust  be  disclosed  in  order  to  advise  the  public,  and\n\nespecially  the  authorities,  of  an unknown  danger.

In  this case, nothing prevents  the Poliquins from\n\nadvising  the  government  of  their  claim  that  the  Super\n\nTomahawk is defective.\n\n     The  Poliquins  argue  instead  that  disclosure  of the\n\ndepositions is  warranted to  avoid  wasteful duplication  of\n\ndiscovery  in  other  cases.4   The  argument  has a  surface\n\nappeal in  a  time of  swollen  litigation cost  and  crowded\n\ndockets,  but it looks at  only one element  in the equation.\n\n                    \n\n     4The Poliquins' counsel also argues that he has invested\n$5,000 in taking the depositions and should be free to recoup\nhis costs  by using  the depositions  in other  suits against\nGarden Way.  This  version of events overlooks the  fact that\ncounsel  was not  doing  private research  but was  using the\ncourt's  compulsory process  to  secure the  information from\ndeponents compelled to attend and answer.  \n\n                             -19-\n\nAbsent an immediate  threat to public  health or safety,  the\n\nfirst concern of the court is with the resolution of the case\n\nat  hand.   Judges have  found in  many cases  that effective\n\ndiscovery,  with  a  minimum  of  disputes,  is  achieved  by\n\naffording   relatively   generous  protection   to  discovery\n\nmaterial.    Impairing  this  process  has  immediate  costs,\n\nincluding  the delay of discovery and the cost to the parties\n\nand  the court of resolving objections that would not be made\n\nif a protective order were allowed.\n\n     For these reasons, the  district court under current law\n\nretains  broad  discretion  to  protect  discovery  material,\n\ndespite  the  burden  of   re-discovery  imposed  on   future\n\nlitigants in  future cases.

See, e.g.,  Judicial  Conf.  of the  United\n                          \n\nStates, Report  of the Federal Courts  Study Committee 102-03\n                                                      \n\n(1990);  Arthur  Miller, Confidentiality,  Protective Orders,\n                                                             \n\nand Public Access to the Courts,  105 Harv.

In all events, Congress has not altered the law.\n\n     Where the  district court does  protect material  during\n\ndiscovery,  it is common to  provide, as the magistrate judge\n\n                             -20-\n\ndid here,  for post-trial protection including  the return or\n\ndestruction  of  protected  material.   In  most  cases,  the\n\nlubricating  effects of  the  protective order  on  pre-trial\n\ndiscovery would be  lost if the  order expired at the  end of\n\nthe  case or were subject  to ready alteration.   See Miller,\n                                                     \n\nsupra, at  499-500.   Nevertheless, a protective  order, like\n     \n\nany  ongoing injunction,  is always  subject to  the inherent\n\npower  of the district court to relax or terminate the order,\n\neven after judgment.  Public Citizen, 858 F.2d at 781-82.\n                                    \n\n     This  retained  power  in the  court  to  alter its  own\n\nongoing   directives  provides  a  safety  valve  for  public\n\ninterest concerns, changed circumstances  or any other  basis\n\nthat may  reasonably be offered for later  adjustment.  Where\n\nsuch a  request is made to  the district judge and  an appeal\n\nthereafter follows, the  standard of review broadly  speaking\n\nis abuse of discretion.  Id. at 790-92.  Nothing in this case\n                           \n\nsuggests  that the  district court  abused its  discretion in\n\nrefusing to lift the protective order for discovery materials\n\nnot introduced at trial.\n\n     The  orders  of  the  district court  under  review  are\n\nmodified to  exclude from  their scope  the videotape  of the\n        \n\nSluiter deposition and  the interrogatory answer excerpts  to\n\nthe  extent  read into  evidence,  and  the district  court's\n\norders are otherwise affirmed.  No costs.\n                             \n\n                             -21-\n\n          KEETON,   District   Judge    (Dissenting).       I\n                                    \n\nrespectfully dissent on the ground that this court is without\n\njurisdiction to  hear this  appeal, and, in  the alternative,\n\nthat the  most we have jurisdiction to  do, and should do, is\n\nto  vacate aspects  of the  district court  orders that  were\n\nbeyond the district court's jurisdiction.\n\n               I.  Jurisdiction Over the Appeal\n                                               \n\n          The  briefs filed in  this case by  counsel for the\n\nnamed  parties  present  issues of  fundamental  significance\n\nconcerning the  nature and scope of  protective orders issued\n\nby district courts during pretrial proceedings and concerning\n\nsettlements  on  terms  that  leave such  orders  in  effect.\n\nAmicus briefs  (filed on  behalf of separate  associations of\n      \n\nattorneys  who commonly  represent plaintiffs  and defendants\n\nrespectively in product liability actions) reflect widespread\n\ninterest in the bar.  \n\n          The  importance  of  the  issues   underscores  the\n\nimportance  of  this court's  sensitivity  to  limits on  its\n\njurisdiction.  I recognize how pressing  are the interests of\n\nthe bar  and  trial judges  in  having clear  guidance  about\n\nimportant unsettled  issues that are confronted  almost daily\n\nin  the  district  courts.    At  least  equally  compelling,\n\nhowever,   are  the  interests   underlying  limits   on  our\n\njurisdictional  authority.   We  must respect  constitutional\n\nconstraints  against issuing  advisory opinions when  no live\n\n                             -22-\n\ncase or controversy is presented to the court by real parties\n\nin interest.\n\nA.  Interest of the Poliquins\n                             \n\n          As noted  in Part  I  of the  Court's Opinion,  the\n\nPoliquins, nominally the appellants  in this case, received a\n\ncheck  from Garden Way and executed  a \"release and indemnity\n\nagreement\"   that   included  a   provision   declaring  that\n\n\"[r]eleasors  and  their attorney  acknowledge that  they are\n\nstill bound  by the terms of the [August 2] Protective Order\"\n\nas to disclosure of  protected materials.  The  record before\n\nus strongly suggests that Garden Way may have been influenced\n\nto  make a higher cash  offer for this  settlement than would\n\nhave been made in return  for a release that did  not include\n\nthe provision binding the Poliquins and their attorney by the\n\nterms of the  protective order.   Also, viewed  in the  light\n\nmost  favorable  to an  argument  that the  Poliquins  have a\n\nlegally  protected  interest at  stake  in  this appeal,  the\n\nrecord  fails to show that they have any tangible interest in\n\nthe  outcome of this appeal  (if indeed it  does not strongly\n\nsuggest  the contrary).    Also, again  viewing matters  most\n\nfavorably to an argument that the Poliquins have an interest,\n\none may doubt that whatever intangible interest they have  in\n\nthe outcome of this appeal is a legally protected interest. \n\n          The  fact that  the Poliquins  are named  as people\n\nsubject to  an ongoing protective order  does not demonstrate\n\n                             -23-\n\nthat they  have a  legally protected interest  in challenging\n\nthat order.  To  whatever extent the interlocutory protective\n\norder survives  after final judgment  (dismissing the  action\n\nafter the parties reported  their settlement), it survives as\n\na  \"protective  order\"  of  the  court  --  or  perhaps  more\n\naccurately  stated,  as  protective  terms  of  a  settlement\n\nagreement --  only because  the Poliquins and  their attorney\n\nagreed to it.  \n\n          The  Poliquins, and  the  attorney who  represented\n\nthem in effecting the settlement, are barred by contract from\n\nchallenging  the  terms  of   the  order  or  the  settlement\n\nagreement incorporating  those terms.  I  conclude also that,\n\nby  reason  of  this bar,  the  Poliquins  lack  the kind  of\n\ninterest that would give  them standing in this court  (or in\n\nthe  district court, see Part II below) to challenge the very\n                        \n\nterms of the \"protective  order\" to which they had  agreed in\n\nsettling the case.\n\n          The  rule that  a party  who settles a  case cannot\n\nthereafter appeal  a court  order entered previously  in that\n\ncase is confirmed in precedent and is comprehensive in scope.\n\nAny  case  or  controversy previously  existing  between  the\n\nparties is moot after complete settlement.

Interest of the Poliquins' Attorney\n                                       \n\n          Any interest  the Poliquins'  attorney may  have in\n\nchallenging  the terms that both the  Poliquins and he agreed\n\nto as part of  the settlement cannot properly be  asserted in\n\nthis appeal as  an interest  of the Poliquins.   Indeed,  any\n\nsuggestion to the contrary  is troubling not only because  of\n\nits inconsistency  with precedents,  to be considered  below,\n\nbut also because it raises a problem of potential conflict of\n\ninterest between the Poliquins and their attorney.\n\n          A  party defendant  may  be willing  to offer  more\n\ncash,  and a party plaintiff may  be willing to accept it, on\n\ncondition  that the  terms  of a  protective order  remain in\n\nforce  after the settlement.  An attorney, on the other hand,\n\n                             -26-\n\nmight  naturally  be  more  or  less  resistant  to  such  an\n\nagreement  than the  client.   The  potential conflict  might\n\naffect   the   attorney-client   relationship   both   during\n\nsettlement negotiations and in further proceedings before the\n\ncourt  after  the final  judgment  of  dismissal.   In  post-\n\nsettlement proceedings in this  case, of course, the opposing\n\nattorneys  were formally appearing not  each in his own right\n\nbut each for his client or clients.\n\nC.  Real-Party-in-Interest and Constitutional Requirements\n                                                          \n\n          Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure  17 requires  that\n\n\"[e]very action shall be  prosecuted in the name of  the real\n\nparty  in interest.\"   Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  17(a).   It may  be\n\ndebatable whether this rule applies to proceedings in a court\n\nof appeals.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 1 (\"These rules  govern the\n                \n\nprocedure  in the United States district  courts ... with the\n\nexceptions stated in Rule 81.\").  See also Fed. R. Civ.

Jurisdiction of the District Court\n                                                  \n\n          In  view of  the rejection of  my position  that we\n\nshould  dismiss the appeal in this case for want of appellate\n\njurisdiction,  I turn  next  to considering  limits upon  the\n\ndistrict court's jurisdiction and  the effect of those limits\n\nupon the jurisdiction of this court.  \n\n          Once this court determines that it has jurisdiction\n\nof  this appeal for any  purpose, I do  not question that the\n\ncourt should  at  least  exercise  jurisdiction  to  consider\n\nwhether the district court erred in making an order in excess\n\nof  its  jurisdiction.    This court's  jurisdiction  may  be\n\nlimited, however,  to authority to  vacate any aspect  of the\n\norders  of the district court that  the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction to make.  \n\n          If  the district  court,  in either  of its  orders\n\nappealed  from (the  December 10,  1991 and January  17, 1992\n\norders) made an order  on the merits (for  example, expanding\n\nor narrowing  the scope  of the magistrate  judge's August  2\n\norder), it erred.  The  district court lacked jurisdiction to\n\nenter such  an order in  a closed  case (a final  judgment of\n\ndismissal,  by reason  of a  settlement between  the parties,\n\nhaving been entered).   See  Part I.A, above.   The  district\n                           \n\ncourt's error  in this respect cannot  confer jurisdiction on\n\n                             -29-\n\nthe  court of appeals to reverse  in part and affirm in part,\n\nthereby  making a different order on the merits; instead, our\n\njurisdiction  is limited  to  ordering that,  insofar as  the\n\ndistrict court  orders appealed  from purported to  expand or\n\notherwise modify the August 2 order, they be vacated for lack\n\nof jurisdiction of the district court to make such orders.\n\n          Just as I  believe it imperative that this court be\n\nsensitive to limits on its jurisdiction over an appeal in the\n\nname of the Poliquins if  they are no longer real parties  in\n\ninterest  (for  reasons  explained  in Part  I.C,  above),  I\n\nbelieve it imperative also  that this court  be  sensitive to\n\nlimits on the jurisdiction of the district court to  act on a\n\nmotion  made on  behalf of  the Poliquins  in that  court if,\n\nbefore the motion was  filed, the Poliquins had ceased  to be\n\nreal parties in interest.   The fact they are  formally named\n\nas  subject to  the terms  of the  \"protective order\"  is not\n\nenough  to give them either a practical interest or a legally\n\nprotected  interest  to   support  their  motion   seeking  a\n\nmodification of a \"protective order\" to  which they agreed as\n\npart of the settlement.\n\n          In  the  district  court,  Federal  Rule  of  Civil\n\nProcedure  17  was  applicable  without  doubt.    Also,  the\n\ndistrict court was under the same  constitutional constraints\n\nas this court with respect to the jurisdictional necessity of\n\na  live   case  or  controversy  between   the  parties  (the\n\n                             -30-\n\nPoliquins)  by  whom the  motion  was brought  and  the party\n\n(Garden Way) against which relief was sought.\n\n          A summary  of the  history of the  protective order\n\nincludes these steps:\n\n          August  2, 1991.    The magistrate  judge made  the\n\nProtective  Order  at  Garden  Way's  request  and  over  the\n\nPoliquins' opposition.  The  Poliquins appealed this order to\n\nthe  district   judge,  who  affirmed  it   as  not  \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"   An appeal to the court of appeals was dismissed\n\nbecause the order was interlocutory.\n\n          October 24,  1991.   During a pretrial  hearing, in\n\nresponse to a  suggestion by plaintiff's attorney  that he be\n\nfree  from any  restriction  against  disclosure of  material\n\noffered in evidence at  trial, defendant's attorney disagreed\n\nand stated, \"I will request that those exhibits be returned.\"\n\nThe  district court replied:  \"Correct....  When the trial is\n\nover,  whatever rights you  have ...  to control  the further\n\ndissemination of the material, you can invoke.\"\n\n          November  4,  1991.   [This  date  is indicated  in\n\nDefendant's  Memorandum in  Opposition to  Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor Determination  of Confidentiality at 1  (seven days after\n\ntrial commenced on October 28, 1991).]  On this date,  during\n\ntrial, the parties  reported to the district  court that they\n\nhad settled.  The court discharged the jury.  \n\n                             -31-\n\n          November  13,  1991.    Defense  counsel  wrote  to\n\nplaintiffs' counsel  listing 214 items claimed  to be covered\n\nby  the  Protective  Order  and requesting  that  the  listed\n\nmaterial be returned or  destroyed.  Some of these  items had\n\nnot previously been designated  as confidential.  This letter\n\nappears not to have been delivered to the court at that time,\n\nbut  apparently  it  was  brought to  the  court's  attention\n\nthrough the Poliquins' motion of November 25, 1991.  \n\n          November  18,  1991.    The  Poliquins  executed  a\n\n\"release and indemnity agreement\" and received  a check.  The\n\nagreement   stated  that  \"[r]eleasors   and  their  attorney\n\nacknowledge that they  are still  bound by the  terms of  the\n\nProtective Order\"  as to  disclosure of  protected materials.\n\nIn    an   addendum,    plaintiffs'   attorney    signed   an\n\nacknowledgement that the agreement was binding on him.\n\n          November 25, 1991.   Two days  before entry of  the\n\nfinal judgment  of dismissal  and seven days  after executing\n\nthe \"release and indemnity  agreement,\" the Poliquins filed a\n\nmotion \"for determination of confidentiality\".\n\n          November  27,  1991.   The  clerk  entered a  final\n\njudgment of  dismissal of  the action.   That  final judgment\n\nmade  no  reference to  the  terms of  the  protective order,\n\neither in  its  August  2nd  form or  as  it  may  have  been\n\ninterpreted or  modified by the district  court's oral ruling\n\nin the pretrial hearing of October 24, 1991.\n\n                             -32-\n\n          December  5,  1991.     Defense  counsel  sent   to\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel and the court a letter, later treated by\n\nthe court  as defendant's  Motion to Seal  Documentation from\n\nits File Until Parties Come to An Agreement.\n\n          December  9,  1991.    Defendant  filed  a  written\n\nmemorandum in opposition to the Poliquins' motion of November\n\n25.\n\n          December 10,  1991.   The clerk sent  the following\n\nnotice to all counsel:\n\n          Please  take notice that Chief Judge Gene\n          Carter has  this date made  the following\n          endorsements on the motions listed below:\n\n          (1)  Plaintiffs' Motion for Determination\n                                                   \n          of  Confidentiality:    \"12/10/91  MOTION\n                             \n          DENIED\".\n\n          (2)  Defendant's    Motion     to    Seal\n                                                   \n          Documentation from its File until Parties\n                                                   \n          Come to An Agreement (Letter addressed to\n                              \n          William Brownell dated  December 5,  1991\n          from  Roy E. Thompson):  \"12/10/91 MOTION\n          GRANTED; Counsel to file a proposed final\n          order within ten (10) days\".\n\nAddendum to Appellants' Brief at 1.\n\n          January 17, 1992.   The court signed and  the clerk\n\nentered   an   \"Order   on   Defendant's   Motion   to   Seal\n\nDocumentation\" as follows:\n\n               After    reviewing    Garden     Way\n          Incorporated's   request   to  seal   all\n          confidential information contained in the\n          Court's file, it  is hereby ordered  that\n          all  such  documentation  may be  removed\n          from  the  Court's  file  by  counsel for\n          Garden    Way    Incorporated.        The\n          documentation which  is to be  removed is\n\n                             -33-\n\n          subject to this Court's  Protective Order\n          dated August  2, 1991.   In addition  the\n          Court   will   seal  all   testimony  and\n          arguments made during  the trial  dealing\n          with  matters which  are subject  to said\n          Protective Order, and any sealed material\n          shall not be  reviewed except upon  order\n          of this Court.\n\nId. at 2.  \n   \n\n          The  Poliquins filed  notices  of appeal  from  the\n\nDecember 10, 1991 and January 17, 1992 orders.\n\n          It  is  true  that   Garden  Way's  Memorandum   in\n\nOpposition   to  Plaintiffs'  Motion   for  Determination  of\n\nConfidentiality does not argue  that the district court lacks\n\njurisdiction to grant plaintiffs' motion.  Instead, it argues\n\nthat  the  district  court  should  deny  plaintiffs'  motion\n\nbecause, after the litigation has\n\n          been  settled,  the  case  dismissed  and\n          Plaintiffs   paid,  Plaintiffs'   counsel\n          seeks   an   order   from    this   Court\n          essentially   reversing   the  Protective\n          Order, thereby permitting counsel for the\n          Plaintiffs to  disseminate this protected\n          information on a nationwide basis.\n\nDefendant's  Memorandum in  Opposition to  Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor  Determination  of  Confidentiality, 12/9/91,  quoted  in\n\nAddendum to Reply Brief of Appellants, at 17.  \n\n          It  is  true also  that  defendant's counsel,  too,\n\nafter the  settlement, in effect sought a modification of the\n\nprotective order.   First, the letter  of November 13,  1991,\n\naddressed to plaintiffs' counsel, listed 214 items claimed to\n\nbe covered  by the  protective order  and requested  that the\n\n                             -34-\n\nlisted material be  returned or destroyed.   The record  does\n\nnot disclose that  this request  was made to  the court,  but\n\napparently  it  was  brought  to  the  court's  attention  by\n\nplaintiffs' motion of  November 25,  1991.  In  any event,  a\n\nsecond  request was made by  letter of December  5, which the\n\ncourt treated as a motion to seal.\n\n          Even  if the separate requests  to the court by all\n\nparties were treated as a  manifestation of their consent  to\n\nthe   court's   exercise    of   jurisdiction   to   consider\n\nmodifications of  the protective order, such  a joint request\n\nmade  after  the  court  had  entered  a  final  judgment  of\n\ndismissal  cannot confer  jurisdiction  on  a  United  States\n\ndistrict  court contrary  to the  limitations imposed  by the\n\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\n\n          This  point is  reinforced by  the comment  of this\n\ncourt  when  dismissing  the  appeal  from the  interlocutory\n\nprotective order in this case:\n\n          The  fact that the parties may settle the\n          litigation    and    thereby    foreclose\n          appellate   review   does  not   make  an\n          interlocutory      order      immediately\n          appealable.\n\nId. at 17,  quoting the  ORDER OF COURT  entered October  18,\n   \n\n1991.\n\n          In view of this history of the protective order and\n\nthe incorporation  into the  settlement agreement of  some or\n\nall of the  terms of the protective order as  they existed at\n\n                             -35-\n\nthe  moment of  execution  of the  settlement agreement,  the\n\nrecord before us  lacks complete clarity about the  extent to\n\nwhich protective  terms survive as  an order of  the district\n\ncourt, even though not  incorporated into the final judgment,\n\nor  only as  terms of  the settlement  agreement between  the\n\npartes, or (perhaps by  analogy to a consent decree)  in some\n\ncombination of court order and agreement of the parties.  \n\n          For  present purposes, nevertheless,  I assume that\n\nthe  district court  is  not precluded  from considering  and\n\nruling  upon any  motion  for enforcement  of the  settlement\n\nagreement.   Also, incident  to such a  motion, the  district\n\ncourt  may consider  any  request for  interpretation of  the\n\nagreement  and --  should  grounds  be  shown for  doing  so,\n\nconsistently with  the law  applicable to  interpretation and\n\nenforcement of  contracts -- may receive  evidence to resolve\n\nany ambiguity in the settlement agreement.\n\n          The motions before the court in this case, however,\n\nas well as the  orders of December  10, 1991 and January  17,\n\n1992, were  focused on proposed modifications  of the court's\n\nprotective order  as  an order  of  the court  continuing  in\n\neffect beyond  the execution of the  settlement and dismissal\n\nof the  case.  The  motions were  not viewed by  the parties,\n\ntheir   attorneys,   or   the   court   as  motions   seeking\n\ninterpretation and  enforcement of the  settlement agreement.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if we have jurisdiction to treat\n\n                             -36-\n\nthe motions in the district court as if they  were motions to\n\nenforce (and  interpret)  the settlement  agreement,  and  to\n\ntreat the appeal from the district court's orders as properly\n\nbefore  us for  consideration on the  merits to  this limited\n\nextent, the more prudent course is not to do so.  Neither the\n\nattorneys  nor the  district  court viewed  the  matter as  a\n\nproceeding to  enforce the  settlement.   Nor has the  matter\n\nbeen argued  before  us from  this perspective.   The  better\n\ncourse  is to allow the  contentions of the  parties, and any\n\nevidence relevant to their contentions, to be developed first\n\nbefore the district court.\n\n          In any event,  exercising jurisdiction over motions\n\nto modify  the protective order of  August 2, 1991  is a very\n\ndifferent matter  from exercising  jurisdiction to  enforce a\n\nsettlement agreement.  If the appeal now before us is  not to\n\nbe dismissed  for want  of jurisdiction,  I conclude that  we\n\nshould (a) vacate the district court's orders of December 10,\n\n1991 and January 17,  1992 insofar as they purport  to modify\n\nand continue in force,  as modified, the protective  order of\n\nAugust 2,  1992,  and (b)  remand  with directions  that  the\n\ndistrict  court decline  to  exercise  jurisdiction over  any\n\nfurther  motion by  any  of  the  parties to  the  settlement\n\nagreement,   or  their   attorneys,  seeking   a  substantive\n\nmodification of the protective order to which they  agreed as\n\npart of their settlement.\n\n                             -37-\n</pre>",
