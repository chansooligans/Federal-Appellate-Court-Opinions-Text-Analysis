The district court\n\ndismissed their complaint for lack of standing.  We now reverse.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          On January 28, 1992, the  Commissioner declared a state\n\nof emergency in the Massachusetts dairy industry, see Mass.  Gen.\n                                                     \n\nL. ch. 94A,   12 (1992), based on findings that rising production\n\ncosts and flat dairy prices  were devastating the industry.1  The\n\nCommissioner  determined that  a  price stabilization  system was\n\nnecessary.   The  pricing order  issued  by the  Commissioner  on\n\nFebruary 26, 1992, forms the focus of this appeal.\n\n          The  pricing  order established  a  \"Dairy Equalization\n\nFund\"  (Fund), into which each licensed milk distributor (dealer)\n\nin Massachusetts is required to pay monthly assessments (\"differ-\n\nential assessments\") equal  to one-third of  the amount by  which\n\nthe $15  price set  by the pricing  order exceeds  the applicable\n\n                    \n\n     1In 1991, for  example, the average milk price  paid Massac-\nhusetts dairy farmers was $12.64 per hundredweight (cwt), whereas\ntheir average  production cost was  $15.50 per cwt     an average\nloss of $2.86 per cwt.   The Commissioner specifically found that\nthe emergency  threatened Massachusetts' local  \"supply of  fresh\nmilk.\"\n\nfederal minimum or  \"blend\" price per hundredweight  (cwt).2  The\n\ndifferential  assessment   applies  to   all  milk   marketed  in\n\nMassachusetts  by licensed  dealers, whether  produced in  Massa-\n\nchusetts or  elsewhere.   Notwithstanding the  fact that  dealers\n\nmust  pay the differential  assessment calculated on  all out-of-\n\nstate  and in-state  produced  milk, out-of-state  producers, who\n\nsupply most of the milk  sold in Massachusetts,3 are not entitled\n\nto disbursements  from  the Fund.   The  monies in  the Fund  are\n\ndistributed monthly  among Massachusetts milk producers  only, in\n\ndirect proportion  to their  respective percentage  of the  total\n\nMassachusetts milk production,  subject to a monthly  payment cap\n\nto  each Massachusetts producer equal to the differential assess-\n\nment on  2000 cwt.   Excess monies  in the  Fund are  remitted to\n\ndealers in direct proportion to their payments into the Fund.\n\n          Plaintiffs-appellants,  out-of-state  producers,   sell\n\ntheir entire  milk  production to  West  Lynn Creamery,  Inc.,  a\n\n                    \n\n     2The  United States dairy  industry is subject  to extensive\nprice  regulation.  The  United States Department  of Agriculture\npromulgates  federal  milk  marketing  orders,  pursuant  to  the\nAgricultural Marketing Agreements Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.   601, et\n                                                                 \nseq., which establish minimum  milk prices.  The  marketing order\n    \nin effect in Massachusetts is New England Federal  Milk Marketing\nOrder  No. 1 (Order  No. 1).   See 7  C.F.R.   1001 (1993).   The\n                                  \nminimum milk price (\"blend price\") is calculated monthly, using a\nmarket-wide weighted average of the value of all milk sold during\nthe preceding month.  No state or dealer may permit regional milk\nproducers to  receive less than the per/cwt  figure prescribed in\nOrder No. 1.\n\n     3Plaintiffs allege that Massachusetts is not a \"producer\" or\n\"export\"  state (like,  for  example, Vermont  and Maine),  but a\nhighly vulnerable \"consumer\" or \"import\" state capable of produc-\ning only  10% of the milk sold in the  state.  As a rule, out-of-\nstate  milk commands  a high  premium in  \"consumer\" states  like\nMassachusetts.\n\n                                3\n\nlicensed  Massachusetts milk dealer.  Their original civil rights\n\ncomplaint  demanded (i) a  declaratory judgment that  the pricing\n\norder  violates  the Commerce  Clause,4  (ii) the  refund  of all\n\namounts  previously  disbursed  from  the Fund  to  Massachusetts\n\nproducers,  and (iii) injunctive  relief against further enforce-\n\nment of the pricing order.\n\n          The first amended  complaint5 included allegations that\n\nthe  pricing  order  caused  appellants  competitive  injury  and\n\neconomic  harm.6   On  defendants'  motion,  the  district  court\n\ndismissed  the  first  amended complaint  for  lack  of standing,\n\nfinding  its \"general allegations  of economic harm  . . . unsup-\n\nported by any specific, factual allegations of injury.\"  Adams v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     4Commerce Clause violations may be redressed under 42 U.S.C.\n  1983.  See Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 443-51 (1991).\n                              \n\n     5Two  nonproducer  plaintiffs (Massachusetts  milk  dealers)\n                                                                \nvoluntarily dismissed their claims, following the  Commissioner's\nmotion  to dismiss their claims on Younger and Burford abstention\n                                                      \ngrounds.   The remaining  plaintiffs, appellants here,  filed the\nfirst amended complaint, which  dropped the dealer-plaintiffs and\nwithdrew  a claim  for damages.    West Lynn  Creamery, Inc.,  an\noriginal plaintiff, brought  a separate state court  action chal-\nlenging the pricing  order, under which the  Commissioner threat-\nened to  suspend its  license to sell  milk in  Massachusetts for\nfailure to pay its monthly differential  assessments to the Fund.\nOn April 15, 1993, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled\nthat the pricing  order did not violate the Commerce Clause.  See\n                                                                 \nWest Lynn  Creamery, Inc.  v.

LEXIS 19306, at  *4 (D.\n      \n\nMass. 1992).   The  district court noted  that the  first amended\n\ncomplaint contained no  allegations that the plaintiffs  had sold\n\nless  milk in Massachusetts  since February 26, 1992,  received a\n\nlower price for their milk, or were otherwise frustrated in their\n\nattempt to \"undersell\" Massachusetts producers.\n\n          The  district court denied plaintiffs' motion to recast\n\ntheir first  amended complaint by  adding two paragraphs  for the\n\nstated purpose of  alleging \"with greater specificity  'injury in\n\nfact' to meet the requirement  of more 'specific, factual allega-\n\ntions  of injury.'\"    The district  court  summarily denied  the\n\nensuing motion for relief from judgment under Fed.

In its constitutional\n     \n\nformulation, the  doctrine of standing is a  gatekeeper of justi-\n\nciability,  and  \"serves  to identify  those  disputes  which are\n\nappropriately resolved through  the judicial process.\"   Whitmore\n                                                                 \n\nv. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149,  155 (1990).  The \"irreducible consti-\n           \n\ntutional minimum of standing\" entails three elements:\n\n                                5\n\n          First,  the plaintiff  must have  suffered an\n          \"injury  in fact\"    an invasion of a legally\n          protected interest which is (a) concrete  and\n          particularized; and  (b) actual  or imminent,\n          not  conjectural  or hypothetical.    Second,\n          there must be a causal connection between the\n          injury and the  conduct complained of     the\n          injury  has  to  be fairly  traceable  to the\n          challenged action  of the defendant,  and not\n          the result of the  independent action of some\n          third  party not before the court.  Third, it\n          must be \"likely\" as opposed to merely \"specu-\n          lative,\" that the injury will be redressed by\n          a favorable decision.\n\nLujan  v.

As\nthe  Supreme Court has acknowledged, however,  \"it has not always\nbeen  clear in  the opinions  of  [the] Court  whether particular\nfeatures of the 'standing' requirement have been required by Art.\nIII ex proprio vigore, or  whether they are requirements that the\n                     \nCourt  itself has  erected and  which were  not compelled  by the\nlanguage of the Constitution.\"  Valley Forge Christian College v.\n                                                              \nAmericans United  for Separation of  Church and State,  Inc., 454\n                                                            \nU.S. 464,  471 (1982).   Nonetheless,  at least  three prudential\nprinciples bear importantly  on \"standing\".  First,  the litigant\nmust  assert its  own legal  rights and  interests, not  those of\nthird parties.  Warth, 422 U.S.  at 499.  Second, claimants  with\n                     \n\"generalized grievances\" shared  by a large class of citizens and\nraising \"abstract questions of wide public significance\" normally\nwill be denied standing, as such questions are more appropriately\naddressed to the  representative branches of government.

The court noted:\n\n                    \n\n     8Although the Commissioner contends  that the district court\ncorrectly  applied AVX's  \"heightened\" requirements  for pleading\n                      \n\"standing,\" AVX, 962  F.2d at 113, we note no  citation or refer-\n               \nence  to AVX in  the district court  opinion.

See  Correa-Martinez v.\n                                                              \n\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 59 (1st  Cir. 1990).  According-\n                  \n\nly, setting to  one side the first amended  complaint, we inquire\n\nwhether the second  amended complaint alleged an  actual or immi-\n\nnent  \"injury-in-fact\"  proximately  caused   by  the  challenged\n\npricing order.   Id. (suggesting  that denial of motion  to amend\n                    \n\nconstitutes abuse of discretion \"if no justification appears\").\n\n          The second amended complaint, paraphrased, alleges that\n\nthe following chain of economic events will result in appellants'\n\nloss of future income, profits, and business opportunities: \n\n          All milk currently produced  by appellants is\n          sold in  the  Massachusetts  milk  market  in\n          direct  competition  with  Massachusetts milk\n          producers.   As a  direct consequence of  the\n          differential  assessments Massachusetts  milk\n          dealers must pay  into the Fund for  each cwt\n\n                                9\n\n          purchased  from  producers,9   consumer  milk\n          prices  in  Massachusetts   will  rise  since\n          dealers, in  all likelihood, will  pass along\n          at  least  some  portion of  their  increased\n          costs to Massachusetts consumers.10\n\n          Consumer  demand  will   decrease  as  prices\n          increase.  In  this shrinking market,  Massa-\n          chusetts  dealers will  continue  to buy  all\n          available  milk  produced  in  Massachusetts,\n          because of their \"preference\"  for local sup-\n                                                       \n          plies, due to the lower transportation  costs\n               \n          and lesser producer-to-consumer delivery time\n          (perishability  being a  major industry  con-\n          cern).  Higher milk prices and increased dis-\n          bursements from the  Fund will induce greater\n          milk production  by Massachusetts  producers,\n          thereby  lowering the  current 90%  Massachu-\n          setts  market share  enjoyed by  out-of-state\n          producers.   Moreover, even  if Massachusetts\n          milk prices were to remain relatively stable,\n          individual Massachusetts producers would have\n          a  strong  incentive to  increase  production\n          over their  fellow home state  dairy farmers,\n          since  Fund disbursements  are based  on each\n          producer's relative  share of  overall Massa-\n                             \n          chusetts milk production. \n                                  \n\n          As  Massachusetts  producers  increase  their\n          market share, out-of-state milk will be  dis-\n          placed,   and   \"overflow\"   into  interstate\n          commerce.   These  resulting surplus  \"inter-\n          state\"  supplies  will  deflate  the  federal\n          \"blend\" or minimum  price under Order  No. 1.\n          Since appellants previously sold their entire\n          milk  production  in Massachusetts,  some  of\n          their out-of-state  milk will  be \"displaced\"\n          by Massachusetts-produced milk.  As Massachu-\n          setts consumer demand decreases, out-of-state\n          producers will  no longer be able  to command\n\n                    \n\n     9Appellants concede that the Fund's collection mechanism, by\n                                                   \nitself, does  not injure them.  Since  Massachusetts dealers must\npay  an assessment  on  every  cwt  purchased,  whether  produced\nlocally or out-of-state,  dealers could not reduce  their assess-\nments to the Fund by avoiding out-of-state purchases.\n\n     10By proscribing \"unconscionable\"  consumer price increases,\nsection VIII(b) of the pricing order merely places an outer limit\non the total amount of  differential assessment costs dealers may\npass along to consumers.  \n\n                                10\n\n          the  same premium  prices (in  excess  of the\n          federal  \"blend price\")  received before  the\n          challenged pricing order.   See supra note 3.\n                                               \n          Massachusetts  producers  will  be  insulated\n          from any  federal blend-price  deflation, be-\n          cause,  under the  Fund's collection  formula\n          the  greater the gap between $15 and the fed-\n                              \n          eral blend price, the larger the differential\n          assessments  Massachusetts  dealers  must pay\n          into the Fund, and  therefore, the larger the\n          Fund disbursements to Massachusetts producers\n          (but not to out-of-state producers).   Unless\n          remedied, the challenged pricing order event-\n          ually would lead  to the failure and  closure\n          of appellants' businesses.11\n\nD.   \"Imminence\" and \"Particularity\" of Economic Injury.\n                                                       \n\n          The  district  court correctly  noted  that appellants'\n\ncurrent  income and profits do not substantiate their allegations\n\nof economic  injury.  As  of the district court  dismissal order,\n\nappellants continued to sell their entire milk production to West\n\nLynn Creamery,  and neither the  volume nor the price  had abated\n\nsince the pricing order went into effect.

Once again,  we cannot\n\nagree.    Like  other  Massachusetts dealers  with  whom  it must\n\ncompete, West Lynn's self-interest (in lower transportation costs\n\nand reduced perishability) will be served by purchasing milk from\n\nnearby producers,  which at  least in many,  perhaps most,  cases\n\nwill be producers located in Massachusetts.  In that eventuality,\n\nthe out-of-state producers' current 97% share of West Lynn's milk\n\nbusiness would decline.   Nor is there anything  in the appellate\n\nrecord to  suggest that  West Lynn has  a non-economic  motive to\n                                                      \n\nspare these individual appellants at the expense of other out-of-\n\nstate producers.  Furthermore, even if the  alleged reductions in\n\nout-of-state  milk purchases were  minimal at the  outset, appel-\n\nlants would no  longer be able to  command as high a  premium for\n                                                             \n\ntheir milk,  because they would  then have to compete  with other\n\nout-of-state  producers  to  supply a  diminished  share  of West\n\n                                20\n\nLynn's import needs.  Finally,  as out-of-state milk is displaced\n\nin the Massachusetts marketplace  and \"overflows\" into interstate\n\ncommerce,  the federal  blend price  will  deflate, lowering  the\n\n\"safety  net\" for all  milk producers including  appellants.  For\n\nthese  reasons, we  cannot  agree with  the  conclusion that  the\n\nfederal \"blend\"  price insulates appellants  from all  cognizable\n\ninjury-in-fact, see supra pp. 8-9, or renders inconsequential all\n                         \n\nother  alleged injury-in-fact (e.g., loss of premium paid out-of-\n                                   \n\nstate producers prior to pricing order).  \n\n          Similarly, the Commissioner cannot carry the day on the\n\nclaim  that appellants' injury-in-fact is shared  with so large a\n\nclass (all out-of-state producers selling to  Massachusetts deal-\n\ners) that their respective shares of the aggregate injury will be\n\nminimal.  \"To  deny standing to  persons who are in  fact injured\n\nsimply because many others are  also injured, would mean that the\n\nmost injurious and  widespread Government actions could  be ques-\n\ntioned by  nobody.\"  SCRAP,  412 U.S. at  687; see also  AVX, 962\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 113 (\"While the requisite injury  may be common to many,\n\nit  may not be  shared by  all.\") (citations  omitted).   Even if\n\nappellants' market  \"displacement\" estimates  were grossly  exag-\n\ngerated,  a relatively small economic  loss    even an \"identifi-\n\nable trifle\"     is enough  to confer standing,  as it  affords a\n\nconstitutionally cognizable  stake  sufficient  to  ensure  their\n\nvigorous prosecution of the litigation.   See Rental Hous.

The meaning of the term \"immi-\n\nnent\"  depends on the particular circumstances, and in the highly\n\ncompetitive  environment  of  the  dairy  industry,  governmental\n\nactions often have intractable, long-term consequences.  Particu-\n\nlarly apt here is our earlier observation in Rental Housing:  \"it\n                                                           \n\ncould hardly be thought that  [State] action likely to cause harm\n\ncannot be  challenged until it is too late.\"  Rental Hous.

Although the \"emergency\" pricing order protect-\n\ned Massachusetts milk  producers from immediate erosion  of their\n\nremaining 10% share of  the Massachusetts milk market  by out-of-\n\nstate producers, an actual increase in Massachusetts milk produc-\n\ntion may take months or even years to materialize since it  would\n\ndepend upon long-term capital investments in dairy herd and  farm\n\nexpansions  and  infrastructure  improvements.    Once  realized,\n\nhowever, the  Massachusetts producers' newfound  competitive edge\n\nwould likely continue for an  extended period.

(suggesting that denial of motion to amend constitutes abuse of discretion \"if no justification appears\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second amended complaint, paraphrased, alleges that the following chain of economic events will result in appellants' loss of future income, profits, and business opportunities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>All milk currently produced by appellants is sold in the Massachusetts milk market in direct competition with Massachusetts milk producers.  As a direct consequence of the differential assessments Massachusetts milk dealers must pay into the Fund for each cwt purchased from producers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> consumer milk prices in Massachusetts will rise since dealers, in all likelihood, will pass along at least some portion of their increased costs to Massachusetts consumers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Consumer demand will decrease as prices increase.  In this shrinking market, Massachusetts dealers will continue to buy all available milk produced in Massachusetts, because of their \"preference \" for local supplies, due to the lower transportation costs and lesser producer-to-consumer delivery time (perishability being a major industry concern).  Higher milk prices and increased disbursements from the Fund will induce greater milk production by Massachusetts producers, thereby lowering the current 90% Massachusetts market share enjoyed by out-of-state producers.  Moreover, even if Massachusetts milk prices were to remain relatively stable, individual Massachusetts producers would have a strong incentive to increase production over their fellow home state dairy farmers, since Fund disbursements are based on each producer's relative share of overall Massachusetts milk production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>As Massachusetts producers increase their market share, out-of-state milk will be displaced, and \"overflow\" into interstate commerce.  These resulting surplus \"interstate\" supplies will deflate the federal \"blend\" or minimum price under Order No. 1.  Since appellants previously sold their entire milk production in Massachusetts, some of their out-of-state milk will be \"displaced\" by Massachusetts-produced milk.  As Massachusetts consumer demand decreases, out-of-state producers will no longer be able to command the same premium prices (in excess of the federal \"blend price\") received before the challenged pricing order.  See supra note 3.  Massachusetts producers will be insulated from any federal blend-price deflation, because, under the Fund's collection formula the greater the gap between $15 and the federal blend price, the larger the differential assessments Massachusetts dealers must pay into the Fund, and therefore, the larger the Fund disbursements to Massachusetts producers (but not to out-of-state producers).  Unless remedied, the challenged pricing order eventually would lead to the failure and closure of appellants' businesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>D. \"Imminence\" and \"Particularity\" of Economic Injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly noted that appellants' current income and profits do not substantiate their allegations of economic injury.  As of the district court dismissal order, appellants continued to sell their entire milk production to West Lynn Creamery, and neither the volume nor the price had abated since the pricing order went into effect.  For their part, appellees cite to several cases holding that the \"injury-in-fact\" requirement is satisfied at the pleading stage by allegations that the plaintiffs sustained actual financial loss, fairly traceable to the challenged regulation, between its effective date and the filing of the complaint.  See, e.g., Minnesota Milk Producers Ass'n v. Madigan, 956 F.2d 816, 818-19 (8th Cir.1992) (\"The producers have alleged that the provisions of the Secretary's orders directly cause a reduction in the price they receive for their milk.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at the pleading stage \"injury-in-fact\" need not entail currently realized economic loss, Article III standing in the commercial context must be premised, at a minimum, on particularized future economic injury which, though latent, nonetheless qualifies as \"imminent.\"   See Lujan, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2136.   Our review of the pertinent authorities satisfies us that the proposed second amended complaint alleges particularized future economic injury sufficient to support Article III standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rental Hous.  Ass'n of Greater Lynn v. Hills, 548 F.2d 388 (1st Cir.1977), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved funding to convert factories into housing for the elderly.  While the project was still in process, an association of local landlords brought suit in federal district court, complaining that the grant contravened Section 8 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and threatened \"competitive injury\" to the plaintiff association's members, who \"will lose tenants to the new project.\"  Id. at 389.   Finding the \"competitive injury\" allegations sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>While the [ ] project is not yet completed, and hence specific proof of competitive injury is not possible, it could hardly be thought that administrative action likely to cause harm cannot be challenged until it is too late.

(citation omitted) (emphasis added).  We noted that many cases uphold \"competitor standing\" based on \"unadorned allegations\" of latent economic injury.  Id. at 390;  see, e.g., Association of Data Processing Serv.  Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152, 154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970) (sellers of data processing services \"no doubt\" had standing to test ruling allowing national banks to sell data processing services;  injury-in-fact element met by allegations that competition from national banks \"might entail some future loss of profits\" and that respondent bank was preparing to perform data processing services for two of plaintiffs' customers);  Arnold Tours, Inc. v.

Inst. v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617, 620-21, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1093-94, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971) (finding \"competitor standing,\" on the part of investment companies, to test a regulatory ruling authorizing national banks to operate collective investment funds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposed second amended complaint meets the benchmark for \"competitor standing\" established by these authorities.  The Camp triad and Rental Housing cases are all premised on a plaintiff's status as a direct competitor whose position in the relevant marketplace would be affected adversely by the challenged governmental action.  Cf. Energy Transp. Group, Inc. v. Maritime Admin., 956 F.2d 1206, 1215 (D.C.Cir.1992) (finding that a disgruntled contract bidder, although generally engaged in the fuel transportation business, failed to allege sufficient \"competitive injury\" where it could not presently, or within prescribed future period, perform the particular types of services required by the contract at issue).  The Supreme Court found \"competitor standing\" in the Camp cases based on an alleged potential for heightened competition in a national marketplace.  Thus, arguably at least, the narrower the relevant marketplace, as in Rental Housing (municipality) and here (state), the greater the likelihood that a plaintiff will experience future economic loss as a consequence of the competitive advantage bestowed on its direct competitor.  In some \"direct competitor\" cases, future injury-in-fact is viewed as \"obvious\" since government action that removes or eases only the competitive burdens on the plaintiff's rivals plainly disadvantages the plaintiff's competitive position in the relevant marketplace.  However, \"[w]here 'injury' and 'cause' are not obvious, the plaintiff must plead their existence in his complaint with a fair degree of specificity.\"  Munoz-Mendoza, 711 F.2d at 425 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no question but that out-of-state milk producers are in direct competition with Massachusetts milk producers.  At the very least, out-of-state producers have to defend their current 90% share of the Massachusetts milk market and may even elect to compete with Massachusetts producers for the remaining 10% market share.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  If, as alleged, see supra pp. 919-920, Massachusetts producers were to realize sufficient infusions of capital to increase their milk production and their Massachusetts market share, it is \"obvious\" that appellants would sustain direct economic harm commensurate with the diminution of their current market share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, however, for discussion purposes, that the causal nexus between the challenged pricing order and appellants' alleged competitive injury is not sufficiently \"obvious,\" we are not persuaded by the Commissioner's contention that the sequence of economic events projected in the second amended complaint is too conclusory, speculative or attenuated.  See, e.g., United Transp. Union v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 891 F.2d 908, 912 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\"When considering any chain of allegations for standing purposes, we may reject as overly speculative ... predictions of future events (especially future actions by third parties )....\")  (emphasis added), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1024, 110 S.Ct. 3271, 111 L.Ed.2d 781 (1990).  In order to demonstrate \"standing,\" \"pleadings must be something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable\";  a plaintiff may not simply assert \"that he can imagine circumstances in which he could be affected by the agency's action.\"  SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 689, 93 S.Ct. at 2416.   The more remote in time the alleged injury-in-fact, the less obvious the \"concreteness of the controversy.\"   Thus, where the complaint relies only on prospective harm, it \" 'must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury.' \"  United Transp. Union, 891 F.2d at 913.   On the other hand, \"competitor standing\" cases necessarily turn on degrees of probability, see Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 884 F.2d 1462, 1465 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\"If an[ ] agency's act creates 'a substantial probability' of an 'injury in fact,' the causation requirement of Article III is satisfied.\")  (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. at 2208), a measurement \"not easily susceptible to concrete definitions or mechanical application,\" AVX, 962 F.2d at 113.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All predictions are conjectural to a degree.  Somewhere along the spectrum of probability, between tomorrow's sunrise and \"unadorned speculation,\" see, e.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 66, 106 S.Ct. 1697, 1705, 90 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986) (pediatrician's allegations of injury-in-fact based on assertion that aborted fetuses might otherwise have become fee-paying patients), lie appellants' allegations of \"imminent\" injury-in-fact based on the laws of economics.  Economics is a cross between an art and a science, which is to say, both an imperfect art and an imperfect science.  While the law of supply and demand may sometimes be suspended by unpredictable marketplace decisions, and even lesser fortuities like bovine obstinacy, basic economic theory quite consistently transcends utter randomness by positing elemental laws of cause and effect predicated on actual market experience and probable market behavior.  Indeed, most \"competitor standing\" cases depend on such core economic postulates.  See United Transp. Union, 891 F.2d at 913 (noting that in \"garden variety competitor standing cases,\" courts routinely credit causal connections \"firmly rooted in the basic laws of economics\" or \"basic economic logic\");  see also American Soc'y of Travel Agents, Inc. v. Blumenthal, 566 F.2d 145, 157 (D.C.Cir.1977) (\"[A]ll claims of competitive injury are to some extent speculative [and] predicated on the independent decisions of third parties, i.e. customers.  However, economics is the science of predicting these economic decisions....\")  (Bazelon, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1533, 55 L.Ed.2d 546 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rental Housing, we credited at face value an allegation that the plaintiff landlords, representing slightly more than one-third of the renters in the relevant housing market, would \"lose tenants\" to the HUD-subsidized project, even though their economic prediction plainly depended on the decisions of any number of independent parties--inter alia, elderly tenants seeking suitable housing, local zoning and planning boards, other federal and state agencies, and lending institutions--not to mention less predictable factors such as disasters, e.g., fire.  Two rational economic assumptions nonetheless combined to make it sufficiently \"probable\" that the landlords would sustain \"concrete\" future injury:  by increasing the volume of available housing in a defined market, both consumer demand and prices were likely to fall.  Similar economic principles impelled the Camp triad decisions on \"competitor standing.\"   See also supra note 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second amended complaint, much like that in Rental Housing, is based on standard principles of \"supply and demand\" routinely credited by courts in a variety of contexts.  See, e.g., Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 590, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1374, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983) (price or sales tax increase \"presumably will cause a decrease in demand\" for product) (citing Paul A. Samuelson, Economics 381-83, 389-90 (10th ed. 1976));  Competitive Enter.  Inst. v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 901 F.2d 107, 125 (D.C.Cir.1990) (\"Since the demand for a product is decreased as its price is increased....\");  Alcan Sales, Div. of Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. United States, 693 F.2d 1089, 1092 (Fed.Cir.1982) (nonrefundable federal surcharges are likely to be more effective in decreasing demand for imported goods because importers are more likely \"to pass along the cost of the surcharge through to consumers....\"), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 943, 103 S.Ct. 2119, 77 L.Ed.2d 1300 (1983).  In the present case, the more industry-specific allegations--such as Massachusetts dealers' preference for indigenous milk supplies--are confirmed by the affidavit of Dr. Ronald Knutson, a national expert in dairy industry economics, see supra pp. 919-920.  We conclude, therefore, that rather than \"empirically unverifiable\" conclusions, see Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16, the economic \"facts\" alleged in the proposed second amended complaint set forth adequate grounds to demonstrate, at the pleading stage, a sufficient likelihood that the challenged pricing order will result in reduced out-of-state milk sales to Massachusetts dealers at lower prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that out-of-state producers, as a class, might be injured under appellants' forecasts, the Commissioner contends that these individual appellants failed to demonstrate either injury-in-fact or that West Lynn Creamery will buy less than 100% of their milk production in the event Massachusetts production is increased in the future.  Once again, we cannot agree.  Like other Massachusetts dealers with whom it must compete, West Lynn's self-interest (in lower transportation costs and reduced perishability) will be served by purchasing milk from nearby producers, which at least in many, perhaps most, cases will be producers located in Massachusetts.  In that eventuality, the out-of-state producers' current 97% share of West Lynn's milk business would decline.  Nor is there anything in the appellate record to suggest that West Lynn has a non-economic motive to spare these individual appellants at the expense of other out-of-state producers.  Furthermore, even if the alleged reductions in out-of-state milk purchases were minimal at the outset, appellants would no longer be able to command as high a premium for their milk, because they would then have to compete with other out-of-state producers to supply a diminished share of West Lynn's import needs.  Finally, as out-of-state milk is displaced in the Massachusetts marketplace and \"overflows\" into interstate commerce, the federal blend price will deflate, lowering the \"safety net\" for all milk producers including appellants.  For these reasons, we cannot agree with the conclusion that the federal \"blend\" price insulates appellants from all cognizable injury-in-fact, see supra p. 919, or renders inconsequential all other alleged injury-in-fact (e.g., loss of premium paid out-of-state producers prior to pricing order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Commissioner cannot carry the day on the claim that appellants' injury-in-fact is shared with so large a class (all out-of-state producers selling to Massachusetts dealers) that their respective shares of the aggregate injury will be minimal.  \"To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread Government actions could be questioned by nobody.\"  SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 687, 93 S.Ct. at 2416;  see also AVX, 962 F.2d at 113 (\"While the requisite injury may be common to many, it may not be shared by all.\")  (citations omitted).  Even if appellants' market \"displacement\" estimates were grossly exaggerated, a relatively small economic loss--even an \"identifiable trifle\"--is enough to confer standing, as it affords a constitutionally cognizable stake sufficient to ensure their vigorous prosecution of the litigation.  See Rental Hous.  Ass'n, 548 F.2d at 389 (although plaintiffs collectively owned 7000 of 18,000 rental units in relevant marketplace, and HUD-subsidized competitor would develop only 183 units, \"the injury required for standing need not be substantial, it need only exist \") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the Commissioner sustain the dismissal on the ground that significant increases in Massachusetts milk production may be slow to materialize.  The meaning of the term \"imminent\" depends on the particular circumstances, and in the highly competitive environment of the dairy industry, governmental actions often have intractable, long-term consequences.  Particularly apt here is our earlier observation in Rental Housing:  \"it could hardly be thought that [State] action likely to cause harm cannot be challenged until it is too late.\"  Rental Hous.  Ass'n, 548 F.2d at 389.   Although the \"emergency\" pricing order protected Massachusetts milk producers from immediate erosion of their remaining 10% share of the Massachusetts milk market by out-of-state producers, an actual increase in Massachusetts milk production may take months or even years to materialize since it would depend upon long-term capital investments in dairy herd and farm expansions and infrastructure improvements.  Once realized, however, the Massachusetts producers' newfound competitive edge would likely continue for an extended period.  See, e.g., Sabine River Auth. v. United States Dep't of Interior, 951 F.2d 669, 675 (5th Cir.)  (plaintiff's challenge to government's acquisition of perpetual easement to wetlands area alleged sufficient non-speculative injury by projecting water shortage \"some forty years in the future\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 75, 121 L.Ed.2d 40 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We in no way suggest, of course, that the second amended complaint's portrayal of milk industry economics is beyond refutation either on summary judgment or at trial.  See SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 689, 93 S.Ct. at 2416 (where plaintiff alleges a \"perceptible harm,\" the defendant should move \"for summary judgment on the standing issue and demonstrate[ ] to the District Court that the allegations were sham....\") (emphasis added);  see also Bullfrog Films, Inc. v.

The monies in the Fund are distributed monthly among Massachusetts milk producers only, in direct proportion to their respective percentage of the total Massachusetts milk production, subject to a monthly payment cap to each Massachusetts producer equal to the differential assessment on 2000 cwt.

The court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>In complaining that the subsidy in itself injures out-of-state farmers, plaintiffs assume a perfectly competitive market in which a direct subsidy to local farmers results in their capture of a larger market share because they can offer their milk at a lower price.  Such analysis ignores the fact that there is [a] federal price support in effect.  Because the milk dealers must pay the federal minimum price to any dairy farmer, there is no incentive to purchase local rather than out-of-state milk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams, No. 92-11641-Z, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">390721</span></span>, at * 2 n. 4, 1992 U.S.Dist.

See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.1990).  Accordingly, setting to one side the first amended complaint, we inquire whether the second amended complaint alleged an actual or imminent \"injury-in-fact\" proximately caused by the challenged pricing order.  Id. (suggesting that denial of motion to amend constitutes abuse of discretion \"if no justification appears\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second amended complaint, paraphrased, alleges that the following chain of economic events will result in appellants' loss of future income, profits, and business opportunities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>All milk currently produced by appellants is sold in the Massachusetts milk market in direct competition with Massachusetts milk producers.  As a direct consequence of the differential assessments Massachusetts milk dealers must pay into the Fund for each cwt purchased from producers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> consumer milk prices in Massachusetts will rise since dealers, in all likelihood, will pass along at least some portion of their increased costs to Massachusetts consumers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Consumer demand will decrease as prices increase.  In this shrinking market, Massachusetts dealers will continue to buy all available milk produced in Massachusetts, because of their \"preference \" for local supplies, due to the lower transportation costs and lesser producer-to-consumer delivery time (perishability being a major industry concern).  Higher milk prices and increased disbursements from the Fund will induce greater milk production by Massachusetts producers, thereby lowering the current 90% Massachusetts market share enjoyed by out-of-state producers.  Moreover, even if Massachusetts milk prices were to remain relatively stable, individual Massachusetts producers would have a strong incentive to increase production over their fellow home state dairy farmers, since Fund disbursements are based on each producer's relative share of overall Massachusetts milk production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>As Massachusetts producers increase their market share, out-of-state milk will be displaced, and \"overflow\" into interstate commerce.  These resulting surplus \"interstate\" supplies will deflate the federal \"blend\" or minimum price under Order No. 1.  Since appellants previously sold their entire milk production in Massachusetts, some of their out-of-state milk will be \"displaced\" by Massachusetts-produced milk.  As Massachusetts consumer demand decreases, out-of-state producers will no longer be able to command the same premium prices (in excess of the federal \"blend price\") received before the challenged pricing order.  See supra note 3.  Massachusetts producers will be insulated from any federal blend-price deflation, because, under the Fund's collection formula the greater the gap between $15 and the federal blend price, the larger the differential assessments Massachusetts dealers must pay into the Fund, and therefore, the larger the Fund disbursements to Massachusetts producers (but not to out-of-state producers).  Unless remedied, the challenged pricing order eventually would lead to the failure and closure of appellants' businesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>D. \"Imminence\" and \"Particularity\" of Economic Injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly noted that appellants' current income and profits do not substantiate their allegations of economic injury.  As of the district court dismissal order, appellants continued to sell their entire milk production to West Lynn Creamery, and neither the volume nor the price had abated since the pricing order went into effect.  For their part, appellees cite to several cases holding that the \"injury-in-fact\" requirement is satisfied at the pleading stage by allegations that the plaintiffs sustained actual financial loss, fairly traceable to the challenged regulation, between its effective date and the filing of the complaint.

The Camp triad and Rental Housing cases are all premised on a plaintiff's status as a direct competitor whose position in the relevant marketplace would be affected adversely by the challenged governmental action.  Cf. Energy Transp. Group, Inc. v. Maritime Admin., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578158\"><a href=\"/opinion/578158/energy-transportation-group-inc-v-maritime-administration-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span>, 1215 (D.C.Cir.1992) (finding that a disgruntled contract bidder, although generally engaged in the fuel transportation business, failed to allege sufficient \"competitive injury\" where it could not presently, or within prescribed future period, perform the particular types of services required by the contract at issue).  The Supreme Court found \"competitor standing\" in the Camp cases based on an alleged potential for heightened competition in a national marketplace.  Thus, arguably at least, the narrower the relevant marketplace, as in Rental Housing (municipality) and here (state), the greater the likelihood that a plaintiff will experience future economic loss as a consequence of the competitive advantage bestowed on its direct competitor.  In some \"direct competitor\" cases, future injury-in-fact is viewed as \"obvious\" since government action that removes or eases only the competitive burdens on the plaintiff's rivals plainly disadvantages the plaintiff's competitive position in the relevant marketplace.  However, \"[w]here 'injury' and 'cause' are not obvious, the plaintiff must plead their existence in his complaint with a fair degree of specificity.\"  Munoz-Mendoza, 711 F.2d at 425 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no question but that out-of-state milk producers are in direct competition with Massachusetts milk producers.  At the very least, out-of-state producers have to defend their current 90% share of the Massachusetts milk market and may even elect to compete with Massachusetts producers for the remaining 10% market share.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  If, as alleged, see supra pp. 919-920, Massachusetts producers were to realize sufficient infusions of capital to increase their milk production and their Massachusetts market share, it is \"obvious\" that appellants would sustain direct economic harm commensurate with the diminution of their current market share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, however, for discussion purposes, that the causal nexus between the challenged pricing order and appellants' alleged competitive injury is not sufficiently \"obvious,\" we are not persuaded by the Commissioner's contention that the sequence of economic events projected in the second amended complaint is too conclusory, speculative or attenuated.  See, e.g., United Transp. Union v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533772\"><a href=\"/opinion/533772/united-transportation-union-v-interstate-commerce-commission-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 912 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\"When considering any chain of allegations for standing purposes, we may reject as overly speculative ... predictions of future events (especially future actions by third parties )....\")  (emphasis added), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Economics is a cross between an art and a science, which is to say, both an imperfect art and an imperfect science.  While the law of supply and demand may sometimes be suspended by unpredictable marketplace decisions, and even lesser fortuities like bovine obstinacy, basic economic theory quite consistently transcends utter randomness by positing elemental laws of cause and effect predicated on actual market experience and probable market behavior.  Indeed, most \"competitor standing\" cases depend on such core economic postulates.  See United Transp.

We conclude, therefore, that rather than \"empirically unverifiable\" conclusions, see Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16, the economic \"facts\" alleged in the proposed second amended complaint set forth adequate grounds to demonstrate, at the pleading stage, a sufficient likelihood that the challenged pricing order will result in reduced out-of-state milk sales to Massachusetts dealers at lower prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that out-of-state producers, as a class, might be injured under appellants' forecasts, the Commissioner contends that these individual appellants failed to demonstrate either injury-in-fact or that West Lynn Creamery will buy less than 100% of their milk production in the event Massachusetts production is increased in the future.  Once again, we cannot agree.  Like other Massachusetts dealers with whom it must compete, West Lynn's self-interest (in lower transportation costs and reduced perishability) will be served by purchasing milk from nearby producers, which at least in many, perhaps most, cases will be producers located in Massachusetts.  In that eventuality, the out-of-state producers' current 97% share of West Lynn's milk business would decline.  Nor is there anything in the appellate record to suggest that West Lynn has a non-economic motive to spare these individual appellants at the expense of other out-of-state producers.  Furthermore, even if the alleged reductions in out-of-state milk purchases were minimal at the outset, appellants would no longer be able to command as high a premium for their milk, because they would then have to compete with other out-of-state producers to supply a diminished share of West Lynn's import needs.  Finally, as out-of-state milk is displaced in the Massachusetts marketplace and \"overflows\" into interstate commerce, the federal blend price will deflate, lowering the \"safety net\" for all milk producers including appellants.  For these reasons, we cannot agree with the conclusion that the federal \"blend\" price insulates appellants from all cognizable injury-in-fact, see supra p. 919, or renders inconsequential all other alleged injury-in-fact (e.g., loss of premium paid out-of-state producers prior to pricing order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Commissioner cannot carry the day on the claim that appellants' injury-in-fact is shared with so large a class (all out-of-state producers selling to Massachusetts dealers) that their respective shares of the aggregate injury will be minimal.  \"To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread Government actions could be questioned by nobody.\"  SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 687, 93 S.Ct. at 2416;  see also AVX, 962 F.2d at 113 (\"While the requisite injury may be common to many, it may not be shared by all.\")  (citations omitted).  Even if appellants' market \"displacement\" estimates were grossly exaggerated, a relatively small economic loss--even an \"identifiable trifle\"--is enough to confer standing, as it affords a constitutionally cognizable stake sufficient to ensure their vigorous prosecution of the litigation.  See Rental Hous.  Ass'n, 548 F.2d at 389 (although plaintiffs collectively owned 7000 of 18,000 rental units in relevant marketplace, and HUD-subsidized competitor would develop only 183 units, \"the injury required for standing need not be substantial, it need only exist \") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the Commissioner sustain the dismissal on the ground that significant increases in Massachusetts milk production may be slow to materialize.  The meaning of the term \"imminent\" depends on the particular circumstances, and in the highly competitive environment of the dairy industry, governmental actions often have intractable, long-term consequences.  Particularly apt here is our earlier observation in Rental Housing:  \"it could hardly be thought that [State] action likely to cause harm cannot be challenged until it is too late.\"  Rental Hous.  Ass'n, 548 F.2d at 389.   Although the \"emergency\" pricing order protected Massachusetts milk producers from immediate erosion of their remaining 10% share of the Massachusetts milk market by out-of-state producers, an actual increase in Massachusetts milk production may take months or even years to materialize since it would depend upon long-term capital investments in dairy herd and farm expansions and infrastructure improvements.  Once realized, however, the Massachusetts producers' newfound competitive edge would likely continue for an extended period.  See, e.g., Sabine River Auth. v.

Even assuming that this omission undermines their claimed \"injury-in-fact\" with respect to the 10% share, there is no requirement that a plaintiff plead multiple forms of future injury-in-fact</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We think appellants were entitled, at the pleading stage, to presume that the milk industry would be subject to the basic economic laws at work in other competitive markets.  See supra p. 919:</p>\n        <p>The Supreme Court [in Camp] did not ... require plaintiffs to allege in their complaint facts sufficient to refute every possible anomaly of the marketplace such as the existence of voluntary labor or ideologically committed consumers.  The Court assumed the marketplace would function in a normal, predictable fashion, for to assume otherwise would be to foreclose the very possibility of ever satisfactorily alleging a competitive injury.</p>\n        <p>American Soc'y, 566 F.2d at 158 (emphasis added).  We nonetheless recognize, of course, as did the district court, that the milk industry is subject to federal marketing orders.  Consequently, where such economic anomalies are material, they may be tested at summary judgment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> We take no position respecting the merits of the Commerce Clause challenge, which implicates questions of interstate commerce \"burdens\" analytically distinct from the \"injury-in-fact\" determination that is central to standing.  As noted above, the Supreme Court has decided to review the underlying Commerce Clause claim.  See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.
