This  case  presents a  novel\n                            \n\ndispute  in  which  jurisdictional  and  merits   issues  are\n\nentangled  with a  question  of decree  interpretation.   The\n\ncourse of the litigation, which must be traced in some detail\n\nin order to  understand the issues, may  also be unique.   We\n\ncertainly hope  so and  regret that this  litigation, already\n\nprolonged by the parties' antics, requires one more round.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  April 1988, Joanna  Dimarco Zappa (\"Dimarco\") joined\n\nas co-plaintiff in a pending civil lawsuit brought by another\n\nindividual against members of the Real Estate Examining Board\n\nin  Puerto  Rico  (\"the  Board\").1   The  Board  had  awarded\n\nDimarco a  failing grade in the examination  given on October\n\n31,  1987, for a real  estate broker license  in Puerto Rico.\n\nDimarco  contended that  the  examination had  been given  in\n\nEnglish  and Spanish and that the Board had followed a policy\n\nof   making  the   English   version,  which   Dimarco  took,\n\nsubstantially more difficult than the Spanish version.\n\n     The suit was  brought under  42 U.S.C.    1983, and  the\n\ncomplaint  (generously construed)  asserted that  the Board's\n\npolicy  and action  violated constitutional  guarantees.   At\n\nleast  by  implication, Dimarco  sought injunctive  relief to\n\n                    \n\n     1Neither of the  parties named in the  caption remain in\nthis case.   The original  plaintiff, John Harris,  is not  a\nparty to this appeal.  Similarly, the first  named defendant,\nHector Rivera  Cruz, the Secretary of  Justice, was dismissed\nfrom the suit.\n\n                             -2-\n\ncompel  issuance of  the  license, and  she expressly  sought\n\ndamages including compensation for  lost income in the amount\n\nof  $100,000 per year.   The complaint also  alleged that the\n\nBoard proposed  to give future examinations  only in Spanish,\n\nand Dimarco sought an  injunction to require that it  also be\n\ngiven in English.\n\n     After  a hearing  in July  1988, the  district  court in\n\nMarch  1989  issued a  preliminary  injunction  requiring the\n\nBoard  to continue  to offer  the examination in  English, as\n\nwell as Spanish,  and to  assure that the  two versions  were\n\nequivalent.  Harris v.  Rivera Cruz, 710 F. Supp.  29 (D.P.R.\n                                   \n\n1989).  The  Board appealed,  a cross appeal  was filed,  and\n\nboth appeals were later withdrawn.  The Board made  repeated,\n\nand sometimes frivolous, efforts to have the case dismissed.\n\n     In August  1989, after a pretrial  conference and waiver\n\nof jury trial  by both sides, the court ordered both sides to\n\nsubmit briefs and evidence concerning each plaintiff's actual\n\nperformance  on  the  October  31, 1987,  examination.    The\n\nplaintiffs  complied  in  September  1989.    Their  analysis\n\npurported to  show which questions differed  significantly in\n\nEnglish and  Spanish and how  the plaintiffs' own  grades had\n\nbeen  lowered by  mathematical errors;  specifically, certain\n\ntrue-false questions had been answered differently by the two\n\nplaintiffs  but  both  answers  had been  graded  as  wrongly\n                     \n\nanswered.  The Board submitted no analysis or rebuttal.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Then on March  19, 1990, the  parties attended a  status\n\nconference.   On  March 22,  1990, the  court entered  a one-\n\nparagraph \"status  conference order\" that  concluded with the\n\nfollowing   sentence:  \"The  parties  have  agreed  that  the\n\nexamination  will be  given  in English,  and  that the  only\n\nremaining issue is whether  the plaintiffs passed this exam.\"\n\nNothing  in the order refers  to Dimarco's damage  claim.  No\n\ntranscript  of the  conference has  been supplied,  and quite\n\npossibly no reporter was present.\n\n     Nothing more  occurred until November  1990 when Dimarco\n\nfiled a motion asking the court to enter judgment determining\n\nthat  Dimarco had passed the  examination with a  score of 97\n\npoints  out of 100.  The motion  argued that more than a year\n\nhad passed  since Dimarco's  evidence had  been filed  and no\n\nrebuttal had been  offered by the  Board.  The Board  did not\n\nrespond.   On April 23,  1991, the district  court entered an\n\norder determining that Dimarco had passed the examination and\n\ndirecting the Board to issue her a license.  The order stated\n\nthat \"because  both parties have previously  agreed that this\n\nwas the only issue remaining in the case, [j]udgment shall be\n\nentered accordingly.\"\n\n     On the same  day, the court  entered a \"Judgment\"  which\n\ndecreed  that   \"[j]udgment  be  entered  in   favor  of  the\n\nplaintiffs  . . . as both of these plaintiffs have passed the\n\nrealtor's examination\"  and \"ordered\"  that  the Board  issue\n\n                             -4-\n\nreal estate broker's licenses to the plaintiffs.  Once again,\n\nthere was  no reference to damages.  Nothing in the April 23,\n\n1991, order or the separate judgment stated that the judgment\n\nwas  final as  to all claims  or that  the case  was formally\n\ncomplete.  However, on May 2, 1991, Dimarco's counsel filed a\n\nmemorandum  seeking  costs, a  portion  of  which were  later\n\nawarded.\n\n     On  May 9, 1991,  the Board  filed a  motion purportedly\n\nunder  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) claiming that the injunction was\n\nimproper because other requisites,  apart from passage of the\n\nexamination,  had to be  satisfied before a  license could be\n\ngranted.   The Board  also asserted  that plaintiffs  had not\n\nexhausted their  administrative remedies.   The  court denied\n\nthe  motion  by  order filed  July  1,  1991;  it noted  that\n\nexhaustion was  not required in  section 1983 actions  and it\n\nobserved again the  parties had earlier agreed that \"the only\n\nremaining issue before the Court was the issue of whether the\n\nplaintiffs had passed this examination.\" \n\n     Instead of issuing a license, the Board then filed a new\n\nappeal to  this court,  which was later  withdrawn.   Dimarco\n\nfiled a motion to hold the Board in contempt.  The Board then\n\nissued  a license  to Dimarco  in August  1991 but  the Board\n\nnoted on the face of  the license that it was given  by court\n\norder.  Dimarco filed a new contempt motion in February 1992.\n\nIn  March 1992 the court ordered that an undefaced license be\n\n                             -5-\n\nissued.    Once  again the  Board  did  nothing until,  after\n\nanother contempt motion and  an order to show cause  from the\n\ncourt,  a clean  license  was finally  issued  to Dimarco  in\n\nAugust 1992.  \n\n     On January 5,  1993, Dimarco requested a  date for trial\n\non the  issue of damages.   The court clerk set  a trial date\n\nbut  the Board asked the court to reconsider, arguing that in\n\nthe March  19, 1990,  status conference, \"the  parties agreed\n\nthat the examinations at issue in this case would be given in\n\nEnglish and that  the only  remaining issue in  the case  was\n\nwhether  the  plaintiffs  had  passed the  exams.\"    Dimarco\n\nresponded opaquely  that damages had been  requested from the\n\noutset and  had never been adjudicated by the court.  After a\n\nstatus  conference, the  court on  May 12,  1993, entered  an\n\norder, which says in part:\n\n          The  Court  [in  the  May  11,   1993,  status\n     conference] clarified  with the parties  that since\n     Judgment  was  entered  in  this case  based  on  a\n     settlement   between   the  parties,   without  the\n     imposition of damages, and the plaintiffs failed to\n     appeal  the Judgment,  this  case is  closed.   The\n     plaintiffs'  attempt to  recover  damages  at  this\n     juncture in the litigation is extremely belated and\n     therefore unavailing.\n\n     Dimarco has  now appealed from  the May 12,  1993, order\n\nand requested that we reverse the district court and direct a\n\ntrial on  damages.   Dimarco's brief, without  discussing the\n\nMarch  19, 1990,  conference,  argues that  her damage  claim\n\ncannot  have  been abandoned  since  Dimarco  was never  paid\n\n                             -6-\n\nanything in settlement  and that such  a payment is  required\n\nunder Puerto Rican  law in  order to compromise  a law  suit.\n\nDimarco also asserts  that nothing shows that  the court ever\n\nconsolidated the injunction and damage phases of the case.\n\n     In  response, the  Board  argues that  this court  lacks\n\njurisdiction  over the appeal.2  Its theory is that the April\n\n23, 1991, order and judgment \"finally decided the case\"; that\n\nno appeal was lodged by Dimarco until two years later in June\n\n1993;  and that this  two year interval  is long  past the 30\n\ndays allowed for appealing a final judgment.  Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(1).  Like Dimarco,  the Board's brief casts no  light on\n\nwhat  actually  happened  at   the  March  19,  1990,  status\n\nconference.\n\n                             II.\n\n     We  think  that   this  appeal   presents  two   related\n\nquestions:  one  is whether  Dimarco  waived  or settled  her\n\ndamage claim on  or about March  19, 1990;  and the other  is\n\nwhether, even  if she retained  her damage claim  after March\n\n19, 1990, her rights  were cut off by  failing to appeal  the\n\njudgment entered on April  23, 1991.  We consider  the issues\n\nin that order.\n\n                    \n\n     2We  clearly have  jurisdiction  to review  the May  12,\n1993,  order  inasmuch  as it  is  itself  final  (no further\nproceedings being  contemplated), and  an appeal from  it was\nfiled  within the prescribed period.   But we  agree with the\nBoard that, if the April 25, 1991, order were itself  a final\ndisposition of the entire  case, it would be too  late now to\nresurrect the damage claim.  This issue is addressed below.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     1.   On  this  record it  is  not possible  to tell  for\n\ncertain whether  Dimarco's claim  for damages was  settled or\n\nwaived on  March 19,  1990, but  it is  possible to  say with\n\nassurance  that  the  record  does  not  demonstrate  such  a\n\nsettlement  or waiver.  One might expect that, if a plaintiff\n\nhad  agreed to  forego  a  damage  claim  set  forth  in  the\n\ncomplaint,  this  would  be  embodied  in  a  stipulation  or\n\nevidenced by  a  transcript statement  of counsel.   No  such\n\ndocument or  transcript reference has been  supplied or cited\n\nto us by  the Board.3   Indeed, in this  instance we are  not\n\neven  offered any  plausible  reason why  Dimarco might  have\n\nwished to surrender her damage claim on March 19, 1990.  \n\n     The  statement in  the March 22,  1990, order  that \"the\n\nonly remaining  issue is  whether the plaintiffs  passed this\n\nexam\" is  quite ambiguous.   It was made  at a time  when the\n\nfocus of the litigation  was on injunctive relief.   Both the\n\nexistence and the amount  of damages could not even  begin to\n\nbe determined until the court decided whether the license had\n\nbeen  wrongfully denied and when  it should be  issued.  That\n\n                    \n\n     3Dimarco  asserts that  the  claim could  not have  been\nrelinquished  under  Puerto  Rico  law  since  there  was  no\npayment.  Whatever Puerto Rico law may say about out of court\nsettlements,  every litigator  knows that--in  the  course of\nconferences with the  judge as  a case  moves toward  trial--\ncomplaints are narrowed by agreement and claims are abandoned\nwithout any payment.   The question is whether  that happened\nhere.\n\n                             -8-\n\norder  itself does not speak  of waiver or  settlement of the\n\ndamage claim.  \n\n     In its May 12, 1993,  order, the district court refers--\n\nseemingly for  the  first  time--to  an  earlier  \"settlement\n\nbetween  the  parties,  without the  imposition  of damages.\"\n\nThis  language may be nothing more  than the district court's\n\ngloss  on its earlier March 22, 1990,  order.  But even if it\n\nis treated as a  factual finding that Dimarco did  settle her\n\ndamage claim  on March 19, 1990, the \"finding\" cannot resolve\n\nthis case.  Such a finding would still have to rest upon some\n\nevidence,  and  on  this record  we  have  no  evidence of  a\n                                             \n\nsettlement. \n\n     Finally,  in an  ordinary case the  failure to  pursue a\n\ndamage claim for two  years after the definitive injunction--\n\nhere,  from April 23, 1991, to January 5, 1993--might be some\n\nevidence of an earlier waiver or settlement or even support a\n\ndismissal  for non-prosecution.    Here, however,  instead of\n\ncomplying with the  injunction, the Board  improperly delayed\n\nissuance  of  an adequate  license until  August 1992.   That\n\nDimarco waited  four more  months before asking  for a  trial\n\ndate does not count for much in a five-year-old case.\n\n     2.   Although we cannot  find a waiver  or settlement on\n\nthis record,  the possibility  remains that Dimarco  lost her\n\nunsettled,  unwaived damage  claim  because of  the  judgment\n\nentered on  April 23, 1991, granting  a permanent injunction.\n\n                             -9-\n\nIf that  judgment constituted  a final judgment  disposing of\n\nthe entire case,  then the  failure of Dimarco  to pursue  an\n\nappeal  within the  prescribed  30-day period  would end  the\n\ncase.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1).  Such a  final judgment might\n\nstill  be  reopened by  post-judgment  motion;  but the  most\n\nfamiliar grounds  (e.g., excusable neglect) require  a motion\n                       \n\nwithin one year of the judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).\n\n     For purposes of \"terminat[ing] the  action\" and starting\n\nthe appeal clock on the entire case, a  judgment is not final\n\nif it \"adjudicates fewer  than all the claims\" asserted  by a\n\nparty.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).   We have already seen that in\n\nthis case  the judgment  did not  actually adjudicate  all of\n\nDimarco's claims since, so far as the record reveals, Dimarco\n\nstill retained in April 1991 a damage claim that had not been\n\nwaived or  settled or tried.   Thus  sub specie  aeternitatis\n\nthere was on  April 23, 1991, an appealable judgment (because\n\nof the injunction) but not a final judgment.4 \n\n     In  our view,  the  Board  could  still  rely  upon  the\n\njudgment  as final if it had at  least purported to be final.\n                                                \n\nThus,  if  the  April   23,  1991,  judgment  had  explicitly\n\nterminated the entire  case, we would treat  that judgment as\n\n                    \n\n     4The terminology can be confusing because a judgment may\nbe appealable  at once  even though  not  \"final\" within  the\nmeaning of Rule  54(b).   See, e.g., 28  U.S.C.    1292(a)(1)\n                                   \n(injunctions).   Yet because  such situations are exceptions,\nit is commonplace  to use  the phrase \"final  judgment\" as  a\nsynonym for  \"appealable judgment,\" even  though the concepts\nare not identical.\n\n                             -10-\n\nfinal, so far as a later attack upon it or attempt to undo it\n\nis concerned.   The point is that a judgment purporting to be\n\nfinal  moves the case toward  repose.  If  errors remain, the\n\nproper  course for an aggrieved litigant is to appeal, and to\n\ndo so within the time allowed.\n\n     Yet  in this instance the April  23, 1991, judgment does\n\nnot on its  face say anything to indicate  either that it was\n\nresolving the damage claim or  that it intended to  terminate\n\nthe  entire  case.   A judgment  unambiguous  on its  face is\n\nconstrued as a writing  without resort to extrinsic evidence;\n\ngiven  doubt,  resort may  be had  to  other orders  or other\n\nevidence ascertainable from  the record.5  In  this case, the\n\nApril 23, 1991, order accompanying the judgment refers to the\n\nfinding that Dimarco had  passed the exam as \"the  only issue\n\nremaining in  the case.\"   The quoted  statement should  have\n\nalerted  a  careful  lawyer   to  the  possibility  that  the\n\naccompanying  judgment--although   not  labeled  \"final\"--was\n\nintended to dispose of all claims.\n\n     But if resort to the accompanying order helps the Board,\n\nthe record  in other  respects assists Dimarco.   The  damage\n\nclaim  had been asserted and never resolved.  Nor was it ripe\n\nfor  resolution in April 1991 since no license had issued and\n\nthus  there was no end point for calculating any damages that\n\n                    \n\n     5E.g., Security Mutual Cas. Co. v. Century Cas. Co., 621\n                                                       \nF.2d  1062 (10th  Cir. 1980);  Eaton  v. Courtaulds  of North\n                                                             \nAmerica, 578 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1978).\n       \n\n                             -11-\n\nmight be  due.  All of  the attention of the  parties to that\n\npoint  had  been  centered  upon  injunctive  relief  of  two\n\ndifferent types, and only  injunctive relief was mentioned in\n\nthe judgment.  The same judgment could have been entered even\n\nif  the  court  intended to  start  a  trial  on damages  the\n\nfollowing day.    We  think,  therefore, that  a  measure  of\n\nuncertainty remains.\n\n     There is no  precise formula  for construing  judgments.\n\nBut  we are reluctant to construe a judgment ambiguous on its\n\nface  as a final judgment where it could plausibly be read as\n\nnon-final, where extrinsic  evidence does not  wholly resolve\n\nthe uncertainty, and where reading it as final could unfairly\n\nforfeit  the rights  of  a party.

Dimarco contended that the examination had been given in English and Spanish and that the Board had followed a policy of making the English version, which Dimarco took, substantially more difficult than the Spanish version.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, and the complaint (generously construed) asserted that the Board's policy and action violated constitutional guarantees.  At least by implication, Dimarco sought injunctive relief to compel issuance of the license, and she expressly sought damages including compensation for lost income in the amount of $100,000 per year.  The complaint also alleged that the Board proposed to give future examinations only in Spanish, and Dimarco sought an injunction to require that it also be given in English.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing in July 1988, the district court in March 1989 issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Board to continue to offer the examination in English, as well as Spanish, and to assure that the two versions were equivalent.  Harris v. Rivera Cruz, 710 F.Supp. 29 (D.P.R.1989).  The Board appealed, a cross appeal was filed, and both appeals were later withdrawn.  The Board made repeated, and sometimes frivolous, efforts to have the case dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1989, after a pretrial conference and waiver of jury trial by both sides, the court ordered both sides to submit briefs and evidence concerning each plaintiff's actual performance on the October 31, 1987, examination.  The plaintiffs complied in September 1989.  Their analysis purported to show which questions differed significantly in English and Spanish and how the plaintiffs' own grades had been lowered by mathematical errors;  specifically, certain true-false questions had been answered differently by the two plaintiffs but both answers had been graded as wrongly answered.  The Board submitted no analysis or rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then on March 19, 1990, the parties attended a status conference.  On March 22, 1990, the court entered a one-paragraph \"status conference order\" that concluded with the following sentence:  \"The parties have agreed that the examination will be given in English, and that the only remaining issue is whether the plaintiffs passed this exam.\"   Nothing in the order refers to Dimarco's damage claim.  No transcript of the conference has been supplied, and quite possibly no reporter was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing more occurred until November 1990 when Dimarco filed a motion asking the court to enter judgment determining that Dimarco had passed the examination with a score of 97 points out of 100.  The motion argued that more than a year had passed since Dimarco's evidence had been filed and no rebuttal had been offered by the Board.  The Board did not respond.  On April 23, 1991, the district court entered an order determining that Dimarco had passed the examination and directing the Board to issue her a license.  The order stated that \"because both parties have previously agreed that this was the only issue remaining in the case, [j]udgment shall be entered accordingly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the court entered a \"Judgment\" which decreed that \"[j]udgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs ... as both of these plaintiffs have passed the realtor's examination\" and \"ordered\" that the Board issue real estate broker's licenses to the plaintiffs.  Once again, there was no reference to damages.  Nothing in the April 23, 1991, order or the separate judgment stated that the judgment was final as to all claims or that the case was formally complete.  However, on May 2, 1991, Dimarco's counsel filed a memorandum seeking costs, a portion of which were later awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 1991, the Board filed a motion purportedly under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) claiming that the injunction was improper because other requisites, apart from passage of the examination, had to be satisfied before a license could be granted.  The Board also asserted that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.  The court denied the motion by order filed July 1, 1991;  it noted that exhaustion was not required in section 1983 actions and it observed again the parties had earlier agreed that \"the only remaining issue before the Court was the issue of whether the plaintiffs had passed this examination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of issuing a license, the Board then filed a new appeal to this court, which was later withdrawn.  Dimarco filed a motion to hold the Board in contempt.  The Board then issued a license to Dimarco in August 1991 but the Board noted on the face of the license that it was given by court order.  Dimarco filed a new contempt motion in February 1992.  In March 1992 the court ordered that an undefaced license be issued.  Once again the Board did nothing until, after another contempt motion and an order to show cause from the court, a clean license was finally issued to Dimarco in August 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1993, Dimarco requested a date for trial on the issue of damages.  The court clerk set a trial date but the Board asked the court to reconsider, arguing that in the March 19, 1990, status conference, \"the parties agreed that the examinations at issue in this case would be given in English and that the only remaining issue in the case was whether the plaintiffs had passed the exams.\"   Dimarco responded opaquely that damages had been requested from the outset and had never been adjudicated by the court.  After a status conference, the court on May 12, 1993, entered an order, which says in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court [in the May 11, 1993, status conference] clarified with the parties that since Judgment was entered in this case based on a settlement between the parties, without the imposition of damages, and the plaintiffs failed to appeal the Judgment, this case is closed.  The plaintiffs' attempt to recover damages at this juncture in the litigation is extremely belated and therefore unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dimarco has now appealed from the May 12, 1993, order and requested that we reverse the district court and direct a trial on damages.  Dimarco's brief, without discussing the March 19, 1990, conference, argues that her damage claim cannot have been abandoned since Dimarco was never paid anything in settlement and that such a payment is required under Puerto Rican law in order to compromise a law suit.  Dimarco also asserts that nothing shows that the court ever consolidated the injunction and damage phases of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the Board argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Its theory is that the April 23, 1991 order and judgment \"finally decided the case\";  that no appeal was lodged by Dimarco until two years later in June 1993;  and that this two year interval is long past the 30 days allowed for appealing a final judgment.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).  Like Dimarco, the Board's brief casts no light on what actually happened at the March 19, 1990, status conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this appeal presents two related questions:  one is whether Dimarco waived or settled her damage claim on or about March 19, 1990;  and the other is whether, even if she retained her damage claim after March 19, 1990, her rights were cut off by failing to appeal the judgment entered on April 23, 1991.  We consider the issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. On this record it is not possible to tell for certain whether Dimarco's claim for damages was settled or waived on March 19, 1990, but it is possible to say with assurance that the record does not demonstrate such a settlement or waiver.  One might expect that, if a plaintiff had agreed to forego a damage claim set forth in the complaint, this would be embodied in a stipulation or evidenced by a transcript statement of counsel.  No such document or transcript reference has been supplied or cited to us by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Indeed, in this instance we are not even offered any plausible reason why Dimarco might have wished to surrender her damage claim on March 19, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in the March 22, 1990, order that \"the only remaining issue is whether the plaintiffs passed this exam\" is quite ambiguous.  It was made at a time when the focus of the litigation was on injunctive relief.  Both the existence and the amount of damages could not even begin to be determined until the court decided whether the license had been wrongfully denied and when it should be issued.  That order itself does not speak of waiver or settlement of the damage claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its May 12, 1993, order, the district court refers--seemingly for the first time--to an earlier \"settlement between the parties, without the imposition of damages.\"   This language may be nothing more than the district court's gloss on its earlier March 22, 1990, order.  But even if it is treated as a factual finding that Dimarco did settle her damage claim on March 19, 1990, the \"finding\" cannot resolve this case.  Such a finding would still have to rest upon some evidence, and on this record we have no evidence of a settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in an ordinary case the failure to pursue a damage claim for two years after the definitive injunction--here, from April 23, 1991, to January 5, 1993--might be some evidence of an earlier waiver or settlement or even support a dismissal for non-prosecution.  Here, however, instead of complying with the injunction, the Board improperly delayed issuance of an adequate license until August 1992.  That Dimarco waited four more months before asking for a trial date does not count for much in a five-year-old case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Although we cannot find a waiver or settlement on this record, the possibility remains that Dimarco lost her unsettled, unwaived damage claim because of the judgment entered on April 23, 1991, granting a permanent injunction.  If that judgment constituted a final judgment disposing of the entire case, then the failure of Dimarco to pursue an appeal within the prescribed 30-day period would end the case.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).  Such a final judgment might still be reopened by post-judgment motion;  but the most familiar grounds (e.g., excusable neglect) require a motion within one year of the judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of \"terminat[ing] the action\" and starting the appeal clock on the entire case, a judgment is not final if it \"adjudicates fewer than all the claims\" asserted by a party.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).  We have already seen that in this case the judgment did not actually adjudicate all of Dimarco's claims since, so far as the record reveals, Dimarco still retained in April 1991 a damage claim that had not been waived or settled or tried.  Thus, sub specie aeternitatis there was on April 23, 1991, an appealable judgment (because of the injunction) but not a final judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Board could still rely upon the judgment as final if it had at least purported to be final.  Thus, if the April 23, 1991, judgment had explicitly terminated the entire case, we would treat that judgment as final, so far as a later attack upon it or attempt to undo it is concerned.  The point is that a judgment purporting to be final moves the case toward repose.  If errors remain, the proper course for an aggrieved litigant is to appeal, and to do so within the time allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in this instance the April 23, 1991, judgment does not on its face say anything to indicate either that it was resolving the damage claim or that it intended to terminate the entire case.  A judgment unambiguous on its face is construed as a writing without resort to extrinsic evidence;  given doubt, resort may be had to other orders or other evidence ascertainable from the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In this case, the April 23, 1991, order accompanying the judgment refers to the finding that Dimarco had passed the exam as \"the only issue remaining in the case.\"   The quoted statement should have alerted a careful lawyer to the possibility that the accompanying judgment--although not labeled \"final\"--was intended to dispose of all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if resort to the accompanying order helps the Board, the record in other respects assists Dimarco.  The damage claim had been asserted and never resolved.  Nor was it ripe for resolution in April 1991 since no license had issued and thus there was no end point for calculating any damages that might be due.  All of the attention of the parties to that point had been centered upon injunctive relief of two different types, and only injunctive relief was mentioned in the judgment.  The same judgment could have been entered even if the court intended to start a trial on damages the following day.  We think, therefore, that a measure of uncertainty remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no precise formula for construing judgments.  But we are reluctant to construe a judgment ambiguous on its face as a final judgment where it could plausibly be read as non-final, where extrinsic evidence does not wholly resolve the uncertainty, and where reading it as final could unfairly forfeit the rights of a party.  Here the facts already described leave us in doubt whether the judgment can fairly be construed as final;  there is a patent risk of unfairness to Dimarco;  and the Board is not unfairly prejudiced by reading the judgment to leave standing any damage claim that Dimarco did not previously waive or settle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains to consider the course to be followed on remand.  For reasons already explained, this record does not establish that Dimarco has waived or settled her damage claim.  Still, in view of the failure of anyone to disclose on appeal what happened on March 19, 1990, we think that justice requires that we not foreclose the Board on remand from offering evidence, if it has any, to establish that Dimarco did specifically waive or settle her damage claim at the March 19, 1990, conference.  The Board bears the burden of proving such a waiver or settlement.  Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we speak of the Board offering evidence, we are referring to any new evidence that shows that Dimarco on or about March 19, 1990, settled the damage claim or expressed an intention to waive it.  If the Board does have any evidence to offer, obviously Dimarco may respond to it, and the district court can then make findings to resolve the issue.  If no evidence is offered by the Board, then the court should proceed with the damage claim.  Whether the defendants are liable for damages is, of course, a matter on which we express no views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of May 12, 1993, is vacated as to Dimarco and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither of the parties named in the caption remain in this case.  The original plaintiff, John Harris, is not a party to this appeal.  Similarly, the first named defendant, Hector Rivera Cruz, the Secretary of Justice, was dismissed from the suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We clearly have jurisdiction to review the May 12, 1993, order inasmuch as it is itself final (no further proceedings being contemplated), and an appeal from it was filed within the prescribed period.  But we agree with the Board that, if the April 23, 1991, order were itself a final disposition of the entire case, it would be too late now to resurrect the damage claim.  This issue is addressed below</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Dimarco asserts that the claim could not have been relinquished under Puerto Rico law since there was no payment.  Whatever Puerto Rico law may say about out of court settlements, every litigator knows that--in the course of conferences with the judge as a case moves toward trial--complaints are narrowed by agreement and claims are abandoned without any payment.  The question is whether that happened here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The terminology can be confusing because a judgment may be appealable at once even though not \"final\" within the meaning of Rule 54(b).  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) (injunctions).  Yet because such situations are exceptions, it is commonplace to use the phrase \"final judgment\" as a synonym for \"appealable judgment,\" even though the concepts are not identical</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> E.g., Security Mutual Cas.

Harris v. Rivera Cruz, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span> (D.P.R.1989).  The Board appealed, a cross appeal was filed, and both appeals were later withdrawn.  The Board made repeated, and sometimes frivolous, efforts to have the case dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1989, after a pretrial conference and waiver of jury trial by both sides, the court ordered both sides to submit briefs and evidence concerning each plaintiff's actual performance on the October 31, 1987, examination.  The plaintiffs complied in September 1989.  Their analysis purported to show which questions differed significantly in English and Spanish and how the plaintiffs' own grades had been lowered by mathematical errors;  specifically, certain true-false questions had been answered differently by the two plaintiffs but both answers had been graded as wrongly answered.  The Board submitted no analysis or rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then on March 19, 1990, the parties attended a status conference.  On March 22, 1990, the court entered a one-paragraph \"status conference order\" that concluded with the following sentence:  \"The parties have agreed that the examination will be given in English, and that the only remaining issue is whether the plaintiffs passed this exam.\"   Nothing in the order refers to Dimarco's damage claim.  No transcript of the conference has been supplied, and quite possibly no reporter was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing more occurred until November 1990 when Dimarco filed a motion asking the court to enter judgment determining that Dimarco had passed the examination with a score of 97 points out of 100.  The motion argued that more than a year had passed since Dimarco's evidence had been filed and no rebuttal had been offered by the Board.  The Board did not respond.  On April 23, 1991, the district court entered an order determining that Dimarco had passed the examination and directing the Board to issue her a license.  The order stated that \"because both parties have previously agreed that this was the only issue remaining in the case, [j]udgment shall be entered accordingly.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the court entered a \"Judgment\" which decreed that \"[j]udgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs ... as both of these plaintiffs have passed the realtor's examination\" and \"ordered\" that the Board issue real estate broker's licenses to the plaintiffs.  Once again, there was no reference to damages.  Nothing in the April 23, 1991, order or the separate judgment stated that the judgment was final as to all claims or that the case was formally complete.  However, on May 2, 1991, Dimarco's counsel filed a memorandum seeking costs, a portion of which were later awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 1991, the Board filed a motion purportedly under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) claiming that the injunction was improper because other requisites, apart from passage of the examination, had to be satisfied before a license could be granted.  The Board also asserted that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.  The court denied the motion by order filed July 1, 1991;  it noted that exhaustion was not required in section 1983 actions and it observed again the parties had earlier agreed that \"the only remaining issue before the Court was the issue of whether the plaintiffs had passed this examination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of issuing a license, the Board then filed a new appeal to this court, which was later withdrawn.  Dimarco filed a motion to hold the Board in contempt.  The Board then issued a license to Dimarco in August 1991 but the Board noted on the face of the license that it was given by court order.  Dimarco filed a new contempt motion in February 1992.  In March 1992 the court ordered that an undefaced license be issued.  Once again the Board did nothing until, after another contempt motion and an order to show cause from the court, a clean license was finally issued to Dimarco in August 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1993, Dimarco requested a date for trial on the issue of damages.  The court clerk set a trial date but the Board asked the court to reconsider, arguing that in the March 19, 1990, status conference, \"the parties agreed that the examinations at issue in this case would be given in English and that the only remaining issue in the case was whether the plaintiffs had passed the exams.\"   Dimarco responded opaquely that damages had been requested from the outset and had never been adjudicated by the court.  After a status conference, the court on May 12, 1993, entered an order, which says in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court [in the May 11, 1993, status conference] clarified with the parties that since Judgment was entered in this case based on a settlement between the parties, without the imposition of damages, and the plaintiffs failed to appeal the Judgment, this case is closed.  The plaintiffs' attempt to recover damages at this juncture in the litigation is extremely belated and therefore unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dimarco has now appealed from the May 12, 1993, order and requested that we reverse the district court and direct a trial on damages.  Dimarco's brief, without discussing the March 19, 1990, conference, argues that her damage claim cannot have been abandoned since Dimarco was never paid anything in settlement and that such a payment is required under Puerto Rican law in order to compromise a law suit.  Dimarco also asserts that nothing shows that the court ever consolidated the injunction and damage phases of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the Board argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Its theory is that the April 23, 1991 order and judgment \"finally decided the case\";  that no appeal was lodged by Dimarco until two years later in June 1993;  and that this two year interval is long past the 30 days allowed for appealing a final judgment.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).  Like Dimarco, the Board's brief casts no light on what actually happened at the March 19, 1990, status conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this appeal presents two related questions:  one is whether Dimarco waived or settled her damage claim on or about March 19, 1990;  and the other is whether, even if she retained her damage claim after March 19, 1990, her rights were cut off by failing to appeal the judgment entered on April 23, 1991.  We consider the issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. On this record it is not possible to tell for certain whether Dimarco's claim for damages was settled or waived on March 19, 1990, but it is possible to say with assurance that the record does not demonstrate such a settlement or waiver.  One might expect that, if a plaintiff had agreed to forego a damage claim set forth in the complaint, this would be embodied in a stipulation or evidenced by a transcript statement of counsel.  No such document or transcript reference has been supplied or cited to us by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Indeed, in this instance we are not even offered any plausible reason why Dimarco might have wished to surrender her damage claim on March 19, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in the March 22, 1990, order that \"the only remaining issue is whether the plaintiffs passed this exam\" is quite ambiguous.  It was made at a time when the focus of the litigation was on injunctive relief.  Both the existence and the amount of damages could not even begin to be determined until the court decided whether the license had been wrongfully denied and when it should be issued.  That order itself does not speak of waiver or settlement of the damage claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its May 12, 1993, order, the district court refers--seemingly for the first time--to an earlier \"settlement between the parties, without the imposition of damages.\"   This language may be nothing more than the district court's gloss on its earlier March 22, 1990, order.  But even if it is treated as a factual finding that Dimarco did settle her damage claim on March 19, 1990, the \"finding\" cannot resolve this case.  Such a finding would still have to rest upon some evidence, and on this record we have no evidence of a settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in an ordinary case the failure to pursue a damage claim for two years after the definitive injunction--here, from April 23, 1991, to January 5, 1993--might be some evidence of an earlier waiver or settlement or even support a dismissal for non-prosecution.  Here, however, instead of complying with the injunction, the Board improperly delayed issuance of an adequate license until August 1992.  That Dimarco waited four more months before asking for a trial date does not count for much in a five-year-old case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Although we cannot find a waiver or settlement on this record, the possibility remains that Dimarco lost her unsettled, unwaived damage claim because of the judgment entered on April 23, 1991, granting a permanent injunction.  If that judgment constituted a final judgment disposing of the entire case, then the failure of Dimarco to pursue an appeal within the prescribed 30-day period would end the case.  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1).  Such a final judgment might still be reopened by post-judgment motion;  but the most familiar grounds (e.g., excusable neglect) require a motion within one year of the judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of \"terminat[ing] the action\" and starting the appeal clock on the entire case, a judgment is not final if it \"adjudicates fewer than all the claims\" asserted by a party.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).  We have already seen that in this case the judgment did not actually adjudicate all of Dimarco's claims since, so far as the record reveals, Dimarco still retained in April 1991 a damage claim that had not been waived or settled or tried.  Thus, sub specie aeternitatis there was on April 23, 1991, an appealable judgment (because of the injunction) but not a final judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Board could still rely upon the judgment as final if it had at least purported to be final.  Thus, if the April 23, 1991, judgment had explicitly terminated the entire case, we would treat that judgment as final, so far as a later attack upon it or attempt to undo it is concerned.  The point is that a judgment purporting to be final moves the case toward repose.  If errors remain, the proper course for an aggrieved litigant is to appeal, and to do so within the time allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in this instance the April 23, 1991, judgment does not on its face say anything to indicate either that it was resolving the damage claim or that it intended to terminate the entire case.  A judgment unambiguous on its face is construed as a writing without resort to extrinsic evidence;  given doubt, resort may be had to other orders or other evidence ascertainable from the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In this case, the April 23, 1991, order accompanying the judgment refers to the finding that Dimarco had passed the exam as \"the only issue remaining in the case.\"   The quoted statement should have alerted a careful lawyer to the possibility that the accompanying judgment--although not labeled \"final\"--was intended to dispose of all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if resort to the accompanying order helps the Board, the record in other respects assists Dimarco.  The damage claim had been asserted and never resolved.  Nor was it ripe for resolution in April 1991 since no license had issued and thus there was no end point for calculating any damages that might be due.  All of the attention of the parties to that point had been centered upon injunctive relief of two different types, and only injunctive relief was mentioned in the judgment.  The same judgment could have been entered even if the court intended to start a trial on damages the following day.  We think, therefore, that a measure of uncertainty remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no precise formula for construing judgments.  But we are reluctant to construe a judgment ambiguous on its face as a final judgment where it could plausibly be read as non-final, where extrinsic evidence does not wholly resolve the uncertainty, and where reading it as final could unfairly forfeit the rights of a party.  Here the facts already described leave us in doubt whether the judgment can fairly be construed as final;  there is a patent risk of unfairness to Dimarco;  and the Board is not unfairly prejudiced by reading the judgment to leave standing any damage claim that Dimarco did not previously waive or settle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains to consider the course to be followed on remand.  For reasons already explained, this record does not establish that Dimarco has waived or settled her damage claim.  Still, in view of the failure of anyone to disclose on appeal what happened on March 19, 1990, we think that justice requires that we not foreclose the Board on remand from offering evidence, if it has any, to establish that Dimarco did specifically waive or settle her damage claim at the March 19, 1990, conference.  The Board bears the burden of proving such a waiver or settlement.  Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we speak of the Board offering evidence, we are referring to any new evidence that shows that Dimarco on or about March 19, 1990, settled the damage claim or expressed an intention to waive it.  If the Board does have any evidence to offer, obviously Dimarco may respond to it, and the district court can then make findings to resolve the issue.  If no evidence is offered by the Board, then the court should proceed with the damage claim.  Whether the defendants are liable for damages is, of course, a matter on which we express no views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of May 12, 1993, is vacated as to Dimarco and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither of the parties named in the caption remain in this case.  The original plaintiff, John Harris, is not a party to this appeal.  Similarly, the first named defendant, Hector Rivera Cruz, the Secretary of Justice, was dismissed from the suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We clearly have jurisdiction to review the May 12, 1993, order inasmuch as it is itself final (no further proceedings being contemplated), and an appeal from it was filed within the prescribed period.  But we agree with the Board that, if the April 23, 1991, order were itself a final disposition of the entire case, it would be too late now to resurrect the damage claim.  This issue is addressed below</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Dimarco asserts that the claim could not have been relinquished under Puerto Rico law since there was no payment.  Whatever Puerto Rico law may say about out of court settlements, every litigator knows that--in the course of conferences with the judge as a case moves toward trial--complaints are narrowed by agreement and claims are abandoned without any payment.  The question is whether that happened here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The terminology can be confusing because a judgment may be appealable at once even though not \"final\" within the meaning of Rule 54(b).  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) (injunctions).  Yet because such situations are exceptions, it is commonplace to use the phrase \"final judgment\" as a synonym for \"appealable judgment,\" even though the concepts are not identical</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> E.g., Security Mutual Cas.
