This  appeal  arises out  of a\n                           \n\ncomplex commercial  dispute,  with  overtones  of  deception,\n\nrelating to the  construction of a hydroelectric  facility in\n\nMaine.    In  the ensuing  litigation,  neither  the builder,\n\nCombustion Engineering,  Inc., nor  the  owner, Miller  Hydro\n\nGroup,  succeeded  in  recovering against  the  other.   Both\n\nappeal.  We affirm the district court.\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n     In the early 1980's,  Miller Hydro set about  creating a\n\nhydroelectric facility on the Androscoggin River  near Lisbon\n\nFalls, Maine, to generate electricity.  It first negotiated a\n\ncontract with Central Maine Power Company by which the latter\n\nagreed to  purchase a  set amount of  power from  the planned\n\nfacility.   Miller  Hydro  also  obtained  financing  from  a\n\nFinnish bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, and  a license to build\n\nthe  project  from the  Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission\n\n(\"FERC\").\n\n     In May 1986,  Miller Hydro entered into  a contract--the\n\ncentral document  at  issue  in  this  case--with  Combustion\n\nEngineering  for  the  latter  to build  the  facility  on  a\n\n\"turnkey\" basis.   The turnkey contract,  by cross-reference,\n\nprovided for a facility including turbines with a capacity of\n\n7800 cubic  feet of  water per second.1   Under  its contract\n\n                    \n\n     1The  7800 cfs figure, which  is important to this case,\nappears  in technical specifications  annexed to  the turnkey\ncontract.   A shorter and more general \"project description,\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nwith  Maine Central  Power,  Miller  Hydro  was  expected  to\n\nprovide power capacity of 14  megawatts, and the Miller Hydro\n\ncontract  with Combustion Engineering  also referred  to this\n\nrequirement by cross-reference.  \n\n     Subject  to  these  and  other  specifications,  it  was\n\nentirely up to Combustion Engineering to design and build the\n\nnew facility.   The turnkey contract contained  incentive and\n\npenalty provisions,  one of which  lies at the heart  of this\n\ncase.  The price set for construction was fixed at just under\n\n$24  million,  but  the  contract  provided  that  Combustion\n\nEngineering would  earn a sliding-scale  bonus for efficiency\n\nto the extent  that the facility produced power  in excess of\n\n77,500  megawatt hours  per  year;  a  corresponding  penalty\n\nprovision reduced Combustion Engineering's fixed price to the\n\nextent that the  facility was less efficient than a specified\n\nminimum output of 73,500 megawatt hours per year.\n\n     The  turnkey contract provided that the bonus or penalty\n\nwould be determined by certain tests  that would be performed\n\nby an independent  tester at the completion  of construction.\n\nA  protocol  specified  how  the  test  would  be  conducted,\n\nincluding a  requirement that  the  facility be  tested at  a\n\n\"total flow of 7800 cfs.\"  It  also permitted Miller Hydro to\n\nrequire  a   retest  by  a   different  tester  if   it  were\n\n                    \n\nalso  annexed,  refers  to  turbine  discharge   capacity  of\n\"approximately 8,000\" cfs.\n\n                             -4-\n\ndissatisfied with  the  initial test.    It appears  that  if\n\nCombustion  Engineering had built a highly efficient plant of\n\nthe size specified, Miller Hydro might have been liable for a\n\nbonus payment as large as $850,000.\n\n     What  happened instead  is  that Combustion  Engineering\n\nbuilt a far larger plant  with turbines having a maximum flow\n\ncapacity of over 9000 cfs or more and a power capacity  of 18\n\nto 19 megawatts.   Miller Hydro claims that  this increase in\n\nsize  was  done  deliberately  and   secretly  by  Combustion\n\nEngineering  in order to  manipulate the bonus  provisions of\n\nthe construction contract.  Miller Hydro and Kansallis-Osake-\n\nPankki both say that they did not learn of the increase until\n\nit was too late to modify the facility.\n\n     When the facility was tested at a total  flow of 9000 or\n\nmore cfs, the tester reported results that equated to a bonus\n\nof over  $8  million.   In  Miller Hydro's  view,  Combustion\n\nEngineering had invested $1 million or so of its own money in\n\nincreasing the facility's  size in order  to reap a  ten-fold\n\nincrease  in the incentive bonus.  Miller Hydro also objected\n\nto the  test itself and  invoked its right  to a retest.   It\n\nalso refused to state its \"final acceptance\" of the facility,\n\nor to make final construction  payments.  Instead of agreeing\n\nto  a  retest, Combustion  Engineering promptly  brought suit\n\nagainst Miller Hydro in district court.  \n\n                             -5-\n\n     In its complaint Combustion Engineering set forth claims\n\nbased  on   contract,  unjust   enrichment,  and   promissory\n\nestoppel, and it sought to enforce a mechanic's lien  against\n\nthe facility.  As damages,  it demanded an incentive bonus of\n\n$8.16 million,  a final  construction payment  of $45,364,  a\n\nfurther  payment of $1,236,427 in amounts withheld from prior\n\npayments, and a  claimed early completion bonus  of $893,894.\n\nKansallis-Osake-Pankki  intervened,  arguing  that Combustion\n\nEngineering had by contract subordinated its rights under the\n\nmechanic's  lien  statute  to  the  bank's  mortgage  on  the\n\nfacility.\n\n     Miller   Hydro    counterclaimed   against    Combustion\n\nEngineering  asserting  contract,   fraud,  and  racketeering\n\nclaims.  Miller  Hydro tells us that Central  Maine Power has\n\nnot  agreed to  buy the  extra  power that  the facility  can\n\ngenerate and that Miller Hydro  will or may incur  additional\n\ncosts  as a  result  of  the facility's  enlarged  size.   In\n\nparticular, it says that it  may face penalties from FERC for\n\nbuilding a facility larger than the license permits, and that\n\nit may  have to  reconstruct fish-protection facilities  that\n\nwere keyed to the originally planned smaller turbines.\n\n     Because  the case  presented  both  legal and  equitable\n\nclaims,  the district  court  bifurcated the  trial.   In the\n\nfirst phase, Combustion Engineering tried its contract claims\n\nto the  jury and  Miller Hydro tried  its contract  and fraud\n\n                             -6-\n\ncounterclaims to the same jury.  (Miller Hydro's racketeering\n\ncounterclaim  was  dismissed by  the  court  in circumstances\n\nrecounted  below.)   In  the  second  phase the  trial  judge\n\nproposed   to  rule   himself  on   Combustion  Engineering's\n\nequitable claims (unjust enrichment and promissory  estoppel)\n\nand  to  resolve  any   outstanding  issues  concerning   the\n\nmechanic's   lien  claim,   including  priority   as  between\n\nCombustion Engineering and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki.\n\n     After Combustion Engineering presented its case in chief\n\nto the jury, the district  court entered judgment as a matter\n\nof law against Combustion Engineering on its contract claims.\n\nThe court  held that  Combustion  Engineering had  materially\n\nbreached its contract in testing the facility at a total flow\n\nin excess of 7800 cfs  and in other departures from the  test\n\nprotocol.   The court  found it  unnecessary to reach  Miller\n\nHydro's argument that  the refusal of Combustion  Engineering\n\nto  agree to  a  retest was  also a  breach of  contract that\n\nbarred recovery.\n\n     Miller  Hydro's  own  contract and  fraud  counterclaims\n\nagainst  Combustion Engineering  were submitted  to  the jury\n\ntogether with a  special verdict form.  On  January 23, 1992,\n\nthe  jury  returned  its  verdict,  finding  that  Combustion\n\nEngineering  had  breached  the  contract  by  designing  the\n\nfacility for a maximum flow in excess of 7800 cfs, and not in\n\naccordance  with  the  FERC  license.   It  found  the actual\n\n                             -7-\n\nmaximum  flow to be  at least 9000  cfs and the  power output\n\ncapacity to be  18 megawatts.  It also  found that Combustion\n\nEngineering  had  provided  materially  false information  to\n\nMiller Hydro.   Nevertheless, the jury awarded  no damages to\n\nMiller Hydro either for breach of contract or  fraud, finding\n\n(in  response to special verdict questions) that Miller Hydro\n\nhad not  proved damages  from the breach  of contract  or the\n\nmisrepresentations. \n\n     On October 6,  1992, the  trial judge  filed a  decision\n\ndenying  Combustion  Engineering  recovery on  its  equitable\n\nclaims.    The  court  held that  under  Maine  law  material\n\nbreaches  of  contract  did  not  automatically  preclude  an\n\nequitable recovery but that the plaintiff's good faith effort\n\nto  perform was  a  prerequisite; and  the  court ruled  that\n\nCombustion Engineering \"did  not seek in  good faith to  meet\n\nits  obligations  under  the  turnkey  contract,\"  given  the\n\ndeliberate breaches and misrepresentations found by the jury.\n\nThe jury findings, the court  said, were binding on the court\n\nin deciding the equitable claims.  \n\n     On  the same  day, the  trial judge  denied a  motion by\n\nCombustion  Engineering  requesting  the  court  to  order  a\n\nretesting of the  facility, to appoint a  special master, and\n\nto allow the  filing of a supplemental complaint.   The court\n\nruled that this motion, filed on June 3, 1992, well after the\n\njury  verdict,  came  too  late.    Not  only  had  extensive\n\n                             -8-\n\ndiscovery  been conducted but the jury trial had already been\n\nheld and  the case  was nearing  completion.   Further delay,\n\nsaid the court, would be unfair to both of the other parties.\n\n     Finally, by decision  entered on December 22,  1992, the\n\ntrial judge ruled on Combustion Engineering's mechanic's lien\n\nclaim.  It rejected the  claim on the ground that enforcement\n\nof such  a lien  required a valid  underlying claim  and that\n\nCombustion Engineering  had been found  to lack such  a valid\n\nclaim.  The court granted Kansallis-Osake-Pankki's request to\n\ndischarge  the mechanic's  lien.    It  also  granted  Miller\n\nHydro's requests, made in its counterclaims, for declarations\n\nof breach  of contract  and  misrepresentation by  Combustion\n\nEngineering.  \n\n     On January 11, 1993, the court entered final judgment in\n\nthe case.   Combustion Engineering has appealed  the directed\n\nverdict against it on its  contract claims, and the denial of\n\nits  equitable  claims,  its mechanics  lien  claim,  and its\n\nmotion  to  retest.   Miller Hydro  has appealed  the earlier\n\ndismissal of its racketeering counterclaim.  Neither side has\n\nexplicitly sought to  disturb the judgment on  Miller Hydro's\n\ncontract  and  fraud  counterclaims  entered  upon  the  jury\n\nverdict.\n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Combustion Engineering  advances a  series of  different\n\narguments on appeal, variously involving the directed verdict\n\n                             -9-\n\nagainst it  on  its contract  claims,  the dismissal  of  its\n\nequitable claims,  the district  court's refusal  to order  a\n\nretest, and  the ruling discharging the mechanic's  lien.  We\n\nbegin with these  issues, reserving for the  end a discussion\n\nof Miller Hydro's cross-appeal.\n\n     Combustion  Engineering's  first, and  most  extensively\n\nbriefed,  point  on  appeal  is its  attack  on  the district\n\ncourt's  grant of a directed verdict--now renamed judgment as\n\na matter of law, Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)--dismissing Combustion\n\nEngineering's  contract  claims  against  Miller  Hydro.   We\n\nreview  such  a dismissal  de  novo,  asking whether  on  the\n                                   \n\nevidence  presented  a  reasonable jury  could  find  for the\n\nplaintiff.   Murray v.  Ross-Dove Co., 5  F.3d 573,  576 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1993).  In considering this question, it is assumed that\n\nissues  of  credibility  are resolved,  and  inferences  from\n\nevidence drawn, in favor of the non-moving party.  Id.\n                                                      \n\n     At the threshold one might  think that the attack on the\n\ndirected verdict is barred by the jury's subsequent findings.\n\nThese  findings, on  Miller Hydro's  counterclaims, establish\n\nthat Combustion  Engineering breached the turnkey contract by\n\nbuilding  a  plant  well  in  excess  of  the  contracted for\n\ncapacity.   Miller Hydro  claims that  Combustion Engineering\n\nhas  forfeited its  right  to  challenge  those  findings  by\n\nfailing  to  \"appeal\"  from  the  jury   verdict;  Combustion\n\nEngineering  replies that  appeals  are from  judgments,  not\n\n                             -10-\n\nfindings, and that it has appealed the judgment rejecting its\n\ncontract claims.\n\n     We  think that  in this  case the  jury findings  do not\n\nsettle  the propriety  of  the directed  verdict.   The  jury\n\nverdict might  insulate the directed  verdict if the  jury in\n\ndeciding the counterclaims had independently reached the same\n                                            \n\nconclusion on the same issue.   But here the trial  judge, in\n\nsubmitting the counterclaims to the jury, instructed the jury\n\nthat as  a matter of  law \"the turnkey contract  required the\n\nconstruction of a hydroelectric facility  . . . . designed to\n\naccommodate a maximum  hydraulic flow of 7800  cubic feet per\n\nsecond.\"2 \n\n     A central  theme of Combustion Engineering's argument on\n\nappeal is that the contract  did not make 7800 cfs a  maximum\n\nfigure.   We  think it  would be odd  to uphold  the directed\n\nverdict on the  ground that the jury found the  same thing as\n\nthe district  judge (namely, that  the 7800 cfs figure  was a\n\nceiling) when  in fact the district  judge told it  to do so.\n\nThis  is not  to  say that  the district  court  erred in  so\n\ninstructing  the jury--on  the contrary,  we  agree with  its\n\nreading of  the contract--but rather to explain  why we think\n\n                    \n\n     2The court also told the  jury that the court itself had\nrejected Combustion Engineering's contract claims because the\ncourt had found (in directing a verdict) a material breach of\ncontract by Combustion  Engineering, namely,  its failure  to\nshow compliance \"with the testing requirement of testing at a\ntotal flow of  7800 cfs\" as required by  the protocol annexed\nto the turnkey contract.\n\n                             -11-\n\nthat the directed  verdict decision by the district  court is\n\nnot insulated by  the jury verdict and should  be reviewed on\n\nthe merits.\n\n     Turning  to the  merits, the  first issue  before us  in\n\nrelation  to  the  directed verdict  is  whether  the testing\n\nprotocol required that the final acceptance test be conducted\n\nat a  maximum of  7800  cfs.   Although  formally this  is  a\n\nseparate  issue from whether  the turnkey contract  made 7800\n\ncfs  the maximum  size for  the facility,  we think  that the\n\nreality here  is that the  two issues are interrelated.   One\n\nmight be able to read the 7800  cfs figure differently in the\n\ntest protocol  and the  contract  design specifications,  but\n\nwould  be  unlikely  to  do  so in  this  case.    Combustion\n\nEngineering treats the two issues together, and so do we.\n\n     The district  court construed  the turnkey  contract and\n\nruled as  a matter  of law  that the  7800 cfs  figure was  a\n\ntarget and ceiling  figure for both construction  and testing\n\nof the  facility.  As noted  above, the 7800  cfs figure does\n\nappear   in   annexed   technical   specifications   although\n\napparently  not in  the body  of the  contract itself.   This\n\ncross-reference  might not be  conclusive if it  stood alone,\n\nbut it does  not stand alone.   Two other pieces of  evidence\n\nintrinsic  to the  contract--the FERC  license  and the  test\n         \n\nprotocol--support the view  that the 7800 cfs figure was both\n\ntarget and ceiling for the project.\n\n                             -12-\n\n     First,  the FERC license was incorporated in the turnkey\n\ncontract  by  cross reference,  the  contractor  promising to\n\nconstruct the  facility in accordance with the  license.  The\n\nFERC license refers to the  project as having turbines with a\n\ntotal capacity  of 14 megawatts,  a figure  that the  turnkey\n\ncontract treats as a counterpart to the 7800 cfs  figure.  As\n\nalready  noted, the turnkey  contract refers to  14 megawatts\n\nand the annexed technical specifications to 7800 cfs.3\n\n     Second, the test protocol annexed to the turnkey project\n\nclearly provided for  testing at \"a total flow  of 7800 cfs.\"\n\nOne can imagine a  contract providing for a facility   with a\n\nlarge capacity  while limiting the test to  some lower figure\n\n(perhaps  the  expected  normal flow).    Here,  however, the\n\nreference  to the same figure in the technical specifications\n\nand in  the test  protocol strongly suggests  as a  matter of\n\ncommon sense that the facility was  to be built and tested at\n\nthat figure.\n\n     Combustion Engineering's brief argues that the 7800  cfs\n\nfigure  was actually intended  as a minimum,  urging that the\n                                           \n\nfigure be read as akin to other figures in the  contract that\n\nare  allegedly  performance minima.    Combustion Engineering\n\n                    \n\n     3There was  also evidence  that the  license application\ninitially reflected a  flow of 6800 cfs and  that approval of\nFERC to increase this to 7800 was obtained in 1985.  However,\nthere is some doubt that  this evidence could be described as\nintrinsic, at least in the form submitted, and we do not rely\nupon it to sustain the directed verdict.\n\n                             -13-\n\nalso suggests that in  any event the  7800 figure was only  a\n\nrough  approximation.    It  also  argues  that  the  parties\n\ncontemplated  modifications  in whatever  figure  was chosen.\n\nFinally, it claims that Miller  Hydro learned of the increase\n\nand waived  its objection.   Some of  these arguments  are in\n\ntension with others, and none is persuasive.\n\n     There  may be figures  in the turnkey  contract that are\n\nperformance minima.   But certainly  the normal reading  of a\n\nperformance or capacity figure in a license is that, like the\n                                           \n\nspeed limit sign on a highway,  it is intended as a  maximum.\n\nHere, the contract said that the facility  was to be built in\n\naccordance with  the license, and the license  provided for a\n\n14  megawatt facility, a figure that the contract's technical\n\nspecifications equated  to a  facility having  a capacity  of\n\n7800 cfs.   Thus, we  think that  7800 cfs was  a target  and\n\nceiling and not a minimum.\n\n     We agree with Combustion Engineering's claim  that, even\n\ntreating 7800 cfs as a  ceiling, there may be room  for minor\n\ndeviations;  but an increase to over 9000 cfs--there was some\n\ntestimony that  9600 cfs  or more  was the  real capacity--is\n\nhardly  a  minor  change.     Correspondingly,  the  megawatt\n\ncapacity increased from 14 megawatts to 18 megawatts or more,\n\nhardly  a  minor  adjustment.    The  engineer  who  assisted\n\nCombustion  Engineering testified that a change from 7800 cfs\n\nto 9000 cfs or more would be material.\n\n                             -14-\n\n     There were  provisions for  modification of  the turnkey\n\ncontract  by  agreement, but  Combustion Engineering  has not\n\nproved   any  agreement  by   Miller  Hydro   permitting  the\n\ncontractor to exceed the  7800 cfs figure.  As  for the claim\n\nof waiver or estoppel, that  issue was submitted to the jury.\n\nThe jury's verdict that  Combustion Engineering breached  the\n\ncontract  by constructing a  facility in  excess of  7800 cfs\n\nappears  implicitly to reject the waiver or estoppel defense.\n\nThis is quite understandable since there is no clear evidence\n\nthat Miller Hydro knew of the change in capacity until it was\n\ntoo  late to alter course, and substantial evidence indicates\n\nthat Combustion Engineering sought to conceal its deviation. \n\n     Combustion Engineering argues that at the very least the\n\ncontract  was ambiguous,  so that  extrinsic evidence  should\n\nhave been admitted and  the issue submitted to a  jury.  Some\n\njurisdictions  follow  the traditional  binary  rule  that an\n\nintegrated contract  is either clear or ambiguous and, in the\n\nformer  case, extrinsic  evidence  is excluded;  other states\n\nfollow  the  so-called  modern approach,  allowing  extrinsic\n\nevidence  to   \"interpret\"  even   a  seemingly   unambiguous\n\ndocument.   See  A. Farnsworth, Contracts    7.12,  at 521-23\n                                         \n\n(1990).  But  we need not decide  in this case precisely  how\n\nMaine resolves  the problem,  because Combustion  Engineering\n\nhas not properly pointed to any extrinsic evidence that could\n\nalter the result.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     We   say    \"properly\"   pointed    because   Combustion\n\nEngineering's  brief  does  have an  entire  page  of capsule\n\nsummaries of  documents,  events or  testimony purporting  to\n\ncomprise  relevant extrinsic  evidence.    In  this  page  of\n\nsummaries, not  a single  reference appears  to a  transcript\n\npage or an exhibit number or to an appendix or addendum page.\n\nThere is some  similar material in the fact  statement of the\n\nbrief, with record or appendix references, and we have sought\n\nto match up the summaries  with relevant portions of the fact\n\nstatement.  Having  done so as best we can, our conclusion is\n\nthat this  \"evidence,\" even  if considered,  does not  create\n\nambiguities warranting jury resolution.\n\n     To take  Combustion Engineering's first  capsule summary\n\nas an  example, the brief  says that an engineer  working for\n\nboth  Combustion Engineering and Miller Hydro told the latter\n\nthat \"the Turbine  Specifications were minimums that  did not\n\nlimit Combustion  Engineering's right  to select  appropriate\n\nequipment.\"   The engineer's actual  letter, however,  merely\n\naffirms  the contractor's right  to design the  generator and\n\nelectrical equipment and says  that \"the overall  performance\n\nexpected  of  the  equipment  was  outlined  in  the  minimum\n\ncriteria . .  . .\"  Nothing  in the quotation associates  the\n\ngeneral  reference  to  minimum criteria  with  the  7800 cfs\n\nfigure.  The balance of the evidence summarized by Combustion\n\nEngineering is even less persuasive.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     Later in its brief, Combustion Engineering makes a quite\n\ndifferent  argument.   It  says  that  even assuming  that  a\n\nviolation  of the  test protocol  occurred,  this should  not\n\ndebar  Combustion Engineering  from  all recovery  under  the\n\ncontract.  It argues that  testing was directed to fixing the\n\nefficiency bonus or  penalty, and that proper  testing should\n\nnot be  found to  be a \"condition  precedent\" to  recovery of\n\nother  amounts,  such  as the  final  payment  due  under the\n\ncontract or sums  retained temporarily  from prior  payments.\n\nThe  company  also  invokes  the  notion   that  \"substantial\n\nperformance\" is sufficient to allowit to sue on the contract.\n\n     It may be  a close question  whether standing alone  the\n\nbreach   of  a   testing   protocol--among  other   breaches,\n\nCombustion  Engineering tested  the facility  at  a flow  far\n\ngreater  than  7800  cfs--should  preclude  recovery  of  the\n\nbalance of the contract price  as well as the possible bonus.\n\nIf this were  the posture of the case, we would be obliged to\n\nengage  in a  close  reading  of the  test  protocol and  its\n\nrelation  to the  rest of  the contract.   One  can certainly\n\nconceive of a case in which the contractor failed to fulfil a\n\nrequirement needed to earn a  bonus payment but would not, in\n\nordinary  circumstances, be  deemed  to  lose  the  right  to\n\ncollect the basic price for work done.\n\n     Here, however, Combustion Engineering  violated not only\n\nthe test protocol but the contract specifications by building\n\n                             -17-\n\nan oversized  facility, and  the breach  was substantial  and\n\ndeliberate.   The jury verdict alone confirms the substantial\n\nbreach,   and  its  deliberate   character  is   patent  from\n\nCombustion  Engineering's misrepresentations  and efforts  at\n\nconcealment.   Even if the violation  of the testing protocol\n\ndid not  preclude all  further recovery  under the  contract,\n\nassuredly  the substantial and  deliberate breach did  so and\n\nprecludes  a   contractual   claim   based   on   substantial\n\nperformance.  \n\n     This premise of a substantial and deliberate breach also\n\ndisposes  of Combustion  Engineering's  equitable claims  for\n\nunjust enrichment and promissory estoppel.  We agree with the\n\ndistrict court  that, even  if such  claims may  be permitted\n\nunder  Maine law  where contractual  claims  have been  lost,\n\nMaine  law appears  to make  good faith  a condition  of such\n\nequitably based  recoveries.4  Here  Combustion Engineering's\n\ngood faith is  disproved by the jury verdicts.   The verdicts\n\n                    \n\n     4The  most recent Maine decision  to which we are cited,\nsays  that an  equitable  recovery may  be  allowed when  the\nbuilder  provided  materials  or   services  \"in  an   honest\nendeavor\"  to  perform  the  contract.    Loyal  Erectors  v.\n                                                         \nHamilton  &amp;  Son,  Inc., 312  A.2d  748,  755-56  (Me. 1973);\n                      \nAccord,  Levine v.  Reynolds, 54  A.2d 514,  517 (Me.  1947).\n                            \nEven  if Maine  law is  more fluid,  allowing the  judge some\nflexibility  in weighing  the  equities, see  A. Horton  &amp; P.\nMcGehee,  Maine Civil Remedies,  11-17 (2d ed.  1992), we are\n                              \ncertain  from its  statements here  that  the district  court\nwould exercise that  discretion to disallow recovery,  and we\nwould have no difficulty sustaining that decision.\n\n                             -18-\n\nwere binding on the court, see Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 469 (1962), and are amply supported by the evidence.\n\n     This  outcome  becomes  even  more  compelling when  one\n\nappreciates that the deliberate and substantial breach placed\n\nMiller Hydro at risk of significant harm.  There may be cases\n\nwhere building \"more\"  than one promised is a  benefit to the\n\nowner; but  that is hardly assured in the case of a federally\n\nlicensed dam.   Indeed,  it may be  that Miller  Hydro itself\n\nwill  ultimately suffer because  of violation of  its federal\n\nlicense  terms or because the fish protection facilities will\n\nhave to be  rebuilt.  Nor is  it clear that it  has gained by\n\nobtaining extra  power that  it says it  can neither  sell to\n\nCentralMaine Power nor economically wheel to other customers.\n\n     Miller Hydro  alludes  to  these  possibilities  without\n\nproviding much supporting detail.   We have no way of knowing\n\nhow much substance  there is to them, nor  whether short term\n\ndisadvantages may be offset  in part, or even outweighed,  by\n\nthe long-term benefits  of a larger  facility with a  greater\n\ncapacity  to  produce  power.    What  we  do  know  is  that\n\nCombustion  Engineering was not entitled to create such risks\n\nfor  Miller  Hydro by  secretly  deviating--substantially and\n\ndeliberately--from  the  terms  of the  contract.    That one\n\nbehaving  in this fashion now forfeits  the balance due under\n\nthe contract does not seem in the least unfair.\n\n                             -19-\n\n     Combustion Engineering has  two remaining arguments that\n\nrequire little  discussion.  It  first argues that  the court\n\nshould have granted  its motion for a retest  of the facility\n\nin accordance  with the protocol.   This demand was  made not\n\nonly  after  Combustion Engineering  had  turned down  Miller\n\nHydro's  own request  for  retest,  but  after  the  directed\n\nverdict  and the  jury verdict  in this  case.   The district\n\ncourt's   refusal  to  grant  this  highly  belated,  if  not\n\nimpudent,  request for equitable  relief was well  within its\n\ndiscretion.  \n\n     The other argument is Combustion Engineering's attack on\n\nthe  district court's  refusal to grant  it relief  under the\n\nMaine    mechanic's   lien   statute.      It   may   be   an\n\noversimplification  to say that  the statute creates  only an\n\nadditional remedy and not  a new right; but it  is clear that\n\nunder Maine  law, as  in many  jurisdictions, the  mechanic's\n\nlien depends  on the claimant having a valid underlying claim\n\nfor monetary  recovery based on  the construction  performed.\n\nBangor Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Robbins Plumbing Co., 116\n                                                        \n\nA.2d 664, 666 (Me. 1955).  Combustion Engineering has no such\n\nvalid underlying claim  in this case,  so the district  court\n\nproperly discharged the mechanic's lien.\n\n     There remains  Miller Hydro's  own appeal.   As  already\n\nnoted,  the   jury   found  (in   deciding   Miller   Hydro's\n\ncounterclaims) that  Combustion Engineering had  breached its\n\n                             -20-\n\ncontract  and engaged in misrepresentation but that the proof\n\ndid  not support  a finding  of  damages from  the breach  or\n\nfalsehoods.   Miller Hydro does not challenge these verdicts,\n\nwhich limited  its judgment  on these  claims to  declaratory\n\nrelief.  Rather,  it argues that the district  court erred by\n\ndismissing  its   remaining  racketeering   counterclaim  and\n\ndeclining to submit that claim to the jury.\n\n     The  remaining  counterclaim   comprised  three  related\n\ncounts   under   the   Racketeer   Influenced   and   Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act,  18 U.S.C.    1961, et seq. (\"RICO\").   In\n                                              \n\nsubstance,  these  RICO  counts,  asserted  in  a   pleadings\n\namendment,  charged Combustion Engineering and various of its\n\nemployees with a fraudulent scheme to obtain inflated bonuses\n\nfrom  one or more power-plant construction projects.  Various\n\nuses  of  the  mails  or  telephone  system  in  aid  of  the\n\nfraudulent scheme  were alleged.   For  the RICO  violations,\n\nMiller   Hydro  sought   damages,   injunctive  relief,   and\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n     After the RICO counts were added, Combustion Engineering\n\non April 16, 1991, moved to dismiss the counts under  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim; it asserted as\n\ngrounds for  dismissal various somewhat technical  defects in\n\nthe RICO counterclaims  (e.g., that  a separate  \"enterprise\"\n                             \n\nhad not been sufficiently alleged).   On October 4, 1991, the\n\ndistrict court granted the motion  to dismiss but on a ground\n\n                             -21-\n\nonly  barely suggested by  a footnote in  the motion, namely,\n\nthat an  earlier, October  19, 1990,  discovery order  by the\n\nmagistrate judge had found a  failure of Miller Hydro to make\n\nout a prima facie case of fraud by Combustion Engineering.  \n                 \n\n     The   magistrate  judge's  order  had  been  entered  in\n\nresolving discovery disputes  including Miller Hydro's  claim\n\nthat  Combustion Engineering had  lost the protection  of the\n\nattorney client privilege as to certain materials because its\n\nattorney   was   participating   in   a  fraudulent   scheme.\n\nInterpreting  Maine law governing  the privilege, see  Me. R.\n                                                     \n\nEvid.  502(d)(1),  the  magistrate  judge  found  that Miller\n\nHydro's evidence thus far made out the necessary prima  facie\n                                                             \n\ncase  on  \"the first  three  elements  of fraud  [knowing  or\n\nreckless  misrepresentation of a  material fact] but  not the\n\nfinal two [purpose and effect of inducing reliance].\"  Absent\n\nsufficient proof of each element  needed to prove fraud,  the\n\nmagistrate judge found no  loss of the privilege and  refused\n\nto order protection of the documents in issue.\n\n     On  appeal,  Miller  Hydro  complains  sharply  that  in\n\nresolving the Rule 12(b)(6) motion  the district judge had no\n\nright  to  rely  on materials  beyond  the  pleadings without\n\ngiving Miller Hydro notice and  an opportunity to counter the\n\nextra-pleading material.  Although Rule 12(b)(6) does require\n\n\"a  reasonable opportunity\" to  counter material  outside the\n\npleadings, the magistrate  judge's finding of no  prima facie\n                                                             \n\n                             -22-\n\ncase  was cited in Combustion Engineering's motion to dismiss\n\nand  arguably Miller Hydro  had the necessary  opportunity to\n\ncounter it.  This court  has looked through form to substance\n\nin applying  the rule's  requirement.  See  Moody v.  Town of\n                                                             \n\nWeymouth, 805 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir. 1986).\n        \n\n     What  is  more  troublesome is  Miller  Hydro's further,\n\nsubstantive  argument  that  the magistrate  judge's  finding\n\ncannot support the district court's order dismissing the RICO\n\nclaims.  All  that the finding showed, says  Miller Hydro, is\n\nthat  in October 1990, while discovery was still underway, it\n\nlacked enough evidence to show that all elements of fraud had\n\nbeen made  out to the  extent needed to vitiate  the attorney\n\nclient privilege.5  Even assuming  that the standards are the\n\nsame for  proving fraud  in relation  to the  attorney-client\n\nprivilege  issue and in relation to a RICO claim, it does not\n\nfollow  that evidence  was equally  lacking  in October  1991\n\nafter further discovery had been conducted.\n\n     The district court did  not discuss any of  the evidence\n\nin its  brief order of  dismissal in October 1991.   Further,\n\nthe court  actually allowed  the Maine  fraud claims  made by\n\nMiller  Hydro to  go the  jury.   Yet common alleged  acts of\n\nfraud  underlay  both the  Maine  fraud  and the  RICO  fraud\n\n                    \n\n     5The standard of  proof is rather elusive since  a prima\n                                                             \nfacie  case does not require  definitive proof; yet the fraud\n     \nclaim itself has  to be proved under  Maine law by  clear and\nconvincing evidence.  \n\n                             -23-\n\ncounts.   Indeed,  Miller Hydro  argues  that RICO  fraud  is\n\neasier to prove than fraud under Maine law because the latter\n\nrequires that each element be proved by clear and  convincing\n\nevidence.  The district court's seeming concession that there\n\nwas enough evidence  of fraud under Maine law  adds to doubts\n\nwhether we could  sustain the court's  dismissal of the  RICO\n\ncounts based on the magistrate judge's finding.\n\n     We need  not resolve  the matter,  however, because  the\n\njury's  verdict  taken  together   with  other  circumstances\n\npersuades  us that  Miller Hydro  was  not prejudiced  by the\n\ndismissal of the RICO claims.  The jury found that no damages\n\nhad been proved by Miller Hydro on the two counterclaims that\n\ndid reach the jury  even though the jury found both breach of\n\ncontract  by Combustion  Engineering  and  acts amounting  to\n\nfraud.   The  central damage  claims  argued to  the jury  by\n\nMiller  Hydro--e.g., delay  costs, prospective  rebuilding of\n                   \n\nthe fishways--are  common to the  Maine fraud and  RICO fraud\n\nclaims,  and the  jury finding  of no  damages on  the former\n\nsuggests the same outcome would have resulted on the latter.\n\n     Miller Hydro  argues, although without much detail, that\n\nits damage  claims based on breach of  contract were somewhat\n\nnarrower than  those covered  by fraud.   Its theory  is that\n\ncontract  damages must  be within  the  contemplation of  the\n\nparties but  fraud damages  need not be,  and we  will assume\n\nthat  this  is  so.    But  Miller  Hydro  does  not  suggest\n\n                             -24-\n\n(attorney's fees  aside) that  its actual  damages for  fraud\n\nwere narrower under Maine law  than under RICO and, given the\n\ncommon acts  of  alleged fraud,  it is  hard to  see why  the\n\ndamage claims under  RICO would be broader.   Instead, Miller\n\nHydro simply asserts that the fraud damage claims under Maine\n\nlaw  required clear and convincing evidence while those under\n\nRICO required merely a preponderance of the evidence.  \n\n     It is by  no means clear that the jury was told that the\n\nfraud damages  under Maine law had to  be proved by clear and\n\nconvincing  evidence.6    But  even  if  the  jury  had  been\n\nexplicitly told clear and convincing evidence was required in\n\ncomputing   damages,  we  would  still  find  no  showing  of\n\nprejudice in this  case.  Perhaps where the  issue of damages\n\nis shown to be very  close--turning, for instance, on a clash\n\nof  expert opinions--the  asserted  difference  in burden  of\n\nproof between a common law fraud and a civil RICO claim could\n\nbe decisive.  See Wilcox  v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon,\n                                                            \n\n815 F.2d 522, 531 (9th Cir. 1987).  But the burden of showing\n\n                    \n\n     6The district  court's generally lucid  instructions did\ntell the jury that the elements of fraud under Maine law  had\nto be established by clear and convincing evidence.  But when\nthe court came to instructing  on the computation of damages,\nwhere  it discussed contract  and fraud damages  together, it\ndid not say that any  of these determinations had to be  made\n                              \nby clear  and convincing  evidence.  Indeed,  the jury  could\neasily  have inferred the contrary  because the court went on\nto  say that  an award  of  exemplary damages  did require  a\nfinding of malice by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n                             -25-\n\nprejudice is upon the party claiming error, and we think that\n\nhere that burden has not been met.\n\n     Miller Hydro's main efforts at trial appear to have been\n\ndevoted  to establishing  Combustion Engineering's  breach of\n\ncontract and  fraud, findings  very important  in shoring  up\n\nMiller Hydro's own defense to Combustion Engineering's claims\n\nagainst  it.   When a  directed verdict  was served,  after a\n\ndirected verdict was  ordered, Miller Hydro chose  to present\n\nno  case  in  chief  of  its  own  in  support  of   its  own\n\ncounterclaims.    Instead,  Miller  Hydro  relied   upon  the\n\nevidence that Combustion  Engineering had offered in  its own\n\ncase in chief before the directed verdict was granted.  It is\n\nnot  surprising  that,   absent  an  affirmative  independent\n\nshowing as to  how Miller Hydro would suffer  from the larger\n\nfacility,  the jury  awarded  no  damages.    Miller  Hydro's\n\ndecision to stop while ahead  was probably good tactics,  but\n\nit does not suggest that an adjustment in the burden of proof\n\nwould have altered the result.\n\n     More important, there is nothing in Miller Hydro's reply\n\nbrief--which  offers the burden  of proof distinction  as the\n\nbasis for presuming prejudice--that discusses the evidence of\n\ndamages in  any detail  or provides  any basis  for believing\n\nthat a different standard of  proof could alter the result in\n\nthis  case.    In the  present  circumstances,  including the\n\nnature of  the jury  instructions and  the seemingly  limited\n\n                             -26-\n\nweight  placed  on  damages  at  trial,  we  think  that  the\n\ntheoretical  possibility of a different result is not enough.\n\nAnd absent a showing that would suggest a real possibility of\n\na  different result,  it  is time  for  this already  lengthy\n\nlitigation to come to an end.\n\n     Having considered consequential  damages, it remains  to\n\naddress two other possible differences in remedy.  First, the\n\nRICO statute allows attorney's  fees to a person \"injured  in\n\nhis business  or property\" by a RICO  violation.  18 U.S.C.  \n\n1964(c).  It is far from clear, however, that such attorney's\n\nfees would be  available where, as here, the  jury finds that\n\nno actual injury  has been proved.  Again,  given the absence\n\nof  some showing  by Miller  Hydro  that a  jury could  award\n\ndamages  limited solely to attorney's fees,  we think that no\n\nshowing of prejudice has been made.\n\n     Second, Miller  Hydro argues  that under  RICO it  would\n\nhave  been  entitled  to injunctive  relief  that  remains of\n\ncontinuing importance to  it.  Specifically, it  asserts that\n\nCombustion Engineering, having  had its belated motion  for a\n\nretest denied  by the district  court, is now trying  (how is\n\nnot explained) to pursue its demand for a retest though other\n\nmeans.     This  conduct,  says  Miller   Hydro,  constitutes\n\ncontinuing RICO fraud that the district court would have been\n\nasked to  enjoin if the  RICO claims had not  been dismissed.\n\n                             -27-\n\nSee  18 U.S.C.    1964(a) (injunctive remedy  available under\n   \n\nRICO).\n\n     We think this  is too  thin a  reed on which  to hang  a\n\nremand  and further litigation  under RICO.   Taken together,\n\nthe district  court's dismissal  of Combustion  Engineering's\n\ncontract  and equitable claims and  the court's denial of the\n\nbelated  motion  for  a retest  establish  definitively  that\n\nCombustion Engineering has no  further claim for a retest  or\n\nany other remedy under  the turnkey contract.   If Combustion\n\nEngineering   were  to  pursue  any  such  claim  through  an\n\nindependent  law suit, we  think that sanctions  for baseless\n\nlitigation might well be available.\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n     This  case  could  plausibly have  been  settled  at the\n\noutset by, for  example, payment of any remaining amounts due\n\nunder the contract but without any bonus payment.  Now, after\n\nwearisome and no doubt expensive litigation over an imperfect\n\ncontract  and imperfect conduct, neither side has gained what\n\nit  sought at  the outset.    This may  itself be  a  form of\n\njustice, but it could have been achieved at a lower price.\n\n     Affirmed.  No costs.\n             \n\n                             -28-\n",

In the ensuing litigation, neither the builder, Combustion Engineering, Inc., nor the owner, Miller Hydro Group, succeeded in recovering against the other.  Both appeal.  We affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980's, Miller Hydro set about creating a hydroelectric facility on the Androscoggin River near Lisbon Falls, Maine, to generate electricity.  It first negotiated a contract with Central Maine Power Company by which the latter agreed to purchase a set amount of power from the planned facility.  Miller Hydro also obtained financing from a Finnish bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, and a license to build the project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1986, Miller Hydro entered into a contract--the central document at issue in this case--with Combustion Engineering for the latter to build the facility on a \"turnkey\" basis.  The turnkey contract, by cross-reference, provided for a facility including turbines with a capacity of 7800 cubic feet of water per second.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Under its contract with Maine Central Power, Miller Hydro was expected to provide power capacity of 14 megawatts, and the Miller Hydro contract with Combustion Engineering also referred to this requirement by cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to these and other specifications, it was entirely up to Combustion Engineering to design and build the new facility.  The turnkey contract contained incentive and penalty provisions, one of which lies at the heart of this case.  The price set for construction was fixed at just under $24 million, but the contract provided that Combustion Engineering would earn a sliding-scale bonus for efficiency to the extent that the facility produced power in excess of 77,500 megawatt hours per year;  a corresponding penalty provision reduced Combustion Engineering's fixed price to the extent that the facility was less efficient than a specified minimum output of 73,500 megawatt hours per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The turnkey contract provided that the bonus or penalty would be determined by certain tests that would be performed by an independent tester at the completion of construction.  A protocol specified how the test would be conducted, including a requirement that the facility be tested at a \"total flow of 7800 cfs.\"   It also permitted Miller Hydro to require a retest by a different tester if it were dissatisfied with the initial test.  It appears that if Combustion Engineering had built a highly efficient plant of the size specified, Miller Hydro might have been liable for a bonus payment as large as $850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What happened instead is that Combustion Engineering built a far larger plant with turbines having a maximum flow capacity of over 9000 cfs or more and a power capacity of 18 to 19 megawatts.  Miller Hydro claims that this increase in size was done deliberately and secretly by Combustion Engineering in order to manipulate the bonus provisions of the construction contract.  Miller Hydro and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki both say that they did not learn of the increase until it was too late to modify the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the facility was tested at a total flow of 9000 or more cfs, the tester reported results that equated to a bonus of over $8 million.  In Miller Hydro's view, Combustion Engineering had invested $1 million or so of its own money in increasing the facility's size in order to reap a ten-fold increase in the incentive bonus.  Miller Hydro also objected to the test itself and invoked its right to a retest.  It also refused to state its \"final acceptance\" of the facility, or to make final construction payments.  Instead of agreeing to a retest, Combustion Engineering promptly brought suit against Miller Hydro in district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint Combustion Engineering set forth claims based on contract, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel, and it sought to enforce a mechanic's lien against the facility.  As damages, it demanded an incentive bonus of $8.16 million, a final construction payment of $45,364, a further payment of $1,236,427 in amounts withheld from prior payments, and a claimed early completion bonus of $893,894.  Kansallis-Osake-Pankki intervened, arguing that Combustion Engineering had by contract subordinated its rights under the mechanic's lien statute to the bank's mortgage on the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro counterclaimed against Combustion Engineering asserting contract, fraud, and racketeering claims.  Miller Hydro tells us that Central Maine Power has not agreed to buy the extra power that the facility can generate and that Miller Hydro will or may incur additional costs as a result of the facility's enlarged size.  In particular, it says that it may face penalties from FERC for building a facility larger than the license permits, and that it may have to reconstruct fish-protection facilities that were keyed to the originally planned smaller turbines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case presented both legal and equitable claims, the district court bifurcated the trial.  In the first phase, Combustion Engineering tried its contract claims to the jury and Miller Hydro tried its contract and fraud counterclaims to the same jury.  (Miller Hydro's racketeering counterclaim was dismissed by the court in circumstances recounted below.)   In the second phase the trial judge proposed to rule himself on Combustion Engineering's equitable claims (unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel) and to resolve any outstanding issues concerning the mechanic's lien claim, including priority as between Combustion Engineering and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Combustion Engineering presented its case in chief to the jury, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law against Combustion Engineering on its contract claims.  The court held that Combustion Engineering had materially breached its contract in testing the facility at a total flow in excess of 7800 cfs and in other departures from the test protocol.  The court found it unnecessary to reach Miller Hydro's argument that the refusal of Combustion Engineering to agree to a retest was also a breach of contract that barred recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro's own contract and fraud counterclaims against Combustion Engineering were submitted to the jury together with a special verdict form.  On January 23, 1992, the jury returned its verdict, finding that Combustion Engineering had breached the contract by designing the facility for a maximum flow in excess of 7800 cfs, and not in accordance with the FERC license.  It found the actual maximum flow to be at least 9000 cfs and the power output capacity to be 18 megawatts.  It also found that Combustion Engineering had provided materially false information to Miller Hydro.  Nevertheless, the jury awarded no damages to Miller Hydro either for breach of contract or fraud, finding (in response to special verdict questions) that Miller Hydro had not proved damages from the breach of contract or the misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1992, the trial judge filed a decision denying Combustion Engineering recovery on its equitable claims.  The court held that under Maine law material breaches of contract did not automatically preclude an equitable recovery but that the plaintiff's good faith effort to perform was a prerequisite;  and the court ruled that Combustion Engineering \"did not seek in good faith to meet its obligations under the turnkey contract,\" given the deliberate breaches and misrepresentations found by the jury.  The jury findings, the court said, were binding on the court in deciding the equitable claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the trial judge denied a motion by Combustion Engineering requesting the court to order a retesting of the facility, to appoint a special master, and to allow the filing of a supplemental complaint.  The court ruled that this motion, filed on June 3, 1992, well after the jury verdict, came too late.  Not only had extensive discovery been conducted but the jury trial had already been held and the case was nearing completion.  Further delay, said the court, would be unfair to both of the other parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by decision entered on December 22, 1992, the trial judge ruled on Combustion Engineering's mechanic's lien claim.  It rejected the claim on the ground that enforcement of such a lien required a valid underlying claim and that Combustion Engineering had been found to lack such a valid claim.  The court granted Kansallis-Osake-Pankki's request to discharge the mechanic's lien.  It also granted Miller Hydro's requests, made in its counterclaims, for declarations of breach of contract and misrepresentation by Combustion Engineering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1993, the court entered final judgment in the case.  Combustion Engineering has appealed the directed verdict against it on its contract claims, and the denial of its equitable claims, 812 F.Supp. 260, its mechanics lien claim, and its motion to retest.  Miller Hydro has appealed the earlier dismissal of its racketeering counterclaim.  Neither side has explicitly sought to disturb the judgment on Miller Hydro's contract and fraud counterclaims entered upon the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering advances a series of different arguments on appeal, variously involving the directed verdict against it on its contract claims, the dismissal of its equitable claims, the district court's refusal to order a retest, and the ruling discharging the mechanic's lien.  We begin with these issues, reserving for the end a discussion of Miller Hydro's cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering's first, and most extensively briefed, point on appeal is its attack on the district court's grant of a directed verdict--now renamed judgment as a matter of law, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)--dismissing Combustion Engineering's contract claims against Miller Hydro.  We review such a dismissal de novo, asking whether on the evidence presented a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff.  Murray v. Ross-Dove Co., 5 F.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir.1993).  In considering this question, it is assumed that issues of credibility are resolved, and inferences from evidence drawn, in favor of the non-moving party.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold one might think that the attack on the directed verdict is barred by the jury's subsequent findings.  These findings, on Miller Hydro's counterclaims, establish that Combustion Engineering breached the turnkey contract by building a plant well in excess of the contracted for capacity.  Miller Hydro claims that Combustion Engineering has forfeited its right to challenge those findings by failing to \"appeal\" from the jury verdict;  Combustion Engineering replies that appeals are from judgments, not findings, and that it has appealed the judgment rejecting its contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that in this case the jury findings do not settle the propriety of the directed verdict.  The jury verdict might insulate the directed verdict if the jury in deciding the counterclaims had independently reached the same conclusion on the same issue.  But here the trial judge, in submitting the counterclaims to the jury, instructed the jury that as a matter of law \"the turnkey contract required the construction of a hydroelectric facility.... designed to accommodate a maximum hydraulic flow of 7800 cubic feet per second.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central theme of Combustion Engineering's argument on appeal is that the contract did not make 7800 cfs a maximum figure. We think it would be odd to uphold the directed verdict on the ground that the jury found the same thing as the district judge (namely, that the 7800 cfs figure was a ceiling) when in fact the district judge told it to do so.  This is not to say that the district court erred in so instructing the jury--on the contrary, we agree with its reading of the contract--but rather to explain why we think that the directed verdict decision by the district court is not insulated by the jury verdict and should be reviewed on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, the first issue before us in relation to the directed verdict is whether the testing protocol required that the final acceptance test be conducted at a maximum of 7800 cfs.  Although formally this is a separate issue from whether the turnkey contract made 7800 cfs the maximum size for the facility, we think that the reality here is that the two issues are interrelated.  One might be able to read the 7800 cfs figure differently in the test protocol and the contract design specifications, but would be unlikely to do so in this case.  Combustion Engineering treats the two issues together, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court construed the turnkey contract and ruled as a matter of law that the 7800 cfs figure was a target and ceiling figure for both construction and testing of the facility.  As noted above, the 7800 cfs figure does appear in annexed technical specifications although apparently not in the body of the contract itself.  This cross-reference might not be conclusive if it stood alone, but it does not stand alone.  Two other pieces of evidence intrinsic to the contract--the FERC license and the test protocol--support the view that the 7800 cfs figure was both target and ceiling for the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the FERC license was incorporated in the turnkey contract by cross reference, the contractor promising to construct the facility in accordance with the license.  The FERC license refers to the project as having turbines with a total capacity of 14 megawatts, a figure that the turnkey contract treats as a counterpart to the 7800 cfs figure.  As already noted, the turnkey contract refers to 14 megawatts and the annexed technical specifications to 7800 cfs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the test protocol annexed to the turnkey project clearly provided for testing at \"a total flow of 7800 cfs.\"   One can imagine a contract providing for a facility with a large capacity while limiting the test to some lower figure (perhaps the expected normal flow).  Here, however, the reference to the same figure in the technical specifications and in the test protocol strongly suggests as a matter of common sense that the facility was to be built and tested at that figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering's brief argues that the 7800 cfs figure was actually intended as a minimum, urging that the figure be read as akin to other figures in the contract that are allegedly performance minima.  Combustion Engineering also suggests that in any event the 7800 figure was only a rough approximation.  It also argues that the parties contemplated modifications in whatever figure was chosen.  Finally, it claims that Miller Hydro learned of the increase and waived its objection.  Some of these arguments are in tension with others, and none is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be figures in the turnkey contract that are performance minima.  But certainly the normal reading of a performance or capacity figure in a license is that, like the speed limit sign on a highway, it is intended as a maximum.  Here, the contract said that the facility was to be built in accordance with the license, and the license provided for a 14 megawatt facility, a figure that the contract's technical specifications equated to a facility having a capacity of 7800 cfs.  Thus, we think that 7800 cfs was a target and ceiling and not a minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Combustion Engineering's claim that, even treating 7800 cfs as a ceiling, there may be room for minor deviations;  but an increase to over 9000 cfs--there was some testimony that 9600 cfs or more was the real capacity--is hardly a minor change.  Correspondingly, the megawatt capacity increased from 14 megawatts to 18 megawatts or more, hardly a minor adjustment.  The engineer who assisted Combustion Engineering testified that a change from 7800 cfs to 9000 cfs or more would be material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were provisions for modification of the turnkey contract by agreement, but Combustion Engineering has not proved any agreement by Miller Hydro permitting the contractor to exceed the 7800 cfs figure.  As for the claim of waiver or estoppel, that issue was submitted to the jury.  The jury's verdict that Combustion Engineering breached the contract by constructing a facility in excess of 7800 cfs appears implicitly to reject the waiver or estoppel defense.  This is quite understandable since there is no clear evidence that Miller Hydro knew of the change in capacity until it was too late to alter course, and substantial evidence indicates that Combustion Engineering sought to conceal its deviation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering argues that at the very least the contract was ambiguous, so that extrinsic evidence should have been admitted and the issue submitted to a jury.  Some jurisdictions follow the traditional binary rule that an integrated contract is either clear or ambiguous and, in the former case, extrinsic evidence is excluded;  other states follow the so-called modern approach, allowing extrinsic evidence to \"interpret\" even a seemingly unambiguous document.  See A. Farnsworth, Contracts Sec. 7.12, at 521-23 (1990).  But we need not decide in this case precisely how Maine resolves the problem, because Combustion Engineering has not properly pointed to any extrinsic evidence that could alter the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"properly\" pointed because Combustion Engineering's brief does have an entire page of capsule summaries of documents, events or testimony purporting to comprise relevant extrinsic evidence.  In this page of summaries, not a single reference appears to a transcript page or an exhibit number or to an appendix or addendum page.  There is some similar material in the fact statement of the brief, with record or appendix references, and we have sought to match up the summaries with relevant portions of the fact statement.  Having done so as best we can, our conclusion is that this \"evidence,\" even if considered, does not create ambiguities warranting jury resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To take Combustion Engineering's first capsule summary as an example, the brief says that an engineer working for both Combustion Engineering and Miller Hydro told the latter that \"the Turbine Specifications were minimums that did not limit Combustion Engineering's right to select appropriate equipment.\"   The engineer's actual letter, however, merely affirms the contractor's right to design the generator and electrical equipment and says that \"the overall performance expected of the equipment was outlined in the minimum criteria....\"  Nothing in the quotation associates the general reference to minimum criteria with the 7800 cfs figure.  The balance of the evidence summarized by Combustion Engineering is even less persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in its brief, Combustion Engineering makes a quite different argument.  It says that even assuming that a violation of the test protocol occurred, this should not debar Combustion Engineering from all recovery under the contract.  It argues that testing was directed to fixing the efficiency bonus or penalty, and that proper testing should not be found to be a \"condition precedent\" to recovery of other amounts, such as the final payment due under the contract or sums retained temporarily from prior payments.  The company also invokes the notion that \"substantial performance\" is sufficient to allow it to sue on the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be a close question whether standing alone the breach of a testing protocol--among other breaches, Combustion Engineering tested the facility at a flow far greater than 7800 cfs--should preclude recovery of the balance of the contract price as well as the possible bonus.  If this were the posture of the case, we would be obliged to engage in a close reading of the test protocol and its relation to the rest of the contract.  One can certainly conceive of a case in which the contractor failed to fulfil a requirement needed to earn a bonus payment but would not, in ordinary circumstances, be deemed to lose the right to collect the basic price for work done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Combustion Engineering violated not only the test protocol but the contract specifications by building an oversized facility, and the breach was substantial and deliberate.  The jury verdict alone confirms the substantial breach, and its deliberate character is patent from Combustion Engineering's misrepresentations and efforts at concealment.  Even if the violation of the testing protocol did not preclude all further recovery under the contract, assuredly the substantial and deliberate breach did so and precludes a contractual claim based on substantial performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This premise of a substantial and deliberate breach also disposes of Combustion Engineering's equitable claims for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel.  We agree with the district court that, even if such claims may be permitted under Maine law where contractual claims have been lost, Maine law appears to make good faith a condition of such equitably based recoveries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Here Combustion Engineering's good faith is disproved by the jury verdicts.  The verdicts were binding on the court, see Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962), and are amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This outcome becomes even more compelling when one appreciates that the deliberate and substantial breach placed Miller Hydro at risk of significant harm.  There may be cases where building \"more\" than one promised is a benefit to the owner;  but that is hardly assured in the case of a federally licensed dam.  Indeed, it may be that Miller Hydro itself will ultimately suffer because of violation of its federal license terms or because the fish protection facilities will have to be rebuilt.  Nor is it clear that it has gained by obtaining extra power that it says it can neither sell to Central Maine Power nor economically wheel to other customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro alludes to these possibilities without providing much supporting detail.  We have no way of knowing how much substance there is to them, nor whether short term disadvantages may be offset in part, or even outweighed, by the long-term benefits of a larger facility with a greater capacity to produce power.  What we do know is that Combustion Engineering was not entitled to create such risks for Miller Hydro by secretly deviating--substantially and deliberately--from the terms of the contract.  That one behaving in this fashion now forfeits the balance due under the contract does not seem in the least unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering has two remaining arguments that require little discussion.  It first argues that the court should have granted its motion for a retest of the facility in accordance with the protocol.  This demand was made not only after Combustion Engineering had turned down Miller Hydro's own request for retest, but after the directed verdict and the jury verdict in this case.  The district court's refusal to grant this highly belated, if not impudent, request for equitable relief was well within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other argument is Combustion Engineering's attack on the district court's refusal to grant it relief under the Maine mechanic's lien statute.  It may be an oversimplification to say that the statute creates only an additional remedy and not a new right;  but it is clear that under Maine law, as in many jurisdictions, the mechanic's lien depends on the claimant having a valid underlying claim for monetary recovery based on the construction performed.  Bangor Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Robbins Plumbing Co., 151 Me. 145, 116 A.2d 664, 666 (1955).  Combustion Engineering has no such valid underlying claim in this case, so the district court properly discharged the mechanic's lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains Miller Hydro's own appeal.  As already noted, the jury found (in deciding Miller Hydro's counterclaims) that Combustion Engineering had breached its contract and engaged in misrepresentation but that the proof did not support a finding of damages from the breach or falsehoods.  Miller Hydro does not challenge these verdicts, which limited its judgment on these claims to declaratory relief.  Rather, it argues that the district court erred by dismissing its remaining racketeering counterclaim and declining to submit that claim to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining counterclaim comprised three related counts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961, et seq.  (\"RICO\").  In substance, these RICO counts, asserted in a pleadings amendment, charged Combustion Engineering and various of its employees with a fraudulent scheme to obtain inflated bonuses from one or more power-plant construction projects.  Various uses of the mails or telephone system in aid of the fraudulent scheme were alleged.  For the RICO violations, Miller Hydro sought damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the RICO counts were added, Combustion Engineering on April 16, 1991, moved to dismiss the counts under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim;  it asserted as grounds for dismissal various somewhat technical defects in the RICO counterclaims (e.g., that a separate \"enterprise\" had not been sufficiently alleged).  On October 4, 1991, the district court granted the motion to dismiss but on a ground only barely suggested by a footnote in the motion, namely, that an earlier, October 19, 1990, discovery order by the magistrate judge had found a failure of Miller Hydro to make out a prima facie case of fraud by Combustion Engineering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's order had been entered in resolving discovery disputes including Miller Hydro's claim that Combustion Engineering had lost the protection of the attorney client privilege as to certain materials because its attorney was participating in a fraudulent scheme.  Interpreting Maine law governing the privilege, see Me.R.Evid. 502(d)(1), the magistrate judge found that Miller Hydro's evidence thus far made out the necessary prima facie case on \"the first three elements of fraud [knowing or reckless misrepresentation of a material fact] but not the final two [purpose and effect of inducing reliance].\"  Absent sufficient proof of each element needed to prove fraud, the magistrate judge found no loss of the privilege and refused to order protection of the documents in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Miller Hydro complains sharply that in resolving the Rule 12(b)(6) motion the district judge had no right to rely on materials beyond the pleadings without giving Miller Hydro notice and an opportunity to counter the extra-pleading material.  Although Rule 12(b)(6) does require \"a reasonable opportunity\" to counter material outside the pleadings, the magistrate judge's finding of no prima facie case was cited in Combustion Engineering's motion to dismiss and arguably Miller Hydro had the necessary opportunity to counter it.  This court has looked through form to substance in applying the rule's requirement.  See Moody v. Town of Weymouth, 805 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more troublesome is Miller Hydro's further, substantive argument that the magistrate judge's finding cannot support the district court's order dismissing the RICO claims.  All that the finding showed, says Miller Hydro, is that in October 1990, while discovery was still underway, it lacked enough evidence to show that all elements of fraud had been made out to the extent needed to vitiate the attorney client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Even assuming that the standards are the same for proving fraud in relation to the attorney-client privilege issue and in relation to a RICO claim, it does not follow that evidence was equally lacking in October 1991 after further discovery had been conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not discuss any of the evidence in its brief order of dismissal in October 1991.  Further, the court actually allowed the Maine fraud claims made by Miller Hydro to go the jury.  Yet common alleged acts of fraud underlay both the Maine fraud and the RICO fraud counts.  Indeed, Miller Hydro argues that RICO fraud is easier to prove than fraud under Maine law because the latter requires that each element be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  The district court's seeming concession that there was enough evidence of fraud under Maine law adds to doubts whether we could sustain the court's dismissal of the RICO counts based on the magistrate judge's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the matter, however, because the jury's verdict taken together with other circumstances persuades us that Miller Hydro was not prejudiced by the dismissal of the RICO claims.  The jury found that no damages had been proved by Miller Hydro on the two counterclaims that did reach the jury even though the jury found both breach of contract by Combustion Engineering and acts amounting to fraud.  The central damage claims argued to the jury by Miller Hydro--e.g., delay costs, prospective rebuilding of the fishways--are common to the Maine fraud and RICO fraud claims, and the jury finding of no damages on the former suggests the same outcome would have resulted on the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro argues, although without much detail, that its damage claims based on breach of contract were somewhat narrower than those covered by fraud.  Its theory is that contract damages must be within the contemplation of the parties but fraud damages need not be, and we will assume that this is so.  But Miller Hydro does not suggest (attorney's fees aside) that its actual damages for fraud were narrower under Maine law than under RICO and, given the common acts of alleged fraud, it is hard to see why the damage claims under RICO would be broader.  Instead, Miller Hydro simply asserts that the fraud damage claims under Maine law required clear and convincing evidence while those under RICO required merely a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by no means clear that the jury was told that the fraud damages under Maine law had to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  But even if the jury had been explicitly told clear and convincing evidence was required in computing damages, we would still find no showing of prejudice in this case.  Perhaps where the issue of damages is shown to be very close--turning, for instance, on a clash of expert opinions--the asserted difference in burden of proof between a common law fraud and a civil RICO claim could be decisive.  See Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, 815 F.2d 522, 531 (9th Cir.1987).  But the burden of showing prejudice is upon the party claiming error, and we think that here that burden has not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro's main efforts at trial appear to have been devoted to establishing Combustion Engineering's breach of contract and fraud, findings very important in shoring up Miller Hydro's own defense to Combustion Engineering's claims against it.  After a directed verdict was served, Miller Hydro chose to present no case in chief of its own in support of its own counterclaims.  Instead, Miller Hydro relied upon the evidence that Combustion Engineering had offered in its own case in chief before the directed verdict was granted.  It is not surprising that, absent an affirmative independent showing as to how Miller Hydro would suffer from the larger facility, the jury awarded no damages.  Miller Hydro's decision to stop while ahead was probably good tactics, but it does not suggest that an adjustment in the burden of proof would have altered the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important, there is nothing in Miller Hydro's reply brief--which offers the burden of proof distinction as the basis for presuming prejudice--that discusses the evidence of damages in any detail or provides any basis for believing that a different standard of proof could alter the result in this case.  In the present circumstances, including the nature of the jury instructions and the seemingly limited weight placed on damages at trial, we think that the theoretical possibility of a different result is not enough.  And absent a showing that would suggest a real possibility of a different result, it is time for this already lengthy litigation to come to an end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered consequential damages, it remains to address two other possible differences in remedy.  First, the RICO statute allows attorney's fees to a person \"injured in his business or property\" by a RICO violation.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c).  It is far from clear, however, that such attorney's fees would be available where, as here, the jury finds that no actual injury has been proved.  Again, given the absence of some showing by Miller Hydro that a jury could award damages limited solely to attorney's fees, we think that no showing of prejudice has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Miller Hydro argues that under RICO it would have been entitled to injunctive relief that remains of continuing importance to it.  Specifically, it asserts that Combustion Engineering, having had its belated motion for a retest denied by the district court, is now trying (how is not explained) to pursue its demand for a retest through other means.  This conduct, says Miller Hydro, constitutes continuing RICO fraud that the district court would have been asked to enjoin if the RICO claims had not been dismissed.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(a) (injunctive remedy available under RICO).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is too thin a reed on which to hang a remand and further litigation under RICO.  Taken together, the district court's dismissal of Combustion Engineering's contract and equitable claims and the court's denial of the belated motion for a retest establish definitively that Combustion Engineering has no further claim for a retest or any other remedy under the turnkey contract.  If Combustion Engineering were to pursue any such claim through an independent law suit, we think that sanctions for baseless litigation might well be available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case could plausibly have been settled at the outset by, for example, payment of any remaining amounts due under the contract but without any bonus payment.  Now, after wearisome and no doubt expensive litigation over an imperfect contract and imperfect conduct, neither side has gained what it sought at the outset.  This may itself be a form of justice, but it could have been achieved at a lower price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

In the ensuing litigation, neither the builder, Combustion Engineering, Inc., nor the owner, Miller Hydro Group, succeeded in recovering against the other.  Both appeal.  We affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980's, Miller Hydro set about creating a hydroelectric facility on the Androscoggin River near Lisbon Falls, Maine, to generate electricity.  It first negotiated a contract with Central Maine Power Company by which the latter agreed to purchase a set amount of power from the planned facility.  Miller Hydro also obtained financing from a Finnish bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, and a license to build the project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1986, Miller Hydro entered into a contract--the central document at issue in this case--with Combustion Engineering for the latter to build the facility on a \"turnkey\" basis.  The turnkey contract, by cross-reference, provided for a facility including turbines with a capacity of 7800 cubic feet of water per second.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Under its contract with Maine Central Power, Miller Hydro was expected to provide power capacity of 14 megawatts, and the Miller Hydro contract with Combustion Engineering also referred to this requirement by cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject to these and other specifications, it was entirely up to Combustion Engineering to design and build the new facility.  The turnkey contract contained incentive and penalty provisions, one of which lies at the heart of this case.  The price set for construction was fixed at just under $24 million, but the contract provided that Combustion Engineering would earn a sliding-scale bonus for efficiency to the extent that the facility produced power in excess of 77,500 megawatt hours per year;  a corresponding penalty provision reduced Combustion Engineering's fixed price to the extent that the facility was less efficient than a specified minimum output of 73,500 megawatt hours per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The turnkey contract provided that the bonus or penalty would be determined by certain tests that would be performed by an independent tester at the completion of construction.  A protocol specified how the test would be conducted, including a requirement that the facility be tested at a \"total flow of 7800 cfs.\"   It also permitted Miller Hydro to require a retest by a different tester if it were dissatisfied with the initial test.  It appears that if Combustion Engineering had built a highly efficient plant of the size specified, Miller Hydro might have been liable for a bonus payment as large as $850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What happened instead is that Combustion Engineering built a far larger plant with turbines having a maximum flow capacity of over 9000 cfs or more and a power capacity of 18 to 19 megawatts.  Miller Hydro claims that this increase in size was done deliberately and secretly by Combustion Engineering in order to manipulate the bonus provisions of the construction contract.  Miller Hydro and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki both say that they did not learn of the increase until it was too late to modify the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the facility was tested at a total flow of 9000 or more cfs, the tester reported results that equated to a bonus of over $8 million.  In Miller Hydro's view, Combustion Engineering had invested $1 million or so of its own money in increasing the facility's size in order to reap a ten-fold increase in the incentive bonus.  Miller Hydro also objected to the test itself and invoked its right to a retest.  It also refused to state its \"final acceptance\" of the facility, or to make final construction payments.  Instead of agreeing to a retest, Combustion Engineering promptly brought suit against Miller Hydro in district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint Combustion Engineering set forth claims based on contract, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel, and it sought to enforce a mechanic's lien against the facility.  As damages, it demanded an incentive bonus of $8.16 million, a final construction payment of $45,364, a further payment of $1,236,427 in amounts withheld from prior payments, and a claimed early completion bonus of $893,894.  Kansallis-Osake-Pankki intervened, arguing that Combustion Engineering had by contract subordinated its rights under the mechanic's lien statute to the bank's mortgage on the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro counterclaimed against Combustion Engineering asserting contract, fraud, and racketeering claims.  Miller Hydro tells us that Central Maine Power has not agreed to buy the extra power that the facility can generate and that Miller Hydro will or may incur additional costs as a result of the facility's enlarged size.  In particular, it says that it may face penalties from FERC for building a facility larger than the license permits, and that it may have to reconstruct fish-protection facilities that were keyed to the originally planned smaller turbines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case presented both legal and equitable claims, the district court bifurcated the trial.  In the first phase, Combustion Engineering tried its contract claims to the jury and Miller Hydro tried its contract and fraud counterclaims to the same jury.  (Miller Hydro's racketeering counterclaim was dismissed by the court in circumstances recounted below.)   In the second phase the trial judge proposed to rule himself on Combustion Engineering's equitable claims (unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel) and to resolve any outstanding issues concerning the mechanic's lien claim, including priority as between Combustion Engineering and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Combustion Engineering presented its case in chief to the jury, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law against Combustion Engineering on its contract claims.  The court held that Combustion Engineering had materially breached its contract in testing the facility at a total flow in excess of 7800 cfs and in other departures from the test protocol.  The court found it unnecessary to reach Miller Hydro's argument that the refusal of Combustion Engineering to agree to a retest was also a breach of contract that barred recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro's own contract and fraud counterclaims against Combustion Engineering were submitted to the jury together with a special verdict form.  On January 23, 1992, the jury returned its verdict, finding that Combustion Engineering had breached the contract by designing the facility for a maximum flow in excess of 7800 cfs, and not in accordance with the FERC license.  It found the actual maximum flow to be at least 9000 cfs and the power output capacity to be 18 megawatts.  It also found that Combustion Engineering had provided materially false information to Miller Hydro.  Nevertheless, the jury awarded no damages to Miller Hydro either for breach of contract or fraud, finding (in response to special verdict questions) that Miller Hydro had not proved damages from the breach of contract or the misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1992, the trial judge filed a decision denying Combustion Engineering recovery on its equitable claims.  The court held that under Maine law material breaches of contract did not automatically preclude an equitable recovery but that the plaintiff's good faith effort to perform was a prerequisite;  and the court ruled that Combustion Engineering \"did not seek in good faith to meet its obligations under the turnkey contract,\" given the deliberate breaches and misrepresentations found by the jury.  The jury findings, the court said, were binding on the court in deciding the equitable claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, the trial judge denied a motion by Combustion Engineering requesting the court to order a retesting of the facility, to appoint a special master, and to allow the filing of a supplemental complaint.  The court ruled that this motion, filed on June 3, 1992, well after the jury verdict, came too late.  Not only had extensive discovery been conducted but the jury trial had already been held and the case was nearing completion.  Further delay, said the court, would be unfair to both of the other parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by decision entered on December 22, 1992, the trial judge ruled on Combustion Engineering's mechanic's lien claim.  It rejected the claim on the ground that enforcement of such a lien required a valid underlying claim and that Combustion Engineering had been found to lack such a valid claim.  The court granted Kansallis-Osake-Pankki's request to discharge the mechanic's lien.  It also granted Miller Hydro's requests, made in its counterclaims, for declarations of breach of contract and misrepresentation by Combustion Engineering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1993, the court entered final judgment in the case.  Combustion Engineering has appealed the directed verdict against it on its contract claims, and the denial of its equitable claims, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span>, its mechanics lien claim, and its motion to retest.  Miller Hydro has appealed the earlier dismissal of its racketeering counterclaim.  Neither side has explicitly sought to disturb the judgment on Miller Hydro's contract and fraud counterclaims entered upon the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering advances a series of different arguments on appeal, variously involving the directed verdict against it on its contract claims, the dismissal of its equitable claims, the district court's refusal to order a retest, and the ruling discharging the mechanic's lien.  We begin with these issues, reserving for the end a discussion of Miller Hydro's cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering's first, and most extensively briefed, point on appeal is its attack on the district court's grant of a directed verdict--now renamed judgment as a matter of law, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)--dismissing Combustion Engineering's contract claims against Miller Hydro.  We review such a dismissal de novo, asking whether on the evidence presented a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff.  Murray v. Ross-Dove Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"653617\"><a href=\"/opinion/653617/john-p-murray-v-ross-dove-company-inc-and-dovetech-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir.1993).  In considering this question, it is assumed that issues of credibility are resolved, and inferences from evidence drawn, in favor of the non-moving party.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold one might think that the attack on the directed verdict is barred by the jury's subsequent findings.  These findings, on Miller Hydro's counterclaims, establish that Combustion Engineering breached the turnkey contract by building a plant well in excess of the contracted for capacity.  Miller Hydro claims that Combustion Engineering has forfeited its right to challenge those findings by failing to \"appeal\" from the jury verdict;  Combustion Engineering replies that appeals are from judgments, not findings, and that it has appealed the judgment rejecting its contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that in this case the jury findings do not settle the propriety of the directed verdict.  The jury verdict might insulate the directed verdict if the jury in deciding the counterclaims had independently reached the same conclusion on the same issue.  But here the trial judge, in submitting the counterclaims to the jury, instructed the jury that as a matter of law \"the turnkey contract required the construction of a hydroelectric facility.... designed to accommodate a maximum hydraulic flow of 7800 cubic feet per second.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central theme of Combustion Engineering's argument on appeal is that the contract did not make 7800 cfs a maximum figure. We think it would be odd to uphold the directed verdict on the ground that the jury found the same thing as the district judge (namely, that the 7800 cfs figure was a ceiling) when in fact the district judge told it to do so.  This is not to say that the district court erred in so instructing the jury--on the contrary, we agree with its reading of the contract--but rather to explain why we think that the directed verdict decision by the district court is not insulated by the jury verdict and should be reviewed on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, the first issue before us in relation to the directed verdict is whether the testing protocol required that the final acceptance test be conducted at a maximum of 7800 cfs.  Although formally this is a separate issue from whether the turnkey contract made 7800 cfs the maximum size for the facility, we think that the reality here is that the two issues are interrelated.  One might be able to read the 7800 cfs figure differently in the test protocol and the contract design specifications, but would be unlikely to do so in this case.  Combustion Engineering treats the two issues together, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court construed the turnkey contract and ruled as a matter of law that the 7800 cfs figure was a target and ceiling figure for both construction and testing of the facility.  As noted above, the 7800 cfs figure does appear in annexed technical specifications although apparently not in the body of the contract itself.  This cross-reference might not be conclusive if it stood alone, but it does not stand alone.  Two other pieces of evidence intrinsic to the contract--the FERC license and the test protocol--support the view that the 7800 cfs figure was both target and ceiling for the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the FERC license was incorporated in the turnkey contract by cross reference, the contractor promising to construct the facility in accordance with the license.  The FERC license refers to the project as having turbines with a total capacity of 14 megawatts, a figure that the turnkey contract treats as a counterpart to the 7800 cfs figure.  As already noted, the turnkey contract refers to 14 megawatts and the annexed technical specifications to 7800 cfs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the test protocol annexed to the turnkey project clearly provided for testing at \"a total flow of 7800 cfs.\"   One can imagine a contract providing for a facility with a large capacity while limiting the test to some lower figure (perhaps the expected normal flow).  Here, however, the reference to the same figure in the technical specifications and in the test protocol strongly suggests as a matter of common sense that the facility was to be built and tested at that figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering's brief argues that the 7800 cfs figure was actually intended as a minimum, urging that the figure be read as akin to other figures in the contract that are allegedly performance minima.  Combustion Engineering also suggests that in any event the 7800 figure was only a rough approximation.  It also argues that the parties contemplated modifications in whatever figure was chosen.  Finally, it claims that Miller Hydro learned of the increase and waived its objection.  Some of these arguments are in tension with others, and none is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be figures in the turnkey contract that are performance minima.  But certainly the normal reading of a performance or capacity figure in a license is that, like the speed limit sign on a highway, it is intended as a maximum.  Here, the contract said that the facility was to be built in accordance with the license, and the license provided for a 14 megawatt facility, a figure that the contract's technical specifications equated to a facility having a capacity of 7800 cfs.  Thus, we think that 7800 cfs was a target and ceiling and not a minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Combustion Engineering's claim that, even treating 7800 cfs as a ceiling, there may be room for minor deviations;  but an increase to over 9000 cfs--there was some testimony that 9600 cfs or more was the real capacity--is hardly a minor change.  Correspondingly, the megawatt capacity increased from 14 megawatts to 18 megawatts or more, hardly a minor adjustment.  The engineer who assisted Combustion Engineering testified that a change from 7800 cfs to 9000 cfs or more would be material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were provisions for modification of the turnkey contract by agreement, but Combustion Engineering has not proved any agreement by Miller Hydro permitting the contractor to exceed the 7800 cfs figure.  As for the claim of waiver or estoppel, that issue was submitted to the jury.  The jury's verdict that Combustion Engineering breached the contract by constructing a facility in excess of 7800 cfs appears implicitly to reject the waiver or estoppel defense.  This is quite understandable since there is no clear evidence that Miller Hydro knew of the change in capacity until it was too late to alter course, and substantial evidence indicates that Combustion Engineering sought to conceal its deviation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering argues that at the very least the contract was ambiguous, so that extrinsic evidence should have been admitted and the issue submitted to a jury.  Some jurisdictions follow the traditional binary rule that an integrated contract is either clear or ambiguous and, in the former case, extrinsic evidence is excluded;  other states follow the so-called modern approach, allowing extrinsic evidence to \"interpret\" even a seemingly unambiguous document.  See A. Farnsworth, Contracts Sec. 7.12, at 521-23 (1990).  But we need not decide in this case precisely how Maine resolves the problem, because Combustion Engineering has not properly pointed to any extrinsic evidence that could alter the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"properly\" pointed because Combustion Engineering's brief does have an entire page of capsule summaries of documents, events or testimony purporting to comprise relevant extrinsic evidence.  In this page of summaries, not a single reference appears to a transcript page or an exhibit number or to an appendix or addendum page.  There is some similar material in the fact statement of the brief, with record or appendix references, and we have sought to match up the summaries with relevant portions of the fact statement.  Having done so as best we can, our conclusion is that this \"evidence,\" even if considered, does not create ambiguities warranting jury resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To take Combustion Engineering's first capsule summary as an example, the brief says that an engineer working for both Combustion Engineering and Miller Hydro told the latter that \"the Turbine Specifications were minimums that did not limit Combustion Engineering's right to select appropriate equipment.\"   The engineer's actual letter, however, merely affirms the contractor's right to design the generator and electrical equipment and says that \"the overall performance expected of the equipment was outlined in the minimum criteria....\"  Nothing in the quotation associates the general reference to minimum criteria with the 7800 cfs figure.  The balance of the evidence summarized by Combustion Engineering is even less persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in its brief, Combustion Engineering makes a quite different argument.  It says that even assuming that a violation of the test protocol occurred, this should not debar Combustion Engineering from all recovery under the contract.  It argues that testing was directed to fixing the efficiency bonus or penalty, and that proper testing should not be found to be a \"condition precedent\" to recovery of other amounts, such as the final payment due under the contract or sums retained temporarily from prior payments.  The company also invokes the notion that \"substantial performance\" is sufficient to allow it to sue on the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be a close question whether standing alone the breach of a testing protocol--among other breaches, Combustion Engineering tested the facility at a flow far greater than 7800 cfs--should preclude recovery of the balance of the contract price as well as the possible bonus.  If this were the posture of the case, we would be obliged to engage in a close reading of the test protocol and its relation to the rest of the contract.  One can certainly conceive of a case in which the contractor failed to fulfil a requirement needed to earn a bonus payment but would not, in ordinary circumstances, be deemed to lose the right to collect the basic price for work done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Combustion Engineering violated not only the test protocol but the contract specifications by building an oversized facility, and the breach was substantial and deliberate.  The jury verdict alone confirms the substantial breach, and its deliberate character is patent from Combustion Engineering's misrepresentations and efforts at concealment.  Even if the violation of the testing protocol did not preclude all further recovery under the contract, assuredly the substantial and deliberate breach did so and precludes a contractual claim based on substantial performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This premise of a substantial and deliberate breach also disposes of Combustion Engineering's equitable claims for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel.  We agree with the district court that, even if such claims may be permitted under Maine law where contractual claims have been lost, Maine law appears to make good faith a condition of such equitably based recoveries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Here Combustion Engineering's good faith is disproved by the jury verdicts.  The verdicts were binding on the court, see Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106385\"><a href=\"/opinion/106385/dairy-queen-inc-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106385\"><a href=\"/opinion/106385/dairy-queen-inc-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106385\"><a href=\"/opinion/106385/dairy-queen-inc-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span> (1962), and are amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This outcome becomes even more compelling when one appreciates that the deliberate and substantial breach placed Miller Hydro at risk of significant harm.  There may be cases where building \"more\" than one promised is a benefit to the owner;  but that is hardly assured in the case of a federally licensed dam.  Indeed, it may be that Miller Hydro itself will ultimately suffer because of violation of its federal license terms or because the fish protection facilities will have to be rebuilt.  Nor is it clear that it has gained by obtaining extra power that it says it can neither sell to Central Maine Power nor economically wheel to other customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro alludes to these possibilities without providing much supporting detail.  We have no way of knowing how much substance there is to them, nor whether short term disadvantages may be offset in part, or even outweighed, by the long-term benefits of a larger facility with a greater capacity to produce power.  What we do know is that Combustion Engineering was not entitled to create such risks for Miller Hydro by secretly deviating--substantially and deliberately--from the terms of the contract.  That one behaving in this fashion now forfeits the balance due under the contract does not seem in the least unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Combustion Engineering has two remaining arguments that require little discussion.  It first argues that the court should have granted its motion for a retest of the facility in accordance with the protocol.  This demand was made not only after Combustion Engineering had turned down Miller Hydro's own request for retest, but after the directed verdict and the jury verdict in this case.  The district court's refusal to grant this highly belated, if not impudent, request for equitable relief was well within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other argument is Combustion Engineering's attack on the district court's refusal to grant it relief under the Maine mechanic's lien statute.  It may be an oversimplification to say that the statute creates only an additional remedy and not a new right;  but it is clear that under Maine law, as in many jurisdictions, the mechanic's lien depends on the claimant having a valid underlying claim for monetary recovery based on the construction performed.  Bangor Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Robbins Plumbing Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2316292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2316292/bangor-roofing-sheet-metal-co-v-robbins-plumb-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 666 (1955).  Combustion Engineering has no such valid underlying claim in this case, so the district court properly discharged the mechanic's lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains Miller Hydro's own appeal.  As already noted, the jury found (in deciding Miller Hydro's counterclaims) that Combustion Engineering had breached its contract and engaged in misrepresentation but that the proof did not support a finding of damages from the breach or falsehoods.  Miller Hydro does not challenge these verdicts, which limited its judgment on these claims to declaratory relief.  Rather, it argues that the district court erred by dismissing its remaining racketeering counterclaim and declining to submit that claim to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining counterclaim comprised three related counts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961, et seq.  (\"RICO\").  In substance, these RICO counts, asserted in a pleadings amendment, charged Combustion Engineering and various of its employees with a fraudulent scheme to obtain inflated bonuses from one or more power-plant construction projects.  Various uses of the mails or telephone system in aid of the fraudulent scheme were alleged.  For the RICO violations, Miller Hydro sought damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the RICO counts were added, Combustion Engineering on April 16, 1991, moved to dismiss the counts under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim;  it asserted as grounds for dismissal various somewhat technical defects in the RICO counterclaims (e.g., that a separate \"enterprise\" had not been sufficiently alleged).  On October 4, 1991, the district court granted the motion to dismiss but on a ground only barely suggested by a footnote in the motion, namely, that an earlier, October 19, 1990, discovery order by the magistrate judge had found a failure of Miller Hydro to make out a prima facie case of fraud by Combustion Engineering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's order had been entered in resolving discovery disputes including Miller Hydro's claim that Combustion Engineering had lost the protection of the attorney client privilege as to certain materials because its attorney was participating in a fraudulent scheme.  Interpreting Maine law governing the privilege, see Me.R.Evid. 502(d)(1), the magistrate judge found that Miller Hydro's evidence thus far made out the necessary prima facie case on \"the first three elements of fraud [knowing or reckless misrepresentation of a material fact] but not the final two [purpose and effect of inducing reliance].\"  Absent sufficient proof of each element needed to prove fraud, the magistrate judge found no loss of the privilege and refused to order protection of the documents in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Miller Hydro complains sharply that in resolving the Rule 12(b)(6) motion the district judge had no right to rely on materials beyond the pleadings without giving Miller Hydro notice and an opportunity to counter the extra-pleading material.  Although Rule 12(b)(6) does require \"a reasonable opportunity\" to counter material outside the pleadings, the magistrate judge's finding of no prima facie case was cited in Combustion Engineering's motion to dismiss and arguably Miller Hydro had the necessary opportunity to counter it.  This court has looked through form to substance in applying the rule's requirement.  See Moody v. Town of Weymouth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479206\"><a href=\"/opinion/479206/richard-m-moody-v-town-of-weymouth/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more troublesome is Miller Hydro's further, substantive argument that the magistrate judge's finding cannot support the district court's order dismissing the RICO claims.  All that the finding showed, says Miller Hydro, is that in October 1990, while discovery was still underway, it lacked enough evidence to show that all elements of fraud had been made out to the extent needed to vitiate the attorney client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Even assuming that the standards are the same for proving fraud in relation to the attorney-client privilege issue and in relation to a RICO claim, it does not follow that evidence was equally lacking in October 1991 after further discovery had been conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not discuss any of the evidence in its brief order of dismissal in October 1991.  Further, the court actually allowed the Maine fraud claims made by Miller Hydro to go the jury.  Yet common alleged acts of fraud underlay both the Maine fraud and the RICO fraud counts.  Indeed, Miller Hydro argues that RICO fraud is easier to prove than fraud under Maine law because the latter requires that each element be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  The district court's seeming concession that there was enough evidence of fraud under Maine law adds to doubts whether we could sustain the court's dismissal of the RICO counts based on the magistrate judge's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the matter, however, because the jury's verdict taken together with other circumstances persuades us that Miller Hydro was not prejudiced by the dismissal of the RICO claims.  The jury found that no damages had been proved by Miller Hydro on the two counterclaims that did reach the jury even though the jury found both breach of contract by Combustion Engineering and acts amounting to fraud.  The central damage claims argued to the jury by Miller Hydro--e.g., delay costs, prospective rebuilding of the fishways--are common to the Maine fraud and RICO fraud claims, and the jury finding of no damages on the former suggests the same outcome would have resulted on the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro argues, although without much detail, that its damage claims based on breach of contract were somewhat narrower than those covered by fraud.  Its theory is that contract damages must be within the contemplation of the parties but fraud damages need not be, and we will assume that this is so.  But Miller Hydro does not suggest (attorney's fees aside) that its actual damages for fraud were narrower under Maine law than under RICO and, given the common acts of alleged fraud, it is hard to see why the damage claims under RICO would be broader.  Instead, Miller Hydro simply asserts that the fraud damage claims under Maine law required clear and convincing evidence while those under RICO required merely a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by no means clear that the jury was told that the fraud damages under Maine law had to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  But even if the jury had been explicitly told clear and convincing evidence was required in computing damages, we would still find no showing of prejudice in this case.  Perhaps where the issue of damages is shown to be very close--turning, for instance, on a clash of expert opinions--the asserted difference in burden of proof between a common law fraud and a civil RICO claim could be decisive.  See Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485705\"><a href=\"/opinion/485705/glen-l-wilcox-lorraine-wilcox-wilcox-development-company-mid-willamette/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 531 (9th Cir.1987).  But the burden of showing prejudice is upon the party claiming error, and we think that here that burden has not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller Hydro's main efforts at trial appear to have been devoted to establishing Combustion Engineering's breach of contract and fraud, findings very important in shoring up Miller Hydro's own defense to Combustion Engineering's claims against it.  After a directed verdict was served, Miller Hydro chose to present no case in chief of its own in support of its own counterclaims.  Instead, Miller Hydro relied upon the evidence that Combustion Engineering had offered in its own case in chief before the directed verdict was granted.  It is not surprising that, absent an affirmative independent showing as to how Miller Hydro would suffer from the larger facility, the jury awarded no damages.  Miller Hydro's decision to stop while ahead was probably good tactics, but it does not suggest that an adjustment in the burden of proof would have altered the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important, there is nothing in Miller Hydro's reply brief--which offers the burden of proof distinction as the basis for presuming prejudice--that discusses the evidence of damages in any detail or provides any basis for believing that a different standard of proof could alter the result in this case.  In the present circumstances, including the nature of the jury instructions and the seemingly limited weight placed on damages at trial, we think that the theoretical possibility of a different result is not enough.  And absent a showing that would suggest a real possibility of a different result, it is time for this already lengthy litigation to come to an end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered consequential damages, it remains to address two other possible differences in remedy.  First, the RICO statute allows attorney's fees to a person \"injured in his business or property\" by a RICO violation.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c).  It is far from clear, however, that such attorney's fees would be available where, as here, the jury finds that no actual injury has been proved.  Again, given the absence of some showing by Miller Hydro that a jury could award damages limited solely to attorney's fees, we think that no showing of prejudice has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Miller Hydro argues that under RICO it would have been entitled to injunctive relief that remains of continuing importance to it.  Specifically, it asserts that Combustion Engineering, having had its belated motion for a retest denied by the district court, is now trying (how is not explained) to pursue its demand for a retest through other means.  This conduct, says Miller Hydro, constitutes continuing RICO fraud that the district court would have been asked to enjoin if the RICO claims had not been dismissed.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(a) (injunctive remedy available under RICO).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is too thin a reed on which to hang a remand and further litigation under RICO.  Taken together, the district court's dismissal of Combustion Engineering's contract and equitable claims and the court's denial of the belated motion for a retest establish definitively that Combustion Engineering has no further claim for a retest or any other remedy under the turnkey contract.  If Combustion Engineering were to pursue any such claim through an independent law suit, we think that sanctions for baseless litigation might well be available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case could plausibly have been settled at the outset by, for example, payment of any remaining amounts due under the contract but without any bonus payment.  Now, after wearisome and no doubt expensive litigation over an imperfect contract and imperfect conduct, neither side has gained what it sought at the outset.  This may itself be a form of justice, but it could have been achieved at a lower price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

A shorter and more general \"project description,\" also annexed, refers to turbine discharge capacity of \"approximately 8,000\" cfs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court also told the jury that the court itself had rejected Combustion Engineering's contract claims because the court had found (in directing a verdict) a material breach of contract by Combustion Engineering, namely, its failure to show compliance \"with the testing requirement of testing at a total flow of 7800 cfs\" as required by the protocol annexed to the turnkey contract</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There was also evidence that the license application initially reflected a flow of 6800 cfs and that approval of FERC to increase this to 7800 was obtained in 1985.  However, there is some doubt that this evidence could be described as intrinsic, at least in the form submitted, and we do not rely upon it to sustain the directed verdict</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The most recent Maine decision to which we are cited, says that an equitable recovery may be allowed when the builder provided materials or services \"in an honest endeavor\" to perform the contract.

Even if Maine law is more fluid, allowing the judge some flexibility in weighing the equities, see A. Horton &amp; P. McGehee, Maine Civil Remedies, 11-17 (2d ed. 1992), we are certain from its statements here that the district court would exercise that discretion to disallow recovery, and we would have no difficulty sustaining that decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The standard of proof is rather elusive since a prima facie case does not require definitive proof;  yet the fraud claim itself has to be proved under Maine law by clear and convincing evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court's generally lucid instructions did tell the jury that the elements of fraud under Maine law had to be established by clear and convincing evidence.  But when the court came to instructing on the computation of damages, where it discussed contract and fraud damages together, it did not say that any of these determinations had to be made by clear and convincing evidence.  Indeed, the jury could easily have inferred the contrary because the court went on to say that an award of exemplary damages did require a finding of malice by clear and convincing evidence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
