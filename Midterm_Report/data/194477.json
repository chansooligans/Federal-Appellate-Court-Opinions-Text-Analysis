On August 4, 1991,\n\nPatrolman Robert Brown, Jr.,  responded to a reported disturbance\n\nat the  Hot Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  After assisting in\n\nresolving  the dispute, Officer Brown  was told by  a patron that\n\nanother  disturbance had broken out  between two men  in a nearby\n\nparking  lot.   As  Brown approached  the  parking lot,  a  woman\n\nstanding  near him  screamed:   \"That  man has  a gun!\"   In  the\n\ndirection indicated by the woman, the officer saw appellant Smith\n\nstanding alone, and other people running away from Smith.\n\n          The officer  approached appellant and told  him to drop\n\nthe  gun.  Smith held out his  palms, which were empty, and said,\n\n\"I ain't  got no gun,\" then  turned and ran.   Officer Brown gave\n\nchase  and  radioed for  assistance.    Following a  two-to-three\n\nminute chase,  covering one-quarter  to one-half mile,  Smith was\n\napprehended;  an  unloaded  .25  caliber  automatic  handgun  was\n\nremoved from  his waistband.   Appellant's sole defense  at trial\n\nwasthathispossessionofthe firearmwasjustifiedinthe circumstances.\n\n          According  to his  own  testimony,  appellant had  been\n\nstanding outside the  club when  another man said  to him:   \"Hey\n\nJoe, I've got your f'ing girlfriend.\"  Turning  around, appellant\n\nsaw a  man,  whom  he identified  as  George  Sacco,  restraining\n\nappellant's girlfriend, Deirdre Machado, and holding a gun to her\n\nside.  Appellant testified that he approached Sacco, who tripped,\n\nand, after they scuffled,  appellant grabbed the gun  from Sacco.\n\nAppellant  testified that it was  Machado who yelled:   \"That man\n\nhas a  gun,\" and  that Machado  had meant that  Sacco had  a gun.\n\nAppellant admitted at  trial that he had denied having a gun when\n\nasked by Officer Brown, and had started  to run.  Deirdre Machado\n\nessentially  corroborated  appellant's  version  of  the  events.\n\nOfficer  Brown,  on   the  other  hand,  testified  that  he  was\n\nacquainted  with Machado and  that she was not  the woman who had\n\nyelled to him that night.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant claims that the government's closing argument\n\ndeprived  him of a fair  trial by disparaging  the credibility of\n\nthe witnesses  for  the defense  and  infringing upon  the  fact-\n\nfinding function reserved to the jury.  As there was no objection\n\nat trial,  we review for plain error, United States v. Grant, 971\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  799,  810  (1st Cir.  1992)  (en  banc);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nNickens, 955  F.2d 112, 120 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 113 S. Ct.\n                                                     \n\n108  (1992),  which  means  we  must  evaluate  the  prosecutor's\n\n                                3\n\nstatements in light of the entire record, Grant, 971 F.2d at 810,\n                                               \n\nand  may  overturn the  jury  verdict  only if  the  government's\n\nclosing  argument \"so poisoned the  well\" that it  is likely that\n\nthe verdict  was affected.   United  States v. Mejia-Lozano,  829\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  268, 274 (1st  Cir. 1987); United  States v. Panet-Collazo,\n                                                                \n\n960  F.2d 256,  260  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 113  S. Ct.  220\n                                               \n\n(1992).  We discern no plain error.\n\n          According to appellant, the prosecutor's  statements in\n\nclosing  argument     that  Sacco did  not  exist, appellant  and\n\nMachado  were  lying,  and  appellant was  guilty      improperly\n\nimplied  that  the  prosecutor  possessed  knowledge  beyond  the\n\npurview  of the evidence and improperly  invoked the authority of\n\nhis  office to bolster his  interpretation of the  evidence.  The\n\ncrux  of appellant's claim  is that  his and  Machado's testimony\n\nconcerning George Sacco's role was uncontradicted and, therefore,\n\nthere  was  no evidence  on which  to predicate  the prosecutor's\n                       \n\ncontention  that he and Machado were lying; accordingly, were the\n\njury to credit their testimony,  there was sufficient evidence to\n\nacquit on the justification defense.\n\n          Although  it is  plainly improper  for a  prosecutor to\n\nimply  reliance on  knowledge  or evidence  not available  to the\n\njury, United States v. Cain, 544 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1976);\n                           \n\nPatriarca  v. United States, 402  F.2d 314, 321  (1st Cir. 1968),\n                           \n\ncert.  denied, 393 U.S. 1022 (1969), there was no such intimation\n             \n\nin this case.  Rather,  considered in the context of the  closing\n\nargument  as a  whole, the  comments cited  by appellant     that\n\n                                4\n\nthere was no Sacco and that Machado belatedly concocted the story\n\nto prevent appellant from being convicted    suggested inferences\n\nthe  jury  might draw  from the  evidence,1  a proper  subject of\n\ncomment  by  the prosecutor.    The  government  may  attempt  to\n\npersuade the jury to draw suggested inferences unfavorable to the\n\ndefense,  as long  as  the prosecutor's  own  opinion as  to  the\n                                                     \n\nwitness' credibility is not urged on the jury.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Mount, 896 F.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir. 1990).\n               \n\n          During  closing argument,  the prosecutor  reminded the\n\njury that  Officer Brown  had testified that     at the  time the\n\nunidentified woman screamed:  \"That man has  a gun!\"    Brown saw\n\nno  one else near the  scene, except appellant  and other persons\n\nrunning from appellant.  The prosecutor further reminded the jury\n                      \n\nthat Officer Brown had testified that the  unidentified woman was\n\nnot Deirdre  Machado.  Finally, the prosecutor noted that Machado\n\nadmitted at trial  that she had never before told  the police, or\n\n                    \n\n     1These comments were as follows:\n\n          This  business about  Sacco  is a  complete fabri-\n     cation.  That's what the evidence shows.\n                                            \n     . . . .\n          Does  that  sound  like  someone who's  worthy  of\n     belief to you?  Of course not.  She [Machado] never did\n     those  things, ladies and gentlemen.  She never filed a\n     complaint against  Sacco because  Sacco never  did any-\n     thing.  There was  no Sacco.  It's a  convenient story.\n     It's a complete fabrication.   She never tried to  help\n     him out  [by filing  a complaint] because  he's guilty.\n     He  didn't do  anything to  disarm Sacco and  save her.\n     That's a lot of nonsense.\n          There was no George Sacco anyplace  because George\n     Sacco wasn't there.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                5\n\nanyone else, about  being restrained at  gunpoint by Sacco,  even\n\nthough  she was  appellant's  friend and  believed  he was  being\n\ncharged  with a crime  that had  been prompted  by his  desire to\n\nprotect her from Sacco.\n\n          Although the phrasing of the prosecutor's argument left\n\nsomething to be desired, it was  not improper to urge the jury to\n\nevaluate the  plausibility of the justification  defense in light\n\nof the  other evidence  (and the  lack thereof),  as well  as the\n\nmotivations  and  biases  of  the  defense  witnesses,  including\n\nappellant.  See United States v.  Savarese, 649 F.2d 83, 87  (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1981) (defendant \"had  no right to expect the  government to\n\nrefrain from commenting on the quality  of his . . . witnesses or\n\nfrom  attacking  the weak  evidentiary  foundation  on which  the\n\n[defense] rested\");  Mount,  896 F.2d  at 626  (not improper  for\n                          \n\ngovernment to argue that  its interpretation of the evidence  was\n\nmore persuasive); United States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 321 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.),  cert. denied, 482 U.S. 929 (1987) (government is entitled\n                    \n\nto comment on plausibility of defense theory).  Nevertheless, the\n\ngovernment's closing unnecessarily risked the impression that the\n\nprosecutor was vouching, either personally  or on the strength of\n\nother extraneous considerations, that George Sacco did not exist,\n\nrather than merely urging the jury to so conclude on the basis of\n                                  \n\nthe evidence.   See, e.g., United States v.  Turner, 892 F.2d 11,\n                                                   \n\n14  (1st Cir.  1989)  (\"[i]t  is  the  jury's  responsibility  to\n\nevaluate the credibility of the evidence presented\").  Similarly,\n\nthe  prosecutor's  repeated  statements  that  the  defendant was\n\n                                6\n\nguilty  verged on the exclusive province of the jury to determine\n\nguilt.   Of  course, any  representation as  to the  prosecutor's\n\npersonal belief in the guilt of an accused is improper.  Nickens,\n                                                                \n\n955 F.2d  at 121; Mejia-Lozano, 829  F.2d at 273.2   The means to\n                              \n\neliminate  even an appearance  of overreaching were  at hand; the\n\nprosecutor   need  simply   have   predicated  these   entreaties\n\nexplicitly and  exclusively on  reasonable inferences yielded  by\n                           \n\nthe  evidence.  See Cain, 544 F.2d at 1116 (prosecutor's argument\n                        \n\nthat accused is guilty is not improper, provided it calls for the\n\njury's assessment of  the evidence  and is not  presented as  the\n\npersonal opinion of the prosecutor).3\n\n                    \n\n     2The government  concedes that  the prosecutor, on  at least\none  other occasion,  implied  a personal  belief in  appellant's\nguilt.  The prosecutor stated:\n\n          I think when you look at the evidence in this case\n                 \n     and use your common  sense, there's only one conclusion\n     you can  reach and that  is that this  defendant Joseph\n     Smith has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   The prosecutor's  statement could  have been\npurged and converted  into permissible argument  by a simple  re-\nphrasing:  \"The government submits . . .\"\n     Another statement by the prosecutor     that even if  appel-\nlant's story were believed  he was \"still guilty\" because  he had\nnot established  a justification  defense    permissibly  urged a\nreasonable  inference  based  directly  and  exclusively  on  the\nevidence.  See infra at pp. 10-12.\n                    \n\n     3Recognizing its  special obligation to see  that justice is\ndone   and  to  refrain  from   improper  methods  in  seeking  a\nconviction, see  United States v. Quesada-Bonilla,  952 F.2d 597,\n                                                 \n602  (1st Cir. 1991);  Berger v. United  States, 295 U.S.  78, 88\n                                               \n(1935),  the  government forthrightly  concedes  improprieties in\ncertain other statements made in its closing argument.\n     It concedes that it  impermissibly used pejorative  language\nin  repeatedly  characterizing  the  testimony  of appellant  and\nMachado as  lies.  See  United States  v. Rodriguez-Estrada,  877\n                                                           \nF.2d 153, 159 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"prosecutor's obligation to desist\nfrom the use  of pejorative language . . . is every bit as solemn\n\n                                7\n\n          A new trial is  unwarranted so long  as we are able  to\n\nconclude  with  a high  degree  of  confidence that  the  alleged\n\nprosecutorial misconduct did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n\nMejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d  at 274; Panet-Collazo,  960 F.2d at  260.\n                                             \n\nThe strength of the case against  the defendant often is the most\n\nsignificant factor  to  be  balanced  against  the  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.   United States v. Boldt,  929 F.2d 35,  41 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991);  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 159.  We therefore examine\n                         \n\nthe evidence,  and other  relevant factors, to  determine whether\n\nthe alleged prosecutorial misconduct warranted a new trial.\n\n          The  prejudice  from  the  errant  statements   in  the\n\nprosecutor's  closing argument  was  mitigated somewhat  by their\n\ncontext  and ambiguity.  See Grant, 971  F.2d at 810.  Cf. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Ingraldi,  793 F.2d  408, 416  (1st Cir.  1986) (among\n                   \n\nfactors for  determining whether new  trial is warranted  is \"the\n\nseverity of the  misconduct\"); United States  v.

Nickens, 955 F.2d at 121 (\"[i]t is . . .  inappropriate for a\n           \nprosecutor to call defendant a liar\").  The prosecutor character-\nized their testimony as \"a lie,\" \"one tall tale,\" and \"a complete\nfabrication.\"    The  government concedes  as  well  that  it was\nimproper  for the  prosecutor  to state  that  he \"welcomed\"  the\nburden of proof in this case.  See United States v.

Farnkoff, 535  F.2d 661,  668\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1976) (the fact that the prosecutor made clear that the\n\njury  should  arrive  at  its  verdict, based  on  the  evidence,\n\nmitigated the  effect of  statement that defendant  was guilty).4\n\nAbsent any  suggestion of superior knowledge  or personal opinion\n\non  the part  of the prosecutor,  similar argumentation  has been\n\nfound not  to be improper.  See United States v. Garcia, 818 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n136,  143-44 (1st  Cir.  1987) (\"Although  we think  a prosecutor\n\nwould be well advised  to avoid directly accusing a  defendant of\n\nlying    since jurors could believe the  government has knowledge\n\noutside  the evidence  about the  defendant's veracity     we are\n\nconfident  that  the  statements in  this  case  would have  been\n\n                    \n\n     4The  court   firmly  advised   the  jury  in   its  opening\ninstructions as follows:\n\n     [Y]ou are the judges of the  facts.  You have to decide\n     what actually happened in this case.  You and you alone\n     make that decision.  No one, simply no one can trespass\n     on   that   very  specialized   unique  area   that  is\n     exclusively yours . . .\n\n     In its final  jury charge, the court reiterated:  \"Remember,\nI told you  that you are the sole judges of the facts.  You alone\ndecide the facts . . . You are the sole judges of the facts.\"\n     Contemporaneous  curative  instructions were  not  given, as\nnone were  requested.  In its opening jury instructions, however,\nthe  district court  informed  the jury  that  the statements  of\ncounsel  are not evidence.   In its final  charge, given the same\nday as its opening instructions, the court reminded the jury that\nthe  evidence was limited to  the testimony of  the witnesses and\nthe exhibits admitted by the court.\n\n                                9\n\nperceived only as commentary on the implausibility of the  defen-\n\ndant's  story.\").   Nor did  the overzealous  statement that  the\n\nprosecutor \"welcome[d]\" the burden of proof constitute reversible\n\nerror,  as  its context  did  not suggest  that  the prosecutor's\n\nconfidence was  founded on  knowledge or evidence  unavailable to\n\nthe jury.5   See Flaherty, 668  F.2d at 597.   Viewed in context,\n                         \n\nthese  ambiguous statements  were not  \"so egregious  that [they]\n\n'seriously  affect[ed]   the   fairness,  integrity   or   public\n\nreputation of judicial  proceedings.'\"  Nickens, 955  F.2d at 121\n                                               \n\n(quoting United States v.

The  entire defense was\n                                                     \n\nthat appellant's possession of the firearm was  justified.  Among\n\nthe  essential elements  of a  justification defense,  see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States  v.

There was no contention that appellant\n\nbelieved  he was in any  physical danger from  Officer Brown, but\n                                                            \n\nonly from Sacco.   Thus, even assuming appellant's  possession of\n\nthe firearm was justified at the outset, his refusal to surrender\n\nit at the request of a  police officer from whom he did not  fear\n\nbodily  harm   (as   distinguished  from   arrest   for   illegal\n\npossession),  rendered  the  justification defense  unsupportable\n\nunder any view of the evidence.  See United States v. Stover, 822\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 48, 50 (8th Cir. 1987) (justification defense does not apply\n\nwhen possession continues after  the imminent danger of death  or\n\nserious bodily harm has passed).\n\n          Given  that  appellant's   justification  defense   was\n\nfatally  deficient, as a matter of law, without regard to whether\n\nthe  roles of  George  Sacco and  Deirdre  Machado were  real  or\n\nconcocted,   the  government's   closing  argument   affected  no\n\nsubstantial right.7   See,  e.g., Rodriguez-Estrada, 877  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n159 (although prosecutor called defendant a liar and crook, error\n\nheld  \"harmless\" in  light  of overwhelming  evidence of  guilt);\n\nUnited States v.

Hodge-\n                                                                 \n\nBalwing, 952 F.2d 607, 611  (1st Cir. 1991), and is  not entitled\n       \n\nto  a new one.   See  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  52(b) (no  \"plain error\"\n                    \n\nunless it \"affect[s] substantial rights\").\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     8Finally,  the prosecutor's statements were not so egregious\nas to warrant ordering a new trial as a deterrent  to future mis-\nconduct.   See, e.g., Quesada-Bonilla, 952 F.2d at 602 (court may\n                                     \ngrant new trial  to deter future prosecutorial misconduct).   The\nSupreme Court has cautioned against reversals for harmless error.\nUnited States v.

Moreover, we are aware of\nnothing  which  would  indicate  that  these  improprieties  were\nanything  other  than an  isolated  instance  which will  not  be\nrepeated.   See United  States v. Dworken,  855 F.2d  12, 32 (1st\n                                         \nCir.  1988)  (we will  not  order a  new  trial  simply to  deter\nmisconduct in circumstances where we are confident the misconduct\nwill not be repeated).\n\n                                12\n",

On August 4, 1991,\n\nPatrolman Robert Brown, Jr.,  responded to a reported disturbance\n\nat the  Hot Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  After assisting in\n\nresolving  the dispute, Officer Brown  was told by  a patron that\n\nanother  disturbance had broken out  between two men  in a nearby\n\nparking  lot.   As  Brown approached  the  parking lot,  a  woman\n\nstanding  near him  screamed:   \"That  man has  a gun!\"   In  the\n\ndirection indicated by the woman, the officer saw appellant Smith\n\nstanding alone, and other people running away from Smith.\n\n          The officer  approached appellant and told  him to drop\n\nthe  gun.  Smith held out his  palms, which were empty, and said,\n\n\"I ain't  got no gun,\" then  turned and ran.   Officer Brown gave\n\nchase  and  radioed for  assistance.    Following a  two-to-three\n\nminute chase,  covering one-quarter  to one-half mile,  Smith was\n\napprehended;  an  unloaded  .25  caliber  automatic  handgun  was\n\nremoved from  his waistband.   Appellant's sole defense  at trial\n\nwasthathispossessionofthe firearmwasjustifiedinthe circumstances.\n\n          According  to his  own  testimony,  appellant had  been\n\nstanding outside the  club when  another man said  to him:   \"Hey\n\nJoe, I've got your f'ing girlfriend.\"  Turning  around, appellant\n\nsaw a  man,  whom  he identified  as  George  Sacco,  restraining\n\nappellant's girlfriend, Deirdre Machado, and holding a gun to her\n\nside.  Appellant testified that he approached Sacco, who tripped,\n\nand, after they scuffled,  appellant grabbed the gun  from Sacco.\n\nAppellant  testified that it was  Machado who yelled:   \"That man\n\nhas a  gun,\" and  that Machado  had meant that  Sacco had  a gun.\n\nAppellant admitted at  trial that he had denied having a gun when\n\nasked by Officer Brown, and had started  to run.  Deirdre Machado\n\nessentially  corroborated  appellant's  version  of  the  events.\n\nOfficer  Brown,  on   the  other  hand,  testified  that  he  was\n\nacquainted  with Machado and  that she was not  the woman who had\n\nyelled to him that night.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant claims that the government's closing argument\n\ndeprived  him of a fair  trial by disparaging  the credibility of\n\nthe witnesses  for  the defense  and  infringing upon  the  fact-\n\nfinding function reserved to the jury.

The\n\ncrux  of appellant's claim  is that  his and  Machado's testimony\n\nconcerning George Sacco's role was uncontradicted and, therefore,\n\nthere  was  no evidence  on which  to predicate  the prosecutor's\n                       \n\ncontention  that he and Machado were lying; accordingly, were the\n\njury to credit their testimony,  there was sufficient evidence to\n\nacquit on the justification defense.\n\n          Although  it is  plainly improper  for a  prosecutor to\n\nimply  reliance on  knowledge  or evidence  not available  to the\n\njury, United States v.

The prosecutor further reminded the jury\n                      \n\nthat Officer Brown had testified that the  unidentified woman was\n\nnot Deirdre  Machado.  Finally, the prosecutor noted that Machado\n\nadmitted at trial  that she had never before told  the police, or\n\n                    \n\n     1These comments were as follows:\n\n          This  business about  Sacco  is a  complete fabri-\n     cation.

She [Machado] never did\n     those  things, ladies and gentlemen.  She never filed a\n     complaint against  Sacco because  Sacco never  did any-\n     thing.  There was  no Sacco.  It's a  convenient story.\n     It's a complete fabrication.   She never tried to  help\n     him out  [by filing  a complaint] because  he's guilty.\n     He  didn't do  anything to  disarm Sacco and  save her.\n     That's a lot of nonsense.\n          There was no George Sacco anyplace  because George\n     Sacco wasn't there.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                5\n\nanyone else, about  being restrained at  gunpoint by Sacco,  even\n\nthough  she was  appellant's  friend and  believed  he was  being\n\ncharged  with a crime  that had  been prompted  by his  desire to\n\nprotect her from Sacco.\n\n          Although the phrasing of the prosecutor's argument left\n\nsomething to be desired, it was  not improper to urge the jury to\n\nevaluate the  plausibility of the justification  defense in light\n\nof the  other evidence  (and the  lack thereof),  as well  as the\n\nmotivations  and  biases  of  the  defense  witnesses,  including\n\nappellant.

There was no contention that appellant\n\nbelieved  he was in any  physical danger from  Officer Brown, but\n                                                            \n\nonly from Sacco.   Thus, even assuming appellant's  possession of\n\nthe firearm was justified at the outset, his refusal to surrender\n\nit at the request of a  police officer from whom he did not  fear\n\nbodily  harm   (as   distinguished  from   arrest   for   illegal\n\npossession),  rendered  the  justification defense  unsupportable\n\nunder any view of the evidence.
