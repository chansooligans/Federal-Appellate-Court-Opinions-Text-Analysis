This case began  in March 1981  with\n                    \n\nthe    filing    of    plaintiff-appellant   Morgan    James'\n\ndiscrimination  complaint against  the New  England Telephone\n\nCompany  (\"NET\"),  his  employer  from  1974  to  1983.    It\n\nconcluded in January  1991 when summary  judgment entered  in\n\nfavor  of NET.1   Before  us are  two companion  appeals: the\n\nfirst purports  to appeal from the  adverse summary judgment;\n\nthe second is from the denial of plaintiff's motion, pursuant\n\nto Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b),  to reconsider.   We conclude that\n\nthe plaintiff has effectively waived all appellate claims  in\n\nthe first appeal, find  no abuse of discretion in  the denial\n\nof the Rule 60(b) motion, and affirm both judgments.\n\n                 THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT APPEAL\n                                            \n\n          Appellant's  brief2 in  this  appeal argues  solely\n\nthat later  discovered  evidence  would  have  shown  that  a\n\ngenuine and  material factual dispute existed  as to pretext,\n\nMcDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411  U.S. 792, 804 (1973),\n                                 \n\n                    \n\n1.   A magistrate-judge decided the  case by agreement of the\nparties under 28 U.S.C.   636(c).\n\n2.   Only two issues are raised:\n          (1).  Whether  the  Court  below   is  required  to\nconsider newly discovered evidence  pursuant to Rule 60(b) of\nthe  Federal  Rules  of   Civil  Procedure,  when,  with  due\ndiligence, the movant could  not have discovered the evidence\nat [the] time of the original proceeding.\n          (2). Whether  the newly discovered evidence  was of\nsuch a  material and controlling  nature as to  have affected\nthe outcome of the original proceeding.\n\nprecluding summary judgment against him.  The brief, filed by\n\nplaintiff's counsel, concedes that:\n\n     Appellant   did   not   successfully   oppose   the\n     Appellee's Motion  for  Summary Judgment  at  court\n     below because  there was  evidence  that tended  to\n     refute   and    otherwise   contradict   Appellee's\n     witnesses   that  was  not,   with  due  diligence,\n     available  to Appellant when Appellant as Plaintiff\n     below  filed its  Motion in  Opposition to  Summary\n     Judgment.\n\n     Plaintiff-Appellant's  failure  to supply  specific\n     facts of a genuine and material issue in dispute in\n     court   below  was  due  entirely  [to]  Plaintiff-\n     Appellant's  inability to obtain  all of the needed\n     affidavits timely, even with diligence; and because\n     many of the affidavits were not yet discovered.\n\nThe  brief does not address how the district court's judgment\n\nwas in error, or otherwise contend that the plaintiff had, at\n\nthe summary  judgment stage,  established the existence  of a\n\ngenuine and material issue  sufficient to rebut NET's motion.\n\nSee Mesnick v. General  Electric Co., 950 F.2d 816,  822 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2965 (1992).  These, and\n                        \n\nother  statements  filed in  this  court,  indicate that  the\n\nappellant  has unambiguously  waived  the right  to have  the\n\ncorrectness of the grant  of summary judgment in  NET's favor\n\nreviewed by this court.   Jusino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986,  993\n                                         \n\nn.9 (1st Cir. 1989) (challenges to the lower court's judgment\n\nthat are neither briefed or argued are waived); Pignons  S.A.\n                                                             \n\nde  Mecanique  v. Polaroid,  701 F.2d  1,  3 (1st  Cir. 1983)\n                          \n\n(\"[A]n appellee is  entitled to  rely on the  contents of  an\n\nappellant's brief for the scope of  the issues appealed . . .\n\n                             -3-\n\n.\").   Nor  can plaintiff's  pro se  attacks3 on  the summary\n                                   \n\njudgment decision, made after the appellee's brief was filed,\n\nextinguish that waiver.  See United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n880, 885 n.8 (1st  Cir. 1992) (appellant may not  enlarge the\n\nscope of the issues appealed  after initial briefing).  Thus,\n\nany  challenge to the propriety of  summary judgment in favor\n\nof the defendant has been waived.\n\n                    THE RULE 60(B) APPEAL\n                                         \n\n          The  only  question  presented  by  this  appeal is\n\nwhether the district court  abused its discretion in deciding\n\nthat  plaintiff's motion  under  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 60(b)  for\n\nrelief from summary judgment did not present newly discovered\n\n                    \n\n3.   In  particular, claims  of  judicial bias  or partiality\nmust first  be addressed to  the trial  judge.  In  re Abijoe\n                                                             \nRealty Corp., 943  F.2d 121,  126 (1st Cir.  1991); see  also\n                                                             \nUnited States  v.  Chantal, 902  F.2d  1018, 1024  (1st  Cir.\n                          \n1990).   At  no time  during the  lengthy  proceedings below,\nincluding the  request  for 60(b)  reconsideration,  did  the\nplaintiff suggest partiality, thus effectively  immunizing it\nfrom judicial scrutiny.  Abijoe Realty, 943 F.2d at 127.  The\n                                      \nplaintiff  offers no reason why the issue could not have been\nput  before the  trial  court.   See  Playboy Enterprises  v.\n                                                         \nPublic  Service  Comm., 906  F.2d  25, 40  (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \ndenied, 111 S. Ct. 388 (1990).  No facts or circumstances are\n      \npresented  that  would  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  even\nremotely doubt the magistrate's impartiality.  Merely issuing\nunfavorable rulings, Lisa v.

Because of the  clear and thorough disposition  by the\n\nmagistrate  on summary judgment, we do not relate the details\n\nof every claim  presented and decided below,  and repeat only\n\nthose facts and conclusions necessary to decide this appeal.\n\n          Plaintiff's  employment  discrimination  complaints\n\nrevolve  around his demotion due to  a speech \"problem\" which\n\nNET  claimed   seriously  interfered  with  his   ability  to\n\ncommunicate  and perform.  The plaintiff is a black male who,\n\nadmittedly, speaks with a slight Jamacian/West  Indian accent\n\nand speech pattern.   In  support of its  motion for  summary\n\njudgment  NET offered  evidence that  plaintiff had  a speech\n\ndefect which  caused him,  despite speech therapy  during the\n\ncourse of employment, to perform in an unsatisfactory manner.\n\nOn  motion for  reconsideration, filed  six months  after the\n\nentry of summary judgment against him, plaintiff attempted to\n\nshow  that  newly  discovered  evidence  revealed   that  the\n\nplaintiff had, in fact, no diagnosed speech  defect and that,\n\nconsequently,   NET's  rationale  for  its  decision  not  to\n\npromote,   and  to   demote,   was  a   pretext  for   racial\n\ndiscrimination.4  \n\n                    \n\n4.   Much of  the  motion  to  reconsider,  like  appellant's\nbrief,  is devoted  to arguing the merits of his case against\nNET.  As  this appeal  addresses only the  order denying  the\n60(b)  motion, and  for  the reasons  discussed earlier,  the\nmerits of  the underlying grant  of summary judgment  are not\nbefore us.   See, e.g., Parrilla-Lopez v. United  States, 841\n                                                        \nF.2d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1988).    \n\n                             -5-\n\n          The  \"new\"  evidence  supporting  plaintiff's  Rule\n\n60(b)(2)  motion took the form of medical reports which post-\n\ndated the entry of summary judgment in NET's favor and stated\n\nthat the plaintiff did not have the particular speech  defect\n\nclaimed  by NET as the reason for its employment decision not\n\nto promote the plaintiff.   The reports presented evaluations\n\nbased  on  a  series  of assessments  of  plaintiff's  speech\n\npatterns that were originally performed in 1978 and 1979, but\n\nwhich, the plaintiff asserted, were heretofore available only\n\nin  illegible  handwritten  form.    The  plaintiff professed\n\nknowledge  of the reports at  the time his  opposition to the\n\nmotion for  summary judgment was  filed, but stated  that the\n\nrecords  were  not,  despite  diligent efforts  to  obtain  a\n\n\"translation\", available in legible form  at that time due to\n\ndifficulty in retrieving  the information from the  reporting\n\nsource.   The motion also stated that counsel's illness was a\n\ncontributing factor  in the inability to  properly respond at\n\nthe time the summary judgment opposition was filed.5\n\n                    \n\n5.   Plaintiff's counsel at the  Rule 60(b) stage had entered\nthe case  shortly before  NET's motion for  summary judgement\nwas  filed.  During the  prior ten-year history  of the case,\nplaintiff  was represented,  at various  times, by  two other\nattorneys, or had appeared pro se.  \n                                  \n     After NET  moved for  summary judgment,  plaintiff filed\ntwo motions for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing\n(each occasioned by the rescheduling of counsel's bone marrow\nimplant  operation);  both were  granted.    In allowing  the\nsecond  continuance,  the  magistrate  indicated,  apparently\ntaking into account counsel's ill health, that the motion for\nsummary judgment would be decided on the parties' submissions\nsome six weeks  later.   At no time  did plaintiff's  counsel\n\n                             -6-\n\n          The magistrate refused to grant the motion because,\n\ndespite professing  earlier  knowledge of  the evidence,  the\n\nplaintiff  did not request an extension of time to respond to\n\nthe summary  judgment motion,  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(f)6,  and\n\ncould  not, given  the  lengthy  history  of  the  case  -  -\n\nincluding the  allowance of  an extremely late  opposition to\n\nthe motion  for  summary  judgment, make  a  claim  that  the\n\ndocuments  now  offered  were   difficult  to  obtain.    The\n\nmagistrate  concluded  that  the  plaintiff  had   failed  to\n\ndemonstrate either that the  evidence was newly discovered or\n\nthat  due  diligence could  not  have  uncovered it  earlier,\n\nNickerson  v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.,  900 F.2d 412, 417 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1990), and deemed the motion frivolous.  We review the denial\n\nof  a Rule  60(b) motion  for abuse  of discretion,  Duffy v.\n                                                          \n\nClippinger, 857  F.2d 877, 879  (1st Cir.  1988), and  cannot\n          \n\n                    \n\nseek an  extension of time to file an opposition.  Almost two\nmonths after the grant of  the second continuance, and  three\nmonths  after   the  summary  judgment   motion  was   filed,\nplaintiff's  counsel  filed  a  request  for  leave  to  file\nplaintiff's  opposition,  offering ill  health  and the  bone\nmarrow  operation as reason for the delay.  The only opposing\naffidavit offered was that of the plaintiff.   The magistrate\nallowed the request and considered the plaintiff's opposition\nin  the ruling  on the  summary judgment  motion  three weeks\nlater.\n\n6.   Rule 56(f) states, in relevant part:\n     Should  it appear.  . .  that the  [opposing] party\n     cannot  .  . .  present facts  .  . .  essential to\n     justify the party's opposition, the court may . . .\n     order  a continuance  to  permit  affidavits to  be\n     obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to\n     be had or may make such other order as is just.\n\n                             -7-\n\nfind that  an error of  judgment was committed  here.   It is\n\nclear that the proffered  documents were not newly discovered\n\nsince the plaintiff  was aware of their  existence when NET's\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment was  filed.   Parrilla-Lopez v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 841 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988).  Nor does the\n             \n\nplaintiff  assert  that  further  facts  became  known  after\n\nsummary  judgment  entered.    See  Mas  Marques  v.  Digital\n                                                             \n\nEquipment Corp., 637 F.2d  24, 29 (1st Cir.  1980).  Even  if\n               \n\nthe documents  remained illegible at the  time the opposition\n\nwas due, Rule 56(c),  it was incumbent upon the  plaintiff to\n\nmake known to  the magistrate  the existence of  any and  all\n\nmaterial  facts  bearing  on   summary  judgment  either   by\n\nintroducing affidavits from the treating sources or otherwise\n\nutilizing the mechanisms of Rule 56(f).\n\n          Rule  60(b)(2)  also requires  the moving  party to\n\nshow  due diligence in order  to secure relief from judgment.\n\nThe  plaintiff's  brief  argues  that  the  medical   records\n\npurporting to show that  the plaintiff had no speech  or oral\n\ncommunication  problem were  unavailable  because  they  were\n\nunreadable and their conclusions had to be reconstructed from\n\nthe original speech and language  tests performed in 1978 and\n\n1979.   However,  this  falls  short  of explaining  why  the\n\nplaintiff  did not  at least  verify the  existence of  these\n                                                   \n\nrecords  at the time the summary judgment was filed, or apply\n\nfor a continuance  as provided for in Rule 56(f).   Lepore v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -8-\n\nVidockler,  792 F.2d  272, 274  (1st Cir.  1986).   Given the\n         \n\nlengthy history  of the  case, including that  the magistrate\n\nwas clearly indulgent of counsel's difficulties, and  mindful\n\nthat  Rule 60(b)  affords  \"extraordinary  relief\"  available\n\n\"only under  exceptional circumstances,\" United States v. One\n                                                             \n\nUrban Lot,  882 F.2d 582-83,  585 (1st Cir.  1989) (citations\n         \n\nomitted),  we cannot find an  abuse of discretion in refusing\n\nto reconsider summary judgment.7\n\n          Accordingly,  the judgments  of the  district court\n\nare  affirmed.

Because of the  clear and thorough disposition  by the\n\nmagistrate  on summary judgment, we do not relate the details\n\nof every claim  presented and decided below,  and repeat only\n\nthose facts and conclusions necessary to decide this appeal.\n\n          Plaintiff's  employment  discrimination  complaints\n\nrevolve  around his demotion due to  a speech \"problem\" which\n\nNET  claimed   seriously  interfered  with  his   ability  to\n\ncommunicate  and perform.  The plaintiff is a black male who,\n\nadmittedly, speaks with a slight Jamacian/West  Indian accent\n\nand speech pattern.   In  support of its  motion for  summary\n\njudgment  NET offered  evidence that  plaintiff had  a speech\n\ndefect which  caused him,  despite speech therapy  during the\n\ncourse of employment, to perform in an unsatisfactory manner.\n\nOn  motion for  reconsideration, filed  six months  after the\n\nentry of summary judgment against him, plaintiff attempted to\n\nshow  that  newly  discovered  evidence  revealed   that  the\n\nplaintiff had, in fact, no diagnosed speech  defect and that,\n\nconsequently,   NET's  rationale  for  its  decision  not  to\n\npromote,   and  to   demote,   was  a   pretext  for   racial\n\ndiscrimination.4  \n\n                    \n\n4.   Much of  the  motion  to  reconsider,  like  appellant's\nbrief,  is devoted  to arguing the merits of his case against\nNET.

The reports presented evaluations\n\nbased  on  a  series  of assessments  of  plaintiff's  speech\n\npatterns that were originally performed in 1978 and 1979, but\n\nwhich, the plaintiff asserted, were heretofore available only\n\nin  illegible  handwritten  form.    The  plaintiff professed\n\nknowledge  of the reports at  the time his  opposition to the\n\nmotion for  summary judgment was  filed, but stated  that the\n\nrecords  were  not,  despite  diligent efforts  to  obtain  a\n\n\"translation\", available in legible form  at that time due to\n\ndifficulty in retrieving  the information from the  reporting\n\nsource.   The motion also stated that counsel's illness was a\n\ncontributing factor  in the inability to  properly respond at\n\nthe time the summary judgment opposition was filed.5\n\n                    \n\n5.   Plaintiff's counsel at the  Rule 60(b) stage had entered\nthe case  shortly before  NET's motion for  summary judgement\nwas  filed.  During the  prior ten-year history  of the case,\nplaintiff  was represented,  at various  times, by  two other\nattorneys, or had appeared pro se.  \n                                  \n     After NET  moved for  summary judgment,  plaintiff filed\ntwo motions for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing\n(each occasioned by the rescheduling of counsel's bone marrow\nimplant  operation);  both were  granted.    In allowing  the\nsecond  continuance,  the  magistrate  indicated,  apparently\ntaking into account counsel's ill health, that the motion for\nsummary judgment would be decided on the parties' submissions\nsome six weeks  later.

The\n\nmagistrate  concluded  that  the  plaintiff  had   failed  to\n\ndemonstrate either that the  evidence was newly discovered or\n\nthat  due  diligence could  not  have  uncovered it  earlier,\n\nNickerson  v.

Parrilla-Lopez v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502480\"><a href=\"/opinion/502480/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1988).  Nor does the\n             \n\nplaintiff  assert  that  further  facts  became  known  after\n\nsummary  judgment  entered.    See  Mas  Marques  v.  Digital\n                                                             \n\nEquipment Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385711\"><a href=\"/opinion/385711/24-fair-emplpraccas-1286-24-empl-prac-dec-p-31415-diego-mas-marques/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (1st Cir.  1980).  Even  if\n               \n\nthe documents  remained illegible at the  time the opposition\n\nwas due, Rule 56(c),  it was incumbent upon the  plaintiff to\n\nmake known to  the magistrate  the existence of  any and  all\n\nmaterial  facts  bearing  on   summary  judgment  either   by\n\nintroducing affidavits from the treating sources or otherwise\n\nutilizing the mechanisms of Rule 56(f).\n\n          Rule  60(b)(2)  also requires  the moving  party to\n\nshow  due diligence in order  to secure relief from judgment.\n\nThe  plaintiff's  brief  argues  that  the  medical   records\n\npurporting to show that  the plaintiff had no speech  or oral\n\ncommunication  problem were  unavailable  because  they  were\n\nunreadable and their conclusions had to be reconstructed from\n\nthe original speech and language  tests performed in 1978 and\n\n1979.   However,  this  falls  short  of explaining  why  the\n\nplaintiff  did not  at least  verify the  existence of  these\n                                                   \n\nrecords  at the time the summary judgment was filed, or apply\n\nfor a continuance  as provided for in Rule 56(f).

Given the\n         \n\nlengthy history  of the  case, including that  the magistrate\n\nwas clearly indulgent of counsel's difficulties, and  mindful\n\nthat  Rule 60(b)  affords  \"extraordinary  relief\"  available\n\n\"only under  exceptional circumstances,\" United States v. One\n                                                             \n\nUrban Lot,  882 F.2d 582-83,  585 (1st Cir.  1989) (citations\n         \n\nomitted),  we cannot find an  abuse of discretion in refusing\n\nto reconsider summary judgment.7\n\n          Accordingly,  the judgments  of the  district court\n\nare  affirmed.   Appellees'  request for  an award  of double\n             \n\ncosts and attorney's fees in the Rule 60(b) appeal is denied.\n\n                    \n\n7.   Since relief from judgment under Rule  60(b)(2) requires\nthat each of  four elements  be present, Duffy,  857 F.2d  at\n                                              \n879, we  need  not reach  appellant's  claim that  the  \"new\"\nevidence would likely change the summary judgment outcome.  \n\n                             -9-\n</pre>",
