Petitioner-appellant  Wilfred Hart,\n                     \n\nJr.,  has filed three appeals arising out of a district court\n\ninjunction  barring  Hart  from  further  repetitive  filings\n\nwithout  leave  of court.   With  the  exception of  a single\n\nmatter,  we affirm the rulings  of the district  court in all\n\nthree appeals.\n\n                  Appeal no. 92-1801\n                                    \n\n          In  conjunction  with the  dismissal  of  a    2255\n\npetition  filed by  Hart, the  district court,  noting Hart's\n\n\"frivolous motions and  duplicative pleadings which  encroach\n\non the  Court's limited time and  resources, . . .  which can\n\nonly be  calculated to  disrupt the orderly  consideration of\n\ncases,  .  . .  and which  merely  restate claims  which have\n\nalready made [sic] and which have been denied\", entered a sua\n                                                             \n\nsponte  order  on  February  12, 1992,  enjoining  Hart  from\n      \n\nfurther filings  in connection with his  1988 drug conviction\n\nwithout prior leave of  court.  After Hart filed a  motion on\n\nMarch 10, 1992, objecting  that he had not been  given notice\n\nand an opportunity to be heard  before the injunction issued,\n\nthe district court  on that same date vacated  its injunction\n\n\"in  order to permit [Hart] to make whatever showing he can.\"\n\nHart was  directed to file a  memorandum of law on  the issue\n\nwithin thirty days.  \n\n          Over three months later, on June 23, 1992  -- after\n\nHart had filed nothing further pertaining to the injunction -\n\n                             -2-\n\n-  the  district  court   issued  an  order  reinstating  the\n\ninjunction, \"with slight modifications.\"    The court's order\n\nconcluded as follows:\n\n               It   is  hereby   ORDERED  that\n                                        \n               Wilfred  Hart is  enjoined from\n               filing  any motions,  pleadings\n               or papers of  whatever type  or\n               description in  the District of\n               Maine,  in connection  with his\n               1988 conviction for  controlled\n               substance   violations  without\n               prior leave of Court.  Hart may\n               seek leave of Court by filing a\n               summary of the claims  he seeks\n               to  raise  (not  to exceed  one\n               page  per claim)  together with\n               an  affidavit  certifying  that\n               the claims are  novel and  have\n               not   previously   been  raised\n               before this Court or  any other\n               federal court.  Upon failure to\n               so  certify  or  failure to  so\n               certify truthfully, Hart may be\n               found in contempt of  court and\n               punished accordingly.\n\nHart filed  a timely  notice of appeal  from this  injunction\n\n(appeal no. 92-1801).\n\n          We  have  stated  that  \"[f]ederal  courts  plainly\n\npossess  discretionary  powers  to  regulate the  conduct  of\n\nabusive litigants.\"  Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 32,  34  (1st  Cir. 1993).    Accordingly,  \"in  extreme\n\ncircumstances  involving  groundless  encroachment  upon  the\n\nlimited time and resources of the court and other parties, an\n\ninjunction  barring  a  party   from  filing  and  processing\n\nfrivolous and vexatious lawsuits may be appropriate.\"  Castro\n                                                             \n\nv.  United States, 775  F.2d 399,  408 (1st  Cir. 1985).   We\n                 \n\n                             -3-\n\nreview  the  issuance  of such  an  injunction  for abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  Id.\n               \n\n          In its February 12,  1992 order, the district court\n\nset  out  a history  of  abusive,  vexatious, and  repetitive\n\nlitigation which  clearly established  a need for  injunctive\n\nmeasures.   Hart  has filed  petitions for  collateral relief\n\nfrom  his criminal  conviction  in at  least three  different\n\ndistrict courts.  \"In  this collateral proceeding alone,\" the\n\ndistrict court pointed out, \"Hart has filed some twenty-seven\n\nseparately   docketed   documents,   most   of   which   defy\n\ncategorization.\"  In our opinion affirming Hart's conviction,\n\nthis court also noted that before conviction, Hart at various\n\ndifferent  times had \"filed a flood of motions, many pro se,\"\n\n\"filed fifteen pro se petitions for writs of habeas corpus or\n\nrelated civil  causes of action,  all of which  were denied,\"\n\nfiled \"a torrent  of new  pro se motions,\"  and \"deluged  the\n\ncourt with at least sixty-six different motions, most of them\n\npro se.\"  United States v. Hart, 933 F.2d 80, 81-82 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1991).\n\n          Restrictions  on filing  \"must be  tailored to  the\n\nspecific circumstances  presented.\"  Cok, supra,  985 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n34.  Thus, we  have found too sweeping an  injunction against\n\ncommencing any  actions in  the district court  without prior\n              \n\napproval,  where the  record  did not  show \"such  widespread\n\nabuse of the judicial system as to warrant such a broad . . .\n\n                             -4-\n\nprohibition.\"   Id. at 36.   In this case,  the injunction is\n                  \n\nlimited to  filings  relating to  Hart's  oft-litigated  1988\n\nfederal  narcotics  conviction.    The  injunction  places no\n\nlimits  on  any other  sorts of  filings.   The  record amply\n\njustifies this relatively narrow proscription.\n\n          Hart alleges a violation  of his due process rights\n\nby virtue of the  fact that the injunction was  not requested\n\nby the government, but  was entered by the court sua sponte. \n                                                           \n\nSua sponte  entry of such an injunction, however, is improper\n          \n\nonly where the  plaintiff is \"not  warned or otherwise  given\n\nnotice that  filing restrictions were contemplated.\"   Id. at\n                                                         \n\n35.   Here, by contrast,  Hart was given ample  notice of the\n\nissue  and  ample opportunity  to  respond  before the  court\n\nfinalized the injunction on June 23, 1992.\n\n          Hart  contends that  the district  court improperly\n\nfailed   to  consider  his   objections  to  the  injunction,\n\ncontained in a motion  and accompanying memorandum Hart filed\n\non March 10, 1992,  and wrongly stated  in its June 23,  1992\n\norder  that  he  not filed  any  objections.    All that  the\n\ndistrict  court stated in  its June 23,  1992 order, however,\n\nwas that Hart had failed to file the additional memorandum of\n\nlaw the district  court had invited him to file  in its March\n\n10,  1992 order.  In that  March 10, 1992 order, the district\n\ncourt expressly referred to Hart's motion of that  same date,\n\nand  to Hart's argument in that motion and memorandum that he\n\n                             -5-\n\nhad  not been given notice  and an opportunity  to respond to\n\nthe  district court's February  12, 1992 order.   Clearly the\n\ndistrict  court in  fact did  not ignore  or overlook  Hart's\n\nmotion and memorandum.   We  can presume that  the court  did\n\nconsider the arguments Hart advanced therein.  \n\n          Hart also  claims that the terms  of the injunction\n\nare  impermissibly vague.  For  example, he sees ambiguity in\n\nthe  requirement  that  he   raise  challenges  to  his  1988\n\nconviction that \"have not  previously been raised before this\n\nCourt or any other  federal court.\"  According to  Hart, this\n\nformulation leaves it unclear  whether claims he raised which\n\nin  fact were  never  adjudicated by  the  federal court  are\n\ncovered   by  the   injunction.     Although  we   leave  the\n\nconstruction of the  injunction to the district  court in the\n\nfirst  instance,  we note  that a  dismissal  of a  motion or\n\npetition that does not expressly discuss issues raised in the\n\nmotion or petition ordinarily would be assumed to dismiss all\n                                                             \n\nissues that had been raised.  We see no vagueness problem  in\n\nthe  district   court's  injunction.     Hart's  many   other\n\nsuggestions of vagueness are all without merit.\n\n          Hart further claims that the injunction is based on\n\nthe  district  court's  erroneous  statement in  its  initial\n\nFebruary  12, 1992 order that the court by separate order had\n\n\"dealt with  all  pending  motions  in this  matter.\"    Hart\n\nobjects that  some motions  in his  original   2255  petition\n\n                             -6-\n\nremain undecided.   Even  assuming, arguendo, that  Hart were\n                                            \n\ncorrect --  an issue we need not decide here -- such an error\n\nwould  not detract  from the  validity of  the injunction  at\n\nissue.  \n\n                     Appeal no. 92-2292\n                                       \n\n          After   the  issuance   of  the   injunction,  Hart\n\nsubmitted papers for filing in the district court on July 20,\n\nJuly 24, and September  8, 1992.  All three  submissions were\n\nsummarily rejected for filing on the ground that Hart did not\n\ncomply  with  the injunction.    Hart filed  a  timely second\n\nnotice of appeal from the third of these rejections.  \n\n          Hart challenges  the district court's  rejection of\n\nhis  proffered  filings.     Since  Hart's  submissions  were\n\nreturned to him without filing, they are not in the record on\n\nappeal.   The  government,  however, states  in its  brief on\n\nappeal that  with  each  submission Hart  did  not  file  the\n\nrequired  accompanying affidavit  certifying that  the claims\n\nwere novel, or the required one-page summary of each claim he\n\nsought to raise.   In  his filings on  appeal, Hart does  not\n\nappear  to  contest  this.   Consequently,  we  affirm  these\n\ndistrict court orders.\n\n                      Appeal no. 92-2449\n                                        \n\n          On  October 13,  1992,  Hart filed  another    2255\n\npetition raising  ten claims.   The petition gave  a one-page\n\nsummary of each  claim, and was  accompanied by an  affidavit\n\n                             -7-\n\ncertifying  that the claims were  novel.  On  October 20, the\n\ndistrict  court clerk  sent Hart  a  letter stating  that the\n\ndistrict judge had summarily rejected the petition for filing\n\non the ground that it violated the injunction.\n\n          On October 22, Hart filed an eleventh   2255 claim,\n\nalleging that Hart had  not been competent to stand  trial in\n\n1988, when  he was  convicted.  In  a November  2 order,  the\n\ndistrict  court  stated  that  Hart  had  complied  with  the\n\ninjunction's requirements  of  an affidavit  and  a  one-page\n\nstatement regarding this claim,  but that the court  was \"not\n\nsatisfied\" that the  claim was  novel.  \"In  any event,\"  the\n\ncourt  concluded, \"if  [Hart]  failed to  properly raise  the\n\nissue of competence at an earlier proceeding, the issue  must\n\nnow be deemed waived and incapable of review by this Court.\"\n\n          On November  16, Hart filed  a motion for  leave to\n\nfile a motion  requesting that the  court explain why  Hart's\n\nOctober  13  filing  of  ten  claims  had been  rejected  for\n\nviolation  of the  injunction.   In a  December 3  order, the\n\ncourt denied leave  to file, stating  that Hart's October  13\n\nfiling  of ten  claims had  been  rejected because  of Hart's\n\n\"failure to state  claims that were novel  and not previously\n\nraised  in  federal court.\"    Hart followed  with  his third\n\nnotice of appeal.   \n\n          We affirm the district court's refusal to allow the\n\nfiling of Hart's  claim that  he was not  competent to  stand\n\n                             -8-\n\ntrial.   Hart  had  raised this  same  issue  at trial.    In\n\nresponse,  the   trial   court  had   ordered   psychological\n\nevaluations  to  look  into  Hart's  competence,  but   these\n\nevaluations   \"could  not  be  completed  because  of  Hart's\n\nintransigence,\" so \"the issue of competency was mooted by the\n\ncourt\".  Hart,  supra, 933 F.2d  at 82.   Thus, the  district\n                     \n\ncourt was justified in rejecting the competence claim, either\n\nas frivolous or as not novel for purposes of the injunction.\n\n          We also  affirm  the district  court's  refusal  to\n\nallow the filing of  nine of Hart's ten other  claims.  Three\n\nof these claims  -- that the presentence report  contained an\n\nincorrect  date for  Hart's arrest,  that the  district court\n\nerred  in finding  that  Hart  made  a threat  to  intimidate\n\nwitnesses, and  that drug evidence was  materially altered in\n\nthe  government's possession -- were raised  by Hart at trial\n\nor at the sentencing hearing, and disposed of by the district\n\ncourt.   A  fourth claim  -- that  Hart was  denied effective\n\nassistance  of counsel  at  trial --  was  pressed on  Hart's\n\ndirect appeal,  and \"dismissed in perpetuity\"  by this court.\n\nId. at 83.   The district court properly rejected  these four\n  \n\nclaims  for filing,  under the  terms of  the district  court\n\ninjunction, on the ground that they were not novel.\n\n          Another five  of  these ten  claims  arguably  were\n\nraised  for the  first  time, but  could  properly have  been\n\ndismissed in any event as frivolous.  Consequently, we affirm\n\n                             -9-\n\nthe district court's rejection  of these five claims  on that\n\nbasis.   Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245 (1937) (court\n                            \n\nof appeals may affirm on any ground presented by the record).\n\nWe shall briefly discuss each of these five claims in turn.\n\n          (1)  Hart challenges  the district court's  alleged\n\nreliance in sentencing on a finding that Hart had induced his\n\nown  brother to participate in a drug conspiracy.  The record\n\nreveals, however, that at the sentencing hearing the district\n\ncourt  noted Hart's  denial of  such inducement, and  made no\n\nfurther  mention of the matter.   The record  thus shows that\n\nthis was not a factor in sentencing.\n\n          (2)   Hart asserts that  his rights were  denied at\n\ntrial  because  he  was  not  present  at  a  sidebar   bench\n\nconference   concerning  legal  objections   to  two  cocaine\n\nexhibits.  The trial transcript, however, shows that Hart did\n\nnot  object when the sidebar conference was held.  During the\n\nconference, Hart's  counsel objected to  the district court's\n\nruling as to the  two exhibits, but on direct  appeal neither\n\nHart's counsel nor Hart -- who filed a pro se brief on appeal\n\n-- raised the matter.\n\n          (3)  At the  sentencing hearing, the district court\n\nreviewed  a photocopy of a letter stating that Hart had saved\n\na  man's life.  Hart  objects that the  district court should\n\nhave required the original.  The transcript reveals  that the\n\ndistrict court  reviewed the photocopy --  which Hart himself\n\n                             -10-\n\nhad provided  -- only  after ascertaining that  neither party\n\nobjected.   Hart does  not claim that  the photocopy differed\n\nfrom the original in any way.\n\n          (4)   Hart  objects that  in closing  argument, the\n\nprosecutor stated that Hart had asserted that he had supplied\n\nmerely incense,  not cocaine.   The trial  transcript reveals\n\nthat  neither  Hart  nor  Hart's  counsel  objected  to  this\n\nstatement.    Hart's  counsel  and the  district  court  both\n\nsummarized  Hart's defense the same way.  Indeed, so did this\n\ncourt on direct appeal.  Id. at 82.\n                           \n\n          (5)   During its deliberations the jury sent a note\n\nto the court stating, \"May we have any testimony  on Count IX\n\nconcerning William Christiansen?\"   The trial judge discussed\n\nthe  matter in  chambers with  counsel for  both sides.   The\n\ncourt and counsel  identified the relevant testimony,  agreed\n\nthat the court reporter would read that testimony to the jury\n\nin open court, and agreed that the testimony would be read in\n\nthe  order it  came in at  trial.   This was done.   Hart now\n\nasserts  that  he was  not present  in  open court  when this\n\ntestimony was read to the jury, and contends that his absence\n\nviolated his right under Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a) to be present\n\n\"at every stage of the trial.\"\n\n          The government  does not discuss this  claim in its\n\nbriefs, and  thus has not  disputed Hart's assertion  that he\n\nwas  not  present  in open  court  on  this  occasion.   Even\n\n                             -11-\n\nassuming, arguendo, that  he was  not, and that  his Rule  43\n\nrights  were  violated,  there  was  clearly   no  reasonable\n\npossibility  that  his  exclusion  influenced  the  jury   in\n\nreaching  its verdict.  All  that occurred in  open court was\n\nthat the  court reporter  read to  the jury  certain excerpts\n\nfrom the trial transcript.  Hart's counsel already had agreed\n\nto these excerpts, and to the order in which they were  read.\n\nThere was nothing more that Hart himself plausibly could have\n\ndone to protect his  rights.  Although Hart contended  in his\n\nsubmission that  the choice  of excerpts was  stacked against\n\nhim,  he has  not  identified any  particular testimony  that\n\nshould have  been included but  was not.  Nor  did Hart raise\n\nthis  issue on  direct appeal, when  he filed his  own pro se\n\nbrief.   We conclude that even if we were to apply the strict\n\nharmless error standard  for constitutional deprivations, see\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.  Maraj, 947  F.2d 520, 526  (1st Cir.  1991)\n                       \n\n(noting  that this circuit has left open the question of what\n\nharmless error standard applies  in a similar situation), any\n\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          This  brings us  to the  tenth  and final  claim in\n\nHart's October 13, 1992 filing.  In that claim, Hart asserted\n\nthat  the copy  of his  presentence report  on file  with the\n\nBureau  of Prisons does not  contain a written  record of the\n\ndistrict court's  factual resolution of a  number of disputed\n\nmatters  arising out of the  presentence report that Hart had\n\n                             -12-\n\nraised at the  sentencing hearing.   Hart appended copies  of\n\nletters  from officials of the Bureau of Prisons which appear\n\nto support his  assertion.   Hart argued that  this state  of\n\naffairs violated Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(D), which requires\n\nthat  after the  sentencing court  resolves  factual disputes\n\narising out of the presentence report, \"[a] written record of\n\nsuch  findings and  determinations shall  be appended  to and\n\naccompany any copy  of the  presentence investigation  report\n\nthereafter made available to the Bureau of Prisons.\"\n\n          In its supplemental brief on appeal, the government\n\ndoes not  appear to  contest Hart's allegation  that, in  the\n\ngovernment's words, \"the Bureau of Prisons evidently does not\n\nhave in separate written form the findings and determinations\n\nthe district court made at sentencing.\"  As a remedy for this\n\ntechnical violation, the  government argues,  \"the most  that\n\nwould be required would be for the sentencing court .  . . to\n\nreduce to writing the specific findings on the disputed facts\n\nthat it made orally on the record at sentencing.\"\n\n          We can only conclude, therefore, that this claim of\n\na  Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(D) violation has not been raised\n\nbefore  and is  not so  patently insubstantial  as to  permit\n\naffirmance  based  on the  present  record.   We  accordingly\n\nreverse the district court's refusal  to permit the filing of\n\nthis single  claim.  In so  ruling, of course,  we express no\n\nview of the substantive or procedural validity of this claim.\n\n                             -13-\n\nWe merely direct the  district court to accept the  claim for\n\nfiling.\n\n          We  remand this  claim to  the district  court with\n\ndirections  that the  district court  accept for  filing this\n\nsingle  portion of  Hart's  October 13,  1992 submission  and\n\nprocess this claim in the normal course.\n\n                        Conclusion\n                                  \n\n          We have considered all of Hart's other arguments in\n\nall  three appeals, and we  reject all of  them as meritless.\n\nIn  particular, we  affirm  the district  judge's failure  to\n\nrecuse himself on the ground that at no time  has Hart stated\n\neven a colorable basis for recusal.\n\n          Hart's request that  the government's  supplemental\n\nbrief be struck is denied.  \n                         \n\n          Hart's  \"Fed. R.  App. P.  27(a) motion  to modify\"\n\nthis court's December 8,  1993 supplemental briefing order is\n\ndenied.\n      \n\n          The district court's refusal  to accept for  filing\n\nHart's  October  13,  1992  claim  of  a  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.\n\n32(c)(3)(D) violation  is reversed, and that  single claim is\n                                  \n\nremanded  to  the  district  court  for  further  proceedings\n        \n\nconsistent with  this opinion.  The  district court's rulings\n\nare in all other respects affirmed.\n                                  \n\n                             -14-\n",

With the exception of a single matter, we affirm the rulings of the district court in all three appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-1801</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conjunction with the dismissal of a Sec. 2255 petition filed by Hart, the district court, noting Hart's \"frivolous motions and duplicative pleadings which encroach on the Court's limited time and resources, ... which can only be calculated to disrupt the orderly consideration of cases, ... and which merely restate claims which have already made [sic] and which have been denied\", entered a sua sponte order on February 12, 1992, enjoining Hart from further filings in connection with his 1988 drug conviction without prior leave of court.  After Hart filed a motion on March 10, 1992, objecting that he had not been given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the injunction issued, the district court on that same date vacated its injunction \"in order to permit [Hart] to make whatever showing he can.\"  Hart was directed to file a memorandum of law on the issue within thirty days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over three months later, on June 23, 1992-after Hart had filed nothing further pertaining to the injunction-the district court issued an order reinstating the injunction,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"with slight modifications.\"  The court's order concluded as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hereby ORDERED that Wilfred Hart is enjoined from filing any motions, pleadings or papers of whatever type or description in the District of Maine, in connection with his 1988 conviction for controlled substance violations without prior leave of Court.  Hart may seek leave of Court by filing a summary of the claims he seeks to raise (not to exceed one page per claim) together with an affidavit certifying that the claims are novel and have not previously been raised before this Court or any other federal court.  Upon failure to so certify or failure to so certify truthfully, Hart may be found in contempt of court and punished accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart filed a timely notice of appeal from this injunction (appeal no. 92-1801).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[f]ederal courts plainly possess discretionary powers to regulate the conduct of abusive litigants.\"   Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993).  Accordingly, \"in extreme circumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the court and other parties, an injunction barring a party from filing and processing frivolous and vexatious lawsuits may be appropriate.\"   Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir. 1985).  We review the issuance of such an injunction for abuse of discretion.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its February 12, 1992 order, the district court set out a history of abusive, vexatious, and repetitive litigation which clearly established a need for injunctive measures.  Hart has filed petitions for collateral relief from his criminal conviction in at least three different district courts.  \"In this collateral proceeding alone,\" the district court pointed out, \"Hart has filed some twenty-seven separately docketed documents, most of which defy categorization.\"  In our opinion affirming Hart's conviction, this court also noted that before conviction, Hart at various different times had \"filed a flood of motions, many pro se,\" \"filed fifteen pro se petitions for writs of habeas corpus or related civil causes of action, all of which were denied,\" filed \"a torrent of new pro se motions,\" and \"deluged the court with at least sixty-six different motions, most of them pro se.\"   United States v. Hart, 933 F.2d 80, 81-82 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restrictions on filing \"must be tailored to the specific circumstances presented.\"   Cok, supra, 985 F.2d at 34.  Thus, we have found too sweeping an injunction against commencing any actions in the district court without prior approval, where the record did not show \"such widespread abuse of the judicial system as to warrant such a broad ... prohibition.\"   Id. at 36.  In this case, the injunction is limited to filings relating to Hart's oft-litigated 1988 federal narcotics conviction.  The injunction places no limits on any other sorts of filings.  The record amply justifies this relatively narrow proscription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart alleges a violation of his due process rights by virtue of the fact that the injunction was not requested by the government, but was entered by the court sua sponte.  Sua sponte entry of such an injunction, however, is improper only where the plaintiff is \"not warned or otherwise given notice that filing restrictions were contemplated.\"   Id. at 35.  Here, by contrast, Hart was given ample notice of the issue and ample opportunity to respond before the court finalized the injunction on June 23, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart contends that the district court improperly failed to consider his objections to the injunction, contained in a motion and accompanying memorandum Hart filed on March 10, 1992, and wrongly stated in its June 23, 1992 order that he not filed any objections.  All that the district court stated in its June 23, 1992 order, however, was that Hart had failed to file the additional memorandum of law the district court had invited him to file in its March 10, 1992 order.  In that March 10, 1992 order, the district court expressly referred to Hart's motion of that same date, and to Hart's argument in that motion and memorandum that he had not been given notice and an opportunity to respond to the district court's February 12, 1992 order.  Clearly the district court in fact did not ignore or overlook Hart's motion and memorandum.  We can presume that the court did consider the arguments Hart advanced therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart also claims that the terms of the injunction are impermissibly vague.  For example, he sees ambiguity in the requirement that he raise challenges to his 1988 conviction that \"have not previously been raised before this Court or any other federal court.\"  According to Hart, this formulation leaves it unclear whether claims he raised which in fact were never adjudicated by the federal court are covered by the injunction.  Although we leave the construction of the injunction to the district court in the first instance, we note that a dismissal of a motion or petition that does not expressly discuss issues raised in the motion or petition ordinarily would be assumed to dismiss all issues that had been raised.  We see no vagueness problem in the district court's injunction.  Hart's many other suggestions of vagueness are all without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart further claims that the injunction is based on the district court's erroneous statement in its initial February 12, 1992 order that the court by separate order had \"dealt with all pending motions in this matter.\"  Hart objects that some motions in his original Sec. 2255 petition remain undecided.  Even assuming, arguendo, that Hart were correct-an issue we need not decide here-such an error would not detract from the validity of the injunction at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-2292</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the issuance of the injunction, Hart submitted papers for filing in the district court on July 20, July 24, and September 8, 1992.  All three submissions were summarily rejected for filing on the ground that Hart did not comply with the injunction.  Hart filed a timely second notice of appeal from the third of these rejections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart challenges the district court's rejection of his proffered filings.  Since Hart's submissions were returned to him without filing, they are not in the record on appeal.  The government, however, states in its brief on appeal that with each submission Hart did not file the required accompanying affidavit certifying that the claims were novel, or the required one-page summary of each claim he sought to raise.  In his filings on appeal, Hart does not appear to contest this.  Consequently, we affirm these district court orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-2449</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, 1992, Hart filed another Sec. 2255 petition raising ten claims.  The petition gave a one-page summary of each claim, and was accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the claims were novel.  On October 20, the district court clerk sent Hart a letter stating that the district judge had summarily rejected the petition for filing on the ground that it violated the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, Hart filed an eleventh Sec. 2255 claim, alleging that Hart had not been competent to stand trial in 1988, when he was convicted.  In a November 2 order, the district court stated that Hart had complied with the injunction's requirements of an affidavit and a one-page statement regarding this claim, but that the court was \"not satisfied\" that the claim was novel.  \"In any event,\" the court concluded, \"if [Hart] failed to properly raise the issue of competence at an earlier proceeding, the issue must now be deemed waived and incapable of review by this Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 16, Hart filed a motion for leave to file a motion requesting that the court explain why Hart's October 13 filing of ten claims had been rejected for violation of the injunction.  In a December 3 order, the court denied leave to file, stating that Hart's October 13 filing of ten claims had been rejected because of Hart's \"failure to state claims that were novel and not previously raised in federal court.\"  Hart followed with his third notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's refusal to allow the filing of Hart's claim that he was not competent to stand trial.  Hart had raised this same issue at trial.  In response, the trial court had ordered psychological evaluations to look into Hart's competence, but these evaluations \"could not be completed because of Hart's intransigence,\" so \"the issue of competency was mooted by the court\".  Hart, supra, 933 F.2d at</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">82. Thus, the district court was justified in rejecting the competence claim, either as frivolous or as not novel for purposes of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also affirm the district court's refusal to allow the filing of nine of Hart's ten other claims.  Three of these claims-that the presentence report contained an incorrect date for Hart's arrest, that the district court erred in finding that Hart made a threat to intimidate witnesses, and that drug evidence was materially altered in the government's possession-were raised by Hart at trial or at the sentencing hearing, and disposed of by the district court.  A fourth claim-that Hart was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial-was pressed on Hart's direct appeal, and \"dismissed in perpetuity\" by this court.   Id. at 83.  The district court properly rejected these four claims for filing, under the terms of the district court injunction, on the ground that they were not novel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another five of these ten claims arguably were raised for the first time, but could properly have been dismissed in any event as frivolous.  Consequently, we affirm the district court's rejection of these five claims on that basis.   Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245 (1937) (court of appeals may affirm on any ground presented by the record).  We shall briefly discuss each of these five claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Hart challenges the district court's alleged reliance in sentencing on a finding that Hart had induced his own brother to participate in a drug conspiracy.  The record reveals, however, that at the sentencing hearing the district court noted Hart's denial of such inducement, and made no further mention of the matter.  The record thus shows that this was not a factor in sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Hart asserts that his rights were denied at trial because he was not present at a sidebar bench conference concerning legal objections to two cocaine exhibits.  The trial transcript, however, shows that Hart did not object when the sidebar conference was held.  During the conference, Hart's counsel objected to the district court's ruling as to the two exhibits, but on direct appeal neither Hart's counsel nor Hart-who filed a pro se brief on appeal-raised the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) At the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed a photocopy of a letter stating that Hart had saved a man's life.  Hart objects that the district court should have required the original.  The transcript reveals that the district court reviewed the photocopy-which Hart himself had provided-only after ascertaining that neither party objected.  Hart does not claim that the photocopy differed from the original in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Hart objects that in closing argument, the prosecutor stated that Hart had asserted that he had supplied merely incense, not cocaine.  The trial transcript reveals that neither Hart nor Hart's counsel objected to this statement.  Hart's counsel and the district court both summarized Hart's defense the same way.  Indeed, so did this court on direct appeal.  Id. at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) During its deliberations the jury sent a note to the court stating, \"May we have any testimony on Count IX concerning William Christiansen?\"  The trial judge discussed the matter in chambers with counsel for both sides.  The court and counsel identified the relevant testimony, agreed that the court reporter would read that testimony to the jury in open court, and agreed that the testimony would be read in the order it came in at trial.  This was done.  Hart now asserts that he was not present in open court when this testimony was read to the jury, and contends that his absence violated his right under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 43(a) to be present \"at every stage of the trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not discuss this claim in its briefs, and thus has not disputed Hart's assertion that he was not present in open court on this occasion.  Even assuming, arguendo, that he was not, and that his Rule 43 rights were violated, there was clearly no reasonable possibility that his exclusion influenced the jury in reaching its verdict.  All that occurred in open court was that the court reporter read to the jury certain excerpts from the trial transcript.  Hart's counsel already had agreed to these excerpts, and to the order in which they were read.  There was nothing more that Hart himself plausibly could have done to protect his rights.  Although Hart contended in his submission that the choice of excerpts was stacked against him, he has not identified any particular testimony that should have been included but was not.  Nor did Hart raise this issue on direct appeal, when he filed his own pro se brief.  We conclude that even if we were to apply the strict harmless error standard for constitutional deprivations,  see United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 526 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that this circuit has left open the question of what harmless error standard applies in a similar situation), any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the tenth and final claim in Hart's October 13, 1992 filing.  In that claim, Hart asserted that the copy of his presentence report on file with the Bureau of Prisons does not contain a written record of the district court's factual resolution of a number of disputed matters arising out of the presentence report that Hart had raised at the sentencing hearing.  Hart appended copies of letters from officials of the Bureau of Prisons which appear to support his assertion.  Hart argued that this state of affairs violated Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D), which requires that after the sentencing court resolves factual disputes arising out of the presentence report, \"[a] written record of such findings and determinations shall be appended to and accompany any copy of the presentence investigation report thereafter made available to the Bureau of Prisons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its supplemental brief on appeal, the government does not appear to contest Hart's allegation that, in the government's words, \"the Bureau of Prisons evidently does not have in separate written form the findings and determinations the district court made at sentencing.\"  As a remedy for this technical violation, the government argues, \"the most that would be required would be for the sentencing court ... to reduce to writing the specific findings on the disputed facts that it made orally on the record at sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can only conclude, therefore, that this claim of a Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) violation has not been raised before and is not so patently insubstantial as to permit affirmance based on the present record.  We accordingly reverse the district court's refusal to permit the filing of this single claim.  In so ruling, of course, we express no view of the substantive or procedural validity of this claim.  We merely direct the district court to accept the claim for filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand this claim to the district court with directions that the district court accept for filing this single portion of Hart's October 13, 1992 submission and process this claim in the normal course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of Hart's other arguments in all three appeals, and we reject all of them as meritless.  In particular, we affirm the district judge's failure to recuse himself on the ground that at no time has Hart stated even a colorable basis for recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart's request that the government's supplemental brief be struck is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart's \"Fed.

R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) violation is reversed, and that single claim is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The district court's rulings are in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

With the exception of a single matter, we affirm the rulings of the district court in all three appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-1801</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conjunction with the dismissal of a Sec. 2255 petition filed by Hart, the district court, noting Hart's \"frivolous motions and duplicative pleadings which encroach on the Court's limited time and resources, ... which can only be calculated to disrupt the orderly consideration of cases, ... and which merely restate claims which have already made [sic] and which have been denied\", entered a sua sponte order on February 12, 1992, enjoining Hart from further filings in connection with his 1988 drug conviction without prior leave of court.  After Hart filed a motion on March 10, 1992, objecting that he had not been given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the injunction issued, the district court on that same date vacated its injunction \"in order to permit [Hart] to make whatever showing he can.\"  Hart was directed to file a memorandum of law on the issue within thirty days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over three months later, on June 23, 1992-after Hart had filed nothing further pertaining to the injunction-the district court issued an order reinstating the injunction,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"with slight modifications.\"  The court's order concluded as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hereby ORDERED that Wilfred Hart is enjoined from filing any motions, pleadings or papers of whatever type or description in the District of Maine, in connection with his 1988 conviction for controlled substance violations without prior leave of Court.  Hart may seek leave of Court by filing a summary of the claims he seeks to raise (not to exceed one page per claim) together with an affidavit certifying that the claims are novel and have not previously been raised before this Court or any other federal court.  Upon failure to so certify or failure to so certify truthfully, Hart may be found in contempt of court and punished accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart filed a timely notice of appeal from this injunction (appeal no. 92-1801).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[f]ederal courts plainly possess discretionary powers to regulate the conduct of abusive litigants.\"   Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599290\"><a href=\"/opinion/599290/gladys-l-cok-v-family-court-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir. 1993).  Accordingly, \"in extreme circumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the court and other parties, an injunction barring a party from filing and processing frivolous and vexatious lawsuits may be appropriate.\"   Castro v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460032\"><a href=\"/opinion/460032/39-fair-emplpraccas-162-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35583-eligio-castro-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 408 (1st Cir. 1985).  We review the issuance of such an injunction for abuse of discretion.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its February 12, 1992 order, the district court set out a history of abusive, vexatious, and repetitive litigation which clearly established a need for injunctive measures.  Hart has filed petitions for collateral relief from his criminal conviction in at least three different district courts.  \"In this collateral proceeding alone,\" the district court pointed out, \"Hart has filed some twenty-seven separately docketed documents, most of which defy categorization.\"  In our opinion affirming Hart's conviction, this court also noted that before conviction, Hart at various different times had \"filed a flood of motions, many pro se,\" \"filed fifteen pro se petitions for writs of habeas corpus or related civil causes of action, all of which were denied,\" filed \"a torrent of new pro se motions,\" and \"deluged the court with at least sixty-six different motions, most of them pro se.\"   United States v. Hart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561249\"><a href=\"/opinion/561249/united-states-v-wilfred-j-hart-aka-jay-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 81-82 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restrictions on filing \"must be tailored to the specific circumstances presented.\"   Cok, supra, 985 F.2d at 34.  Thus, we have found too sweeping an injunction against commencing any actions in the district court without prior approval, where the record did not show \"such widespread abuse of the judicial system as to warrant such a broad ... prohibition.\"   Id. at 36.  In this case, the injunction is limited to filings relating to Hart's oft-litigated 1988 federal narcotics conviction.  The injunction places no limits on any other sorts of filings.  The record amply justifies this relatively narrow proscription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart alleges a violation of his due process rights by virtue of the fact that the injunction was not requested by the government, but was entered by the court sua sponte.  Sua sponte entry of such an injunction, however, is improper only where the plaintiff is \"not warned or otherwise given notice that filing restrictions were contemplated.\"   Id. at 35.  Here, by contrast, Hart was given ample notice of the issue and ample opportunity to respond before the court finalized the injunction on June 23, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart contends that the district court improperly failed to consider his objections to the injunction, contained in a motion and accompanying memorandum Hart filed on March 10, 1992, and wrongly stated in its June 23, 1992 order that he not filed any objections.  All that the district court stated in its June 23, 1992 order, however, was that Hart had failed to file the additional memorandum of law the district court had invited him to file in its March 10, 1992 order.  In that March 10, 1992 order, the district court expressly referred to Hart's motion of that same date, and to Hart's argument in that motion and memorandum that he had not been given notice and an opportunity to respond to the district court's February 12, 1992 order.  Clearly the district court in fact did not ignore or overlook Hart's motion and memorandum.  We can presume that the court did consider the arguments Hart advanced therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart also claims that the terms of the injunction are impermissibly vague.  For example, he sees ambiguity in the requirement that he raise challenges to his 1988 conviction that \"have not previously been raised before this Court or any other federal court.\"  According to Hart, this formulation leaves it unclear whether claims he raised which in fact were never adjudicated by the federal court are covered by the injunction.  Although we leave the construction of the injunction to the district court in the first instance, we note that a dismissal of a motion or petition that does not expressly discuss issues raised in the motion or petition ordinarily would be assumed to dismiss all issues that had been raised.  We see no vagueness problem in the district court's injunction.  Hart's many other suggestions of vagueness are all without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart further claims that the injunction is based on the district court's erroneous statement in its initial February 12, 1992 order that the court by separate order had \"dealt with all pending motions in this matter.\"  Hart objects that some motions in his original Sec. 2255 petition remain undecided.  Even assuming, arguendo, that Hart were correct-an issue we need not decide here-such an error would not detract from the validity of the injunction at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-2292</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the issuance of the injunction, Hart submitted papers for filing in the district court on July 20, July 24, and September 8, 1992.  All three submissions were summarily rejected for filing on the ground that Hart did not comply with the injunction.  Hart filed a timely second notice of appeal from the third of these rejections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart challenges the district court's rejection of his proffered filings.  Since Hart's submissions were returned to him without filing, they are not in the record on appeal.  The government, however, states in its brief on appeal that with each submission Hart did not file the required accompanying affidavit certifying that the claims were novel, or the required one-page summary of each claim he sought to raise.  In his filings on appeal, Hart does not appear to contest this.  Consequently, we affirm these district court orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Appeal no. 92-2449</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, 1992, Hart filed another Sec. 2255 petition raising ten claims.  The petition gave a one-page summary of each claim, and was accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the claims were novel.  On October 20, the district court clerk sent Hart a letter stating that the district judge had summarily rejected the petition for filing on the ground that it violated the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, Hart filed an eleventh Sec. 2255 claim, alleging that Hart had not been competent to stand trial in 1988, when he was convicted.  In a November 2 order, the district court stated that Hart had complied with the injunction's requirements of an affidavit and a one-page statement regarding this claim, but that the court was \"not satisfied\" that the claim was novel.  \"In any event,\" the court concluded, \"if [Hart] failed to properly raise the issue of competence at an earlier proceeding, the issue must now be deemed waived and incapable of review by this Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 16, Hart filed a motion for leave to file a motion requesting that the court explain why Hart's October 13 filing of ten claims had been rejected for violation of the injunction.  In a December 3 order, the court denied leave to file, stating that Hart's October 13 filing of ten claims had been rejected because of Hart's \"failure to state claims that were novel and not previously raised in federal court.\"  Hart followed with his third notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's refusal to allow the filing of Hart's claim that he was not competent to stand trial.  Hart had raised this same issue at trial.  In response, the trial court had ordered psychological evaluations to look into Hart's competence, but these evaluations \"could not be completed because of Hart's intransigence,\" so \"the issue of competency was mooted by the court\".  Hart, supra, 933 F.2d at</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">82. Thus, the district court was justified in rejecting the competence claim, either as frivolous or as not novel for purposes of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also affirm the district court's refusal to allow the filing of nine of Hart's ten other claims.  Three of these claims-that the presentence report contained an incorrect date for Hart's arrest, that the district court erred in finding that Hart made a threat to intimidate witnesses, and that drug evidence was materially altered in the government's possession-were raised by Hart at trial or at the sentencing hearing, and disposed of by the district court.  A fourth claim-that Hart was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial-was pressed on Hart's direct appeal, and \"dismissed in perpetuity\" by this court.   Id. at 83.  The district court properly rejected these four claims for filing, under the terms of the district court injunction, on the ground that they were not novel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another five of these ten claims arguably were raised for the first time, but could properly have been dismissed in any event as frivolous.  Consequently, we affirm the district court's rejection of these five claims on that basis.   Helvering v. Gowran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102870\"><a href=\"/opinion/102870/helvering-v-gowran/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 245 (1937) (court of appeals may affirm on any ground presented by the record).  We shall briefly discuss each of these five claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Hart challenges the district court's alleged reliance in sentencing on a finding that Hart had induced his own brother to participate in a drug conspiracy.  The record reveals, however, that at the sentencing hearing the district court noted Hart's denial of such inducement, and made no further mention of the matter.  The record thus shows that this was not a factor in sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Hart asserts that his rights were denied at trial because he was not present at a sidebar bench conference concerning legal objections to two cocaine exhibits.  The trial transcript, however, shows that Hart did not object when the sidebar conference was held.  During the conference, Hart's counsel objected to the district court's ruling as to the two exhibits, but on direct appeal neither Hart's counsel nor Hart-who filed a pro se brief on appeal-raised the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) At the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed a photocopy of a letter stating that Hart had saved a man's life.  Hart objects that the district court should have required the original.  The transcript reveals that the district court reviewed the photocopy-which Hart himself had provided-only after ascertaining that neither party objected.  Hart does not claim that the photocopy differed from the original in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Hart objects that in closing argument, the prosecutor stated that Hart had asserted that he had supplied merely incense, not cocaine.  The trial transcript reveals that neither Hart nor Hart's counsel objected to this statement.  Hart's counsel and the district court both summarized Hart's defense the same way.  Indeed, so did this court on direct appeal.  Id. at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) During its deliberations the jury sent a note to the court stating, \"May we have any testimony on Count IX concerning William Christiansen?\"  The trial judge discussed the matter in chambers with counsel for both sides.  The court and counsel identified the relevant testimony, agreed that the court reporter would read that testimony to the jury in open court, and agreed that the testimony would be read in the order it came in at trial.  This was done.  Hart now asserts that he was not present in open court when this testimony was read to the jury, and contends that his absence violated his right under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 43(a) to be present \"at every stage of the trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not discuss this claim in its briefs, and thus has not disputed Hart's assertion that he was not present in open court on this occasion.  Even assuming, arguendo, that he was not, and that his Rule 43 rights were violated, there was clearly no reasonable possibility that his exclusion influenced the jury in reaching its verdict.  All that occurred in open court was that the court reporter read to the jury certain excerpts from the trial transcript.  Hart's counsel already had agreed to these excerpts, and to the order in which they were read.  There was nothing more that Hart himself plausibly could have done to protect his rights.  Although Hart contended in his submission that the choice of excerpts was stacked against him, he has not identified any particular testimony that should have been included but was not.  Nor did Hart raise this issue on direct appeal, when he filed his own pro se brief.  We conclude that even if we were to apply the strict harmless error standard for constitutional deprivations,  see United States v. Maraj, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 526 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that this circuit has left open the question of what harmless error standard applies in a similar situation), any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the tenth and final claim in Hart's October 13, 1992 filing.  In that claim, Hart asserted that the copy of his presentence report on file with the Bureau of Prisons does not contain a written record of the district court's factual resolution of a number of disputed matters arising out of the presentence report that Hart had raised at the sentencing hearing.  Hart appended copies of letters from officials of the Bureau of Prisons which appear to support his assertion.  Hart argued that this state of affairs violated Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D), which requires that after the sentencing court resolves factual disputes arising out of the presentence report, \"[a] written record of such findings and determinations shall be appended to and accompany any copy of the presentence investigation report thereafter made available to the Bureau of Prisons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its supplemental brief on appeal, the government does not appear to contest Hart's allegation that, in the government's words, \"the Bureau of Prisons evidently does not have in separate written form the findings and determinations the district court made at sentencing.\"  As a remedy for this technical violation, the government argues, \"the most that would be required would be for the sentencing court ... to reduce to writing the specific findings on the disputed facts that it made orally on the record at sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can only conclude, therefore, that this claim of a Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) violation has not been raised before and is not so patently insubstantial as to permit affirmance based on the present record.  We accordingly reverse the district court's refusal to permit the filing of this single claim.  In so ruling, of course, we express no view of the substantive or procedural validity of this claim.  We merely direct the district court to accept the claim for filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remand this claim to the district court with directions that the district court accept for filing this single portion of Hart's October 13, 1992 submission and process this claim in the normal course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of Hart's other arguments in all three appeals, and we reject all of them as meritless.  In particular, we affirm the district judge's failure to recuse himself on the ground that at no time has Hart stated even a colorable basis for recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart's request that the government's supplemental brief be struck is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hart's \"Fed.  R. App.  P. 27(a) motion to modify\" this court's December 8, 1993 supplemental briefing order is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's refusal to accept for filing Hart's October 13, 1992 claim of a Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) violation is reversed, and that single claim is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The district court's rulings are in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
