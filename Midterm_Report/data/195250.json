John Pappalardo,  United  States Attorney,  and  Dina  Michael\n                                                                  \nChaitowitz, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n      \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.  Angel Luis Figueroa appeals pro se from the\n               \n\ndenial of  a motion  under 28  U.S.C.   2255  to vacate,  set\n\naside,  or  correct  his  sentence.    In  1990,  upon  being\n\nconvicted of  both conspiring and attempting  to possess with\n\nintent to distribute  500 or more grams  of cocaine, Figueroa\n\nwas sentenced to  a prison term  of 188  months.  This  court\n\nthereafter  affirmed both  his conviction  and his  sentence.\n\nUnited  States v. Figueroa,  976 F.2d  1446 (1st  Cir. 1992),\n                          \n\ncert.  denied, 113 S. Ct. 1346 (1993).  Figueroa now advances\n             \n\na pair of challenges  to his sentence, claiming that  (1) the\n\nquantity of  drugs  for which  he  was held  accountable  was\n\nimproperly  inflated because  of \"sentencing  entrapment\" and\n\nother reasons, and (2) his base offense level was  improperly\n\nenhanced  by four  levels because  of his  alleged leadership\n\nrole.  As a  corollary complaint, he argues that  his counsel\n\nwas  ineffective in  failing to  raise these  issues earlier.\n\nAssuming arguendo that such contentions are cognizable in a  \n                 \n\n2255  proceeding,  we  find  each of  them  unpersuasive  and\n\ntherefore affirm.\n\n     As explained  in greater detail in  our earlier opinion,\n\nFigueroa and his confederates were apprehended as a result of\n\na   \"reverse-sting\"   operation  involving   their  attempted\n\npurchase of drugs from an  informant for the Drug Enforcement\n\nAgency  (Estaban Mendoza).  See  id. at 1450-51.   During the\n                                    \n\ncourse of his  negotiations with Mendoza,  Figueroa discussed\n\npurchasing anywhere from three  to five kilograms of cocaine,\n\nexplaining   that   his   organization   had   been   selling\n\napproximately  $6,000 worth  of the  drug per  day in  \"dime\"\n\nbags.   The  parties  settled upon  an  initial sale  of  two\n\nkilograms, with  $30,000 being  paid up-front and  $10,000 to\n\nfollow.  The sum of $29,850 was in fact seized at the time of\n\narrest.   At sentencing,  the court determined  that Figueroa\n\nwas  responsible not only  for the two  kilograms involved in\n\nthe attempted  sale, but for an additional three kilograms as\n\nwell.  This  latter figure was  reached by extrapolating  the\n\napproximate amount of cocaine  distributed over the course of\n\nthe  conspiracy  based  on Figueroa's  acknowledged  sales of\n\n$6,000 per  day.1  Figueroa now contends that it was error to\n\nhold  him  accountable for  five  kilograms  for purposes  of\n\nsentencing.  \n\n     The basis for this challenge is amorphous in nature.  In\n\nhis petition, Figueroa devotes considerable attention to  the\n\nnotion  of   \"sentencing  entrapment\"  (or,   more  properly,\n\n\"sentencing  factor manipulation\").  Whatever the theoretical\n\nviability of  such a  doctrine, see, e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nBrewster, 1 F.3d  51, 55  (1st Cir. 1993);  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nPanet-Collazo, 960  F.2d 256,  262 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n1.  The  indictment  charged  that  the  conspiracy  occurred\nbetween December 24, 1989 and January 25, 1990.   A DEA agent\ntestified  that  one  kilogram   of  cocaine  would  generate\napproximately $70,000  when distributed in \"dime\"  bags.  See\n                                                             \n976 F.2d at 1461 n.19.\n\n                             -3-\n\n113 S. Ct.  220 (1992);  United States v.  Connell, 960  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n191,  194-97 (1st Cir. 1992)  (all rejecting such  a claim on\n\nbasis  of  facts presented),  the  instant  case provides  no\n\noccasion to address it.   Figueroa's claim in this  regard is\n\nbased  on  the  misimpression   that  the  additional   three\n\nkilograms  in  question  were   those  that  he  and  Mendoza\n\ndiscussed for possible sale during their negotiations (beyond\n\nthe  two  kilograms  actually  agreed  upon).    Instead,  as\n\nmentioned, this  figure reflected the quantity  of drugs that\n\nFigueroa had  admitted selling to others  during the previous\n\nmonth.  Figueroa  specifically disclaims any  suggestion that\n\nthe two  kilograms involved  in the  attempted sale  were the\n\nsubject of \"manipulation.\"  And any such argument would  have\n\nfaltered for the reasons recited in Brewster, 1 F.3d at 55.\n                                            \n\n     In a related  (if inconsistent) vein, Figueroa  contends\n\nthat the  evidence was  insufficient to hold  him responsible\n\nfor the three kilograms sold  by his organization during  the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy.  We rejected the identical argument\n\non  direct  appeal.   Referring to  (Angel) Figueroa  and his\n\nbrother Tomas, we stated:\n\n     Tomas, as well as Angel, admitted that $6,000 worth\n     of \"dime\"  bags were  being sold daily  through the\n     record   shop   during   the  alleged   conspiracy.\n     Although  appellants characterize  these statements\n     as  mere \"puffery,\" the  sentencing judge who heard\n     the trial  testimony was  entitled to  credit their\n     admissions.  The court permissibly extrapolated the\n     approximate  amount  of cocaine  distributed during\n     the  relevant period  based  on the  sums of  money\n     admittedly received.   There was no  clear error in\n\n                             -4-\n\n     the determination of  the quantity  of cocaine  for\n     which Angel and Tomas Figueroa were responsible.\n\n976 F.2d at 1460-61 (citations and footnotes omitted).\n\n     Figueroa's challenge to the determination  regarding his\n\nrole  in the  offense is  likewise unavailing.   The district\n\ncourt  held  that  he  was  \"an organizer  or  leader\"  under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3B1.1(a)  and thus  was  subject to  a four-level\n\nenhancement.    On  appeal,  Figueroa argues  only  that  the\n\nevidence  was insufficient  to establish  that he  occupied a\n\nleadership role.   To  the contrary,  as our  earlier opinion\n\namply  demonstrates, see  976 F.2d  at 1450-51,  the district\n                        \n\ncourt  supportably  found  that  he  \"directed  ...  all  the\n\nactivities  of  his co-conspirators\"  and  that  he was  \"the\n\ncontrolling participant in negotiating the amount [of cocaine\n\nto  be  purchased],  the  price,  and  the  arrangements  for\n\ndelivery of the  money to the confidential informant.\"   App.\n\n44.   \"Role  in the  offense\" determinations  are subject  to\n\nreview only for  clear error.   See, e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nRuiz-Del Valle, 8 F.3d 98, 104 (1st Cir. 1993).  We find none\n              \n\nhere.\n\n     Finally, as each of Figueroa's central arguments  proves\n\nwanting,  his  subsidiary  allegations regarding  ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel must also fail. \n\n     Affirmed.   \n              \n\n                             -5-\n",

Figueroa's claim in this regard is based on the misimpression that the additional three kilograms in question were those that he and Mendoza discussed for possible sale during their negotiations (beyond the two kilograms actually agreed upon).  Instead, as mentioned, this figure reflected the quantity of drugs that Figueroa had admitted selling to others during the previous month.  Figueroa specifically disclaims any suggestion that the two kilograms involved in the attempted sale were the subject of \"manipulation.\"  And any such argument would have faltered for the reasons recited in  Brewster, 1 F.3d at 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related (if inconsistent) vein, Figueroa contends that the evidence was insufficient to hold him responsible for the three kilograms sold by his organization during the course of the conspiracy.  We rejected the identical argument on direct appeal.  Referring to (Angel) Figueroa and his brother Tomas, we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomas, as well as Angel, admitted that $6,000 worth of \"dime\" bags were being sold daily through the record shop during the alleged conspiracy.  Although appellants characterize these statements as mere \"puffery,\" the sentencing judge who heard the trial testimony was entitled to credit their admissions.  The court permissibly extrapolated the approximate amount of cocaine distributed during the relevant period based on the sums of money admittedly received.  There was no clear error in the determination of the quantity of cocaine for which Angel and Tomas Figueroa were responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">976 F.2d at 1460-61 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa's challenge to the determination regarding his role in the offense is likewise unavailing.  The district court held that he was \"an organizer or leader\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a) and thus was subject to a four-level enhancement.  On appeal, Figueroa argues only that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he occupied a leadership role.  To the contrary, as our earlier opinion amply demonstrates, see 976 F.2d at 1450-51, the district court supportably found that he \"directed ... all the activities of his co-conspirators\" and that he was \"the controlling participant in negotiating the amount [of cocaine to be purchased], the price, and the arrangements for delivery of the money to the confidential informant.\"  App. 44.  \"Role in the offense\" determinations are subject to review only for clear error.   See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz-Del Valle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195004\"><a href=\"/opinion/195004/united-states-v-del-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir. 1993).  We find none here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as each of Figueroa's central arguments proves wanting, his subsidiary allegations regarding ineffective assistance of counsel must also fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment charged that the conspiracy occurred between December 24, 1989 and January 25, 1990.  A DEA agent testified that one kilogram of cocaine would generate approximately $70,000 when distributed in \"dime\" bags.  See 976 F.2d at 1461 n. 19</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
