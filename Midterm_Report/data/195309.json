This case  probes the frontiers\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\nof the  doctrine of  personal jurisdiction  in a  context fraught\n\nwith  constitutional implications.    The issue,  simply put,  is\n\nthis:   Can a Massachusetts-based  court, consistent with the Due\n\nProcess Clause,  assert jurisdiction over  a California  resident\n\nwho  is alleged  to  have made  a  defamatory comment  during  an\n\nunsolicited  telephone  interview with  a  staff  reporter for  a\n\nMassachusetts newspaper?  We conclude, on the facts of this case,\n\nthat the lower court correctly disclaimed jurisdiction.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Inasmuch as the district  court dismissed this suit for\n\nfailure of  the plaintiff to  make a  prima facie  jurisdictional\n                                                 \n\nshowing, see Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1992), we draw the facts from the pleadings and the parties'\n\nsupplementary   filings,   including  affidavits,   taking  facts\n\naffirmatively  alleged  by  plaintiff   as  true  and  construing\n\ndisputed facts in  the light  most hospitable to  plaintiff.   Of\n\ncourse,  we   do  not  credit  conclusory   allegations  or  draw\n\nfarfetched  inferences.    See  generally  Dartmouth  Review   v.\n                                                            \n\nDartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989) (discussing line\n               \n\nbetween \"facts\"  and \"conclusions\" for  purposes of  a motion  to\n\ndismiss).\n\n          Defendant-appellee  Joseph  M.  Alioto  is  an attorney\n\npracticing  in California.    Among his  other  cases, Alioto  is\n\npressing  a  class  action   in  the  California  courts  against\n\nTicketmaster-Southern  California,   Inc.   (T-SC).     T-SC,   a\n\n                                2\n\nCalifornia-based corporation, is affiliated with Ticketmaster-New\n\nYork,  Inc. (T-NY),  a Delaware  corporation.   Both Ticketmaster\n\nentities  are  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling ducats  to\n\nentertainment events.\n\n          The  litigation  between  T-NY  and  Alioto  finds  its\n\ngenesis in the decision  by the Boston Globe, a  daily newspaper,\n                                            \n\nto  undertake   an  investigation   into  pricing  practices   on\n\n\"Ticketmaster's\"  part.1   In  conducting  this investigation,  a\n\nGlobe reporter conversed by telephone with Alioto.  The plaintiff\n     \n\ndoes not allege,  and the  record does not  suggest, that  Alioto\n\ndialed the telephone or otherwise initiated the call.  The record\n\nis equally  barren  of  any  showing that  Alioto  solicited  the\n\ninquiry2  or that  more than  one call  occurred.   It  is clear,\n\nnevertheless,  that  Alioto, who  was  in  California, knew  when\n\nspeaking  that  his  comments would  inform  a  story  slated for\n\npublication in a newspaper circulated chiefly in Massachusetts.\n\n          The investigation  culminated  in a  front-page  expose\n\nthat  hit the newsstands on Sunday, September 20, 1992, under the\n\nbanner headline,  \"Rising ticket fees pad concert  profits.\"  The\n\nensuing article contained  over fifty paragraphs.   Well past the\n\nmidpoint, the article mentioned  mounting complaints about  price\n\n                    \n\n     1The article that capped this investigation makes no attempt\nto distinguish among corporate entities (although it contains one\nvague  reference to  \"Ticketmaster and its  affiliates\").   At no\npoint does the article refer by name to either T-NY or T-SC.\n\n     2Although there is  a passing  allusion in the  record to  a\npress  release issued by Alioto regarding  the lawsuit against T-\nSC,  there is  no indication  that he  forwarded this  release to\nMassachusetts or that it sparked the Globe's story.\n                                          \n\n                                3\n\ngouging in New York and California.  It then reported that \"three\n\nclass action antitrust lawsuits\" had recently been filed \"against\n\nTicketmaster\" in California.  There followed the paragraph around\n\nwhich this controversy revolves  (buried deep in the body  of the\n\narticle).   We quote  the allegedly offending  paragraph in full,\n\nand,  in the  interests  of context,  add  the beginning  of  the\n\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n               Attorney Joseph M. Alioto, who filed one\n          of the suits, charged that kickbacks are  the\n          key  to  Ticketmaster's California  monopoly.\n          \"They're nothing more than a straight bribe,\"\n          he said.\n               Ticketmaster and its affiliates  took on\n          their   California  adversaries   in  typical\n          aggressive fashion, . . .\n\n          Based  on  this  reported comment,  T-NY  brought  suit\n\nagainst  Alioto  in the  United  States  District Court  for  the\n\nDistrict  of Massachusetts.   Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28\n\nU.S.C.    1332 (1988), it alleged that Alioto, with the requisite\n\nintent, conveyed and/or caused  to be conveyed certain defamatory\n\nimpressions of and  concerning T-NY, namely, that T-NY engaged in\n\nbribery and related criminal conduct.\n\n          In due season, Alioto moved to dismiss.  T-NY objected.\n\nThe district judge heard  oral argument and dismissed  the action\n\nfor lack  of in personam jurisdiction,  concluding that appellant\n                        \n\nfailed  to make  the  requisite showing  at  every stage  of  the\n\nobligatory jurisdictional inquiry  under the due  process clause.\n\nSee United Electrical Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1080, 1089 (1st Cir. 1992) (Pleasant St. I) (discussing nature of\n                                          \n\nrequisite inquiry).   Two perceptions figured  prominently in the\n\n                                4\n\ndistrict  court's  reasoning.    First,  the  defendant  did  not\n\nactively  shape  and focus  the  reporter's  story, but,  rather,\n\npassively  responded to a telephone call.   Second, the allegedly\n\ndefamatory  comment dealt  with  the California  activities of  a\n\nCalifornia corporation, T-SC, and did not pertain to T-NY.\n\n          Plaintiff appeals.   Because the court  below dismissed\n\nthe  case  on legal  grounds,  without  convening an  evidentiary\n\nhearing  or resolving contested  evidentiary questions, appellate\n\nreview is plenary.  See United Electrical Workers v. 163 Pleasant\n                                                                 \n\nSt. Corp., 987  F.2d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1993) (Pleasant St. II);\n                                                               \n\nBoit, 967 F.2d at 675.   In conducting this tamisage, we  are not\n    \n\nwedded  to the  district  court's rationale,  but remain  free to\n\naffirm the judgment below  on any independently sufficient ground\n\nmade manifest by the record.   See  Martel v. Stafford,  992 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1244, 1245 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          To subject a non-resident defendant to its jurisdiction\n\nin a  diversity case, a court    and for this  purpose, a federal\n\ncourt  exercising  diversity   jurisdiction  is  the   functional\n\nequivalent  of  a state  court sitting  in  the forum  state, see\n                                                                 \n\nGeneral Contracting  &amp; Trading Co.  v. Interpole, Inc.,  940 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n20,  23 n.4  (1st Cir. 1991)    must  find contacts  that, in the\n\naggregate,  satisfy the  requirements of  both the  forum state's\n\nlong-arm  statute and  the Fourteenth  Amendment.3   See Pleasant\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3To  be sure,  the  extent of  the necessary  jurisdictional\nshowing  varies   depending  upon  whether   a  litigant  asserts\njurisdiction over an adverse party under a theory of \"general\" or\n\n                                5\n\nSt. I, 960 F.2d at 1086 (\"In Massachusetts, a court may  exercise\n     \n\npersonal   jurisdiction  over   a  foreign   defendant  if   such\n\njurisdiction  is authorized  by  state statute  or  rule and  its\n                                                            \n\nexercise does not offend due process.\"); Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T.\n                                                                 \n\nShoe Mfg.  Co., 764 F.2d 928, 931 (1st Cir. 1985) (similar).  The\n              \n\ndistrict court  determined that  T-NY satisfied neither  of these\n\ntwo prerequisites. We explore these determinations.\n\n                      A.  The State Statute.\n                                           \n\n          The applicable Massachusetts statute,  familiarly known\n\nas \"section 3(c),\" deals with torts committed by persons who have\n\nno  ongoing relationship with the  forum state.   The language of\n\nthis provision  tracks the Uniform  Interstate and  International\n\nProcedure Act,  and  differs  significantly  from  other  leading\n\nformulations.   See Murphy  v. Erwin-Wasey,  Inc., 460  F.2d 661,\n                                                 \n\n663-64  (1st Cir.  1972); see  also Margoles  v. Johns,  483 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1212, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  The statute states:\n\n               A    court    may   exercise    personal\n          jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly\n          or  by an agent, as  to a cause  of action in\n          law or equity arising from the person's . . .\n                 (c)  causing tortious injury by an act\n          or omission in this Commonwealth . . . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A,   3 (1986).\n\n          Although  the lower court did not reach the question of\n\njurisdiction under state  law, we have pondered  whether the case\n\nmight more appropriately be dispatched on that basis.  After all,\n\n                    \n\n\"specific\"  jurisdiction.    See  Donatelli  v.  National  Hockey\n                                                                 \nLeague,  893  F.2d  459,  462-63  (1st  Cir.  1990)  (elucidating\n      \nstandards and  enumerating differences).   Here, plaintiff's case\nstands or falls on a theory of specific jurisdiction.\n\n                                6\n\n\"[i]t has long been a basic tenet of the federal courts to eschew\n\nthe decision of cases on  constitutional grounds unless and until\n\nall other available avenues of resolution [have been] exhausted.\"\n\nAggarwal v. Ponce Sch.  of Medicine, 745 F.2d 723,  726 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1984).  But  here, as we explain below, the  state-law issues are\n\nextremely  murky.  Thus, on  balance, we agree  with the district\n\ncourt that it makes sense to  resolve the jurisdictional question\n\non constitutional grounds.\n\n          In the  first place,  although logic suggests  that, on\n\nthese facts, the defendant  cannot be said to have  performed \"an\n\nact\" in  Massachusetts, that suggestion is  not easily reconciled\n\nwith  Murphy.   There, we  ruled that  an allegedly  tortious act\n            \n\ncommitted  outside the  borders  of  Massachusetts,  purposefully\n\ndirected at the state  and intended to cause injury  there, could\n\nconstitute an  in-forum act within  the meaning of  section 3(c).\n\nSee Murphy, 460  F.2d at 664.  While Murphy  can be distinguished\n                                           \n\non the  ground that it  was decided in the  context of fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, as opposed  to defamation,4 its interpretation\n\nof section  3(c) is worded  in general  terms and its  reasoning \n\nconceivably could  be  transferred  to  the  defamation  context.\n\nDespite  our  profound  reservations about  extending  the Murphy\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     4Appellant argues  that we  have already extended  Murphy to\n                                                              \nthe  defamation arena  in Hugel v.  McNell, 886 F.2d  1 (1st Cir.\n                                          \n1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1079 (1990).  We do not think Hugel\n                                                                 \nmust  necessarily be  read so  broadly.   That case  turned on  a\nconstruction  of the  New Hampshire  long-arm statute,  N.H. Rev.\nStat.  Ann.   510:4 (1993), and the New Hampshire statute, unlike\nits Massachusetts  counterpart, does  not embody the  language of\nthe Uniform Act.\n\n                                7\n\nrationale,5 it spreads  a shadow of  uncertainty over the  state-\n\nlaw issues.\n\n          In  the second  place,  because we  are skeptical  that\n\ndefendant made  any remark  \"of and  concerning\" T-NY, we  harbor\n\ndoubts  whether  defendant  can  be said  to  have  inflicted any\n\n\"tortious injury\" within the  meaning of section 3(c).6   We are,\n\nhowever, hesitant to move beyond an expression of skepticism.  At\n\nthis  stage of the proceedings, appellant has not had the benefit\n\nof  an  evidentiary hearing  or  a  comparable opportunity  (say,\n\naccess  to  the  full-dress  summary judgment  protocol  after  a\n\nreasonable period of  discovery) for presenting proof.   Thus, it\n\nmay be too early to reach the state-law issues.\n\n          To be sure, our reservations about one or both of these\n\n                    \n\n     5Intuitively, it would seem hard to characterize the act  of\npublishing an allegedly defamatory remark outside the forum state\nas an act  within the forum state.   In fact, no  fewer than five\ncourts applying long-arm statutes patterned after the Uniform Act\nhave eschewed  Murphy's reasoning  in the defamation  context and\n                     \ndeclined to assert  jurisdiction on  this basis.

We know to\n\na certainty  only  that  the requirement  focuses  on  the  nexus\n\nbetween  the defendant's  contacts and  the plaintiff's  cause of\n\naction.\n\n          The Court has kept  its own counsel on the  question of\n\nwhether,  on  the one  hand, the  two  halves of  the relatedness\n\n                                10\n\nrequirement are merely  two ways of  expressing the same  thought\n\nor, on the other  hand, they are meant to import different values\n\ninto the  jurisdictional equation.

For  our  part,  we think  it\n\nsignificant that the constitutional catchphrase is disjunctive in\n\nnature, referring  to suits \"aris[ing] out of, or relat[ing] to,\"\n                                                 \n\nin-forum activities.

A number of other courts\n\nshare this belief.  See, e.g., City of Virginia Beach v.

In our  view,  these cases    which\ninterpret  the term \"arising  from\" as that  term is used  in the\nlong-arm statutes of Massachusetts,  see Fournier v. Best Western\n                                                                 \nTreasure Island Resort, 962 F.2d 126, 127 (1st Cir. 1992); Marino\n                                                                 \nv.

Second,  it ensures that the element\n\nof  causation  remains  in  the  forefront  of  the  due  process\n\ninvestigation.   Even if the facts are  such that a court may not\n\ndismiss  a given  case  for  lack  of  relatedness  per  se,  the\n                                                           \n\nrelatedness   requirement,  in   serving  its   second  function,\n\nauthorizes  the  court  to take  into  account  the strength  (or\n\nweakness) of the plaintiff's  relatedness showing in passing upon\n\nthe fundamental fairness of allowing the suit to proceed.\n\n          In this  vein, it is important to  recognize that, when\n\nthe defendant  in a defamation  action is a  journalist's source,\n\nthe  link between the defendant's conduct and the cause of action\n\nis  attenuated by  the intervening  activities of  third parties,\n\ne.g.,  the reporter, the editor, the media outlet, and that those\n    \n\nintermediaries  shape,  amplify,  and  occasionally  distort  the\n\noriginal  utterance.    This case  illustrates  the  point.   The\n\noriginal  comment, technically  a  tort in  its   own  right  (if\n\ndefamatory),  inflicted no significant  injury, except insofar as\n\nit  led to republication in  the ensuing newspaper  article   and\n\nthe form  and tone of the republication was not by any stretch of\n\nthe  most  active  imagination within  the  defendant's effective\n\ncontrol.\n\n          2.   Purposeful Availment.   The question  here must be\n          2.   Purposeful Availment.\n                                   \n\nphrased  in terms of whether  an individual who  merely answers a\n\ntelephone  call,  but,  having  done so,  knowingly  directs  his\n\ncomments into the forum  state, may be said to  have purposefully\n\n                                12\n\navailed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in  the\n\nstate.9\n\n          To answer the question, we begin by considering McBreen\n                                                                 \n\nv. Beech Aircraft Corp., 543 F.2d 26 (7th Cir. 1976), a case that\n                       \n\nthe district court thought highly pertinent and that Alioto touts\n\nas dispositive.  There,  the Seventh Circuit refused to  sanction\n\nthe   exercise   of   jurisdiction  because   the   defendant,  a\n\njournalistic source,  did not  initiate the  defamatory exchange,\n\nand, being  unaware of either  the reporter's whereabouts  or the\n\nmagazine's  reach, could  not reasonably  have foreseen  that his\n\ncomment would cause injury in the forum state.  See id. at 28.\n                                                       \n\n          The  two conditions  identified  as salient  in McBreen\n                                                                 \n\ncorrespond to the two  cornerstones of purposeful availment.  One\n\ncornerstone is foreseeability.  See,  e.g., Escude Cruz v.  Ortho\n                                                                 \n\nPharmaceutical Corp., 619 F.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir. 1980); see also\n                                                                 \n\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

The burden of\nproving jurisdictional facts rests on the shoulders  of the party\nwho  seeks to  invoke the  court's jurisdiction.   See  McNutt v.\n                                                              \nGeneral  Motors  Acceptance  Corp.,  298 U.S.  178,  189  (1936);\n                                  \nMartel, 992 F.2d at 1247  n.5; Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d  at 1090.\n                                             \nOn this principle, and in the absence of even a representation or\nfirm  allegation to  the contrary,  we must  presume, as  did the\ncourt below,  that  Alioto  played  no  part  in  initiating  the\ntelephone call.\n\n                                13\n\nvoluntariness.  See   Vencedor Mfg. Co. v. Gougler  Indus., Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n557 F.2d  886, 891 (1st Cir. 1977); see also Burger King Corp. v.\n                                                              \n\nRudziewicz,   471   U.S.  462,   475   (1985)   (cautioning  that\n          \n\njurisdiction may not  rest on the \"unilateral activity of another\n\nparty  or a third person\").   In McBreen,  these two cornerstones\n                                        \n\nwere  poorly  laid:   a failed  showing  of foreseeability  and a\n\nquestionable  showing   of  voluntariness  combined  to  form  an\n\ninsufficiently  sturdy   foundation   to  support   in   personam\n                                                                 \n\njurisdiction.   The instant  case, which amalgamates  an arguably\n\nsuccessful showing  of foreseeability  with a dubious  showing of\n\nvoluntariness, is a  closer call.   We turn,  then, to a  broader\n\nsurvey of analogous case law.\n\n          Courts are  consentient that  when, as in  McBreen, the\n                                                            \n\nsource  of an allegedly  defamatory remark  did not  initiate the\n\npivotal  contact,  and  the  in-forum injury  is  not  reasonably\n\nforeseeable,  jurisdiction may  not be  asserted over  the source\n\nbased on  the comment.10   See, e.g.,  Madara v.

See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nWoodson,  444 U.S. at 292;  International Shoe, 326  U.S. at 320.\n                                              \n\n\"This  means that,  even  where  purposefully generated  contacts\n\nexist, courts must consider a panoply of other factors which bear\n\nupon the fairness of subjecting a nonresident to the authority of\n\na foreign  tribunal.\"  Pleasant St.  I, 960 F.2d  at 1088; accord\n                                                                 \n\nDonatelli,  893 F.2d at 464-65.  The Supreme Court has identified\n         \n\nfive  such  factors,  namely,   (1)  the  defendant's  burden  of\n\nappearing,  (2) the  forum state's  interest in  adjudicating the\n\ndispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and\n\neffective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining\n\n                    \n\n     12Withal,  we  recognize  that  a  person  speaking  on  the\ntelephone is free to refrain from making defamatory statements in\nthe same way that a person standing beside a telephone is free to\nrefrain from calling a  reporter.

We have\n                                   \n\nlabelled this group of considerations the \"gestalt factors.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nPleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088; Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 465.\n                                           \n\n          The  gestalt factors  are not  ends in  themselves, but\n\nthey are, collectively, a means of  assisting courts in achieving\n\nsubstantial  justice.   In  very close  cases,  they may  tip the\n\nconstitutional  balance.   See Burger  King, 471  U.S. at  477-78\n                                           \n\n(explaining that \"minimum requirements inherent in the concept of\n\n'fair play and substantial justice' may defeat the reasonableness\n\nof jurisdiction even if the defendant has purposefully engaged in\n\nforum  activities\") (citation  omitted).

See  id. at 114-15.   In  the\n                                            \n\nestimation   of  at  least   four  Justices,   considerations  of\n\nreasonableness  sufficed  to defeat  jurisdiction notwithstanding\n\nthat the defendant purposefully  engaged in activities within the\n\nforum.    See id.  at 116-17  (separate  opinion of  Brennan, J.,\n                 \n\njoined by White,  Marshall, &amp; Blackmun,  JJ.).

The gestalt factors have been\n\napplied by the Court  only once (in Asahi); beyond  mere mention,\n                                         \n\nthey  have  been discussed  on rare  occasions  by the  courts of\n\nappeals,  see, e.g., Gould v.

Lee,  Burger  King's Bifurcated  Test  for\n                                                                 \n\nPersonal  Jurisdiction, 66  Temp. L.  Rev. 945  (1993) (surveying\n                      \n\ncircuits).   That circuit  has  concluded that  dismissal may  be\n\nappropriate  on grounds of  reasonableness even if considerations\n\nof  relatedness  or  purposefulness,  taken  in  isolation, could\n\nsupport the  exercise of  jurisdiction.   See Fields v.

Commonwealth Edison Co., 805\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 834,  840 (9th  Cir. 1986)  (limning Ninth Circuit's  multi-\n\nfactor reasonableness test).\n\n          We agree in principle with the Ninth Circuit.  We hold,\n\ntherefore,  that  the  Due  Process  Clause  bars  a  court  from\n\nasserting jurisdiction over the person of a defendant if doing so\n\n                                19\n\nwould be fundamentally unfair.  In this context, gauging fairness\n\nrequires  an   assessment  of  reasonableness  for,   in  certain\n\ncircumstances, unreasonableness can  trump a minimally sufficient\n\nshowing of  relatedness and purposefulness.   We think, moreover,\n\nthat the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a\n\nsliding scale:  the  weaker the plaintiff's showing on  the first\n\ntwo  prongs (relatedness  and purposeful  availment), the  less a\n\ndefendant  need  show  in  terms of  unreasonableness  to  defeat\n\njurisdiction.  The reverse is equally true:  an especially strong\n\nshowing  of  reasonableness may  serve  to  fortify a  borderline\n\nshowing of  relatedness and  purposefulness.  See  Donatelli, 893\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 465.  It is  against this backdrop, then, that we proceed\n\nto sift the gestalt factors.13\n\n          a.   The Burden  of Appearance.   The burden associated\n          a.

This\n\nburden, and its inevitable concomitant, great  inconvenience, are\n\nentitled to substantial weight in calibrating the  jurisdictional\n\nscales.   Indeed, the Court  has stated that  this element, alone\n\n                    \n\n     13The approach  that we endorse today  differs slightly from\nthat of the Ninth Circuit, which has crafted its own version of a\nsliding scale approach.   The Ninth Circuit's  methodology, as we\nunderstand it,  incorporates the  element of  purposefulness into\nthe  third  prong  of the  inquiry,  and  weighs  it against  the\nremaining considerations of reasonableness.

It is\n\nthe rare libel case in which both the newspaper and the reporter,\n\nthough amenable to process, are relegated to the sidelines at the\n\nbehest  of an avowedly defamed  plaintiff.

Interest of  the Forum.   The  forum  state has  a\n          b.   Interest of  the Forum.\n                                     \n\ndemonstrable  interest in  exercising jurisdiction  over one  who\n\ncauses tortious injury within its borders.  See Keeton v. Hustler\n                                                                 \n\nMagazine, Inc.,  465 U.S.  770, 776  (1984).   Though we deem  it\n              \n\ninappropriate  to   correlate   the  strength   or  weakness   of\n\nappellant's case on the  merits with the strength or  weakness of\n\n                                22\n\nthe forum state's interest  in this regard,  we think it is  both\n\nappropriate  and  useful  to  note  two  special  considerations.\n\nFirst, the  Commonwealth's interest in the  litigation sub judice\n                                                                 \n\nis  arguably   lessened   by  the   doubts  surrounding   whether\n\ndefendant's act can be said to  have been committed in the forum,\n\nsee supra  p.  7.    Second, if  appellant  in  fact  filed  suit\n         \n\nprimarily to  retaliate against  Alioto's role in  the California\n\nlitigation rather than  to right  an independent wrong    and  as\n\npreviously  mentioned there  are some  clues in  the record  that\n\ncould lead  to such  a  deduction    the Commonwealth's  interest\n\nwould be much diminished.   Cf., e.g., Asahi, 480 U.S.  at 114-15\n                                            \n\n(minimizing  forum state's  interest  in protecting  its citizens\n\nfrom  tortious  injury because  a  dispute  was \"primarily  about\n\nindemnification rather than safety standards\").  Mindful of these\n\nspecial considerations, we conclude  that the forum has a  milder\n\nthan usual interest in the further prosecution of T-NY's suit.\n\n          c.  The Plaintiff's  Convenience.  Given the sparseness\n          c.  The Plaintiff's  Convenience.\n                                          \n\nof the record, it is difficult  to say whether trying the case in\n\nMassachusetts would be more  convenient for plaintiff than trying\n\nit in  California.  Certain key witnesses  on the issue of injury\n\nmay be in Massachusetts,  including the reporter.  But  other key\n\nwitnesses may well  be residents  of California.   While we  must\n\naccord plaintiff's  choice  of forum  a  degree of  deference  in\n\nrespect to the issue  of its own convenience, see  Piper Aircraft\n                                                                 \n\nCo.  v. Reyno, 454 U.S.  235, 241 (1981),  the plaintiff's actual\n                                                                 \n\nconvenience seems to be at best a makeweight in this situation.\n\n                                23\n\n          d.   The Administration  of  Justice.   Apart from  the\n          d.

Pertinent Policy Arguments.  One substantive social\n          e.  Pertinent Policy Arguments.\n                                        \n\npolicy that  seems to counsel against  exercising jurisdiction is\n\nthe widely  shared  interest in  preserving citizens' willingness\n\nto  talk openly  with the press.   Forcing  an individual  to fly\n\ncross-country on the strength of one answered telephone call from\n\na journalist likely would  tend to dry up sources  of information\n\nand thereby impede the press in the due performance of its proper\n\nfunction.  Nonetheless,  the Court has  shied away from  allowing\n\nFirst  Amendments  concerns  to  enter  into  the  jurisdictional\n\nanalysis.  See Keeton, 465 U.S. at 780 n.12; Calder v. Jones, 465\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 783, 790 (1984).   Although it might be  argued convincingly\n\nthat  the  jurisdictional  calculus  ought  to  produce  somewhat\n\ndifferent results in defamation actions filed  against reporters'\n\nsources than in actions filed against the journalists responsible\n\nfor  republication of a source's remark, as in Calder, or against\n                                                     \n\nthe media corporation itself, as in Keeton, these precedents give\n                                          \n\nus  pause.  Consequently, we  place no weight  on First Amendment\n\nvalues for purposes of this appeal.\n\n          4.  Tallying the  Results.  We begin the final phase of\n          4.  Tallying the  Results.\n                                   \n\nour  analysis by retracing our steps.   At the first stage of the\n\ndue  process inquiry,  appellant  succeeded in  showing that  its\n\n                                24\n\nputative cause  of action arose from, or  related to, defendant's\n\ncontacts with the forum.  See supra Part II(B)(1).  At the second\n                                   \n\nstage of the inquiry,  appellant succeeded in showing defendant's\n\npurposeful  availment.   See  supra  Part II(B)(2).    On neither\n                                   \n\nprong,  however,  did  appellant  demonstrate more  than  a  bare\n\nminimum;  we found  its  claim of  relatedness  enfeebled by  the\n\nattenuated causal link between the allegedly defamatory utterance\n\nand  the harm allegedly suffered, and its claim of purposefulness\n\nenfeebled  by the fact that the defendant did not initiate either\n\nthe telephone call or the resultant interview.\n\n          The frailty  of appellant's  showings on the  first two\n\nfurcula  of the due process  inquiry required us  to consider the\n\ngestalt factors and  assess the reasonableness of an assertion of\n\njurisdiction  by a Massachusetts court.  Doing so, see supra Part\n                                                            \n\nII(C),  we found that, while many of those factors possess little\n\nsignificance for purposes of this case, there is one factor   the\n\ndefendant's convenience   that stands out from the crowd.   It is\n\nthis factor that consistently has  been declared deserving of the\n\ngreatest weight in kindred cases.  And it is this factor that may\n\nserve as an amulet to ward off vexatiousness and harassment.   We\n\nnow conclude, considering the totality of the circumstances, that\n\ndefendant's burden of  appearance is so  onerous that it  renders\n\nthe  exercise of  in  personam jurisdiction  unreasonable.   This\n                              \n\nconclusion   carries   the  day.      A   distant  court   cannot\n\nconstitutionally  exercise in personam  jurisdiction over  a non-\n                                      \n\nresident  defendant at the behest  of a plaintiff  who can muster\n\n                                25\n\nonly the most tenuous  showings of relatedness and purposefulness\n\nif, as in this case, forcing the defendant to defend in the forum\n\nwould be plainly unreasonable.\n\n          This is as it  should be, for, at bottom,  the dictates\n\nof due process  demand that  a court's assertion  of in  personam\n                                                                 \n\njurisdiction   comport  with  considerations  of  fair  play  and\n\nsubstantial justice.  See, e.g., International  Shoe, 326 U.S. at\n                                                    \n\n320.   To  ensure  achievement of  this  goal, the  machinery  of\n\njurisdictional analysis is designed  to refine judges' intuitions\n\nabout the relevant equities, not to eliminate those equities from\n\nthe decisional process.  Relatedness and purposeful availment are\n\ncogs in  this analytic machinery.   The gestalt  factors comprise\n\nthe  machinery's fail-safe device; they  are not a necessary part\n\nof the machinery's day-to-day operation, but if, in the course of\n\na particularized  analysis, the gears mesh  imperfectly because a\n\ngiven  set of facts does not fit  into any of the standard molds,\n\nthe gestalt factors take hold.  \n\n          This case exemplifies the proper operation of the fail-\n\nsafe  device.  It hardly seems fair,  on the strength of a single\n\nremark uttered  in the course  of a single  unsolicited telephone\n\ncall  from   a  Massachusetts-based   journalist,  to  compel   a\n\nCalifornia resident to defend  a tort suit in a court  3000 miles\n\naway.   The unfairness is heightened because the link between the\n\nremark and the injury has been attenuated by republication in the\n\npopular  press.   Our  commitment  to fair  play  and substantial\n\njustice  precludes us from subjecting  a person to  the rigors of\n\n                                26\n\nlong-distance litigation on the basis of so gossamer a showing of\n\ncausation and voluntariness.\n\n          We  need go no  further.   When all  is said  and done,\n\ncourts must assert jurisdiction, or abjure its assertion, with an\n\neye  toward  fundamental  fairness.   Thus,  here,  the  district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the  instant action for want of  in personam\n                                                                 \n\njurisdiction must be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                27\n",

Alioto  is  an attorney\n\npracticing  in California.    Among his  other  cases, Alioto  is\n\npressing  a  class  action   in  the  California  courts  against\n\nTicketmaster-Southern  California,   Inc.   (T-SC).     T-SC,   a\n\n                                2\n\nCalifornia-based corporation, is affiliated with Ticketmaster-New\n\nYork,  Inc. (T-NY),  a Delaware  corporation.   Both Ticketmaster\n\nentities  are  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling ducats  to\n\nentertainment events.\n\n          The  litigation  between  T-NY  and  Alioto  finds  its\n\ngenesis in the decision  by the Boston Globe, a  daily newspaper,\n                                            \n\nto  undertake   an  investigation   into  pricing  practices   on\n\n\"Ticketmaster's\"  part.1   In  conducting  this investigation,  a\n\nGlobe reporter conversed by telephone with Alioto.  The plaintiff\n     \n\ndoes not allege,  and the  record does not  suggest, that  Alioto\n\ndialed the telephone or otherwise initiated the call.  The record\n\nis equally  barren  of  any  showing that  Alioto  solicited  the\n\ninquiry2  or that  more than  one call  occurred.   It  is clear,\n\nnevertheless,  that  Alioto, who  was  in  California, knew  when\n\nspeaking  that  his  comments would  inform  a  story  slated for\n\npublication in a newspaper circulated chiefly in Massachusetts.\n\n          The investigation  culminated  in a  front-page  expose\n\nthat  hit the newsstands on Sunday, September 20, 1992, under the\n\nbanner headline,  \"Rising ticket fees pad concert  profits.\"  The\n\nensuing article contained  over fifty paragraphs.   Well past the\n\nmidpoint, the article mentioned  mounting complaints about  price\n\n                    \n\n     1The article that capped this investigation makes no attempt\nto distinguish among corporate entities (although it contains one\nvague  reference to  \"Ticketmaster and its  affiliates\").   At no\npoint does the article refer by name to either T-NY or T-SC.\n\n     2Although there is  a passing  allusion in the  record to  a\npress  release issued by Alioto regarding  the lawsuit against T-\nSC,  there is  no indication  that he  forwarded this  release to\nMassachusetts or that it sparked the Globe's story.\n                                          \n\n                                3\n\ngouging in New York and California.  It then reported that \"three\n\nclass action antitrust lawsuits\" had recently been filed \"against\n\nTicketmaster\" in California.  There followed the paragraph around\n\nwhich this controversy revolves  (buried deep in the body  of the\n\narticle).   We quote  the allegedly offending  paragraph in full,\n\nand,  in the  interests  of context,  add  the beginning  of  the\n\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n               Attorney Joseph M. Alioto, who filed one\n          of the suits, charged that kickbacks are  the\n          key  to  Ticketmaster's California  monopoly.\n          \"They're nothing more than a straight bribe,\"\n          he said.\n               Ticketmaster and its affiliates  took on\n          their   California  adversaries   in  typical\n          aggressive fashion, . . .\n\n          Based  on  this  reported comment,  T-NY  brought  suit\n\nagainst  Alioto  in the  United  States  District Court  for  the\n\nDistrict  of Massachusetts.   Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28\n\nU.S.C.    1332 (1988), it alleged that Alioto, with the requisite\n\nintent, conveyed and/or caused  to be conveyed certain defamatory\n\nimpressions of and  concerning T-NY, namely, that T-NY engaged in\n\nbribery and related criminal conduct.\n\n          In due season, Alioto moved to dismiss.  T-NY objected.\n\nThe district judge heard  oral argument and dismissed  the action\n\nfor lack  of in personam jurisdiction,  concluding that appellant\n                        \n\nfailed  to make  the  requisite showing  at  every stage  of  the\n\nobligatory jurisdictional inquiry  under the due  process clause.\n\nSee United Electrical Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089 (1st Cir. 1992) (Pleasant St. I) (discussing nature of\n                                          \n\nrequisite inquiry).

But  here, as we explain below, the  state-law issues are\n\nextremely  murky.  Thus, on  balance, we agree  with the district\n\ncourt that it makes sense to  resolve the jurisdictional question\n\non constitutional grounds.\n\n          In the  first place,  although logic suggests  that, on\n\nthese facts, the defendant  cannot be said to have  performed \"an\n\nact\" in  Massachusetts, that suggestion is  not easily reconciled\n\nwith  Murphy.   There, we  ruled that  an allegedly  tortious act\n            \n\ncommitted  outside the  borders  of  Massachusetts,  purposefully\n\ndirected at the state  and intended to cause injury  there, could\n\nconstitute an  in-forum act within  the meaning of  section 3(c).\n\nSee Murphy, 460  F.2d at 664.  While Murphy  can be distinguished\n                                           \n\non the  ground that it  was decided in the  context of fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, as opposed  to defamation,4 its interpretation\n\nof section  3(c) is worded  in general  terms and its  reasoning \n\nconceivably could  be  transferred  to  the  defamation  context.\n\nDespite  our  profound  reservations about  extending  the Murphy\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     4Appellant argues  that we  have already extended  Murphy to\n                                                              \nthe  defamation arena  in Hugel v.

That case  turned on  a\nconstruction  of the  New Hampshire  long-arm statute,  N.H. Rev.\nStat.  Ann.   510:4 (1993), and the New Hampshire statute, unlike\nits Massachusetts  counterpart, does  not embody the  language of\nthe Uniform Act.\n\n                                7\n\nrationale,5 it spreads  a shadow of  uncertainty over the  state-\n\nlaw issues.\n\n          In  the second  place,  because we  are skeptical  that\n\ndefendant made  any remark  \"of and  concerning\" T-NY, we  harbor\n\ndoubts  whether  defendant  can  be said  to  have  inflicted any\n\n\"tortious injury\" within the  meaning of section 3(c).6   We are,\n\nhowever, hesitant to move beyond an expression of skepticism.  At\n\nthis  stage of the proceedings, appellant has not had the benefit\n\nof  an  evidentiary hearing  or  a  comparable opportunity  (say,\n\naccess  to  the  full-dress  summary judgment  protocol  after  a\n\nreasonable period of  discovery) for presenting proof.   Thus, it\n\nmay be too early to reach the state-law issues.\n\n          To be sure, our reservations about one or both of these\n\n                    \n\n     5Intuitively, it would seem hard to characterize the act  of\npublishing an allegedly defamatory remark outside the forum state\nas an act  within the forum state.   In fact, no  fewer than five\ncourts applying long-arm statutes patterned after the Uniform Act\nhave eschewed  Murphy's reasoning  in the defamation  context and\n                     \ndeclined to assert  jurisdiction on  this basis.

Second,  it ensures that the element\n\nof  causation  remains  in  the  forefront  of  the  due  process\n\ninvestigation.

This case  illustrates  the  point.   The\n\noriginal  comment, technically  a  tort in  its   own  right  (if\n\ndefamatory),  inflicted no significant  injury, except insofar as\n\nit  led to republication in  the ensuing newspaper  article   and\n\nthe form  and tone of the republication was not by any stretch of\n\nthe  most  active  imagination within  the  defendant's effective\n\ncontrol.\n\n          2.

We hold,\n\ntherefore,  that  the  Due  Process  Clause  bars  a  court  from\n\nasserting jurisdiction over the person of a defendant if doing so\n\n                                19\n\nwould be fundamentally unfair.  In this context, gauging fairness\n\nrequires  an   assessment  of  reasonableness  for,   in  certain\n\ncircumstances, unreasonableness can  trump a minimally sufficient\n\nshowing of  relatedness and purposefulness.   We think, moreover,\n\nthat the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a\n\nsliding scale:  the  weaker the plaintiff's showing on  the first\n\ntwo  prongs (relatedness  and purposeful  availment), the  less a\n\ndefendant  need  show  in  terms of  unreasonableness  to  defeat\n\njurisdiction.  The reverse is equally true:  an especially strong\n\nshowing  of  reasonableness may  serve  to  fortify a  borderline\n\nshowing of  relatedness and  purposefulness.  See  Donatelli, 893\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 465.

The Burden  of Appearance.\n                                        \n\nwith forcing a California  resident to appear in a  Massachusetts\n\ncourt  is  onerous  in  terms  of  distance,  and  there  are  no\n\nmitigating  factors to  cushion that  burdensomeness here.   This\n\nburden, and its inevitable concomitant, great  inconvenience, are\n\nentitled to substantial weight in calibrating the  jurisdictional\n\nscales.   Indeed, the Court  has stated that  this element, alone\n\n                    \n\n     13The approach  that we endorse today  differs slightly from\nthat of the Ninth Circuit, which has crafted its own version of a\nsliding scale approach.   The Ninth Circuit's  methodology, as we\nunderstand it,  incorporates the  element of  purposefulness into\nthe  third  prong  of the  inquiry,  and  weighs  it against  the\nremaining considerations of reasonableness.

Compare  National Ass'n  of  Real  Estate\n                                                                 \n\nAppraisers, 1989  U.S. Dist.

It is\n\nthe rare libel case in which both the newspaper and the reporter,\n\nthough amenable to process, are relegated to the sidelines at the\n\nbehest  of an avowedly defamed  plaintiff.  It  is rarer still to\n\ndiscover that such a plaintiff has intentionally selected a forum\n\nin which  punitive damages are unavailable,  bypassing other fora\n\nin which such damages might be awarded.\n\n          Such considerations are important.  One reason that the\n\nfactor of  inconvenience to the  defendant weighs heavily  in the\n\njurisdictional balance  is that  it provides a  mechanism through\n\nwhich  courts may guard against harassment.  It is firmly settled\n\nthat  a \"plaintiff may not,  by choice of  an inconvenient forum,\n\n`vex,' `harass,'  or `oppress'  the defendant by  inflicting upon\n\nhim expense or trouble not  necessary to his own right to  pursue\n\nhis remedy.\"  Gulf Oil Corp. v.

Though we deem  it\n              \n\ninappropriate  to   correlate   the  strength   or  weakness   of\n\nappellant's case on the  merits with the strength or  weakness of\n\n                                22\n\nthe forum state's interest  in this regard,  we think it is  both\n\nappropriate  and  useful  to  note  two  special  considerations.\n\nFirst, the  Commonwealth's interest in the  litigation sub judice\n                                                                 \n\nis  arguably   lessened   by  the   doubts  surrounding   whether\n\ndefendant's act can be said to  have been committed in the forum,\n\nsee supra  p.  7.    Second, if  appellant  in  fact  filed  suit\n         \n\nprimarily to  retaliate against  Alioto's role in  the California\n\nlitigation rather than  to right  an independent wrong    and  as\n\npreviously  mentioned there  are some  clues in  the record  that\n\ncould lead  to such  a  deduction    the Commonwealth's  interest\n\nwould be much diminished.   Cf., e.g., Asahi, 480 U.S.  at 114-15\n                                            \n\n(minimizing  forum state's  interest  in protecting  its citizens\n\nfrom  tortious  injury because  a  dispute  was \"primarily  about\n\nindemnification rather than safety standards\").  Mindful of these\n\nspecial considerations, we conclude  that the forum has a  milder\n\nthan usual interest in the further prosecution of T-NY's suit.\n\n          c.  The Plaintiff's  Convenience.  Given the sparseness\n          c.  The Plaintiff's  Convenience.\n                                          \n\nof the record, it is difficult  to say whether trying the case in\n\nMassachusetts would be more  convenient for plaintiff than trying\n\nit in  California.  Certain key witnesses  on the issue of injury\n\nmay be in Massachusetts,  including the reporter.  But  other key\n\nwitnesses may well  be residents  of California.   While we  must\n\naccord plaintiff's  choice  of forum  a  degree of  deference  in\n\nrespect to the issue  of its own convenience, see  Piper Aircraft\n                                                                 \n\nCo.  v.

Pertinent Policy Arguments.\n                                        \n\npolicy that  seems to counsel against  exercising jurisdiction is\n\nthe widely  shared  interest in  preserving citizens' willingness\n\nto  talk openly  with the press.   Forcing  an individual  to fly\n\ncross-country on the strength of one answered telephone call from\n\na journalist likely would  tend to dry up sources  of information\n\nand thereby impede the press in the due performance of its proper\n\nfunction.  Nonetheless,  the Court has  shied away from  allowing\n\nFirst  Amendments  concerns  to  enter  into  the  jurisdictional\n\nanalysis.  See Keeton, 465 U.S. at 780 n.12; Calder v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111117\"><a href=\"/opinion/111117/calder-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (1984).   Although it might be  argued convincingly\n\nthat  the  jurisdictional  calculus  ought  to  produce  somewhat\n\ndifferent results in defamation actions filed  against reporters'\n\nsources than in actions filed against the journalists responsible\n\nfor  republication of a source's remark, as in Calder, or against\n                                                     \n\nthe media corporation itself, as in Keeton, these precedents give\n                                          \n\nus  pause.  Consequently, we  place no weight  on First Amendment\n\nvalues for purposes of this appeal.\n\n          4.  Tallying the  Results.  We begin the final phase of\n          4.  Tallying the  Results.\n                                   \n\nour  analysis by retracing our steps.   At the first stage of the\n\ndue  process inquiry,  appellant  succeeded in  showing that  its\n\n                                24\n\nputative cause  of action arose from, or  related to, defendant's\n\ncontacts with the forum.  See supra Part II(B)(1).  At the second\n                                   \n\nstage of the inquiry,  appellant succeeded in showing defendant's\n\npurposeful  availment.   See  supra  Part II(B)(2).    On neither\n                                   \n\nprong,  however,  did  appellant  demonstrate more  than  a  bare\n\nminimum;  we found  its  claim of  relatedness  enfeebled by  the\n\nattenuated causal link between the allegedly defamatory utterance\n\nand  the harm allegedly suffered, and its claim of purposefulness\n\nenfeebled  by the fact that the defendant did not initiate either\n\nthe telephone call or the resultant interview.\n\n          The frailty  of appellant's  showings on the  first two\n\nfurcula  of the due process  inquiry required us  to consider the\n\ngestalt factors and  assess the reasonableness of an assertion of\n\njurisdiction  by a Massachusetts court.  Doing so, see supra Part\n                                                            \n\nII(C),  we found that, while many of those factors possess little\n\nsignificance for purposes of this case, there is one factor   the\n\ndefendant's convenience   that stands out from the crowd.   It is\n\nthis factor that consistently has  been declared deserving of the\n\ngreatest weight in kindred cases.  And it is this factor that may\n\nserve as an amulet to ward off vexatiousness and harassment.   We\n\nnow conclude, considering the totality of the circumstances, that\n\ndefendant's burden of  appearance is so  onerous that it  renders\n\nthe  exercise of  in  personam jurisdiction  unreasonable.   This\n                              \n\nconclusion   carries   the  day.      A   distant  court   cannot\n\nconstitutionally  exercise in personam  jurisdiction over  a non-\n                                      \n\nresident  defendant at the behest  of a plaintiff  who can muster\n\n                                25\n\nonly the most tenuous  showings of relatedness and purposefulness\n\nif, as in this case, forcing the defendant to defend in the forum\n\nwould be plainly unreasonable.\n\n          This is as it  should be, for, at bottom,  the dictates\n\nof due process  demand that  a court's assertion  of in  personam\n                                                                 \n\njurisdiction   comport  with  considerations  of  fair  play  and\n\nsubstantial justice.  See, e.g., International  Shoe, 326 U.S. at\n                                                    \n\n320.   To  ensure  achievement of  this  goal, the  machinery  of\n\njurisdictional analysis is designed  to refine judges' intuitions\n\nabout the relevant equities, not to eliminate those equities from\n\nthe decisional process.  Relatedness and purposeful availment are\n\ncogs in  this analytic machinery.   The gestalt  factors comprise\n\nthe  machinery's fail-safe device; they  are not a necessary part\n\nof the machinery's day-to-day operation, but if, in the course of\n\na particularized  analysis, the gears mesh  imperfectly because a\n\ngiven  set of facts does not fit  into any of the standard molds,\n\nthe gestalt factors take hold.  \n\n          This case exemplifies the proper operation of the fail-\n\nsafe  device.  It hardly seems fair,  on the strength of a single\n\nremark uttered  in the course  of a single  unsolicited telephone\n\ncall  from   a  Massachusetts-based   journalist,  to  compel   a\n\nCalifornia resident to defend  a tort suit in a court  3000 miles\n\naway.   The unfairness is heightened because the link between the\n\nremark and the injury has been attenuated by republication in the\n\npopular  press.   Our  commitment  to fair  play  and substantial\n\njustice  precludes us from subjecting  a person to  the rigors of\n\n                                26\n\nlong-distance litigation on the basis of so gossamer a showing of\n\ncausation and voluntariness.\n\n          We  need go no  further.   When all  is said  and done,\n\ncourts must assert jurisdiction, or abjure its assertion, with an\n\neye  toward  fundamental  fairness.   Thus,  here,  the  district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the  instant action for want of  in personam\n                                                                 \n\njurisdiction must be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                27\n</pre>",
