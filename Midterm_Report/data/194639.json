LHP appeals the district court order awarding Rey damages\n\nand future royalties on  certain other \"Curious George\" products.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          \"Curious George\" is  an imaginary  monkey whose  antics\n\nare chronicled in seven  books, written by Margret and  H.A. Rey,\n\nwhich have  entertained readers since  the 1940s.   A mischievous\n\npersonality  consistently lands Curious George in amusing scrapes\n\nand  predicaments.  The more  recent \"monkey business\"    leading\n\nto  the  present litigation     began  in  1977 when  Margret Rey\n\ngranted Milktrain  Productions an option to  produce and televise\n\n104 animated \"Curious George\"  film episodes.  The  option agree-\n\nment was  contingent on  Milktrain's obtaining financing  for the\n\nfilm project,  and adverted to  a potential agreement  to license\n                                           \n\n\"ancillary  products,\" based  on the \"Curious  George\" character,\n\nonce the 104 film episodes had been completed.\n\n                                3\n\nA.  The Original Film Agreements.\n                                \n\n          Milktrain  approached LHP, a  Canadian investment firm,\n\nto  obtain financing for  the project.   LHP  agreed to  fund the\n\nventure by selling  shares in the project to investors (hereinaf-\n\nter:  the \"Milktrain  Agreement\"); LHP and its investors  were to\n\ndivide a 50% share of Milktrain's profits on the films and on any\n\nfuture ancillary products.\n\n          With  the financing  commitment in  place, Rey  granted\n\nMilktrain  and LHP a limited  license \"to produce  (within a two-\n\nyear period from the date of exercise) one hundred and four (104)\n\nfour minute film episodes based on the [\"Curious George\"] charac-\n\nter  solely for broadcast on television\"  (hereinafter:  the \"Rey\n\nLicense\").   Rey  was to  receive a  fee for  assisting  with the\n\nediting and production of the episodes, and an additional royalty\n\namounting  to 10% of the  revenues from any  film telecasts.  The\n\nRey  License made no mention of ancillary product rights.  Never-\n\ntheless, LHP promoted the project to investors through a prospec-\n\ntus (hereinafter:  the \"1978 Private Placement Memorandum\") which\n\nrepresented, inter alia, that \"the production contract [with Rey]\n                       \n\ngives LHP the right to participate in the financing of  . . . the\n\noption . . .  to undertake the  exploitation of  other rights  to\n\n'Curious  George'  including manufacturing,  food,  licensing and\n\nother commercial areas of exploitation.\"\n\nB.  The Revised Agreements.\n                          \n\n          The film project soon  encountered delays and financial\n\nsetbacks.  By early 1979, though only 32 of the  104 episodes had\n\n                                4\n\nbeen completed, the original  investment funds had been virtually\n\nexhausted.  In order to rescue the project and complete the films\n\nto Rey's satisfaction, LHP  offered to arrange additional financ-\n\ning.  In consideration, LHP insisted that the Milktrain Agreement\n\nbe revised to permit LHP to assume control of the film production\n\nprocess  and to  receive higher  royalties on the  completed epi-\n\nsodes.  Milktrain  assented to these  revisions, and the  revised\n\nMilktrain Agreement (hereinafter:   the \"Revised Milktrain Agree-\n\nment\" or \"RMA\") was signed on November 5, 1979.\n\n          As prelude  to its  description of the  new obligations\n\nbetween Milktrain and LHP, the RMA recited that Milktrain and LHP\n\nowned \"the rights to Curious George which have been obtained from\n\n. . . Rey\" under the Rey License.  The RMA further stated that:\n\n          Investors  acquiring  the episodes  shall ac-\n          quire all right,  title and interest therein,\n          without limitation or reserve,  including the\n          original negative . . . .\n\n          LHP shall have the right to participate on an\n          equal basis with  [Milktrain] in their  right\n          of  first refusal  after  the present  agency\n          rights expire to  undertake the  exploitation\n          of  other rights to Curious George, including\n          manufacturing, food, licensing and the publi-\n          cation of the 104 episodes in book form . . .\n          in  accordance with  the  rights  granted  to\n          [Milktrain] and  LHP [by Rey] in [the Revised\n          Rey License].1\n\n          Simultaneously  with the  negotiation of  the RMA,  LHP\n\nproposed several  changes in the Rey  License, including language\n\n                    \n\n     1Shortly thereafter, Milktrain apparently assigned its share\nof ancillary  product licensing  rights to LHP,  leaving LHP  the\nsole owner of these rights.\n\n                                5\n\nwhich would have  granted LHP the  immediate right to  \"undertake\n\nthe exploitation  of other rights to  'Curious George,' including\n\nmanufacturing,  food, licensing  and the  publication of  the 104\n\nepisodes in  book form.\"   Rey  rejected  the LHP  proposal in  a\n\nletter to Richard G.  D. Lafferty (president and C.E.O.  of LHP):\n\n\"I have repeatedly stated to Milktrain and to you that I will not\n\nconsider negotiating such rights before the films are done.\"  Rey\n\ndid  consent, however, to certain changes to the royalty arrange-\n\nments, whereby Rey  would receive  a 10% share  of film  revenues\n\nonly \"after  the investors  have recouped [their  investment] and\n\ncertain soft dollar commitments . . . have been paid.\"\n\n          On November 5, 1979, concurrently with the execution of\n\nthe Revised  Milktrain Agreement,  a revised  version of the  Rey\n\nLicense  (hereinafter:  the  \"Revised Rey License\"  or \"RRL\") was\n\nexecuted,  incorporating  these   changes,  and  superseding  the\n\noriginal  Rey License.   The  RRL recited  that the  original Rey\n\nLicense  had granted Milktrain and  LHP the right  to produce and\n\ndistribute animated \"Curious George\" films \"for  television view-\n\ning,\"  but  made no  mention  of the  \"ancillary  product\" rights\n\nunsuccessfully sought by LHP.\n\n          As agreed, LHP undertook  to arrange further  financing\n\nto complete the film project.  On November 23, 1979, LHP released\n\nanother  prospectus (hereinafter:   the  \"1979 Private  Placement\n\nMemorandum\") to  which it  attached the Revised  Milktrain Agree-\n\nment.  The 1979  Private Placement Memorandum again  stressed the\n\nprospect of  eventual revenues from ancillary  products but noted\n\n                                6\n\nthat these rights \"have yet to be negotiated\" with Rey.\n\nC.   The Ancillary Products Agreement.\n                                     \n\n          Production  of the  104  TV episodes  was completed  in\n\n1982.   On January 3, 1983,  an Ancillary Products  Agreement (or\n\n\"APA\") was signed by Rey and LHP, granting LHP a general right to\n\nlicense \"Curious George\" in spin-off (\"ancillary\") products for a\n\nrenewable term of five  years.  The APA defined  \"ancillary prod-\n\nucts\" as:\n\n          All  tangible  goods  . . . excluding  books,\n          films, tapes, records,  or video  productions\n          . . . . However, for stories already owned by\n          [LHP]  and which  have been  produced as  104\n          episodes  under the  license  granted in  the\n          January, 1978 agreement  and the  November 5,\n          1979  revision of that agreement, [LHP] shall\n          have  the  right  to  produce  books,  films,\n          tapes, records and video productions of these\n          episodes  under  this  Agreement, subject  to\n          [Rey's]  prior  approval  . . .  which  prior\n          approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nIn  return for these rights, Rey  was to receive one-third of the\n\nroyalties on  the licensed products, with  certain minimum annual\n\npayments guaranteed.   Rey retained the  right to disapprove  any\n                                                                 \n\nproduct, and  to propose changes  which would make  a disapproved\n       \n\nproduct  acceptable to her.   The APA provided,  inter alia, that\n                                                           \n\nRey's approval would not be withheld \"unreasonably.\"\n\nD.  The Houghton Mifflin Contract.\n                                 \n\n          Following  the  execution  of  the  Ancillary  Products\n\nAgreement, LHP assigned its licensing rights to a new subsidiary,\n\nCurgeo Enterprises,  which turned its attention  to licensing the\n\n                                7\n\n\"Curious  George\"  character  in  various  product  forms.2    On\n\nMarch 27, 1984, Curgeo executed  a contract with Houghton Mifflin\n\nCompany to publish the  104 television film episodes in  the form\n\nof a children's book series.  The contract provided that Houghton\n\nMifflin  would publish  at least  four books,  with illustrations\n\ndrawn  directly from the film  negatives, in each  year from 1984\n\nthrough 1987; the contract was renewable  for an additional five-\n\nyear term  if LHP and Rey  agreed to extend the  APA beyond 1987.\n\nPursuant to  the contract, Houghton Mifflin  published four books\n\neach year from 1984 through 1987.\n\n          In  1987, LHP  notified  Houghton Mifflin  that it  had\n\ndeclined to extend  the APA, but that Curgeo  had \"entered into a\n\nnew  operating agreement which permits  us to continue  to act in\n\nthe capacity  in  which we  have been  acting for  the last  five\n\nyears. . . . [Y]ou are free to pick up your option to renew.\"  In\n\nresponse, Houghton  Mifflin extended  its contract for  the addi-\n\ntional  five-year term,  publishing an  additional four  books in\n\n1988 and again in 1989.  It ceased publication of the book series\n\nin 1990, when Rey advised that the APA had been cancelled.\n\nE.   Other Product Licenses.\n                           \n\n          Curgeo  moved  aggressively  to  license  the  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" character in other  product areas as well.   Beginning in\n\n1983, the  \"Curious George\"  TV  episodes were  licensed to  Sony\n\n                    \n\n     2Curgeo  Enterprises  is not  named  in  the Rey  complaint;\nCurgeo  Agencies Inc.  and  Curgeo Overseas,  Inc., are  named as\ndefendants.   We  refer to  the  three entities  collectively  as\n\"Curgeo.\"\n\n                                8\n\nCorporation,  which transferred  the images  from the  television\n\nfilm negatives to  videotape.   LHP takes the  position that  the\n\nSony video license was entered pursuant to the RRL; Rey claims it\n\nis subject to the APA.  See supra at pp. 6-7.\n                                 \n\n          In 1983, Curgeo licensed  \"Curious George\" to Eden Toys\n\nInc., which proposed to market a \"Curious George\" plush  toy.  In\n\nthe beginning, Rey rejected Eden's proposed  designs for the toy,\n\nbut Eden eventually proposed  several versions which were accept-\n\nable to Rey.   The plush toy was marketed from  1983 to 1990, but\n\nexperienced poor sales and  generated less revenue than expected.\n\nEden blamed the  poor market performance on  Rey's alterations to\n\nEden's original design proposals.\n\n          In 1987,  Curgeo  received  a  commitment  from  Sears,\n\nRoebuck  to market  \"Curious  George\" pajamas  through the  Sears\n\ncatalog.   The  Sears pajama  project promised high  returns, but\n\ncatalog deadlines  necessitated immediate  approval of  a product\n\ndesign.   Glen Konkle,  Curgeo's agent, brought  Rey a  prototype\n\npajama and a flat paper sketch of \"Curious George\" which had been\n\nproposed as  the basis for the  final pattern.  Rey  rejected the\n\nproposal, complaining  that the  pajama material was  \"hard, ugly\n\n[and] bright yellow,\" and that the sketch of \"Curious George\" was\n\n\"plump\" and \"not  recognizable.\"  The catalog deadline passed and\n\nthe pajama manufacturers withdrew their bids.  In addition, Beach\n\nPaper  Products,  which had  orally  agreed  to license  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" for a line  of paper novelties, withdrew its  offer after\n\nlearning that  \"Curious George\" products would  not receive expo-\n\n                                9\n\nsure in the Sears catalog.\n\n          In 1988, Curgeo licensed  \"Curious George\" to DLM Inc.,\n\nwhich intended to use the \"Curious George\" character in a trilogy\n\nof educational software.  Rey approved the software in principle,\n\nand production began in July 1988.   In August 1988, however, DLM\n\nwithdrew its plans to complete the \"trilogy\" after Rey telephoned\n\nDLM's project director and  harshly criticized the design  of the\n\nfirst software  product and the accompanying  manual developed by\n\nDLM.\n\nF.  The Ancillary Products Agreement Renewal.\n                                            \n\n          Due  in part  to these  product rejections,  LHP earned\n\nless money than it anticipated from ancillary products.  When the\n\nAPA came up for renewal in January 1988, LHP declined to exercise\n\nits  option for  an  additional  five-year  term.   Instead,  the\n\nparties agreed to renew on  a month-to-month basis, terminable by\n\neither  party  on one  month's notice.    Rey's royalty  rate was\n\nincreased to 50% (effective January 3, 1988), but with no guaran-\n\nteed minimum payment.  On April 10, 1989, Rey terminated the APA.\n\nLHP responded by advising that Curgeo would \"continue to adminis-\n\nter those licenses which [remained] outstanding and report to you\n\nfrom time  to  time accordingly.\"    LHP thereupon  continued  to\n\nmarket the Sony  videos and  to publish the  television films  in\n\nbook form under the Houghton Mifflin agreements.\n\nG.   \"Curious George\" Goes to Court.\n                                   \n\n          On February 8,  1991, Rey filed  suit against Lafferty,\n\n                                10\n\nCurgeo and  LHP, in  connection with LHP's  continuing, allegedly\n\nunauthorized production  of the  Houghton Mifflin books  and Sony\n\nvideos.  Rey's complaint alleged violations of federal copyright,\n\ntrademark  and unfair-competition  statutes, breach  of contract,\n\nand  violations  of Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A (\"chapter  93A\"); it\n\nsought to  enjoin further violations and to recover unpaid royal-\n\nties on the books and videos.  LHP countersued, claiming that Rey\n\nunreasonably had withheld approval  of various products while the\n\nAPA  remained  in force.   The  LHP  complaint alleged  breach of\n\ncontract, interference with contractual and advantageous business\n\nrelationships, and violation of chapter 93A.\n\n          After a four-day bench  trial, the district court found\n\nfor Rey on  her claims  for breach of  contract, ruling that  the\n\nbook and video licenses were governed by the APA and that Rey was\n\nentitled to recover $256,327  in royalties.  The court  found for\n\nLHP  on  several LHP  counterclaims,  however,  holding that  Rey\n\nunreasonably  had withheld  approval  of, inter  alia, the  Sears\n                                                     \n\npajamas, the DLM software, and  Eden's original plush toy design.\n\nLHP was  awarded $317,000,  representing lost profits  and conse-\n\nquential damages  resulting from  Rey's rejection of  these prod-\n\nucts.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          \"Under  Massachusetts law,  the  'interpretation  of  a\n\ncontract is  ordinarily  a  question  of  law  for  the  court'.\"\n\n                                11\n\nFairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v.

The evidence cut both ways.  On the one hand, the RMA\n\nand  the RRL were executed  at approximately the  same time, with\n\nsome overlap in their internal references and subject matter.  On\n\nthe  other hand, their  respective provisions are  less in unison\n\nthan parallel.5   Most  importantly, the written  and circumstan-\n\ntial indicia sharply  contradict any suggestion  of a meeting  of\n\nthe minds relating to  the licensing of ancillary products.

Finally, the parties' intention to exclude the Hough-\n\nton Mifflin books from the RRL, and their intention to cover them\n\nin  the  APA, are  corroborated  by  their subsequent  course  of\n\ndealing:  among  other things, the record shows that LHP paid Rey\n\nroyalties on the books and videos on several occasions at the 33%\n                                                                 \n\nrate  required under the APA, rather than the 10% rate prescribed\n                            \n\nby the  RRL, and  that Curgeo  expressly keyed  the dates of  the\n\nHoughton Mifflin  contract to  the term (and  anticipated renewal\n                                                                 \n\nterm) of the Ancillary Products Agreement:\n                                         \n\n          By September 30, 1987,  Curgeo [will]  inform\n          [Houghton  Mifflin] in writing  as to whether\n          Curgeo  has exercised  its option  to exploit\n          the   character   \"Curious  George\"   through\n          December 31,  1993 and,  if Curgeo  has exer-\n          cised  said option,  Curgeo  shall  give  the\n          Publisher the option to extend this Agreement\n          through December 31, 1993.\n\n          It was for  the district court to balance  the evidence\n\nin the  first instance, see  Holmes Realty Trust, 517  N.E. 2d at\n                                                \n\n504, and  we discern no sound  reason to disagree  with its find-\n\nings,  particularly  on \"clear  error\"  review.

The RRL contained no grant of rights to produce the Hough-\n\nton  Mifflin  books, and  the APA,  which  granted the  right \"to\n\nproduce books . . . of these episodes,\" obligated LHP  to pay Rey\n\nroyalties on the books without  regard to whether LHP's investors\n\nhad  recouped their  investment on  the television  film project.\n\nThus,  the district  court  did not  err  in finding  that  LHP's\n\nwithholding of the Houghton  Mifflin book royalties was wrongful,\n\nand we affirm its ruling on this point.  \n\n                    \n\n     6We reject  LHP's further  contention that Rey's  failure to\nprotest publication of  the four Houghton  Mifflin books in  1990\nestops her from cancelling the book and video contracts under the\nAPA.   Where more than one inference fairly may be drawn from the\nevidence and  an estoppel ruling  turns on an  issue of fact,  we\nreview for clear error.  United  States v.

In our  view, Rey's conduct\ndoes not require an inference that she acquiesced in the publica-\ntion  of these books  under the APA.   Rather, Rey  protested the\npublication  of the  four  books  by  filing suit  shortly  after\nrealizing the unauthorized nature of Houghton Mifflin's continued\npublication.  The district court apparently found that Rey's one-\nyear delay, dating from  the first unauthorized publication until\nthe filing of Rey's  suit for injunctive relief, was  not \"unrea-\nsonable\"  in the  circumstances, and  we  decline to  disturb its\nfindings on this issue.\n\n                                18\n\n     2.

Television  requires  an\n          intermediary  network,  station, or  cable to\n          send the television  signals into  consumers'\n          homes.   The menu of  entertainment appearing\n          on  television is controlled  entirely by the\n          intermediary and, thus, the consumer's selec-\n          tion is limited to what is available on vari-\n          ous channels.  Moreover, equipped merely with\n          a conventional television set, a consumer has\n          no means of capturing any part of the televi-\n          sion  display; when  the program  is over  it\n          vanishes,  and the  consumer is  powerless to\n          replay  it.   Because they  originate outside\n          the  home,  television signals  are ephemeral\n          and beyond the viewer's grasp.\n\n          Videocassettes, of course, allow viewing of a\n          markedly  different  nature. . . .  By  their\n          very  essence, . . .  videocassettes liberate\n          viewers  from  the constraints  otherwise in-\n          herent in television,  and eliminate the  in-\n          volvement of an intermediary, such  as a net-\n          work.\n\n          Television  and  videocassette  display  thus\n          have very  little in common  besides the fact\n          that a conventional  monitor of a  television\n          set  may be  used both to  receive television\n          signals and to  exhibit a videocassette.   It\n          is in  light of this fact  that Paramount ar-\n          gues that VCRs  are equivalent to \"exhibition\n          by  means of  television.\"    Yet, even  that\n          assertion is flawed.  Playing a videocassette\n          on a VCR does  not require a standard televi-\n          sion  set  capable  of  receiving  television\n          signals by cable or  by broadcast; it is only\n          necessary to have a  monitor capable of  dis-\n          playing the material on the magnetized tape.\n\nId. at 853-54.\n   \n\n          Most  recently,  in  Tele-Pac,  Inc. v.

Although  the RRL  conversely contains  no \"specific\n\nlimiting language,\"  compare Cohen, 845  F.2d at 853,  we believe\n                                  \n\nsuch limitation is reasonably inferable from the situation of the\n\n                                26\n\nparties  and  the \"general  tenor of  the  section\" in  which the\n\n\"television viewing\" rights were granted.\n\n          Second, as properly  noted in Cohen, \"television  view-\n                                             \n\ning\" and \"videocassette viewing\" are not coextensive terms.

Rey,  an elderly woman, does\n\nnot appear  to have  participated in its  drafting, and,  indeed,\n\ndoes  not appear to have  been represented by  counsel during the\n\nlarger part of  the transaction.

The \"Junk Products\" Counterclaim.\n                                    \n\n          We  next turn to the LHP counterclaim that Rey breached\n\nthe APA  by \"wrongfully withholding\" approval  of ancillary prod-\n\nucts  she considered  \"junky.\"9  The  district court  agreed with\n\nLHP, holding that\n\n          [The  Ancillary  Products Agreement]  clearly\n          contemplated  the   exploitation  of  Curious\n          George. . . . Based on  the testimony of  Ms.\n          Stoebenau and  Mr. Konkle, I find  that means\n          that there may  be produced with  the charac-\n          ter,  junk  products,  junky  products. . . .\n          Plaintiff [had]  the right . . . to insist on\n          . . . an  honest  and good  depiction of  the\n                                                       \n          character.

The court further found:  \n\n          [A]lthough  Mrs. Rey  unquestionably approved\n          many  products, I  find  that she  improperly\n          disapproved the Sears project for the reasons\n          just  outlined;   that  she  was unreasonable\n          with  respect to the  Eden project,  and that\n          she was so rude to Ms. Craighead  as to abort\n          the second and perhaps later trilogies of the\n          software.\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   After careful  consideration, we  must agree\n\nwith Rey that the district court misapplied the APA. \n\n          The  product-approval procedure under  the APA required\n\n                    \n\n     9LHP does not  challenge the district court  ruling that its\ncounterclaims  for interference with contractual and advantageous\nbusiness relationships,  breach of  the implied covenant  of good\nfaith  and  fair dealing,  and  unfair  business practices  under\nchapter 93A were time-barred.\n\n                                29\n\nthat:\n\n          LHP  will submit product or other information\n          sufficient to describe the product to you for\n          prior approval.   When a product is submitted\n          . . . we will wait two weeks  before proceed-\n          ing.  If we do not receive any disapproval of\n          the product from you  within two weeks we are\n          entitled to  presume that you approve  of the\n          product.   If you do disapprove  of any prod-\n          uct,  you  will,  if  feasible,  suggest such\n          changes  to  LHP  as may  render  the product\n          acceptable to  you,  or, if  you cannot  make\n          such feasible suggestions, you may  refuse to\n          approve the product.   Product approval  will\n          not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe term \"product\" is not defined in the APA.  It is black letter\n\nlaw, however, that where \"the words of an agreement are plain and\n\nfree from ambiguity, they must be construed in their ordinary and\n\nusual sense,\" Boston Edison Corp. v. FERC, 856 F.2d 361, 365 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1988), and,  as we have  noted in another context,  the word\n\n'product,' taken in  its ordinary and usual  sense, \"simply means\n\n'something produced.'\"   See K  Mart, 892 F.2d  at 1085  (quoting\n                                    \n\nWebster's Third  New International Dictionary 1810  (1981)).

Considered in context,\n\nwe  think  the \"ordinary  and usual\"  meaning  of the  broad term\n\n\"product\" plainly  indicates the  parties' mutual  intention that\n\neach  article bearing  the likeness  of \"Curious  George\"     not\n             \n\n                                30\n\nmerely the likeness itself    be approved by Rey.\n\n          By  contrast, the  narrow interpretation  urged by  LHP\n\nwould  convert the  term \"product\"  into a  mere synonym  for the\n\n\"Curious  George\" mark.  Nowhere  does the APA  intimate that the\n\nparties contemplated that the  term \"product\" was to be  given so\n\nrestrictive an interpretation.  Indeed, elsewhere the APA plainly\n\nprecludes  the narrow  interpretation urged  by LHP  by expressly\n\ndistinguishing between the  mark and the \"product\" with  which it\n              \n\nis used.  See APA p.3 (\"[LHP] will not sell or authorize the sale\n             \n\nor distribution of  any product  on or in  connection with  which\n                                                                 \n\n'Curious George'  is used  . . .\") (emphasis  added); id.  at 3-4\n                                                         \n\n(referring  to separate  approval  procedure for  \"apparel  prod-\n                                                                 \n\nucts\").10  As the  APA is unambiguous in  this regard, the  trial\n    \n\n                    \n\n     10The interpretation we adopt accords with  the common-sense\nunderstanding recognized in other  areas of intellectual property\nlaw.

It falls to  us to define\n\n\"usual standards of reasonableness,\" in the present context, in a\n\nway  which  accords with  the  contracting  parties' intent,  yet\n\navoids  rendering the  \"reasonableness\"  standard  either  purely\n\nillusory or duplicative of more particular contractual terms.\n\n          We  think  the  APA's  proscription  of  \"unreasonable\"\n\nproduct disapproval  required, at a minimum,  that Rey articulate\n\nsome material reason, subjective or otherwise, for disapproving a\n             \n\n                                33\n\nproduct.  That is to say, Rey could not withhold product approval\n\nwithout ascribing  a reason,  nor for  reasons immaterial  to the\n\n\"Curious George\" mark, its  proposed use or commercial potential,\n\nor  unrelated to Rey's  artistic and  reputational identification\n\nwith the mark and ancillary  products.  Moreover, assuming  there\n\nexisted some material ground for withholding product approval, it\n\nwould need to be communicated, consistent with contractual speci-\n\nfications,  \"within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner,\n\ni.e., in  a manner which makes it  possible for [the licensee] to\n    \n\nrework the [product]  in order to meet . . . approval.\"  See Zim,\n                                                                \n\n573  F.2d at 1324.

In the\n                           \n\ncontext  of this case, for example, Rey could not impose approval\n\nstandards  which would  effectively eliminate  all potential  for\n\nprofitable  use of  the \"Curious  George\" property;  the parties'\n\nmutual assent, in the APA, that Rey would be  entitled to minimum\n\nroyalty payments,  plainly  implied a  mutual understanding  that\n\nsome licensing of the \"Curious George\" character would be accept-\n    \n\nable,  in order  to enable  sales from  which royalties  might be\n\ngenerated.

We  turn to  the particular  product rejections\n\nchallenged on appeal.\n\n     1.   The Sears Pajamas.\n                           \n\n          The district court ruled that Rey acted unreasonably by\n\nbasing  her  disapproval of  the  Sears  project on  the  \"junky\"\n\nquality  of the pajama material which  would bear \"Curious Georg-\n\ne's\" likeness.11   As  we have stated,  see supra  at pp.  32-34,\n                                                 \n\nthe basis for the  district court's finding of \"unreasonableness\"\n\nwas  insufficient as a  matter of law.   Rey did not unreasonably\n\nwithhold approval of the Sears pajama  project as unbefitting the\n\n\"Curious George\"  image protected  by her copyright,  because the\n\ngrounds for  withholding approval were reasonably  related to the\n\n                    \n\n     11The district  court did not address  the aesthetic reasons\nRey  gave  for rejecting  the  Sears project,  viz.,  the \"bright\n                                                   \nyellow\"  color  of the  pajama  material  and the  unrecognizable\n\"plump\"  depiction of \"Curious George.\"  We believe these grounds\nwere not unreasonable.\n\n                                35\n\nintegrity  and commercial  value of her  artistic creation.

The Beach Paper Products.\n                                  \n\n          Our  conclusion that Rey  reasonably rejected the Sears\n\nproject disposes of LHP's claim for damages relating to the Beach\n\npaper  products as well.  Rey never saw, much less \"disapproved,\"\n\nthe  Beach  paper products:   as  the undisputed  evidence shows,\n\nBeach  withdrew its proposal when the Sears project fell through;\n\nit never reached agreement  with LHP or presented any  product to\n\nRey for  approval.   Therefore,  LHP's claimed  right to  recover\n\npotential profits from  the Beach project could  be justified, if\n\nat  all, only as consequential damages  resulting from a wrongful\n                                      \n\nrejection of the  Sears project.   As the  Sears project was  not\n\nwrongfully  rejected under  the  terms of  the  APA, LHP  is  not\n\nentitled to consequential damages  related to Beach's anticipated\n\n                    \n\n     12LHP  nonetheless  maintains that  Rey's  rejection of  the\nSears  pajama project was  \"unreasonable,\" insofar as  it was not\ncommunicated  in  a manner  which  \"ma[de] it  possible  . . . to\nrework  the [product] in order  to obtain . . .  approval.\"  Zim,\n                                                                \n573 F.2d at 1324.  LHP argues that time pressures inherent in the\nSears catalog deadlines  made the presentation  of the pajamas  a\n\"one-shot deal,\"  with \"reworking\" of the  design impossible once\nrejection  had occurred.  It insists that the \"lousy material\" in\nthe pajamas    a  basis for Rey's disapproval     was required by\nfederal fire  safety standards;  no other material  was available\nfor use in the product.\n     Even assuming  these fact-based arguments are  well founded,\nhowever     an assessment we  are in no  position to make  on the\npresent record    they are beside the point:  the APA's  \"reason-\nableness\" constraint did not oblige Rey to apply lower standards,\nor  to relax  her vigilance  in policing  ancillary uses  for the\n\"Curious George\" character, merely  because deadlines were  tight\nor objections to the product could not be cured.  See APA at p. 3\n                                                     \n(\"if you  disapprove  of  any  product, you  will,  if  feasible,\n                                                                \nsuggest such changes to  [LHP] as may render the  product accept-\nable to you\") (emphasis added).  \n\n                                36\n\nprofits.

The Eden Plush Toys.\n                             \n\n          The district court  ruled that  Rey acted  unreasonably\n\nwith respect to the  Eden plush toys project,  but the court  did\n\nnot state whether its ruling was based on Rey's objections to the\n\n\"junky\" nature of the proposed product, or some other ground.  We\n\nconclude, nonetheless, that remand  is unnecessary in the present\n\ncircumstances, see Produits Nestle,  982 F.2d at 640-41  (\"when a\n                                  \n\ntrial  court misperceives and  misapplies the law,  remand may or\n\nmay  not be  essential\"), since  LHP did  not present  sufficient\n\nevidence to enable a  finding that Rey's actions with  respect to\n\nEden were \"unreasonable.\"   See id. at 642 (quoting  Dedham Water\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v.

We believe  an author's\n     \n\ndiscretionary right to disapprove an ancillary product, as not in\n\nkeeping  with the  aesthetic image the  author envisions  for her\n\nartistic creation,  reasonably may be  made to depend  on product\n\nconformity, at least where, as here, conformity with the author's\n\naesthetic standard would neither  set unreasonably high levels of\n\ncommercial  practicality nor  foreclose all  prospect  of profit-\n                                                     \n\nability on which the  contract was predicated.  See  supra at pp.\n                                                          \n\n33-34.\n\n          The evidence before  the district court clearly  showed\n\nthat Rey imposed a demanding aesthetic standard for the design of\n\nthe  Eden Toys  doll.13  Eden's  frustration at  Rey's meticulous\n\nimmersion  in the details of toy design may indeed be understand-\n\nable, the more so perhaps because of the irascible terms in which\n\nRey appears to  have chosen  to couch her  product criticisms  on\n\noccasion.  Even viewing the evidence as a whole in the light most\n\n                    \n\n     13For example,  she relocated the felt  patterns on \"Curious\nGeorge's\"  face  by a  few  millimeters  and rejected  particular\ncolors and color  combinations which Eden thought would  make the\ndoll more saleable.\n\n                                38\n\nflattering to LHP, however, we cannot conclude that her  proposed\n\nchanges were unrelated to her  legitimate artistic concerns or to\n\nher desire  to protect the  aesthetic integrity  of the  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" image.\n\n          \"Reasonableness\"  likewise  requires,  of course,  that\n\nchanges be made  \"within a  reasonable time and  in a  reasonable\n\nmanner, i.e., in a manner which makes it possible for [the licen-\n            \n\nsee] to  rework the [product] in  order to meet .  . . approval.\"\n\nSee  Zim, 573  F.2d at 1324.   The  evidence before  the district\n        \n\ncourt, which we  have examined in detail, did not show that Rey's\n\nproduct criticisms, though caustic,  were made in an unreasonable\n\ntime or manner.  And although the record is replete with testimo-\n\nny that  Eden and  LHP grumbled  about Rey's product  criticisms,\n\nneither  Eden  nor LHP  ever communicated  to  Rey, prior  to the\n                                                  \n\npresent  lawsuit, that her proposed changes to the Eden plush toy\n\nproducts were  impracticable or even unduly  burdensome.14  Since\n\nRey's  objections to  Eden's original  toy  design were  based on\n\ncriteria  reasonably  related  to  her  legitimate  artistic  and\n\naesthetic concerns about the proposed ancillary product, and were\n\ncommunicated  in a  time and  manner which  would permit  Eden to\n\nconform  the product, we conclude that  Rey's rejection of Eden's\n\nproduct designs was not \"unreasonable.\"\n\n                    \n\n     14For  example,   the  President  of  Eden  Toys  testified:\n\"[W]hat we tried to do, therefore, was to  get very specific, and\nsay: If you  want it moved  three millimeters to the  left, we'll\n                                                                 \nmove it, but let's all agree on that's where it's going to be . .\n       \n. .\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                39\n\n     4.   The DLM Software.\n                          \n\n          Finally, we consider whether  Rey's alleged rudeness to\n\nDonna Craighead, the DLM project manager, amounted to  an \"unrea-\n\nsonable  withholding of approval\" of  the DLM software project in\n\nviolation of  the APA.   We  conclude that  it did  not.  As  all\n\nparties  agree, the  licensing  arrangement between  DLM and  LHP\n\ncovered only the first  installment in the proposed  DLM software\n\ntrilogy, the first installment  was approved by Rey prior  to her\n                                            \n\ntelephone  conversation  with  Craighead, and  DLM  continued  to\n\nmanufacture and market the first-installment  software even after\n\nRey's intemperate remarks.  Given  the fact that Rey's statements\n\nled to no  curtailment in the production or  sale of the licensed\n\nsoftware,  we are unable to discern any relevant respect in which\n\nRey's statements  to Craighead could be  considered a \"rejection\"\n\nof the product for which LHP had issued its license to DLM.\n\n          The district court apparently  thought that Rey's harsh\n\ncriticism of the first  software installment may have discouraged\n\nDLM from undertaking \"second and . . . later\" installments in the\n\nproposed trilogy.   Here, however, the  relevant consideration is\n\nthat these subsequent  installments had not yet  been licensed by\n                                                              \n\nthe time Rey communicated her criticism about the  first software\n                                                        \n\nproduct  and manual.   Even  were Rey's  criticism  actionable in\n\ntort,  as an  \"intentional  interference  with contractual  rela-\n\ntions,\"  see Restatement (Second) of Torts    766, or as a breach\n            \n\nof the implied good-faith  duty not to interfere with  LHP's per-\n\nformance under  the APA,  it nevertheless was  not actionable  in\n\n                                40\n\ncontract.   Under  the plain  terms  of the  APA,  Rey could  not\n\n\"reject\" products  not yet licensed or  presented for approval.15\n\n          LHP  attempts to  extend  the APA's  plain language  by\n\ncharacterizing Rey's criticism of the DLM project as \"essentially\n\nrevok[ing]  product  approval  [of]  the  DLM  software  concept\"\n                                                                \n\nalready approved  by Rey.  LHP does not define the term \"software\n\nconcept,\" but clearly uses it to encompass not only the first DLM\n\nproduct but  all subsequent installments in  the planned trilogy.\n\nSuch  an interpretation  would not  withstand analysis  under the\n\nlanguage of  the APA,  however, nor  comport with  the undisputed\n\nrecord evidence.\n\n          We reject LHP's  overly expansive definition  of \"prod-\n\nuct\" in the present context.   By lumping all DLM software  prod-\n\nucts under the umbrella of a single software \"concept,\" LHP would\n\neviscerate Rey's retained right to grant, or reasonably withhold,\n\napproval  for  distinct generations  of  software  products in  a\n\nparticular  software series.   All conceptually  related articles\n                                               \n\nidentified by  LHP as  part of  the same  series would  be deemed\n\napproved,  sight unseen;  the policing  of the  integrity of  the\n\nconceptual relationship  presumably having ceased to  be a matter\n\nof legitimate concern  to Rey.  Courts universally recognize that\n\nthe  elasticity of contract  language is  limited by  the natural\n\nmeaning of its terms and their context.  See K Mart, 892 F.2d  at\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n     15The district court ruled that the tort claims  arising out\nof  \"most of\"  Rey's  conduct were  time-barred.   LHP  does  not\nchallenge this ruling.  See supra n.9 and accompanying text.\n                                 \n\n                                41\n\n1085; Boston Edison Corp., 856 F.2d at 365.  LHP's interpretation\n                         \n\nstrips the \"product approval\" term  from its context and depletes\n\nits natural meaning.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Under the APA, Rey is entitled to recover the royalties\n\nwrongly withheld on  the Houghton Mifflin books  and Sony videos;\n\nand we affirm the district court rulings respecting these claims.\n\nThe APA likewise  entitled Rey to  withhold approval of  licensed\n\nancillary  products  on reasonable  grounds;  thus,  LHP was  not\n\nentitled to  recover damages for Rey's reasonable exercise of her\n\nright to withhold approval of the Sears pajama project, the Beach\n\npaper products,  the Eden  Toys project, or  the DLM  software.16\n\nAccordingly, the damages awards to LHP are vacated.\n\n          Affirmed in  part, reversed in part;  costs are awarded\n                                                                 \n\nto Rey.\n      \n\n                    \n\n     16We  have considered  all other  arguments advanced  by the\nparties  and find  them either to  be wanting  or, alternatively,\nmoot.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we note\nthat, because  we conclude that Rey  reasonably withheld approval\nof  the Sears project, the Eden plush toys, and the DLM software,\nwe  need not  consider  whether LHP's  estimates  of lost  future\nprofits from  these products  were sufficiently certain  and non-\nspeculative to support an award of damages.

LHP appeals the district court order awarding Rey damages\n\nand future royalties on  certain other \"Curious George\" products.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          \"Curious George\" is  an imaginary  monkey whose  antics\n\nare chronicled in seven  books, written by Margret and  H.A. Rey,\n\nwhich have  entertained readers since  the 1940s.   A mischievous\n\npersonality  consistently lands Curious George in amusing scrapes\n\nand  predicaments.  The more  recent \"monkey business\"    leading\n\nto  the  present litigation     began  in  1977 when  Margret Rey\n\ngranted Milktrain  Productions an option to  produce and televise\n\n104 animated \"Curious George\"  film episodes.  The  option agree-\n\nment was  contingent on  Milktrain's obtaining financing  for the\n\nfilm project,  and adverted to  a potential agreement  to license\n                                           \n\n\"ancillary  products,\" based  on the \"Curious  George\" character,\n\nonce the 104 film episodes had been completed.\n\n                                3\n\nA.  The Original Film Agreements.\n                                \n\n          Milktrain  approached LHP, a  Canadian investment firm,\n\nto  obtain financing for  the project.   LHP  agreed to  fund the\n\nventure by selling  shares in the project to investors (hereinaf-\n\nter:  the \"Milktrain  Agreement\"); LHP and its investors  were to\n\ndivide a 50% share of Milktrain's profits on the films and on any\n\nfuture ancillary products.\n\n          With  the financing  commitment in  place, Rey  granted\n\nMilktrain  and LHP a limited  license \"to produce  (within a two-\n\nyear period from the date of exercise) one hundred and four (104)\n\nfour minute film episodes based on the [\"Curious George\"] charac-\n\nter  solely for broadcast on television\"  (hereinafter:  the \"Rey\n\nLicense\").   Rey  was to  receive a  fee for  assisting  with the\n\nediting and production of the episodes, and an additional royalty\n\namounting  to 10% of the  revenues from any  film telecasts.  The\n\nRey  License made no mention of ancillary product rights.  Never-\n\ntheless, LHP promoted the project to investors through a prospec-\n\ntus (hereinafter:  the \"1978 Private Placement Memorandum\") which\n\nrepresented, inter alia, that \"the production contract [with Rey]\n                       \n\ngives LHP the right to participate in the financing of  . . . the\n\noption . . .  to undertake the  exploitation of  other rights  to\n\n'Curious  George'  including manufacturing,  food,  licensing and\n\nother commercial areas of exploitation.\"\n\nB.  The Revised Agreements.\n                          \n\n          The film project soon  encountered delays and financial\n\nsetbacks.  By early 1979, though only 32 of the  104 episodes had\n\n                                4\n\nbeen completed, the original  investment funds had been virtually\n\nexhausted.  In order to rescue the project and complete the films\n\nto Rey's satisfaction, LHP  offered to arrange additional financ-\n\ning.  In consideration, LHP insisted that the Milktrain Agreement\n\nbe revised to permit LHP to assume control of the film production\n\nprocess  and to  receive higher  royalties on the  completed epi-\n\nsodes.  Milktrain  assented to these  revisions, and the  revised\n\nMilktrain Agreement (hereinafter:   the \"Revised Milktrain Agree-\n\nment\" or \"RMA\") was signed on November 5, 1979.\n\n          As prelude  to its  description of the  new obligations\n\nbetween Milktrain and LHP, the RMA recited that Milktrain and LHP\n\nowned \"the rights to Curious George which have been obtained from\n\n. . . Rey\" under the Rey License.  The RMA further stated that:\n\n          Investors  acquiring  the episodes  shall ac-\n          quire all right,  title and interest therein,\n          without limitation or reserve,  including the\n          original negative . . . .\n\n          LHP shall have the right to participate on an\n          equal basis with  [Milktrain] in their  right\n          of  first refusal  after  the present  agency\n          rights expire to  undertake the  exploitation\n          of  other rights to Curious George, including\n          manufacturing, food, licensing and the publi-\n          cation of the 104 episodes in book form . . .\n          in  accordance with  the  rights  granted  to\n          [Milktrain] and  LHP [by Rey] in [the Revised\n          Rey License].1\n\n          Simultaneously  with the  negotiation of  the RMA,  LHP\n\nproposed several  changes in the Rey  License, including language\n\n                    \n\n     1Shortly thereafter, Milktrain apparently assigned its share\nof ancillary  product licensing  rights to LHP,  leaving LHP  the\nsole owner of these rights.\n\n                                5\n\nwhich would have  granted LHP the  immediate right to  \"undertake\n\nthe exploitation  of other rights to  'Curious George,' including\n\nmanufacturing,  food, licensing  and the  publication of  the 104\n\nepisodes in  book form.\"   Rey  rejected  the LHP  proposal in  a\n\nletter to Richard G.  D. Lafferty (president and C.E.O.  of LHP):\n\n\"I have repeatedly stated to Milktrain and to you that I will not\n\nconsider negotiating such rights before the films are done.\"  Rey\n\ndid  consent, however, to certain changes to the royalty arrange-\n\nments, whereby Rey  would receive  a 10% share  of film  revenues\n\nonly \"after  the investors  have recouped [their  investment] and\n\ncertain soft dollar commitments . . . have been paid.\"\n\n          On November 5, 1979, concurrently with the execution of\n\nthe Revised  Milktrain Agreement,  a revised  version of the  Rey\n\nLicense  (hereinafter:  the  \"Revised Rey License\"  or \"RRL\") was\n\nexecuted,  incorporating  these   changes,  and  superseding  the\n\noriginal  Rey License.   The  RRL recited  that the  original Rey\n\nLicense  had granted Milktrain and  LHP the right  to produce and\n\ndistribute animated \"Curious George\" films \"for  television view-\n\ning,\"  but  made no  mention  of the  \"ancillary  product\" rights\n\nunsuccessfully sought by LHP.\n\n          As agreed, LHP undertook  to arrange further  financing\n\nto complete the film project.  On November 23, 1979, LHP released\n\nanother  prospectus (hereinafter:   the  \"1979 Private  Placement\n\nMemorandum\") to  which it  attached the Revised  Milktrain Agree-\n\nment.  The 1979  Private Placement Memorandum again  stressed the\n\nprospect of  eventual revenues from ancillary  products but noted\n\n                                6\n\nthat these rights \"have yet to be negotiated\" with Rey.\n\nC.   The Ancillary Products Agreement.\n                                     \n\n          Production  of the  104  TV episodes  was completed  in\n\n1982.   On January 3, 1983,  an Ancillary Products  Agreement (or\n\n\"APA\") was signed by Rey and LHP, granting LHP a general right to\n\nlicense \"Curious George\" in spin-off (\"ancillary\") products for a\n\nrenewable term of five  years.  The APA defined  \"ancillary prod-\n\nucts\" as:\n\n          All  tangible  goods  . . . excluding  books,\n          films, tapes, records,  or video  productions\n          . . . . However, for stories already owned by\n          [LHP]  and which  have been  produced as  104\n          episodes  under the  license  granted in  the\n          January, 1978 agreement  and the  November 5,\n          1979  revision of that agreement, [LHP] shall\n          have  the  right  to  produce  books,  films,\n          tapes, records and video productions of these\n          episodes  under  this  Agreement, subject  to\n          [Rey's]  prior  approval  . . .  which  prior\n          approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nIn  return for these rights, Rey  was to receive one-third of the\n\nroyalties on  the licensed products, with  certain minimum annual\n\npayments guaranteed.   Rey retained the  right to disapprove  any\n                                                                 \n\nproduct, and  to propose changes  which would make  a disapproved\n       \n\nproduct  acceptable to her.   The APA provided,  inter alia, that\n                                                           \n\nRey's approval would not be withheld \"unreasonably.\"\n\nD.  The Houghton Mifflin Contract.\n                                 \n\n          Following  the  execution  of  the  Ancillary  Products\n\nAgreement, LHP assigned its licensing rights to a new subsidiary,\n\nCurgeo Enterprises,  which turned its attention  to licensing the\n\n                                7\n\n\"Curious  George\"  character  in  various  product  forms.2    On\n\nMarch 27, 1984, Curgeo executed  a contract with Houghton Mifflin\n\nCompany to publish the  104 television film episodes in  the form\n\nof a children's book series.  The contract provided that Houghton\n\nMifflin  would publish  at least  four books,  with illustrations\n\ndrawn  directly from the film  negatives, in each  year from 1984\n\nthrough 1987; the contract was renewable  for an additional five-\n\nyear term  if LHP and Rey  agreed to extend the  APA beyond 1987.\n\nPursuant to  the contract, Houghton Mifflin  published four books\n\neach year from 1984 through 1987.\n\n          In  1987, LHP  notified  Houghton Mifflin  that it  had\n\ndeclined to extend  the APA, but that Curgeo  had \"entered into a\n\nnew  operating agreement which permits  us to continue  to act in\n\nthe capacity  in  which we  have been  acting for  the last  five\n\nyears. . . . [Y]ou are free to pick up your option to renew.\"  In\n\nresponse, Houghton  Mifflin extended  its contract for  the addi-\n\ntional  five-year term,  publishing an  additional four  books in\n\n1988 and again in 1989.  It ceased publication of the book series\n\nin 1990, when Rey advised that the APA had been cancelled.\n\nE.   Other Product Licenses.\n                           \n\n          Curgeo  moved  aggressively  to  license  the  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" character in other  product areas as well.   Beginning in\n\n1983, the  \"Curious George\"  TV  episodes were  licensed to  Sony\n\n                    \n\n     2Curgeo  Enterprises  is not  named  in  the Rey  complaint;\nCurgeo  Agencies Inc.  and  Curgeo Overseas,  Inc., are  named as\ndefendants.   We  refer to  the  three entities  collectively  as\n\"Curgeo.\"\n\n                                8\n\nCorporation,  which transferred  the images  from the  television\n\nfilm negatives to  videotape.   LHP takes the  position that  the\n\nSony video license was entered pursuant to the RRL; Rey claims it\n\nis subject to the APA.  See supra at pp. 6-7.\n                                 \n\n          In 1983, Curgeo licensed  \"Curious George\" to Eden Toys\n\nInc., which proposed to market a \"Curious George\" plush  toy.  In\n\nthe beginning, Rey rejected Eden's proposed  designs for the toy,\n\nbut Eden eventually proposed  several versions which were accept-\n\nable to Rey.   The plush toy was marketed from  1983 to 1990, but\n\nexperienced poor sales and  generated less revenue than expected.\n\nEden blamed the  poor market performance on  Rey's alterations to\n\nEden's original design proposals.\n\n          In 1987,  Curgeo  received  a  commitment  from  Sears,\n\nRoebuck  to market  \"Curious  George\" pajamas  through the  Sears\n\ncatalog.   The  Sears pajama  project promised high  returns, but\n\ncatalog deadlines  necessitated immediate  approval of  a product\n\ndesign.   Glen Konkle,  Curgeo's agent, brought  Rey a  prototype\n\npajama and a flat paper sketch of \"Curious George\" which had been\n\nproposed as  the basis for the  final pattern.  Rey  rejected the\n\nproposal, complaining  that the  pajama material was  \"hard, ugly\n\n[and] bright yellow,\" and that the sketch of \"Curious George\" was\n\n\"plump\" and \"not  recognizable.\"  The catalog deadline passed and\n\nthe pajama manufacturers withdrew their bids.  In addition, Beach\n\nPaper  Products,  which had  orally  agreed  to license  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" for a line  of paper novelties, withdrew its  offer after\n\nlearning that  \"Curious George\" products would  not receive expo-\n\n                                9\n\nsure in the Sears catalog.\n\n          In 1988, Curgeo licensed  \"Curious George\" to DLM Inc.,\n\nwhich intended to use the \"Curious George\" character in a trilogy\n\nof educational software.  Rey approved the software in principle,\n\nand production began in July 1988.   In August 1988, however, DLM\n\nwithdrew its plans to complete the \"trilogy\" after Rey telephoned\n\nDLM's project director and  harshly criticized the design  of the\n\nfirst software  product and the accompanying  manual developed by\n\nDLM.\n\nF.  The Ancillary Products Agreement Renewal.\n                                            \n\n          Due  in part  to these  product rejections,  LHP earned\n\nless money than it anticipated from ancillary products.  When the\n\nAPA came up for renewal in January 1988, LHP declined to exercise\n\nits  option for  an  additional  five-year  term.   Instead,  the\n\nparties agreed to renew on  a month-to-month basis, terminable by\n\neither  party  on one  month's notice.    Rey's royalty  rate was\n\nincreased to 50% (effective January 3, 1988), but with no guaran-\n\nteed minimum payment.  On April 10, 1989, Rey terminated the APA.\n\nLHP responded by advising that Curgeo would \"continue to adminis-\n\nter those licenses which [remained] outstanding and report to you\n\nfrom time  to  time accordingly.\"    LHP thereupon  continued  to\n\nmarket the Sony  videos and  to publish the  television films  in\n\nbook form under the Houghton Mifflin agreements.\n\nG.   \"Curious George\" Goes to Court.\n                                   \n\n          On February 8,  1991, Rey filed  suit against Lafferty,\n\n                                10\n\nCurgeo and  LHP, in  connection with LHP's  continuing, allegedly\n\nunauthorized production  of the  Houghton Mifflin books  and Sony\n\nvideos.  Rey's complaint alleged violations of federal copyright,\n\ntrademark  and unfair-competition  statutes, breach  of contract,\n\nand  violations  of Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A (\"chapter  93A\"); it\n\nsought to  enjoin further violations and to recover unpaid royal-\n\nties on the books and videos.  LHP countersued, claiming that Rey\n\nunreasonably had withheld approval  of various products while the\n\nAPA  remained  in force.   The  LHP  complaint alleged  breach of\n\ncontract, interference with contractual and advantageous business\n\nrelationships, and violation of chapter 93A.\n\n          After a four-day bench  trial, the district court found\n\nfor Rey on  her claims  for breach of  contract, ruling that  the\n\nbook and video licenses were governed by the APA and that Rey was\n\nentitled to recover $256,327  in royalties.  The court  found for\n\nLHP  on  several LHP  counterclaims,  however,  holding that  Rey\n\nunreasonably  had withheld  approval  of, inter  alia, the  Sears\n                                                     \n\npajamas, the DLM software, and  Eden's original plush toy design.\n\nLHP was  awarded $317,000,  representing lost profits  and conse-\n\nquential damages  resulting from  Rey's rejection of  these prod-\n\nucts.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          \"Under  Massachusetts law,  the  'interpretation  of  a\n\ncontract is  ordinarily  a  question  of  law  for  the  court'.\"\n\n                                11\n\nFairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v.

The evidence cut both ways.  On the one hand, the RMA\n\nand  the RRL were executed  at approximately the  same time, with\n\nsome overlap in their internal references and subject matter.  On\n\nthe  other hand, their  respective provisions are  less in unison\n\nthan parallel.5   Most  importantly, the written  and circumstan-\n\ntial indicia sharply  contradict any suggestion  of a meeting  of\n\nthe minds relating to  the licensing of ancillary products.   Rey\n\ndid not  participate in negotiating the RMA, did not sign it, was\n\n                    \n\n     5Even  if the  RMA  and RRL  were  jointly construed,  their\nlanguage might point away  from the interpretation urged  by LHP.\nSection 2(i) of the RMA granted LHP's investors \"all right, title\nand  interest\" in the  104 T.V. episodes,  \"without limitation or\nreserve,\"  but   1(a) tempered this  grant by defining the rights\nas \"described herein, and  set forth in Schedule 'A'  [the RRL].\"\nThis  language suggests  that  the \"right,  title, and  interest\"\nlanguage of  the RMA was meant  only to confirm  and restate, and\n                                                            \nnot to expand upon,  the RRL's parallel, but more  limited, grant\nof  rights.

Finally, the parties' intention to exclude the Hough-\n\nton Mifflin books from the RRL, and their intention to cover them\n\nin  the  APA, are  corroborated  by  their subsequent  course  of\n\ndealing:  among  other things, the record shows that LHP paid Rey\n\nroyalties on the books and videos on several occasions at the 33%\n                                                                 \n\nrate  required under the APA, rather than the 10% rate prescribed\n                            \n\nby the  RRL, and  that Curgeo  expressly keyed  the dates of  the\n\nHoughton Mifflin  contract to  the term (and  anticipated renewal\n                                                                 \n\nterm) of the Ancillary Products Agreement:\n                                         \n\n          By September 30, 1987,  Curgeo [will]  inform\n          [Houghton  Mifflin] in writing  as to whether\n          Curgeo  has exercised  its option  to exploit\n          the   character   \"Curious  George\"   through\n          December 31,  1993 and,  if Curgeo  has exer-\n          cised  said option,  Curgeo  shall  give  the\n          Publisher the option to extend this Agreement\n          through December 31, 1993.\n\n          It was for  the district court to balance  the evidence\n\nin the  first instance, see  Holmes Realty Trust, 517  N.E. 2d at\n                                                \n\n504, and  we discern no sound  reason to disagree  with its find-\n\nings,  particularly  on \"clear  error\"  review.

The RRL contained no grant of rights to produce the Hough-\n\nton  Mifflin  books, and  the APA,  which  granted the  right \"to\n\nproduce books . . . of these episodes,\" obligated LHP  to pay Rey\n\nroyalties on the books without  regard to whether LHP's investors\n\nhad  recouped their  investment on  the television  film project.\n\nThus,  the district  court  did not  err  in finding  that  LHP's\n\nwithholding of the Houghton  Mifflin book royalties was wrongful,\n\nand we affirm its ruling on this point.  \n\n                    \n\n     6We reject  LHP's further  contention that Rey's  failure to\nprotest publication of  the four Houghton  Mifflin books in  1990\nestops her from cancelling the book and video contracts under the\nAPA.

In our  view, Rey's conduct\ndoes not require an inference that she acquiesced in the publica-\ntion  of these books  under the APA.   Rather, Rey  protested the\npublication  of the  four  books  by  filing suit  shortly  after\nrealizing the unauthorized nature of Houghton Mifflin's continued\npublication.  The district court apparently found that Rey's one-\nyear delay, dating from  the first unauthorized publication until\nthe filing of Rey's  suit for injunctive relief, was  not \"unrea-\nsonable\"  in the  circumstances, and  we  decline to  disturb its\nfindings on this issue.\n\n                                18\n\n     2.

The district  court thought not:  the  parties' \"reference\n   \n\nto television viewing  . . . in a licensing agreement  . . . does\n\nnot include  [video technology] . . .  which probably was  not in\n\nexistence at the time that the rights were given.\"\n\n          a.  \"New Uses\" and Copyright Law.\n                                          \n\n          For  purposes  of the  present  appeal,  we accept  the\n\nuncontested  district  court  finding  that  the  relevant  video\n\ntechnology \"was not  in existence  at the time  that the  rights\"\n\nwere granted under  the RRL  in January 1979.   Consequently,  it\n\nmust be  inferred that the  parties did not  specifically contem-\n\nplate  television  \"viewing\" of  the  \"Curious  George\" films  in\n\nvideocassette form at the  time the RRL was signed.  Such absence\n\nof  specific intent  typifies cases  which address \"new  uses\" of\n\nlicensed  materials, i.e., novel technological developments which\n                         \n\ngenerate unforeseen applications for a previously  licensed work.\n\nSee  Melville B.

Television  requires  an\n          intermediary  network,  station, or  cable to\n          send the television  signals into  consumers'\n          homes.   The menu of  entertainment appearing\n          on  television is controlled  entirely by the\n          intermediary and, thus, the consumer's selec-\n          tion is limited to what is available on vari-\n          ous channels.  Moreover, equipped merely with\n          a conventional television set, a consumer has\n          no means of capturing any part of the televi-\n          sion  display; when  the program  is over  it\n          vanishes,  and the  consumer is  powerless to\n          replay  it.   Because they  originate outside\n          the  home,  television signals  are ephemeral\n          and beyond the viewer's grasp.\n\n          Videocassettes, of course, allow viewing of a\n          markedly  different  nature. . . .  By  their\n          very  essence, . . .  videocassettes liberate\n          viewers  from  the constraints  otherwise in-\n          herent in television,  and eliminate the  in-\n          volvement of an intermediary, such  as a net-\n          work.\n\n          Television  and  videocassette  display  thus\n          have very  little in common  besides the fact\n          that a conventional  monitor of a  television\n          set  may be  used both to  receive television\n          signals and to  exhibit a videocassette.   It\n          is in  light of this fact  that Paramount ar-\n          gues that VCRs  are equivalent to \"exhibition\n          by  means of  television.\"    Yet, even  that\n          assertion is flawed.  Playing a videocassette\n          on a VCR does  not require a standard televi-\n          sion  set  capable  of  receiving  television\n          signals by cable or  by broadcast; it is only\n          necessary to have a  monitor capable of  dis-\n          playing the material on the magnetized tape.\n\nId. at 853-54.\n   \n\n          Most  recently,  in  Tele-Pac,  Inc. v.

Rather,  the  RRL appears  to  contemplate a\n\ncomparatively limited and particular grant of  rights, encompass-\n\ning only the 104 film episodes and leaving future  uses of \"Curi-\n\nous  George\"  to  later  negotiation in  the  ancillary  products\n\nagreement.   Although  the RRL  conversely contains  no \"specific\n\nlimiting language,\"  compare Cohen, 845  F.2d at 853,  we believe\n                                  \n\nsuch limitation is reasonably inferable from the situation of the\n\n                                26\n\nparties  and  the \"general  tenor of  the  section\" in  which the\n\n\"television viewing\" rights were granted.\n\n          Second, as properly  noted in Cohen, \"television  view-\n                                             \n\ning\" and \"videocassette viewing\" are not coextensive terms.

After careful  consideration, we  must agree\n\nwith Rey that the district court misapplied the APA. \n\n          The  product-approval procedure under  the APA required\n\n                    \n\n     9LHP does not  challenge the district court  ruling that its\ncounterclaims  for interference with contractual and advantageous\nbusiness relationships,  breach of  the implied covenant  of good\nfaith  and  fair dealing,  and  unfair  business practices  under\nchapter 93A were time-barred.\n\n                                29\n\nthat:\n\n          LHP  will submit product or other information\n          sufficient to describe the product to you for\n          prior approval.   When a product is submitted\n          . . . we will wait two weeks  before proceed-\n          ing.  If we do not receive any disapproval of\n          the product from you  within two weeks we are\n          entitled to  presume that you approve  of the\n          product.   If you do disapprove  of any prod-\n          uct,  you  will,  if  feasible,  suggest such\n          changes  to  LHP  as may  render  the product\n          acceptable to  you,  or, if  you cannot  make\n          such feasible suggestions, you may  refuse to\n          approve the product.   Product approval  will\n          not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe term \"product\" is not defined in the APA.

Moreover, assuming  there\n\nexisted some material ground for withholding product approval, it\n\nwould need to be communicated, consistent with contractual speci-\n\nfications,  \"within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner,\n\ni.e., in  a manner which makes it  possible for [the licensee] to\n    \n\nrework the [product]  in order to meet . . . approval.\"  See Zim,\n                                                                \n\n573  F.2d at 1324.

In the\n                           \n\ncontext  of this case, for example, Rey could not impose approval\n\nstandards  which would  effectively eliminate  all potential  for\n\nprofitable  use of  the \"Curious  George\" property;  the parties'\n\nmutual assent, in the APA, that Rey would be  entitled to minimum\n\nroyalty payments,  plainly  implied a  mutual understanding  that\n\nsome licensing of the \"Curious George\" character would be accept-\n    \n\nable,  in order  to enable  sales from  which royalties  might be\n\ngenerated.

The Sears Pajamas.\n                           \n\n          The district court ruled that Rey acted unreasonably by\n\nbasing  her  disapproval of  the  Sears  project on  the  \"junky\"\n\nquality  of the pajama material which  would bear \"Curious Georg-\n\ne's\" likeness.11   As  we have stated,  see supra  at pp.  32-34,\n                                                 \n\nthe basis for the  district court's finding of \"unreasonableness\"\n\nwas  insufficient as a  matter of law.   Rey did not unreasonably\n\nwithhold approval of the Sears pajama  project as unbefitting the\n\n\"Curious George\"  image protected  by her copyright,  because the\n\ngrounds for  withholding approval were reasonably  related to the\n\n                    \n\n     11The district  court did not address  the aesthetic reasons\nRey  gave  for rejecting  the  Sears project,  viz.,  the \"bright\n                                                   \nyellow\"  color  of the  pajama  material  and the  unrecognizable\n\"plump\"  depiction of \"Curious George.\"  We believe these grounds\nwere not unreasonable.\n\n                                35\n\nintegrity  and commercial  value of her  artistic creation.

The Beach Paper Products.\n                                  \n\n          Our  conclusion that Rey  reasonably rejected the Sears\n\nproject disposes of LHP's claim for damages relating to the Beach\n\npaper  products as well.  Rey never saw, much less \"disapproved,\"\n\nthe  Beach  paper products:   as  the undisputed  evidence shows,\n\nBeach  withdrew its proposal when the Sears project fell through;\n\nit never reached agreement  with LHP or presented any  product to\n\nRey for  approval.   Therefore,  LHP's claimed  right to  recover\n\npotential profits from  the Beach project could  be justified, if\n\nat  all, only as consequential damages  resulting from a wrongful\n                                      \n\nrejection of the  Sears project.   As the  Sears project was  not\n\nwrongfully  rejected under  the  terms of  the  APA, LHP  is  not\n\nentitled to consequential damages  related to Beach's anticipated\n\n                    \n\n     12LHP  nonetheless  maintains that  Rey's  rejection of  the\nSears  pajama project was  \"unreasonable,\" insofar as  it was not\ncommunicated  in  a manner  which  \"ma[de] it  possible  . . . to\nrework  the [product] in order  to obtain . . .  approval.\"  Zim,\n                                                                \n573 F.2d at 1324.  LHP argues that time pressures inherent in the\nSears catalog deadlines  made the presentation  of the pajamas  a\n\"one-shot deal,\"  with \"reworking\" of the  design impossible once\nrejection  had occurred.  It insists that the \"lousy material\" in\nthe pajamas    a  basis for Rey's disapproval     was required by\nfederal fire  safety standards;  no other material  was available\nfor use in the product.\n     Even assuming  these fact-based arguments are  well founded,\nhowever     an assessment we  are in no  position to make  on the\npresent record    they are beside the point:  the APA's  \"reason-\nableness\" constraint did not oblige Rey to apply lower standards,\nor  to relax  her vigilance  in policing  ancillary uses  for the\n\"Curious George\" character, merely  because deadlines were  tight\nor objections to the product could not be cured.  See APA at p. 3\n                                                     \n(\"if you  disapprove  of  any  product, you  will,  if  feasible,\n                                                                \nsuggest such changes to  [LHP] as may render the  product accept-\nable to you\") (emphasis added).  \n\n                                36\n\nprofits.

We believe  an author's\n     \n\ndiscretionary right to disapprove an ancillary product, as not in\n\nkeeping  with the  aesthetic image the  author envisions  for her\n\nartistic creation,  reasonably may be  made to depend  on product\n\nconformity, at least where, as here, conformity with the author's\n\naesthetic standard would neither  set unreasonably high levels of\n\ncommercial  practicality nor  foreclose all  prospect  of profit-\n                                                     \n\nability on which the  contract was predicated.  See  supra at pp.\n                                                          \n\n33-34.\n\n          The evidence before  the district court clearly  showed\n\nthat Rey imposed a demanding aesthetic standard for the design of\n\nthe  Eden Toys  doll.13  Eden's  frustration at  Rey's meticulous\n\nimmersion  in the details of toy design may indeed be understand-\n\nable, the more so perhaps because of the irascible terms in which\n\nRey appears to  have chosen  to couch her  product criticisms  on\n\noccasion.  Even viewing the evidence as a whole in the light most\n\n                    \n\n     13For example,  she relocated the felt  patterns on \"Curious\nGeorge's\"  face  by a  few  millimeters  and rejected  particular\ncolors and color  combinations which Eden thought would  make the\ndoll more saleable.\n\n                                38\n\nflattering to LHP, however, we cannot conclude that her  proposed\n\nchanges were unrelated to her  legitimate artistic concerns or to\n\nher desire  to protect the  aesthetic integrity  of the  \"Curious\n\nGeorge\" image.\n\n          \"Reasonableness\"  likewise  requires,  of course,  that\n\nchanges be made  \"within a  reasonable time and  in a  reasonable\n\nmanner, i.e., in a manner which makes it possible for [the licen-\n            \n\nsee] to  rework the [product] in  order to meet .  . . approval.\"\n\nSee  Zim, 573  F.2d at 1324.   The  evidence before  the district\n        \n\ncourt, which we  have examined in detail, did not show that Rey's\n\nproduct criticisms, though caustic,  were made in an unreasonable\n\ntime or manner.  And although the record is replete with testimo-\n\nny that  Eden and  LHP grumbled  about Rey's product  criticisms,\n\nneither  Eden  nor LHP  ever communicated  to  Rey, prior  to the\n                                                  \n\npresent  lawsuit, that her proposed changes to the Eden plush toy\n\nproducts were  impracticable or even unduly  burdensome.14  Since\n\nRey's  objections to  Eden's original  toy  design were  based on\n\ncriteria  reasonably  related  to  her  legitimate  artistic  and\n\naesthetic concerns about the proposed ancillary product, and were\n\ncommunicated  in a  time and  manner which  would permit  Eden to\n\nconform  the product, we conclude that  Rey's rejection of Eden's\n\nproduct designs was not \"unreasonable.\"\n\n                    \n\n     14For  example,   the  President  of  Eden  Toys  testified:\n\"[W]hat we tried to do, therefore, was to  get very specific, and\nsay: If you  want it moved  three millimeters to the  left, we'll\n                                                                 \nmove it, but let's all agree on that's where it's going to be . .\n       \n. .\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                39\n\n     4.   The DLM Software.\n                          \n\n          Finally, we consider whether  Rey's alleged rudeness to\n\nDonna Craighead, the DLM project manager, amounted to  an \"unrea-\n\nsonable  withholding of approval\" of  the DLM software project in\n\nviolation of  the APA.   We  conclude that  it did  not.  As  all\n\nparties  agree, the  licensing  arrangement between  DLM and  LHP\n\ncovered only the first  installment in the proposed  DLM software\n\ntrilogy, the first installment  was approved by Rey prior  to her\n                                            \n\ntelephone  conversation  with  Craighead, and  DLM  continued  to\n\nmanufacture and market the first-installment  software even after\n\nRey's intemperate remarks.  Given  the fact that Rey's statements\n\nled to no  curtailment in the production or  sale of the licensed\n\nsoftware,  we are unable to discern any relevant respect in which\n\nRey's statements  to Craighead could be  considered a \"rejection\"\n\nof the product for which LHP had issued its license to DLM.\n\n          The district court apparently  thought that Rey's harsh\n\ncriticism of the first  software installment may have discouraged\n\nDLM from undertaking \"second and . . . later\" installments in the\n\nproposed trilogy.   Here, however, the  relevant consideration is\n\nthat these subsequent  installments had not yet  been licensed by\n                                                              \n\nthe time Rey communicated her criticism about the  first software\n                                                        \n\nproduct  and manual.   Even  were Rey's  criticism  actionable in\n\ntort,  as an  \"intentional  interference  with contractual  rela-\n\ntions,\"  see Restatement (Second) of Torts    766, or as a breach\n            \n\nof the implied good-faith  duty not to interfere with  LHP's per-\n\nformance under  the APA,  it nevertheless was  not actionable  in\n\n                                40\n\ncontract.   Under  the plain  terms  of the  APA,  Rey could  not\n\n\"reject\" products  not yet licensed or  presented for approval.15\n\n          LHP  attempts to  extend  the APA's  plain language  by\n\ncharacterizing Rey's criticism of the DLM project as \"essentially\n\nrevok[ing]  product  approval  [of]  the  DLM  software  concept\"\n                                                                \n\nalready approved  by Rey.  LHP does not define the term \"software\n\nconcept,\" but clearly uses it to encompass not only the first DLM\n\nproduct but  all subsequent installments in  the planned trilogy.\n\nSuch  an interpretation  would not  withstand analysis  under the\n\nlanguage of  the APA,  however, nor  comport with  the undisputed\n\nrecord evidence.\n\n          We reject LHP's  overly expansive definition  of \"prod-\n\nuct\" in the present context.   By lumping all DLM software  prod-\n\nucts under the umbrella of a single software \"concept,\" LHP would\n\neviscerate Rey's retained right to grant, or reasonably withhold,\n\napproval  for  distinct generations  of  software  products in  a\n\nparticular  software series.   All conceptually  related articles\n                                               \n\nidentified by  LHP as  part of  the same  series would  be deemed\n\napproved,  sight unseen;  the policing  of the  integrity of  the\n\nconceptual relationship  presumably having ceased to  be a matter\n\nof legitimate concern  to Rey.  Courts universally recognize that\n\nthe  elasticity of contract  language is  limited by  the natural\n\nmeaning of its terms and their context.  See K Mart, 892 F.2d  at\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n     15The district court ruled that the tort claims  arising out\nof  \"most of\"  Rey's  conduct were  time-barred.   LHP  does  not\nchallenge this ruling.  See supra n.9 and accompanying text.\n                                 \n\n                                41\n\n1085; Boston Edison Corp., 856 F.2d at 365.  LHP's interpretation\n                         \n\nstrips the \"product approval\" term  from its context and depletes\n\nits natural meaning.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Under the APA, Rey is entitled to recover the royalties\n\nwrongly withheld on  the Houghton Mifflin books  and Sony videos;\n\nand we affirm the district court rulings respecting these claims.\n\nThe APA likewise  entitled Rey to  withhold approval of  licensed\n\nancillary  products  on reasonable  grounds;  thus,  LHP was  not\n\nentitled to  recover damages for Rey's reasonable exercise of her\n\nright to withhold approval of the Sears pajama project, the Beach\n\npaper products,  the Eden  Toys project, or  the DLM  software.16\n\nAccordingly, the damages awards to LHP are vacated.\n\n          Affirmed in  part, reversed in part;  costs are awarded\n                                                                 \n\nto Rey.\n      \n\n                    \n\n     16We  have considered  all other  arguments advanced  by the\nparties  and find  them either to  be wanting  or, alternatively,\nmoot.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we note\nthat, because  we conclude that Rey  reasonably withheld approval\nof  the Sears project, the Eden plush toys, and the DLM software,\nwe  need not  consider  whether LHP's  estimates  of lost  future\nprofits from  these products  were sufficiently certain  and non-\nspeculative to support an award of damages.
