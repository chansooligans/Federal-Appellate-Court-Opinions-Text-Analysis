The plaintiffs, a collection of\n\nlabor organizations and public employees, sued Governor Luis A.\n\nFortuño and a number of other Puerto Rico government officials\n\n(collectively \"defendants\") in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.         The plaintiffs alleged, among other\n\nclaims, that Puerto Rico's Act No. 7 violates the Contract Clause\n\nin Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution.                 The\n\ndistrict    court,   pursuant   to    Federal   Rule    of   Civil    Procedure\n\n12(b)(6), dismissed the plaintiffs' claims.            Because we find that\n\nthe plaintiffs' third amended complaint (\"complaint\") failed to\n\nstate a claim for a violation of the Contract Clause, we affirm.\n\n                        I. Facts and Background\n\n            When reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, \"we must assume\n\nthe truth of all well-pleaded facts and give the plaintiff the\n\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.\"             Thomas v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 542 F.3d 944, 948 (1st Cir. 2008).             \"Under Rule 12(b)(6),\n\nthe district court may consider only facts and documents that are\n\npart of or incorporated into the complaint . . . .\"                  Trans-Spec\n\nTruck Serv., Inc. v. Caterpillar Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 320 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     That said, \"when a complaint's factual allegations are\n\nexpressly linked to — and admittedly dependent upon — a document\n\n(the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document\n\neffectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can\n\nreview it . . . .\"     Id. (internal marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f               In 1998, Puerto Rico enacted Act No. 45, which gave\n\nemployees \"the right to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement\n\n[('CBA')] with the agency through its exclusive representative . .\n\n. .\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1451j.      Act No. 45 also established\n\nprocedures       for   resolving   impasses     in    collective     bargaining\n\nnegotiations, and for addressing disputes arising under the CBAs.\n\nSee id. et seq.        By the time the plaintiffs filed this suit, fifty\n\nPuerto Rico government agencies had negotiated CBAs covering over\n\n50,000 public employees.\n\n               On March 9, 2009, Governor Fortuño signed Act No. 7 —\n\nentitled      the   \"Law   Declaring   a   Fiscal    State   of   Emergency   and\n\nEstablishing a Comprehensive Fiscal Stabilization Plan to Save\n\nPuerto Rico Credit\" — into law.1             See 2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7.\n\nAccording to the \"Public Policy Statement of Purpose\" included in\n\nthe bill, Act No. 7 was intended to eliminate Puerto Rico's $3.2\n\nbillion structural deficit.        Id. ch. I, § 2.\n\n               As a cost-saving measure purportedly aimed at addressing\n\nthis deficit, Act No. 7 laid out a three-phase plan to reduce the\n\ngovernment payroll.        See id. ch. III, § 35.       Phase I established a\n\nvoluntary \"permanent workday reduction program\" for certain senior\n\n\n\n       1\n      In analyzing Act No. 7, we use the certified English\ntranslation filed in the district court by the plaintiffs. The\ndefendants note that Act No. 7 was later amended, after the\nplaintiffs filed the translated version with the district court,\nbut neither party asserts that those amendments are material to the\nanalysis here.\n\n                                       -3-\n\femployees, and it provided financial incentives for all employees\n\nto resign voluntarily.    Id. ch. III, § 36.   Phase II authorized\n\ninvoluntary, seniority-based layoffs upon a determination that\n\nPhase I had failed to create the necessary savings on its own.   Id.\n\nch. III, § 37.    Although various categories of employees were\n\nexempted, if Phase II was to be implemented it could result in as\n\nmany as 40,000 layoffs.   Finally, Phase III temporarily suspended,\n\nfor a period of two years, a plethora of statutory, contractual,\n\nand other provisions governing the conditions of employment for the\n\nremaining affected public employees.     Id. ch. III, § 38.      This\n\nphase effectively froze salaries and suspended other benefits and\n\nprotections within the CBAs.\n\n          The complaint characterized Act No. 7's impact as\n\n          substantially    impair[ing]   all   statutory\n          covenants and contractual obligations included\n          in the extant [CBAs] between the exclusive\n          bargaining representatives and the government\n          agencies related to, inter alia, promotions,\n          demotions, transfers; retention and lay-offs;\n          reduction in work force and any requirement\n          prior   to   order   a  reduction  in   force;\n          reinstatement and registry of illegibility;\n          any cross utilization, prohibition to use\n          employees from another appropriate units; any\n          prohibition to consolidate job duties and job\n          classifications; any limitation to management\n          rights; any disposition that the agency has to\n          comply with contract obligations in conflict\n          with Act No. 7; seniority, if in conflict with\n          Act No. 7; dispute resolution process, reviews\n          and appeals if in conflict with Act No. 7.\n\n          Act No. 7 did not, however, rely solely on cost-cutting\n\nmeasures to address Puerto Rico's deficit, but also included\n\n                                -4-\n\frevenue increases.      To name just a few examples, Act No. 7\n\neliminated various tax credits and exemptions; increased the excise\n\ntax on cigarettes and certain alcoholic beverages; levied new taxes\n\non certain banks and insurers; and added a residential property\n\ntax.   2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7, pmbl.\n\n           Although the complaint acknowledged that Puerto Rico's\n\npurported reason for enacting Act No. 7 was \"an alleged fiscal\n\ncrisis and the potential degradation of government bonds,\"       it\n\ncontended that \"the averred purpose is neither significant nor\n\nlegitimate\" and \"some or all the obligations of contracts impaired\n\nby [Act No. 7] are not character appropriate to the declared\n\npurpose . . . .\"    Similarly, the complaint stated that \"there were\n\nother available alternatives with lesser impact to the paramount\n\nconstitutional rights affected by this legislation.\"    It did not,\n\nhowever, attach or describe in detail the contracts allegedly\n\nimpaired, or specify any \"other available alternatives.\"        The\n\ncomplaint did aver that \"[t]he suspension of rights and impairment\n\nof contractual obligations for two (2) years, is unreasonable,\n\nparticularly considering the life of all [CBAs] can only extend to\n\nthree (3) years.\"\n\n           On December 14, 2009, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, dismissing all of the plaintiffs'\n\nfederal claims and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover the plaintiffs' Puerto Rico law claims.    With respect to the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fContract Clause claim on appeal, the district court held that the\n\nplaintiffs       failed   to   sufficiently   allege   that   Act   No.   7's\n\nimpairments of the CBAs were unreasonable or unnecessary to an\n\nimportant government interest, and it therefore rejected the claim\n\nthat those impairments ran afoul of the Contract Clause.2\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n               This court reviews de novo a district court's Rule\n\n12(b)(6) dismissal.       Thomas, 542 F.3d at 948.\n\n               \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\n\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to\n\nrelief that is plausible on its face.'\"          Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n\n544, 570 (2007)). Facial plausibility is shown \"when the plaintiff\n\npleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n\nId. Plausibility \"is not akin to a probability requirement, but it\n\nasks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.\"       Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).      Under this\n\nstandard, \"A pleading that offers 'labels and conclusions' or 'a\n\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not\n\ndo.'\"       Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).\n\n\n\n        2\n      The plaintiffs do not appeal the dismissal of their other\nfederal claims, including their alternative Contract Clause claim,\nwhich was grounded in the theory that Act No. 7 impaired certain\nstatutory covenants.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f               The Contract Clause provides that \"No State shall . .           .\n\npass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . . .\"3\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1.       Despite its unequivocal language,\n\nthis constitutional provision \"does not make unlawful every state\n\nlaw that conflicts with any contract . . . .\"                   Local Div. 589,\n\nAmalgamated Transit Union v. Massachusetts, 666 F.2d 618, 638 (1st\n\nCir.       1981).   Rather,   \"A   court's   task   is    'to    reconcile   the\n\nstrictures of the Contract Clause with the essential attributes of\n\nsovereign power necessarily reserved by the States to safeguard the\n\nwelfare of their citizens.'\"        Mercado-Boneta v. Administracion del\n\nFondo de Compensacion al Paciente, 125 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting U.S. Trust Co. of N.Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 20\n\n(1977)); accord Energy Reserves Grp., Inc. v. Kan. Power & Light\n\nCo., 459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983).\n\n               To that end, Contract Clause claims are analyzed under a\n\ntwo-pronged test.       Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Emps.' Ret. Sys.,\n\n173 F.3d 46, 59 (1st Cir. 1999).        The first question \"is 'whether\n\nthe state law has . . . operated as a substantial impairment of a\n\ncontractual relationship.'\"        Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 411\n\n(quoting Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244\n\n(1978)); accord Parella, 173 F.3d at 59.                 If the contract was\n\nsubstantially impaired, the court next turns to the second question\n\n\n\n       3\n      The defendants do not contest the Contract Clause's\napplicability to Puerto Rico, even though it is not a state.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fand asks whether the impairment was \"reasonable and necessary to\n\nserve an important government purpose.\"4       See U.S. Trust, 431 U.S.\n\nat 25; accord Parella, 173 F.3d at 59.       Where the state is alleged\n\nto have impaired a public contract to which it is a party, \"less\n\ndeference to a legislative determination of reasonableness and\n\nnecessity is required, because the State's self-interest is at\n\nstake.\"    Parella, 173 F.3d at 59 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n            Assuming arguendo that the plaintiffs pled sufficient\n\nfacts to satisfy the substantial impairment inquiry, we turn to the\n\nsecond    prong   of   this   analysis:   whether   the   impairment   was\n\nreasonable and necessary to effectuate an important governmental\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      This two-pronged test is often framed as a three-part\nanalysis:   \"(1) whether the contractual impairment is in fact\nsubstantial; if so, (2) whether the law serves a significant public\npurpose, . . . (3) whether the means chosen to accomplish this\npurpose are reasonable and appropriate.\" Sal Tinnerello & Sons,\nInc. v. Town of Stonington, 141 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir. 1998)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Houlton\nCitizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 191 (1st Cir.\n1999) (dividing the second inquiry into two subparts: whether there\nis a legitimate public purpose for the state action and whether the\nadjustment of contractual obligations is reasonable and necessary\nto accomplishing that purpose). We find no substantive difference\nbetween these differing characterizations of the Contract Clause\nanalysis.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpurpose.5     We find that the plaintiffs did not plead sufficient\n\nfacts regarding this question to survive a Rule (12)(b)(6) motion.\n\nA.           The Plaintiffs' Burden of Establishing               that     the\n             Impairment Was Unreasonable or Unnecessary\n\n             We   first   address   which   party   bears   the   burden    of\n\nestablishing the second prong.        Although neither party must prove\n\nanything at this stage of the litigation, determining who bears the\n\nburden of proof informs the inquiry into whether the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint was appropriately dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).                 See\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (\"[A] complaint must contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that\n\nis plausible on its face.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n             At the outset, we note that there is a real question as\n\nto whether the plaintiffs waived their argument that the defendants\n\nbear this burden by failing to raise that argument to the district\n\ncourt.      However, it is not necessary to resolve this question\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In addition to their arguments on the merits of the\nplaintiffs' claims, the defendants advance three immunity defenses.\nSpecifically, they assert that the defendants \"sued in their\nindividual capacities . . . are entitled to qualified immunity\";\nthe defendants sued in their official capacities for damages are\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and \"Governor Fortuño is\nentitled to legislative immunity . . . .\" Because we find that the\nplaintiffs have not alleged a plausible Contract Clause claim, see\ninfra, we need not reach these arguments. Cf. Parella, 173 F.3d at\n56-57 (concluding that, unlike with Article III jurisdiction\nissues, Eleventh Amendment immunity questions may be avoided where\nthe case can be decided on other grounds).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fbecause we are able to decide the burden issue on the merits.6\n\nThat is, we hold that where plaintiffs sue a state — or in this\n\ncase the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico — challenging the state's\n\nimpairment of a contract to which it is a party, the plaintiffs\n\nbear the burden on the reasonable/necessary prong of the Contract\n\nClause analysis.7\n\n          To begin with, the Supreme Court's formulation of the\n\ncontours of a Contract Clause claim supports allocating this burden\n\nto the plaintiff.    Specifically, we read U.S. Trust as holding\n\nthat, even in the self-interested public contract context, a\n\nsubstantial impairment does not, on its own, amount to a Contract\n\nClause violation.   See 431 U.S. at 17-32 (discussing and analyzing\n\nwhether the impairment at issue was substantial and whether it was\n\nreasonable and necessary to further a government purpose). Rather,\n\n\n     6\n      The plaintiffs claim that the defendants rely on their waiver\ntheory and do not alternatively argue on the merits that this\nburden should be allocated to the plaintiffs. We are not, however,\nbound by the appellee's arguments, as we may affirm a district\ncourt's decision on any ground supported by the record.         See\nRuiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n2007); Webber v. Int'l Paper Co., 417 F.3d 229, 234 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n     7\n      Litigants may invoke the Contract Clause in a variety of\ncontexts. One circuit has suggested that the context and posture\nin which the Contract Clause is invoked will dictate who bears the\nburden of showing reasonableness and necessity, or a lack thereof.\nSee Seltzer v. Cochrane, 104 F.3d 234, 236 (9th Cir. 1996) (\"The\nburden is placed on the party asserting the benefit of the statute\nonly when that party is the state.\" (emphasis added)); Univ. of\nHaw. Prof'l Assembly v. Cayetano, 183 F.3d 1096, 1106 (9th Cir.\n1999) (same). We only address which party bears this burden in the\nspecific context and procedural posture presented in this appeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe state action must also lack an important governmental purpose,\n\nor be unnecessary to or an unreasonable means of effectuating such\n\na purpose.     In other words, there are two essential elements of a\n\nContract Clause claim: (1) substantial impairment and (2) lack of\n\nreasonableness or necessity to an important governmental purpose.\n\nIt therefore stands to reason that both must be pled by plaintiffs\n\nseeking to invalidate a state action.\n\n             The fact that the Contract Clause has traditionally been\n\ninterpreted     to   avoid   limiting   a   state's   ability   to   govern\n\neffectively also weighs in favor of assigning this burden to the\n\nplaintiffs.8     To demand that the state prove reasonableness and\n\nnecessity would force governments to endure costly discovery each\n\ntime a plaintiff advances a plausible allegation of a substantial\n\nimpairment, even where that plaintiff cannot allege a single fact\n\nto question the reasonableness or necessity of the impairment.\n\nThis would not only financially burden states, it would likely\n\ndiscourage legislative action impacting public contracts.            Such a\n\n\n\n     8\n         For example, this court has explained that\n\n             courts have interpreted the clause so as to\n             harmonize the state's need to legislate in the\n             interests of its citizens with the need to\n             protect   investors  and   other   contracting\n             parties against repudiation of a debt or\n             obligation. In doing so, at least since the\n             early 1930's, they have struck down state laws\n             only infrequently.\n\nLocal Div. 589, 666 F.2d at 639.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fresult is particularly undesirable in today's fiscal environment,\n\nwhere       many    states   face   daunting   budget     deficits   that     may\n\nnecessitate decisive and dramatic action.               Cf. Home Bldg. & Loan\n\nAss'n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 443-44 (1934) (\"[T]he court has\n\nsought to prevent the perversion of the clause through its use as\n\nan instrument to throttle the capacity of the states to protect\n\ntheir fundamental interests. This development is a growth from the\n\nseeds which the fathers planted.\").\n\n              To be sure, \"because 'the State's self-interest is at\n\nstake[,]'\"         U.S. Trust, 431 U.S. at 26, less deference is afforded\n\nto a state's decision to alter its own contractual obligations.\n\nSee, e.g., Parella, 173 F.3d at 59; Parker v. Wakelin, 123 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 1997).        Saddling a plaintiff with the burden of proving\n\na lack of reasonableness or necessity is in some tension with the\n\nSupreme       Court's    instruction   that    \"complete     deference   to    a\n\nlegislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not\n\nappropriate . . . .\"          See U.S. Trust, 431 U.S. at 26; see also\n\nMcGrath v. R.I. Ret. Bd., 88 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[A]\n\nstate must do more than mouth the vocabulary of the public weal in\n\norder to reach safe harbor . . . .\").              Not surprisingly, many\n\ncourts have concluded that this burden rests with the state,9 and\n\n\n        9\n      See, e.g., S. Cal. Gas Co. v.

Although a state action impairing its own contracts\n\nis viewed less deferentially compared to a state action impairing\n\nprivate contracts, \"less deference does not imply no deference.\"\n\nBuffalo Teachers Fed'n, 464 F.3d at 370; see also U.S. Trust, 431\n\nU.S. at 26 (\"[C]omplete deference to a legislative assessment of\n\n\n     11\n      Buffalo Teachers Federation articulated the Contract Clause\nanalysis as having three parts: (1) substantial impairment, (2)\nlegitimate public purpose, and (3) impairment reasonable and\nnecessary to serve that public purpose. The plaintiffs assert that\nBuffalo Teachers Federation only held that plaintiffs bear the\nburden on the second question of whether the action had a\nlegitimate purpose. As suggested above, however, see supra note 4,\nthe legitimate public purpose question is folded into the\nreasonable and necessary inquiry in the two-pronged analysis.\nMoreover, requiring plaintiffs to prove that \"the state's\nself-interest rather than the general welfare . . . motivated the\nstate's conduct\" is logically irreconcilable with requiring the\nstate to prove that its action was reasonable and necessary to\neffectuate an important governmental purpose.\n\n     The plaintiffs further attempt to distinguish the case at hand\nfrom Buffalo Teachers Federation by noting that in Buffalo Teachers\nFederation the state impaired a municipality's contractual\nobligations, not its own. Although Buffalo Teachers Federation did\npertain to the impairment of a municipal contract, the court, \"for\nthe purposes of this appeal,\" afforded the challenged impairment\nthe same level of deference it would have afforded an impairment of\na contract to which the state was a party. 464 F.3d at 370.\n\n                                  -14-\n\freasonableness and necessity is not appropriate . . . .\" (emphasis\n\nadded)).     This maxim is particularly true in the Contract Clause\n\ncontext    because    the   heightened     deference     afforded     to     private\n\ncontractual impairments is quite substantial.12               It therefore comes\n\nas   no    surprise   that,     even   when    the    state   impairs       its   own\n\ncontractual obligations, the state's judgment that the impairment\n\nwas justified is afforded meaningful deference.                  See Local Div.\n\n589, 666 F.2d at 643 (\"[W]here economic or social legislation is at\n\nissue, some deference to the legislature's judgment is surely\n\ncalled     for.\");    Buffalo    Teachers      Fed'n,   464    F.3d    at    370-71\n\n(describing the deference owed to legislative judgments even where\n\nthey impair public contractual obligations); Baltimore Teachers\n\nUnion, Am.

Accordingly, the fact that public contract impairment\n\nis subject to a more searching inquiry hardly demands allocating\n\nthe burden of proof to the defendants.\n\n           Nor       would     allocating     this    burden        to   plaintiffs\n\nsubstantially        inhibit     meritorious      Contract         Clause   claims.\n\n\"[B]ecause the record of what and why the state has acted is laid\n\nout in committee hearings, public reports, and legislation,\" it is\n\nnot difficult to discern the state's motivation.

Ct. at 1949.\n\n              As this court has explained, the reasonableness inquiry\n\nasks whether \"the law is 'reasonable in light of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances,'\" and the necessity inquiry focuses on \"whether\n\n[Puerto Rico] 'impose[d] a drastic impairment when an evident and\n\nmore moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.'\"\n\nMercado-Boneta, 125 F.3d at 15 (quoting U.S. Trust, 431 U.S. at\n\n31.).        Some factors to consider in analyzing these questions\n\n\n        13\n      The plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly\n\"relied extensively on the bare assertions contained in the\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to make factual findings regarding\nthe extent of Puerto Rico's structural deficit and the\nappropriateness of Law 7 to address that deficit . . . .\" We are\nnot persuaded that this is an accurate characterization of the\ndistrict court's opinion. Regardless, we need not address this\nargument because we affirm the district court by looking only to\nthe complaint and the assertions and provisions included in Act No.\n7 itself. See Trans-Spec Truck Serv., 524 F.3d at 320 (noting that\na court may consider documents incorporated in the complaint, as\nwell as those which the complaint is dependent upon); Ruiz, 496\nF.3d at 5 (\"[W]e are not bound by the district court's decisional\ncalculus but, rather, may affirm the decision below on any ground\nmade manifest by the record.\").\n\n                                    -17-\n\finclude: \"whether the act (1) was an emergency measure; (2) was one\n\nto protect a basic societal interest, rather than particular\n\nindividuals; (3) was tailored appropriately to its purpose; (4)\n\nimposed reasonable conditions; and (5) was limited to the duration\n\nof the emergency.\"     See Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 410 n.11\n\n(citing Blaisdell, 290 U.S. at 444-47); see also Spannaus, 438 U.S.\n\nat 242-50.\n\n           The reliance interests of the party whose contractual\n\nrights are impaired are of course also a relevant consideration.\n\nSee Baltimore Teachers Union, 6 F.3d at 1021.                Because public\n\nemployees \"by definition serve the public and their expectations\n\nare   necessarily     defined,   at    least    in   part,   by   the   public\n\ninterest[,]\" they, like private parties in a highly regulated\n\nindustry, have a diminished expectation that their contracts will\n\nnot be impaired by the government.            Id. (\"It should not be wholly\n\nunexpected, therefore, that these public servants might well be\n\ncalled upon to sacrifice first when the public interest demands\n\nsacrifice.\").\n\n           The plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts from\n\nwhich a court could reasonably infer that Act No. 7 was unnecessary\n\nor    unreasonable.    To   begin     with,    the   plaintiffs   failed    to\n\nsufficiently describe the contractual provisions allegedly impaired\n\nby Act No. 7, and they therefore failed to demonstrate the extent\n\nof those impairments. The most specific description of Act No. 7's\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\falterations   of   the   plaintiffs'    contractual   rights   was   the\n\nallegation that it:\n\n          substantially impaired all statutory covenants\n          and contractual obligations included in the\n          extant [CBAs] between the exclusive bargaining\n          representatives and the government agencies\n          related to, inter alia, promotions, demotions,\n          transfers; retention and lay-offs; reduction\n          in work force and any requirement prior to\n          order a reduction in force; reinstatement and\n          registry    of    illegibility;   any    cross\n          utilization, prohibition to use employees from\n          another appropriate units; any prohibition to\n          consolidate      job     duties    and     job\n          classifications; any limitation to management\n          rights; any disposition that the agency has to\n          comply with contract obligations in conflict\n          with Act No. 7; seniority . . . dispute\n          resolution process, reviews and appeals . . .\n          .\n\nMerely listing the subject matter covered by the contractual\n\nprovisions at issue is of little help. Rather, determining the\n\nextent to which Act No. 7 undermined the plaintiffs' contractual\n\nexpectations requires knowing what precisely the CBAs promised\n\nconcerning promotions, demotions, transfers, layoffs, etc.           Even\n\nthough we assume arguendo that there was an impairment, and that\n\nthe impairment was substantial, ascertaining the severity of the\n\nimpairment is still a critical inquiry in determining whether a\n\nstate action is a reasonable means of advancing a public purpose.\n\nSee Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 411 (\"The severity of the\n\nimpairment is said to increase the level of scrutiny to which the\n\nlegislation will be subjected.\").\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          The plaintiffs also failed to plead any factual content\n\nto undermine the credibility of Act No. 7's statement that it was\n\nenacted to remedy a $3.2 billion deficit.    The complaint alleges\n\nnothing, other than the conclusory statement that \"the averred\n\npurpose is neither significant nor legitimate,\" to question the\n\nexistence of the deficit or the \"basic societal interest\" in\n\neliminating it.\n\n          Nor does the complaint aver facts demonstrating that Act\n\nNo. 7 was an excessively drastic means of tackling the deficit.    In\n\nfact, almost everything in the complaint challenging Act No. 7's\n\nreasonableness and necessity is a conclusory statement.           For\n\ninstance, the complaint averred that \"there were other available\n\nalternatives with lesser impact to the paramount constitutional\n\nrights affected,\" but failed to specify any such alternatives or\n\nplead any factual content suggesting such alternatives might exist.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not, for example, claim that the legislature\n\nrefused to consider alternative approaches.14   See U.S. Trust, 431\n\nU.S. at 30-31 (\"[A] State is not completely free to consider\n\nimpairing the obligations of its own contracts on a par with other\n\npolicy alternatives.\").   To be sure, the plaintiffs assert that\n\nPuerto Rico should have used federal aid to help offset the\n\n\n\n     14\n      In fact, the legislature actually included non-contract-\nimpairing provisions in Act No. 7, such as the numerous new taxes,\nwhich the complaint does not suggest were superficial or otherwise\ninsignificant to the overall legislative effort.\n\n                               -20-\n\fdeficit. They did not, however, allege anything about this federal\n\nsupport in their complaint, let alone explain how such assistance\n\nwould alleviate a $3.2 billion deficit to such an extent as to\n\nrender Act No. 7's contractual impairments unnecessary.\n\n           Admittedly, the complaint includes the non-conclusory\n\nobservation that the two-year suspension of contractual rights is\n\nparticularly substantial \"considering the life of all [CBAs] can\n\nonly extend to three years.\" Although this allegation is probative\n\nof an insufficiently tailored remedy, it is not, on its own, enough\n\nto create a plausible argument that Act No. 7 was unreasonable or\n\nunnecessary.\n\n           Finally, no facts have been pled to suggest that Act No.\n\n7 was enacted to benefit a special interest at the expense of\n\nPuerto Rico's public employees.       To the contrary, Act No. 7, on its\n\nface, appears to spread the burden of restoring Puerto Rico's\n\nfiscal   health   across   various    sectors   of   society   by   enacting\n\nnumerous new tax measures impacting a range of people and entities.\n\n           In sum, the complaint did not show how Act No. 7 was\n\n\"'[un]reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances'\" or\n\n\"'impose[d] a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate\n\ncourse would serve its purposes equally well.'\"                See Mercado-\n\nBoneta, 125 F.3d at 15 (quoting U.S. Trust, 431 U.S. at 31).\n\nConsequently, the plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to\n\n\"allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fdefendant[s] [are] liable\" for violating the Contract Clause.\n\nBecause the plaintiffs' appeal of the district court's refusal to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over their Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims relies on the reinstatement of the federal Contract Clause\n\nclaim, we also affirm the district court on the supplemental\n\njurisdiction issue.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                 - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                              -22-\n\f              BOUDIN and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, concurring.                        Good\n\narguments exist for placing the burden of proof as to whether the\n\nmeasure is justified on the plaintiff, even in a case where a self-\n\ninterested government entity is the beneficiary as well as the\n\nimpairer of the contract.              This is the customary rule in cases\n\nwhere the government impairs a private contract but does not itself\n\nbenefit, e.g., Seltzer v. Cochrane, 104 F.3d 234, 236 (9th Cir.\n\n1996);     the    unreasonableness           of    the     impairment,     like     the\n\nsubstantiality of the impairment, can be said to be an element of\n\nthe claim, see U.S. Trust Co. of N.Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1,\n\n25-26 (1977); and the substantive test of justification vel non is\n\nalready adjusted in the plaintiff's favor, see McGrath v. R.I. Ret.\n\nBd., 88 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              Further, in a proof-shifting role, the burden is unlikely\n\nto   matter    very    much    in    most    Contract     Clause   cases,15   so    the\n\nallocation of the burden to a plaintiff serves primarily as a\n\npleading      device   to     make   the    plaintiff      focus   its    claim.     In\n\npractice, the government's rationale for the impairment is usually\n\nobvious (and the government usually prevails); the mystery at the\n\ncomplaint      stage    is     likely       to     be    the   peculiar     claim    of\n\n\n      15\n      Arguments about justification and unreasonableness are often\ngoing to turn on a combination of legislative history and\nlegislative fact based on available material. See Buffalo Teachers\nFed'n v. Tobe, 464 F.3d 362, 365 (2d Cir. 2006). In practice, when\nthe issue is joined, the government will tend to assert facts that\nshow reasonableness, and the plaintiff will tend to assert those\nthat point in the opposite direction.\n\n                                            -23-\n\funreasonableness that the plaintiff plans to invoke.     Knowing this\n\n(and the facts claimed to support it) at the outset means that a\n\njudgment can be made early on as to whether to go beyond the\n\ncomplaint stage.\n\n           Indeed, since 1934, the Supreme Court has only once--in\n\nU.S. Trust Co.--struck down a state law that interfered with a\n\ngovernment contract on Contract Clause grounds.       E. Chemerinsky,\n\nConstitutional Law 630, 639 (3d ed. 2006).     As then-Judge Breyer\n\nwrote for this court:\n\n          The Contract Clause does not make unlawful\n          every state law that conflicts with any\n          contract that contains terms contrary to its\n          provisions.     Any such interpretation would\n          make of the clause an insuperable barrier to\n          necessary state legislation.           It would\n          threaten     to     make     the    Constitution\n          unworkable. . . .        Thus, the courts have\n          interpreted the clause so as to harmonize the\n          state's need to legislate in the interests of\n          its citizens with the need to protect\n          investors   and    other   contracting   parties\n          against repudiation of a debt or obligation.\n          In doing so, at least since the early 1930's,\n          they have struck down state laws only\n          infrequently.\n\nLocal Div. 589, Amalgamated Transit Union v. Massachusetts, 666\n\nF.2d 618, 638-39 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          One reason why plaintiff victories are rare is that\n\ncourts are not in a good position to determine the unreasonableness\n\nof the impairment unless it is particularly severe.    See id. at 643\n\n(\"Answering these sorts of questions, and thereby determining the\n\n'reasonableness and necessity' of a particular statute is a task\n\n                               -24-\n\ffar better suited to legislators than to judges.\").      Thus, before\n\nburdensome discovery is imposed and further court time consumed, as\n\na prudential matter it is quite desirable that the complaint plead\n\nwith some specificity facts showing why the ordinary outcome is not\n\nappropriate.\n\n          Still, the issue is unsettled.       Some language in U.S.\n\nTrust Co. blurs the issue, see 431 U.S. at 31 (\"In the instant case\n\nthe State has failed to demonstrate that repeal of the 1962\n\ncovenant was similarly necessary.\"), and some case law in other\n\ncircuits assists the plaintiffs.16      No one short of the Supreme\n\nCourt is capable of definitively resolving a problem that may well\n\nhave considerable importance in light of the current financial\n\ndifficulties   confronting   state   governments.   So   we   write   to\n\nemphasize that the outcome of this case need not turn on definitive\n\nresolution of the burden issue.\n\n          This is so because the plaintiffs told the district court\n\nin writing that the burden of proof as to justification lay on\n\nthem; specifically, they wrote:\n\n          [T]he Plaintiffs have to show that the\n          contractual  impairments were  not  \"both\n          reasonable and necessary to fulfill an\n          important public purpose.\"    Seltzer v.\n\n\n\n     16\n      Compare Univ. of Haw.

See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937,\n\n1949-50 (2009).\n\n            Although the plaintiffs say that placing the burden on\n\nthemselves was the result of a typographical error--the inadvertent\n\nsubstitution of the word \"plaintiffs\" for the word \"defendants\" and\n\naddition of the word \"not\"--and that the cited case looked in the\n\nopposite direction, a busy district judge is entitled to accept an\n\nexpress concession, see Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 29 n.8\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).           Because the plaintiffs conceded away their\n\nargument on the burden of proof issue, we would (even if we agreed\n\nwith their new position) review the district court's decision only\n\nfor plain error, see Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178 F.3d\n\n8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            In civil cases, it is very difficult to show, as is\n\nrequired by Supreme Court precedent on plain error review, United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993), a miscarriage of justice\n\nor something close to it.         Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18,\n\n20   (1st   Cir.   2002)    (en   banc)   (per    curiam).      Certainly,   the\n\nplaintiffs have not made that showing here.              Puerto Rico has been\n\n                                      -26-\n\fsuffering from one of the worst financial crises in its history,\n\nits government has been running a large structural deficit, and its\n\ncredit has been in jeopardy.17\n\n             Conversely, the plaintiffs do not deny Puerto Rico's\n\nfinancial   plight,   that   employee   compensation   is   a   principal\n\nexpenditure,18 or that revenue raising as well as cost cutting was\n\npart of the package. True, the plaintiffs have offered criticisms,\n\nsaying, for example, that some of the positions being eliminated\n\nwere federally funded; but, given federal budget problems, how long\n\nthis might continue could hardly be certain.       Whether or not the\n\nstatute could have been fine tuned, it is hard to see a miscarriage\n\nof justice that would invite plain error review.\n\n            Accordingly, the outcome of this case would be the same\n\neven if, contrary to the panel decision, the government bore the\n\nburden of proof on the justification issue. The plaintiffs assumed\n\nthat burden themselves, did not in the complaint allege facts to\n\nsatisfy it, and cannot satisfy the requirements for plain error\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n     17\n      2009 P.R.

Act No. 45 also established\n\nprocedures       for   resolving   impasses     in    collective     bargaining\n\nnegotiations, and for addressing disputes arising under the CBAs.\n\nSee id. et seq.        By the time the plaintiffs filed this suit, fifty\n\nPuerto Rico government agencies had negotiated CBAs covering over\n\n50,000 public employees.\n\n               On March 9, 2009, Governor Fortuño signed Act No. 7 —\n\nentitled      the   \"Law   Declaring   a   Fiscal    State   of   Emergency   and\n\nEstablishing a Comprehensive Fiscal Stabilization Plan to Save\n\nPuerto Rico Credit\" — into law.1             See 2009 P.R. Laws Act No. 7.\n\nAccording to the \"Public Policy Statement of Purpose\" included in\n\nthe bill, Act No. 7 was intended to eliminate Puerto Rico's $3.2\n\nbillion structural deficit.        Id. ch. I, § 2.\n\n               As a cost-saving measure purportedly aimed at addressing\n\nthis deficit, Act No. 7 laid out a three-phase plan to reduce the\n\ngovernment payroll.

Id. ch. III, § 36.   Phase II authorized\n\ninvoluntary, seniority-based layoffs upon a determination that\n\nPhase I had failed to create the necessary savings on its own.   Id.\n\nch. III, § 37.    Although various categories of employees were\n\nexempted, if Phase II was to be implemented it could result in as\n\nmany as 40,000 layoffs.   Finally, Phase III temporarily suspended,\n\nfor a period of two years, a plethora of statutory, contractual,\n\nand other provisions governing the conditions of employment for the\n\nremaining affected public employees.     Id. ch. III, § 38.      This\n\nphase effectively froze salaries and suspended other benefits and\n\nprotections within the CBAs.\n\n          The complaint characterized Act No. 7's impact as\n\n          substantially    impair[ing]   all   statutory\n          covenants and contractual obligations included\n          in the extant [CBAs] between the exclusive\n          bargaining representatives and the government\n          agencies related to, inter alia, promotions,\n          demotions, transfers; retention and lay-offs;\n          reduction in work force and any requirement\n          prior   to   order   a  reduction  in   force;\n          reinstatement and registry of illegibility;\n          any cross utilization, prohibition to use\n          employees from another appropriate units; any\n          prohibition to consolidate job duties and job\n          classifications; any limitation to management\n          rights; any disposition that the agency has to\n          comply with contract obligations in conflict\n          with Act No. 7; seniority, if in conflict with\n          Act No. 7; dispute resolution process, reviews\n          and appeals if in conflict with Act No. 7.\n\n          Act No. 7 did not, however, rely solely on cost-cutting\n\nmeasures to address Puerto Rico's deficit, but also included\n\n                                -4-\n\frevenue increases.      To name just a few examples, Act No. 7\n\neliminated various tax credits and exemptions; increased the excise\n\ntax on cigarettes and certain alcoholic beverages; levied new taxes\n\non certain banks and insurers; and added a residential property\n\ntax.   2009 P.R.

With respect to the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fContract Clause claim on appeal, the district court held that the\n\nplaintiffs       failed   to   sufficiently   allege   that   Act   No.   7's\n\nimpairments of the CBAs were unreasonable or unnecessary to an\n\nimportant government interest, and it therefore rejected the claim\n\nthat those impairments ran afoul of the Contract Clause.2\n\n                                II.

However, it is not necessary to resolve this question\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In addition to their arguments on the merits of the\nplaintiffs' claims, the defendants advance three immunity defenses.\nSpecifically, they assert that the defendants \"sued in their\nindividual capacities . . . are entitled to qualified immunity\";\nthe defendants sued in their official capacities for damages are\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; and \"Governor Fortuño is\nentitled to legislative immunity . . . .\" Because we find that the\nplaintiffs have not alleged a plausible Contract Clause claim, see\ninfra, we need not reach these arguments.

Parella, 173 F.3d at\n56-57 (concluding that, unlike with Article III jurisdiction\nissues, Eleventh Amendment immunity questions may be avoided where\nthe case can be decided on other grounds).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fbecause we are able to decide the burden issue on the merits.6\n\nThat is, we hold that where plaintiffs sue a state — or in this\n\ncase the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico — challenging the state's\n\nimpairment of a contract to which it is a party, the plaintiffs\n\nbear the burden on the reasonable/necessary prong of the Contract\n\nClause analysis.7\n\n          To begin with, the Supreme Court's formulation of the\n\ncontours of a Contract Clause claim supports allocating this burden\n\nto the plaintiff.    Specifically, we read U.S. Trust as holding\n\nthat, even in the self-interested public contract context, a\n\nsubstantial impairment does not, on its own, amount to a Contract\n\nClause violation.   See 431 U.S. at 17-32 (discussing and analyzing\n\nwhether the impairment at issue was substantial and whether it was\n\nreasonable and necessary to further a government purpose). Rather,\n\n\n     6\n      The plaintiffs claim that the defendants rely on their waiver\ntheory and do not alternatively argue on the merits that this\nburden should be allocated to the plaintiffs. We are not, however,\nbound by the appellee's arguments, as we may affirm a district\ncourt's decision on any ground supported by the record.         See\nRuiz v.

As suggested above, however, see supra note 4,\nthe legitimate public purpose question is folded into the\nreasonable and necessary inquiry in the two-pronged analysis.\nMoreover, requiring plaintiffs to prove that \"the state's\nself-interest rather than the general welfare . . . motivated the\nstate's conduct\" is logically irreconcilable with requiring the\nstate to prove that its action was reasonable and necessary to\neffectuate an important governmental purpose.\n\n     The plaintiffs further attempt to distinguish the case at hand\nfrom Buffalo Teachers Federation by noting that in Buffalo Teachers\nFederation the state impaired a municipality's contractual\nobligations, not its own. Although Buffalo Teachers Federation did\npertain to the impairment of a municipal contract, the court, \"for\nthe purposes of this appeal,\" afforded the challenged impairment\nthe same level of deference it would have afforded an impairment of\na contract to which the state was a party. 464 F.3d at 370.\n\n                                  -14-\n\freasonableness and necessity is not appropriate . . . .\" (emphasis\n\nadded)).

Rather, determining the\n\nextent to which Act No. 7 undermined the plaintiffs' contractual\n\nexpectations requires knowing what precisely the CBAs promised\n\nconcerning promotions, demotions, transfers, layoffs, etc.           Even\n\nthough we assume arguendo that there was an impairment, and that\n\nthe impairment was substantial, ascertaining the severity of the\n\nimpairment is still a critical inquiry in determining whether a\n\nstate action is a reasonable means of advancing a public purpose.\n\nSee Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 411 (\"The severity of the\n\nimpairment is said to increase the level of scrutiny to which the\n\nlegislation will be subjected.\").\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          The plaintiffs also failed to plead any factual content\n\nto undermine the credibility of Act No. 7's statement that it was\n\nenacted to remedy a $3.2 billion deficit.    The complaint alleges\n\nnothing, other than the conclusory statement that \"the averred\n\npurpose is neither significant nor legitimate,\" to question the\n\nexistence of the deficit or the \"basic societal interest\" in\n\neliminating it.\n\n          Nor does the complaint aver facts demonstrating that Act\n\nNo. 7 was an excessively drastic means of tackling the deficit.    In\n\nfact, almost everything in the complaint challenging Act No. 7's\n\nreasonableness and necessity is a conclusory statement.           For\n\ninstance, the complaint averred that \"there were other available\n\nalternatives with lesser impact to the paramount constitutional\n\nrights affected,\" but failed to specify any such alternatives or\n\nplead any factual content suggesting such alternatives might exist.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not, for example, claim that the legislature\n\nrefused to consider alternative approaches.14   See U.S. Trust, 431\n\nU.S. at 30-31 (\"[A] State is not completely free to consider\n\nimpairing the obligations of its own contracts on a par with other\n\npolicy alternatives.\").   To be sure, the plaintiffs assert that\n\nPuerto Rico should have used federal aid to help offset the\n\n\n\n     14\n      In fact, the legislature actually included non-contract-\nimpairing provisions in Act No. 7, such as the numerous new taxes,\nwhich the complaint does not suggest were superficial or otherwise\ninsignificant to the overall legislative effort.\n\n                               -20-\n\fdeficit. They did not, however, allege anything about this federal\n\nsupport in their complaint, let alone explain how such assistance\n\nwould alleviate a $3.2 billion deficit to such an extent as to\n\nrender Act No. 7's contractual impairments unnecessary.\n\n           Admittedly, the complaint includes the non-conclusory\n\nobservation that the two-year suspension of contractual rights is\n\nparticularly substantial \"considering the life of all [CBAs] can\n\nonly extend to three years.\" Although this allegation is probative\n\nof an insufficiently tailored remedy, it is not, on its own, enough\n\nto create a plausible argument that Act No. 7 was unreasonable or\n\nunnecessary.\n\n           Finally, no facts have been pled to suggest that Act No.\n\n7 was enacted to benefit a special interest at the expense of\n\nPuerto Rico's public employees.       To the contrary, Act No. 7, on its\n\nface, appears to spread the burden of restoring Puerto Rico's\n\nfiscal   health   across   various    sectors   of   society   by   enacting\n\nnumerous new tax measures impacting a range of people and entities.\n\n           In sum, the complaint did not show how Act No. 7 was\n\n\"'[un]reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances'\" or\n\n\"'impose[d] a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate\n\ncourse would serve its purposes equally well.'\"                See Mercado-\n\nBoneta, 125 F.3d at 15 (quoting U.S. Trust, 431 U.S. at 31).\n\nConsequently, the plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to\n\n\"allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fdefendant[s] [are] liable\" for violating the Contract Clause.\n\nBecause the plaintiffs' appeal of the district court's refusal to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over their Puerto Rico law\n\nclaims relies on the reinstatement of the federal Contract Clause\n\nclaim, we also affirm the district court on the supplemental\n\njurisdiction issue.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                 - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                              -22-\n\f              BOUDIN and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, concurring.                        Good\n\narguments exist for placing the burden of proof as to whether the\n\nmeasure is justified on the plaintiff, even in a case where a self-\n\ninterested government entity is the beneficiary as well as the\n\nimpairer of the contract.              This is the customary rule in cases\n\nwhere the government impairs a private contract but does not itself\n\nbenefit, e.g., Seltzer v. Cochrane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732512\"><a href=\"/opinion/732512/in-re-kenneth-a-seltzer-dba-signs-now-sharon-seltzer-debtors-kenneth-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (9th Cir.\n\n1996);     the    unreasonableness           of    the     impairment,     like     the\n\nsubstantiality of the impairment, can be said to be an element of\n\nthe claim, see U.S. Trust Co. of N.Y. v.

In\n\npractice, the government's rationale for the impairment is usually\n\nobvious (and the government usually prevails); the mystery at the\n\ncomplaint      stage    is     likely       to     be    the   peculiar     claim    of\n\n\n      15\n      Arguments about justification and unreasonableness are often\ngoing to turn on a combination of legislative history and\nlegislative fact based on available material. See Buffalo Teachers\nFed'n v. Tobe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795813\"><a href=\"/opinion/795813/buffalo-teachers-federation-buffalo-educational-support-team-neany/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (2d Cir. 2006). In practice, when\nthe issue is joined, the government will tend to assert facts that\nshow reasonableness, and the plaintiff will tend to assert those\nthat point in the opposite direction.\n\n                                            -23-\n\funreasonableness that the plaintiff plans to invoke.     Knowing this\n\n(and the facts claimed to support it) at the outset means that a\n\njudgment can be made early on as to whether to go beyond the\n\ncomplaint stage.\n\n           Indeed, since 1934, the Supreme Court has only once--in\n\nU.S. Trust Co.--struck down a state law that interfered with a\n\ngovernment contract on Contract Clause grounds.       E. Chemerinsky,\n\nConstitutional Law 630, 639 (3d ed. 2006).     As then-Judge Breyer\n\nwrote for this court:\n\n          The Contract Clause does not make unlawful\n          every state law that conflicts with any\n          contract that contains terms contrary to its\n          provisions.     Any such interpretation would\n          make of the clause an insuperable barrier to\n          necessary state legislation.           It would\n          threaten     to     make     the    Constitution\n          unworkable. . . .        Thus, the courts have\n          interpreted the clause so as to harmonize the\n          state's need to legislate in the interests of\n          its citizens with the need to protect\n          investors   and    other   contracting   parties\n          against repudiation of a debt or obligation.\n          In doing so, at least since the early 1930's,\n          they have struck down state laws only\n          infrequently.\n\nLocal Div. 589, Amalgamated Transit Union v. Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398005\"><a href=\"/opinion/398005/local-division-589-amalgamated-transit-union-afl-cio-clc-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638-39 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          One reason why plaintiff victories are rare is that\n\ncourts are not in a good position to determine the unreasonableness\n\nof the impairment unless it is particularly severe.    See id. at 643\n\n(\"Answering these sorts of questions, and thereby determining the\n\n'reasonableness and necessity' of a particular statute is a task\n\n                               -24-\n\ffar better suited to legislators than to judges.\").      Thus, before\n\nburdensome discovery is imposed and further court time consumed, as\n\na prudential matter it is quite desirable that the complaint plead\n\nwith some specificity facts showing why the ordinary outcome is not\n\nappropriate.\n\n          Still, the issue is unsettled.       Some language in U.S.\n\nTrust Co. blurs the issue, see 431 U.S. at 31 (\"In the instant case\n\nthe State has failed to demonstrate that repeal of the 1962\n\ncovenant was similarly necessary.\"), and some case law in other\n\ncircuits assists the plaintiffs.16      No one short of the Supreme\n\nCourt is capable of definitively resolving a problem that may well\n\nhave considerable importance in light of the current financial\n\ndifficulties   confronting   state   governments.   So   we   write   to\n\nemphasize that the outcome of this case need not turn on definitive\n\nresolution of the burden issue.\n\n          This is so because the plaintiffs told the district court\n\nin writing that the burden of proof as to justification lay on\n\nthem; specifically, they wrote:\n\n          [T]he Plaintiffs have to show that the\n          contractual  impairments were  not  \"both\n          reasonable and necessary to fulfill an\n          important public purpose.\"    Seltzer v.\n\n\n\n     16\n      Compare Univ. of Haw.
