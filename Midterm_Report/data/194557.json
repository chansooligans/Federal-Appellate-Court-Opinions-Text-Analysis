Pro  se   plaintiff-appellant  Cok\n                                \n\nappeals from an order remanding to the state court a matter\n\nwhich Cok had  attempted to remove, and from  an injunction\n\npreventing her from removing  any other matters and placing\n\nrestrictions   on   future  filings.      We  are   without\n\njurisdiction  to review  the remand  order, and  vacate the\n\ninjunction.\n\n                     REMOVAL AND REMAND\n                                       \n\n         Cok  was  divorced   in  Rhode  Island  in   1982.\n\nProtracted and acrimonious proceedings in the  Rhode Island\n\nFamily  Court  have  continued to  this  day  and form  the\n\nbackdrop of this appeal.  According to Cok, the divorce and\n\nits  fallout   have  produced  over  600   orders.    Cok's\n\ncontentions, while characterized in terms of preemption and\n\nfederalism,  revolve,  at  bottom,  around  her  continuing\n\nobjections  to family court orders doling  out her money to\n\nvarious persons whom she considers unworthy and corrupt.\n\n         This is  at least  Cok's second attempt  to remove\n\nmatters  devolving  out  of  her  divorce  to  the  federal\n\ndistrict court.  In 1984, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n\naffirmed the divorce decree including various fees awarded.\n\nAfter the  court-appointed guardian  ad litem had  moved in\n\nthe Family Court  of Rhode Island to collect a  fee for his\n\nservices, and the  conservator, on order of  the court, had\n\nattempted  to sell  certain  properties owned  by Cok,  Cok\n\nundertook  to remove the case to the District Court for the\n\nDistrict of  Rhode Island.   Finding the  case unremovable,\n\nthe district court remanded.   We summarily dismissed Cok's\n\nappeal from that order  under the authority of 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1447(d).  Cok v. Cosentino, No. 85-1058, slip op. (1st Cir.\n                          \n\nMay 1, 1985).   Thereafter, in Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d 1\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir. 1989), we affirmed the  dismissal of Cok's civil\n\nrights and RICO complaints against the same court-appointed\n\nguardian  ad  litem  and  conservator  of  marital  assets.\n\nSubsequently, Judge  Suttell of  the Family Court  of Rhode\n\nIsland ordered the payment  of $160,000 to the conservator,\n\nthat amount to be  disbursed from a $200,000 fund  that Cok\n\nwas \"forced\" to deposit with the family court.\n\n         In September 1991, apparently in response to Judge\n\nSuttell's order, Cok attempted this  removal.  The State of\n\nRhode Island  and its  family court appeared  specially and\n\nmoved for summary dismissal or, alternatively,  for remand.\n\nThe matter was referred to a magistrate-judge, who, after a\n\nhearing,  determined  that  the  remand  motion  should  be\n\ngranted.     In  concluding   that  the  matter   had  been\n\nimprovidently removed, the magistrate observed that Cok, in\n\nessence,  sought appellate  review of  a matter  decided by\n\nJudge Suttell, and had \"misconstrued the purpose and proper\n\nuse  of  the  removal statute,  28  U.S.C.     1446.\"   The\n\nmagistrate also found that Cok was attempting to litigate a\n\ndifferent  set of  claims  than those  litigated in  family\n\n                            -3-\n\ncourt and that these new claims could not be  brought via a\n\nremoval  petition.   The district  court upheld  the remand\n\norder and Cok has appealed.1\n\n         This court is  altogether without jurisdiction  to\n\nreview the subject  of this appeal: a  district court order\n\nremanding plaintiff's  case to a Rhode  Island state court.\n\nWe  so held on very  similar facts in Unauthorized Practice\n                                                           \n\nof  Law Committee v. Gordon,  979 F.2d 11  (1st Cir. 1992).\n                           \n\nIn Unauthorized  Practice,  involving, as  here,  a  remand\n                         \n\norder  issued by  a  magistrate-judge and  affirmed by  the\n\ndistrict court, we determined that such an order was immune\n\nfrom  appellate review under 28  U.S.C.   1447(d).   Id. at\n                                                        \n\n13.  The same result applies here.\n\n         Unlike the plaintiff in Unauthorized Practice, Cok\n                                                      \n\nfiled, within the ten  days normally reserved for objecting\n\nto a  magistrate's report  and recommendation, a  motion to\n\nreconsider  the order granting  the motion to  remand.  The\n\ndistrict court held a hearing on the motion, and \"affirmed\"\n\nthe magistrate's remand order.   Nonetheless, as  discussed\n\nin Unauthorized Practice, id. at 13-14, despite   1447(d)'s\n                             \n\nlanguage precluding  review of remand orders  \"on appeal or\n\notherwise\" (emphasis added), whether the district court was\n         \n\n                   \n\n1.  At the  hearing before  the district court  to reconsider\nthe  remand order, Cok withdrew her motion for recusal of the\ndistrict judge, and it  was not acted upon.   Although raised\non appeal, that issue has been waived.\n\n                            -4-\n\nreviewing a final  order of  remand (as appears  to be  the\n\ncase),  or whether it construed the magistrate's order as a\n\nreport and recommendation and Cok's motion to reconsider as\n\nobjections thereto, \"  1447(d)'s prohibition on review of a\n\nremand order dooms [the] appeal here.\"  Id. at 14.\n                                           \n\n                       THE INJUNCTION\n                                     \n\n         At  the hearing  on the  motion to  reconsider the\n\nremand order, the district  court, sua sponte, enjoined Cok\n                                             \n\nfrom  attempting the pro se removal of any matters from the\n                           \n\nfamily court, or from filing any pro se actions in district\n                                       \n\ncourt,  without the prior approval of a judge of the court,\n\nand entered an order to that effect.  It states:\n\n              Plaintiff  is  hereby enjoined  from\n         removing any  matters to this  Court from\n         the  Rhode Island  Family Court,  pro se,\n         and  is also enjoined from commencing any\n         actions  in this  Court, pro  se, without\n         prior approval of a Judge of this Court.\n\nOn appeal  from this  injunctive order, Cok  challenges the\n\npropriety of such an injunction, complaining of the absence\n\nof supporting findings by the district court.2\n\n         Federal   courts  plainly   possess  discretionary\n\npowers  to  regulate  the  conduct  of  abusive  litigants.\n\n                   \n\n2.  In agreement with other circuits that have considered the\nquestion,  we  are satisfied  that  we  have jurisdiction  to\nreview an  order restricting  a pro  se  litigant's right  of\n                                      \naccess even when  no new  filing has, as  yet, been  rejected\nunder the order.  See Moy v. United States, 906 F.2d 467, 470\n                                         \n(9th Cir.  1990) (collecting  cases); Pavilonis v.

United States, 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir. 1985);\n                       \n\nPavilonis  v.

However, the  restrictions\n      \n\nimposed  must  be tailored  to  the specific  circumstances\n\npresented.   Castro, 775 F.2d  at 410 (\"[I]f  an injunction\n                   \n\nagainst  future litigation  were  couched  in overly  broad\n\nterms, this could impermissibly infringe upon a litigator's\n\nright of access to the courts\"); see also Sires v. Gabriel,\n                                                          \n\n748 F.2d 49, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n         To  determine the appropriateness of an injunction\n\nbarring a litigant from bringing without advance permission\n\nany action in the district court, we look to  the degree to\n   \n\nwhich  indicia  supporting  such a  comprehensive  ban  are\n\npresent in  the record.  We have said that the use of broad\n\nfiling restrictions against  pro se  plaintiffs \"should  be\n                                   \n\napproached  with particular caution.\"   Pavilonis, 626 F.2d\n                                                 \n\nat 1079.  We have also required,  like other jurisdictions,\n\nthat in such situations  a sufficiently developed record be\n\npresented for review.  See, e.g., Castro, 775 F.2d at 409 &amp;\n                                        \n\nn.11; see also De Long v. Hennessey, 912 F.2d 1144, 1147-48\n                                   \n\n(9th  Cir.), cert.  denied, 111  S. Ct.  562 (1990);  In re\n                                                           \n\nPowell, 851 F.2d 427, 431 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\n      \n\n         An initial problem with the present  injunction is\n\nthat  Cok was  not  warned or  otherwise given  notice that\n\nfiling  restrictions  were  contemplated.    She  thus  was\n\n                            -6-\n\nwithout an opportunity  to respond  before the  restrictive\n\nfiling  order was entered.  Adequate notice may be informal\n\nbut should  be afforded.   For  example, in  Pavilonis, 626\n                                                      \n\nF.2d at  1077, a  magistrate's report recommended  that the\n\ndistrict court impose filing restrictions and the plaintiff\n\nfiled  objections to that report.   In Castro,  775 F.2d at\n                                             \n\n402,  the defendants  tried to  enjoin the  plaintiffs from\n\nrelitigating matters arising out of the case at hand or any\n\nearlier   litigation   between    the   parties.      Where\n\nrecommendations or  requests like  this do not  come first,\n\ncourts have  issued  show cause  orders  to errant  pro  se\n                                                           \n\nlitigators, Cofield  v.

See, e.g.,\n                                                          \n\nMartin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 113 S. Ct.\n                                               \n\n397, 398 (1992); Ketchum  v. Cruz, 961 F.2d 916,  918 (10th\n                                 \n\nCir. 1992);  Winslow  v. Romer, 759  F.

Here, as  in\n\nSires,  748  F.2d at  51, the  defendants  did not  seek an\n     \n\n                            -7-\n\ninjunction  nor  did  they  maintain  that  they  had  been\n\nharassed by Cok's  conduct.  We think, therefore,  that Cok\n\nshould  have been  given  an opportunity  by  the court  to\n\noppose the entry of so broad an order placing  restrictions\n\non court access.

Injunctions restricting court access across the board\n\nin  all cases are very  much \"the exception  to the general\n\nrule of free access to the courts.\"  Pavilonis, 626 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n1079.   They  should  be  issued  only  when  abuse  is  so\n\ncontinuous  and  widespread  as  to  suggest  no reasonable\n\nalternative.\n\n         We emphasize that it is the breadth of the instant\n\norder  that causes us some  concern.  Had  the court, after\n\nnotice and opportunity to respond, merely enjoined Cok from\n\nfurther frivolous removals from  the family court, we would\n\nhave doubtless approved.   The present record supports such\n\na  limited  order.    We  have  not  hesitated   to  uphold\n\ninjunctions   that  were  narrowly  drawn  to  counter  the\n\n                            -9-\n\nspecific offending conduct.   Castro, 775 F.2d at  410; cf.\n                                                           \n\nPavilonis,   626  F.2d  at   1079  (upholding  issuance  of\n         \n\ninjunction but narrowing its scope).  But this order is not\n\nlimited to  restricting improper conduct of  the type which\n\nthe present record indicates plaintiff has displayed in the\n\npast.  If  the \"specific  vice\" sought to  be curtailed  is\n\nsimply the appellant's  propensity, as here and in 1984, to\n\nattempt improper removals to federal court of matters based\n\non her  state divorce  proceeding, the district  court may,\n\nafter notice, wish to enter an order limiting such conduct.\n\nSee  Castro, 775 F.2d  at 410.   On the other  hand, if the\n           \n\ncourt means to issue a more generalized injunction aimed at\n\npreventing the  bringing of any and all  unpermitted pro se\n                                                           \n\nactions in  the district  court, it  must develop  a record\n\nshowing such widespread abuse of the judicial system  as to\n\nwarrant such a broadcast prohibition.  Id. at 410 n.13.  \n                                          \n\n         We  recognize that  the district  court is  in the\n\nbest  position to  set preconditions  on access and  do not\n\nprescribe  any  particular  design for  such  restraints to\n\ntake.   See Procup v. Strickland, 792 F.2d 1069, 1073 (11th\n                                \n\nCir. 1986) (en banc) (compiling illustrative restrictions);\n\nsee  also Abdul-Akbar v.

We  are also\n              \n\nsympathetic  to  the difficult  task  faced by  a  court in\n\n                            -10-\n\nattempting  to  ensure  that  judicial  resources  are  not\n\nmisused  by abusive  litigants.   The present  litigant has\n\nclearly been acting in an unacceptable manner.

Pro  se   plaintiff-appellant  Cok\n                                \n\nappeals from an order remanding to the state court a matter\n\nwhich Cok had  attempted to remove, and from  an injunction\n\npreventing her from removing  any other matters and placing\n\nrestrictions   on   future  filings.      We  are   without\n\njurisdiction  to review  the remand  order, and  vacate the\n\ninjunction.\n\n                     REMOVAL AND REMAND\n                                       \n\n         Cok  was  divorced   in  Rhode  Island  in   1982.\n\nProtracted and acrimonious proceedings in the  Rhode Island\n\nFamily  Court  have  continued to  this  day  and form  the\n\nbackdrop of this appeal.  According to Cok, the divorce and\n\nits  fallout   have  produced  over  600   orders.    Cok's\n\ncontentions, while characterized in terms of preemption and\n\nfederalism,  revolve,  at  bottom,  around  her  continuing\n\nobjections  to family court orders doling  out her money to\n\nvarious persons whom she considers unworthy and corrupt.\n\n         This is  at least  Cok's second attempt  to remove\n\nmatters  devolving  out  of  her  divorce  to  the  federal\n\ndistrict court.  In 1984, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n\naffirmed the divorce decree including various fees awarded.\n\nAfter the  court-appointed guardian  ad litem had  moved in\n\nthe Family Court  of Rhode Island to collect a  fee for his\n\nservices, and the  conservator, on order of  the court, had\n\nattempted  to sell  certain  properties owned  by Cok,  Cok\n\nundertook  to remove the case to the District Court for the\n\nDistrict of  Rhode Island.   Finding the  case unremovable,\n\nthe district court remanded.   We summarily dismissed Cok's\n\nappeal from that order  under the authority of 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1447(d).  Cok v.

The State of\n\nRhode Island  and its  family court appeared  specially and\n\nmoved for summary dismissal or, alternatively,  for remand.\n\nThe matter was referred to a magistrate-judge, who, after a\n\nhearing,  determined  that  the  remand  motion  should  be\n\ngranted.     In  concluding   that  the  matter   had  been\n\nimprovidently removed, the magistrate observed that Cok, in\n\nessence,  sought appellate  review of  a matter  decided by\n\nJudge Suttell, and had \"misconstrued the purpose and proper\n\nuse  of  the  removal statute,  28  U.S.C.     1446.\"   The\n\nmagistrate also found that Cok was attempting to litigate a\n\ndifferent  set of  claims  than those  litigated in  family\n\n                            -3-\n\ncourt and that these new claims could not be  brought via a\n\nremoval  petition.

Cir. 1988).\n      \n\n         An initial problem with the present  injunction is\n\nthat  Cok was  not  warned or  otherwise given  notice that\n\nfiling  restrictions  were  contemplated.    She  thus  was\n\n                            -6-\n\nwithout an opportunity  to respond  before the  restrictive\n\nfiling  order was entered.  Adequate notice may be informal\n\nbut should  be afforded.   For  example, in  Pavilonis, 626\n                                                      \n\nF.2d at  1077, a  magistrate's report recommended  that the\n\ndistrict court impose filing restrictions and the plaintiff\n\nfiled  objections to that report.   In Castro,  775 F.2d at\n                                             \n\n402,  the defendants  tried to  enjoin the  plaintiffs from\n\nrelitigating matters arising out of the case at hand or any\n\nearlier   litigation   between    the   parties.

If they were, the court\n\nshould have  explained why it  felt it appropriate  to ban,\n\nwithout  findings as to the abuses  of the judicial process\n\ncausing imposition  of the injunction, the  commencement of\n\n\"any  actions in this court\" (as opposed, for example, to a\n\nban  merely on further  attempts, without authorization, to\n\nremove,  pro se,  more  proceedings from  the Rhode  Island\n\nFamily Court divorce case).  See Sires, 748 F.2d at 51; see\n                                                           \n\nalso De Long,  912 F.2d at 1148; In re  Powell, 851 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n431.  Injunctions restricting court access across the board\n\nin  all cases are very  much \"the exception  to the general\n\nrule of free access to the courts.\"  Pavilonis, 626 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n1079.   They  should  be  issued  only  when  abuse  is  so\n\ncontinuous  and  widespread  as  to  suggest  no reasonable\n\nalternative.\n\n         We emphasize that it is the breadth of the instant\n\norder  that causes us some  concern.  Had  the court, after\n\nnotice and opportunity to respond, merely enjoined Cok from\n\nfurther frivolous removals from  the family court, we would\n\nhave doubtless approved.   The present record supports such\n\na  limited  order.    We  have  not  hesitated   to  uphold\n\ninjunctions   that  were  narrowly  drawn  to  counter  the\n\n                            -9-\n\nspecific offending conduct.   Castro, 775 F.2d at  410; cf.\n                                                           \n\nPavilonis,   626  F.2d  at   1079  (upholding  issuance  of\n         \n\ninjunction but narrowing its scope).  But this order is not\n\nlimited to  restricting improper conduct of  the type which\n\nthe present record indicates plaintiff has displayed in the\n\npast.  If  the \"specific  vice\" sought to  be curtailed  is\n\nsimply the appellant's  propensity, as here and in 1984, to\n\nattempt improper removals to federal court of matters based\n\non her  state divorce  proceeding, the district  court may,\n\nafter notice, wish to enter an order limiting such conduct.\n\nSee  Castro, 775 F.2d  at 410.   On the other  hand, if the\n           \n\ncourt means to issue a more generalized injunction aimed at\n\npreventing the  bringing of any and all  unpermitted pro se\n                                                           \n\nactions in  the district  court, it  must develop  a record\n\nshowing such widespread abuse of the judicial system  as to\n\nwarrant such a broadcast prohibition.
