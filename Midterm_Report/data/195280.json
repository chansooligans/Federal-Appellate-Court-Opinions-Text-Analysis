Hawkins and Hawkins, Rhodes &amp; Sharp.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Plaintiff-appellant  A.  G. Edwards,\n                     \n\nJr.,  has brought a pro  se appeal from  the district court's\n\njudgment dismissing Edwards'  claims against nine defendants:\n\nthe John Hancock Mutual  Life Insurance Co. (\"John Hancock\"),\n\nsix John Hancock employees,  Nevada attorney Prince  Hawkins,\n\nand the Nevada law firm of Hawkins,  Rhodes &amp; Sharp.  Edwards\n\nalso appeals  from the  district court's  ruling transferring\n\nEdwards' claims against  the remaining  defendant, the  First\n\nAmerican  Title  Insurance  Co.  (\"First  American\"), to  the\n\nDistrict of Nevada on grounds of  convenience under 28 U.S.C.\n\n  1404(a).\n\n          In the 1970's the  Saval Ranching Co. (\"Saval\"), of\n\nwhich Edwards  was part owner and later  sole owner, borrowed\n\nmoney  from  John Hancock.    As  security, Saval  gave  John\n\nHancock deeds  of trust to  two commercial cattle  ranches in\n\nNevada owned  by Saval.   In  1985, at  a  time when  Edwards\n\nresided in Massachusetts, John Hancock foreclosed on  Saval's\n\nranches.   John Hancock  foreclosed  through First  American,\n\nwhich was John  Hancock's trustee  on the deeds  of trust  to\n\nSaval's ranches.   Hawkins and his law firm  represented John\n\nHancock in the foreclosure proceedings.  \n\n          The  deeds  of trust  to Saval's  ranches expressly\n\nincluded the mineral, oil, and gas rights pertaining to those\n\nranches.   In  preparing for  the foreclosure  sale, however,\n\nFirst American  excluded these  mineral, oil, and  gas rights\n\nfrom the published description of the  properties to be sold.\n\nAlthough he could not bid on the properties, Edwards attended\n\nthe  August 15, 1985 Nevada  foreclosure sale.   At that sale\n\nthe United  States government  purchased  the properties  and\n\nacquired  the  release  of  John Hancock's  interest  in  the\n\nproperties.  Edwards subsequently moved from Massachusetts to\n\nNew Hampshire.  \n\n          The  U.S. then  filed suit  against Edwards  in the\n\nfederal  district  court  in  Nevada to  recover  a  $600,000\n\ndeficiency.  The Nevada  court ruled on January 5,  1988 that\n\nFirst American  had  violated applicable  Nevada  foreclosure\n\nstatutes by excepting  the mineral, oil, and  gas rights from\n\nthe  description  of  the  properties,  and  invalidated  the\n\nforeclosure.   In 1989, Edwards  and the U.S.  entered into a\n\nsettlement agreement  by which  the U.S. transferred  all its\n\ninterest in the  properties to Edwards in return for a sum of\n\nmoney.\n\n          On  January 25,  1991,  Edwards filed  suit in  the\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts against John\n\nHancock.   The suit, which included claims for negligence and\n\nfor breach of contract, sought damages for the underinclusive\n\nproperty description  in the notices of  the foreclosure sale\n\nof the Saval ranches.   The district court dismissed Edwards'\n\nnegligence claim  as time-barred, and  dismissed his contract\n\nclaim  on the  merits.   On  September  4, 1992,  this  court\n\n                             -3-\n\naffirmed the  dismissal of the negligence  claim, vacated the\n\ndismissal  of the  contract claim,  and remanded  for further\n\nproceedings.  Edwards  v. John Hancock Mutual  Life Ins. Co.,\n                                                           \n\n973 F.2d 1027 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Edwards filed the instant  pro se lawsuit on August\n\n12,  1991 in  the  District Court  for  the District  of  New\n\nHampshire.  His original  complaint named only First American\n\nand sought damages  for First  American's alleged  negligence\n\nand breach  of contract in carrying out the foreclosure sale.\n\nOn June 2, 1992, Edwards filed an amended pro se complaint in\n\nwhich he  added  the other  nine  defendants and  also  added\n\nadditional grounds for relief.  \n\n          On March 23, 1993, the district court (1) dismissed\n\nEdwards'  claims against  the eight  non-corporate defendants\n\nfor  lack  of personal  jurisdiction  in  New Hampshire;  (2)\n\ndismissed Edwards'  claims against  John Hancock in  light of\n\nEdwards'  pre-existing  suit  against  John  Hancock  in  the\n\nDistrict  of  Massachusetts;  and  (3)  transferred  Edwards'\n\nclaims  against  First American  to  the  District of  Nevada\n\npursuant to  28 U.S.C.    1404(a).   Edwards appeals,  having\n\nbeen  issued a  Fed.  R. Civ.  P.  54(b) certificate  by  the\n\ndistrict court.  \n\n       Claims Against the Eight Non-Corporate Defendants\n                                                        \n\n                             -4-\n\n          The  district  court   dismissed  Edwards'   claims\n\nagainst the  eight non-corporate defendants --  i.e., the six\n\nJohn  Hancock  employees  (Pearson, Gordon,  McElwee,  Brown,\n\nMcKiernan, and Duncan), Nevada attorney Hawkins, and Hawkins'\n\nlaw  firm -- on the ground that New Hampshire lacked personal\n\njurisdiction  over any of them under  the New Hampshire long-\n\narm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   510:4.  \n\n          Although Edwards appears to concede in his brief on\n\nappeal  that New Hampshire  lacked personal jurisdiction over\n\nthese eight defendants, in his reply brief he insists that he\n\ndid not mean to  waive that issue.  Assuming,  arguendo, that\n\nthe issue is properly before us, we would affirm the district\n\ncourt's  ruling on this point  for the reasons  stated in the\n\ndistrict  court's March  23,  1993 order.    Edwards did  not\n\nadequately allege that any of  these non-corporate defendants\n\n--   as  distinguished  from   their  corporate  employer  or\n\nprincipal,   John  Hancock  --   transacted  business,  owned\n\nproperty, or committed a tortious act in New Hampshire within\n\nthe meaning of the New Hampshire  long-arm statute, N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. 510:4.  There is no dispute  that the alleged tort\n\n--  underinclusive  description   of  Saval's  properties  in\n\nconnection  with the  1985  foreclosure sale  -- occurred  in\n\nNevada  and that  Edwards  resided in  Massachusetts at  that\n\ntime.   Since  this is not  a continuing tort,  the fact that\n\nEdwards  moved to  New Hampshire  after the  foreclosure sale\n\n                             -5-\n\ndoes not mean that the alleged tort occurred, in part, in New\n\nHampshire.   \n\n          Edwards  argues that  instead  of dismissing  these\n\nclaims, the district court should have transferred the claims\n\nto another forum which  would have personal jurisdiction over\n\nthese eight non-corporate defendants.  The district court did\n\nnot deal with this point in its opinion.\n\n          Edwards  bases his  argument on  28 U.S.C.    1631,\n\nwhich provides that whenever  a \"court finds that there  is a\n\nwant  of jurisdiction,  the  court shall,  if  it is  in  the\n\ninterest of justice, transfer such action  . . . to any other\n\nsuch court in which the action  . . . could have been brought\n\nat the time it was filed.\"  There is no question in this case\n\nthat the  district court  had jurisdiction over  the subject-\n\nmatter of this action; it was personal jurisdiction  that was\n\nlacking.    Some  courts   and  commentators,  relying  on  a\n\nconstruction  of  the legislative  history  of    1631,  have\n\nsuggested  that a court may  transfer an action  under   1631\n\nonly when  it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal\n                                                    \n\njurisdiction.   See, e.g., Levy v. Pyramid Co. of Ithaca, 687\n                                                        \n\nF.  Supp. 48, 51 (N.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd, 871 F.2d 9 (2nd Cir.\n                                       \n\n1989);  15 Wright,  Miller,  &amp; Cooper,  Federal Practice  and\n\nProcedure   3842, at 323 (2nd ed. 1986).   By contrast, other\n\ncourts  -- pointing to the  language of    1631 itself, which\n\nspeaks of \"jurisdiction\" and  makes no further distinction --\n\n                             -6-\n\nhave  held that     1631 does  permit  a transfer  where  the\n\ntranferor court lacks personal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Ross\n                                                             \n\nv. Colorado Outward  Bound School, Inc., 822  F.2d 1524, 1527\n                                      \n\n(10th   Cir.   1987);  United   States   v.  American   River\n                                                             \n\nTransportation, Inc., 150 F.R.D. 587  (C.D. Ill. 1993).  This\n                   \n\ncourt has yet to rule on the issue.    \n\n          We  need not  do so  here.   Regardless  of whether\n\ntransfer  is sought under    1631, under 28  U.S.C.   1404(a)\n\n(which provides  that \"[f]or  the convenience of  parties and\n\nwitnesses, in the interest  of justice, a district  court may\n\ntransfer any civil  action to any other district  or division\n\nwhere  it might  have been  brought\"), or  under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1406(a)  (which  provides that  \"[t]he  district  court of  a\n\ndistrict in which  is filed a case laying venue  in the wrong\n\ndivision  or district  shall  dismiss, or  if  it be  in  the\n\ninterest of justice,  transfer such case  to any district  or\n\ndivision in  which  it could  have been  brought\"), we  would\n\naffirm  the denial  of  a transfer  because  all of  Edwards'\n\nclaims against  the eight non-corporate defendants were time-\n\nbarred,  under  all statutes  of  limitations  that might  be\n\napplicable,  at the time he filed those claims in the instant\n\ncase.  A federal court may  not transfer an action to another\n\ncourt under   1631 if the action was time-barred  at the time\n\nit was  filed.  See, e.g.,  Billops v. Department  of the Air\n                                                             \n\nForce,  725  F.2d 1160,  1163  (8th Cir.  1984).   Similarly,\n     \n\n                             -7-\n\ntransfer  under either   1404(a) or   1406(a) would not serve\n\nthe  interests of justice where the action was time-barred at\n\nthe time it was filed.   See, e.g., McTyre v. Broward General\n                                                             \n\nMedical Center, 749 F.Supp. 102, 105-09 (D.N.J. 1990).\n              \n\n          Edwards asserted  six causes of action against some\n\nor all of these eight defendants:  (1) negligence; (2) breach\n\nof  contract; (3) breach of an implied covenant of good faith\n\nand fair dealing; (4)  violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C.     1961-\n\n68;  (5) violation of  the Massachusetts  Consumer Protection\n\nAct, Mass. Gen. Laws  93A; and (6) deceptive  trade practices\n\nunder  Nevada statutes.  In Edwards' prior appeal arising out\n\nof the similar action  Edwards brought in Massachusetts, this\n\ncourt  has already  ruled that Edwards'  cause of  action for\n\nnegligence was  time-barred under  Massachusetts law  at some\n\ntime before  January 1991, i.e., before  Edwards filed either\n\nthe complaint or the amended complaint in the instant action.\n\nEdwards, supra, 973 F.2d at 1029-30.\n              \n\n          All  other possible statutes of limitations for any\n\nof Edwards' claims -- whether under Nevada, Massachusetts, or\n\nNew Hampshire law --- are six years or  less.  The applicable\n\nlimitations period  for a negligence  action is six  years in\n\nNew  Hampshire, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 508:4, I, and four years\n\nin  Nevada, Nev. Rev. Stat.    11.190, 2(c).   The applicable\n\nlimitations period  for a contract  action, or an  action for\n\nbreach of an implied covenant of  good faith, is six years in\n\n                             -8-\n\nMassachusetts, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 260,   2; six  years in New\n\nHampshire, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 508:4, I; and either  six or\n\nfour years in Nevada,  Nev. Rev. Stat.   11.190,  1(b), 2(c).\n\nThe limitations period for a civil RICO action is four years.\n\nAgency Holding  Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp;  Associates, Inc., 483\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 143, 156 (1987).   The limitations period for  an action\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws c. 93A is four years.   Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nc. 260,   5A.   Finally, Edwards has not  disputed appellees'\n\nassertion  that the  limitations period  for an  action under\n\nNevada  deceptive trade  practices  statutes is  four  years.\n\nNev. Rev. Stat.    598A.220, 11.220.  \n\n          This court already has  strongly suggested, if  not\n\nexpressly held,  that under Massachusetts law  Edwards' cause\n\nof  action  for  negligence  accrued   by  the  time  of  the\n\nforeclosure sale, i.e., by August 15, 1985.   Edwards, supra,\n                                                            \n\n973 F.2d at 1029-30.   Appellees urge that this  accrual date\n\nshould govern all of Edwards' causes of action.\n\n          Edwards has  given no reason,  and we see  none, to\n\nthink  that his  contract-based  claims  and  his  tort-based\n\nclaims should be governed by different accrual dates.  In his\n\nbrief  on appeal,  moreover, Edwards  expressly accepted  the\n\nAugust 15, 1985 accrual date.  \n\n          In   his  reply   brief,  Edwards   does  belatedly\n\nchallenge this  accrual date.   However, his  only challenge,\n\nwhether  as  a matter  of  Massachusetts,  New Hampshire,  or\n\n                             -9-\n\nNevada law, is his  contention that his causes of  action did\n\nnot  accrue  until mid-1990,  when  the  U.S. Forest  Service\n\nallegedly cancelled  his grazing permit for  livestock on his\n\nSaval ranches.  He alleges that this cancellation \"[d]irectly\n\nderiv[ed]\" from the defective foreclosure sale and caused him\n\nsubstantial economic harm.  \n\n          This argument has no  merit because there has been,\n\nand can be, no dispute that Edwards was on notice of possible\n\nsubstantial injury  as of  the August 1985  foreclosure sale,\n\nwhen the underinclusive property description may have  caused\n\nthe Saval ranches to  be sold for a lower price.   A cause of\n\naction  accrues when  a plaintiff  has \"knowledge,  actual or\n\nattibuted, of  both harm to it  and the likely  cause of such\n\nharm, . . . sufficient to stimulate further inquiry which was\n\nlikely to alert it to a cause of action against a defendant.\"\n\nHanson  Housing Authority  v. Dryvit  System, Inc.,  29 Mass.\n                                                 \n\nApp. Ct. 440, 446,  560 N.E.2d 1290, 1294 (1990),  rev. den.,\n                                                           \n\n409  Mass. 1101,  565 N.E.2d  792  (1991).   The fact  that a\n\nplaintiff subsequently  suffers some additional harm that may\n\nbe traced to the same likely cause does  not delay accrual of\n\nthe cause  of action.   Id.  (\"It  is not  required that  the\n                          \n\nextent  of injury  be  known before  accrual  of a  cause  of\n\naction\");  Rowe v. John Deere,  130 N.H. 18,  21-23, 533 A.2d\n                             \n\n375, 376-78  (1987).  See  Sorenson v.  Pavlikowski, 94  Nev.\n                                                   \n\n440, 443-44, 581 P.2d 851, 853-54 (1978).  \n\n                             -10-\n\n          Accordingly, with an accrual  date of no later than\n\nAugust 15, 1985, the latest Edwards could have brought any of\n\nhis claims  against any  of these  defendants was  August 15,\n\n1991.    Edwards'   amended  complaint  naming   these  eight\n\ndefendants was not filed until June 2, 1992.\n\n          Although  Edwards'  original  complaint  was  filed\n\nthree  days before August  15, 1991, it  did not name  any of\n\nthese defendants.  Edwards has not argued that the provisions\n\nof Fed. R. Civ.  P. 15(c) -- setting forth  the circumstances\n\nunder which claims raised in an  amended complaint can relate\n\nback  to the time the  original complaint was  filed -- apply\n\nhere.   Even if he had  raised this argument --  we note that\n\nboth  appellees'  briefs  do   discuss  this  point,  despite\n\nEdwards' failure to raise it -- we see no merit in it.  \n\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1) permits relation back when\n\n\"relation  back is  permitted by  the law  that  provides the\n\nstatute  of limitations applicable  to the action.\"   None of\n\nthe statutes of limitations  which may possibly apply to  any\n\nof Edwards' claims contains such a provision.\n\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(2) permits relation back when\n\n\"the claim or defense asserted  in the amended pleading arose\n\nout of  the conduct, transaction, or occurrence  set forth or\n\nattempted  to be set forth  in the original  pleading.\"  This\n\nprovision  governs the assertion of new  legal theories in an\n\namended  complaint,  and  does  not apply  when  the  amended\n\n                             -11-\n\ncomplaint  seeks  to  add  new  parties.    See  Jacobson  v.\n                                                         \n\nMcIlwain, 145 F.R.D. 595, 603 (S.D. Fla. 1992).\n        \n\n          Finally, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3) permits  relation\n\nback  of an  amendment  adding  new  parties when  the  claim\n\nasserted arose out of  the conduct set forth in  the original\n\npleading,  as required  by  Rule 15(c)(2),  \"and, within  the\n\nperiod  [120 days] provided by  Rule 4(j) for  service of the\n\nsummons  and  complaint,  the  party  to  be  brought  in  by\n\namendment (A)  has received such notice of the institution of\n\nthe  action  that  the  party  will   not  be  prejudiced  in\n\nmaintaining a defense on  the merits, and (B) knew  or should\n\nhave known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of\n\nthe proper party, the action would have been brought  against\n\nthe  party.\"   Edwards  meets  neither  of these  latter  two\n\nrequirements here.  \n\n          Edwards has  said nothing  to indicate that  any of\n\nthe  eight  non-corporate  defendants  named  in  the amended\n\ncomplaint  received notice  of the original  complaint within\n\n120 days of its filing.  Nor is there anything  in the record\n\nto  suggest  that Edwards  made  some  mistake regarding  the\n\nproper party to  be sued,  rather than merely  deciding at  a\n\nlater  time to  sue  further  parties  in addition  to  First\n\nAmerican.   Indeed, Edwards  himself acknowledged as  much in\n\nhis memorandum in support  of his motion to file  the amended\n\ncomplaint, when he stated, \"The plaintiff has further studied\n\n                             -12-\n\nhis  cause of  Action  in  this  matter  and  has  found  the\n\njustification to  enlarge  his Complaint  by adding  relevant\n\nsupplementary  averments  and  by naming  related  additional\n\nappropriate Defendants.\"   \n\n          Edwards argues in his brief on appeal that after he\n\nfiled his  original complaint, and  also after  he filed  his\n\namended complaint, the clerk of the district court improperly\n\ndelayed  issuing a  summons as  required by  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n4(a).    This  impropriety,  according  to  Edwards,  delayed\n\nservice of process upon the defendants.  \n\n          We need not  consider this matter  because Edwards'\n\ncontention, even if true, is irrelevant to our decision.  All\n\nof Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants\n\nwere  time-barred  before  June  2, 1992,  when  the  amended\n\ncomplaint naming these defendants  was filed.  Any subsequent\n\ndelay in  service of process on  these defendants, therefore,\n\nwas beside the  point.   Even if somehow  the district  court\n\nclerk  improperly  prevented  Edwards  from  providing  these\n\ndefendants with timely notice  of his original complaint, and\n\nthose  circumstances  somehow  satisfied   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.\n\n15(c)(3)(A) (points which are by  no means clear), this would\n\navail Edwards  nothing, since we have already  held that Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(B) was not satisfied.   \n\n                Claims Against John Hancock\n                                           \n\n                             -13-\n\n          As we have said, on January 25, 1991 -- well over a\n\nyear  before  the filing  of  his  amended  complaint in  the\n\ninstant case  adding claims  against John Hancock  -- Edwards\n\nfiled a similar suit  in the District Court for  the District\n\nof Massachusetts, naming John  Hancock as the only defendant.\n\nEdwards' Massachusetts lawsuit, like the instant suit, sought\n\nto recover damages,  based on counts of negligence and breach\n\nof contract, for  the underinclusive property description  in\n\nthe notices of the foreclosure sale of the Saval ranches.\n\n          The    district   court   found   that   both   the\n\nMassachusetts lawsuit  and  Edwards' instant  claims  against\n\nJohn Hancock involved  the same issues and  the same parties.\n\nAccordingly,  the  district court  dismissed  Edwards' claims\n\nagainst  John  Hancock,  citing  the   \"generally  recognized\n\ndoctrine of federal comity which permits a district  court to\n\ndecline   jurisdiction  over  an   action  when  a  complaint\n\ninvolving the same parties and issues has  already been filed\n\nin another district.\"  Pacesetter Systems, Inc. v.

It  is well-settled that  such a transfer\n\norder under   1404(a) is an interlocutory order and therefore\n\nis not appealable as a final judgment.  Codex Corp.  v.

Since  Edwards  has not  obtained  a\n\ncertificate  for  interlocutory  appeal  under  28  U.S.C.   \n\n1292(b), we lack jurisdiction over this aspect of his appeal.\n\n          In any event, even if we had jurisdiction, we would\n\naffirm the  district court's transfer ruling  for the reasons\n\nstated  in the district court's  March 23, 1993  order.  Only\n\nunder  unusual  circumstances  would  we  disturb a  district\n\ncourt's exercise of discretion in ordering a transfer under  \n\n1404(a).  Id.

As the district court stated, if\n\nviewed as  a Fed. R. Civ.

G. Edwards, Jr., has brought a pro se appeal from the district court's judgment dismissing Edwards' claims against nine defendants:  the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.  (\"John Hancock\"), six John Hancock employees, Nevada attorney Prince Hawkins, and the Nevada law firm of Hawkins, Rhodes &amp; Sharp.  Edwards also appeals from the district court's ruling transferring Edwards' claims against the remaining defendant, the First American Title Insurance Co.  (\"First American\"), to the District of Nevada on grounds of convenience under 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1404(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970's the Saval Ranching Co.  (\"Saval\"), of which Edwards was part owner and later sole owner, borrowed money from John Hancock.  As security, Saval gave John Hancock deeds of trust to two commercial cattle ranches in Nevada owned by Saval.  In 1985, at a time when Edwards resided in Massachusetts, John Hancock foreclosed on Saval's ranches.  John Hancock foreclosed through First American, which was John Hancock's trustee on the deeds of trust to Saval's ranches.  Hawkins and his law firm represented John Hancock in the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deeds of trust to Saval's ranches expressly included the mineral, oil, and gas rights pertaining to those ranches.  In preparing for the foreclosure sale, however, First American excluded these mineral, oil, and gas rights from the published description of the properties to be sold.  Although he could not bid on the properties, Edwards attended the August 15, 1985 Nevada foreclosure sale.  At that sale the United States government purchased the properties and acquired the release of John Hancock's interest in the properties.  Edwards subsequently moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. then filed suit against Edwards in the federal district court in Nevada to recover a $600,000 deficiency.  The Nevada court ruled on January 5, 1988 that First American had violated applicable Nevada foreclosure statutes by excepting the mineral, oil, and gas rights from the description of the properties, and invalidated the foreclosure.  In 1989, Edwards and the U.S. entered into a settlement agreement by which the U.S. transferred all its interest in the properties to Edwards in return for a sum of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, Edwards filed suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts against John Hancock.  The suit, which included claims for negligence and for breach of contract, sought damages for the underinclusive property description in the notices of the foreclosure sale of the Saval ranches.  The district court dismissed Edwards' negligence claim as time-barred, and dismissed his contract claim on the merits.  On September 4, 1992, this court affirmed the dismissal of the negligence claim, vacated the dismissal of the contract claim, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.

His original complaint named only First American and sought damages for First American's alleged negligence and breach of contract in carrying out the foreclosure sale.  On June 2, 1992, Edwards filed an amended pro se complaint in which he added the other nine defendants and also added additional grounds for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1993, the district court (1) dismissed Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction in New Hampshire;  (2) dismissed Edwards' claims against John Hancock in light of Edwards' pre-existing suit against John Hancock in the District of Massachusetts;  and (3) transferred Edwards' claims against First American to the District of Nevada pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a).  Edwards appeals, having been issued a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54(b) certificate by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against the Eight Non-Corporate Defendants</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants-i.e., the six John Hancock employees (Pearson, Gordon, McElwee, Brown, McKiernan, and Duncan), Nevada attorney Hawkins, and Hawkins' law firm-on the ground that New Hampshire lacked personal jurisdiction over any of them under the New Hampshire long-arm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. Sec. 510:4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Edwards appears to concede in his brief on appeal that New Hampshire lacked personal jurisdiction over these eight defendants, in his reply brief he insists that he did not mean to waive that issue.  Assuming, arguendo, that the issue is properly before us, we would affirm the district court's ruling on this point for the reasons stated in the district court's March 23, 1993 order.  Edwards did not adequately allege that any of these non-corporate defendants-as distinguished from their corporate employer or principal, John Hancock-transacted business, owned property, or committed a tortious act in New Hampshire within the meaning of the New Hampshire long-arm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 510:4.  There is no dispute that the alleged tort-underinclusive description of Saval's properties in connection with the 1985 foreclosure sale-occurred in Nevada and that Edwards resided in Massachusetts at that time.  Since this is not a continuing tort, the fact that Edwards moved to New Hampshire after the foreclosure sale does not mean that the alleged tort occurred, in part, in New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards argues that instead of dismissing these claims, the district court should have transferred the claims to another forum which would have personal jurisdiction over these eight non-corporate defendants.  The district court did not deal with this point in its opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards bases his argument on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, which provides that whenever a \"court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action ... to any other such court in which the action ... could have been brought at the time it was filed.\"  There is no question in this case that the district court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter of this action;  it was personal jurisdiction that was lacking.  Some courts and commentators, relying on a construction of the legislative history of Sec. 1631, have suggested that a court may transfer an action under Sec. 1631 only when it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.   See, e.g., Levy v. Pyramid Co. of Ithaca, 687 F. Supp. 48, 51 (N.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd, 871 F.2d 9 (2nd Cir. 1989);  15 Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3842, at 323 (2nd ed. 1986).  By contrast, other courts-pointing to the language of Sec. 1631 itself, which speaks of \"jurisdiction\" and makes no further distinction-have held that Sec. 1631 does permit a transfer where the tranferor court lacks personal jurisdiction.   See, e.g., Ross v. Colorado Outward Bound School, Inc., 822 F.2d 1524, 1527 (10th Cir. 1987);   United States v. American River Transportation, Inc., 150 F.R.D. 587 (C.D. Ill. 1993).  This court has yet to rule on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not do so here.  Regardless of whether transfer is sought under Sec. 1631, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (which provides that \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought\"), or under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1406(a) (which provides that \"[t]he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought\"), we would affirm the denial of a transfer because all of Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants were time-barred, under all statutes of limitations that might be applicable, at the time he filed those claims in the instant case.  A federal court may not transfer an action to another court under Sec. 1631 if the action was time-barred at the time it was filed.   See, e.g., Billops v. Department of the Air Force, 725 F.2d 1160, 1163 (8th Cir. 1984).  Similarly, transfer under either Sec. 1404(a) or Sec. 1406(a) would not serve the interests of justice where the action was time-barred at the time it was filed.   See, e.g., McTyre v. Broward General Medical Center, 749 F.Supp. 102, 105-09 (D.N.J. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards asserted six causes of action against some or all of these eight defendants:  (1) negligence;  (2) breach of contract;  (3) breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing;  (4) violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1961-68;  (5) violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws 93A;  and (6) deceptive trade practices under Nevada statutes.  In Edwards' prior appeal arising out of the similar action Edwards brought in Massachusetts, this court has already ruled that Edwards' cause of action for negligence was time-barred under Massachusetts law at some time before January 1991, i.e., before Edwards filed either the complaint or the amended complaint in the instant action.   Edwards, supra, 973 F.2d at 1029-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All other possible statutes of limitations for any of Edwards' claims-whether under Nevada, Massachusetts, or New Hampshire law-are six years or less.  The applicable limitations period for a negligence action is six years in New Hampshire, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 508:4, I, and four years in Nevada, Nev.  Rev. Stat. Sec. 11.190, 2(c).  The applicable limitations period for a contract action, or an action for breach of an implied covenant of good faith, is six years in Massachusetts, Mass.  Gen. Laws c. 260, Sec. 2; six years in New Hampshire, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 508:4, I;  and either six or four years in Nevada, Nev.  Rev. Stat. Sec. 11.190, 1(b), 2(c).  The limitations period for a civil RICO action is four years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 156 (1987).  The limitations period for an action under Mass.  Gen. Laws c. 93A is four years.  Mass. Gen. Laws c. 260, Sec. 5A. Finally, Edwards has not disputed appellees' assertion that the limitations period for an action under Nevada deceptive trade practices statutes is four years.  Nev. Rev. Stat. Secs. 598A.220, 11.220.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court already has strongly suggested, if not expressly held, that under Massachusetts law Edwards' cause of action for negligence accrued by the time of the foreclosure sale, i.e., by August 15, 1985.   Edwards, supra, 973 F.2d at 1029-30.  Appellees urge that this accrual date should govern all of Edwards' causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards has given no reason, and we see none, to think that his contract-based claims and his tort-based claims should be governed by different accrual dates.  In his brief on appeal, moreover, Edwards expressly accepted the August 15, 1985 accrual date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his reply brief, Edwards does belatedly challenge this accrual date.  However, his only challenge, whether as a matter of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, or Nevada law, is his contention that his causes of action did not accrue until mid-1990, when the U.S. Forest Service allegedly cancelled his grazing permit for livestock on his Saval ranches.  He alleges that this cancellation \"[d]irectly deriv[ed]\" from the defective foreclosure sale and caused him substantial economic harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has no merit because there has been, and can be, no dispute that Edwards was on notice of possible substantial injury as of the August 1985 foreclosure sale, when the underinclusive property description may have caused the Saval ranches to be sold for a lower price.  A cause of action accrues when a plaintiff has \"knowledge, actual or attibuted, of both harm to it and the likely cause of such harm, ... sufficient to stimulate further inquiry which was likely to alert it to a cause of action against a defendant.\"   Hanson Housing Authority v. Dryvit System, Inc., 29 Mass.  App. Ct. 440, 446, 560 N.E.2d 1290, 1294 (1990), rev. den., 409 Mass. 1101, 565 N.E.2d 792 (1991).  The fact that a plaintiff subsequently suffers some additional harm that may be traced to the same likely cause does not delay accrual of the cause of action.  Id. (\"It is not required that the extent of injury be known before accrual of a cause of action\");   Rowe v. John Deere, 130 N.H. 18, 21-23, 533 A.2d 375, 376-78 (1987).   See Sorenson v. Pavlikowski, 94 Nev. 440, 443-44, 581 P.2d 851, 853-54 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, with an accrual date of no later than August 15, 1985, the latest Edwards could have brought any of his claims against any of these defendants was August 15, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards' amended complaint naming these eight defendants was not filed until June 2, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Edwards' original complaint was filed three days before August 15, 1991, it did not name any of these defendants.  Edwards has not argued that the provisions of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)-setting forth the circumstances under which claims raised in an amended complaint can relate back to the time the original complaint was filed-apply here.  Even if he had raised this argument-we note that both appellees' briefs do discuss this point, despite Edwards' failure to raise it-we see no merit in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1) permits relation back when \"relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action.\"  None of the statutes of limitations which may possibly apply to any of Edwards' claims contains such a provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(2) permits relation back when \"the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\"  This provision governs the assertion of new legal theories in an amended complaint, and does not apply when the amended complaint seeks to add new parties.   See Jacobson v. McIlwain, 145 F.R.D. 595, 603 (S.D. Fla. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3) permits relation back of an amendment adding new parties when the claim asserted arose out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading, as required by Rule 15(c)(2), \"and, within the period [120 days] provided by Rule 4(j) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\"  Edwards meets neither of these latter two requirements here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards has said nothing to indicate that any of the eight non-corporate defendants named in the amended complaint received notice of the original complaint within 120 days of its filing.  Nor is there anything in the record to suggest that Edwards made some mistake regarding the proper party to be sued, rather than merely deciding at a later time to sue further parties in addition to First American.  Indeed, Edwards himself acknowledged as much in his memorandum in support of his motion to file the amended complaint, when he stated, \"The plaintiff has further studied his cause of Action in this matter and has found the justification to enlarge his Complaint by adding relevant supplementary averments and by naming related additional appropriate Defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards argues in his brief on appeal that after he filed his original complaint, and also after he filed his amended complaint, the clerk of the district court improperly delayed issuing a summons as required by Fed.  R. Civ. P. 4(a).  This impropriety, according to Edwards, delayed service of process upon the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider this matter because Edwards' contention, even if true, is irrelevant to our decision.  All of Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants were time-barred before June 2, 1992, when the amended complaint naming these defendants was filed.  Any subsequent delay in service of process on these defendants, therefore, was beside the point.  Even if somehow the district court clerk improperly prevented Edwards from providing these defendants with timely notice of his original complaint, and those circumstances somehow satisfied Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(A) (points which are by no means clear), this would avail Edwards nothing, since we have already held that Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(B) was not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against John Hancock</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, on January 25, 1991-well over a year before the filing of his amended complaint in the instant case adding claims against John Hancock-Edwards filed a similar suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming John Hancock as the only defendant.  Edwards' Massachusetts lawsuit, like the instant suit, sought to recover damages, based on counts of negligence and breach of contract, for the underinclusive property description in the notices of the foreclosure sale of the Saval ranches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that both the Massachusetts lawsuit and Edwards' instant claims against John Hancock involved the same issues and the same parties.  Accordingly, the district court dismissed Edwards' claims against John Hancock, citing the \"generally recognized doctrine of federal comity which permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an action when a complaint involving the same parties and issues has already been filed in another district.\"   Pacesetter Systems, Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., 678 F.2d 93, 94-95 (9th Cir. 1982).  At the time of the district court's order, apparently Edwards' contract claim remained pending in the Massachusetts suit, although his negligence claim had been dismissed as time-barred.   See Edwards, supra, 973 F.2d 1027.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards does not appear to challenge this district court ruling in his brief on appeal.  In light of \"the settled appellate rule that issues ... unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation ... are deemed waived,\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990), we will not consider this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against First American</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court lacks appellate jurisdiction to consider Edwards' appeal from the district court's ruling transferring Edwards' claims against defendant-appellant First American Title Insurance Co. to the District of Nevada pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a).  It is well-settled that such a transfer order under Sec. 1404(a) is an interlocutory order and therefore is not appealable as a final judgment.   Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., 553 F.2d 735, 737 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 860 (1977).  Since Edwards has not obtained a certificate for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), we lack jurisdiction over this aspect of his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, even if we had jurisdiction, we would affirm the district court's transfer ruling for the reasons stated in the district court's March 23, 1993 order.  Only under unusual circumstances would we disturb a district court's exercise of discretion in ordering a transfer under Sec. 1404(a).  Id. Certainly no such circumstances exist here, given the undisputed facts that the events giving rise to Edwards' claims occurred primarily in Nevada, the Saval ranches are in Nevada, and relevant documents and witnesses will be readily available in Nevada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of Edwards' motion for reconsideration.  As the district court stated, if viewed as a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, the motion was untimely because it was served more than ten days after entry of judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  If viewed as a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion, the motion stated no possible basis for relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of Edwards' other arguments and find them meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request of Hawkins and Hawkins, Rhodes &amp; Sharp that sanctions, including attorneys' fees, be awarded against Edwards is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

G. Edwards, Jr., has brought a pro se appeal from the district court's judgment dismissing Edwards' claims against nine defendants:  the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.  (\"John Hancock\"), six John Hancock employees, Nevada attorney Prince Hawkins, and the Nevada law firm of Hawkins, Rhodes &amp; Sharp.  Edwards also appeals from the district court's ruling transferring Edwards' claims against the remaining defendant, the First American Title Insurance Co.  (\"First American\"), to the District of Nevada on grounds of convenience under 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1404(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970's the Saval Ranching Co.  (\"Saval\"), of which Edwards was part owner and later sole owner, borrowed money from John Hancock.  As security, Saval gave John Hancock deeds of trust to two commercial cattle ranches in Nevada owned by Saval.  In 1985, at a time when Edwards resided in Massachusetts, John Hancock foreclosed on Saval's ranches.  John Hancock foreclosed through First American, which was John Hancock's trustee on the deeds of trust to Saval's ranches.  Hawkins and his law firm represented John Hancock in the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deeds of trust to Saval's ranches expressly included the mineral, oil, and gas rights pertaining to those ranches.  In preparing for the foreclosure sale, however, First American excluded these mineral, oil, and gas rights from the published description of the properties to be sold.  Although he could not bid on the properties, Edwards attended the August 15, 1985 Nevada foreclosure sale.  At that sale the United States government purchased the properties and acquired the release of John Hancock's interest in the properties.  Edwards subsequently moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. then filed suit against Edwards in the federal district court in Nevada to recover a $600,000 deficiency.  The Nevada court ruled on January 5, 1988 that First American had violated applicable Nevada foreclosure statutes by excepting the mineral, oil, and gas rights from the description of the properties, and invalidated the foreclosure.  In 1989, Edwards and the U.S. entered into a settlement agreement by which the U.S. transferred all its interest in the properties to Edwards in return for a sum of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, Edwards filed suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts against John Hancock.  The suit, which included claims for negligence and for breach of contract, sought damages for the underinclusive property description in the notices of the foreclosure sale of the Saval ranches.  The district court dismissed Edwards' negligence claim as time-barred, and dismissed his contract claim on the merits.  On September 4, 1992, this court affirmed the dismissal of the negligence claim, vacated the dismissal of the contract claim, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards v.

His original complaint named only First American and sought damages for First American's alleged negligence and breach of contract in carrying out the foreclosure sale.  On June 2, 1992, Edwards filed an amended pro se complaint in which he added the other nine defendants and also added additional grounds for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1993, the district court (1) dismissed Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction in New Hampshire;  (2) dismissed Edwards' claims against John Hancock in light of Edwards' pre-existing suit against John Hancock in the District of Massachusetts;  and (3) transferred Edwards' claims against First American to the District of Nevada pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a).  Edwards appeals, having been issued a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54(b) certificate by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against the Eight Non-Corporate Defendants</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants-i.e., the six John Hancock employees (Pearson, Gordon, McElwee, Brown, McKiernan, and Duncan), Nevada attorney Hawkins, and Hawkins' law firm-on the ground that New Hampshire lacked personal jurisdiction over any of them under the New Hampshire long-arm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. Sec. 510:4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Edwards appears to concede in his brief on appeal that New Hampshire lacked personal jurisdiction over these eight defendants, in his reply brief he insists that he did not mean to waive that issue.  Assuming, arguendo, that the issue is properly before us, we would affirm the district court's ruling on this point for the reasons stated in the district court's March 23, 1993 order.  Edwards did not adequately allege that any of these non-corporate defendants-as distinguished from their corporate employer or principal, John Hancock-transacted business, owned property, or committed a tortious act in New Hampshire within the meaning of the New Hampshire long-arm statute, N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 510:4.  There is no dispute that the alleged tort-underinclusive description of Saval's properties in connection with the 1985 foreclosure sale-occurred in Nevada and that Edwards resided in Massachusetts at that time.  Since this is not a continuing tort, the fact that Edwards moved to New Hampshire after the foreclosure sale does not mean that the alleged tort occurred, in part, in New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards argues that instead of dismissing these claims, the district court should have transferred the claims to another forum which would have personal jurisdiction over these eight non-corporate defendants.  The district court did not deal with this point in its opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards bases his argument on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, which provides that whenever a \"court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action ... to any other such court in which the action ... could have been brought at the time it was filed.\"  There is no question in this case that the district court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter of this action;  it was personal jurisdiction that was lacking.  Some courts and commentators, relying on a construction of the legislative history of Sec. 1631, have suggested that a court may transfer an action under Sec. 1631 only when it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.   See, e.g., Levy v. Pyramid Co. of Ithaca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1767654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1767654/levy-v-pyramid-co-of-ithaca/\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

By contrast, other courts-pointing to the language of Sec. 1631 itself, which speaks of \"jurisdiction\" and makes no further distinction-have held that Sec. 1631 does permit a transfer where the tranferor court lacks personal jurisdiction.   See, e.g., Ross v. Colorado Outward Bound School, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490943\"><a href=\"/opinion/490943/luise-m-ross-as-administratrix-of-the-goods-chattels-and-credits-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>, 1527 (10th Cir. 1987);   United States v.

Ill. 1993).  This court has yet to rule on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not do so here.  Regardless of whether transfer is sought under Sec. 1631, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a) (which provides that \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought\"), or under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1406(a) (which provides that \"[t]he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought\"), we would affirm the denial of a transfer because all of Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants were time-barred, under all statutes of limitations that might be applicable, at the time he filed those claims in the instant case.  A federal court may not transfer an action to another court under Sec. 1631 if the action was time-barred at the time it was filed.   See, e.g., Billops v. Department of the Air Force, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430553\"><a href=\"/opinion/430553/bobby-d-billops-v-department-of-the-air-force-little-rock-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1163 (8th Cir. 1984).  Similarly, transfer under either Sec. 1404(a) or Sec. 1406(a) would not serve the interests of justice where the action was time-barred at the time it was filed.   See, e.g., McTyre v. Broward General Medical Center, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1616549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1616549/mctyre-v-broward-general-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Secs. 1961-68;  (5) violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws 93A;  and (6) deceptive trade practices under Nevada statutes.  In Edwards' prior appeal arising out of the similar action Edwards brought in Massachusetts, this court has already ruled that Edwards' cause of action for negligence was time-barred under Massachusetts law at some time before January 1991, i.e., before Edwards filed either the complaint or the amended complaint in the instant action.

Secs. 598A.220, 11.220.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court already has strongly suggested, if not expressly held, that under Massachusetts law Edwards' cause of action for negligence accrued by the time of the foreclosure sale, i.e., by August 15, 1985.   Edwards, supra, 973 F.2d at 1029-30.  Appellees urge that this accrual date should govern all of Edwards' causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards has given no reason, and we see none, to think that his contract-based claims and his tort-based claims should be governed by different accrual dates.  In his brief on appeal, moreover, Edwards expressly accepted the August 15, 1985 accrual date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his reply brief, Edwards does belatedly challenge this accrual date.  However, his only challenge, whether as a matter of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, or Nevada law, is his contention that his causes of action did not accrue until mid-1990, when the U.S. Forest Service allegedly cancelled his grazing permit for livestock on his Saval ranches.  He alleges that this cancellation \"[d]irectly deriv[ed]\" from the defective foreclosure sale and caused him substantial economic harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has no merit because there has been, and can be, no dispute that Edwards was on notice of possible substantial injury as of the August 1985 foreclosure sale, when the underinclusive property description may have caused the Saval ranches to be sold for a lower price.  A cause of action accrues when a plaintiff has \"knowledge, actual or attibuted, of both harm to it and the likely cause of such harm, ... sufficient to stimulate further inquiry which was likely to alert it to a cause of action against a defendant.\"   Hanson Housing Authority v. Dryvit System, Inc., 29 Mass.  App. Ct. 440, 446, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120857\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120857/hanson-housing-authority-v-dryvit-system-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1290</span></a></span>, 1294 (1990), rev. den., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></span> (1991).  The fact that a plaintiff subsequently suffers some additional harm that may be traced to the same likely cause does not delay accrual of the cause of action.  Id.

Edwards has not argued that the provisions of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)-setting forth the circumstances under which claims raised in an amended complaint can relate back to the time the original complaint was filed-apply here.  Even if he had raised this argument-we note that both appellees' briefs do discuss this point, despite Edwards' failure to raise it-we see no merit in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1) permits relation back when \"relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action.\"  None of the statutes of limitations which may possibly apply to any of Edwards' claims contains such a provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(2) permits relation back when \"the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\"  This provision governs the assertion of new legal theories in an amended complaint, and does not apply when the amended complaint seeks to add new parties.   See Jacobson v. McIlwain, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span>, 603 (S.D. Fla. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3) permits relation back of an amendment adding new parties when the claim asserted arose out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading, as required by Rule 15(c)(2), \"and, within the period [120 days] provided by Rule 4(j) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\"  Edwards meets neither of these latter two requirements here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards has said nothing to indicate that any of the eight non-corporate defendants named in the amended complaint received notice of the original complaint within 120 days of its filing.  Nor is there anything in the record to suggest that Edwards made some mistake regarding the proper party to be sued, rather than merely deciding at a later time to sue further parties in addition to First American.  Indeed, Edwards himself acknowledged as much in his memorandum in support of his motion to file the amended complaint, when he stated, \"The plaintiff has further studied his cause of Action in this matter and has found the justification to enlarge his Complaint by adding relevant supplementary averments and by naming related additional appropriate Defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards argues in his brief on appeal that after he filed his original complaint, and also after he filed his amended complaint, the clerk of the district court improperly delayed issuing a summons as required by Fed.  R. Civ. P. 4(a).  This impropriety, according to Edwards, delayed service of process upon the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider this matter because Edwards' contention, even if true, is irrelevant to our decision.  All of Edwards' claims against the eight non-corporate defendants were time-barred before June 2, 1992, when the amended complaint naming these defendants was filed.  Any subsequent delay in service of process on these defendants, therefore, was beside the point.  Even if somehow the district court clerk improperly prevented Edwards from providing these defendants with timely notice of his original complaint, and those circumstances somehow satisfied Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(A) (points which are by no means clear), this would avail Edwards nothing, since we have already held that Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(B) was not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against John Hancock</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, on January 25, 1991-well over a year before the filing of his amended complaint in the instant case adding claims against John Hancock-Edwards filed a similar suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming John Hancock as the only defendant.  Edwards' Massachusetts lawsuit, like the instant suit, sought to recover damages, based on counts of negligence and breach of contract, for the underinclusive property description in the notices of the foreclosure sale of the Saval ranches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that both the Massachusetts lawsuit and Edwards' instant claims against John Hancock involved the same issues and the same parties.  Accordingly, the district court dismissed Edwards' claims against John Hancock, citing the \"generally recognized doctrine of federal comity which permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an action when a complaint involving the same parties and issues has already been filed in another district.\"   Pacesetter Systems, Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403742\"><a href=\"/opinion/403742/pacesetter-systems-inc-v-medtronic-inc-and-med-rel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 94-95 (9th Cir. 1982).  At the time of the district court's order, apparently Edwards' contract claim remained pending in the Massachusetts suit, although his negligence claim had been dismissed as time-barred.   See Edwards, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589966\"><a href=\"/opinion/589966/a-greer-edwards-jr-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards does not appear to challenge this district court ruling in his brief on appeal.  In light of \"the settled appellate rule that issues ... unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation ... are deemed waived,\"  United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span> (1990), we will not consider this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Claims Against First American</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court lacks appellate jurisdiction to consider Edwards' appeal from the district court's ruling transferring Edwards' claims against defendant-appellant First American Title Insurance Co. to the District of Nevada pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a).  It is well-settled that such a transfer order under Sec. 1404(a) is an interlocutory order and therefore is not appealable as a final judgment.   Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344862\"><a href=\"/opinion/344862/codex-corporation-and-yellow-freight-system-inc-v-milgo-electronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 737 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109779\"><a href=\"/opinion/109779/amperex-electronic-corp-v-new-york-racing-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span> (1977).  Since Edwards has not obtained a certificate for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), we lack jurisdiction over this aspect of his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, even if we had jurisdiction, we would affirm the district court's transfer ruling for the reasons stated in the district court's March 23, 1993 order.  Only under unusual circumstances would we disturb a district court's exercise of discretion in ordering a transfer under Sec. 1404(a).  Id. Certainly no such circumstances exist here, given the undisputed facts that the events giving rise to Edwards' claims occurred primarily in Nevada, the Saval ranches are in Nevada, and relevant documents and witnesses will be readily available in Nevada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of Edwards' motion for reconsideration.  As the district court stated, if viewed as a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, the motion was untimely because it was served more than ten days after entry of judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  If viewed as a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion, the motion stated no possible basis for relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all of Edwards' other arguments and find them meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request of Hawkins and Hawkins, Rhodes &amp; Sharp that sanctions, including attorneys' fees, be awarded against Edwards is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
