Plaintiff-appellant  Oakville\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nDevelopment  Corporation (Oakville)  challenges orders  issued by\n\ntwo different  district judges which  had the combined  effect of\n\nallowing a foreclosure  sale to  proceed.  For  the reasons  that\n\nfollow, we dismiss Oakville's appeal as moot.\n\n                                I\n\n            Oakville borrowed $78,000  from First American  Bank.\n\nThe loan  was evidenced  by a  promissory note  and secured  by a\n\nsecond mortgage on  a parcel  of real property  located at  10-12\n\nLopez Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  On October 19, 1990, the\n\nbank  was declared  insolvent and  the Federal  Deposit Insurance\n\nCorporation (FDIC)  was appointed  as receiver.   Oakville's loan\n\nappeared on the bank's books as an asset.\n\n          The  FDIC   published   notice  to   First   American's\n\ncreditors, setting  a 90-day deadline  for the filing  of claims.\n\nBecause  Oakville  was mired  in  a dispute  with  First American\n\nregarding the  aforementioned loan,  it filed a  proof of  claim.\n\nThe FDIC  rejected Oakville's  claim as  untimely and  refused to\n\nentertain administrative appeals.  Oakville did not seek judicial\n\nreview within the time  allotted.  See 12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(6)(A)\n                                      \n\n(1988).  Some months later, however, Oakville sued in state court\n\nbased on First  American's alleged failure  to accept and  credit\n\npayments on the loan.  The FDIC removed the case to federal court\n\nand moved for dismissal.  The FDIC's motion remains undecided.\n\n          Because  Oakville's  payments  were   substantially  in\n\narrears, the FDIC  also embarked on foreclosure proceedings.   It\n\n                                2\n\nscheduled a  foreclosure  sale for  May  20, 1992.    On May  15,\n\nOakville  moved to  enjoin the  proposed sale.   On  May  19, the\n\ndistrict court (Skinner, U.S.D.J.) issued a temporary restraining\n\norder  (TRO) stalling the sale.   Oakville subsequently failed to\n\nsubmit  documents and appear  at a  hearing.   Accordingly, Judge\n\nSkinner dissolved the TRO on July 13, 1992.\n\n          The FDIC readvertised the  foreclosure sale, this  time\n\nstipulating  a  date  of August  12,  1992.    Oakville filed  an\n\nemergency  motion to  reinstate  the TRO.1    The district  court\n\n(Wolf, U.S.D.J.)  denied the  motion, determining that  the court\n\nlacked  statutory authority  to grant  an injunction  against the\n\nFDIC  qua receiver.   See 18 U.S.C.    1821(j) (1988).   Oakville\n                         \n\ntook  an appeal but did not request  a stay of the impending sale\n\n(although  counsel  claims  that  he circulated  notices  at  the\n\nauction, warning prospective bidders that an appeal was pending).\n\nThe property  was sold  to a  third party  and has  since changed\n\nhands.\n\n                                II\n\n          It  is important  to  stress that  Oakville takes  this\n\nappeal strictly and  solely from two interlocutory  orders of the\n\ndistrict court:   Judge Skinner's  order dissolving  the TRO  and\n\nJudge  Wolf's order  refusing to  reinstate the  injunction (and,\n\nthus, allowing  the  foreclosure sale  to proceed).   Hence,  the\n\nmerits are  not before us  and Oakville's action  remains pending\n\n                    \n\n     1The motion was filed on August 11, 1992.  Judge Skinner was\non vacation.  In his absence, Judge Wolf presided.\n\n                                3\n\nbelow.  Seen in  this light, it  is readily apparent that,  since\n\nthe  foreclosure  sale  has now  taken  place  and  title to  the\n\nproperty rests  with  a  third  party, reversing  the  orders  in\n\nquestion would give Oakville no more than a moral victory.  Ergo,\n\nits appeal is moot.   \n\n          Article  III of  the Constitution confines  the federal\n\ncourts'  jurisdiction  to those  claims  which  embody an  actual\n\n\"case\" or \"controversy.\"  U.S. Const.  art. III,   2, cl. 1.   It\n\nis well established  that, in circumstances where  a court cannot\n\nprovide  effectual relief,  no justiciable  case remains  and the\n\ncourt must dismiss the appeal  as moot.  See Mills v.  Green, 159\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 651, 653 (1895).  This doctrine applies with full force  and\n\neffect  where, as here, a  plaintiff appeals from the dissolution\n\nof an injunction or the denial of injunctive relief, but neglects\n\nto  obtain a stay.  When, as will often happen, the act sought to\n\nbe  enjoined actually  transpires,  the court  may thereafter  be\n\nunable  to fashion  a   meaningful anodyne.   In  such straitened\n\ncircumstances, the appeal becomes moot.  See, e.g., In re Stadium\n                                                                 \n\nManagement  Corp., 895 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding, in\n                 \n\nanalogous circumstances,  that \"[a]bsent  a stay, the  court must\n\ndismiss  a  pending  appeal as  moot  because  the  court has  no\n\nremedy\"); In re Continental Mortgage Investors, 578 F.2d 872, 877\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (explaining that \"[a]n appeal  is considered moot\n\nif it cannot affect the matter in issue or cannot grant effectual\n\nrelief\"); see  also Railway Labor Executives  Ass'n v.

We consider them seriatim.   \n                                                      \n\n                                A\n\n          Oakville  contends that we  can grant  effective relief\n\neven at this late date.  Its contention assumes that the sale can\n\nbe   voided  because  prospective  purchasers  were  notified  of\n\nOakville's pending appeal.2  Oakville's premise is wrong.\n\n          Oakville furnishes no authority to contradict the black\n\nletter  law that  a  sale to  a good  faith  purchaser cannot  be\n\nrescinded  in these circumstances.  See, e.g., Mass. Gen. L. Ann.\n                                             \n\nch. 106,   2-702 (West 1990) (explaining that a seller's right to\n\nreclaim   goods  is  subject  to  the  rights  of  a  good  faith\n\npurchaser).   Generally speaking, a  good faith purchaser  is one\n\nwho  purchases assets  for value,  without fraud,  misconduct, or\n\nknowledge of adverse  claims.  In re  Bel Air Assocs., Ltd.,  706\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  301,  304-05  (10th  Cir.  1983);  Greylock Glen  Corp.  v.\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     2We address this  argument even though  the record does  not\ncontain  a  copy of  the supposed  notice  or any  other specific\ninformation as  to its contents or  as to the manner  in which it\nwas distributed.\n\n                                5\n\nCommunity Sav. Bank, 656 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1981).   Knowledge\n                   \n\nof a pending appeal,  without more, does not deprive  a purchaser\n\nof good faith status.   Put another way, claims asserted in  such\n\nan  appeal are  not \"adverse  claims\" within  the meaning  of the\n\nrule.   See Greylock  Glen, 656 F.2d  at 4 (holding  that a bank,\n                          \n\nalthough  a party  to a  pending appeal,  was nonetheless  a good\n\nfaith purchaser); In re Dutch Inn of Orlando, Ltd., 614 F.2d 504,\n                                                  \n\n506  (5th  Cir. 1980)  (holding  that  a third-party  purchaser's\n\nknowledge  of claims asserted in a pending appeal did not deprive\n\nthe  purchaser  of  good  faith  protection);  see  also  Stadium\n                                                                 \n\nManagement, 895  F.2d at 848  n. 4;  cf. 11 U.S.C.    363(m)  (an\n                                        \n\nappeal  of the authorization to  hold a bankruptcy  sale does not\n\naffect the good faith  status of an ensuing transaction).   Thus,\n\nOakville  takes nothing simply  by reason  of having  told likely\n\nbidders about its pending appeal.\n\n                                B\n\n          Oakville's  second  basis for  claiming  that  we could\n\nstill grant  effective relief is  predicated on the  notion that,\n\nunder  Massachusetts law, it has a right to redeem the foreclosed\n\nproperty.3  Thus, its thesis runs, the appeal is alive because an\n\naffirmative exercise of redemptive  rights will unravel the sale.\n\nThe infertility of this theory is starkly apparent.\n\n           As  previously  remarked,  Oakville  appeals  only the\n\n                    \n\n     3Whether Oakville has such a right is far from pellucid.  In\ngeneral, Massachusetts law does not provide a right of redemption\nwhere  the  \"land has  been  sold pursuant  to  a  power of  sale\ncontained in the mortgage deed,\"   Mass. Gen. L. Ann. ch.  244,  \n18 (West 1988), as would appear to be the case here.\n\n                                6\n\ndissolution  of  the  TRO  and the  district  court's  subsequent\n\nrefusal to  reinstate it.   But,  redemption assumes  a completed\n\nforeclosure   not a stalled sale.  Thus, whatever state-law right\n\nof redemption Oakville might have is independent of the merits of\n\nthe challenged  orders.  Indeed, it is the lifting of the TRO and\n\nthe consequent happening of  the foreclosure that allows Oakville\n\nto pursue its  claimed redemptive  remedies.  What  is more,  our\n\ncontemplation  of  whatever  as-yet-unexercised redemptive  right\n\nOakville  may enjoy  would contravene  Article III's  prohibition\n\nagainst  advisory opinions.    See  Holloway,  789 F.2d  at  1374\n                                            \n\n(refusing to reach merits  of redemption argument where purchaser\n\nof  property was  not  a party  because  to do  so  would be  \"an\n\nadvisory opinion upon a moot question\") (citations omitted). \n\n                                C\n\n          Appellant  also  argues  that  its  appeal  skirts  the\n\njurisdictional bar because the  question presented is \"capable of\n\nrepetition, yet evading  review.\"  Southern Pac. Terminal  Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nICC,  219  U.S. 498,  515  (1911).   Although  this  asseveration\n   \n\nfastens  upon a  recognized  exception to  general principles  of\n\nmootness, see, e.g., Caroline  T. v. Hudson Sch. Dist.,  915 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n752, 757 (1st  Cir. 1990); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n61, 68 (1st Cir. 1987); Anderson v.

Rather,  the exception\n\napplies  only  if  there  is  \"a 'reasonable  expectation'  or  a\n\n'demonstrated probability'  that the same  controversy will recur\n\n                                7\n\ninvolving  the same complaining party.\"  Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n478, 482 (1982) (quoting Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149\n                                              \n\n(1975)).  \n\n          Appellant's case  does not  come within the  margins of\n\nthis  definition.    Unlike  pregnant women,  who  are  likely to\n\nconceive again,  see Roe v.  Wade, 410 U.S.  113, 125  (1973), or\n                                 \n\nhandicapped  children, who  are  likely to  require placement  in\n\nsubsequent school years, see  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S.  305, 317-23\n                                          \n\n(1988),  it is highly unlikely that appellant will again secure a\n\nmortgage with a federally insured bank that then fails, prompting\n\nFDIC  involvement and  ensuing foreclosure.4   Appellant  has not\n\nshown, or even  alleged, that  it has the  slightest prospect  of\n\nsuffering  this fate anew.   Instead, appellant contends that the\n\nFDIC's arbitrariness  will imperil  other property owners.   But,\n\neven  if  this  contention  is  true,  it  is  irrelevant:    the\n\npossibility   or even the probability   that others may be called\n\nupon  to  litigate similar  claims  does  not  save a  particular\n\nplaintiff's case from mootness.

Plaintiff-appellant  Oakville\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nDevelopment  Corporation (Oakville)  challenges orders  issued by\n\ntwo different  district judges which  had the combined  effect of\n\nallowing a foreclosure  sale to  proceed.  For  the reasons  that\n\nfollow, we dismiss Oakville's appeal as moot.\n\n                                I\n\n            Oakville borrowed $78,000  from First American  Bank.\n\nThe loan  was evidenced  by a  promissory note  and secured  by a\n\nsecond mortgage on  a parcel  of real property  located at  10-12\n\nLopez Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  On October 19, 1990, the\n\nbank  was declared  insolvent and  the Federal  Deposit Insurance\n\nCorporation (FDIC)  was appointed  as receiver.   Oakville's loan\n\nappeared on the bank's books as an asset.\n\n          The  FDIC   published   notice  to   First   American's\n\ncreditors, setting  a 90-day deadline  for the filing  of claims.\n\nBecause  Oakville  was mired  in  a dispute  with  First American\n\nregarding the  aforementioned loan,  it filed a  proof of  claim.\n\nThe FDIC  rejected Oakville's  claim as  untimely and  refused to\n\nentertain administrative appeals.  Oakville did not seek judicial\n\nreview within the time  allotted.  See 12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(6)(A)\n                                      \n\n(1988).  Some months later, however, Oakville sued in state court\n\nbased on First  American's alleged failure  to accept and  credit\n\npayments on the loan.  The FDIC removed the case to federal court\n\nand moved for dismissal.  The FDIC's motion remains undecided.\n\n          Because  Oakville's  payments  were   substantially  in\n\narrears, the FDIC  also embarked on foreclosure proceedings.   It\n\n                                2\n\nscheduled a  foreclosure  sale for  May  20, 1992.    On May  15,\n\nOakville  moved to  enjoin the  proposed sale.   On  May  19, the\n\ndistrict court (Skinner, U.S.D.J.) issued a temporary restraining\n\norder  (TRO) stalling the sale.   Oakville subsequently failed to\n\nsubmit  documents and appear  at a  hearing.   Accordingly, Judge\n\nSkinner dissolved the TRO on July 13, 1992.\n\n          The FDIC readvertised the  foreclosure sale, this  time\n\nstipulating  a  date  of August  12,  1992.    Oakville filed  an\n\nemergency  motion to  reinstate  the TRO.1    The district  court\n\n(Wolf, U.S.D.J.)  denied the  motion, determining that  the court\n\nlacked  statutory authority  to grant  an injunction  against the\n\nFDIC  qua receiver.   See 18 U.S.C.    1821(j) (1988).   Oakville\n                         \n\ntook  an appeal but did not request  a stay of the impending sale\n\n(although  counsel  claims  that  he circulated  notices  at  the\n\nauction, warning prospective bidders that an appeal was pending).\n\nThe property  was sold  to a  third party  and has  since changed\n\nhands.\n\n                                II\n\n          It  is important  to  stress that  Oakville takes  this\n\nappeal strictly and  solely from two interlocutory  orders of the\n\ndistrict court:   Judge Skinner's  order dissolving  the TRO  and\n\nJudge  Wolf's order  refusing to  reinstate the  injunction (and,\n\nthus, allowing  the  foreclosure sale  to proceed).   Hence,  the\n\nmerits are  not before us  and Oakville's action  remains pending\n\n                    \n\n     1The motion was filed on August 11, 1992.  Judge Skinner was\non vacation.  In his absence, Judge Wolf presided.\n\n                                3\n\nbelow.  Seen in  this light, it  is readily apparent that,  since\n\nthe  foreclosure  sale  has now  taken  place  and  title to  the\n\nproperty rests  with  a  third  party, reversing  the  orders  in\n\nquestion would give Oakville no more than a moral victory.  Ergo,\n\nits appeal is moot.   \n\n          Article  III of  the Constitution confines  the federal\n\ncourts'  jurisdiction  to those  claims  which  embody an  actual\n\n\"case\" or \"controversy.\"  U.S. Const.  art. III,   2, cl. 1.   It\n\nis well established  that, in circumstances where  a court cannot\n\nprovide  effectual relief,  no justiciable  case remains  and the\n\ncourt must dismiss the appeal  as moot.  See Mills v.  Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620957\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620957/mills-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (1895).  This doctrine applies with full force  and\n\neffect  where, as here, a  plaintiff appeals from the dissolution\n\nof an injunction or the denial of injunctive relief, but neglects\n\nto  obtain a stay.  When, as will often happen, the act sought to\n\nbe  enjoined actually  transpires,  the court  may thereafter  be\n\nunable  to fashion  a   meaningful anodyne.   In  such straitened\n\ncircumstances, the appeal becomes moot.

Its contention assumes that the sale can\n\nbe   voided  because  prospective  purchasers  were  notified  of\n\nOakville's pending appeal.2  Oakville's premise is wrong.\n\n          Oakville furnishes no authority to contradict the black\n\nletter  law that  a  sale to  a good  faith  purchaser cannot  be\n\nrescinded  in these circumstances.  See, e.g., Mass. Gen. L.

Thus,\n\nOakville  takes nothing simply  by reason  of having  told likely\n\nbidders about its pending appeal.\n\n                                B\n\n          Oakville's  second  basis for  claiming  that  we could\n\nstill grant  effective relief is  predicated on the  notion that,\n\nunder  Massachusetts law, it has a right to redeem the foreclosed\n\nproperty.3  Thus, its thesis runs, the appeal is alive because an\n\naffirmative exercise of redemptive  rights will unravel the sale.\n\nThe infertility of this theory is starkly apparent.\n\n           As  previously  remarked,  Oakville  appeals  only the\n\n                    \n\n     3Whether Oakville has such a right is far from pellucid.  In\ngeneral, Massachusetts law does not provide a right of redemption\nwhere  the  \"land has  been  sold pursuant  to  a  power of  sale\ncontained in the mortgage deed,\"   Mass. Gen. L. Ann. ch.  244,  \n18 (West 1988), as would appear to be the case here.\n\n                                6\n\ndissolution  of  the  TRO  and the  district  court's  subsequent\n\nrefusal to  reinstate it.   But,  redemption assumes  a completed\n\nforeclosure   not a stalled sale.  Thus, whatever state-law right\n\nof redemption Oakville might have is independent of the merits of\n\nthe challenged  orders.  Indeed, it is the lifting of the TRO and\n\nthe consequent happening of  the foreclosure that allows Oakville\n\nto pursue its  claimed redemptive  remedies.  What  is more,  our\n\ncontemplation  of  whatever  as-yet-unexercised redemptive  right\n\nOakville  may enjoy  would contravene  Article III's  prohibition\n\nagainst  advisory opinions.
