Appellant,  Charla Scivally,  appeals the\n                \n\ndismissal   of  her  amended   complaint  against  appellees,\n\nPolaroid  Corporation,  Israel   Booth,  William  Graney  and\n\nVincent Tognarelli, to recover damages for alleged violations\n\nof  the Racketeer  Influenced and  Corrupt  Organizations Act\n\n[RICO],  18  U.S.C.     1964(c),  and  the  grant of  summary\n\njudgment  to  Graney  and  Tognarelli  on  appellant's  claim\n\nseeking relief for alleged violations   101(a)(2)  of Title I\n\nof the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure  Act [LMRDA]\n\n(codified at 29 U.S.C.   411(a)(2)).  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n\n     In  1946, Polaroid  established the  Polaroid Employees'\n\nCommittee  [the committee]  to enhance  communication between\n\nemployees and management.   Although its members were elected\n\nby  the employees, the committee was  treated as a department\n\nof Polaroid.  Polaroid paid salaries to the committee members\n\nand funded  all  committee activities.   From  1983 to  1992,\n\nPolaroid  registered the committee as a \"labor organization,\"\n\npursuant to 29  U.S.C.    432.  Appellee  Graney was  elected\n\nChairman of the  committee in 1989.  Appellee  Tognarelli was\n\nelected Vice Chairman the same  year.  Appellant Scivally was\n\nelected  to the  committee  as a  representative in  February\n\n1992.\n\n     Upon  her  election,  Scivally  sought  to  render   the\n\ncommittee   \"more  responsive  to  its  membership  and  less\n\n                             -2-\n\nsubservient to  employer Polaroid.\"  After  failing to reform\n\nthe  committee from within,  Scivally filed a  claim with the\n\nDepartment  of  Labor  [DOL]  asserting  that  the  committee\n\nofficers  had been elected in  violation of 29  U.S.C.   481.\n\nIn  June 1992,  the DOL  made preliminary  findings that  the\n\nmanner  of  electing  the committee  officers  was  improper.\n\nThereupon, Booth,  the President and Chief  Executive Officer\n\nof Polaroid,  announced the committee was  dissolved.  Graney\n\nand Tognarelli  in turn  filed a \"terminal  report\" notifying\n\nthe DOL that the committee has been dissolved.  See 29 C.F.R.\n                                                   \n\n   402.5.  Upon receipt  of the report,  the DOL discontinued\n\nits investigation and dismissed  Scivally's complaint on  the\n\nground  there  was no  longer  an entity  falling  within the\n\nSecretary's jurisdiction to investigate.   Scivally filed her\n\ncomplaint in the district court on July 9, 1992.\n\n                              II\n\n     Scivally's RICO claims are predicated on her  allegation\n\nthat Polaroid and Booth acted illegally by paying \"bribes\" in\n\nthe form of salaries and other payments to the members of the\n\ncommittee, in violation of  29 U.S.C.   186(a).   She alleges\n\nthat Graney and Tognarelli  illegally accepted the bribes, in\n\nviolation  of  29  U.S.C.     186(b).1    Since  the payments\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 186(a)  provides, inter  alia, that \"it  shall be\n                                         \nunlawful for any employer  . . . to pay  . . . any money  . .\n.(3) to any employee or group or committee of employees . . .\nfor  the purpose of causing such employees . . . to influence\nany  other employees in the exercise of the right to organize\n\n                             -3-\n\noccurred over  several years, appellant alleges  a pattern of\n\nracketeering  activity.    She  asserts  five  categories  of\n\ninjuries:  (1) lost  wages and  benefits the  committee would\n\nhave negotiated if it had been free from employer domination;\n\n(2) financial loss from an  employee stock option plan [ESOP]\n\nin which she would not have participated if the committee had\n\nnot been employer  dominated; (3) lost opportunity to run for\n\noffice and vote in union  elections; (4) lost opportunity  to\n\nexercise her rights  as a member of a union  under Title I of\n\nthe  LMRDA; and (5) the  loss of her  position as a committee\n\nrepresentative.  The district  court dismissed all the counts\n\nfor lack of standing.\n\n     In order  to establish standing under  RICO, a plaintiff\n\nmust demonstrate that  she was \"injured in  h[er] business or\n\nproperty\" by  the alleged racketeering activity,  18 U.S.C.  \n\n1964(c), and that  the injury was  proximately caused by  the\n\nillegal  activity, Holmes  v. Securities  Investor Protection\n                                                             \n\nCorp., 112  S.Ct. 1311,  1316-22 (1992).    To establish  the\n    \n\nrequisite proximate  cause, a RICO plaintiff  must show \"some\n\ndirect relation between the injury asserted and the injurious\n\nconduct.\"   Id. at 1318.  Since Scivally has failed to allege\n              \n\n                    \n\nand bargain collectively through representatives of their own\nchoosing;  or (4)  to  any officer  or  employee of  a  labor\norganization . . . with intent to influence him in respect to\nany of his actions, decisions, or  duties as a representative\nof employees or  as such  officer or employee  of such  labor\norganization.\"   Section 186(b)  makes it unlawful  to accept\nany payment prohibited by subsection (a).\n\n                             -4-\n\nsufficient facts  to show that her  injuries were proximately\n\ncaused  (or in  some  cases caused  at  all) by  the  alleged\n\nillegal activity of appellees, we affirm the dismissal of her\n\nRICO complaints.\n\n     Scivally's complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to\n\nestablish  that   appellees'  pattern  of  bribery   was  the\n\nproximate  cause of any loss of wages and/or benefits to her.\n\nHer  assumption that, if  the committee had  not existed, the\n\nemployees would have established an independent  labor union,\n\nand that this union  would have negotiated a better  wage and\n\nbenefit package than  the employees in fact obtained,  is too\n\nindirect and speculative to satisfy the standard of proximate\n\ncause.   See, e.g.,  Associated General Contractors,  Inc. v.\n                                                         \n\nCalifornia  State Council  of Carpenters,  459 U.S.  519, 542\n                                        \n\n(1983)   (plaintiff   whose   injuries  were   indirect   and\n\nspeculative  does not have standing to sue under section 4 of\n\nthe  Clayton  Act)  (applying  traditional   proximate  cause\n\nstandards);  Holmes, 112  S.Ct.  at 1317  (reasoning used  to\n                   \n\nrequire  showing  of  proximate cause  in  Associated General\n                                                             \n\nContractors  \"applies   just  as  readily  to      1964(c)\").\n           \n\nScivally's  alternate  contention--that  the employees  would\n\nhave obtained better wages if no employee organization of any\n\nsort had existed--is similarly indirect and speculative.\n\n     Scivally  also alleges  that  she was  \"cheated\" out  of\n\nwages  and benefits by Polaroid's  adoption of an  ESOP.  The\n\n                             -5-\n\nESOP was established as a defense  against a hostile takeover\n\nattempt and its propriety  was challenged before the Delaware\n\nCourt  of  Chancery.   Shamrock  Holdings,  Inc. v.  Polaroid\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  559 A.2d 257 (Del. Ch. 1989).  Scivally contends that\n    \n\nPolaroid used its control over the committee to induce Graney\n\nand Tognarelli  to testify falsely before  the Delaware court\n\nabout  employee  sentiment  toward  the ESOP  and  that  this\n\ntestimony led the  court to  approve the ESOP.   She  alleges\n\nspecifically  that Graney  and  Tognarelli falsely  testified\n\nthat Polaroid  employees would work more  productively if the\n\nESOP were adopted.  \n\n     The  record  belies  Scivally's   claim.    First,   the\n\ntestimony of Graney and Tognarelli was only a small  fraction\n\nof  the evidence on which the Delaware court relied in making\n\nits findings.   Id. at 259 (in  making its summary of factual\n                  \n\nfindings  court   drew  \"from  over  3,000   pages  of  trial\n\ntranscript,  more than  500  exhibits and  extensive excerpts\n\nfrom the  depositions of 34 witnesses\").  Moreover, the court\n\ndid not find  that the ESOP  would increase productivity  but\n\nonly that it would not lead to \"decreased productivity.\"  Id.\n                                                            \n\nat 272.   Given these undisputed facts,  Scivally cannot show\n\nthat the allegedly perjured testimony was the proximate cause\n\nfor  the  court's  failure  to  set  aside  the  ESOP.    See\n                                                             \n\nAssociated  General  Contractors,  459  U.S.  at  542  (since\n                                \n\nalleged  injuries  may  have  been  produced  by  independent\n\n                             -6-\n\nfactors, plaintiff has not shown they were proximately caused\n\nby defendant's acts).\n\n     Scivally alleges  that the other  injuries she  suffered\n\nstem from the dissolution  of the committee.  Insofar  as the\n\ndissolution  marked  the  cessation  of   appellees'  alleged\n\nracketeering   activity,  any   injury   suffered  from   the\n\ndissolution was not caused by racketeering activity.  \n\n     Scivally, however,  also  alleges that  the  dissolution\n\nitself  could  not have  occurred  but  for the  racketeering\n\nactivity of appellees Booth, Graney and  Tognarelli.  Even if\n\nthis were so, appellant  cannot show that she was  injured in\n\nher business or property by the dissolution of the committee.\n\nAccording to  appellant's allegations, the committee  had for\n\nseveral years been funded  by the company in violation  of 29\n\nU.S.C.    186(a)  &amp;  (b).    Since  the  committee  had  been\n\nsupported by  the very racketeering activity  which forms the\n\npredicate acts of appellant's RICO complaint, the property to\n\nwhich Scivally alleges  injury--her rights to  participate in\n\nthe  committee--would  not  have existed  absent  the illegal\n\nracketeering activity.  \"Where, as here, the only property to\n\nwhich a  plaintiff alleges injury is  an expectation interest\n\nthat  would  not  have  existed  but  for  the  alleged  RICO\n\nviolation,  it would  defy logic  to conclude  the [causation\n\n                             -7-\n\nrequisite  to confer  RICO  standing] exists.\"2   Heinold  v.\n                                                         \n\nPerlstein, 651 F. Supp. 1410, 1412 (E.D. Pa. 1987) (plaintiff\n         \n\nwho  entered  into  contract  because  of  allegedly  illegal\n\nactivity of  defendant cannot  recover  for injury  sustained\n\nbecause he lost the benefit of the bargain).\n\n                             III\n\n     Scivally  alleges that  appellees Graney  and Tognarelli\n\nviolated her right to free  speech and assembly, pursuant  to\n\n29  U.S.C.    411(a)(2),3 when  they dissolved  the committee\n\nwithout  consulting  its  membership.    The  district  court\n\ngranted summary judgment to defendants.\n\n     Scivally cannot prevail on her   411(a)(2) claim because\n\nshe  cannot  show  that  the  dissolution  of  the  committee\n\ninterfered with any  right she possessed to  speak freely and\n\nassociate  with  other  members  of   a  labor  organization.\n\nScivally  alleges  that  the  committee  as  it  existed  was\n\n                    \n\n2.  Similarly,  appellant  suffered no  cognizable  injury in\nbeing deprived of her rights to participate in an independent\nlabor organization prior to the dissolution of the committee.\nOn the  one hand,  absent the alleged  racketeering activity,\nthe  committee  would  not  have  existed.    On  the  other,\nappellant  has  alleged  no  facts which  would  support  the\nconclusion  that  but  for Polaroid's  establishment  of  the\ncommittee,  Polaroid  employees  would  have  established  an\nindependent labor union.  \n\n3.  According to 29 U.S.C.   411(a)(2):\n\n          Every member of  any labor organization  shall\n     have  the right  to meet  and assemble  freely with\n     other members; and to express any views, arguments,\n     or opinions . . .\n\n                             -8-\n\nemployer  dominated.     Employer  domination   of  a   labor\n\norganization is an  unfair labor practice in violation  of 29\n\nU.S.C.   158(a)(2).  Moreover, it has long been the policy of\n\nthe National  Labor Relations  Board [NLRB] that  an employer\n\ndominated  union must  be  disestablished.4    See  Carpenter\n                                                             \n\nSteel Co., 21 LLRM 1232, 1234 (1948)  (\"Where we find that an\n        \n\nemployer's unfair  labor practices have been  so extensive as\n\nto constitute domination of  the organization, we shall order\n\nits disestablishment . . . \") (stating NLRB policy); N.L.R.B.\n                                                            \n\nv.  Northeastern  Univ., 601  F.2d 1208,  1215 n.7  (1st Cir.\n                      \n\n1979) (\"the Board applies the theory that once domination has\n\nbeen shown, no remedy  short of complete disestablishment can\n\never be adequate\").  While not necessarily requiring that the\n\ncommittee be  dissolved, an order to  disestablish would have\n\nrequired that Polaroid \"cease to recognize [the committee] as\n\nthe collective bargaining representative of [its] employees,\"\n\nSwift &amp; Co.  v. N.L.R.B., 106 F.2d  87, 95 (10th Cir.  1939),\n                       \n\nand almost certainly would  have prevented the committee from\n\never being certified by the NLRB, see N.L.R.B. v. United Mine\n                                                             \n\nWorkers, 355  U.S. 453,  458 (1958) (upon  finding domination\n       \n\n\"Board usually  orders the  complete disestablishment  of the\n\nunion so that it can never be certified by the Board again\").\n\nIn other words, upon disestablishment, the committee would no\n\n                    \n\n4.  Scivally  concedes  that,  if  a  complaint  of  employer\ndomination had been  brought before the NLRB, the  NLRB would\nhave ordered the committee disestablished.\n\n                             -9-\n\nlonger have been a \"labor organization\" within the meaning of\n\n29 U.S.C.    402(i) &amp; (j).5  However, the rights protected by\n\n   411(a)(2), which  Scivally  alleges were  violated by  the\n\ndissolution,   belong   only   to   members   of   a   \"labor\n\norganization.\"      Therefore, on the basis of Scivally's own\n\nallegations, even if Graney  and Tognarelli had not dissolved\n\nthe committee,  the disestablishment  of the  committee would\n\nhave been  necessary  to cure  an  unfair practice  and  that\n\ndisestablishment would have  extinguished any rights Scivally\n\nhad under   411(a)(2).  Since Graney and Tognarelli cannot be\n\nsaid   to  have  violated  a  right  which  would  have  been\n\nextinguished regardless of whether  or not they dissolved the\n\n                    \n\n5.  According to  29 U.S.C.    401(i),  for  the purposes  of\nchapter 11 of Title 29:\n\n          \"Labor    organization\"    means    a    labor\n     organization  engaged  in  an   industry  affecting\n     commerce . . .\n\nAccording to   401(j): \n\n          A labor  organization shall  be  deemed to  be\n     engaged in an industry affecting commerce if it--\n\n            (1)  is  the  certified   representative  of\n          employees under the provisions of the National\n          Labor Relations Act . . . ; or\n            (2) although not certified, is a national or\n          international  labor  organization or  a local\n          labor organization recognized or acting as the\n          representative of employees of an  employer or\n          employers engaged in an industry affecting    \n          commerce. . . .\n\n                             -10-\n\ncommittee, it was appropriate to grant them summary judgment.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -11-\n",

Sec. 1964(c), and the grant of summary judgment to Graney and Tognarelli on appellant's claim seeking relief for alleged violations Sec. 101(a)(2) of Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act [LMRDA] (codified at 29 U.S.C. Sec. 411(a)(2)).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In 1946, Polaroid established the Polaroid Employees' Committee [the committee] to enhance communication between employees and management.  Although its members were elected by the employees, the committee was treated as a department of Polaroid.  Polaroid paid salaries to the committee members and funded all committee activities.  From 1983 to 1992, Polaroid registered the committee as a \"labor organization,\" pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 432.  Appellee Graney was elected Chairman of the committee in 1989.  Appellee Tognarelli was elected Vice Chairman the same year.  Appellant Scivally was elected to the committee as a representative in February 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon her election, Scivally sought to render the committee \"more responsive to its membership and less subservient to employer Polaroid.\"  After failing to reform the committee from within, Scivally filed a claim with the Department of Labor [DOL] asserting that the committee officers had been elected in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 481.  In June 1992, the DOL made preliminary findings that the manner of electing the committee officers was improper.  Thereupon, Booth, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Polaroid, announced the committee was dissolved.  Graney and Tognarelli in turn filed a \"terminal report\" notifying the DOL that the committee has been dissolved.  See 29 C.F.R. Sec. 402.5.  Upon receipt of the report, the DOL discontinued its investigation and dismissed Scivally's complaint on the ground there was no longer an entity falling within the Secretary's jurisdiction to investigate.  Scivally filed her complaint in the district court on July 9, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally's RICO claims are predicated on her allegation that Polaroid and Booth acted illegally by paying \"bribes\" in the form of salaries and other payments to the members of the committee, in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 186(a).  She alleges that Graney and Tognarelli illegally accepted the bribes, in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 186(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Since the payments occurred over several years, appellant alleges a pattern of racketeering activity.  She asserts five categories of injuries:  (1) lost wages and benefits the committee would have negotiated if it had been free from employer domination;  (2) financial loss from an employee stock option plan [ESOP] in which she would not have participated if the committee had not been employer dominated;  (3) lost opportunity to run for office and vote in union elections;  (4) lost opportunity to exercise her rights as a member of a union under Title I of the LMRDA;  and (5) the loss of her position as a committee representative.  The district court dismissed all the counts for lack of standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish standing under RICO, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she was \"injured in h[er] business or property\" by the alleged racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c), and that the injury was proximately caused by the illegal activity,  Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 112 S.Ct. 1311, 1316-22 (1992).  To establish the requisite proximate cause, a RICO plaintiff must show \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct.\"   Id. at 1318.  Since Scivally has failed to allege sufficient facts to show that her injuries were proximately caused (or in some cases caused at all) by the alleged illegal activity of appellees, we affirm the dismissal of her RICO complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally's complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to establish that appellees' pattern of bribery was the proximate cause of any loss of wages and/or benefits to her.  Her assumption that, if the committee had not existed, the employees would have established an independent labor union, and that this union would have negotiated a better wage and benefit package than the employees in fact obtained, is too indirect and speculative to satisfy the standard of proximate cause.  See, e.g., Associated General Contractors, Inc. v.  California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 542 (1983) (plaintiff whose injuries were indirect and speculative does not have standing to sue under section 4 of the Clayton Act) (applying traditional proximate cause standards);   Holmes, 112 S.Ct. at 1317 (reasoning used to require showing of proximate cause in Associated General Contractors \"applies just as readily to Sec. 1964(c)\").  Scivally's alternate contention-that the employees would have obtained better wages if no employee organization of any sort had existed-is similarly indirect and speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally also alleges that she was \"cheated\" out of wages and benefits by Polaroid's adoption of an ESOP.  The ESOP was established as a defense against a hostile takeover attempt and its propriety was challenged before the Delaware Court of Chancery.   Shamrock Holdings, Inc. v. Polaroid Corp., 559 A.2d 257 (Del.  Ch. 1989).  Scivally contends that Polaroid used its control over the committee to induce Graney and Tognarelli to testify falsely before the Delaware court about employee sentiment toward the ESOP and that this testimony led the court to approve the ESOP.  She alleges specifically that Graney and Tognarelli falsely testified that Polaroid employees would work more productively if the ESOP were adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record belies Scivally's claim.  First, the testimony of Graney and Tognarelli was only a small fraction of the evidence on which the Delaware court relied in making its findings.   Id. at 259 (in making its summary of factual findings court drew \"from over 3,000 pages of trial transcript, more than 500 exhibits and extensive excerpts from the depositions of 34 witnesses\").  Moreover, the court did not find that the ESOP would increase productivity but only that it would not lead to \"decreased productivity.\"   Id. at 272.  Given these undisputed facts, Scivally cannot show that the allegedly perjured testimony was the proximate cause for the court's failure to set aside the ESOP.   See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542 (since alleged injuries may have been produced by independent factors, plaintiff has not shown they were proximately caused by defendant's acts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally alleges that the other injuries she suffered stem from the dissolution of the committee.  Insofar as the dissolution marked the cessation of appellees' alleged racketeering activity, any injury suffered from the dissolution was not caused by racketeering activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally, however, also alleges that the dissolution itself could not have occurred but for the racketeering activity of appellees Booth, Graney and Tognarelli.  Even if this were so, appellant cannot show that she was injured in her business or property by the dissolution of the committee.  According to appellant's allegations, the committee had for several years been funded by the company in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 186(a) &amp; (b).  Since the committee had been supported by the very racketeering activity which forms the predicate acts of appellant's RICO complaint, the property to which Scivally alleges injury-her rights to participate in the committee-would not have existed absent the illegal racketeering activity.  \"Where, as here, the only property to which a plaintiff alleges injury is an expectation interest that would not have existed but for the alleged RICO violation, it would defy logic to conclude the [causation requisite to confer RICO standing] exists.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Heinold v. Perlstein, 651 F. Supp. 1410, 1412 (E.D. Pa. 1987) (plaintiff who entered into contract because of allegedly illegal activity of defendant cannot recover for injury sustained because he lost the benefit of the bargain).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally alleges that appellees Graney and Tognarelli violated her right to free speech and assembly, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 411(a)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> when they dissolved the committee without consulting its membership.  The district court granted summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally cannot prevail on her Sec. 411(a)(2) claim because she cannot show that the dissolution of the committee interfered with any right she possessed to speak freely and associate with other members of a labor organization.  Scivally alleges that the committee as it existed was employer dominated.  Employer domination of a labor organization is an unfair labor practice in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(2).  Moreover, it has long been the policy of the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] that an employer dominated union must be disestablished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Carpenter Steel Co., 21 LLRM 1232, 1234 (1948) (\"Where we find that an employer's unfair labor practices have been so extensive as to constitute domination of the organization, we shall order its disestablishment ... \") (stating NLRB policy);   N.L.R.B. v. Northeastern Univ., 601 F.2d 1208, 1215 n. 7 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"the Board applies the theory that once domination has been shown, no remedy short of complete disestablishment can ever be adequate\").  While not necessarily requiring that the committee be dissolved, an order to disestablish would have required that Polaroid \"cease to recognize [the committee] as the collective bargaining representative of [its] employees,\"  Swift &amp; Co. v. N.L.R.B., 106 F.2d 87, 95 (10th Cir. 1939), and almost certainly would have prevented the committee from ever being certified by the NLRB,  see N.L.R.B. v. United Mine Workers, 355 U.S. 453, 458 (1958) (upon finding domination \"Board usually orders the complete disestablishment of the union so that it can never be certified by the Board again\").  In other words, upon disestablishment, the committee would no longer have been a \"labor organization\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 402(i) &amp; (j).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, the rights protected by Sec. 411(a)(2), which Scivally alleges were violated by the dissolution, belong only to members of a \"labor organization.\"  Therefore, on the basis of Scivally's own allegations, even if Graney and Tognarelli had not dissolved the committee, the disestablishment of the committee would have been necessary to cure an unfair practice and that disestablishment would have extinguished any rights Scivally had under Sec. 411(a)(2).  Since Graney and Tognarelli cannot be said to have violated a right which would have been extinguished regardless of whether or not they dissolved the committee, it was appropriate to grant them summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 186(a) provides, inter alia, that \"it shall be unlawful for any employer ... to pay ... any money ...

Pa. 1987) (plaintiff who entered into contract because of allegedly illegal activity of defendant cannot recover for injury sustained because he lost the benefit of the bargain).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally alleges that appellees Graney and Tognarelli violated her right to free speech and assembly, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 411(a)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> when they dissolved the committee without consulting its membership.  The district court granted summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scivally cannot prevail on her Sec. 411(a)(2) claim because she cannot show that the dissolution of the committee interfered with any right she possessed to speak freely and associate with other members of a labor organization.  Scivally alleges that the committee as it existed was employer dominated.  Employer domination of a labor organization is an unfair labor practice in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 158(a)(2).  Moreover, it has long been the policy of the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] that an employer dominated union must be disestablished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Carpenter Steel Co., 21 LLRM 1232, 1234 (1948) (\"Where we find that an employer's unfair labor practices have been so extensive as to constitute domination of the organization, we shall order its disestablishment ... \") (stating NLRB policy);   N.L.R.B. v. Northeastern Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368185\"><a href=\"/opinion/368185/national-labor-relations-board-v-northeastern-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span>, 1215 n. 7 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"the Board applies the theory that once domination has been shown, no remedy short of complete disestablishment can ever be adequate\").  While not necessarily requiring that the committee be dissolved, an order to disestablish would have required that Polaroid \"cease to recognize [the committee] as the collective bargaining representative of [its] employees,\"  Swift &amp; Co. v. N.L.R.B., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494460\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494460/swift-co-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 95 (10th Cir. 1939), and almost certainly would have prevented the committee from ever being certified by the NLRB,  see N.L.R.B. v. United Mine Workers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105626\"><a href=\"/opinion/105626/nlrb-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 458 (1958) (upon finding domination \"Board usually orders the complete disestablishment of the union so that it can never be certified by the Board again\").  In other words, upon disestablishment, the committee would no longer have been a \"labor organization\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 402(i) &amp; (j).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, the rights protected by Sec. 411(a)(2), which Scivally alleges were violated by the dissolution, belong only to members of a \"labor organization.\"  Therefore, on the basis of Scivally's own allegations, even if Graney and Tognarelli had not dissolved the committee, the disestablishment of the committee would have been necessary to cure an unfair practice and that disestablishment would have extinguished any rights Scivally had under Sec. 411(a)(2).  Since Graney and Tognarelli cannot be said to have violated a right which would have been extinguished regardless of whether or not they dissolved the committee, it was appropriate to grant them summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 186(a) provides, inter alia, that \"it shall be unlawful for any employer ... to pay ... any money ...
