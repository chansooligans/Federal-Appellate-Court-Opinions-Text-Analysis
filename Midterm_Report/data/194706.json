Angel  Lopez Rodriguez  appeals the\n                     \n\njudgment  of the district court affirming a final decision of\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (\"Secretary\") that\n\nappellant  did not  meet the  disability requirements  of the\n\nSocial Security Act.\n\n          Appellant's  application,  filed  April  13,  1989,\n\nalleged  an inability  to  work beginning  October 15,  1984.\n\nBecause   of   an  earlier   disposition   of   his  previous\n\napplications,  the period of  alleged disability under review\n\nhere  begins October 1, 1987 and ends December 31, 1989, when\n\nappellant's   insured   status   expired.1      The   current\n\napplication was denied, appealed, and  denied again.  After a\n\nde novo  hearing, the Administrative Law  Judge (\"ALJ\") found\n       \n\nthat  appellant had  a residual  functional capacity  for the\n\nfull range of light and sedentary work, and so was  not under\n\na  disability as  defined in  the Act.   The  Appeals Council\n\ndenied  review.  An appeal  was taken to  the district court,\n\nwhere  a  magistrate-judge  concluded  that  the  Secretary's\n\ndecision was supported by  substantial evidence.   Objections\n\nto  the magistrate's  report  were rejected  by the  district\n\ncourt  judge in a lengthy  opinion.  The  district court also\n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellant  filed two  previous applications  alleging the\nsame  onset date.   The  earlier applications were  denied on\nSeptember 30, 1987.   The denial was affirmed by  the Appeals\nCouncil, and no further  appeal was taken.  There  appears to\nbe no  colorable  challenge  here  to the  finality  of  that\ndecision.  Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977); Dvareckas\n                                                             \nv. Secretary of HHS, 804 F.2d 770 (1st Cir. 1986).\n                   \n\n                             -2-\n\nadopted  the  magistrate's  findings  and   report  in  full,\n\naffirming the Secretary's decision.   We, too, affirm.\n\n          Appellant  claimed an  inability to  work due  to a\n\nnervous condition, and heart and back problems accompanied by\n\nsevere pain.   Applying  the sequential analysis  required by\n\nthe   regulations,  the   ALJ  found   that  in   combination\n\nappellant's conditions were  severe, but they did not meet or\n\nequal any of the listed  impairments. 20 C.F.R.     404.1520,\n\n404.1520a.  Appellant's  conditions, nevertheless, were found\n\nto  prevent him from returning to his past relevant work as a\n\ntruck driver.\n\n          Appellant does not dispute  the above findings.  He\n\ntakes issue, however,  with the ALJ's  finding at step  five,\n\nthat despite  his conditions, he has  the residual functional\n\ncapacity to engage in  the full range of unskilled  light and\n\nsedentary jobs  available in  the economy.   Appellant argues\n\nthat  the ALJ  mistakenly  determined that  appellant had  no\n\nobjective medical  impairment  likely  to  cause  the  severe\n\ndegree of  pain alleged,  improperly weighed the  testimonial\n\nevidence of pain, and erred in relying on 20 C.F.R. Part 404,\n\nSupt.  P, App.  2, Tables  1, 2 (the  \"grid\"), rather  than a\n\nvocational expert.  \n\n          Our  standard of review  is whether the Secretary's\n\nfindings are  supported by  \"substantial evidence.\"   We will\n\naffirm the  Secretary, \"if  a reasonable mind,  reviewing the\n\n                             -3-\n\nevidence  in  the  record as  a  whole,  could  accept it  as\n\nadequate to support  his conclusion.\"  Ortiz v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHHS,  955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Rodriguez v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of HHS, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981)).2 \n                \n\n           We have no difficulty finding  substantial support\n\nin  the record  for  the ALJ's  resolution  of the  purported\n\nconflicts  in the medical evidence.   As to appellant's heart\n\ncondition, the record shows that  appellant began complaining\n\nof chest pain of an unknown origin in March, 1988.  Diagnoses\n\nincluded arthralgia, controlled  hypertension and chest  wall\n\nsyndrome.   Although an  initial  electrocardiogram showed  a\n\nfirst degree atrioventricular block leading to a diagnosis of\n\nangina, three later electrocardiograms and a stress test were\n\nnormal.     The  ALJ's  conclusion  that   appellant's  chest\n\ncondition  was  not ischemic  in  nature  was thus  logically\n\ndictated by the medical findings and tests in the record.  \n\n          There  was  a  somewhat  starker  conflict  in  the\n\nevidence relating to  appellant's back condition.   Appellant\n\nwas treated by a chiropractor between December, 1988 and May,\n\n1989.   The  chiropractor  reported that  appellant showed  a\n\nlimited range of motion  and severe pain in the  cervical and\n\nlumbar areas, muscle spasm, poor motor function in his  arms,\n\n                    \n\n2.  The ALJ's  and  magistrate's reports  well summarize  the\nlengthy  record,  which  includes a  miscellany  of  physical\ncomplaints and  medical reports.   We recap  here only  those\nrecord parts necessary to our decision.\n\n                             -4-\n\na fair ability to walk on heels and toes and  stiff gait, but\n\nnormal reflexes  and no atrophy.   The chiropractor diagnosed\n\nan unstable lower back  and possible discogenic disease, with\n\na poor prognosis.  \n\n          By  contrast, a  consulting internist  who examined\n\nappellant in June, 1989 reported observing normal joints with\n\nno  swelling, tenderness  nor  decreased range  of motion,  a\n\nnormal  gait,  coordination  and  reflexes.   X-rays  of  the\n\ncervical  spine were also  normal, reflecting  preserved disk\n\nspaces.   Lumbar region  lateral flexion was  normal, forward\n\nflexion was reported  to be a full 90 degrees,  but with some\n\npain.    The  internist  diagnosed  back  pain  secondary  to\n\nparavertebral muscle spasm. \n\n           The ALJ fully credited the internist's report.  He\n\ndeclined  to  assign  controlling  weight   to  the  treating\n\nchiropractor's  diagnoses because  they were  contradicted by\n\nthe  other  substantial  objective  medical  evidence  in the\n\nrecord,   including  x-rays.    He  carefully  explained  his\n\nconclusions  as  required by  the  regulations.  20 C.F.R.   \n\n404.1527(d)(2) (1991).    We have  no  doubt that  the  ALJ's\n\nresolution  of these  conflicts  was  reasonable, within  his\n\ncompetence, and  amply supported  by the record.   Rodriguez,\n                                                            \n\n647 F.2d at 222.     \n\n          As  to  appellant's   nervous  condition,  the  ALJ\n\nconcluded that it placed no limitation on appellant's ability\n\n                             -5-\n\nto  work.   This conclusion  was also  well supported  by the\n\nmedical  evidence.    Appellant  had  been  referred  by  his\n\nattorneys  to a mental health center in March, 1989, where he\n\nwas  diagnosed as  suffering  from a  mild anxiety  disorder.\n\nAfter  small  doses  of Vistaril  were  prescribed, appellant\n\nreportedly remained  stable and improved.   The diagnosis was\n\nconfirmed  by  later  evaluations   in  which  appellant  was\n\nrepeatedly   described  as  oriented,   alert,  coherent  and\n\nrelevant,  having   adequate  logic,  judgment   and  memory.\n\nAlthough it  was noted  that appellant had  slight difficulty\n\nmaintaining    social    functioning,   concentration,    and\n\npersistence of pace, two residual mental capacity assessments\n\nconcluded that  he retains  the abilities to  perform routine\n\nwork  tasks  and  to   cope  with  the  demands  of   a  work\n\nenvironment.   These assessments are sufficient  to show that\n\nappellant's mental  capacity to engage in  unskilled or semi-\n\nskilled sedentary work remains intact.   See Ortiz, 955  F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 769-70. \n\n          In  sum,   the  record  amply  supports  the  ALJ's\n\ndetermination that the credible  diagnoses failed to show any\n\nobjective medical  impairment reasonably associated  with the\n\nsevere  degree  of pain  and functional  limitations alleged.\n\nMoreover,  there  were no  reports  of  any other  clinically\n\nverifiable symptoms of severe pain.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We also find  no error in  the ALJ's evaluation  of\n\nappellant's subjective  complaints  of pain.   In  accordance\n\nwith the guidelines set  forth in Avery v. Secretary  of HHS,\n                                                            \n\n797  F.2d  19,  21  (1st  Cir.  1986),  the  ALJ   considered\n\nappellant's testimony in light  of the other record evidence.\n\nAppellant described his current  pain as radiating from under\n\nthe armpit  and back;  said that  his vertebral column  feels\n\ncrooked, and his arms  feel dead.  He also  described strong,\n\nsharp  chest pain,  accompanied  by nausea  and shortness  of\n\nbreath,  at  times  so   severe  that  he  claimed   to  lose\n\nconsciousness.    And he  testified  to  feelings of  extreme\n\nanxiety and palpitations, as well as difficulty sleeping.   \n\n          As   the   ALJ   noted,    appellant's   subjective\n\ndescription  was  corroborated  by neither  medical  nor  lay\n\nobservations.   In three visits  to the District  Office, and\n\nduring  the residual  mental capacity  evaluations, appellant\n\nshowed  no signs  of  any impairment  consistent with  severe\n\npain.   The ALJ noted, as background, that shortly before the\n\ncurrent  disability period,  appellant himself  had described\n\nhis  daily activities  as  watching  television, reading  the\n\npapers  and   the  Bible,  going  to   church  almost  daily,\n\noccasionally visiting the sick, and driving about three times\n\na week.  At the instant hearing, appellant testified, for the\n\nmost  part,  to  more  limited  daily  activities,  but  also\n\n                             -7-\n\nmentioned  some  activities which  seemingly would  require a\n\nhigh degree of exertion.3\n\n          We  necessarily defer  to  the ALJ's  evaluation of\n\nappellant's  credibility, especially where it is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence  and specific  findings.  Frustaglia  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of HHS, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).  The ALJ\n                \n\ncredited appellant's  subjective complaints  of pain  only to\n\nthe extent consistent  with the medical evidence,  indicating\n\nthe  existence  of  mild  pain.    Although  the  appellant's\n\ncombination of conditions precluded his returning to his past\n\nrelevant work  as truck  driver, the ALJ  further found  that\n\nappellant retained the  capacity to engage in  the full range\n\nof light and sedentary work.     \n\n          Although  we have  not  located in  the record  any\n\nresidual  functional capacity  assessments, other  than those\n\nassociated  with appellant's mental  impairment, we think the\n\nALJ made a competent, commonsense judgment about  appellant's\n\nexertional functional capacity based on the medical findings.\n\nSee Gordils v. Secretary of HHS, 921 F.2d 327 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                               \n\n(although ALJ is ordinarily  not qualified to assess residual\n\nfunctional capacity based  on bare medical record,  he may do\n\nso as  long as he does  not overstep the boundaries  of a lay\n\n                    \n\n3.  Although appellant stated that he  spent much of his time\nin  bed or in a hammock due  to weakness and pain, when asked\nabout his  personal relationships he mentioned  that not long\nago,  when his \"blood pressure went up,\" he took a hammer and\nbroke a door.  \n\n                             -8-\n\nperson's  competence); Perez  v. Secretary  of HHS,  958 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n445,  446 (1st Cir. 1991)  (a finding that  claimant does not\n\nsuffer  from  any  impairment posing  significant  exertional\n\nrestrictions would obviate the need for medical assessment of\n\nexertional residual functional capacity). \n\n          In  Gordils,   we  upheld   a  lay   fact  finder's\n                     \n\nconclusion that a diagnosis of \"weaker back\" did not preclude\n\nsedentary work.   There we said we might be troubled by a lay\n\nfact finder's opinion that a claimant was capable of the more\n\nphysically demanding efforts required by light work.  In this\n\ncase, however, we need not pause to consider the ALJ's \"light\n\nwork\"   conclusion,  because   his  alternate   finding  that\n\nappellant was  \"not disabled\" from performing  the full range\n\nof sedentary work  was, on  the basis of  the medical  record\n\nbefore us, well within the ALJ's competence.\n\n          Accordingly, we also  reject appellant's  challenge\n\nto the use  of the grid instead  of reliance on a  vocational\n\nexpert.  Rodriguez-Pagan v.  Secretary of HHS, 819 F.2d  1, 3\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988).  The ALJ\n                             \n\nconsulted the  grid only  after determining  that appellant's\n\nalleged  non-exertional  impairments  did  not  significantly\n\naffect his ability to engage in the full range of work in the\n\nsedentary jobs   category.   Considering appellant's  age (46\n\nyears old),  education (7th grade level)  and work experience\n\n(semi-skilled,  non-transferrable  skills), the  ALJ properly\n\n                             -9-\n\nreached  the alternate  conclusion  that the  grid directs  a\n\nfinding of \"not  disabled\".   20 C.F.R. Part  404, Subpt.  P,\n\nApp. 2, Table 1, Rule 201.19.  There thus was no prejudice in\n\nthe ALJ's  failure to  ask  the vocational  expert about  how\n\nplaintiff's  non-exertional  impairments  might   affect  his\n\nability to perform light or sedentary work.\n\n          For  the  reasons  stated,   the  judgment  of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                             -10-\n",

Angel  Lopez Rodriguez  appeals the\n                     \n\njudgment  of the district court affirming a final decision of\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (\"Secretary\") that\n\nappellant  did not  meet the  disability requirements  of the\n\nSocial Security Act.\n\n          Appellant's  application,  filed  April  13,  1989,\n\nalleged  an inability  to  work beginning  October 15,  1984.\n\nBecause   of   an  earlier   disposition   of   his  previous\n\napplications,  the period of  alleged disability under review\n\nhere  begins October 1, 1987 and ends December 31, 1989, when\n\nappellant's   insured   status   expired.1      The   current\n\napplication was denied, appealed, and  denied again.  After a\n\nde novo  hearing, the Administrative Law  Judge (\"ALJ\") found\n       \n\nthat  appellant had  a residual  functional capacity  for the\n\nfull range of light and sedentary work, and so was  not under\n\na  disability as  defined in  the Act.   The  Appeals Council\n\ndenied  review.  An appeal  was taken to  the district court,\n\nwhere  a  magistrate-judge  concluded  that  the  Secretary's\n\ndecision was supported by  substantial evidence.   Objections\n\nto  the magistrate's  report  were rejected  by the  district\n\ncourt  judge in a lengthy  opinion.  The  district court also\n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellant  filed two  previous applications  alleging the\nsame  onset date.   The  earlier applications were  denied on\nSeptember 30, 1987.   The denial was affirmed by  the Appeals\nCouncil, and no further  appeal was taken.  There  appears to\nbe no  colorable  challenge  here  to the  finality  of  that\ndecision.  Califano v.

We, too, affirm.\n\n          Appellant  claimed an  inability to  work due  to a\n\nnervous condition, and heart and back problems accompanied by\n\nsevere pain.   Applying  the sequential analysis  required by\n\nthe   regulations,  the   ALJ  found   that  in   combination\n\nappellant's conditions were  severe, but they did not meet or\n\nequal any of the listed  impairments. 20 C.F.R.     404.1520,\n\n404.1520a.  Appellant's  conditions, nevertheless, were found\n\nto  prevent him from returning to his past relevant work as a\n\ntruck driver.\n\n          Appellant does not dispute  the above findings.  He\n\ntakes issue, however,  with the ALJ's  finding at step  five,\n\nthat despite  his conditions, he has  the residual functional\n\ncapacity to engage in  the full range of unskilled  light and\n\nsedentary jobs  available in  the economy.   Appellant argues\n\nthat  the ALJ  mistakenly  determined that  appellant had  no\n\nobjective medical  impairment  likely  to  cause  the  severe\n\ndegree of  pain alleged,  improperly weighed the  testimonial\n\nevidence of pain, and erred in relying on 20 C.F.R.

As to appellant's heart\n\ncondition, the record shows that  appellant began complaining\n\nof chest pain of an unknown origin in March, 1988.  Diagnoses\n\nincluded arthralgia, controlled  hypertension and chest  wall\n\nsyndrome.   Although an  initial  electrocardiogram showed  a\n\nfirst degree atrioventricular block leading to a diagnosis of\n\nangina, three later electrocardiograms and a stress test were\n\nnormal.     The  ALJ's  conclusion  that   appellant's  chest\n\ncondition  was  not ischemic  in  nature  was thus  logically\n\ndictated by the medical findings and tests in the record.  \n\n          There  was  a  somewhat  starker  conflict  in  the\n\nevidence relating to  appellant's back condition.   Appellant\n\nwas treated by a chiropractor between December, 1988 and May,\n\n1989.   The  chiropractor  reported that  appellant showed  a\n\nlimited range of motion  and severe pain in the  cervical and\n\nlumbar areas, muscle spasm, poor motor function in his  arms,\n\n                    \n\n2.  The ALJ's  and  magistrate's reports  well summarize  the\nlengthy  record,  which  includes a  miscellany  of  physical\ncomplaints and  medical reports.   We recap  here only  those\nrecord parts necessary to our decision.\n\n                             -4-\n\na fair ability to walk on heels and toes and  stiff gait, but\n\nnormal reflexes  and no atrophy.   The chiropractor diagnosed\n\nan unstable lower back  and possible discogenic disease, with\n\na poor prognosis.  \n\n          By  contrast, a  consulting internist  who examined\n\nappellant in June, 1989 reported observing normal joints with\n\nno  swelling, tenderness  nor  decreased range  of motion,  a\n\nnormal  gait,  coordination  and  reflexes.   X-rays  of  the\n\ncervical  spine were also  normal, reflecting  preserved disk\n\nspaces.   Lumbar region  lateral flexion was  normal, forward\n\nflexion was reported  to be a full 90 degrees,  but with some\n\npain.    The  internist  diagnosed  back  pain  secondary  to\n\nparavertebral muscle spasm. \n\n           The ALJ fully credited the internist's report.  He\n\ndeclined  to  assign  controlling  weight   to  the  treating\n\nchiropractor's  diagnoses because  they were  contradicted by\n\nthe  other  substantial  objective  medical  evidence  in the\n\nrecord,   including  x-rays.    He  carefully  explained  his\n\nconclusions  as  required by  the  regulations.  20 C.F.R.   \n\n404.1527(d)(2) (1991).    We have  no  doubt that  the  ALJ's\n\nresolution  of these  conflicts  was  reasonable, within  his\n\ncompetence, and  amply supported  by the record.   Rodriguez,\n                                                            \n\n647 F.2d at 222.     \n\n          As  to  appellant's   nervous  condition,  the  ALJ\n\nconcluded that it placed no limitation on appellant's ability\n\n                             -5-\n\nto  work.   This conclusion  was also  well supported  by the\n\nmedical  evidence.    Appellant  had  been  referred  by  his\n\nattorneys  to a mental health center in March, 1989, where he\n\nwas  diagnosed as  suffering  from a  mild anxiety  disorder.\n\nAfter  small  doses  of Vistaril  were  prescribed, appellant\n\nreportedly remained  stable and improved.   The diagnosis was\n\nconfirmed  by  later  evaluations   in  which  appellant  was\n\nrepeatedly   described  as  oriented,   alert,  coherent  and\n\nrelevant,  having   adequate  logic,  judgment   and  memory.\n\nAlthough it  was noted  that appellant had  slight difficulty\n\nmaintaining    social    functioning,   concentration,    and\n\npersistence of pace, two residual mental capacity assessments\n\nconcluded that  he retains  the abilities to  perform routine\n\nwork  tasks  and  to   cope  with  the  demands  of   a  work\n\nenvironment.   These assessments are sufficient  to show that\n\nappellant's mental  capacity to engage in  unskilled or semi-\n\nskilled sedentary work remains intact.   See Ortiz, 955  F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 769-70. \n\n          In  sum,   the  record  amply  supports  the  ALJ's\n\ndetermination that the credible  diagnoses failed to show any\n\nobjective medical  impairment reasonably associated  with the\n\nsevere  degree  of pain  and functional  limitations alleged.\n\nMoreover,  there  were no  reports  of  any other  clinically\n\nverifiable symptoms of severe pain.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We also find  no error in  the ALJ's evaluation  of\n\nappellant's subjective  complaints  of pain.   In  accordance\n\nwith the guidelines set  forth in Avery v. Secretary  of HHS,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  21  (1st  Cir.  1986),  the  ALJ   considered\n\nappellant's testimony in light  of the other record evidence.\n\nAppellant described his current  pain as radiating from under\n\nthe armpit  and back;  said that  his vertebral column  feels\n\ncrooked, and his arms  feel dead.  He also  described strong,\n\nsharp  chest pain,  accompanied  by nausea  and shortness  of\n\nbreath,  at  times  so   severe  that  he  claimed   to  lose\n\nconsciousness.    And he  testified  to  feelings of  extreme\n\nanxiety and palpitations, as well as difficulty sleeping.   \n\n          As   the   ALJ   noted,    appellant's   subjective\n\ndescription  was  corroborated  by neither  medical  nor  lay\n\nobservations.   In three visits  to the District  Office, and\n\nduring  the residual  mental capacity  evaluations, appellant\n\nshowed  no signs  of  any impairment  consistent with  severe\n\npain.   The ALJ noted, as background, that shortly before the\n\ncurrent  disability period,  appellant himself  had described\n\nhis  daily activities  as  watching  television, reading  the\n\npapers  and   the  Bible,  going  to   church  almost  daily,\n\noccasionally visiting the sick, and driving about three times\n\na week.  At the instant hearing, appellant testified, for the\n\nmost  part,  to  more  limited  daily  activities,  but  also\n\n                             -7-\n\nmentioned  some  activities which  seemingly would  require a\n\nhigh degree of exertion.3\n\n          We  necessarily defer  to  the ALJ's  evaluation of\n\nappellant's  credibility, especially where it is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence  and specific  findings.

The ALJ\n                \n\ncredited appellant's  subjective complaints  of pain  only to\n\nthe extent consistent  with the medical evidence,  indicating\n\nthe  existence  of  mild  pain.    Although  the  appellant's\n\ncombination of conditions precluded his returning to his past\n\nrelevant work  as truck  driver, the ALJ  further found  that\n\nappellant retained the  capacity to engage in  the full range\n\nof light and sedentary work.     \n\n          Although  we have  not  located in  the record  any\n\nresidual  functional capacity  assessments, other  than those\n\nassociated  with appellant's mental  impairment, we think the\n\nALJ made a competent, commonsense judgment about  appellant's\n\nexertional functional capacity based on the medical findings.\n\nSee Gordils v.

There we said we might be troubled by a lay\n\nfact finder's opinion that a claimant was capable of the more\n\nphysically demanding efforts required by light work.  In this\n\ncase, however, we need not pause to consider the ALJ's \"light\n\nwork\"   conclusion,  because   his  alternate   finding  that\n\nappellant was  \"not disabled\" from performing  the full range\n\nof sedentary work  was, on  the basis of  the medical  record\n\nbefore us, well within the ALJ's competence.\n\n          Accordingly, we also  reject appellant's  challenge\n\nto the use  of the grid instead  of reliance on a  vocational\n\nexpert.
