A  jury subsequently  convicted\n\nGendron of knowingly receiving child pornography through the\n\nmails.    18 U.S.C.     2252(a)(2).

Gendron points out\n\nthat  the  Ninth  Circuit has  interpreted  this  statute as\n\npermitting a  conviction of a  person who does not  know the\n                                                        \n\nchild-pornographic nature of the material received, and, for\n                         \n\nthat  reason, has  found it  unconstitutional.   See  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.

He says\n                        \n\nwe should do the same.\n\n          The Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Thomas, 893\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1066  (9th Cir.), cert.  denied, 498  U.S. 826  (1990),\n                                    \n\nconsidered the scope  of the statute's word \"knowingly.\"  It\n\nheld  that \"knowingly\"  modifies  only  the  statute's  word\n\n\"receives\"  (or \"reproduces\"), not its subclause (A) or (B).\n\nConsequently, it \"does  not require\" that a  defendant \"knew\n\nthat the  pornography he .  . . received involved  a minor.\"\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nId.  at 1070.   Two  years later,  in X-Citement  Video, the\n                                                       \n\nNinth   Circuit  pointed  out   that  the  statute,   as  so\n\ninterpreted,  would   permit  conviction  of  a  person  who\n\n\"knowingly receives\"  a video,  but does  not know  that the\n                                                  \n\nvideo   contains   child   pornography.      Because    that\n\ninterpretation would permit  conviction of a person  with an\n\ninnocent   state  of  mind,  the  court  found  the  statute\n\nunconstitutional.  X-Citement  Video, 982 F.2d at  1292; see\n                                                            \n\nNew  York  v.  Ferber,  458  U.S.  747,  765  (1982)  (child\n                     \n\npornography statutes must involve \"some element of scienter\"\n\nto pass constitutional muster).\n\n          We do  not accept  the Ninth  Circuit's conclusion\n\nthat the statute is unconstitutional, however, because we do\n\nnot agree  with the statutory  premise set forth  in Thomas.\n                                                           \n\nIn  our  view,  and  in  the  view  of  all courts  to  have\n\nconsidered the matter  since the X-Citement  Video decision,\n                                                  \n\nsee United  States v. Edwards, No. 92-CR-884, 1993 WL 453461\n                             \n\n(N.D.  Ill. Nov.  4, 1993);  United States  v.

That  is to say,  we understand  the\n\nstatute  to require for conviction that the government prove\n\nnot only  that the defendant \"knowingly receive[d]\" material\n\nthat  he knows  contains a  \"visual depiction\"  of a  person\n\n\"engaging in sexually  explicit conduct,\" but also  that the\n\ndefendant  knows that  the person  so depicted  is  a minor.\n\nAccord Edwards, 1993 WL 453461 at *5; Long, 831 F.  Supp. at\n                                          \n\n586; Kempton, 826  F. Supp. at 389;  Prytz, 822 F.

However,  that linguistic\n\nfact  simply reflects the  more basic fact  that statements,\n\nand  parts of statements,  quite often derive  their meaning\n\nfrom  context.  The  sentence \"John knows  that people speak\n\nSpanish in Tegucigalpa,  which is the capital  of Honduras,\"\n\ntaken by itself,  leaves us  uncertain whether  or not  John\n\nknows  that Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras; but, the\n\ncontext  of  the story  in  which  the sentence  appears,  a\n\ncontext  that includes  other sentences,  may  clear up  our\n\nuncertainty and leave us with no doubt at all.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          Similarly,   when   courts    interpret   criminal\n\nstatutes,  they draw  upon context, including  the statute's\n\npurpose  and   various  background   legal  principles,   to\n\ndetermine which  states of  mind accompany  which particular\n\nelements of  the offense.   Thus, courts normally  hold that\n\nthe prosecutor need  not prove the defendant's state of mind\n\nin respect to  \"jurisdictional facts\" (for example,  that an\n\nassault victim  was a federal officer, or that stolen checks\n                             \n\nmoved in the mail),  whatever the mental state  required for\n                 \n\nthe crime's other  elements.  E.g., United States  v. Feola,\n                                                           \n\n420 U.S.  671, 676-86 (1975);  Barnes v.

Blassingame, 427 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n329, 330 (2d Cir. 1970),  cert. denied, 402 U.S. 945 (1971);\n                                      \n\nsee generally S.  Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong.,  1st Sess. 72-74\n             \n\n(1981).   Context (what  ordinarily counts as  bad behavior;\n\nthe  reason  why  Congress  mentions  jurisdictional  facts;\n\netc.), in addition  to the position of words  in a sentence,\n\nhelps a court decide how, and when, to interpret statutes as\n\nincorporating states of  mind.  See, e.g.,  Blassingame, 427\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 330.\n\n          The  background  context  here  includes the  fact\n\nthat, when a criminal statute  is totally silent about state\n\nof mind (as is commonly the case), courts nonetheless assume\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nthat  Congress intended  to  require  some  kind  of  guilty\n\nknowledge with respect  to major wrong-creating  elements of\n\nmajor crimes.  Liparota v.  United States, 471 U.S. 419, 426\n                                         \n\n(1985)  (courts   should  not  read  criminal   statutes  as\n\n\"requiring no  mens rea\");  United States  v. United  States\n                                                            \n\nGypsum Co., 438  U.S. 422, 438 (1978) (in criminal statutes,\n          \n\n\"far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase\n\nfrom  the  statutory  definition  is  necessary  to  justify\n\ndispensing  with  an  intent  requirement\");  Morissette  v.\n                                                        \n\nUnited States, 342 U.S. 246, 255-56, 263 (1952).\n             \n\n          Thus, had the word \"knowingly\" not appeared at all\n\nin  the   child  pornography  statute,  courts   (while  not\n\ninsisting  upon  \"knowledge\"  of the  \"interstate  commerce\"\n\nelement of  the  offense,  see  supra pp.  5-6)  would  have\n                                     \n\ninsisted nonetheless  that prosecutors prove  a guilty state\n\nof mind  in respect to the nature of  the material.  For one\n\nthing, the fact that the  material shows a child engaging in\n\nsexually   explicit  activity   is  not   a  secondary,   or\n\njurisdictional, aspect  of the crime.   It is the  moral and\n\ncriminal heart  of the matter.   For another  thing, without\n\nsuch a requirement, the statute would severely punish purely\n\ninnocent  conduct.

Such an\n\ninterpretation therefore violates courts'  duty to interpret\n\nfederal  statutes so  that  they  are  consistent  with  the\n\nfederal  Constitution whenever  possible.   E.g.,  Edward J.\n                                                            \n\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr.

It seems\n\nfar  more likely that Congress used  the word \"knowingly\" to\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nmake clear  that it  did intend to  insist that  a defendant\n                        \n\nknow the  child-pornographic nature  of the  material.   The\n\nlegislative  history  confirms  this  view.    For  example,\n\nSenator Roth, the author of the amendment which extended the\n\noriginal bill  to distribution  as well  as production,  was\n\nasked whether the amendment meant that \n\n          the  distributor  or  seller  must  have\n          [either]  actual   knowledge  that   the\n          materials do contain  child pornographic\n          depictions, or [that] he should have had\n          such actual knowledge.\n\nHe responded:\n\n          That  is   absolutely  correct.     This\n          amendment,  limited  as  it  is  by  the\n          phrase  \"knowingly,\"  insures  that only\n                                                  \n          those sellers  and distributors  who are\n          consciously and deliberately  engaged in\n                                                  \n          the marketing  of child  pornography and\n                                              \n          thereby are actively contributing to the\n          maintenance of this  form of child abuse\n          are  subject to  prosecution under  this\n          amendment.\n\n123 Cong.

Thus, the Department and the amendment's author\n\nagreed that the  point of the statute's explicit  use of the\n\nword \"knowingly\" lies in the application of that word to the\n\nnature of the material's contents,  not to the nature of its\n                                 \n\ndistribution or receipt. \n\n          It  is true  that the Department  also said,  in a\n\ndifferent context,\n\n          We assume that it was not  the intention\n                                                  \n          of   the   drafters   to   require   the\n          Government to  prove that  the defendant\n                                                  \n          knew the child was under age sixteen but\n                                              \n          merely to prove  that the child  was, in\n          fact, less than age sixteen.  \n\nId., 1978  U.S.C.C.A.N. at 64  (emphasis added).   In saying\n   \n\nthis, however, the  Department was referring to  a different\n                                                            \n\nstatutory  provision --  one that penalized  production, not\n                                                       \n\ndistribution.  And  Congress responded by dropping  the word\n\n\"knowingly\"  from the production section of the statute, but\n\nnot from the distribution section.  H.R. Conf. Rep.

It said,\n\n          To    clarify    the    situation,   the\n          legislative history  might reflect  that\n          the defendant's knowledge  of the age of\n                                                  \n          the  child  is  not  an  element of  the\n                                          \n          offense,  but  that  the  bill  is   not\n                                                  \n          intended    to    apply    to   innocent\n                                 \n          transportation with no  knowledge of the\n                                                  \n          nature  or  character  of  the  material\n                               \n          involved.\n\nReport,  supra, at  29, 1978  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 64  (emphasis\n              \n\nadded).    We have  found  nothing  in  the statute  or  the\n\nlegislative  history,  however,  to  suggest  that  Congress\n\nadopted  this   recommendation.     To  the  contrary,   the\n\nlegislative history reveals  congressional awareness of  the\n\nimportant constitutional differences between adult and child\n\npornography, the likely constitutional significance of  age,\n\nand the concomitant  constitutional need for a  guilty state\n\nof mind  requirement with  respect to age.   See,  e.g., 123\n                                                       \n\nCong.  Rec. 33,048 (1977) (statement of Sen. Goldwater); id.\n                                                            \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nat  33,051 (statement  of Sen.  Hatch).   In  light of  this\n\nbackground,  we conclude that the statute's word \"knowingly\"\n\napplies to age  as well as  to conduct.   That being so,  we\n\nfind  no  constitutional  obstacle  to  application  of  the\n\nstatute  in the  case before us.   (We note  that while this\n\nopinion  was circulating in draft  form among the members of\n\nthis  panel, another panel  of this  court reached  the same\n\nconclusion.  See United States v. Gifford, No. 93-1645, slip\n                                         \n\nop. at 20-23 (1st Cir.

Consequently,\n\nGendron's strongest  evidence-based claim does  not deny his\n\nhaving   engaged  in  conduct  that  violates  the  statute.\n\nRather, he  argues that  the evidence  shows the  government\n\n\"entrapped\"  him  into doing  so.   Gendron  notes  that the\n\nentrapment  defense has  two parts:    (1) the  government's\n\n\"inducement\"  of criminal behavior;  (2) by a  defendant who\n\nwas  not  \"predisposed\" to  commit  the crime.    See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nUnited States v.  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809,  812-15 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1988) (setting  forth elements  of  entrapment and  relevant\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nevidentiary  burdens).   Although  the court  submitted  the\n\nentrapment issue to  the jury, which found  against Gendron,\n\nhe  argues  that the  evidence  did not  support  the jury's\n\nverdict.   He says that  it did not allow  the government to\n\nrebut his  claim of \"inducement,\"  nor was it  sufficient to\n\nshow  (beyond  a reasonable  doubt) his  \"predisposition\" to\n\ncommit  the crime.   Consequently, he says,  particularly in\n\nlight of  a recent Supreme  Court case that  accepted rather\n\nsimilar arguments,  Jacobson v.  United States,  112 S.  Ct.\n                                              \n\n1535 (1992), the law requires a judgment of acquittal.\n\n          It may help in evaluating Gendron's argument if we\n\nset  forth  in  simplified terms  our  understanding  of the\n\nentrapment   defense   and   its   elements.     (For   more\n\ncomprehensive accounts, see, e.g., Rodriguez, supra; S.

Ct. Rev. 111.)  The Supreme Court\n               \n\nhas described  that defense  as resting  upon an  assumption\n\nthat  Congress,  when enacting  criminal statutes,  does not\n\nintend the statute to apply to violations arising out of (1)\n\nthe  government's \"abuse\" of  its crime \"detection\"  and law\n                        \n\n\"enforcement\"  efforts   by  \"instigati[ng]\"   the  criminal\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nbehavior  and \"lur[ing]\" to commit the crime (2) persons who\n\nare  \"otherwise innocent.\"   Sorrells v.

Consequently, the\n\nentrapment  doctrine  forbids  punishment of  an  \"otherwise\n                                                            \n\ninnocent\"  person whose \"alleged offense\" is \"the product of\n                                                            \n\nthe creative activity\"  of government officials.

As the Supreme Court has recently stated,\n\n          When   the   Government's    quest   for\n          conviction leads to  the apprehension of\n          an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if\n                                                  \n          left to  his own  devices, likely  would\n                                   \n          have  never run  afoul of  the  law, the\n          courts should intervene.\n\nJacobson, 112  S. Ct. at  1543 (emphasis added).   Since the\n        \n\nCourt has repeatedly expressed concern about both government\n                                                 \n\n\"abuse\"  of  its enforcement  powers (or  the like)  and the\n                                                        \n\n\"otherwise law-abiding  citizen\" (or  the like),  it is  not\n\nsurprising that the defense has  two parts, one that focuses\n\nupon  government  \"inducement\"   and  the  other  upon   the\n\ndefendant's \"predisposition.\"\n\n          In    describing    \"inducement,\"    courts   have\n\ndistinguished between  proper and  improper law  enforcement\n\nactivities.   It is  proper (i.e., not  an \"inducement\") for\n\nthe government to  use a \"sting,\" at least  where it amounts\n\nto providing a defendant  with an \"opportunity\" to  commit a\n\ncrime.  E.g.,  Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 441;  Sherman v.

Without this kind of law\n\nenforcement  weapon,  it  would often  prove  difficult,  or\n\nimpossible,  to stop  certain  seriously criminal  activity,\n\nparticularly  activity  involving drugs,  or  corruption, or\n\nother crimes in which no direct participant  wants the crime\n\ndetected.  See  Hampton v. United States, 425  U.S. 484, 495\n                                        \n\nn.7  (1976)  (Powell, J.,  concurring  in judgment);  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                 \n\n          An  improper  \"inducement,\" however,  goes  beyond\n\nproviding  an  ordinary  \"opportunity to  commit  a  crime.\"\n\nJacobson, 112 S.  Ct. at 1541.  An  \"inducement\" consists of\n        \n\nan \"opportunity\" plus something else -- typically, excessive\n                     \n\npressure  by  the  government  upon  the  defendant  or  the\n\ngovernment's  taking  advantage   of  an  alternative,  non-\n\ncriminal  type of  motive.    A  \"sting\"  that  combines  an\n\nordinary opportunity with these extra elements runs the risk\n\nof catching  in the law  enforcement net not only  those who\n\nmight  well have  committed  the  crime  elsewhere  (in  the\n\nabsence of the  sting), but also those who  (in its absence)\n\nlikely would never have done so.  Insofar as the net catches\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nthe  latter, it stretches  beyond its basic  law enforcement\n\npurpose. \n\n          Some examples of  improper \"inducement\" may  help.\n\nCourts have found  a basis for sending  the entrapment issue\n\nto  the jury (or finding entrapment  established as a matter\n\nof law) where government officials:  (1) used \"intimidation\"\n\nand \"threats\" against a defendant's family, United States v.\n                                                         \n\nBecerra, 992 F.2d 960, 963 (9th Cir. 1993); (2) called every\n       \n\nday,   \"began   threatening\"   the   defendant,   and   were\n\nbelligerent,  United States v. Groll, 992 F.2d 755, 759 (7th\n                                    \n\nCir.  1993);  (3)  engaged in  \"forceful\"  solicitation  and\n\n\"dogged   insistence    until   [defendant]    capitulated,\"\n\nRodriguez,  858 F.2d  at 815;  (4)  played upon  defendant's\n         \n\nsympathy  for informant's  common  narcotics experience  and\n\nwithdrawal  symptoms, Sherman, 356  U.S. at 373;  (5) played\n                             \n\nupon sentiment of \"one former  war buddy . . .  for another\"\n\nto  get liquor (during  prohibition), Sorrells, 287  U.S. at\n                                              \n\n440-41; (6) used \"repeated suggestions\" which succeeded only\n\nwhen defendant  had lost  his job and  needed money  for his\n\nfamily's food  and rent, United  States v. Kessee,  992 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1001, 1003 (9th Cir. 1993); (7) told defendant that she (the\n\nagent) was suicidal  and in desperate need  of money, United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Sullivan, 919 F.2d  1403, 1419 &amp; n.21  (10th Cir.\n                   \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n1990).    The   background  and  context  of   each  example\n\nillustrate possible  government  \"overreaching\"  --  of  its\n\nhaving acted unfairly by employing\n\n          methods of persuasion or inducement that\n          create a substantial  risk that such  an\n          offense  will  be committed  by  persons\n          other than those who are ready to commit\n          it.\n\nModel Penal Code   2.13(1)(b).\n\n          The  second   part  of  the   entrapment  defense,\n\n\"predisposition,\" is somewhat more  difficult to understand.\n\nSome  Supreme Court  Justices (and  the  Model Penal  Code's\n\nauthors)  have  argued  that \"predisposition\"  is  not  even\n\nrelevant.   Rather,  they thought  that  the defense  should\n\nfocus  only  upon  government  impropriety,  preventing  law\n\nenforcement officers  from  using methods  that  might  lead\n\nordinary  law-abiding citizens  astray,  whether or  not the\n\nparticular  defendant was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Model Penal Code    2.13; Sorrells, 287  U.S. at\n                                              \n\n453  (Roberts,  J.,   joined  by  Brandeis  &amp;   Stone,  JJ.,\n\nconcurring)  (arguing  for  this  \"objective\"  view  of  the\n\ndefense);  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 378 (Frankfurter, J., joined\n                  \n\nby Douglas, Harlan &amp; Brennan, JJ., concurring) (same).   The\n\nSupreme Court itself,  however, has rejected this  view.  It\n\nsaw in the entrapment defense not so much a sanction used to\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\ncontrol  police  conduct,  but rather  a  protection  of the\n\nordinary    law-abiding    citizen     against    government\n\noverreaching.   Consequently, it  saw  no need  to permit  a\n\ndefendant  to take  advantage  of  that  defense  unless  he\n\nhimself was such  a citizen.  See, e.g.,  Sorrells, 287 U.S.\n                                                  \n\nat 448;  Sherman,  356  U.S. at  376-77;  United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\nRussell, 411 U.S. 423, 433-35 (1973).  The upshot is that we\n       \n\nmust find out  just who that \"innocent  person\" is.   Who is\n\nthe   \"otherwise   law-abiding   citizen\"   who  would   not\n                \n\n\"otherwise\" have committed the crime?  \n\n          The  question's   difficulty  lies  in   the  word\n\n\"otherwise.\"  That word requires us to abstract from present\n\ncircumstances.   We cannot  simply ask whether,  without the\n\ngovernment's present  activity, the  defendant would  likely\n\nhave committed  the crime when  he did.  After  all, without\n                              \n\nthe  government's  having  presented that  opportunity,  the\n                                         \n\ndefendant,  no matter  how \"predisposed,\"  would  likely not\n\nhave  acted  then.    Nor  can we  simply  ask  whether  the\n                 \n\ndefendant  would have acted similarly at some other time had\n                                                            \n\nhe faced similar  circumstances, since his present  behavior\n                               \n\nvirtually compels  an  affirmative answer  to  the  question\n\nphrased in this way.\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\n          The right way to ask the question, it seems to us,\n\nis  to  abstract from  --  to  assume  away --  the  present\n\ncircumstances    insofar   as    they   reveal    government\n                                                            \n\noverreaching.    That is  to  say,  we  should ask  how  the\n            \n\ndefendant  likely   would  have   reacted  to   an  ordinary\n                                                            \n\nopportunity to commit  the crime.  See Jacobson,  112 S. Ct.\n                                               \n\nat 1540  n.2.   By  using the  word \"ordinary,\"  we mean  an\n\nopportunity  that  lacked  those  special  features  of  the\n\ngovernment's conduct that made of it  an \"inducement,\" or an\n\n\"overreaching.\"   Was the defendant \"predisposed\" to respond\n\naffirmatively to a proper, not to an improper, lure?  \n                                             \n\n          This way of  looking at the  matter seems to  flow\n\nfrom the  way in  which the Supreme  Court has  resolved the\n\nclash  between   \"objective\"  and   \"subjective\"  views   of\n\nentrapment --  at least if  one looks at that  resolution as\n\nsimply denying the defense to one whom it is not designed to\n\nhelp, namely the kind  of defendant who (without a  \"sting\")\n\nmight  well be  out committing  crimes  of the  sort that  a\n\n\"sting\"  seeks to  stop.    See Russell,  411  U.S. at  434.\n                                       \n\nFurther,  our  effort  to  define  \"predisposition\"  through\n\nreference to the  nature of the government  conduct reflects\n\nthe  fact  that,  despite  partial  descriptions  that focus\n\nprimarily upon  the defendant's  state  of mind,  government\n                                                            \n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nmisconduct  lies at  the heart  of  the entrapment  defense.\n\nWere that  not so --  were the issue simply  the defendant's\n\nstate of  mind --  the law would  permit an  innocent minded\n\ndefendant to raise an entrapment claim when a private person\n                                                     \n\n\"induced\" him  (through similar  \"overreaching\" conduct)  to\n\ncommit a crime.  But the  law does not authorize the defense\n\nin  those circumstances,  however  \"outrageous\" the  private\n\nperson's conduct.   E.g., Russell,  411 U.S. at  433; United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v.  Jones, 950  F.2d  1309 (7th  Cir.  1991); United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Bradley, 820  F.2d 3, 6  (1st Cir.  1987); United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Emmert,  829  F.2d 805  (9th  Cir. 1987);  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  McLernon, 746 F.2d 1098 (6th  Cir. 1984); Whiting\n                                                            \n\nv. United States, 321 F.2d 72, 76 (1st Cir. 1963). \n                \n\n          Finally,  this   way  of  phrasing   the  question\n\nprevents one from concluding automatically, simply from  the\n\nfact  that the defendant  committed the  crime, that  he was\n\n\"predisposed\" to commit it.  At the same time, if the answer\n\nto the  question so  phrased is  affirmative, the  defendant\n\nwould seem to be the sort of person (and his conduct in this\n\ninstance is the  sort of conduct) that  the criminal statute\n\nintends to punish.  He is, in other words, someone who would\n\nlikely commit the crime under  the circumstances and for the\n\nreasons   normally  associated  with  that  crime,  and  who\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\ntherefore poses  the  sort of  threat  to society  that  the\n\nstatute  seeks to control, and which the government, through\n\nthe \"sting,\" seeks to stop.\n\n          We  turn now  to Jacobson  v.  United States,  the\n                                                      \n\nrecent  child pornography case where the Supreme Court found\n\nentrapment as  a  matter  of law,  and  upon  which  Gendron\n\nheavily  relies.  Government agents found Jacobson's name on\n\na bookstore mailing list  that indicated that the store  had\n\nmailed photos  of naked  children to  Jacobson.   Government\n\nagents then sent Jacobson letters from fictitious people and\n\norganizations, soliciting orders for  child pornography.  In\n\nthree  respects,  however,  they did  more  than  provide an\n\nordinary opportunity to  buy child pornography:   First, the\n\nsolicitations reflected a psychologically \"graduated\" set of\n\nresponses to Jacobson's own noncriminal responses, beginning\n\nwith  innocent lures and  progressing to frank  offers.  The\n\ngovernment started  with a \"sexual  attitude questionnaire,\"\n\nwhich  elicited a  general interest  in  \"pre-teen sex\";  it\n\nfollowed  with   letters  containing   general,  nonexplicit\n\nreferences implying a  possibility of child pornography;  it\n\nthen  sent  Jacobson  more   personal  correspondence;  and,\n\nfinally   (but   after   Jacobson   had   discontinued   the\n\ncorrespondence), it  sent him child  pornography catalogues.\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\n112  S. Ct. at 1538-39.  Second, the government's soliciting\n\nletters  sometimes depicted  their senders as  \"free speech\"\n\nlobbying organizations and  fighters for the \"right  to read\n\nwhat  we  desire\";  they asked  Jacobson  to  \"fight against\n\ncensorship  and the infringement of individual rights.\"  Id.\n                                                            \n\nat 1538, 1542.  Third, the government's effort to provide an\n\n\"opportunity\"  to buy child  pornography stretched  out over\n\ntwo and  a half  years.  Taken  together, one might  find in\n\nthese three sets of circumstances -- the graduated response,\n\nthe long time  period, the appeal to a  proper (free speech)\n\nmotive --  a substantial risk  of inducing an  ordinary law-\n\nabiding person to commit the crime.  Indeed, the  government\n\nconceded  in  Jacobson   that  its  methods  amounted,   for\n                      \n\nentrapment  purposes, to an  improper \"inducement.\"   Id. at\n                                                         \n\n1540 n.2.\n\n          Jacobson's  importance,   however,  concerns   the\n                  \n\n\"predisposition\"  part of the entrapment defense.  The Court\n\nheld  that  the  evidence,  as  a matter  of  law,  required\n\nacquittal  because a reasonable jury would have had to doubt\n\nJacobson's predisposition.   The evidence  of predisposition\n\nconsisted of  two facts:    (1) that  before the  government\n\nbecame  involved  Jacobson  was  on  a  private  bookstore's\n\nmailing  list for dubious photos; and  (2) that he responded\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\naffirmatively to the government's solicitations.  The  first\n\nfact,  the Court wrote, showed little about a predisposition\n\nto act unlawfully because ordering the photos was lawful  at\n         \n\nthe time.  112 S. Ct. at 1542.  The second,  placing orders,\n\ncould  not  show  how  Jacobson  would  have  acted had  the\n\nsolicitation lacked the  three elements  we just  mentioned,\n\nnamely, the improper appeals to anti-censorship motives, the\n\ngraduated response,  and the  lengthy time  frame.   Id.  at\n                                                        \n\n1542-43.     The  government   therefore   failed  to   show\n\n\"predisposition\" (beyond  a reasonable  doubt).  That  means\n\n(as we understand it) that the government's evidence did not\n\nshow how Jacobson would have acted had he been faced with an\n\nordinary \"opportunity\"  to commit  the crime  rather than  a\n\nspecial \"inducement.\"\n\n          Gendron's  case is  similar  to Jacobson's  in two\n\nrespects.   The government initially found Gendron's name on\n\na \"naked children\" mailing list, and the government sent him\n\nchild pornography solicitations over a fairly long period of\n\ntime (one  of  the \"sham\"  companies  was also  involved  in\n\nJacobson).  There are, however, two critical differences.\n        \n\n          First,  any governmental  \"overreaching\" here  was\n\nless extensive  than in  Jacobson.   The government  neither\n                                 \n\n\"graduated\" its  responses  (from  innocent  lure  to  frank\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\noffer) nor, with one exception,  did it appeal to any motive\n\nother  than  the  desire  to see  child  pornography.    The\n\nexception  consists  of  one solicitation  (also  present in\n\nJacobson) in which the government's sham company referred to\n        \n\n\"hysterical nonsense\"  about pornography, and asked  why the\n\ngovernment  was  \"spending millions  of dollars  to exercise\n\ninternational censorship  while  tons of  drugs\"  enter  the\n\ncountry  \"easily.\"  Nonetheless, here the government did not\n\ndisguise  itself as a \"sexual rights\" lobbying organization,\n\nseeking to lobby  Congress to remove restraints  and funding\n\nits efforts through  pornographic catalogue sales.   Nor did\n\nthe government ask  Gendron to commit the crime  as a matter\n\nof principle.   See 112 S. Ct. at  1538-39, 1542.  Since the\n                   \n\n\"overreaching\" here was far less extensive than in Jacobson,\n                                                           \n\nthere   is   less   reason   to   believe   that  government\n\n\"overreaching\" (i.e.,  an improper \"inducement\")  could lead\n\nan  \"otherwise innocent\"  person to  commit the crime.   See\n                                                            \n\nGifford, No. 93-1645, slip op. at 15-16.\n       \n\n          Second, the  record contains  substantial evidence\n\nof  Gendron's state  of  mind;  that  evidence  permits  the\n\nconclusion  that (inducement or not) he was \"predisposed\" to\n\ncommit the crime.  In late 1986, when Gendron first received\n\na verbally explicit  \"child pornography\" catalogue  from the\n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\ngovernment's sham company, he placed an order accompanied by\n\na letter in which he said,\n\n          I  have  finally   found  the  kind   of\n          educational material I've  been dreaming\n          of  possessing for quite some time.  I .\n          .  . [am so] excited that I have decided\n          to order two of your titles . . . .\n\nThe government did not fill the order, but three years later\n\nGendron responded to a letter  from another sham, a  pretend\n\nforeign  company, which spoke  of \"hard to  obtain erotica.\"\n\nHe wrote,\n\n          I am very interested  in the other  part\n          of your services that are very difficult\n          to  obtain in  my country.  . .  . I  am\n          becoming   very    bored   with    adult\n          pornography .  . . .  I  like very young\n          girls  only and  color videos.   Can you\n          help me.\n\nThe sham firm  responded with an explicit  child pornography\n\ncatalogue,  and  Gendron  ordered  several  of  the  titles.\n\n(Again the government did not fill the order.)  A few months\n\nlater the  government sent  Gendron a  third explicit  child\n\npornography catalogue.   Gendron sent  back an  order and  a\n\ncheck.  Two months later, he wrote again, asking if the firm\n\nhad \"forgotten\" his order, making clear that he still wanted\n\n\"this type of educational materials,\" stating, \"don't worry,\n\nI am  not connected  in any way  with law  enforcement,\" and\n\nadding \"Please Hurry.\"  (This time the government filled the\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\norder with the video that  led to this prosecution.)  Unlike\n\nJacobson's correspondence, Gendron's  correspondence reveals\n\nonly a desire to view child pornography; it contains nothing\n\nlike Jacobson's urging  of a \"counter attack\"  against those\n\n\"who are determined to curtail our freedoms.\"  112 S. Ct. at\n\n1538.  (See Appendix for a detailed chronology of the events\n\nin Gendron's case.)\n\n          This evidence, taken together, reveals a defendant\n\nwho met an initial opportunity to buy child pornography with\n\nenthusiasm,    who  responded  to  each  further  government\n\ninitiative  with a purchase order, and who, unlike Jacobson,\n\nshowed  no   particular  interest   in  an   anti-censorship\n\ncampaign.  This evidence, as we have said, permits a jury to\n\nfind (beyond  a reasonable  doubt) that  Gendron would  have\n\nresponded   affirmatively   to   the    most   ordinary   of\n\nopportunities, and, hence,  was \"predisposed\" to  commit the\n\ncrime.   We therefore  find the  jury's entrapment  decision\n\nlawful.\n\n                            III\n\n                     Search and Seizure\n                                       \n\n          Government  agents searched  Gendron's house,  and\n\nseized  the  primary  piece  of  evidence  (the  videotape),\n\n                            -27-\n                             27\n\npursuant to a warrant.  That warrant authorized (1) a search\n\nof\n\n          the residence of Daniel  A. Gendron, 105\n          Winthrop Street, Rehoboth, Massachusetts\n          02769;\n\nfor (2)  a \"VHS videocassette  labeled PTL (1)\"  and related\n\nitems; (3) \"after delivery by  mail to and receipt by Daniel\n                                                            \n\nGendron\" of a specifically described parcel  (containing the\n       \n\ntape) until  the expiration of  the warrant (ten  days after\n\nits issuance).  Gendron concedes that  the warrant meets the\n\nConstitution's  two basic  requirements:   its  issuance was\n\nsupported  by \"probable cause\"  to believe that  evidence of\n\ncriminal  activity  would  exist  in  his  house  after  the\n\ndelivery of the  tape; and it \"particularly  describ[es] the\n\nplace to be  searched, and the .  . . things to  be seized.\"\n\nU.S. Const.  amend. IV.   He claims  that it  is nonetheless\n\ninvalid  because it is an \"anticipatory warrant\" which fails\n\nadequately to specify the time at which it will take effect.\n                              \n\nGendron  cites  in  support  a  recent  case  decided  by  a\n\ndifferent   panel   of   this  court,   United   States   v.\n                                                       \n\nRicciardelli, 998 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1993).\n            \n\n          In  general, the  simple fact  that  a warrant  is\n\n\"anticipatory\"  --  i.e.,  that it  takes  effect,  not upon\n\nissuance,  but  at  a  specified  future  time  -- does  not\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\ninvalidate a warrant  or make it somehow suspect  or legally\n\ndisfavored.  Warrants  often do specify that  they will take\n\neffect upon issuance.  But the Constitution imposes no  such\n\nrequirement.   Rather,  it says  that a  search must  not be\n\n\"unreasonable,\"  and  that  warrants must  be  supported  by\n\n\"probable cause.\"  U.S. Const.  amend. IV.  There is nothing\n\nunreasonable  about authorizing a  search for  tomorrow, not\n\ntoday, when  reliable information indicates  that, say,  the\n\nmarijuana will reach the house, not now, but then.  Nor does\n\nit  seem  automatically  unreasonable to  tie  the warrant's\n\nsearch authority to the future event that brings with it the\n\nprobable cause (e.g., the time of \"delivery of a large brown\n\npackage   addressed   to   X   with  return   address   Y\").\n\nRicciardelli, 998 F.2d at 10-11.  In principle, the use of a\n            \n\n\"triggering event\"  can help  assure that  the search  takes\n\nplace   only  when   justified  by  \"probable   cause\";  and\n            \n\nanticipatory warrants may thereby offer greater, not lesser,\n\nprotection  against  unreasonable  invasion  of a  citizen's\n\nprivacy.  As one commentator has put it,\n\n          as a  general proposition the  facts put\n          forward  to   justify  issuance   of  an\n          anticipatory warrant are  more likely to\n          establish that probable cause will exist\n          at  the  time  of  the  search  than the\n          typical  warrant based  solely upon  the\n          known  prior location of the items to be\n          searched at the place to be searched.\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\n2  Wayne R. LaFave,  Search and Seizure    3.7(c), at 97 (2d\n\ned. \n\n1987).      Were  \"anticipatory   warrants\"   unlawful,  law\n\nenforcement agents would  have to wait until  the triggering\n\nevent  occurred; then,  if  time did  not  permit a  warrant\n\napplication,  they would have to forego a legitimate search,\n\nor, more  likely, simply  conduct the  search (justified  by\n\n\"exigent  circumstances\") without any  warrant at all.   See\n                                                            \n\nVale  v.  Louisiana, 399  U.S. 30,  34-35 (1970);  2 LaFave,\n                   \n\nsupra,   6.5.   We are not surprised  that courts have found\n     \n\n\"anticipatory warrants,\"  considered as  a class,  perfectly\n\nconsistent with  the Constitution.  E.g.,  Ricciardelli, 998\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at  10-11; United States  v. Garcia, 882 F.2d  699, 703\n                                        \n\n(2d Cir.  1989); United States  v. Goodwin, 854 F.2d  33, 36\n                                          \n\n(4th Cir. 1988); United States v. Hale, 784 F.2d 1465, 1468-\n                                      \n\n69  (9th Cir.  1986); People  v. Glen,  282 N.E.2d  614, 617\n                                     \n\n(N.Y. 1972).\n\n          Gendron  argues,   however,  that   the  warrant's\n\nreference  to \"delivery  by mail  to  and receipt  by Daniel\n\nGendron\"  does  not  describe  with sufficient  clarity  its\n\n\"triggering event,\" i.e.,  the particular time when  it will\n\ntake  effect.   We agree  with Gendron  that a  warrant must\n\nclearly  say when it  takes effect.   We  also agree  that a\n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\nwarrant that says  it takes effect upon the  occurrence of a\n\nfuture event runs a greater risk of ambiguity than a warrant\n\nthat refers only  to a specific day, month, and  year (as do\n\nordinary search warrants).  That is why courts have required\n\nthat the conditions upon  which anticipatory warrants become\n\neffective  be   \"explicit,  clear,   and  narrowly   drawn.\"\n\nRicciardelli,  998 F.2d at  12 (quoting Garcia,  882 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n703-04).  That  said, however, we do not find any fatal flaw\n\nin the warrant's description.\n\n          First,  the  law's  requirement  with  respect  to\n\nspecificity of time  must be one of  reasonable specificity.\n                                               \n\nGlen, 282 N.E.2d at 619 (warrant should require search to be\n    \n\n\"reasonably contemporaneous\" with  arrival of contraband); 2\n\nLaFave, supra,    3.7(c), at 99 &amp; n.103 (citing  Glen).  One\n                                                     \n\ncan understand how  a specificity requirement in  respect to\n\ntime, like  those in  respect to \"place  to be  searched\" or\n\n\"things to  be seized,\" U.S.  Const. amend. IV,  might limit\n\nthe  discretion of law  enforcement officers to  decide when\n\nand  where and what  to search, thereby  avoiding the \"hated\n\ngeneral  writs of  assistance  of pre-Revolutionary  times,\"\n\nGlen,  282  N.E.2d at  617,  and assuring  the  existence of\n    \n\n\"probable  cause.\"  2 LaFave, supra,    3.7(c), at 99; id.  \n                                                          \n\n4.5,  at 207;  id.    4.6(a), at  236.

To the contrary, Ricciardelli says\n                                                       \n\nthat a warrant's restrictions  in respect to time  and place\n\nshould be \"similar.\"  Id. at 12.\n                         \n\n          Second,  the law  tells  us that  we  are to  read\n\ndescriptions   in   warrants   (and   in  their   supporting\n\ndocuments), not \"hypertechnical[ly],\" but in a \"commonsense\"\n\nfashion.   United  States  v. Ventresca,  380 U.S.  102, 109\n                                       \n\n(1965); see also,  e.g., United States  v.

Antone,\n                                                           \n\n753  F.2d  1301,  1307 (5th  Cir.  1985);  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nCharest, 602  F.2d 1015,  1017 (1st Cir.  1979).  Read  in a\n       \n\ncommonsense fashion, the  warrant's words seem specific  and\n\nclear.  Gendron takes the word \"receipt,\" however, from  the\n\nphrase \"delivery by mail to  and receipt by Daniel Gendron,\"\n\nand argues  that it is  fatally ambiguous  because it  might\n\n                            -32-\n                             32\n\nmean  \"receipt\" anywhere,  say,  downtown  or  at  the  Post\n\nOffice.   But, as we  have pointed out,  see supra pp.  5-6,\n                                                  \n\ncontext helps  to provide  a  word's meaning.   The  context\n\nincludes, at least, the rest of the warrant, which describes\n\nGendron's  house, makes clear that the  object of the search\n\nis  a video  that will  arrive at  that house  by mail,  and\n\nmentions  \"delivery by mail\"  to that  house.   Common sense\n\nsuggests that  the words  \"receipt by  Daniel Gendron\"  also\n\nrefer to receipt at that  house, and not to receipt downtown\n\nor  at  the Post  Office,  or  (to  use our  own  farfetched\n\nexample) in Okinawa.\n\n          We recognize that it is logically possible to read\n\nthe word  \"receipt\" as if  it referred to  receipt somewhere\n\nother than at  Gendron's house.  But that  logical fact does\n\nnot make the word any less specific.  The  logical fact that\n\nthe world undoubtedly contains people named \"Daniel Gendron\"\n\nother  than the  defendant  here  does  not  mean  that  the\n\nwarrant's triggering event, \"delivery by mail to and receipt\n\nby Daniel Gendron,\" is ambiguous because it does not specify\n\nthat  the \"Daniel  Gendron\" to  whom  it refers  is the  one\n\nresiding at the address to be searched.  Despite the logical\n\npossibility that the post office might accidentally  deliver\n\nthe  tape  to  some other  Daniel  Gendron,  thus apparently\n\n                            -33-\n                             33\n\nfulfilling  the literal terms of the warrant, the warrant is\n\nadequately specific  as to the  person to receive  the tape.\n\nSpecificity does  not lie  in  writing words  that deny  all\n\nunintended  logical possibilities.   Rather,  it  lies in  a\n\ncombination of  language and context, which  together permit\n\nthe communication of clear, simple direction.  Any effort to\n\nnegate  all  unintended  logical possibilities  through  the\n\nwritten word alone would produce linguistic complication and\n\nconfusion to the point  where a warrant, in  practice, would\n\nfail to  give the  clear direction that  is its  very point.\n\nThat  is why  we  must avoid  reading  a warrant's  language\n\n\"hypertechnically.\"  See Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 109.\n                                  \n\n          Were it  not for  Ricciardelli, we  would end  the\n                                        \n\ndiscussion  here.      We  must   concede,   however,   that\n\nRicciardelli  found  unlawfully  ambiguous  a  warrant  with\n            \n\nvirtually   identical   language,  namely,   language   that\n\ntriggered the warrant upon\n\n          delivery  by  mail  to  and  receipt  by\n          Steven Ricciardelli of the . . . package\n          containing the videotape.\n\n998 F.2d at  9.  We find a  significant difference, however,\n\nin the factual context in which the warrant was issued.  The\n\nRicciardelli panel referred to what it considered a critical\n            \n\nfact:\n\n                            -34-\n                             34\n\n          the (apparently significant) chance that\n          the package  would not  be delivered  to\n          Ricciardelli's   home   at  all   --   a\n          possibility that [the postal inspectors]\n          undeniably had envisioned.\n\nId. at 17.  The opinion also makes clear  that the \"delivery\n   \n\nby mail\"  was by special  delivery with a  \"return receipt,\"\n\nand  that the postal  inspectors had \"contingency  plans\" in\n\nthe  event that Ricciardelli  received the package somewhere\n\nother than his home.  Id. at 9, 17 &amp;  n.9.  (As it happened,\n                         \n\nthe  \"letter carrier  tried  to  deliver  the  package\"  but\n\nRicciardelli  was not home,  so \"the postman  left a notice\"\n\nthat he  could \"collect  the item at  the post  office,\" and\n\nRicciardelli, in fact,  did pick up the package  at the post\n\noffice, not at his home.  Id. at 9-10.)\n                             \n\n          In  light  of  these  background  facts,  one  can\n\nunderstand  why  the  panel  might  have  thought  the  word\n\n\"receipt,\" in context, was ambiguous as to where the receipt\n\nmight  take place.    After all,  even  the highly  specific\n\nlanguage  in  this case  describing the  item to  be seized,\n\nnamely \"VHS videocassette labeled PTL (1),\" could be thought\n                                                 \n\nambiguous  if the  background of  this case  had revealed  a\n\nserious  possibility of two such items (imagine that Gendron\n                           \n\nhad worked for a  firm called \"PTL Realty Co.\" and had taken\n\nhome a series  of demonstration videos).  This  is simply to\n\n                            -35-\n                             35\n\nsay that  background facts can  sometimes turn  hypothetical\n\npossibilities, such as receipt in Okinawa or delivery to the\n\nwrong Daniel  Gendron, into practical possibilities that, in\n\ncontext,  might  mean  that  one  reading  a  warrant  in  a\n\n\"commonsense\"  fashion  would nonetheless  find  significant\n\nambiguity.  \n\n          Here,   however,   no  background   fact   created\n\nsignificant  ambiguity.     On  the   contrary,  the  postal\n\ninspector's affidavit  specified that  the  parcel \"will  be\n\nplaced  for routine delivery\"  to Gendron \"through  the U.S.\n\nPostal Service,  Rehoboth, MA\";  that after  the parcel  \"is\n\ndelivered by mail and taken into the residence,\" there  will\n                                              \n\nbe \"probable  cause to  believe\" that  evidence of  criminal\n\nconduct will be \"located\" in the house; and that\n\n          surveillance will commence from the time\n          the parcel  is placed  for delivery  [at\n          the Rehoboth  Post Office]  and continue\n          until the parcel  has been delivered  to\n          105 Winthrop St., Rehoboth, MA,\n\nwith probable cause to search arising only \"after the parcel\n                                          \n\nhas  entered the premises\"  (emphasis added).   Moreover, at\n                         \n\ntrial, the postal inspector testified that\n\n          if Mr. Gendron was in Florida, we aren't\n          entitled to  search  his  house  or  his\n          parents' house.   Once it  was delivered\n          into the house, then  the search warrant\n                        \n          became effective.\n\n                            -36-\n                             36\n\nHe added that the house was under surveillance because\n\n          it  was  important to  us  that if  that\n          piece  didn't get  delivered, you  don't\n          execute the search warrant.\n\nTr.  at  115-16  (emphasis  added).    Consequently,  unlike\n\nRicciardelli,  nothing   in  the  record  here   suggests  a\n            \n\nbackground in which the warrant's words, adequately specific\n\nin the context of the warrant, could, as a practical matter,\n\nconvey a different meaning.\n\n          For these reasons, we distinguish Ricciardelli and\n                                                        \n\nfind  that it does  not control the  outcome here.   To make\n\ncertain that our reading of the case is correct, however, we\n\nhave circulated a draft of this opinion to the entire court.\n\nThe  concurring  judge  in  Ricciardelli,  998  F.2d  at  17\n                                        \n\n(Torruella,  J., concurring) believes  that his  views there\n\nwould require  a holding  in Gendron's favor  here.   But, a\n\nmajority  of   the  court   agrees  with   our  reading   of\n\nRicciardelli which  distinguishes that  case from this  one.\n            \n\nSee, e.g., United  States v.  Rivera, 994  F.2d 942,  950-51\n                                    \n\n(1st Cir.  1993).   We  therefore  do not  accept  Gendron's\n\nFourth Amendment claim.\n\n                             IV\n\n                      Other Arguments\n                                     \n\n                            -37-\n                             37\n\n          Gendron  makes three  further  arguments, none  of\n\nwhich requires extended discussion.  \n\n          1.   Jury Instruction.   Gendron  argues that  the\n                               \n\ntrial  court should  have specifically  instructed the  jury\n\nthat it  must find he knew  the person depicted  on the tape\n\nwas under  the age  of 18.   Gendron  did not  ask for  this\n\ncharge, nor did he object to the instruction the judge gave,\n\nwhich required the jury to  find that he \"knew the character\n                                                            \n\nand nature of the material.\"   Nonetheless, he says that the\n                           \n\njudge's \"error\"  was \"plain.\"   Fed.

See\n                                                            \n\nEstelle  v.

The  jury was fully\n          \n\naware that  the issue was child pornography.   The remainder\n                               \n\nof the charge referred frequently to children.

Since\n\nGendron asked  for no  more and we  can find  no significant\n\nlikelihood of prejudice, there is  no plain error.

Gendron  points to  two\n                                 \n\nstatements in  the  prosecutor's closing  argument that,  he\n\nsays, are factually erroneous and significantly prejudicial.\n\nIn  one instance,  the prosecutor  described  the item  that\n\nGendron  had ordered from  the private mail  order catalogue\n\n(sometime before 1985) as follows: \n\n          I  think  the  title of  it  was  Nancy.\n          Nancy  is  described  as  13,  and   her\n          friends  from  No.  6,  and   No.  6  is\n          prepubescence.  Two pretty prepubescents\n          are taught how to become geishas.   This\n          10 year  old, Nancy, and her  friends, a\n          10  year old having  sex with a  12 year\n          old a  delicate blond at 12,  having sex\n          with  her playmate,  7,  hide and  seek,\n          combat, rock.   What is his interest  in\n          this, ladies  and gentlemen?   Children.\n          Female children.\n\nIn  fact,   the  record  contains   the  relevant  catalogue\ndescriptions, which read as follows:\n\n          E-2 NANCY: 13,  and her friends from  #6\n                   \n          THROB.

From full\n\n                            -39-\n                             39\n\n          costume  and make-up  to  nudity.   Some\n          censoring.\n\nGendron's  argument centers  on the  absence  of the  phrase\n\n\"having sex\" in the actual descriptions.  \n\n          In the  other instance,  the prosecutor  described\n\nthe  pornographic tape that  the government sent  Gendron as\n\ncontaining\n\n          explicit depictions  of a  9 to  11 year\n          old  girl  being raped,  being  sexually\n          abused,  by teenage  boys  and an  adult\n          male.\n\nIn  fact, the tape  does not contain  depictions of forcible\n\nrape (although, as the government points out, its depictions\n\nof a child engaging in sex amount to \"statutory rape\").\n\n          We  agree  with   Gendron  that  the  prosecutor's\n\nstatements  were wrong  and  that she  should not  have made\n\nthem.   We cannot agree,  however, that they entitle Gendron\n\nto a  new trial.  That is because  Gendron did not object to\n\nthe statements at  the time.  Had he done so, we are certain\n\nthat the district court would have ordered a correction, and\n\na correction would  have cured any harm by  pointing out the\n\nfacts.   In the  absence of an  objection, however,  we will\n\nnormally  not  order   a  new  trial   unless  there  is   a\n\n\"substantial chance  that absent  the error  the jury  would\n\nhave acquitted,\"  or,  for  some  other reason,  we  fear  a\n\n                            -40-\n                             40\n\n\"miscarriage  of justice.\"  United States v. Young, 470 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n1,  15 (1985); Arrieta-Agressot, 3  F.3d at 528.   We see no\n                               \n\nsuch  miscarriage,   nor  any   significant  likelihood   of\n\nacquittal, here.  \n\n          The  evidence in  this  case  was strong,  perhaps\n\noverwhelming.   The  jury saw  portions of  the  tape, which\n\nportrays a nine year old girl engaging  in sexually explicit\n\nactivities with teenage and adult men.  Gendron says nothing\n\nto suggest that the tape leaves any doubt about the unlawful\n\nnature of its  contents.  Thus, in this  particular case, we\n\ndo not think the  single use of the word \"rape,\" forceful as\n\nit is, could have had any significant prejudicial impact  on\n\nthe jury beyond the impact of the tape itself.  The question\n\nof the videotape descriptions, because of their relevance to\n\nthe   \"predisposition\"  element   of  Gendron's   entrapment\n\ndefense, is  a little  closer.  But,  as we  have described,\n\nsupra pp.  24-26, the  evidence of  predisposition was  very\n     \n\nstrong.    We  do  not  believe the  misdescription  of  the\n\noriginal  mail order  would likely  have  had any  practical\n\neffect on the  jury's \"no entrapment\" finding,  particularly\n\nbecause  the correct description  was admitted into evidence\n\nand available to the jury.  In light of the strength  of the\n\ngovernment's case (\"an  important factor in  considering the\n\n                            -41-\n                             41\n\nlikely  effect of  borderline  rhetoric,\" United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\nMejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir. 1987)), whether we\n            \n\nconsider the two misstatements  separately or together,  the\n\n\"error\" they reflect is not \"plain.\"\n\n          3.  Other Erotica.  Gendron argues that  the court\n                           \n\nerred in allowing, as evidence  of \"predisposition,\" various\n\n\"child erotic\" (but not illegal)  items seized at his  home.\n\nHe does  not seriously argue,  however, that the  items were\n\nnot relevant.   See  Jacobson, 112 S.  Ct. at  1542 (stating\n                             \n\nthat similar material \"by itself\" was not sufficient to show\n\npredisposition).    Rather,  he   says  its  usefulness  was\n\noutweighed by its  tendency to prejudice the jury.   Fed. R.\n\nEvid.  403.   The balancing  at issue,  however, is  for the\n\ndistrict court, not this court.  United States  v. Williams,\n                                                           \n\n985  F.2d  634,  637  (1st  Cir. 1993).    The  court  might\n\nreasonably  have concluded, in  light of  the nature  of the\n\nbasic evidence  in the case (the videotape itself), that the\n\nnature  of  the  additional child-erotic  material  made  no\n\nsignificant prejudicial  difference.   We find  no abuse  of\n\ndiscretion in this determination.\n\n          Gendron's additional arguments are without merit.\n\n          For  the  above  reasons,  the  judgment  of   the\n\ndistrict court is\n\n                            -42-\n                             42\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -43-\n                             43\n\n          POLLAK, District Judge (concurring).  I concur  in\n                                \n\nthe  judgment of  the  court and  in  the court's  carefully\n\nwrought and  illuminating opinion.   The opinion  addresses,\n\ncomprehensively  and  in  painstaking  detail,  all  of  the\n\nsubstantial questions  presented.  I  would add  only a  few\n\nwords.\n\n          First.    As  the  court's  opinion  makes  clear,\n               \n\nconstitutional  difficulties  of   serious  dimension  would\n\nattend the child-pornography statute if, in prosecutions for\n\nknowing  receipt of a \"visual depiction\" of \"a minor engaged\n\nin sexually explicit  conduct,\" 18 U.S.C.    2252(a)(2), the\n\nphrase \"knowingly receives\" were  not construed as requiring\n\nthe government to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\nthe  \"visual depiction\" was one which  the defendant knew to\n\ninvolve, not just pornography, but child pornography.  These\n                                        \n\npotential  constitutional difficulties  are obviated  by the\n\ncourt's persuasive demonstration of \"congressional awareness\n\nof the  important constitutional  differences between  adult\n\nand child pornography,\"  with the result that, as  the court\n\nconcludes,  the proper  reading of  what  Congress wrote  is\n\n\"that the statute's word 'knowingly' applies to age as  well\n\nas conduct.\"\n\n                            -44-\n                             44\n\n          In  the case  at  bar, appellant  Gendron contends\n\nthat the pertinent  aspect of the charge given  by the trial\n\ncourt -- namely  that the government  was required to  prove\n\nthat Gendron \"knew the character and nature of the material\"\n\n-- was deficient in that  it did not say expressly  that the\n\ngovernment had to have proved  that Gendron knew that one of\n\nthe actors  depicted in the videotape was  a minor.  But, as\n\nthe  court   notes,  Gendron   did  not   request  such   an\n\ninstruction.  Moreover,  as the  court shows,  it is  highly\n\nunlikely  that the jury could have failed to understand that\n\nthe central focus  of the charge was that  Gendron was eager\n\nto  acquire,  and  through the  government's    good offices\n\nultimately   did  acquire,   a  videotape   depicting  child\n                                                            \n\npornography.  That  is to say, in  the case at bar  the fact\n\nthat the trial  court did not  give the more  particularized\n\ncharge that appellant  did not request  cannot realistically\n\nbe supposed to have  affected the jury's deliberations in  a\n\nfashion  detrimental to appellant.   In future  trials under\n\nthis statute, defendants will  presumably request, and trial\n\ncourts  will surely give, a more particularized statement of\n\nwhat \"knowingly\" comprehends.\n\n          Second.   The  fact that  the  methods pursued  by\n                \n\ngovernment agents to offer Gendron a tempting opportunity to\n\n                            -45-\n                             45\n\ncommit a crime were not  only successful but have been found\n\nby  this court  (correctly, in  my  view) not  to have  been\n\nunlawful  -- i.e.,  not to  have crossed  the line  into the\n\nforbidden realm of  entrapment -- does not,  in my judgment,\n\nsignify that those methods of enforcing this sort of statute\n\nare something to be proud of.\n\n                            -46-\n                             46\n\n                          APPENDIX\n\n         Chronology of events in the Gendron case:\n                                                 \n\n          November,  1984:     Government   agents  discover\n\nGendron's  name  on the  mailing  list  of Milton  Midge,  a\n\nsuspected child  pornography distributor.

A jury subsequently convicted Gendron of knowingly receiving child pornography through the mails.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2).  He now appeals that conviction, claiming that the child pornography statute is unconstitutional, that the government unlawfully entrapped him, and that the government's search warrant (for the tape in his house) was constitutionally defective.

Gendron points out that the Ninth Circuit has interpreted this statute as permitting a conviction of a person who does not know the child-pornographic nature of the material received, and, for that reason, has found it unconstitutional.  See United States v. X-Citement Video, 982 F.2d 1285 (9th Cir.1992), cert. granted, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1186, 127 L.Ed.2d 536 (1994).

Thomas, 893 F.2d 1066 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 826, 111 S.Ct. 80, 112 L.Ed.2d 53 (1990), considered the scope of the statute's word \"knowingly.\"   It held that \"knowingly\" modifies only the statute's word \"receives\" (or \"reproduces\"), not its subclause (A) or (B).  Consequently, it \"does not require\" that a defendant \"knew that the pornography he ... received involved a minor.\"  Id. at 1070.   Two years later, in X-Citement Video, the Ninth Circuit pointed out that the statute, as so interpreted, would permit conviction of a person who \"knowingly receives\" a video, but does not know that the video contains child pornography.  Because that interpretation would permit conviction of a person with an innocent state of mind, the court found the statute unconstitutional.  X-Citement Video, 982 F.2d at 1292;  see New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3359, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (child pornography statutes must involve \"some element of scienter\" to pass constitutional muster).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the statute is unconstitutional, however, because we do not agree with the statutory premise set forth in Thomas.   In our view, and in the view of all courts to have considered the matter since the X-Citement Video decision,  see United States v. Cochran, 17 F.3d 56 (3d Cir.1994);  United States v. Edwards, No. 92-CR-884, 1993 WL 453461 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 4, 1993);   United States v. Long, 831 F.Supp. 582 (W.D.Ky.1993);   United States v. Kempton, 826 F.Supp. 386 (D.Kan.1993);   United States v. Prytz, 822 F.Supp. 311 (D.S.C.1993), the statute's word \"knowingly\" modifies not only the word \"receives,\" but also the statute's description of the \"receive[d]\" material's pornographic content.  That is to say, we understand the statute to require for conviction that the government prove not only that the defendant \"knowingly receive[d]\" material that he knows contains a \"visual depiction\" of a person \"engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\" but also that the defendant knows that the person so depicted is a minor.   Accord Edwards, 1993 WL 453461 at * 5;   Long, 831 F.Supp. at 586;  Kempton, 826 F.Supp. at 389;   Prytz, 822 F.Supp. at 321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We concede that one cannot know automatically, simply from the position of the words in the sentence, just which of the words following \"knowingly\" the word \"knowingly\" is meant to modify.  However, that linguistic fact simply reflects the more basic fact that statements, and parts of statements, quite often derive their meaning from context.  The sentence \"John knows that people speak Spanish in Tegucigalpa, which is the capital of Honduras,\" taken by itself, leaves us uncertain whether or not John knows that Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras;  but, the context of the story in which the sentence appears, a context that includes other sentences, may clear up our uncertainty and leave us with no doubt at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when courts interpret criminal statutes, they draw upon context, including the statute's purpose and various background legal principles, to determine which states of mind accompany which particular elements of the offense.  Thus, courts normally hold that the prosecutor need not prove the defendant's state of mind in respect to \"jurisdictional facts\" (for example, that an assault victim was a federal officer, or that stolen checks moved in the mail ), whatever the mental state required for the crime's other elements.  E.g., United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 676-86, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 1259-64, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975);  Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 847, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 2363, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973);  United States v. Blassingame, 427 F.2d 329, 330 (2d Cir.1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 945, 91 S.Ct. 1629, 29 L.Ed.2d 114 (1971);  see generally S.Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 72-74 (1981).  Context (what ordinarily counts as bad behavior;  the reason why Congress mentions jurisdictional facts;  etc.), in addition to the position of words in a sentence, helps a court decide how, and when, to interpret statutes as incorporating states of mind.  See, e.g., Blassingame, 427 F.2d at 330.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background context here includes the fact that, when a criminal statute is totally silent about state of mind (as is commonly the case), courts nonetheless assume that Congress intended to require some kind of guilty knowledge with respect to major wrong-creating elements of major crimes.  Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 426, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 2088, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985) (courts should not read criminal statutes as \"requiring no mens rea\");  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 438, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 2874, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (in criminal statutes, \"far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase from the statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with an intent requirement\");  Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 255-56, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 246, 249, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, had the word \"knowingly\" not appeared at all in the child pornography statute, courts (while not insisting upon \"knowledge\" of the \"interstate commerce\" element of the offense, see supra p. 958) would have insisted nonetheless that prosecutors prove a guilty state of mind in respect to the nature of the material.  For one thing, the fact that the material shows a child engaging in sexually explicit activity is not a secondary, or jurisdictional, aspect of the crime.  It is the moral and criminal heart of the matter.  For another thing, without such a requirement, the statute would severely punish purely innocent conduct.  It would reach, for example, a post office employee who \"knowingly distributes\" mail but knows nothing of its contents, or a film developer who for some reason returns an undeveloped roll of film to a customer.  Congress could not have intended these results.  Pp. 959-960, infra;  see United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (courts must construe statutes to avoid absurd results);  United States v. Ferryman, 897 F.2d 584, 589 (1st Cir.1990) (same).  Finally, as X-Citement Video itself demonstrates, to read this criminal statute as \"requiring no mens rea\" (contrary to Liparota, 471 U.S. at 426, 105 S.Ct. at 2088) likely makes it unconstitutional.  See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 765, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3359, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (criminalization of child pornography must involve \"some element of scienter on the part of the defendant\");  see also Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 113 n. 9, 115, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1698 n. 9, 1699, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (same;  \"recklessness\" suffices).  Such an interpretation therefore violates courts' duty to interpret federal statutes so that they are consistent with the federal Constitution whenever possible.  E.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.  Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr.  Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 1397, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we would interpret a silent statute as imposing a guilty state of mind requirement, how could Congress's explicit use of the word \"knowingly\" eliminate it?   It seems far more likely that Congress used the word \"knowingly\" to make clear that it did intend to insist that a defendant know the child-pornographic nature of the material.  The legislative history confirms this view.  For example, Senator Roth, the author of the amendment which extended the original bill to distribution as well as production, was asked whether the amendment meant that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>the distributor or seller must have [either] actual knowledge that the materials do contain child pornographic depictions, or [that] he should have had such actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">He responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>That is absolutely correct.  This amendment, limited as it is by the phrase \"knowingly,\" insures that only those sellers and distributors who are consciously and deliberately engaged in the marketing of child pornography and thereby are actively contributing to the maintenance of this form of child abuse are subject to prosecution under this amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">123 Cong.Rec. 33,050 (1977) (emphasis added).  The language to which Senator Roth referred found its way into the final law (with minor stylistic changes).  Compare 123 Cong.Rec. 33,061 (1977) (Senate bill with Roth amendment) with Pub.L. No. 95-225, Sec. 2(a), 92 Stat. 7, 7-8 (1978) (final version).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Department of Justice wrote Congress a letter in which it told Congress that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>use of the word \"knowingly\" in subsection 2252(a)(1) is appropriate to make it clear that the bill does not apply to ... innocent transporters who have no knowledge of the nature or character of the material they are transporting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 438, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 40, 64 (emphasis added) [hereinafter \"Report\"].  Thus, the Department and the amendment's author agreed that the point of the statute's explicit use of the word \"knowingly\" lies in the application of that word to the nature of the material's contents, not to the nature of its distribution or receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Department also said, in a different context,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>We assume that it was not the intention of the drafters to require the Government to prove that the defendant knew the child was under age sixteen but merely to prove that the child was, in fact, less than age sixteen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 64 (emphasis added).  In saying this, however, the Department was referring to a different statutory provision--one that penalized production, not distribution.  And Congress responded by dropping the word \"knowingly\" from the production section of the statute, but not from the distribution section.  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 811, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 69, 69;  compare Pub.L. No. 95-225, Sec. 2251(a), 92 Stat. 7, 7 (1978) (knowledge not required in production prosecution) with id. Sec. 2252(a), 92 Stat. at 7-8 (knowledge required in distribution or receipt prosecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we concede that at one point the Department's letter suggests that there be no knowledge requirement with respect to age, even for distribution prosecutions.  It said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>To clarify the situation, the legislative history might reflect that the defendant's knowledge of the age of the child is not an element of the offense, but that the bill is not intended to apply to innocent transportation with no knowledge of the nature or character of the material involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Report, supra, at 29, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 64 (emphasis added).  We have found nothing in the statute or the legislative history, however, to suggest that Congress adopted this recommendation.  To the contrary, the legislative history reveals congressional awareness of the important constitutional differences between adult and child pornography, the likely constitutional significance of age, and the concomitant constitutional need for a guilty state of mind requirement with respect to age.  See, e.g., 123 Cong.Rec. 33,048 (1977) (statement of Sen.  Goldwater);  id. at 33,051 (statement of Sen.  Hatch).  In light of this background, we conclude that the statute's word \"knowingly\" applies to age as well as to conduct.  That being so, we find no constitutional obstacle to application of the statute in the case before us.  (We note that while this opinion was circulating in draft form among the members of this panel, another panel of this court reached the same conclusion.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-73 (1st Cir.1994).)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Entrapment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case demonstrated rather convincingly that Gendron ordered and received a videotape that he knew contained child pornography.  Consequently, Gendron's strongest evidence-based claim does not deny his having engaged in conduct that violates the statute.  Rather, he argues that the evidence shows the government \"entrapped\" him into doing so.  Gendron notes that the entrapment defense has two parts:  (1) the government's \"inducement\" of criminal behavior;  (2) by a defendant who was not \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812-15 (1st Cir.1988) (setting forth elements of entrapment and relevant evidentiary burdens).  Although the court submitted the entrapment issue to the jury, which found against Gendron, he argues that the evidence did not support the jury's verdict.  He says that it did not allow the government to rebut his claim of \"inducement,\" nor was it sufficient to show (beyond a reasonable doubt) his \"predisposition\" to commit the crime.  Consequently, he says, particularly in light of a recent Supreme Court case that accepted rather similar arguments, Jacobson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992), the law requires a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may help in evaluating Gendron's argument if we set forth in simplified terms our understanding of the entrapment defense and its elements.  (For more comprehensive accounts, see, e.g., Rodriguez, supra;  S.Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 118-30 (1981);  LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 5.2 (1986);  Louis M. Seidman, The Supreme Court, Entrapment, and Our Criminal Justice Dilemma, 1981 Sup.Ct.Rev. 111.)   The Supreme Court has described that defense as resting upon an assumption that Congress, when enacting criminal statutes, does not intend the statute to apply to violations arising out of (1) the government's \"abuse\" of its crime \"detection\" and law \"enforcement\" efforts by \"instigati[ng]\" the criminal behavior and \"lur[ing]\" to commit the crime (2) persons who are \"otherwise innocent.\"  Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 448, 53 S.Ct. 210, 215, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932) (emphasis added).  Consequently, the entrapment doctrine forbids punishment of an \"otherwise innocent\" person whose \"alleged offense\" is \"the product of the creative activity\" of government officials.  Id. at 451, 53 S.Ct. at 215 (emphasis added).  As the Supreme Court has recently stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>When the Government's quest for conviction leads to the apprehension of an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely would have never run afoul of the law, the courts should intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1543 (emphasis added).  Since the Court has repeatedly expressed concern about both government \"abuse\" of its enforcement powers (or the like) and the \"otherwise law-abiding citizen\" (or the like), it is not surprising that the defense has two parts, one that focuses upon government \"inducement\" and the other upon the defendant's \"predisposition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In describing \"inducement,\" courts have distinguished between proper and improper law enforcement activities.  It is proper (i.e., not an \"inducement\") for the government to use a \"sting,\" at least where it amounts to providing a defendant with an \"opportunity\" to commit a crime.  E.g., Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 441, 53 S.Ct. at 212;  Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 820, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958);  United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v. Espinal, 757 F.2d 423, 425 (1st Cir.1985).  Without this kind of law enforcement weapon, it would often prove difficult, or impossible, to stop certain seriously criminal activity, particularly activity involving drugs, or corruption, or other crimes in which no direct participant wants the crime detected.  See Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1653 n. 7, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment);  United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An improper \"inducement,\" however, goes beyond providing an ordinary \"opportunity to commit a crime.\"  Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1541.   An \"inducement\" consists of an \"opportunity\" plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.  A \"sting\" that combines an ordinary opportunity with these extra elements runs the risk of catching in the law enforcement net not only those who might well have committed the crime elsewhere (in the absence of the sting), but also those who (in its absence) likely would never have done so.  Insofar as the net catches the latter, it stretches beyond its basic law enforcement purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some examples of improper \"inducement\" may help.  Courts have found a basis for sending the entrapment issue to the jury (or finding entrapment established as a matter of law) where government officials:  (1) used \"intimidation\" and \"threats\" against a defendant's family, United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 963 (9th Cir.1993);  (2) called every day, \"began threatening\" the defendant, and were belligerent, United States v. Groll, 992 F.2d 755, 759 (7th Cir.1993);  (3) engaged in \"forceful\" solicitation and \"dogged insistence until [defendant] capitulated,\" Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 815;  (4) played upon defendant's sympathy for informant's common narcotics experience and withdrawal symptoms, Sherman, 356 U.S. at 373, 78 S.Ct. at 821;  (5) played upon sentiment of \"one former war buddy ... for another\" to get liquor (during prohibition), Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 440-41, 53 S.Ct. at 212;  (6) used \"repeated suggestions\" which succeeded only when defendant had lost his job and needed money for his family's food and rent, United States v. Kessee, 992 F.2d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir.1993);  (7) told defendant that she (the agent) was suicidal and in desperate need of money, United States v. Sullivan, 919 F.2d 1403, 1419 &amp; n. 21 (10th Cir.1990).  The background and context of each example illustrate possible government \"overreaching\"--of its having acted unfairly by employing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Model Penal Code Sec. 2.13(1)(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of the entrapment defense, \"predisposition,\" is somewhat more difficult to understand.  Some Supreme Court Justices (and the Model Penal Code's authors) have argued that \"predisposition\" is not even relevant.  Rather, they thought that the defense should focus only upon government impropriety, preventing law enforcement officers from using methods that might lead ordinary law-abiding citizens astray, whether or not the particular defendant was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  See, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 2.13;  Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 453, 53 S.Ct. at 217 (Roberts, J., joined by Brandeis &amp; Stone, JJ., concurring) (arguing for this \"objective\" view of the defense);  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 378, 78 S.Ct. at 823 (Frankfurter, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan &amp; Brennan, JJ., concurring) (same).  The Supreme Court itself, however, has rejected this view.  It saw in the entrapment defense not so much a sanction used to control police conduct, but rather a protection of the ordinary law-abiding citizen against government overreaching.  Consequently, it saw no need to permit a defendant to take advantage of that defense unless he himself was such a citizen.  See, e.g., Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 448, 53 S.Ct. at 215;  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 376-77, 78 S.Ct. at 823;  United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 433-35, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643-44, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973).  The upshot is that we must find out just who that \"innocent person\" is.  Who is the \"otherwise law-abiding citizen\" who would not \"otherwise\" have committed the crime?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question's difficulty lies in the word \"otherwise.\"   That word requires us to abstract from present circumstances.  We cannot simply ask whether, without the government's present activity, the defendant would likely have committed the crime when he did.  After all, without the government's having presented that opportunity, the defendant, no matter how \"predisposed,\" would likely not have acted then.   Nor can we simply ask whether the defendant would have acted similarly at some other time had he faced similar circumstances, since his present behavior virtually compels an affirmative answer to the question phrased in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right way to ask the question, it seems to us, is to abstract from--to assume away--the present circumstances insofar as they reveal government overreaching.   That is to say, we should ask how the defendant likely would have reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.  See Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 2.   By using the word \"ordinary,\" we mean an opportunity that lacked those special features of the government's conduct that made of it an \"inducement,\" or an \"overreaching.\"   Was the defendant \"predisposed\" to respond affirmatively to a proper, not to an improper, lure?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This way of looking at the matter seems to flow from the way in which the Supreme Court has resolved the clash between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" views of entrapment--at least if one looks at that resolution as simply denying the defense to one whom it is not designed to help, namely the kind of defendant who (without a \"sting\") might well be out committing crimes of the sort that a \"sting\" seeks to stop.  See Russell, 411 U.S. at 434, 93 S.Ct. at 1644.   Further, our effort to define \"predisposition\" through reference to the nature of the government conduct reflects the fact that, despite partial descriptions that focus primarily upon the defendant's state of mind, government misconduct lies at the heart of the entrapment defense.  Were that not so--were the issue simply the defendant's state of mind--the law would permit an innocent minded defendant to raise an entrapment claim when a private person \"induced\" him (through similar \"overreaching\" conduct) to commit a crime.  But the law does not authorize the defense in those circumstances, however \"outrageous\" the private person's conduct.  E.g., Russell, 411 U.S. at 433, 93 S.Ct. at 1643;  United States v. Jones, 950 F.2d 1309 (7th Cir.1991);  United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v. Emmert, 829 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.1987);  United States v. McLernon, 746 F.2d 1098 (6th Cir.1984);  Whiting v. United States, 321 F.2d 72, 76 (1st Cir.1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this way of phrasing the question prevents one from concluding automatically, simply from the fact that the defendant committed the crime, that he was \"predisposed\" to commit it.  At the same time, if the answer to the question so phrased is affirmative, the defendant would seem to be the sort of person (and his conduct in this instance is the sort of conduct) that the criminal statute intends to punish.  He is, in other words, someone who would likely commit the crime under the circumstances and for the reasons normally associated with that crime, and who therefore poses the sort of threat to society that the statute seeks to control, and which the government, through the \"sting,\" seeks to stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Jacobson v. United States, the recent child pornography case where the Supreme Court found entrapment as a matter of law, and upon which Gendron heavily relies.  Government agents found Jacobson's name on a bookstore mailing list that indicated that the store had mailed photos of naked children to Jacobson.  Government agents then sent Jacobson letters from fictitious people and organizations, soliciting orders for child pornography.  In three respects, however, they did more than provide an ordinary opportunity to buy child pornography:  First, the solicitations reflected a psychologically \"graduated\" set of responses to Jacobson's own noncriminal responses, beginning with innocent lures and progressing to frank offers.  The government started with a \"sexual attitude questionnaire,\" which elicited a general interest in \"pre-teen sex\";  it followed with letters containing general, nonexplicit references implying a possibility of child pornography;  it then sent Jacobson more personal correspondence;  and, finally (but after Jacobson had discontinued the correspondence), it sent him child pornography catalogues.  --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538-39.   Second, the government's soliciting letters sometimes depicted their senders as \"free speech\" lobbying organizations and fighters for the \"right to read what we desire\";  they asked Jacobson to \"fight against censorship and the infringement of individual rights.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538, 1542.   Third, the government's effort to provide an \"opportunity\" to buy child pornography stretched out over two and a half years.  Taken together, one might find in these three sets of circumstances--the graduated response, the long time period, the appeal to a proper (free speech) motive--a substantial risk of inducing an ordinary law-abiding person to commit the crime.  Indeed, the government conceded in Jacobson that its methods amounted, for entrapment purposes, to an improper \"inducement.\"  Id. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacobson's importance, however, concerns the \"predisposition\" part of the entrapment defense.  The Court held that the evidence, as a matter of law, required acquittal because a reasonable jury would have had to doubt Jacobson's predisposition.  The evidence of predisposition consisted of two facts:  (1) that before the government became involved Jacobson was on a private bookstore's mailing list for dubious photos;  and (2) that he responded affirmatively to the government's solicitations.  The first fact, the Court wrote, showed little about a predisposition to act unlawfully because ordering the photos was lawful at the time.  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542.   The second, placing orders, could not show how Jacobson would have acted had the solicitation lacked the three elements we just mentioned, namely, the improper appeals to anti-censorship motives, the graduated response, and the lengthy time frame.  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542-43.   The government therefore failed to show \"predisposition\" (beyond a reasonable doubt).  That means (as we understand it) that the government's evidence did not show how Jacobson would have acted had he been faced with an ordinary \"opportunity\" to commit the crime rather than a special \"inducement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron's case is similar to Jacobson's in two respects.  The government initially found Gendron's name on a \"naked children\" mailing list, and the government sent him child pornography solicitations over a fairly long period of time (one of the \"sham\" companies was also involved in Jacobson).   There are, however, two critical differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, any governmental \"overreaching\" here was less extensive than in Jacobson.   The government neither \"graduated\" its responses (from innocent lure to frank offer) nor, with one exception, did it appeal to any motive other than the desire to see child pornography.  The exception consists of one solicitation (also present in Jacobson) in which the government's sham company referred to \"hysterical nonsense\" about pornography, and asked why the government was \"spending millions of dollars to exercise international censorship while tons of drugs\" enter the country \"easily.\"   Nonetheless, here the government did not disguise itself as a \"sexual rights\" lobbying organization, seeking to lobby Congress to remove restraints and funding its efforts through pornographic catalogue sales.  Nor did the government ask Gendron to commit the crime as a matter of principle.  See --- U.S. at ---- - ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538-39, 1542.   Since the \"overreaching\" here was far less extensive than in Jacobson, there is less reason to believe that government \"overreaching\" (i.e., an improper \"inducement\") could lead an \"otherwise innocent\" person to commit the crime.  See Gifford, 17 F.3d at 469-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record contains substantial evidence of Gendron's state of mind;  that evidence permits the conclusion that (inducement or not) he was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  In late 1986, when Gendron first received a verbally explicit \"child pornography\" catalogue from the government's sham company, he placed an order accompanied by a letter in which he said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>I have finally found the kind of educational material I've been dreaming of possessing for quite some time.  I ... [am so] excited that I have decided to order two of your titles....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did not fill the order, but three years later Gendron responded to a letter from another sham, a pretend foreign company, which spoke of \"hard to obtain erotica.\"   He wrote,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>I am very interested in the other part of your services that are very difficult to obtain in my country....  I am becoming very bored with adult pornography....  I like very young girls only and color videos.  Can you help me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sham firm responded with an explicit child pornography catalogue, and Gendron ordered several of the titles.  (Again the government did not fill the order.)   A few months later the government sent Gendron a third explicit child pornography catalogue.  Gendron sent back an order and a check.  Two months later, he wrote again, asking if the firm had \"forgotten\" his order, making clear that he still wanted \"this type of educational materials,\" stating, \"don't worry, I am not connected in any way with law enforcement,\" and adding \"Please Hurry.\"  (This time the government filled the order with the video that led to this prosecution.)   Unlike Jacobson's correspondence, Gendron's correspondence reveals only a desire to view child pornography;  it contains nothing like Jacobson's urging of a \"counter attack\" against those \"who are determined to curtail our freedoms.\"  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538.  (See Appendix for a detailed chronology of the events in Gendron's case.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, taken together, reveals a defendant who met an initial opportunity to buy child pornography with enthusiasm, who responded to each further government initiative with a purchase order, and who, unlike Jacobson, showed no particular interest in an anti-censorship campaign.  This evidence, as we have said, permits a jury to find (beyond a reasonable doubt) that Gendron would have responded affirmatively to the most ordinary of opportunities, and, hence, was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  We therefore find the jury's entrapment decision lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Search and Seizure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government agents searched Gendron's house, and seized the primary piece of evidence (the videotape), pursuant to a warrant.  That warrant authorized (1) a search of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>the residence of Daniel A. Gendron, 105 Winthrop Street, Rehoboth, Massachusetts 02769;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">for (2) a \"VHS videocassette labeled PTL (1)\" and related items;  (3) \"after delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron\" of a specifically described parcel (containing the tape) until the expiration of the warrant (ten days after its issuance).  Gendron concedes that the warrant meets the Constitution's two basic requirements:  its issuance was supported by \"probable cause\" to believe that evidence of criminal activity would exist in his house after the delivery of the tape;  and it \"particularly describ[es] the place to be searched, and the ... things to be seized.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  IV.  He claims that it is nonetheless invalid because it is an \"anticipatory warrant\" which fails adequately to specify the time at which it will take effect.  Gendron cites in support a recent case decided by a different panel of this court, United States v. Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d 8 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the simple fact that a warrant is \"anticipatory\"--i.e., that it takes effect, not upon issuance, but at a specified future time--does not invalidate a warrant or make it somehow suspect or legally disfavored.  Warrants often do specify that they will take effect upon issuance.  But the Constitution imposes no such requirement.  Rather, it says that a search must not be \"unreasonable,\" and that warrants must be supported by \"probable cause.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  IV.  There is nothing unreasonable about authorizing a search for tomorrow, not today, when reliable information indicates that, say, the marijuana will reach the house, not now, but then.  Nor does it seem automatically unreasonable to tie the warrant's search authority to the future event that brings with it the probable cause (e.g., the time of \"delivery of a large brown package addressed to X with return address Y\").  Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 10-11.   In principle, the use of a \"triggering event\" can help assure that the search takes place only when justified by \"probable cause\";  and anticipatory warrants may thereby offer greater, not lesser, protection against unreasonable invasion of a citizen's privacy.  As one commentator has put it,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>as a general proposition the facts put forward to justify issuance of an anticipatory warrant are more likely to establish that probable cause will exist at the time of the search than the typical warrant based solely upon the known prior location of the items to be searched at the place to be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure Sec. 3.7(c), at 97 (2d ed. 1987).  Were \"anticipatory warrants\" unlawful, law enforcement agents would have to wait until the triggering event occurred;  then, if time did not permit a warrant application, they would have to forego a legitimate search, or, more likely, simply conduct the search (justified by \"exigent circumstances\") without any warrant at all.  See Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U.S. 30, 34-35, 90 S.Ct. 1969, 1971-1972, 26 L.Ed.2d 409 (1970);  2 LaFave, supra, Sec. 6.5.  We are not surprised that courts have found \"anticipatory warrants,\" considered as a class, perfectly consistent with the Constitution.  E.g., Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 10-11;  United States v. Garcia, 882 F.2d 699, 703 (2d Cir.1989);  United States v. Goodwin, 854 F.2d 33, 36 (4th Cir.1988);  United States v. Hale, 784 F.2d 1465, 1468-69 (9th Cir.1986);  People v. Glen, 30 N.Y.2d 252, 331 N.Y.S.2d 656, 659, 282 N.E.2d 614, 617 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron argues, however, that the warrant's reference to \"delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron\" does not describe with sufficient clarity its \"triggering event,\" i.e., the particular time when it will take effect.  We agree with Gendron that a warrant must clearly say when it takes effect.  We also agree that a warrant that says it takes effect upon the occurrence of a future event runs a greater risk of ambiguity than a warrant that refers only to a specific day, month, and year (as do ordinary search warrants).  That is why courts have required that the conditions upon which anticipatory warrants become effective be \"explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn.\"  Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 12 (quoting Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703-04).   That said, however, we do not find any fatal flaw in the warrant's description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the law's requirement with respect to specificity of time must be one of reasonable specificity.  Glen, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 661, 282 N.E.2d at 619 (warrant should require search to be \"reasonably contemporaneous\" with arrival of contraband);  2 LaFave, supra, Sec. 3.7(c), at 99 &amp; n. 103 (citing Glen).   One can understand how a specificity requirement in respect to time, like those in respect to \"place to be searched\" or \"things to be seized,\" U.S. Const. amend.  IV, might limit the discretion of law enforcement officers to decide when and where and what to search, thereby avoiding the \"hated general writs of assistance of pre-Revolutionary times,\" Glen, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 659, 282 N.E.2d at 617, and assuring the existence of \"probable cause.\"   2 LaFave, supra, Sec. 3.7(c), at 99;  id. Sec. 4.5, at 207;  id. Sec. 4.6(a), at 236.  But we know of no justification for a stricter standard in respect to specificity of time than in respect to the other two (constitutionally referenced) search parameters.  Ricciardelli, while stating that the contraband must be on a \"sure and irreversible course\" to the place to be searched, 998 F.2d at 13, did not purport to set forth any special new rule requiring more specificity where time, rather than, say, place, is at issue.  To the contrary, Ricciardelli says that a warrant's restrictions in respect to time and place should be \"similar.\"  Id. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the law tells us that we are to read descriptions in warrants (and in their supporting documents), not \"hypertechnical[ly],\" but in a \"commonsense\" fashion.  United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965);  see also, e.g., United States v. Bianco, 998 F.2d 1112, 1116-17 (2d Cir.1993);  In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 926 F.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir.1991);  United States v. Antone, 753 F.2d 1301, 1307 (5th Cir.1985);  United States v. Charest, 602 F.2d 1015, 1017 (1st Cir.1979).  Read in a commonsense fashion, the warrant's words seem specific and clear.  Gendron takes the word \"receipt,\" however, from the phrase \"delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron,\" and argues that it is fatally ambiguous because it might mean \"receipt\" anywhere, say, downtown or at the Post Office.  But, as we have pointed out, see supra p. 958, context helps to provide a word's meaning.  The context includes, at least, the rest of the warrant, which describes Gendron's house, makes clear that the object of the search is a video that will arrive at that house by mail, and mentions \"delivery by mail\" to that house.  Commonsense suggests that the words \"receipt by Daniel Gendron\" also refer to receipt at that house, and not to receipt downtown or at the Post Office, or (to use our own farfetched example) in Okinawa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that it is logically possible to read the word \"receipt\" as if it referred to receipt somewhere other than at Gendron's house.  But that logical fact does not make the word any less specific.  The logical fact that the world undoubtedly contains people named \"Daniel Gendron\" other than the defendant here does not mean that the warrant's triggering event, \"delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron,\" is ambiguous because it does not specify that the \"Daniel Gendron\" to whom it refers is the one residing at the address to be searched.  Despite the logical possibility that the post office might accidentally deliver the tape to some other Daniel Gendron, thus apparently fulfilling the literal terms of the warrant, the warrant is adequately specific as to the person to receive the tape.  Specificity does not lie in writing words that deny all unintended logical possibilities.  Rather, it lies in a combination of language and context, which together permit the communication of clear, simple direction.  Any effort to negate all unintended logical possibilities through the written word alone would produce linguistic complication and confusion to the point where a warrant, in practice, would fail to give the clear direction that is its very point.  That is why we must avoid reading a warrant's language \"hypertechnically.\"   See Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 109, 85 S.Ct. at 746.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it not for Ricciardelli, we would end the discussion here.  We must concede, however, that Ricciardelli found unlawfully ambiguous a warrant with virtually identical language, namely, language that triggered the warrant upon</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>delivery by mail to and receipt by Steven Ricciardelli of the ... package containing the videotape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">998 F.2d at 9.   We find a significant difference, however, in the factual context in which the warrant was issued.  The Ricciardelli panel referred to what it considered a critical fact:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>the (apparently significant) chance that the package would not be delivered to Ricciardelli's home at all--a possibility that [the postal inspectors] undeniably had envisioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 17.   The opinion also makes clear that the \"delivery by mail\" was by special delivery with a \"return receipt,\" and that the postal inspectors had \"contingency plans\" in the event that Ricciardelli received the package somewhere other than his home.  Id. at 9, 17 &amp; n. 9.  (As it happened, the \"letter carrier tried to deliver the package\" but Ricciardelli was not home, so \"the postman left a notice\" that he could \"collect the item at the post office,\" and Ricciardelli, in fact, did pick up the package at the Post Office, not at his home.  Id. at 9-10.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these background facts, one can understand why the panel might have thought the word \"receipt,\" in context, was ambiguous as to where the receipt might take place.  After all, even the highly specific language in this case describing the item to be seized, namely \"VHS videocassette labeled PTL (1),\" could be thought ambiguous if the background of this case had revealed a serious possibility of two such items (imagine that Gendron had worked for a firm called \"PTL Realty Co.\" and had taken home a series of demonstration videos).  This is simply to say that background facts can sometimes turn hypothetical possibilities, such as receipt in Okinawa or delivery to the wrong Daniel Gendron, into practical possibilities that, in context, might mean that one reading a warrant in a \"commonsense\" fashion would nonetheless find significant ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, no background fact created significant ambiguity.  On the contrary, the postal inspector's affidavit specified that the parcel \"will be placed for routine delivery\" to Gendron \"through the U.S. Postal Service, Rehoboth, MA\";  that after the parcel \"is delivered by mail and taken into the residence,\" there will be \"probable cause to believe\" that evidence of criminal conduct will be \"located\" in the house;  and that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>surveillance will commence from the time the parcel is placed for delivery [at the Rehoboth Post Office] and continue until the parcel has been delivered to 105 Winthrop St., Rehoboth, MA,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">with probable cause to search arising only \"after the parcel has entered the premises\" (emphasis added).  Moreover, at trial, the postal inspector testified that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>if Mr. Gendron was in Florida, we aren't entitled to search his house or his parents' house.  Once it was delivered into the house, then the search warrant became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He added that the house was under surveillance because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>it was important to us that if that piece didn't get delivered, you don't execute the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 115-16 (emphasis added).  Consequently, unlike Ricciardelli, nothing in the record here suggests a background in which the warrant's words, adequately specific in the context of the warrant, could, as a practical matter, convey a different meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we distinguish Ricciardelli and find that it does not control the outcome here.  To make certain that our reading of the case is correct, however, we have circulated a draft of this opinion to the entire court.  The concurring judge in Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 17 (Torruella, J., concurring) believes that his views there would require a holding in Gendron's favor here.  But, a majority of the court agrees with our reading of Ricciardelli which distinguishes that case from this one.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950-51 (1st Cir.1993).  We therefore do not accept Gendron's Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Other Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron makes three further arguments, none of which requires extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Jury Instruction.   Gendron argues that the trial court should have specifically instructed the jury that it must find he knew the person depicted on the tape was under the age of 18.  Gendron did not ask for this charge, nor did he object to the instruction the judge gave, which required the jury to find that he \"knew the character and nature of the material.\"   Nonetheless, he says that the judge's \"error\" was \"plain.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  see generally Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir.1993).  In context, however, we believe the charge the judge gave made the point that Gendron now makes.  See Estelle v. McGuire, --- U.S. ----, ---- &amp; n. 4, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482 &amp; n. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (in evaluating a jury charge, court should ask \" 'whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution,\" in light of \"the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record\") (quoting Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990)).  The jury was fully aware that the issue was child pornography.  The remainder of the charge referred frequently to children.  (Indeed, the film depicted a nine year old child.)   Thus, in all likelihood, it understood the words \"character and nature\" to encompass age as well as explicit sexual acts.  Since Gendron asked for no more and we can find no significant likelihood of prejudice, there is no plain error.  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Closing Statement.   Gendron points to two statements in the prosecutor's closing argument that, he says, are factually erroneous and significantly prejudicial.  In one instance, the prosecutor described the item that Gendron had ordered from the private mail order catalogue (sometime before 1985) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>I think the title of it was Nancy.  Nancy is described as 13, and her friends from No. 6, and No. 6 is prepubescence.  Two pretty prepubescents are taught how to become geishas.  This 10 year old, Nancy, and her friends, a 10 year old having sex with a 12 year old a delicate blond at 12, having sex with her playmate, 7, hide and seek, combat, rock.  What is his interest in this, ladies and gentlemen?   Children.  Female children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the record contains the relevant catalogue descriptions, which read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>E-2 NANCY:  13, and her friends from # 6 THROB.  An impish 10 year-old, a delicate blonde of 12, and a fetching 10 with her playmate of 7 hide-and-seek, tumble, and romp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>J-6 KIMONO I:  Two pretty pubescents are taught how to become geishas.  From full costume and make-up to nudity.  Some censoring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron's argument centers on the absence of the phrase \"having sex\" in the actual descriptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the other instance, the prosecutor described the pornographic tape that the government sent Gendron as containing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>explicit depictions of a 9 to 11 year old girl being raped, being sexually abused, by teenage boys and an adult male.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the tape does not contain depictions of forcible rape (although, as the government points out, its depictions of a child engaging in sex amount to \"statutory rape\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Gendron that the prosecutor's statements were wrong and that she should not have made them.  We cannot agree, however, that they entitle Gendron to a new trial.  That is because Gendron did not object to the statements at the time.  Had he done so, we are certain that the district court would have ordered a correction, and a correction would have cured any harm by pointing out the facts.  In the absence of an objection, however, we will normally not order a new trial unless there is a \"substantial chance that absent the error the jury would have acquitted,\" or, for some other reason, we fear a \"miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985);  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.   We see no such miscarriage, nor any significant likelihood of acquittal, here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case was strong, perhaps overwhelming.  The jury saw portions of the tape, which portrays a nine year old girl engaging in sexually explicit activities with teenage and adult men.  Gendron says nothing to suggest that the tape leaves any doubt about the unlawful nature of its contents. Thus, in this particular case, we do not think the single use of the word \"rape,\" forceful as it is, could have had any significant prejudicial impact on the jury beyond the impact of the tape itself.  The question of the videotape descriptions, because of their relevance to the \"predisposition\" element of Gendron's entrapment defense, is a little closer.  But, as we have described, supra p. 964, the evidence of predisposition was very strong.  We do not believe the misdescription of the original mail order would likely have had any practical effect on the jury's \"no entrapment\" finding, particularly because the correct description was admitted into evidence and available to the jury.  In light of the strength of the government's case (\"an important factor in considering the likely effect of borderline rhetoric,\" United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987)), whether we consider the two misstatements separately or together, the \"error\" they reflect is not \"plain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Other Erotica.   Gendron argues that the court erred in allowing, as evidence of \"predisposition,\" various \"child erotic\" (but not illegal) items seized at his home.  He does not seriously argue, however, that the items were not relevant.  See Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542 (stating that similar material \"by itself\" was not sufficient to show predisposition).  Rather, he says their usefulness was outweighed by their tendency to prejudice the jury.  Fed.R.Evid. 403.  The balancing at issue, however, is for the district court, not this court.  United States v. Williams, 985 F.2d 634, 637 (1st Cir.1993).  The court might reasonably have concluded, in light of the nature of the basic evidence in the case (the videotape itself), that the nature of the additional child-erotic material made no significant prejudicial difference.  We find no abuse of discretion in this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron's additional arguments are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>Chronology of events in the Gendron case:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">November, 1984:  Government agents discover Gendron's name on the mailing list of Milton Midge, a suspected child pornography distributor.

I would add only a few words.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First.  As the court's opinion makes clear, constitutional difficulties of serious dimension would attend the child-pornography statute if, in prosecutions for knowing receipt of a \"visual depiction\" of \"a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2), the phrase \"knowingly receives\" were not construed as requiring the government to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the \"visual depiction\" was one which the defendant knew to involve, not just pornography, but child pornography.  These potential constitutional difficulties are obviated by the court's persuasive demonstration of \"congressional awareness of the important constitutional differences between adult and child pornography,\" with the result that, as the court concludes, the proper reading of what Congress wrote is \"that the statute's word 'knowingly' applies to age as well as conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, appellant Gendron contends that the pertinent aspect of the charge given by the trial court--namely that the government was required to prove that Gendron \"knew the character and nature of the material\"--was deficient in that it did not say expressly that the government had to have proved that Gendron knew that one of the actors depicted in the videotape was a minor.  But, as the court notes, Gendron did not request such an instruction.  Moreover, as the court shows, it is highly unlikely that the jury could have failed to understand that the central focus of the charge was that Gendron was eager to acquire, and through the government's good offices ultimately did acquire, a videotape depicting child pornography.  That is to say, in the case at bar the fact that the trial court did not give the more particularized charge that appellant did not request cannot realistically be supposed to have affected the jury's deliberations in a fashion detrimental to appellant.  In future trials under this statute, defendants will presumably request, and trial courts will surely give, a more particularized statement of what \"knowingly\" comprehends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.  The fact that the methods pursued by government agents to offer Gendron a tempting opportunity to commit a crime were not only successful but have been found by this court (correctly, in my view) not to have been unlawful--i.e., not to have crossed the line into the forbidden realm of entrapment--does not, in my judgment, signify that those methods of enforcing this sort of statute are something to be proud of.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

A jury subsequently convicted Gendron of knowingly receiving child pornography through the mails.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2).  He now appeals that conviction, claiming that the child pornography statute is unconstitutional, that the government unlawfully entrapped him, and that the government's search warrant (for the tape in his house) was constitutionally defective.

Consequently, it \"does not require\" that a defendant \"knew that the pornography he ... received involved a minor.\"  Id. at 1070.   Two years later, in X-Citement Video, the Ninth Circuit pointed out that the statute, as so interpreted, would permit conviction of a person who \"knowingly receives\" a video, but does not know that the video contains child pornography.  Because that interpretation would permit conviction of a person with an innocent state of mind, the court found the statute unconstitutional.  X-Citement Video, 982 F.2d at 1292;  see New York v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></span> (D.S.C.1993), the statute's word \"knowingly\" modifies not only the word \"receives,\" but also the statute's description of the \"receive[d]\" material's pornographic content.  That is to say, we understand the statute to require for conviction that the government prove not only that the defendant \"knowingly receive[d]\" material that he knows contains a \"visual depiction\" of a person \"engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\" but also that the defendant knows that the person so depicted is a minor.   Accord Edwards, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">453461</span></span> at * 5;   Long, 831 F.Supp. at 586;  Kempton, 826 F.Supp. at 389;   Prytz, 822 F.Supp. at 321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We concede that one cannot know automatically, simply from the position of the words in the sentence, just which of the words following \"knowingly\" the word \"knowingly\" is meant to modify.  However, that linguistic fact simply reflects the more basic fact that statements, and parts of statements, quite often derive their meaning from context.  The sentence \"John knows that people speak Spanish in Tegucigalpa, which is the capital of Honduras,\" taken by itself, leaves us uncertain whether or not John knows that Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras;  but, the context of the story in which the sentence appears, a context that includes other sentences, may clear up our uncertainty and leave us with no doubt at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when courts interpret criminal statutes, they draw upon context, including the statute's purpose and various background legal principles, to determine which states of mind accompany which particular elements of the offense.  Thus, courts normally hold that the prosecutor need not prove the defendant's state of mind in respect to \"jurisdictional facts\" (for example, that an assault victim was a federal officer, or that stolen checks moved in the mail ), whatever the mental state required for the crime's other elements.

Context (what ordinarily counts as bad behavior;  the reason why Congress mentions jurisdictional facts;  etc.), in addition to the position of words in a sentence, helps a court decide how, and when, to interpret statutes as incorporating states of mind.

For one thing, the fact that the material shows a child engaging in sexually explicit activity is not a secondary, or jurisdictional, aspect of the crime.  It is the moral and criminal heart of the matter.  For another thing, without such a requirement, the statute would severely punish purely innocent conduct.  It would reach, for example, a post office employee who \"knowingly distributes\" mail but knows nothing of its contents, or a film developer who for some reason returns an undeveloped roll of film to a customer.  Congress could not have intended these results.  Pp. 959-960, infra;  see United States v.

Finally, as X-Citement Video itself demonstrates, to read this criminal statute as \"requiring no mens rea\" (contrary to Liparota, 471 U.S. at 426, 105 S.Ct. at 2088) likely makes it unconstitutional.

It seems far more likely that Congress used the word \"knowingly\" to make clear that it did intend to insist that a defendant know the child-pornographic nature of the material.  The legislative history confirms this view.  For example, Senator Roth, the author of the amendment which extended the original bill to distribution as well as production, was asked whether the amendment meant that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>the distributor or seller must have [either] actual knowledge that the materials do contain child pornographic depictions, or [that] he should have had such actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">He responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>That is absolutely correct.  This amendment, limited as it is by the phrase \"knowingly,\" insures that only those sellers and distributors who are consciously and deliberately engaged in the marketing of child pornography and thereby are actively contributing to the maintenance of this form of child abuse are subject to prosecution under this amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">123 Cong.Rec. 33,050 (1977) (emphasis added).  The language to which Senator Roth referred found its way into the final law (with minor stylistic changes).  Compare 123 Cong.Rec. 33,061 (1977) (Senate bill with Roth amendment) with Pub.L. No. 95-225, Sec. 2(a), 92 Stat. 7, 7-8 (1978) (final version).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Department of Justice wrote Congress a letter in which it told Congress that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>use of the word \"knowingly\" in subsection 2252(a)(1) is appropriate to make it clear that the bill does not apply to ... innocent transporters who have no knowledge of the nature or character of the material they are transporting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 438, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 40, 64 (emphasis added) [hereinafter \"Report\"].  Thus, the Department and the amendment's author agreed that the point of the statute's explicit use of the word \"knowingly\" lies in the application of that word to the nature of the material's contents, not to the nature of its distribution or receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Department also said, in a different context,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>We assume that it was not the intention of the drafters to require the Government to prove that the defendant knew the child was under age sixteen but merely to prove that the child was, in fact, less than age sixteen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 64 (emphasis added).  In saying this, however, the Department was referring to a different statutory provision--one that penalized production, not distribution.  And Congress responded by dropping the word \"knowingly\" from the production section of the statute, but not from the distribution section.  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 811, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 69, 69;  compare Pub.L. No. 95-225, Sec. 2251(a), 92 Stat. 7, 7 (1978) (knowledge not required in production prosecution) with id. Sec. 2252(a), 92 Stat. at 7-8 (knowledge required in distribution or receipt prosecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we concede that at one point the Department's letter suggests that there be no knowledge requirement with respect to age, even for distribution prosecutions.  It said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>To clarify the situation, the legislative history might reflect that the defendant's knowledge of the age of the child is not an element of the offense, but that the bill is not intended to apply to innocent transportation with no knowledge of the nature or character of the material involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Report, supra, at 29, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 64 (emphasis added).  We have found nothing in the statute or the legislative history, however, to suggest that Congress adopted this recommendation.  To the contrary, the legislative history reveals congressional awareness of the important constitutional differences between adult and child pornography, the likely constitutional significance of age, and the concomitant constitutional need for a guilty state of mind requirement with respect to age.  See, e.g., 123 Cong.Rec. 33,048 (1977) (statement of Sen.  Goldwater);  id. at 33,051 (statement of Sen.  Hatch).  In light of this background, we conclude that the statute's word \"knowingly\" applies to age as well as to conduct.  That being so, we find no constitutional obstacle to application of the statute in the case before us.  (We note that while this opinion was circulating in draft form among the members of this panel, another panel of this court reached the same conclusion.  See United States v. Gifford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 471-73 (1st Cir.1994).)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Entrapment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case demonstrated rather convincingly that Gendron ordered and received a videotape that he knew contained child pornography.  Consequently, Gendron's strongest evidence-based claim does not deny his having engaged in conduct that violates the statute.  Rather, he argues that the evidence shows the government \"entrapped\" him into doing so.  Gendron notes that the entrapment defense has two parts:  (1) the government's \"inducement\" of criminal behavior;  (2) by a defendant who was not \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 812-15 (1st Cir.1988) (setting forth elements of entrapment and relevant evidentiary burdens).  Although the court submitted the entrapment issue to the jury, which found against Gendron, he argues that the evidence did not support the jury's verdict.  He says that it did not allow the government to rebut his claim of \"inducement,\" nor was it sufficient to show (beyond a reasonable doubt) his \"predisposition\" to commit the crime.  Consequently, he says, particularly in light of a recent Supreme Court case that accepted rather similar arguments, Jacobson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(For more comprehensive accounts, see, e.g., Rodriguez, supra;  S.Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 118-30 (1981);  LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 5.2 (1986);  Louis M. Seidman, The Supreme Court, Entrapment, and Our Criminal Justice Dilemma, 1981 Sup.Ct.Rev. 111.)   The Supreme Court has described that defense as resting upon an assumption that Congress, when enacting criminal statutes, does not intend the statute to apply to violations arising out of (1) the government's \"abuse\" of its crime \"detection\" and law \"enforcement\" efforts by \"instigati[ng]\" the criminal behavior and \"lur[ing]\" to commit the crime (2) persons who are \"otherwise innocent.\"  Sorrells v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101997\"><a href=\"/opinion/101997/sorrells-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 448, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101997\"><a href=\"/opinion/101997/sorrells-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span> (1932) (emphasis added).  Consequently, the entrapment doctrine forbids punishment of an \"otherwise innocent\" person whose \"alleged offense\" is \"the product of the creative activity\" of government officials.  Id. at 451, 53 S.Ct. at 215 (emphasis added).  As the Supreme Court has recently stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>When the Government's quest for conviction leads to the apprehension of an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely would have never run afoul of the law, the courts should intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1543 (emphasis added).  Since the Court has repeatedly expressed concern about both government \"abuse\" of its enforcement powers (or the like) and the \"otherwise law-abiding citizen\" (or the like), it is not surprising that the defense has two parts, one that focuses upon government \"inducement\" and the other upon the defendant's \"predisposition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In describing \"inducement,\" courts have distinguished between proper and improper law enforcement activities.  It is proper (i.e., not an \"inducement\") for the government to use a \"sting,\" at least where it amounts to providing a defendant with an \"opportunity\" to commit a crime.  E.g., Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 441, 53 S.Ct. at 212;  Sherman v.

Without this kind of law enforcement weapon, it would often prove difficult, or impossible, to stop certain seriously criminal activity, particularly activity involving drugs, or corruption, or other crimes in which no direct participant wants the crime detected.  See Hampton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109437\"><a href=\"/opinion/109437/hampton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 495 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109437\"><a href=\"/opinion/109437/hampton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An \"inducement\" consists of an \"opportunity\" plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.  A \"sting\" that combines an ordinary opportunity with these extra elements runs the risk of catching in the law enforcement net not only those who might well have committed the crime elsewhere (in the absence of the sting), but also those who (in its absence) likely would never have done so.  Insofar as the net catches the latter, it stretches beyond its basic law enforcement purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some examples of improper \"inducement\" may help.  Courts have found a basis for sending the entrapment issue to the jury (or finding entrapment established as a matter of law) where government officials:  (1) used \"intimidation\" and \"threats\" against a defendant's family, United States v. Becerra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606083\"><a href=\"/opinion/606083/united-states-v-jose-becerra-salvatore-larizza-gabriel-becerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 963 (9th Cir.1993);  (2) called every day, \"began threatening\" the defendant, and were belligerent, United States v.

Kessee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606095\"><a href=\"/opinion/606095/united-states-v-harold-kessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span>, 1003 (9th Cir.1993);  (7) told defendant that she (the agent) was suicidal and in desperate need of money, United States v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552246\"><a href=\"/opinion/552246/united-states-v-russell-sullivan-mary-ann-sullivan-eugene-lewis-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span>, 1419 &amp; n. 21 (10th Cir.1990).  The background and context of each example illustrate possible government \"overreaching\"--of its having acted unfairly by employing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Model Penal Code Sec. 2.13(1)(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of the entrapment defense, \"predisposition,\" is somewhat more difficult to understand.  Some Supreme Court Justices (and the Model Penal Code's authors) have argued that \"predisposition\" is not even relevant.  Rather, they thought that the defense should focus only upon government impropriety, preventing law enforcement officers from using methods that might lead ordinary law-abiding citizens astray, whether or not the particular defendant was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  See, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 2.13;  Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 453, 53 S.Ct. at 217 (Roberts, J., joined by Brandeis &amp; Stone, JJ., concurring) (arguing for this \"objective\" view of the defense);  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 378, 78 S.Ct. at 823 (Frankfurter, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan &amp; Brennan, JJ., concurring) (same).  The Supreme Court itself, however, has rejected this view.  It saw in the entrapment defense not so much a sanction used to control police conduct, but rather a protection of the ordinary law-abiding citizen against government overreaching.  Consequently, it saw no need to permit a defendant to take advantage of that defense unless he himself was such a citizen.  See, e.g., Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 448, 53 S.Ct. at 215;  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 376-77, 78 S.Ct. at 823;  United States v. Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108768\"><a href=\"/opinion/108768/united-states-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 433-35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108768\"><a href=\"/opinion/108768/united-states-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Who is the \"otherwise law-abiding citizen\" who would not \"otherwise\" have committed the crime?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question's difficulty lies in the word \"otherwise.\"   That word requires us to abstract from present circumstances.  We cannot simply ask whether, without the government's present activity, the defendant would likely have committed the crime when he did.  After all, without the government's having presented that opportunity, the defendant, no matter how \"predisposed,\" would likely not have acted then.   Nor can we simply ask whether the defendant would have acted similarly at some other time had he faced similar circumstances, since his present behavior virtually compels an affirmative answer to the question phrased in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right way to ask the question, it seems to us, is to abstract from--to assume away--the present circumstances insofar as they reveal government overreaching.   That is to say, we should ask how the defendant likely would have reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.  See Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 2.   By using the word \"ordinary,\" we mean an opportunity that lacked those special features of the government's conduct that made of it an \"inducement,\" or an \"overreaching.\"   Was the defendant \"predisposed\" to respond affirmatively to a proper, not to an improper, lure?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This way of looking at the matter seems to flow from the way in which the Supreme Court has resolved the clash between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" views of entrapment--at least if one looks at that resolution as simply denying the defense to one whom it is not designed to help, namely the kind of defendant who (without a \"sting\") might well be out committing crimes of the sort that a \"sting\" seeks to stop.  See Russell, 411 U.S. at 434, 93 S.Ct. at 1644.   Further, our effort to define \"predisposition\" through reference to the nature of the government conduct reflects the fact that, despite partial descriptions that focus primarily upon the defendant's state of mind, government misconduct lies at the heart of the entrapment defense.  Were that not so--were the issue simply the defendant's state of mind--the law would permit an innocent minded defendant to raise an entrapment claim when a private person \"induced\" him (through similar \"overreaching\" conduct) to commit a crime.  But the law does not authorize the defense in those circumstances, however \"outrageous\" the private person's conduct.  E.g., Russell, 411 U.S. at 433, 93 S.Ct. at 1643;  United States v.

At the same time, if the answer to the question so phrased is affirmative, the defendant would seem to be the sort of person (and his conduct in this instance is the sort of conduct) that the criminal statute intends to punish.  He is, in other words, someone who would likely commit the crime under the circumstances and for the reasons normally associated with that crime, and who therefore poses the sort of threat to society that the statute seeks to control, and which the government, through the \"sting,\" seeks to stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Jacobson v. United States, the recent child pornography case where the Supreme Court found entrapment as a matter of law, and upon which Gendron heavily relies.  Government agents found Jacobson's name on a bookstore mailing list that indicated that the store had mailed photos of naked children to Jacobson.  Government agents then sent Jacobson letters from fictitious people and organizations, soliciting orders for child pornography.  In three respects, however, they did more than provide an ordinary opportunity to buy child pornography:  First, the solicitations reflected a psychologically \"graduated\" set of responses to Jacobson's own noncriminal responses, beginning with innocent lures and progressing to frank offers.  The government started with a \"sexual attitude questionnaire,\" which elicited a general interest in \"pre-teen sex\";  it followed with letters containing general, nonexplicit references implying a possibility of child pornography;  it then sent Jacobson more personal correspondence;  and, finally (but after Jacobson had discontinued the correspondence), it sent him child pornography catalogues.  --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538-39.   Second, the government's soliciting letters sometimes depicted their senders as \"free speech\" lobbying organizations and fighters for the \"right to read what we desire\";  they asked Jacobson to \"fight against censorship and the infringement of individual rights.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538, 1542.   Third, the government's effort to provide an \"opportunity\" to buy child pornography stretched out over two and a half years.  Taken together, one might find in these three sets of circumstances--the graduated response, the long time period, the appeal to a proper (free speech) motive--a substantial risk of inducing an ordinary law-abiding person to commit the crime.  Indeed, the government conceded in Jacobson that its methods amounted, for entrapment purposes, to an improper \"inducement.\"  Id. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacobson's importance, however, concerns the \"predisposition\" part of the entrapment defense.  The Court held that the evidence, as a matter of law, required acquittal because a reasonable jury would have had to doubt Jacobson's predisposition.  The evidence of predisposition consisted of two facts:  (1) that before the government became involved Jacobson was on a private bookstore's mailing list for dubious photos;  and (2) that he responded affirmatively to the government's solicitations.  The first fact, the Court wrote, showed little about a predisposition to act unlawfully because ordering the photos was lawful at the time.  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542.   The second, placing orders, could not show how Jacobson would have acted had the solicitation lacked the three elements we just mentioned, namely, the improper appeals to anti-censorship motives, the graduated response, and the lengthy time frame.  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542-43.   The government therefore failed to show \"predisposition\" (beyond a reasonable doubt).  That means (as we understand it) that the government's evidence did not show how Jacobson would have acted had he been faced with an ordinary \"opportunity\" to commit the crime rather than a special \"inducement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron's case is similar to Jacobson's in two respects.  The government initially found Gendron's name on a \"naked children\" mailing list, and the government sent him child pornography solicitations over a fairly long period of time (one of the \"sham\" companies was also involved in Jacobson).   There are, however, two critical differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, any governmental \"overreaching\" here was less extensive than in Jacobson.   The government neither \"graduated\" its responses (from innocent lure to frank offer) nor, with one exception, did it appeal to any motive other than the desire to see child pornography.  The exception consists of one solicitation (also present in Jacobson) in which the government's sham company referred to \"hysterical nonsense\" about pornography, and asked why the government was \"spending millions of dollars to exercise international censorship while tons of drugs\" enter the country \"easily.\"   Nonetheless, here the government did not disguise itself as a \"sexual rights\" lobbying organization, seeking to lobby Congress to remove restraints and funding its efforts through pornographic catalogue sales.  Nor did the government ask Gendron to commit the crime as a matter of principle.  See --- U.S. at ---- - ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538-39, 1542.   Since the \"overreaching\" here was far less extensive than in Jacobson, there is less reason to believe that government \"overreaching\" (i.e., an improper \"inducement\") could lead an \"otherwise innocent\" person to commit the crime.  See Gifford, 17 F.3d at 469-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record contains substantial evidence of Gendron's state of mind;  that evidence permits the conclusion that (inducement or not) he was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  In late 1986, when Gendron first received a verbally explicit \"child pornography\" catalogue from the government's sham company, he placed an order accompanied by a letter in which he said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>I have finally found the kind of educational material I've been dreaming of possessing for quite some time.  I ... [am so] excited that I have decided to order two of your titles....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did not fill the order, but three years later Gendron responded to a letter from another sham, a pretend foreign company, which spoke of \"hard to obtain erotica.\"   He wrote,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>I am very interested in the other part of your services that are very difficult to obtain in my country....  I am becoming very bored with adult pornography....  I like very young girls only and color videos.  Can you help me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sham firm responded with an explicit child pornography catalogue, and Gendron ordered several of the titles.  (Again the government did not fill the order.)   A few months later the government sent Gendron a third explicit child pornography catalogue.  Gendron sent back an order and a check.  Two months later, he wrote again, asking if the firm had \"forgotten\" his order, making clear that he still wanted \"this type of educational materials,\" stating, \"don't worry, I am not connected in any way with law enforcement,\" and adding \"Please Hurry.\"  (This time the government filled the order with the video that led to this prosecution.)   Unlike Jacobson's correspondence, Gendron's correspondence reveals only a desire to view child pornography;  it contains nothing like Jacobson's urging of a \"counter attack\" against those \"who are determined to curtail our freedoms.\"  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1538.  (See Appendix for a detailed chronology of the events in Gendron's case.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, taken together, reveals a defendant who met an initial opportunity to buy child pornography with enthusiasm, who responded to each further government initiative with a purchase order, and who, unlike Jacobson, showed no particular interest in an anti-censorship campaign.  This evidence, as we have said, permits a jury to find (beyond a reasonable doubt) that Gendron would have responded affirmatively to the most ordinary of opportunities, and, hence, was \"predisposed\" to commit the crime.  We therefore find the jury's entrapment decision lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Search and Seizure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government agents searched Gendron's house, and seized the primary piece of evidence (the videotape), pursuant to a warrant.  That warrant authorized (1) a search of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>the residence of Daniel A. Gendron, 105 Winthrop Street, Rehoboth, Massachusetts 02769;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">for (2) a \"VHS videocassette labeled PTL (1)\" and related items;  (3) \"after delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron\" of a specifically described parcel (containing the tape) until the expiration of the warrant (ten days after its issuance).  Gendron concedes that the warrant meets the Constitution's two basic requirements:  its issuance was supported by \"probable cause\" to believe that evidence of criminal activity would exist in his house after the delivery of the tape;  and it \"particularly describ[es] the place to be searched, and the ... things to be seized.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  IV.  He claims that it is nonetheless invalid because it is an \"anticipatory warrant\" which fails adequately to specify the time at which it will take effect.  Gendron cites in support a recent case decided by a different panel of this court, United States v. Ricciardelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610895\"><a href=\"/opinion/610895/united-states-v-steven-ricciardelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the simple fact that a warrant is \"anticipatory\"--i.e., that it takes effect, not upon issuance, but at a specified future time--does not invalidate a warrant or make it somehow suspect or legally disfavored.  Warrants often do specify that they will take effect upon issuance.  But the Constitution imposes no such requirement.  Rather, it says that a search must not be \"unreasonable,\" and that warrants must be supported by \"probable cause.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  IV.  There is nothing unreasonable about authorizing a search for tomorrow, not today, when reliable information indicates that, say, the marijuana will reach the house, not now, but then.  Nor does it seem automatically unreasonable to tie the warrant's search authority to the future event that brings with it the probable cause (e.g., the time of \"delivery of a large brown package addressed to X with return address Y\").  Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 10-11.   In principle, the use of a \"triggering event\" can help assure that the search takes place only when justified by \"probable cause\";  and anticipatory warrants may thereby offer greater, not lesser, protection against unreasonable invasion of a citizen's privacy.  As one commentator has put it,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>as a general proposition the facts put forward to justify issuance of an anticipatory warrant are more likely to establish that probable cause will exist at the time of the search than the typical warrant based solely upon the known prior location of the items to be searched at the place to be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure Sec. 3.7(c), at 97 (2d ed. 1987).  Were \"anticipatory warrants\" unlawful, law enforcement agents would have to wait until the triggering event occurred;  then, if time did not permit a warrant application, they would have to forego a legitimate search, or, more likely, simply conduct the search (justified by \"exigent circumstances\") without any warrant at all.

Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108183\"><a href=\"/opinion/108183/vale-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34-35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108183\"><a href=\"/opinion/108183/vale-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agree with Gendron that a warrant must clearly say when it takes effect.  We also agree that a warrant that says it takes effect upon the occurrence of a future event runs a greater risk of ambiguity than a warrant that refers only to a specific day, month, and year (as do ordinary search warrants).  That is why courts have required that the conditions upon which anticipatory warrants become effective be \"explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn.\"  Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 12 (quoting Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703-04).   That said, however, we do not find any fatal flaw in the warrant's description.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the law's requirement with respect to specificity of time must be one of reasonable specificity.  Glen, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 661, 282 N.E.2d at 619 (warrant should require search to be \"reasonably contemporaneous\" with arrival of contraband);  2 LaFave, supra, Sec. 3.7(c), at 99 &amp; n. 103 (citing Glen).   One can understand how a specificity requirement in respect to time, like those in respect to \"place to be searched\" or \"things to be seized,\" U.S. Const. amend.  IV, might limit the discretion of law enforcement officers to decide when and where and what to search, thereby avoiding the \"hated general writs of assistance of pre-Revolutionary times,\" Glen, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 659, 282 N.E.2d at 617, and assuring the existence of \"probable cause.\"   2 LaFave, supra, Sec. 3.7(c), at 99;  id. Sec. 4.5, at 207;  id. Sec. 4.6(a), at 236.  But we know of no justification for a stricter standard in respect to specificity of time than in respect to the other two (constitutionally referenced) search parameters.  Ricciardelli, while stating that the contraband must be on a \"sure and irreversible course\" to the place to be searched, 998 F.2d at 13, did not purport to set forth any special new rule requiring more specificity where time, rather than, say, place, is at issue.  To the contrary, Ricciardelli says that a warrant's restrictions in respect to time and place should be \"similar.\"  Id. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the law tells us that we are to read descriptions in warrants (and in their supporting documents), not \"hypertechnical[ly],\" but in a \"commonsense\" fashion.

Read in a commonsense fashion, the warrant's words seem specific and clear.  Gendron takes the word \"receipt,\" however, from the phrase \"delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron,\" and argues that it is fatally ambiguous because it might mean \"receipt\" anywhere, say, downtown or at the Post Office.  But, as we have pointed out, see supra p. 958, context helps to provide a word's meaning.  The context includes, at least, the rest of the warrant, which describes Gendron's house, makes clear that the object of the search is a video that will arrive at that house by mail, and mentions \"delivery by mail\" to that house.  Commonsense suggests that the words \"receipt by Daniel Gendron\" also refer to receipt at that house, and not to receipt downtown or at the Post Office, or (to use our own farfetched example) in Okinawa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that it is logically possible to read the word \"receipt\" as if it referred to receipt somewhere other than at Gendron's house.  But that logical fact does not make the word any less specific.  The logical fact that the world undoubtedly contains people named \"Daniel Gendron\" other than the defendant here does not mean that the warrant's triggering event, \"delivery by mail to and receipt by Daniel Gendron,\" is ambiguous because it does not specify that the \"Daniel Gendron\" to whom it refers is the one residing at the address to be searched.  Despite the logical possibility that the post office might accidentally deliver the tape to some other Daniel Gendron, thus apparently fulfilling the literal terms of the warrant, the warrant is adequately specific as to the person to receive the tape.  Specificity does not lie in writing words that deny all unintended logical possibilities.  Rather, it lies in a combination of language and context, which together permit the communication of clear, simple direction.  Any effort to negate all unintended logical possibilities through the written word alone would produce linguistic complication and confusion to the point where a warrant, in practice, would fail to give the clear direction that is its very point.  That is why we must avoid reading a warrant's language \"hypertechnically.\"   See Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 109, 85 S.Ct. at 746.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it not for Ricciardelli, we would end the discussion here.  We must concede, however, that Ricciardelli found unlawfully ambiguous a warrant with virtually identical language, namely, language that triggered the warrant upon</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>delivery by mail to and receipt by Steven Ricciardelli of the ... package containing the videotape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">998 F.2d at 9.   We find a significant difference, however, in the factual context in which the warrant was issued.  The Ricciardelli panel referred to what it considered a critical fact:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>the (apparently significant) chance that the package would not be delivered to Ricciardelli's home at all--a possibility that [the postal inspectors] undeniably had envisioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 17.   The opinion also makes clear that the \"delivery by mail\" was by special delivery with a \"return receipt,\" and that the postal inspectors had \"contingency plans\" in the event that Ricciardelli received the package somewhere other than his home.  Id. at 9, 17 &amp; n. 9.  (As it happened, the \"letter carrier tried to deliver the package\" but Ricciardelli was not home, so \"the postman left a notice\" that he could \"collect the item at the post office,\" and Ricciardelli, in fact, did pick up the package at the Post Office, not at his home.  Id. at 9-10.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these background facts, one can understand why the panel might have thought the word \"receipt,\" in context, was ambiguous as to where the receipt might take place.  After all, even the highly specific language in this case describing the item to be seized, namely \"VHS videocassette labeled PTL (1),\" could be thought ambiguous if the background of this case had revealed a serious possibility of two such items (imagine that Gendron had worked for a firm called \"PTL Realty Co.\" and had taken home a series of demonstration videos).  This is simply to say that background facts can sometimes turn hypothetical possibilities, such as receipt in Okinawa or delivery to the wrong Daniel Gendron, into practical possibilities that, in context, might mean that one reading a warrant in a \"commonsense\" fashion would nonetheless find significant ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, no background fact created significant ambiguity.  On the contrary, the postal inspector's affidavit specified that the parcel \"will be placed for routine delivery\" to Gendron \"through the U.S. Postal Service, Rehoboth, MA\";  that after the parcel \"is delivered by mail and taken into the residence,\" there will be \"probable cause to believe\" that evidence of criminal conduct will be \"located\" in the house;  and that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>surveillance will commence from the time the parcel is placed for delivery [at the Rehoboth Post Office] and continue until the parcel has been delivered to 105 Winthrop St., Rehoboth, MA,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">with probable cause to search arising only \"after the parcel has entered the premises\" (emphasis added).  Moreover, at trial, the postal inspector testified that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>if Mr. Gendron was in Florida, we aren't entitled to search his house or his parents' house.  Once it was delivered into the house, then the search warrant became effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He added that the house was under surveillance because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>it was important to us that if that piece didn't get delivered, you don't execute the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 115-16 (emphasis added).  Consequently, unlike Ricciardelli, nothing in the record here suggests a background in which the warrant's words, adequately specific in the context of the warrant, could, as a practical matter, convey a different meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we distinguish Ricciardelli and find that it does not control the outcome here.  To make certain that our reading of the case is correct, however, we have circulated a draft of this opinion to the entire court.  The concurring judge in Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 17 (Torruella, J., concurring) believes that his views there would require a holding in Gendron's favor here.  But, a majority of the court agrees with our reading of Ricciardelli which distinguishes that case from this one.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 950-51 (1st Cir.1993).  We therefore do not accept Gendron's Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Other Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron makes three further arguments, none of which requires extended discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Jury Instruction.   Gendron argues that the trial court should have specifically instructed the jury that it must find he knew the person depicted on the tape was under the age of 18.  Gendron did not ask for this charge, nor did he object to the instruction the judge gave, which required the jury to find that he \"knew the character and nature of the material.\"   Nonetheless, he says that the judge's \"error\" was \"plain.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  see generally Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 528 (1st Cir.1993).  In context, however, we believe the charge the judge gave made the point that Gendron now makes.  See Estelle v.

(Indeed, the film depicted a nine year old child.)   Thus, in all likelihood, it understood the words \"character and nature\" to encompass age as well as explicit sexual acts.  Since Gendron asked for no more and we can find no significant likelihood of prejudice, there is no plain error.

Gendron points to two statements in the prosecutor's closing argument that, he says, are factually erroneous and significantly prejudicial.  In one instance, the prosecutor described the item that Gendron had ordered from the private mail order catalogue (sometime before 1985) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>I think the title of it was Nancy.  Nancy is described as 13, and her friends from No. 6, and No. 6 is prepubescence.  Two pretty prepubescents are taught how to become geishas.

We cannot agree, however, that they entitle Gendron to a new trial.  That is because Gendron did not object to the statements at the time.  Had he done so, we are certain that the district court would have ordered a correction, and a correction would have cured any harm by pointing out the facts.  In the absence of an objection, however, we will normally not order a new trial unless there is a \"substantial chance that absent the error the jury would have acquitted,\" or, for some other reason, we fear a \"miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1985);  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.   We see no such miscarriage, nor any significant likelihood of acquittal, here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case was strong, perhaps overwhelming.  The jury saw portions of the tape, which portrays a nine year old girl engaging in sexually explicit activities with teenage and adult men.  Gendron says nothing to suggest that the tape leaves any doubt about the unlawful nature of its contents. Thus, in this particular case, we do not think the single use of the word \"rape,\" forceful as it is, could have had any significant prejudicial impact on the jury beyond the impact of the tape itself.  The question of the videotape descriptions, because of their relevance to the \"predisposition\" element of Gendron's entrapment defense, is a little closer.  But, as we have described, supra p. 964, the evidence of predisposition was very strong.  We do not believe the misdescription of the original mail order would likely have had any practical effect on the jury's \"no entrapment\" finding, particularly because the correct description was admitted into evidence and available to the jury.  In light of the strength of the government's case (\"an important factor in considering the likely effect of borderline rhetoric,\" United States v. Mejia-Lozano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir.1987)), whether we consider the two misstatements separately or together, the \"error\" they reflect is not \"plain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Other Erotica.   Gendron argues that the court erred in allowing, as evidence of \"predisposition,\" various \"child erotic\" (but not illegal) items seized at his home.  He does not seriously argue, however, that the items were not relevant.  See Jacobson, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1542 (stating that similar material \"by itself\" was not sufficient to show predisposition).  Rather, he says their usefulness was outweighed by their tendency to prejudice the jury.  Fed.R.Evid. 403.  The balancing at issue, however, is for the district court, not this court.  United States v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600261\"><a href=\"/opinion/600261/united-states-v-olgivie-obrien-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span>, 637 (1st Cir.1993).  The court might reasonably have concluded, in light of the nature of the basic evidence in the case (the videotape itself), that the nature of the additional child-erotic material made no significant prejudicial difference.  We find no abuse of discretion in this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron's additional arguments are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>Chronology of events in the Gendron case:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">November, 1984:  Government agents discover Gendron's name on the mailing list of Milton Midge, a suspected child pornography distributor.

As the court's opinion makes clear, constitutional difficulties of serious dimension would attend the child-pornography statute if, in prosecutions for knowing receipt of a \"visual depiction\" of \"a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2), the phrase \"knowingly receives\" were not construed as requiring the government to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the \"visual depiction\" was one which the defendant knew to involve, not just pornography, but child pornography.  These potential constitutional difficulties are obviated by the court's persuasive demonstration of \"congressional awareness of the important constitutional differences between adult and child pornography,\" with the result that, as the court concludes, the proper reading of what Congress wrote is \"that the statute's word 'knowingly' applies to age as well as conduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, appellant Gendron contends that the pertinent aspect of the charge given by the trial court--namely that the government was required to prove that Gendron \"knew the character and nature of the material\"--was deficient in that it did not say expressly that the government had to have proved that Gendron knew that one of the actors depicted in the videotape was a minor.  But, as the court notes, Gendron did not request such an instruction.  Moreover, as the court shows, it is highly unlikely that the jury could have failed to understand that the central focus of the charge was that Gendron was eager to acquire, and through the government's good offices ultimately did acquire, a videotape depicting child pornography.  That is to say, in the case at bar the fact that the trial court did not give the more particularized charge that appellant did not request cannot realistically be supposed to have affected the jury's deliberations in a fashion detrimental to appellant.  In future trials under this statute, defendants will presumably request, and trial courts will surely give, a more particularized statement of what \"knowingly\" comprehends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.  The fact that the methods pursued by government agents to offer Gendron a tempting opportunity to commit a crime were not only successful but have been found by this court (correctly, in my view) not to have been unlawful--i.e., not to have crossed the line into the forbidden realm of entrapment--does not, in my judgment, signify that those methods of enforcing this sort of statute are something to be proud of.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
