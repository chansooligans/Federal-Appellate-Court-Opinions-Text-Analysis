DiManno, pro  se appellant,\n                     \n\nappeals from the district  court's dismissal of his complaint\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1915(d).   The  main issue is whether\n\nthis action arises  under federal patent  laws.  We  conclude\n\nthat further proceedings are required.\n\n                              I\n\n          Appellant's complaint sought a declaratory judgment\n\nwith  respect  to  two  documents concerning  U.S.  patent  #\n\n4,339,138  (\"the  Patent\").     The  first  document  was  an\n\nExclusive  License Agreement  (the  \"License\")  entered  into\n\nbetween   appellant   and  appellee   Throtonics  Corporation\n\n(\"Throtonics\").   That  agreement,  dated June  1, 1988,  and\n\nsigned  by  both  parties, provided  that  appellant  granted\n\nThrotonics the right \"to manufacture, have manufactured, use,\n\nmarket, have marketed, sell and have sold devices based on or\n\nrelating to  the Invention.\"  Appellant's  complaint sought a\n\ndeclaration that  the License was  \"legally insignificant  on\n\nthe grounds  that a patent  assignment is superior  in rights\n\nand  law to  a patent  license.\"   Appellant asserted  in his\n\ncomplaint  that appellees  had claimed  an assignment  of the\n\nsame patent by appellant  and could not claim both  a license\n\nand an assignment.  Appellant also sought a declaration  that\n\nthe License  failed as an assignment.\n\n          The second document with respect to which appellant\n\nsought a declaration was  an Assignment of Proprietary Patent\n\n                             -2-\n\nRights  (the \"Assignment\").   The  Assignment, dated  June 1,\n\n1988,  and signed by appellant as the assignor, provided that\n\n\"[t]he Assignor hereby  wholly and unconditionally transfers,\n\nsells and assigns to [Throtonics] all rights of ownership  of\n\nthe Assignor under the said  U.S. Patent number 4,339,138 and\n\nany and all other proprietary rights or any further rights.\" \n\nThe Assignment was not recorded with the Patent and Trademark\n\nOffice  until November 24, 1989.    Meanwhile,  in a document\n\ndated September 28, 1989,  and signed by appellant, appellant\n\nassigned \"the entire right  title and interest . .  . in U.S.\n\nLetters Patent  No. 4,339,138\"  to  Kozmos, Inc.  (\"Kozmos\").\n\nThe assignment  to Kozmos  was recorded  with the  Patent and\n\nTrademark  Office on  September 29,  1989, two  months before\n\nrecordation of the Assignment to Throtonics.\n\n          Appellant's complaint sought a declaration that the\n\nAssignment was \"without legal standing as being abandoned, as\n\nlacking the essential elements of a patent assignment, and as\n\nbeing  superseded by a prior assignment of the  patent.\"     \n\nAppellant contended that,  pursuant to 35  U.S.C.   261,  the\n\nassignment to  Kozmos voided any claim  Throtonics might have\n\nhad to  a patent assignment.1   Appellant requested  that the\n\n                    \n\n1.  35 U.S.C.   261 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n       261.  Ownership; assignment\n\n     An assignment, grant or conveyance shall be void as\n     against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a\n     valuable consideration, without  notice, unless  it\n\n                             -3-\n\ndistrict  court  declare that  neither  the  License nor  the\n\nAssignment  could be the basis for a patent infringement suit\n\nby appellees.\n\n                              II\n\n          There is  no diversity  of citizenship between  the\n\nparties.   The sole basis of  federal jurisdiction claimed in\n\nthe complaint was  28 U.S.C.    1338(a), which gives  federal\n\ndistrict courts jurisdiction  over any  civil action  arising\n\nunder  any Act of Congress relating to patents.  The district\n\ncourt determined  that it lacked  subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover appellant's  claims.   In  determining that  appellant's\n\naction  was subject to dismissal under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d) as\n\nbased  upon  an  indisputably  meritless  legal  theory,  the\n\ndistrict court reasoned as follows:\n\n          [t]his  is  precisely  the   same  action\n          brought by plaintiff against Jay Such and\n          Throtonics in Civil Action  No. 91-10099-\n          WD [sic].  That  action was dismissed for\n          lack of subject  matter jurisdiction.  In\n          the instant complaint, plaintiff  has not\n          alleged any new legal theories that would\n          provide  this  court with  subject matter\n          jurisdiction.2\n\n                    \n\n     is recorded  in  the Patent  and  Trademark  Office\n     within  three months from its  date or prior to the\n     date of such subsequent purchase or mortgage.\n\n2.  Although the  district  court  concluded  that  this  was\n\"precisely the same action\" as an action previously dismissed\nfor lack  of subject matter jurisdiction,  the district court\ndid not expressly base its 1915(d)  dismissal on res judicata\ngrounds.  For that reason, we  do not rule on the question of\nwhether  a 1915(d)  dismissal on  res judicata  grounds would\nhave been appropriate.   In addition, we question whether the\n\n                             -4-\n\nThe    district   court   denied   appellant's   motion   for\n\nreconsideration. \n\n                             III\n\n          The issue  on appeal is whether  the district court\n\nabused its  discretion in  concluding that appellant's  claim\n\nthat his  action \"arises under\"  the federal patent  laws was\n\nbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory.  The Supreme\n\nCourt has  defined the  requirements for \"arising  under\" the\n\nfederal patent laws as follows:\n\n          [Section]  1338(a)  jurisdiction  .  .  .\n          extend[s] only to those  cases in which a\n          well-pleaded complaint establishes either\n          that federal patent law creates the cause\n          of action  or that the  plaintiff's right\n          to   relief    necessarily   depends   on\n          resolution of a  substantial question  of\n          federal patent law, in that patent law is\n          a necessary  element of one of  the well-\n          pleaded claims.\n\nChristianson v.  Colt Indus.  Operating Corp., 486  U.S. 800,\n                                             \n\n808-809 (1988).  \n\n          There is a plausible legal argument that patent law\n\nis a \"necessary element\" of at least one of appellant's well-\n\npleaded  claims.   Therefore, we  conclude that  the district\n\n                    \n\nfirst case was  properly dismissed for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.   The  complaint  in that  case claimed  patent\ninfringement.  In Kunkel v.  Topmaster Int'l, Inc., 906  F.2d\n                                                  \n693,  697 (Fed.  Cir. 1990), the  court held that  all that a\nplaintiff needs to do to invoke federal jurisdiction is plead\nthe  elements  required  by  the patent  laws  for  a  patent\ninfringement claim.  That  \"'a question of contract  law must\nbe decided  prior to reaching the  infringement question does\nnot  defeat  subject  matter  jurisdiction.'\"  Id.  (citation\n                                                  \nomitted).  \n\n                             -5-\n\ncourt  erred  in  dismissing  this action  under     1915(d).\n\nAppellant claimed that the Assignment is void under 35 U.S.C.\n\n   261  because it  was  not  recorded prior  to  appellant's\n\nassignment  of  the  patent  to  Kozmos.    To  determine the\n\nvalidity  of  the Assignment,  the  district  court would  be\n\nrequired to  construe a federal  patent statute, 35  U.S.C.  \n\n261.  The  Supreme Court has held that  where the validity of\n\nan assignment  depends upon construction of  the patent laws,\n\nit  is a question  arising under the patent  laws.  Crown Dye\n                                                             \n\nand Tool Co.  v. Nye Tool  &amp; Machine Works,  261 U.S. 24,  33\n                                          \n\n(1923).\n\n          Unlike,  for  example,  the complaint  in  Combs v.\n                                                          \n\nPlough,  Inc.,  681 F.2d  469  (6th  Cir. 1982),  appellant's\n             \n\ncomplaint  does  not  allege  that  the  Assignment  is  void\n\nexclusively for the reason that it was fraudulently obtained.\n\nSuch  a fraud claim would clearly arise only under state law.\n\nIn this  case, however, appellant's  complaint alleges, among\n\nother claims, that the  assignment is void under 35  U.S.C.  \n\n261.   Construction of   261 is a question  of federal patent\n\nlaw.  See FilmTec Corp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 939 F.2d 1568\n                                              \n\n(Fed.  Cir.  1991)  (remanding  case to  district  court  and\n\nclarifying the requirements  for creation  of an  enforceable\n\nassignment  under    261).   Therefore, it  is arguable  that\n\npatent law is a necessary element of one of appellant's well-\n\n                             -6-\n\npleaded claims and that the district court had subject matter\n\njurisdiction under   1338(a).\n\n          Nor is jurisdiction clearly lacking for the  reason\n\nthat \"but  for the  availability of the  declaratory judgment\n\nprocedure, the Federal claim would arise only as a defense to\n\na state created action.\"  10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane,\n\nFederal  Practice and  Procedure    2767, at  744-45  (2d ed.\n                                \n\n1983);  see  American   Policyholders  Ins.  Co.  v.   Nyacol\n                                                             \n\nProducts,  Inc., No. 92-1949, slip. op. at 13 (1st Cir., Feb.\n               \n\n24, 1993).  The claim that the Assignment is void would arise\n\nas a defense to a patent infringement action by appellees.  A\n\npatent infringement action is clearly a federal action.  And,\n\naccording to the complaint, appellees had threatened to bring\n\nsuch an action.\n\n          We do not decide whether appellant has succeeded in\n\nestablishing  subject matter jurisdiction.  Nor do  we decide\n\nwhether res judicata or any  other defenses are available  to\n\nappellees.   We  decide  only that  appellant's legal  theory\n\nunder which  subject matter jurisdiction could be established\n\nis  not \"indisputably  meritless\"  and  that, therefore,  the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in dismissing  the complaint  under 28\n\nU.S.C.   1915(d) on this basis.   Accordingly, we remand this\n\ncase  to   the  district   court  for  continuation   of  the\n\nproceedings.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          The  district  court's      1915(d)  dismissal   is\n\nreversed.\n        \n\n                             -8-\n",

In addition, we question whether the\n\n                             -4-\n\nThe    district   court   denied   appellant's   motion   for\n\nreconsideration. \n\n                             III\n\n          The issue  on appeal is whether  the district court\n\nabused its  discretion in  concluding that appellant's  claim\n\nthat his  action \"arises under\"  the federal patent  laws was\n\nbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory.  The Supreme\n\nCourt has  defined the  requirements for \"arising  under\" the\n\nfederal patent laws as follows:\n\n          [Section]  1338(a)  jurisdiction  .  .  .\n          extend[s] only to those  cases in which a\n          well-pleaded complaint establishes either\n          that federal patent law creates the cause\n          of action  or that the  plaintiff's right\n          to   relief    necessarily   depends   on\n          resolution of a  substantial question  of\n          federal patent law, in that patent law is\n          a necessary  element of one of  the well-\n          pleaded claims.\n\nChristianson v.
