Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                        \n\n   Andrew and Priscilla Tempelman on brief pro se.\n                                 \n   Michael  L.  Paup,  Acting Assistant  Attorney  General, Tax\n                    \nDivision,  Gary  R.  Allen, Charles  E.  Brookhart  and  Scott P.\n                                                               \nTowers, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department  of Justice, on brief\n    \nfor appellees.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.   Plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal  of a\n               \n\ncomplaint  in  which  they  advanced   three  related  claims\n\npertaining to a tax lien.  As the lien has now been lifted (a\n\nfact first disclosed  only after judgment by way  of a motion\n\nfor  reconsideration), their claim under 28  U.S.C.   2410 to\n\n\"quiet title\"  to property is  now moot.   In turn,  we agree\n\nwith the district court that,  as set forth in the complaint,\n\nboth the refund claim (brought under  28 U.S.C.   1346 and 26\n\nU.S.C.   7422) and the damages claim (brought under 26 U.S.C.\n\n   7432) were barred  on jurisdictional grounds,  given that,\n\ninter alia, the underlying assessments were never paid.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., McMillen v. U.S. Dep't  of Treasury, 960 F.2d 187, 188-\n                                         \n\n90 (1st Cir. 1991) (per  curiam).  And considering the timing\n\nof the  disclosure as  to the lien's  release, we  cannot say\n\nthat the court  abused its discretion  in denying the  motion\n\nfor  reconsideration,  particularly  since  such  denial  was\n\nwithout prejudice to the filing of a new action  under   7432\n\n(or some related provision) with regard to such release.  \n\n     We  need not now decide whether the normal prerequisites\n\nto such a suit--exhaustion of administrative remedies, see 26\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.      7432(d)(1),   and  payment   of  the   underlying\n\nassessment, see McMillen,  960 F.2d at 190--might  be subject\n                        \n\nto  relaxation in  cases  where the  lien has  been released.\n\nSee,  e.g., Information Resources, Inc. v. United States, 950\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1122, 1125-27  (5th Cir.  1992).   Nor  need we  decide\n\n                             -2-\n\nwhether, to  the extent  that the assessments  at issue  here\n\ninvolved only corporate taxes, plaintiffs would have standing\n\nas private individuals to pursue  such relief.  See, e.g., 26\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.   7432(a)  (authorizing suit by taxpayer  for improper\n\nfailure to release lien \"on property of the taxpayer\"); In re\n                                                             \n\nLas  Colinas  Devel.
