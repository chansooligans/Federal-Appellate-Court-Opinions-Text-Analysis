This case  is before us  on\n                                  \n\npetition to review  a decision  and order of  the National  Labor\n\nRelations  Board (the  \"Board\") filed  by Cumberland  Farms, Inc.\n\n(the  \"Company\"),  and  the  cross-application of  the  Board  to\n\nenforce  its order.1  The  Board found that  the Company violated\n\n    8(a)(1)  and (3)  of the  National  Labor Relations  Act (the\n\n\"Act\"),  29  U.S.C.    58(a)(1)  and (3)  (1973), by  engaging in\n\ncoercive  interrogation of  its employees  regarding their  union\n\nactivities,  discharging employees  because of  these activities,\n\nand threatening  to arrest  a  union agent  while he  distributed\n\nhandbills on public property.  Accordingly, the Board ordered the\n\nCompany to reinstate the discharged employees with back  pay, and\n\nto post notices admitting these violations and disclaiming future\n\nillegal action.\n\n          The  Company  challenges  the findings  of  the  Board,\n\nclaiming that they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord considered  as a whole.   We disagree and  thus affirm the\n\nBoard's order.  \n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          The  record  supports   the  Board's  finding   of  the\n\nfollowing facts.  The Company owns a dairy business that operates\n\nfour  plants,  including one  in Florence,  New  Jersey.   In the\n\nsummer  of 1990, the  United Food  and Commercial  Workers, Local\n\n1360, United Food and Commercial  Worker's International, AFL-CIO\n\n(the \"Union\") began  organizing in  this plant.   Two  employees,\n\n                    \n\n1  The  Board's order is reported at Cumberland  Farms, Inc., 307\nN.L.R.B. 231 (1992).\n\nJohn Mariano  and John  Bartosh, distributed  union authorization\n\ncards to the employees.\n\n          Shortly after they  began the  membership drive,  their\n\nimmediate  supervisor, Company  foreman John  Messner, questioned\n\nthem on several occasions  regarding their actions and progress.2\n\nThomas  Sweeney,  the Company's  Human  Resources Director,  also\n\nquestioned Mariano about his union activities  in the presence of\n\nBartosh.3    Mariano  and Bartosh admitted  involvement with  the\n\ndrive.  \n\n          On August  3, 1990, six days after  Mariano and Bartosh\n\nbegan distributing Union authorization cards, the  Company issued\n\na letter to  the employees urging them not to  sign. At 5:30 p.m.\n\nof the same day,  Emanuel Cavaco, the Company's Manager  of Dairy\n\nOperations, Robert Wood, the Florence plant manager, Sweeney, and\n\nplant engineer Allen Canney met with Mariano in a conference room\n\nand  stated   that  they   had  received  complaints   about  his\n\ndistribution of  union authorization  cards.  Mariano   responded\n\nthat  he  distributed  them  during  non-working  time.    Cavaco\n\ncontended, however, that given the number of complaints received,\n\nhe  must have engaged in these activities during working hours as\n\nwell.    The  meeting  became more  confrontational  when  Cavaco\n\n                    \n\n2   On one occasion, Messner  said, \"I heard you  guys are giving\nout  union  cards.    I'm  all  for  the  union;  how's  the guys\nresponding?      Are  you getting  a  lot  signed?\"   On  another\noccasion,  he said:  \"How are you guys doing?  Have you got a lot\nof  cards signed?   How's the guys  responding?  I'm  all for the\nunion.\"\n\n3  Sweeney  asked, \"Hey, John, .  . . anything new  I should know\nabout around here, like the union?\"\n\n                               -3-\n\naccused  Mariano of  violating  a  Company no-solicitation  rule.\n\nAfter further questioning  Cavaco stated, \"John, we  took you out\n\nof the  cooler;  we put  you  in with  the maintenance  to  learn\n\nsomething, and this is how you repay us.  Do you have anything to\n\nsay  for yourself?\"  When  Mariano said no,  Cavaco suspended him\n\nindefinitely.   Wood and  Canney then  escorted  Mariano off  the\n\nproperty and  denied him access to his locker.  Upon reaching the\n\ngate  Wood  said, \"John,  didn't we  just  speak [about  a salary\n\nincrease] a . . . week before  this - and then you pull something\n\nlike this?  Do you have anything to say?\"  Mariano left with  the\n\nimpression that the Company  would further investigate.  However,\n\na  week later,  although  no further  inquiry  was made,  Mariano\n\nreceived  a  letter from  the Company  terminating  him due  to a\n\n\"comprehensive   investigation  concerning   the  no-solicitation\n\npolicies.\"\n\n          On the day that Mariano was suspended, Cavaco, Sweeney,\n\nand Wood  subjected Bartosh to a  similar interrogation regarding\n\nalleged  complaints   against  him  for  violation   of  the  no-\n\nsolicitation rule.  Bartosh flatly denied these charges.   Cavaco\n\nreminded Bartosh that the Company treated him favorably by moving\n\nhim to  the maintenance department  and that  he therefore  \"owed\n\nthem.\"   Bartosh was then escorted off the Company premises after\n\nhe  locked his  tools.   When  Bartosh returned  to the  plant to\n\nretrieve  his  tools,  Wood fired  him  for  having  solicited on\n\ncompany property.\n\n          On  August 16,  various non-employee  union organizers,\n\n                               -4-\n\nincluding Mariano and Bartosh, distributed union handbills on the\n\npublic highway near  the Company's plant entrance.   Although the\n\norganizers  were  on  public  property,  three  Company  security\n\nofficers  told one of them that they were on Company property and\n\nwould be  arrested if they did not leave.  When they arrived, the\n\nFlorence police officers indicated  that the handbillers were not\n\nviolating the law.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                          \n\n          We uphold the  Board's findings of a  violation as long\n\nas substantial evidence on  the record as a whole  supports them,\n\neven if we would have reached a  different conclusion.  29 U.S.C.\n\n   160(e) and (f).\n\n                             ANALYSIS\n                                     \n\nI.  Coercive Interrogation\n\n          Section  8(a)(1) of  the  Act  protects employees  from\n\ncoercive interrogation regarding their union activities.  NLRB v.\n                                                              \n\nOtis Hosp.,  545 F.2d 252, 256 (1st Cir. 1976).  The existence of\n          \n\ncoercion is generally a factual issue and depends on the totality\n\nof  the   circumstances,  id.,  including  the   setting  of  the\n                             \n\ninterrogation  and  the  status  of the  interrogators.    P.S.C.\n                                                                 \n\nResources, Inc. v.  NLRB, 576 F.2d 380, 383 (1st  Cir. 1978).  An\n                        \n\ninterrogation need  not contain explicit threats  to be coercive.\n\nNLRB v. Gogin, 575 F.2d 596, 600 (7th Cir. 1978).  \n             \n\n          Given  the  circumstances  of  this   case,  we  cannot\n\nconclude that the evidence does not  support the Board's findings\n\nregarding the coercive nature  of the interrogations.  A  team of\n\n                               -5-\n\nhigh level managers confronted  Mariano and Bartosh shortly after\n\nthey  began their  concerted  activities,  questioned them  about\n\ntheir  Union  affiliation,  and  accused   them  of  ingratitude.\n\nMoreover, during the confrontations, the managers  denied Mariano\n\nand  Bartosh access to the evidence against them, and in essence,\n\ndenied them  an opportunity  to defend themselves.   Accordingly,\n\nthe Board reasonably found the interrogations coercive.\n\nII.  Interfering with lawful Union activities\n\n          An employer lacks a  legitimate interest in interfering\n\nwith  union  activities  which  occur away  from  the  employer's\n\nproperty.  Threatening  to call  the police, in  the presence  of\n\nemployees, to  interfere with lawful union  activity violates the\n\nAct.  NLRB v.  Schlegel Oklahoma, Inc., 644  F.2d 842, 843  (10th\n                                      \n\nCir. 1981).    In the  present  case, Company  security  officers\n\nthreatened to  have the  union organizers  arrested  in front  of\n\nMariano and  Bartosh, who  as unfair labor  practice dischargees,\n\ncontinued  to retain employee status under the Act, see 29 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n\n  152(3).   Accordingly, the  Board correctly concluded  that the\n\nthreat violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.\n\nIII.  Discharge\n\n          When an  employer discharges an employee for supporting\n\na union, he  violates the Act,  29 U.S.C    158(a)(3), unless  he\n\nproves that he would have taken the same action in the absence of\n\nthe employee's union activities.   NLRB v. Amber Delivery  Serv.,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 651 F.2d 57, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1981).  The  employer fails to\n    \n\nmeet this burden,  however, if the proposed reason  for discharge\n\n                               -6-\n\nis shown to  be a mere pretext to  disguise discrimination.  NLRB\n                                                                 \n\nv. Pilgrim Foods, Inc., 591 F.2d 110, 118 (1st Cir. 1979)\n                      \n\n          In reaching its determination  on motive, the Board may\n\nconsider the timing of the discharge, id. at 117, any differences\n                                         \n\nin the application of disciplinary  rules, NLRB v. S.E.  Nichols,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 862  F.2d 952, 959  (2d Cir. 1988), cert.  denied, 490 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n1108 (1989), the procedures used for  discharge, NLRB v. American\n                                                                 \n\nSpring Bed  Mfg. Co., 670  F.2d 1236,  1245 (1st Cir.  1982), the\n                    \n\ninvestigation of  the purported reasons for  the discharge, Sioux\n                                                                 \n\nProducts, Inc. v.  NLRB, 684 F.2d 1251, 1259 (7th Cir. 1982), and\n                       \n\nthe purported justifications for  the ultimate actions.  American\n                                                                 \n\nSpring Bed Mfg. Co., 670 F.2d at 1245.\n                   \n\n          We conclude that substantial  evidence on the record as\n\na whole supports the Board's findings regarding the discharges of\n\nMariano and Bartosh.  The Company  admits that it  discharged the\n\nemployees for distributing union authorization cards.  It argues,\n\nhowever, that  by distributing  those cards, Mariano  and Bartosh\n\nwere soliciting,  and  that the  no-solicitation  rule  therefore\n\njustified the discharges.  \n\n          We  conclude,  as did  the  Board,  that the  Company's\n\nreliance on  the no-solicitation rule  was a  pretext to  justify\n\ndischarges for engaging  in union activity.   At the time of  the\n\ndischarges,  the Company knew  that Mariano and  Bartosh were the\n\nin-plant  leaders  of the  union's  organizational  effort.   The\n\nCompany then  coercively  interrogated them  and then  discharged\n\nthem based solely upon a cursory investigation, affording them no\n\n                               -7-\n\nopportunity to defend themselves.  Moreover,     the    Company's\n\nemployees  were generally  unaware of  the no-solicitation  rule,\n\nmuch  less its enforcement.  Indeed, Mariano and Bartosh were the\n\nonly  employees that  the  Company ever  disciplined for  alleged\n\nviolations of  the no-solicitation rule.   Accordingly, the Board\n\nreasonably determined that the  no-solicitation rule was merely a\n\npretextual justification for an illegal discharge.\n\n          In a  final  attempt to  salvage  the validity  of  the\n\ndischarges, the Company claimed  that Mariano and Bartosh engaged\n\nin time card irregularities.  However, the Company failed to even\n\nmention this  serious accusation  at the  time of  the employees'\n\ndischarges.   Thus, the Board  reasonably afforded  no credit  to\n\nthis argument.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          We have  considered all  other allegations made  by the\n\nCompany  and conclude that they lack merit.  The Board's judgment\n\nwas  rational and effectively promotes the  goals of the Act.  As\n\nsuch, we affirm the Board's order.\n\n          The  petition  for review  is  denied  and the  Board's\n                                               \n\nrequest for enforcement of its order is granted.\n                                               \n\n          Costs to the Board.\n\n                               -8-\n",

This case  is before us  on\n                                  \n\npetition to review  a decision  and order of  the National  Labor\n\nRelations  Board (the  \"Board\") filed  by Cumberland  Farms, Inc.\n\n(the  \"Company\"),  and  the  cross-application of  the  Board  to\n\nenforce  its order.1  The  Board found that  the Company violated\n\n    8(a)(1)  and (3)  of the  National  Labor Relations  Act (the\n\n\"Act\"),  29  U.S.C.    58(a)(1)  and (3)  (1973), by  engaging in\n\ncoercive  interrogation of  its employees  regarding their  union\n\nactivities,  discharging employees  because of  these activities,\n\nand threatening  to arrest  a  union agent  while he  distributed\n\nhandbills on public property.  Accordingly, the Board ordered the\n\nCompany to reinstate the discharged employees with back  pay, and\n\nto post notices admitting these violations and disclaiming future\n\nillegal action.\n\n          The  Company  challenges  the findings  of  the  Board,\n\nclaiming that they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord considered  as a whole.   We disagree and  thus affirm the\n\nBoard's order.  \n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          The  record  supports   the  Board's  finding   of  the\n\nfollowing facts.  The Company owns a dairy business that operates\n\nfour  plants,  including one  in Florence,  New  Jersey.   In the\n\nsummer  of 1990, the  United Food  and Commercial  Workers, Local\n\n1360, United Food and Commercial  Worker's International, AFL-CIO\n\n(the \"Union\") began  organizing in  this plant.   Two  employees,\n\n                    \n\n1  The  Board's order is reported at Cumberland  Farms, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992).\n\nJohn Mariano  and John  Bartosh, distributed  union authorization\n\ncards to the employees.\n\n          Shortly after they  began the  membership drive,  their\n\nimmediate  supervisor, Company  foreman John  Messner, questioned\n\nthem on several occasions  regarding their actions and progress.2\n\nThomas  Sweeney,  the Company's  Human  Resources Director,  also\n\nquestioned Mariano about his union activities  in the presence of\n\nBartosh.3    Mariano  and Bartosh admitted  involvement with  the\n\ndrive.  \n\n          On August  3, 1990, six days after  Mariano and Bartosh\n\nbegan distributing Union authorization cards, the  Company issued\n\na letter to  the employees urging them not to  sign. At 5:30 p.m.\n\nof the same day,  Emanuel Cavaco, the Company's Manager  of Dairy\n\nOperations, Robert Wood, the Florence plant manager, Sweeney, and\n\nplant engineer Allen Canney met with Mariano in a conference room\n\nand  stated   that  they   had  received  complaints   about  his\n\ndistribution of  union authorization  cards.  Mariano   responded\n\nthat  he  distributed  them  during  non-working  time.    Cavaco\n\ncontended, however, that given the number of complaints received,\n\nhe  must have engaged in these activities during working hours as\n\nwell.    The  meeting  became more  confrontational  when  Cavaco\n\n                    \n\n2   On one occasion, Messner  said, \"I heard you  guys are giving\nout  union  cards.    I'm  all  for  the  union;  how's  the guys\nresponding?      Are  you getting  a  lot  signed?\"   On  another\noccasion,  he said:  \"How are you guys doing?  Have you got a lot\nof  cards signed?   How's the guys  responding?  I'm  all for the\nunion.\"\n\n3  Sweeney  asked, \"Hey, John, .  . . anything new  I should know\nabout around here, like the union?\"\n\n                               -3-\n\naccused  Mariano of  violating  a  Company no-solicitation  rule.\n\nAfter further questioning  Cavaco stated, \"John, we  took you out\n\nof the  cooler;  we put  you  in with  the maintenance  to  learn\n\nsomething, and this is how you repay us.  Do you have anything to\n\nsay  for yourself?\"  When  Mariano said no,  Cavaco suspended him\n\nindefinitely.   Wood and  Canney then  escorted  Mariano off  the\n\nproperty and  denied him access to his locker.  Upon reaching the\n\ngate  Wood  said, \"John,  didn't we  just  speak [about  a salary\n\nincrease] a . . . week before  this - and then you pull something\n\nlike this?  Do you have anything to say?\"  Mariano left with  the\n\nimpression that the Company  would further investigate.  However,\n\na  week later,  although  no further  inquiry  was made,  Mariano\n\nreceived  a  letter from  the Company  terminating  him due  to a\n\n\"comprehensive   investigation  concerning   the  no-solicitation\n\npolicies.\"\n\n          On the day that Mariano was suspended, Cavaco, Sweeney,\n\nand Wood  subjected Bartosh to a  similar interrogation regarding\n\nalleged  complaints   against  him  for  violation   of  the  no-\n\nsolicitation rule.  Bartosh flatly denied these charges.   Cavaco\n\nreminded Bartosh that the Company treated him favorably by moving\n\nhim to  the maintenance department  and that  he therefore  \"owed\n\nthem.\"   Bartosh was then escorted off the Company premises after\n\nhe  locked his  tools.   When  Bartosh returned  to the  plant to\n\nretrieve  his  tools,  Wood fired  him  for  having  solicited on\n\ncompany property.\n\n          On  August 16,  various non-employee  union organizers,\n\n                               -4-\n\nincluding Mariano and Bartosh, distributed union handbills on the\n\npublic highway near  the Company's plant entrance.   Although the\n\norganizers  were  on  public  property,  three  Company  security\n\nofficers  told one of them that they were on Company property and\n\nwould be  arrested if they did not leave.  When they arrived, the\n\nFlorence police officers indicated  that the handbillers were not\n\nviolating the law.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                          \n\n          We uphold the  Board's findings of a  violation as long\n\nas substantial evidence on  the record as a whole  supports them,\n\neven if we would have reached a  different conclusion.  29 U.S.C.\n\n   160(e) and (f).\n\n                             ANALYSIS\n                                     \n\nI.  Coercive Interrogation\n\n          Section  8(a)(1) of  the  Act  protects employees  from\n\ncoercive interrogation regarding their union activities.  NLRB v.\n                                                              \n\nOtis Hosp.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340654\"><a href=\"/opinion/340654/national-labor-relations-board-v-otis-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (1st Cir. 1976).  The existence of\n          \n\ncoercion is generally a factual issue and depends on the totality\n\nof  the   circumstances,  id.,  including  the   setting  of  the\n                             \n\ninterrogation  and  the  status  of the  interrogators.    P.S.C.\n                                                                 \n\nResources, Inc. v.

An\n                        \n\ninterrogation need  not contain explicit threats  to be coercive.\n\nNLRB v. Gogin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355548\"><a href=\"/opinion/355548/national-labor-relations-board-v-gerald-g-gogin-dba-gogin-trucking/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (7th Cir. 1978).  \n             \n\n          Given  the  circumstances  of  this   case,  we  cannot\n\nconclude that the evidence does not  support the Board's findings\n\nregarding the coercive nature  of the interrogations.  A  team of\n\n                               -5-\n\nhigh level managers confronted  Mariano and Bartosh shortly after\n\nthey  began their  concerted  activities,  questioned them  about\n\ntheir  Union  affiliation,  and  accused   them  of  ingratitude.\n\nMoreover, during the confrontations, the managers  denied Mariano\n\nand  Bartosh access to the evidence against them, and in essence,\n\ndenied them  an opportunity  to defend themselves.   Accordingly,\n\nthe Board reasonably found the interrogations coercive.\n\nII.  Interfering with lawful Union activities\n\n          An employer lacks a  legitimate interest in interfering\n\nwith  union  activities  which  occur away  from  the  employer's\n\nproperty.  Threatening  to call  the police, in  the presence  of\n\nemployees, to  interfere with lawful union  activity violates the\n\nAct.  NLRB v.

In the  present  case, Company  security  officers\n\nthreatened to  have the  union organizers  arrested  in front  of\n\nMariano and  Bartosh, who  as unfair labor  practice dischargees,\n\ncontinued  to retain employee status under the Act, see 29 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n\n  152(3).   Accordingly, the  Board correctly concluded  that the\n\nthreat violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.\n\nIII.  Discharge\n\n          When an  employer discharges an employee for supporting\n\na union, he  violates the Act,  29 U.S.C    158(a)(3), unless  he\n\nproves that he would have taken the same action in the absence of\n\nthe employee's union activities.

Amber Delivery  Serv.,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391177\"><a href=\"/opinion/391177/national-labor-relations-board-v-amber-delivery-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1981).

American\n                                                                 \n\nSpring Bed Mfg. Co., 670 F.2d at 1245.\n                   \n\n          We conclude that substantial  evidence on the record as\n\na whole supports the Board's findings regarding the discharges of\n\nMariano and Bartosh.  The Company  admits that it  discharged the\n\nemployees for distributing union authorization cards.  It argues,\n\nhowever, that  by distributing  those cards, Mariano  and Bartosh\n\nwere soliciting,  and  that the  no-solicitation  rule  therefore\n\njustified the discharges.  \n\n          We  conclude,  as did  the  Board,  that the  Company's\n\nreliance on  the no-solicitation rule  was a  pretext to  justify\n\ndischarges for engaging  in union activity.   At the time of  the\n\ndischarges,  the Company knew  that Mariano and  Bartosh were the\n\nin-plant  leaders  of the  union's  organizational  effort.   The\n\nCompany then  coercively  interrogated them  and then  discharged\n\nthem based solely upon a cursory investigation, affording them no\n\n                               -7-\n\nopportunity to defend themselves.  Moreover,     the    Company's\n\nemployees  were generally  unaware of  the no-solicitation  rule,\n\nmuch  less its enforcement.  Indeed, Mariano and Bartosh were the\n\nonly  employees that  the  Company ever  disciplined for  alleged\n\nviolations of  the no-solicitation rule.   Accordingly, the Board\n\nreasonably determined that the  no-solicitation rule was merely a\n\npretextual justification for an illegal discharge.\n\n          In a  final  attempt to  salvage  the validity  of  the\n\ndischarges, the Company claimed  that Mariano and Bartosh engaged\n\nin time card irregularities.  However, the Company failed to even\n\nmention this  serious accusation  at the  time of  the employees'\n\ndischarges.   Thus, the Board  reasonably afforded  no credit  to\n\nthis argument.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          We have  considered all  other allegations made  by the\n\nCompany  and conclude that they lack merit.  The Board's judgment\n\nwas  rational and effectively promotes the  goals of the Act.  As\n\nsuch, we affirm the Board's order.\n\n          The  petition  for review  is  denied  and the  Board's\n                                               \n\nrequest for enforcement of its order is granted.\n                                               \n\n          Costs to the Board.\n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
