This is an appeal from an order of the\n                    \n\ndistrict court  refusing to terminate  appellant's commitment\n\nfor civil contempt.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          A grand jury  in the district of  Massachusetts has\n\nbeen  investigating  the  operation  of  an  alleged  illegal\n\ngambling racket.   Appellant  was one of  the targets  of the\n\ninvestigation.   He was  indicted in  February  1992 and,  in\n\nOctober 1992, he pleaded guilty.  Shortly before he was to be\n\nsentenced, appellant  was  subpoenaed to  appear  before  the\n\ngrand jury.  Appellant refused  to testify and, on January 8,\n\n1993, the  court granted  use immunity.   18 U.S.C.     6002,\n\n6003.   Upon his continued  refusal to answer  questions, the\n\ngovernment filed a petition for contempt.  The district court\n\nheld a  hearing on  January 22.   At the  hearing appellant's\n\nlawyer  stated that the reasons appellant refused to testify,\n\ndespite the grant  of immunity, were that he  was morally and\n\nethically  opposed to testifying  against anyone and  that he\n\nfeared for his  own safety and the safety of  his ex-wife and\n\nchildren.\n\n          Appellant did  not testify on his own  behalf.  His\n\nattorney  added  the  information   that  appellant  had  not\n\ncooperated during the two and a half years leading up to  his\n\nindictment,  despite   government  efforts   to  secure   his\n\ncooperation.  He also emphasized that the  government had not\n\n                             -2-\n\nsought  indictments  against  some  of  the  individuals  who\n\ndecided to  cooperate and, as  for others who  pleaded guilty\n\npursuant  to plea bargains,  the government  was recommending\n\nprobation.  In light of  this and the long sentence appellant\n\nwas  facing due  to  his non-cooperation,  he argued,  it was\n\nplain  that  18  months of  further  incarceration  would not\n\ncoerce appellant to testify.  The court, relying, in part, on\n\nthe fact that  appellant had not yet spent any  time in jail,\n\nheld him in contempt and ordered him incarcerated pursuant to\n\n28  U.S.C.     1826(a).    Four  days  later,  appellant  was\n\nsentenced to a term  of imprisonment of 78 months and  a term\n\nof supervised  release of  three  years.   This sentence  was\n\nstayed during the  term of his civil  contempt incarceration.\n\nAppellant did not pursue an appeal from the  initial contempt\n\norder.\n\n          He then  filed  a motion  to  vacate the  order  of\n\ncontempt  on September 23, 1993 -- approximately eight months\n\nafter he was held in  contempt.  The court denied  the motion\n\nwithout  a hearing and  without findings of  fact.  Appellant\n\nalso did not  pursue an appeal  from this denial.   A  second\n\nmotion to vacate the contempt  order was filed on January 20,\n\n1994 --  a year from the order of  contempt.  In this motion,\n\nappellant repeated the arguments made in the initial hearing.\n\nHe added that even after  being indicted, he had continued to\n\nrefuse to cooperate despite the  promise of some leniency  in\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe  government's  sentencing  recommendation.   Further,  he\n\nargued,  he had  spent 12  of the  maximum 18  months without\n\nchanging his mind.  Given the long criminal sentence he faces\n\nand  the now three and  a half years  of silence, he asserted\n\nthat there was  no chance he would ever testify.   Again, the\n\ncourt denied the  motion by endorsement, without  stating its\n\nreasons.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          Appellant only argues, on appeal, that the district\n\ncourt,  in denying his  motion to vacate  the contempt order,\n\nfailed to make the required individualized determination that\n\nthere  still  was  a  realistic  possibility  that  continued\n\nincarceration  would  likely  result in  compliance  with the\n\norder to testify.  Thus,  his only request is that we  remand\n\nthe case.\n\n          Appellant relies on  Simkin v.  United States,  715\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 34 (2d Cir.  1983).  Simkin acknowledged the  \"virtually\n                                \n\nunreviewable  discretion\"  a  district  court  judge  has  in\n\ndeciding whether a  civil commitment has lost  \"any realistic\n\npossibility of having a coercive effect.\"  Id. at 38.   Given\n                                              \n\nthe  speculative nature of  the decision, however,  the court\n\nheld that such deference is due \"only  if it appears that the\n\njudge  has assessed the likelihood of  a coercive effect upon\n\nthe  particular  contemnor\"  by   making  \"an  individualized\n\ndecision.\"   Id.   Appellant argues that  the record  here is\n                \n\n                             -4-\n\nambiguous and that  there is evidence that the  judge did not\n\nmake   an  \"individualized\"   determination  concerning   the\n\ncoercive  nature  of  his  incarceration.   Specifically,  he\n\npoints to a question by the judge, at the initial hearing, as\n\nto whether appellant understood \"the penalty\" for refusing to\n\ntestify.\n\n          We find appellant's argument  unpersuasive.  By the\n\ntime of  appellant's second motion,  the court had  before it\n\nthe transcript from the initial  hearing, appellant's current\n\naffidavit  stating that  he would  never  testify before  the\n\ngrand jury, and the memoranda filed by the parties.  The only\n\nnew \"evidence\" presented for the court's consideration is the\n\nlength of time -- one year -- that appellant now has spent in\n\njail  under the  contempt  order.   Because  this factor  was\n\ncentral   to  the  court's  initial  decision  to  order  the\n\nincarceration of appellant, we think that it is reasonable to\n\nassume  that  the   district  court,  in  deciding   to  deny\n\nappellant's  motion for release, in fact, considered the time\n\nappellant has served without testifying.\n\n          Unlike  Simkin, there is no evidence that the court\n                        \n\nhere considered any  factors other than the  continued impact\n                                       \n\nof   incarceration  on  appellant.    The  reference  to  the\n\n\"penalty\" for not testifying was made in the initial hearing.\n                                                    \n\nThe district court's  decision arising out of that hearing is\n\nnot before us.  To the extent that appellant is arguing for a\n\n                             -5-\n\nmechanical  rule requiring a  formal statement or  finding in\n\nevery case, we think  that this case -- in which the district\n\ncourt's view is  evident from context -- is  not the occasion\n\nto consider imposing such a requirement.  Apart from the lack\n\nof a  formal  finding,  appellant  has not  argued  that  the\n\ndistrict  court's action is subject to reversal (for example,\n\nas  clearly  erroneous  or  demonstrably  based  on  improper\n\nfactors).\n\n          Nothing we say  is intended to discourage  district\n\ncourts   from  explaining  their   actions  in  continuing  a\n\ndefendant's imprisonment for civil contempt.  The longer such\n\nincarceration continues  without effect,  the more  uncertain\n\nare  the prospects  that further  incarceration  will produce\n\ncompliance.    At  some  point  and  in  some  circumstances,\n\ncontinued  incarceration might be hard  to justify or, at the\n\nvery  least,  would  call  for  some  explanation.   But  the\n\ndistrict court has considerable latitude in  evaluating these\n\nprospective effects, In  re Grand Jury Proceeding  (Doe), No.\n                                                        \n\n93-2316, slip op. at 10-11 (1st  Cir., Jan. 10, 1994), and we\n\ncannot say here that it has exceeded permissible bounds.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -6-\n",

Specifically, he points to a question by the judge, at the initial hearing, as to whether appellant understood \"the penalty\" for refusing to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find appellant's argument unpersuasive.  By the time of appellant's second motion, the court had before it the transcript from the initial hearing, appellant's current affidavit stating that he would never testify before the grand jury, and the memoranda filed by the parties.  The only new \"evidence\" presented for the court's consideration is the length of time-one year-that appellant now has spent in jail under the contempt order.  Because this factor was central to the court's initial decision to order the incarceration of appellant, we think that it is reasonable to assume that the district court, in deciding to deny appellant's motion for release, in fact, considered the time appellant has served without testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Simkin, there is no evidence that the court here considered any factors other than the continued impact of incarceration on appellant.  The reference to the \"penalty\" for not testifying was made in the initial hearing.  The district court's decision arising out of that hearing is not before us.  To the extent that appellant is arguing for a mechanical rule requiring a formal statement or finding in every case, we think that this case-in which the district court's view is evident from context-is not the occasion to consider imposing such a requirement.  Apart from the lack of a formal finding, appellant has not argued that the district court's action is subject to reversal (for example, as clearly erroneous or demonstrably based on improper factors).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing we say is intended to discourage district courts from explaining their actions in continuing a defendant's imprisonment for civil contempt.  The longer such incarceration continues without effect, the more uncertain are the prospects that further incarceration will produce compliance.  At some point and in some circumstances, continued incarceration might be hard to justify or, at the very least, would call for some explanation.  But the district court has considerable latitude in evaluating these prospective effects, In re Grand Jury Proceeding (Doe), No. 93-2316, slip op. at 10-11 (1st Cir., Jan. 10, 1994), and we cannot say here that it has exceeded permissible bounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
