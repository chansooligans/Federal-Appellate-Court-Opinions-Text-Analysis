These appeals are from convictions\n                       \n\non assorted  charges of conspiracy, importing and possessing\n\nlarge  quantities  of  marijuana  and  cocaine,  aiding  and\n\nabetting  therein  and,  in  the  case  of  Medina  Vazquez,\n\npossession of a firearm in connection with the drug charges.\n\nThese defendants were tried together with two others.   This\n\ntrial  was part of the serial prosecution of some 55 members\n\nof   a  large   scale  drug  importation   and  distribution\n\norganization  known  as  \"La   Nena.\"    Of  their  numerous\n\nassertions of error, the most serious is the denial of their\n\nmotions for  a mistrial  after discovery by  the court  that\n\nfour of  the jurors had  arrived at a  conclusion concerning\n\nguilt prior to the presentation of the defendants' evidence.\n\nWe  reserve our  discussion  of this  difficult issue  until\n\nlast.\n\nl. Sufficiency of evidence.\n                          \n\n          All  defendants challenge  the sufficiency  of the\n\nevidence against them because the government's case depended\n\non    the   testimony    of   Geraldo    Portalatin   Toledo\n\n(\"Portalatin\"),  a  leading member  of  the  \"La Nena\"  drug\n\norganization.   Defendants argue that Portalatin's testimony\n\nwas so  unreliable and so  sketchy as  to them, that  it was\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ninsufficient  as  a matter  of law.   Portalatin  was cross-\n\nexamined  concerning his  deals  with the  government.   The\n\njudge gave  complete and correct instructions  detailing the\n\nspecial care the jury should take in assessing the testimony\n\nof an accomplice.   Under these circumstances, an accomplice\n\nis a qualified witness and the credibility of the witness is\n\nfor the jury.  United States v. Restrepo-Contreras, 942 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n96, 99  (1st Cir. 1991) (it  is the province of  the jury to\n\nassess the credibility of  a witness), cert. denied, 112  S.\n                                                   \n\nCt. 955 (1992).   Portalatin testified that Ortiz Arrigoitia\n\nand  Medina  Vazquez  helped  unload  various  shipments  of\n\nmarijuana and cocaine and  Ortiz Cameron participated in the\n\nunloading  and  distribution  of  a  load  of  cocaine  at a\n\n\"clandestine  airfield\" at  La  Furnia Farm  in Barceloneta,\n\nPuerto Rico.    Portalatin's  evidence,  if  believed,  when\n\nconsidered  with   the  other  evidence  in   the  case  was\n\nsufficient    to   support    conviction   by    the   jury,\n\nnotwithstanding  Portalatin's  unsavory   history  and   the\n\ncontrary evidence presented by the defendants.\n\n2.  Improper admission of testimony.\n                                   \n\n          Ortiz  Cameron  further   asserts  error  in   the\n\nadmission of evidence.  Portalatin testified that the driver\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nof  a Chevrolet \"power wagon\" (apparently a four-wheel-drive\n\ntruck) which was used  to remove the cargo of  cocaine after\n\nan  incoming plane crashed at   Furnia was  \"Hiram,\" whom he\n\nidentified  as  Luis  Hiram Ortiz  Cameron,  the  defendant.\n\nPortalatin had been  in the plane which  crashed, had bumped\n\nhis head,  had pulled  the pilot  out of  the plane and  had\n\ndescribed  himself as  \"shaken\"  by the  experience.   Ortiz\n\nCameron argues  that  Portalatin's  condition  made  him  so\n\nunreliable that his testimony  should not have been allowed.\n\nThere  is no  evidence,  however, that  he  was in  any  way\n\nincapacitated.   He  pulled the  pilot  from the  plane  and\n\nhelped  salvage the cargo.   He then spent  two hours beside\n\n\"Hiram\"  as  the  latter  drove  the  \"power  wagon\"  to the\n\ndestination of  the contraband.   Under such  circumstances,\n\nhis credibility was for the jury.\n\n          During  the  cross-examination of  Portalatin, the\n\ndefense  attorney   discovered  for  the  first   time  that\n\nPortalatin, during his debriefing  by government agents, was\n\nshown a picture of Ortiz Cameron.  He immediately identified\n\nthe picture, saying \"That's Hiram.\"  It does not appear that\n\nany  suggestive comment was made.  This picture was not part\n\nof a  spread, however, and it was shown to Portalatin in the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ncourse of the discussion of his participation in the various\n\ndrug transactions.\n\n          Defense counsel moved that  Portalatin's testimony\n\nconcerning  Ortiz  Cameron   be  stricken  as   unacceptably\n\ntainted.  Among other  reasons, he asserted that he  had not\n\nbeen shown the photograph in question, and that the evidence\n\npacket  furnished by  the  prosecution contained  copies  of\n\nphotographs which  were simply  blotches of white  on black.\n\nThe prosecutor replied that  all defendants had been invited\n\nto  the office of the United  States Attorney to view all of\n\nthe government's hundreds of exhibits, but that none of them\n\nhad taken  advantage of  the opportunity.   The  trial judge\n\nmade  no  explicit  finding,  but  apparently  accepted  the\n\nprosecution's explanation.  He offered to suspend the trial,\n\nhowever,  to  provide  defense  counsel  an  opportunity  to\n\nexamine the photo  and to develop  any evidence of  improper\n\nsuggestion.  Counsel declined  and proceeded with the cross-\n\nexamination of Portalatin.   Not until eight days later,  at\n\nthe close of all  the evidence, did counsel move  for a voir\n                                                            \n\ndire  of Portalatin  to explore  any  possible taint.   This\n    \n\nuntimely motion was denied.\n\n          The   reliability   of  identification   testimony\n\nallegedly tainted by reason  of an impermissibly  suggestive\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nphotograph should be resolved after consideration of all the\n\ncircumstances.   Manson v.  Brathwaite, 432 U.S.  98, 113-14\n                                      \n\n(1977); United States  v. Bouthot, 878 F.2d  1506, 1514 (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1989).  In  this case, it would appear  that Portalatin\n\nhad  spent over two hours  in the close  company of \"Hiram,\"\n\nalbeit at night and under difficult circumstances.   He knew\n\nHiram's first name before the photograph was identified.\n\n          The district judge's offer to suspend the trial to\n\npermit further investigation was refused.  The defendant was\n\ndoubtless entitled to a  voir dire examination of Portalatin\n                                  \n\nbefore proceeding with the cross-examination,  but certainly\n\nnot eight days  later.  There was no error  in the denial of\n\nhis untimely motion.   Similarly,  we find no  error in  the\n\ntrial judge's decision to permit Portalatin's identification\n\nto stand.  \n\n          Ortiz Cameron  also alleges error in the admission\n\nof testimony  concerning his  disappearance from  his normal\n\nwhereabouts immediately  after the  \"La Furnia\"  episode and\n\nconcerning his wealth,  which the government asserted  could\n\nonly be explained by his participation in illicit drug deals\n\nover  a period of time.  The defendant had ample opportunity\n\nto  rebut such  testimony.    It  is well  established  that\n\nunexplained flight  or a defendant's attempt  to conceal his\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nidentity  may  be relevant  evidence of  guilt.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.  Grandmont, 680  F.2d  867, 869  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1982).  Similarly, evidence  of the acquisition of otherwise\n\nunexplained  wealth  may   corroborate  other  evidence   of\n\nparticipation in lucrative crimes.   United States v. Ariza-\n                                                            \n\nIbarra,  605  F.2d  1216,  1224-25 (1st  Cir.  1979),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 454 U.S. 895 (1981). \n       \n\n3.  Severance.\n             \n\n          All  three defendants  moved  before  trial for  a\n\nseverance  on the  ground  that there  would be  prejudicial\n\n\"spill-over\"  of evidence  from one  to the  other.   Such a\n\nmotion  is addressed  to the sound  discretion of  the trial\n\njudge.  United  States v.  Natanel, 938 F.2d  302, 308  (1st\n                                  \n\nCir.  1991), cert.  denied,  112 S.  Ct. 986  (1992); United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Boylan,  898  F.2d 230,  246  (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied,  111  S.  Ct.  139  (1990).   Where  defendants  are\n      \n\nindicted in  a common conspiracy, there  necessarily will be\n\nevidence  relevant  to the  charges  against  more than  one\n\ndefendant, and properly so, since co-conspirators are liable\n\nfor all of the  criminal acts carried out in  furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.   United States v. Figueroa,  976 F.2d 1446,\n                                           \n\n1452 (1st Cir. 1992).  The district judge properly exercised\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nhis discretionary  power in denying the  motion and properly\n\ninstructed the  jury to  consider the evidence  against each\n\ndefendant separately.\n\n          Defendants  Ortiz  Arrigoitia  and Medina  Vazquez\n\nrenewed  their  motion  after  the defendant  Ortiz  Cameron\n\ncalled Rafael  Tormes, a convicted  member of the  same drug\n\nconspiracy, as a  witness.  On  the stand, Tormes  testified\n\nthat  Ortiz Cameron  had nothing  to do  with the  La Furnia\n\nunloading.    He  did  not  in  any  way  incriminate  Ortiz\n\nArrigoitia or  Medina Vazquez.  No  inconsistent defense was\n\npresented.  All that  occurred was that on cross-examination\n\nTormes  corroborated  some of  the  details  of Portalatin's\n\ntestimony.   The prejudice  claimed by Ortiz  Arrigoitia and\n\nMedina  Vazquez is  that by  so doing  Tormes bolstered  the\n\ncredibility   of  Portalatin   to  their  detriment.     The\n\ndefendants  have  offered no  authority  in  support of  the\n\ndubious proposition  that this entitles them  to a mistrial,\n\nand we have found none.   See United States v. Angiulo,  897\n                                                      \n\nF.2d    1169,   1194-95    (1st    Cir.    1990)    (finding\n\nwithdrawal/noninvolvement       defense       insufficiently\n\nantagonistic to require severance); United States v. Luciano\n                                                            \n\nPacheco, 794  F.2d 7, 8-10 (1st Cir.  1986) (explaining that\n       \n\nthe degree of antagonism must go beyond mere finger pointing\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\ninto  the realm  of fundamental  disagreement over  core and\n\nbasic facts); United  States v. Talavera, 668 F.2d  625, 630\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir.) (concluding that antagonistic defenses do not per\n\nse require severance, even if the defendants are hostile  or\n\nattempt to cast blame on each other), cert. denied, 456 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n978  (1982).    The   district  judge  properly  denied  the\n\ndefendants' motions for severance and a mistrial.\n\n4.  Improper Argument.\n                     \n\n          In  the  course  of   his  closing  argument,  the\n\nprosecutor  said with  reference to  the defense  attorneys,\n\n\"they want like to scramble your heads, confuse you.\"  After\n\nan  objection was overruled,  the prosecutor  repeated \"They\n\nwanted to  confuse your head.\"   Later the  prosecutor said,\n\n\"Do not  let the attorneys  here intimidate you,  ladies and\n\ngentlemen  --  .\"1    Defense  counsel objected.   The judge\n\nresponded by addressing the jury: \"I don't  believe that the\n\nattorneys for the defendants  are intimidating the jurors so\n\n--.\"\n\n          In  this particular instance  we are not persuaded\n\nthat  these  comments  were  so prejudicial  as  to  require\n\n                    \n\n1This  quotation  and  the  following  one  were  unfinished\nsentences  according  the  transcript and  are  not ellipses\ncreated by the author of this opinion.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nreversal.    We  do  not  understand,  however,  why,  after\n\nnumerous warnings from this court, the prosecuting attorneys\n\nin  the District  of Puerto  Rico persist  in spiking  their\n\narguments  with comments that put their cases at risk.

Sentencing errors.\n                    \n\n          Medina  Vazquez  argues  that  the  district judge\n\nerroneously  refused to  reduce  his offense  level by  four\n\nbecause  of his  minimal participation.   U.S.S.G.    3B1.2.\n\nThe comment (n. 2)  to the cited section suggests  that this\n\nreduction should  be used sparingly,  e.g., in a  case where\n\nthe  defendant was engaged in a single off-loading.  In this\n\ncase  there was  credible evidence  that Medina  Vazquez had\n\nbeen involved in a  number of off-loadings.  In  the absence\n\nof any transcript of  the sentencing hearings in  either the\n\nrecord or the supplementary record, we shall assume that the\n\ndistrict  judge made  appropriate  findings of  fact.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Valedon Martinez v.  Hospital Presbiteriano, 806 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1128, 1135 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"We have held repeatedly that we\n\nwill not review a claim of error if the appellant has failed\n\nto include a  transcript of the pertinent proceedings in the\n\nrecord on appeal.\").\n\n          Ortiz  Cameron  argues  that  the  district  judge\n\nfailed  to make  sufficiently detailed  findings of  fact in\n\nresolving  factual  disputes  raised  by  objections to  the\n\npresentence investigation  report (\"psi\").   In fact,  those\n\nobjections to the psi present in our record on appeal raised\n\nno substantial  factual issues, except that  of guilt, which\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nhad already been resolved by the jury.  The district judge's\n\nfindings were more than adequate under the circumstances.\n\n6. Ineffective assistance of counsel.\n                                    \n\n          Ortiz  Cameron  alleges ineffective  assistance of\n\ntrial  counsel.    We  have  repeatedly  held  that,  absent\n\nexceptional circumstances, this claim  is not open on direct\n\nappeal  unless  it has  been  previously  raised before  the\n\ndistrict  judge,  who is  in the  best  position to  make an\n\ninitial judgment.   See, e.g.,  United States  v. Gray,  958\n                                                      \n\nF.2d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1992).  This issue was not presented to\n\nthe district  judge, who in  fact praised trial  counsel for\n\nhis diligence at one point in the trial.\n\n7. Recusal.\n          \n\n          After  the  trial in  this  case  the trial  judge\n\nrecused himself  from the trial of  Sonia Berrios Rodriguez,\n\n\"La  Nena,\"  the purported  head of  the  drug ring,  on the\n\ngrounds  of  his  familiarity with  the  facts  of the  case\n\nbecause of previous  related trials, of which this  was one.\n\nOrtiz  Cameron claims  that this  shows that  the judge  was\n\nprejudiced and should have recused himself earlier.  In fact\n\nthe judge was under no obligation to recuse himself from the\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\ntrial of  \"La Nena,\" but did  so as a matter  of discretion.\n\nIn re Allied-Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                        \n\nDefendant's argument is frivolous.\n\n8.  Motion for Mistrial Resulting from Jury Misconduct.\n                                                      \n\n          The  major controversy in  this case swirls around\n\nevents stemming from allegations of juror misconduct.  There\n\nare two issues that  arise in this context.   First, we must\n\ndecide whether  the district court's finding regarding juror\n\nimpartiality was clearly erroneous.   Second, we must decide\n\nwhether  a   remark  made   by  the  district   court  while\n\ninvestigating the question  of juror impartiality improperly\n\nshifted  the burden of proof.  While these two questions are\n\nfactually intertwined  in this case,  they are  analytically\n\ndistinct, and we therefore consider them seriatim.\n                                                 \n\n                      A.  Background.\n                                     \n\n          At the  close of the government's  case, the judge\n\nwas advised that the daughter of a juror, who had been daily\n\naccompanying her mother  to the court, had been  observed in\n\nprolonged conversation with a  young woman identified as the\n\ngirl friend of  the defendant Ortiz  Cameron.  The  district\n\njudge  then interviewed  the  daughter and  her mother,  the\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\njuror.  It appeared from these interviews that the juror had\n\ndiscussed  the case  at length  with  her daughter,  and had\n\nexpressed  very definite  views about  the testimony  of the\n\ngovernment's  witnesses.   The  daughter  also reported  her\n\nunderstanding from  talking with her mother  that the jurors\n\nhad discussed the case among themselves.  The juror was then\n\nsegregated from the other jurors and later excused.  \n\n          The  judge then  summoned all  of the  jurors into\n\nchambers, one by one, and asked them the following series of\n\nquestions:\n\n          l.   At this  point, have you  discussed with  the\n          jurors or  anyone else  the guilt or  innocence of\n          the defendants?\n\n          2.   Have you  discussed with  the other\n          jurors or with  anyone the reputation of\n          the defendants?\n\n          3.   Have  you discussed with  the other\n          jurors   or   with   anyone   else   the\n          credibility of any of the witnesses?\n\n          4.   At this  point, have you  reached a\n          decision   regarding    the   guilt   or\n          innocence of the defendants?\n\nAll  of  the  jurors except  one  answered  the first  three\nquestions in the negative.   One juror said that  he thought\n\nhe  had  heard some  comment about  the  case but  could not\n\nremember what it was about.  Four  jurors, however, answered\n\nthe fourth question in the affirmative, indicating that they\n\nhad reached a decision concerning the  guilt or innocence of\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nthe defendants.  The judge then  recalled these four jurors,\n\nagain one at a time, and addressed each one as follows: \n\n          As I instructed you before, the guilt or\n          innocence of the  defendants is  decided\n          after  listening to all the evidence, to\n          the  final  summations of  the attorneys\n          and after applying  the instructions  as\n          to the law to be given by me.\n\n          And my question is, would you be able to\n          keep an  open mind and in  the course of\n          your  deliberations   with  your  fellow\n          jurors,  re-examine  your own  views and\n          change your opinion  if convinced it  is\n          erroneous?\n\nAll  four  of  the   jurors  answered  emphatically  in  the\n\naffirmative.  The  district judge then declared that  he was\n\nsatisfied  that  the  jurors  would  carry  out  their  duty\n\nproperly,  based on  their  answers and  his observation  of\n\ntheir demeanor.\n\n          Counsel for Ortiz  Cameron and counsel  for Medina\n\nVazquez (and  counsel for another defendant  whose appeal is\n\nnot  before us)  moved for  a mistrial.   Counsel  for Ortiz\n\nArrigoitia expressly  declined to so  move at that  time and\n\njoined in the motion only at the very end of  the case, just\n\nbefore  closing  arguments.    In response  to  the  judge's\n\ncomment, counsel  for Ortiz Arrigoitia admitted  that he had\n\ninitially refrained from joining  the motion for the purpose\n\nof claiming double  jeopardy if the motion  had been granted\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nwithout his consent.   It is  our view that  a motion for  a\n\nmistrial  should  be made  promptly.   This  was no  case of\n\nmistake  or inadvertence,  but one  of deliberate  delay for\n\ntactical purposes.   Failure  to  make a  timely motion  for\n\nmistrial under these circumstances constitutes  a waiver and\n\nprecludes consideration of this issue on appeal with respect\n\nto Ortiz  Arrigoitia.   Cf. United  States v. DiPietro,  936\n                                                      \n\nF.2d  6,  9-10  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (inferring  waiver  of  a\n\ndefendant's   constitutional   protection   against   double\n\njeopardy   from  silence   where  the   defendant  had   the\n\nopportunity  to object  but failed  to do  so until  one day\n\nlater); Grimaldi  v.

District Court's Finding.\n                                            \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n          When a  non-frivolous suggestion  is  made that  a\n\njury may be biased or tainted by some incident, the district\n\ncourt  must  undertake  an  adequate  inquiry  to  determine\n\nwhether the alleged incident occurred and if so, whether  it\n\nwas prejudicial.  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258; United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.

The  trial judge  is not,\n\nhowever, shackled  to a rigid  and unyielding set  rules and\n\nprocedures  that  compel any  particular  form  or scope  of\n\ninquiry.    Rather, in  light  of  the  infinite variety  of\n\nsituations in which juror  misconduct might be discerned and\n\nthe need to protect  jurors and the jury process  from undue\n\nimposition, the trial judge is vested with the discretion to\n\nfashion   an  appropriate   and  responsible   procedure  to\n\ndetermine whether misconduct  actually occurred and  whether\n\nit was  prejudicial.  Boylan, 898  F.2d at 258.   As we have\n                            \n\noften  explained, \"A  district court  has broad,  though not\n\nunlimited, discretion to determine  the extent and nature of\n\nits  inquiry into allegations  of juror bias.\"   Corbin, 590\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 400.\n\n          In this  case, upon  discovering that a  juror may\n\nhave  spoken  about  the  trial  to  her  eighteen  year-old\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\ndaughter,  the district court immediately summoned the juror\n\nand  the daughter to chambers for separate interviews in the\n\npresence of all counsel.   The juror confirmed that  she had\n\nspoken to her daughter about the defendants, but denied that\n\nshe had  talked to  the other jurors  about the  case.   The\n\ndistrict  court promptly segregated  the juror and announced\n\nhis  intention  to  interview  individually  all  jurors  to\n\ndetermine  if any others  had been  tainted.   The following\n\nmorning  all  jurors  denied  speaking  about  the  case  to\n\noutsiders or each  other, though  one thought  he had  heard\n\nsome  comment  among  the  jurors  about  the  case  without\n\nidentifying  what  those comments  concerned.   Counsel were\n\npresent but  were not  permitted to participate  directly in\n\nthe interviews; however, the questions posed by the judge to\n\nthe  jurors  reflected   concerns  previously  expressed  by\n\ncounsel.  Counsel has no right to pose specific questions to\n\na  juror or to pursue every desired  avenue of inquiry.  The\n\ncontrol and direction of  a court's investigation into juror\n\nmisconduct is  within the discretion of  the district court,\n\nnot defense counsel.  Corbin, 590 F.2d at 400.\n                            \n\n          After  interviewing all  the  jurors and  relevant\n\nthird parties,  consulting with  counsel,  and weighing  the\n\ntestimony, demeanor, and credibility of the various parties,\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nthe  court found  the jurors  were not  partial.   The trial\n\ncourt conducted an adequate  investigation into the  alleged\n\nmisconduct  and reached  a reasonable  conclusion about  the\n\njurors'  impartiality.   Ortiz  Cameron  and Medina  Vazquez\n\npresent no compelling  evidence to the contrary  and we find\n\nnothing  in the  record that  leads us  to believe  that the\n\ndistrict  court's  investigation   was  inadequate  or   his\n\nfindings clearly erroneous.2\n\n                    C. Remark By Judge.\n                                       \n\n          It  is  also  suggested that  the  district  court\n\nshifted the burden of  proof when it asked the  four jurors:\n\n\"would you be able to keep an open mind and in the course of\n\nyour deliberations  with your fellow  jurors, reexamine your\n\nown  views  and  change  your  opinion  if  convinced it  is\n\nerroneous?\"  Although recognizing that the judge's remark is\n\n                    \n\n2Our  dissenting colleague  suggests an  \"alternative ground\nfor  reversal\" --  the district  court's failure  to inquire\ninto  Juror  Carrero-Roman's statement  that members  of the\njury  had  discussed  the  case.    See  Stahl,  n.9.    The\n                                       \ndefendants, however, have not specifically argued this issue\non appeal.  In any event, we do not consider the alternative\nground to be meritorious.   Juror Carrero-Roman's answer was\nextremely indefinite and, on the facts of this case, did not\nrequire  a  full-fledged judicial  inquiry.   Moreover,  the\njudge essentially conducted  a full-fledged inquiry when  he\nasked the  other jurors questions which  would have revealed\nprecisely the impropriety which Judge Stahl fears.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nless  than a  textbook model,  we do  not view  the language\n\nemployed,  in   the  specific  context  of   this  case,  as\n\nsuggesting that  the defendants  bore the burden  of proving\n\ntheir innocence.\n\n          First, the judge's  remark was not an  instruction\n\nat  all but a question asked mid-trial  in the context of an\n\ninvestigation we have  otherwise held to be sufficient.  See\n                                                            \n\nsupra  Part  A.   Second, the  question  -- even  if somehow\n     \n\ndeemed to be  an instruction -- did not place  the burden of\n\nproof on any  specific party  but merely  asked whether  the\n\njurors  retained the  ability  to reexamine  their views  in\n\nlight   of   further  developments.     Indeed,   the  judge\n\nscrupulously  avoided  indicating what  particular  views he\n\nthought the  jurors possessed and instead  referred only the\n\njurors' ability to change their \"opinion,\" whatever it might\n\nbe.   Third,  again assuming  that the  question were  to be\n\ndeemed  an  instruction, the  defendants  did  not give  the\n\ndistrict court an opportunity  to cure it by, at  any stage,\n\nproposing a sound alternative instruction.\n\n          And,  finally,  assuming  the  question   were  an\n\ninstruction,  it must be viewed in the context of the entire\n\njury charge.  See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 244; see  also Cupp v.\n                                                            \n\nNaughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973) (\"a single instruction\n        \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nto  a  jury may  not  be judged  in  artificial isolation\").\n\nHere, in  his pre-deliberations  charge, the judge  at least\n\nten times  explicitly and directly instructed  the jury that\n\nthe  government bore  the burden of  proof.3   Moreover, the\n\njudge himself placed his previous questioning of the jury in\n\ncontext when he stated:\n\n          Except for my instructions to you on the\n          law, you should disregard anything I may\n          have  said during the  trial in arriving\n          at your own findings as to the facts.\n\nAny slight  ambiguity created by the  mid-trial reference to\n\nan  \"open  mind,\" then,  is  adequately  dispelled once  the\n\n                    \n\n3To provide just two examples, the judge stated:\n\n               Indeed the  defendants are presumed\n          by law to be innocent.  The law does not\n          require  the  defendant  to   prove  his\n          innocence or produce any evidence at all\n          and no inference whatsoever may be drawn\n          from the election of a defendant  not to\n          testify.\n\n               The   government,   that   is   the\n          prosecution[,]   has   the   burden   of\n          providing  or  proving the[  defendants]\n          guilty beyond a  reasonable doubt and if\n          he fails to do so, you must acquit them.\n\nLater, the judge repeated  that \"it is up to  the government\nto prove the[ defendants] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nElsewhere in the charge the judge continually instructed the\njury that the government  bore the burden of proof  beyond a\nreasonable  doubt  with  regard  to  each  element  of  each\noffense.\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\n\"instruction\" is viewed in the context of these other, ample\n\ninstructions.4\n\n          We find  further support  for our conclusion  in a\n\nfifth  factor --  circuit precedent.   See United  States v.\n                                                            \n\nNickens, 955 F.2d 112,  118-19 (1st Cir. 1992).   In Nickens\n                                                            \n\nthe district judge, in his opening charge to the jury and in\n                                                         \n\nremarks made  to the jury after  closing arguments, actually\n\nissued an \"open mind\" instruction  very similar to the  mid-\n                                 \n\ntrial question  asked here.  In finding that the instruction\n\nwas  not plain error, we held  that it \"merely told the jury\n\nnot to evaluate the  evidence it would be hearing  until the\n\nevidence  was  all  in  and   the  court  had  rendered  its\n\ninstructions.\"  Id. at 118.  We further noted that:\n                   \n\n          Telling  a  jury  to  postpone  making a\n          final  judgment  until all  the evidence\n          has  been  presented, does  not instruct\n          the jury as to the weight or effect that\n          should be  given to  any aspect of  that\n          evidence  -- nor  to the  presumption of\n          innocence  --  when  making their  final\n          judgment.\n\nId. at 119.  Given this precedent, and given the  four case-\n   \n\nspecific  factors  we  have  identified, we  find  that  the\n\n                    \n\n4We note,  however, that this entire  situation could easily\nhave been  avoided had the  judge instructed the  jurors, at\nthe  time this issue arose,  that the burden  of proving the\ndefendants' guilt always rests with the government.\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nremarks  made by  the district  judge did  not impermissibly\n\nshift the burden of proof.5\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n5The judge below also made a mid-trial \"open mind\" statement\nwhich  is more easily construed as an \"instruction.\"  As the\ndissent   acknowledges,  however,  no  one  challenged  this\nstatement at any  stage.  If we were to  review it, then, it\nwould  be  under a  plain  error  rubric and  Nickens  would\n                                                     \ndirectly control.\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n         STAHL,  Circuit Judge, (Dissenting).  With respect,\n         STAHL,  Circuit Judge, (Dissenting).\n                              \n\nI  dissent from the  majority opinion because  I believe that\n\nthe  district  court's  response  to  the  juror   misconduct\n\nallegations in this case obliges us to grant defendants a new\n\ntrial.  With  regard to  this issue, the  majority rests  its\n\naffirmance on the well-established  rule that district courts\n\nhave discretion  \"to fashion  an appropriate  and responsible\n\nprocedure  to determine  whether [juror]  misconduct actually\n\noccurred  and  whether  it was  prejudicial.\"    Ante,  at 15\n                                                    \n\n(citing Boylan,  898 F.2d  at 258).    While I  agree that  a\n             \n\ndistrict court  has broad discretion to  determine the nature\n                                                            \n\nof its inquiry into allegations of juror misconduct, I do not\n\nthink that that discretion is  so broad as to permit  a court\n\nto commit errors of constitutional dimension while performing\n\nthat inquiry.\n\n         Here, the  district court, in its  effort to assess\n\nwhether juror  misconduct had occurred, selected  a method of\n\ninquiry  which had the effect, in my opinion, of shifting the\n\nburden  of  proof  from  the government  to  the  defendants.\n\nMoreover, the court's failure properly to instruct the jurors\n\nof the government's burden of proof compounded the error.  As\n\na result, I  am of the opinion that the  motions for mistrial\n\nshould  have  been  granted.   For  these  reasons,  I  would\n\nreverse.\n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\n         This case, in my  view, cannot properly be resolved\n\nwithout  a detailed  summary  of the  events surrounding  the\n\ncourt's  response to  the  juror misconduct  allegations.   I\n\nbegin therefore with a recitation of these facts.  \n\n         When  the  question  of  possible  juror misconduct\n\narose, the district judge immediately and correctly commenced\n\nan  interrogation of  a young  woman, the  daughter  of Juror\n\nGonzales,  who had  been seen  conversing with  a defendant's\n\ngirlfriend.   During the inquiry,  it became apparent  to the\n\ncourt that  the daughter  and the defendant's  girlfriend had\n\ndiscussed that  defendant's innocence.  It  also became clear\n\nthat the daughter had discussed many aspects of the case with\n\nher  mother, Juror  Gonzales.   As a  result, the  court then\n\ninterrogated Ms. Gonzales.  \n\n         Juror  Gonzales  admitted that  she had  engaged in\n\ndiscussions with her  daughter about the  case.  She  denied,\n\nhowever, having  expressed  any opinion  as to  the guilt  or\n\ninnocence of  the defendants,  and  generally downplayed  the\n\nextent  and content of the discussions.  She also stated that\n\nno  juror had  indicated  an  opinion  as  to  the  guilt  or\n\ninnocence of the defendants.  \n\n         At    the    conclusion    of   Juror    Gonzales's\n\ninterrogation,  counsel  for  defendant  Diaz  Fernandez  and\n\ncounsel for defendant Ortiz Cameron moved for a mistrial.  In\n\nresponse, the court first indicated that it did not intend to\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\nquestion  any  of  the other  jurors.    The AUSA  requested,\n\nhowever,  that the court reconsider that decision.  The court\n\nthen indicated that it  would take no action on  the mistrial\n\nmotions  that  evening  but  would  decide  what  to  do  the\n\nfollowing  morning.    Ortiz  Cameron's  attorney  then,  for\n\nunexplained reasons, retracted his motion for mistrial.\n\n         The   following   morning,   the  court   commenced\n\ninterrogations  of  each  of  the  remaining  twelve  jurors,\n\nbeginning with the jury foreman.  Counsel took no part in the\n\nformulation of the following four questions: \n\n         (1) At this point have you discussed with\n         the other jurors or with  anyone else the\n         guilt  or  innocence  of the  defendants?\n         (2) Have  you  discussed with  the  other\n         jurors or with  anyone the reputation  of\n         the defendants?   (3) Have  you discussed\n         with the other jurors or with anyone else\n         the credibility of the defendants? (4) At\n                                            (4) At\n         this  point have  you reached  a decision\n         regarding  the guilt or  innocence of the\n         defendants?  \n         defendants?\n\n         The foreman and eight  of the other jurors answered\n\n\"no\" to all four  questions.  One  of those jurors, Mr.  Luis\n\nCarrero  Roman,  however,  answered question  three  with the\n\nstatement: \"Well,  I can say it is hard  for me to say yes or\n\nno  because yes, we made comments between us but nothing that\n\nI  can  say  yes or  no.\"    Four  other jurors  (hereinafter\n\nreferred   to  collectively  as   \"the  four  jurors\")  while\n\nanswering \"no\"  to the first three  questions, answered \"yes\"\n\nto the critical fourth question.  \n\n                            -27-\n                             27\n\n         At this juncture,  the Court individually  recalled\n\nthe four  jurors.  The court  then asked the  four jurors one\n\nquestion,  a question  which,  in my  opinion, was  seriously\n\nleading.   Before asking  the  question, the  court made  the\n\nfollowing statement:  \n\n         As I instructed you  before, the guilt or\n         innocence  of  the defendants  is decided\n         after listening to  all the evidence,  to\n         the final summations of the attorneys and\n         after applying the instructions as to the\n         law to be given by me.\n\nThe court followed this statement with:  \n\n         And my question is,  would you be able to\n         keep an  open mind  and in the  course of\n         your   deliberations  with   your  fellow\n         jurors,  re-examine  your  own views  and\n         change  your opinion  if convinced  it is\n         erroneous?\n\nEach  of  the  four  jurors answered  this  question  in  the\n\naffirmative.    Juror Luis  Carrero  Roman,  who admitted  to\n\nhaving  engaged in  discussions  with other  jurors, was  not\n\nrecalled.  At no time did the court allow counsel to speak or\n\nto propose  follow-up  questions.    Indeed,  throughout  the\n                                                       \n\ninquiry, the court refused to allow  defense counsel to utter\n\nso much as a word.\n\n         After  the   inquiry  ended,  however,   the  court\n\nentertained objections.  Counsel for  Diaz Fernandez objected\n\nboth  to the  length of  the court's  interrogations and  the\n\nleading  nature of the revised question.  He also pointed out\n\nthat some jurors  had stated that they either had discussions\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\nwith one another or had already made up their minds.  Counsel\n\nthen  renewed his motion for a mistrial, stressing his belief\n\nthat  no instruction  could cure  the problem.   Counsel  for\n       \n\ndefendant Ortiz Cameron then  joined the motion for mistrial,\n\narguing   that  the   presumption  of   innocence   had  been\n\ncompromised.   Counsel for defendant Ortiz  Arrigoitia, while\n\nobjecting to the court's juror questions, nonetheless did not\n\njoin the motion for mistrial. \n\n         At that point, the AUSA also expressed concern with\n\nthe court's inquiry: \n\n         [O]ne  thing  concerns me,  and  it is  a\n         point  brought  up  by [defense  counsel]\n         concerning  the  instructions  that  have\n         been given by the Court to the petit jury\n         to the  effect that  they should  keep an\n         open  mind at  all  times until  the end.\n         And  apparently  these  four  jurors,  at\n         least, have not  kept an open  mind until\n         the end of the proceedings.\n\nAs a result  of these concerns, the  AUSA urged the  court to\n\nenter specific  findings  as to  the \"demeanor\"  of the  four\n\njurors:  \n\n         . . . I  would ask that the  court make[]\n         findings  to the  effect  that [the  four\n         jurors] appear[ed] to be quite  sincere .\n         .  . .  The bottom  line is,  Your Honor,\n         this  is  a  due process  issue,  whether\n         these defendants are  being afforded  due\n         process  by these  jurors,  and  to  that\n         effect, I believe the Court would have to\n         enter a finding that yes, they  can, they\n         are willing and able to keep an open mind\n         and to reach a decision at the end of the\n         case  based  upon  the  evidence  and the\n         instructions  given by the court. I would\n         think  it is  a close  shot, but  I think\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\n         there is  sufficient information received\n         by the  Court through the  questioning to\n         make a decision.   \n\n         Immediately  thereafter,  the  court   entered  the\n\nfollowing statement for the record: \n\n         All right.  This  is a matter of deciding\n         whether these jurors, especially the four\n         jurors  that  we  have   questioned,  are\n         sincere and will be willing to give these\n         defendants   all  due  process.    And  I\n         believe[,]  and I  so find[,]  that these\n         jurors are sincere  and in  the same  way\n         they  expressed an opinion that they have\n         reached  a decision as  of now, they also\n         sincerely are  able to keep an  open mind\n         and re-examine their own views .  . . . I\n         was  impressed by  the  sincerity of  the\n         answers  and the expressions  in the face\n         of  each  juror when  I asked  the second\n         part of the last question . . . .\n\nThe  court  then denied  the  pending  motions for  mistrial.\n\nSubsequently, counsel  for defendant Pedro Rivera  joined the\n\nmotions for mistrial. \n\n         The  court then decided  to excuse  Juror Gonzales,\n\nwhose discussions  with her daughter had  inspired the entire\n\ninquiry, a decision approved  by all counsel.  When  the jury\n\nreconvened, the court instructed it as follows:\n\n         So, I  again  repeat my  instructions  to\n         you, not  to form or  express an  opinion\n         regarding the  guilt or innocence  of the\n         defendant, to keep  an open mind.   Don't\n         discuss the case among yourselves or with\n         anyone else.  Keep an open mind.   \n\nNo one objected to this instruction. \n\n         The   court's  final   instructions  to   the  jury\n\ncontained the following:\n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\n         The indictment or  formal charge  against\n         the defendant  is not evidence  of guilt.\n         Indeed the defendants are presumed by law\n         to be innocent.  The law does not require\n         the defendant  to prove his  innocence or\n         produce  any  evidence  at  all   and  no\n         inference  whatsoever  may be  drawn from\n         the  election  of  the defendant  not  to\n         testify. \n\n         Under the law a  defendant may or may not\n         testify as  he elects  since it is  up to\n         the  government  to  prove   them  guilty\n         beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  as  I  said\n         before.  The  law  does  not  require the\n         defendant to take  the witness stand  and\n         testify and  no presumption of  guilt may\n         be raised  and no  inference of  any kind\n         may  be drawn from defendant's failure to\n         testify.\n\n         In   addition,   the  court   gave   several  other\n\n\"reasonable  doubt\" instructions  in connection  with various\n\naspects  of  the  case.     At  no  time,  however,   did  it\n\nunequivocally instruct that the burden of proof was always on\n            \n\nthe government.6  \n\n                   \n\n6.  In its initial  charge to the jury,  the court instructed\non the government's burden as follows:\n\n         The indictment or  formal charge  against\n         the  defendant is not  evidence of guilt.\n         Indeed the     defendants are presumed by\n         law  to be  innocent.   The law  does not\n         require  the  defendant   to  prove   his\n         innocence  or produce any evidence at all\n         and no inference  whatsoever may be drawn\n         from the  election of a defendant  not to\n         testify. \n\n         The government, that  is the  prosecution\n         has  the burden  of providing  or proving\n         them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and\n         if  he (sic)  fails  to do  so, you  must\n         acquit them. Thus, while the government's\n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\n         The  majority concludes  that  the  district  court\n\nreached a reasonable conclusion about the impartiality of the\n\njurors and that defendants  Ortiz Cameron and Medina Vazquez:\n\n         present  no  compelling  evidence to  the\n         contrary  and  we  find  nothing  in  the\n         record that  leads us to believe that the\n         district   court's   investigation    was\n         inadequate   or   his  findings   clearly\n         erroneous.\n\nAnte, at 16.   Respectfully,  my review of  that same  record\n   \n\nleads me to the opposite conclusion. \n\n         When faced with four  jurors who admitted that they\n\nhad formed an  opinion about  the guilt or  innocence of  the\n\ndefendants, the district court brought these four jurors into\n\nchambers  again and, in  my view, structured  the \"open mind\"\n\nquestion in such  a way  that \"yes\" was  the only  acceptable\n                                                \n\nresponse.  Before asking  the question, the court effectively\n\nadmonished the four jurors, reminding them of its instruction\n\nat the beginning of the trial to determine guilt or innocence\n\nonly after hearing all of the evidence.  One does  not need a\n\ndegree  in  psychology to  understand  the  effect that  this\n\nstatement  had on  the  four jurors'  ability to  answer this\n\ncritical \"question\" in a calm and uninhibited manner.  \n\n         At pages 17-19 of the majority opinion, my brethren\n\noffer  five  reasons  why this  question  did  not,  in their\n\n                   \n\n         burden of  proof  is a  strict  or  heavy\n         burden,  it  is  not necessary  that  the\n         defendant's  guilt  be proved  beyond all\n         doubt. \n\n                            -32-\n                             32\n\nestimation,  shift the burden of proof.   I do not think that\n\nany  one  of  these  five  points  sufficiently  answers  the\n\nproblem.   With the first  four points,  I am afraid  that my\n\ncolleagues have ceded analysis to semantics, and have exalted\n\nform  over substance.   I  cannot join  in such  an approach,\n\nparticularly where, as here, the fundamental right to  a fair\n\ntrial is at stake.\n\n         As  to  the  majority's  fifth point  -  i.e.,  its\n                                                      \n\nreliance  upon   Nickens,  955   F.2d  at  118-19,   for  the\n                       \n\nproposition that  the judge's \"open  mind\" instruction  cured\n\nany such shifting of the burden of  proof - I am baffled.  In\n\nNickens, we  upheld almost identical \"open mind\" instructions\n      \n\nonly after acknowledging that they were problematic.  See id.\n                                                            \n\nat 118  (affirming  instructions \"[w]ithout  endorsing  their\n\nform\").   We were  analyzing those instructions  to determine\n\nwhether they alone had the effect of negating the presumption\n                 \n\nof  innocence.   We reasoned  that those  instructions \"would\n\n[not]  normally suggest  to  the jury  that the  government's\n              \n\nburden of proving  guilt is  equal to  defendant's burden  of\n\nproving  innocence.\"    Id.  (emphasis  supplied).    Finding\n                          \n\nnothing  extraordinary in  that case,  we concluded  that the\n\ninstructions were  not \"so  egregious as to  constitute plain\n\nerror.\"  Id.\n           \n\n         Here,  however, we  are  not reviewing  this  \"open\n\nmind\"  instruction  to determine  whether  it  alone had  the\n\n                            -33-\n                             33\n\neffect of negating the presumption of  innocence.  Rather, we\n\nmust determine whether this otherwise problematic instruction\n\ncured the multi-layered burden of proof problems presented by\n    \n\nthis case.  I  think it obvious that this  instruction cannot\n\nand  should  not  be  viewed  as  curative.7    As  such,  my\n\ncolleagues'  reference  to  Nickens as  controlling  \"circuit\n                                  \n\nprecedent\" is entirely unpersuasive.\n\n         In  sum,  it  is  my strong  opinion  that  when he\n\nreconvened  the jury,  the trial  judge had an  obligation to\n\ncure any potential misperceptions  his colloquy may have left\n                                     \n\nin the minds of  the four jurors on the  fundamental question\n\nof who bears the burden of proof.  Waiting until the very end\n\nof  a lengthy  trial to  instruct the  jury properly  on this\n\nquestion  does  not  alleviate  the prejudice.8    Under  any\n                                                         any\n                                                            \n\nstandard  of  review, I  think  these  convictions should  be\n\nreversed and that defendants should be granted a new and fair\n\n                   \n\n7.  Moreover, I  do not think  that the court's  error should\nescape  review  merely because  it  entered  into the  record\nspecific   findings  about   the   \"demeanor\"   and   visible\n\"sincerity\" of each of the juror's answers to the question.\n\n8.  To  bolster its  affirmance, the  majority refers  to the\nnumerous occasions  on which  the district court,  before the\njuror misconduct allegations surfaced, instructed the jury on\nthe  burden  of  proof.   Those  instructions  are,  however,\nutterly irrelevant in determining whether the district court,\nlater in the trial, made statements or gave instructions that\nmay have negated the presumption of innocence.\n\n                            -34-\n                             34\n\ntrial.9  Any other  result denies these defendants  a \"`basic\n\nprotection'\" afforded by the Constitution, a protection which\n\nreflects \"`a  profound judgment  about the  way in  which law\n\nshould be  enforced and justice administered.'\"   Sullivan v.\n                                                         \n\n                   \n\n9.  I  further  note  that  the  majority  opinion  does  not\nadequately address  the district  court's failure to  inquire\ninto Juror Luis Carrero Roman's admission that members of the\njury had,  in fact,  conversed about  the case.   As  we made\nclear in United  States v.  Richman, 600 F.2d  286, 295  (1st\n                                  \nCir. 1979), a trial court  should conduct the following four-\npart inquiry when faced with allegations that jurors may have\nacted improperly:\n\n         [1]  ascertain   whether  the  misconduct\n         actually   occurred;   [2]  if   it  did,\n         determine whether it was prejudicial; [3]\n         if not clearly unprejudicial, grant a new\n         trial; [and] [4]  specify reasons if  the\n         court   determines    either   that   the\n         misconduct did  not take place or was not\n         clearly prejudicial. \n\nId. (citing United States  v. Doe, 513 F.2d 709,  711-12 (1st\n                                \nCir. 1975)).   Here, after learning  from Juror Carrero  that\nmembers  of the  jury  had discussed  the case,  the district\ncourt  failed to inquire further and refused to allow defense\ncounsel  to interject follow-up questions.   As a result, the\nrecord contains  no evidence about what  types of discussions\n                  \nJuror Carrero may  have had  with other jurors,  or may  have\noverheard.   We are left to  speculate.  In light  of all the\ncircumstances, I  consider this error an  alternative grounds\nfor reversal. \n    Furthermore, I cannot agree with the majority's cavalier\nconclusion  that  \"the  judge essentially  conducted  a full-\nfledged  inquiry when  he  asked the  other jurors  questions\nwhich  would have  revealed precisely  the impropriety  which\nJudge  Stahl fears.\"    Ante, at  16 n.2.   First  the record\n                           \ncontains  no such  \"full-fledged inquiry\";  and, second,  any\ninquiry  of  \"the  other  jurors\"  could  not  possibly  have\nrevealed  anything about  what Juror  Carrero did or  did not\nknow  about  the  putative  juror misconduct.    It  appears,\ntherefore, that the once  strict requirements of Richman have\n                                                       \nbeen relaxed to such an extent that a district court  now has\ndiscretion, according to the majority, to conduct essentially\nno inquiry at all.\n \n\n                            -35-\n                             35\n\nLouisiana, No. 92-5129, 1993  WL 179275, at *4 (U.S.  June 1,\n        \n\n1993)  (quoting  Duncan  v,  Louisiana,  391  U.S.  145,  155\n                                     \n\n(1968)).

This\n\ntrial  was part of the serial prosecution of some 55 members\n\nof   a  large   scale  drug  importation   and  distribution\n\norganization  known  as  \"La   Nena.\"    Of  their  numerous\n\nassertions of error, the most serious is the denial of their\n\nmotions for  a mistrial  after discovery by  the court  that\n\nfour of  the jurors had  arrived at a  conclusion concerning\n\nguilt prior to the presentation of the defendants' evidence.\n\nWe  reserve our  discussion  of this  difficult issue  until\n\nlast.\n\nl. Sufficiency of evidence.\n                          \n\n          All  defendants challenge  the sufficiency  of the\n\nevidence against them because the government's case depended\n\non    the   testimony    of   Geraldo    Portalatin   Toledo\n\n(\"Portalatin\"),  a  leading member  of  the  \"La Nena\"  drug\n\norganization.   Defendants argue that Portalatin's testimony\n\nwas so  unreliable and so  sketchy as  to them, that  it was\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ninsufficient  as  a matter  of law.   Portalatin  was cross-\n\nexamined  concerning his  deals  with the  government.   The\n\njudge gave  complete and correct instructions  detailing the\n\nspecial care the jury should take in assessing the testimony\n\nof an accomplice.   Under these circumstances, an accomplice\n\nis a qualified witness and the credibility of the witness is\n\nfor the jury.  United States v.

Portalatin testified that Ortiz Arrigoitia\n\nand  Medina  Vazquez  helped  unload  various  shipments  of\n\nmarijuana and cocaine and  Ortiz Cameron participated in the\n\nunloading  and  distribution  of  a  load  of  cocaine  at a\n\n\"clandestine  airfield\" at  La  Furnia Farm  in Barceloneta,\n\nPuerto Rico.    Portalatin's  evidence,  if  believed,  when\n\nconsidered  with   the  other  evidence  in   the  case  was\n\nsufficient    to   support    conviction   by    the   jury,\n\nnotwithstanding  Portalatin's  unsavory   history  and   the\n\ncontrary evidence presented by the defendants.\n\n2.  Improper admission of testimony.\n                                   \n\n          Ortiz  Cameron  further   asserts  error  in   the\n\nadmission of evidence.  Portalatin testified that the driver\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nof  a Chevrolet \"power wagon\" (apparently a four-wheel-drive\n\ntruck) which was used  to remove the cargo of  cocaine after\n\nan  incoming plane crashed at   Furnia was  \"Hiram,\" whom he\n\nidentified  as  Luis  Hiram Ortiz  Cameron,  the  defendant.\n\nPortalatin had been  in the plane which  crashed, had bumped\n\nhis head,  had pulled  the pilot  out of  the plane and  had\n\ndescribed  himself as  \"shaken\"  by the  experience.   Ortiz\n\nCameron argues  that  Portalatin's  condition  made  him  so\n\nunreliable that his testimony  should not have been allowed.\n\nThere  is no  evidence,  however, that  he  was in  any  way\n\nincapacitated.   He  pulled the  pilot  from the  plane  and\n\nhelped  salvage the cargo.   He then spent  two hours beside\n\n\"Hiram\"  as  the  latter  drove  the  \"power  wagon\"  to the\n\ndestination of  the contraband.   Under such  circumstances,\n\nhis credibility was for the jury.\n\n          During  the  cross-examination of  Portalatin, the\n\ndefense  attorney   discovered  for  the  first   time  that\n\nPortalatin, during his debriefing  by government agents, was\n\nshown a picture of Ortiz Cameron.  He immediately identified\n\nthe picture, saying \"That's Hiram.\"  It does not appear that\n\nany  suggestive comment was made.  This picture was not part\n\nof a  spread, however, and it was shown to Portalatin in the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ncourse of the discussion of his participation in the various\n\ndrug transactions.\n\n          Defense counsel moved that  Portalatin's testimony\n\nconcerning  Ortiz  Cameron   be  stricken  as   unacceptably\n\ntainted.  Among other  reasons, he asserted that he  had not\n\nbeen shown the photograph in question, and that the evidence\n\npacket  furnished by  the  prosecution contained  copies  of\n\nphotographs which  were simply  blotches of white  on black.\n\nThe prosecutor replied that  all defendants had been invited\n\nto  the office of the United  States Attorney to view all of\n\nthe government's hundreds of exhibits, but that none of them\n\nhad taken  advantage of  the opportunity.   The  trial judge\n\nmade  no  explicit  finding,  but  apparently  accepted  the\n\nprosecution's explanation.  He offered to suspend the trial,\n\nhowever,  to  provide  defense  counsel  an  opportunity  to\n\nexamine the photo  and to develop  any evidence of  improper\n\nsuggestion.  Counsel declined  and proceeded with the cross-\n\nexamination of Portalatin.   Not until eight days later,  at\n\nthe close of all  the evidence, did counsel move  for a voir\n                                                            \n\ndire  of Portalatin  to explore  any  possible taint.   This\n    \n\nuntimely motion was denied.\n\n          The   reliability   of  identification   testimony\n\nallegedly tainted by reason  of an impermissibly  suggestive\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nphotograph should be resolved after consideration of all the\n\ncircumstances.

In  this case, it would appear  that Portalatin\n\nhad  spent over two hours  in the close  company of \"Hiram,\"\n\nalbeit at night and under difficult circumstances.   He knew\n\nHiram's first name before the photograph was identified.\n\n          The district judge's offer to suspend the trial to\n\npermit further investigation was refused.  The defendant was\n\ndoubtless entitled to a  voir dire examination of Portalatin\n                                  \n\nbefore proceeding with the cross-examination,  but certainly\n\nnot eight days  later.  There was no error  in the denial of\n\nhis untimely motion.   Similarly,  we find no  error in  the\n\ntrial judge's decision to permit Portalatin's identification\n\nto stand.  \n\n          Ortiz Cameron  also alleges error in the admission\n\nof testimony  concerning his  disappearance from  his normal\n\nwhereabouts immediately  after the  \"La Furnia\"  episode and\n\nconcerning his wealth,  which the government asserted  could\n\nonly be explained by his participation in illicit drug deals\n\nover  a period of time.  The defendant had ample opportunity\n\nto  rebut such  testimony.

There\n\nare two issues that  arise in this context.   First, we must\n\ndecide whether  the district court's finding regarding juror\n\nimpartiality was clearly erroneous.   Second, we must decide\n\nwhether  a   remark  made   by  the  district   court  while\n\ninvestigating the question  of juror impartiality improperly\n\nshifted  the burden of proof.  While these two questions are\n\nfactually intertwined  in this case,  they are  analytically\n\ndistinct, and we therefore consider them seriatim.\n                                                 \n\n                      A.  Background.\n                                     \n\n          At the  close of the government's  case, the judge\n\nwas advised that the daughter of a juror, who had been daily\n\naccompanying her mother  to the court, had been  observed in\n\nprolonged conversation with a  young woman identified as the\n\ngirl friend of  the defendant Ortiz  Cameron.  The  district\n\njudge  then interviewed  the  daughter and  her mother,  the\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\njuror.  It appeared from these interviews that the juror had\n\ndiscussed  the case  at length  with  her daughter,  and had\n\nexpressed  very definite  views about  the testimony  of the\n\ngovernment's  witnesses.   The  daughter  also reported  her\n\nunderstanding from  talking with her mother  that the jurors\n\nhad discussed the case among themselves.  The juror was then\n\nsegregated from the other jurors and later excused.  \n\n          The  judge then  summoned all  of the  jurors into\n\nchambers, one by one, and asked them the following series of\n\nquestions:\n\n          l.   At this  point, have you  discussed with  the\n          jurors or  anyone else  the guilt or  innocence of\n          the defendants?\n\n          2.   Have you  discussed with  the other\n          jurors or with  anyone the reputation of\n          the defendants?\n\n          3.   Have  you discussed with  the other\n          jurors   or   with   anyone   else   the\n          credibility of any of the witnesses?\n\n          4.   At this  point, have you  reached a\n          decision   regarding    the   guilt   or\n          innocence of the defendants?\n\nAll  of  the  jurors except  one  answered  the first  three\nquestions in the negative.   One juror said that  he thought\n\nhe  had  heard some  comment about  the  case but  could not\n\nremember what it was about.  Four  jurors, however, answered\n\nthe fourth question in the affirmative, indicating that they\n\nhad reached a decision concerning the  guilt or innocence of\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nthe defendants.  The judge then  recalled these four jurors,\n\nagain one at a time, and addressed each one as follows: \n\n          As I instructed you before, the guilt or\n          innocence of the  defendants is  decided\n          after  listening to all the evidence, to\n          the  final  summations of  the attorneys\n          and after applying  the instructions  as\n          to the law to be given by me.\n\n          And my question is, would you be able to\n          keep an  open mind and in  the course of\n          your  deliberations   with  your  fellow\n          jurors,  re-examine  your own  views and\n          change your opinion  if convinced it  is\n          erroneous?\n\nAll  four  of  the   jurors  answered  emphatically  in  the\n\naffirmative.  The  district judge then declared that  he was\n\nsatisfied  that  the  jurors  would  carry  out  their  duty\n\nproperly,  based on  their  answers and  his observation  of\n\ntheir demeanor.\n\n          Counsel for Ortiz  Cameron and counsel  for Medina\n\nVazquez (and  counsel for another defendant  whose appeal is\n\nnot  before us)  moved for  a mistrial.   Counsel  for Ortiz\n\nArrigoitia expressly  declined to so  move at that  time and\n\njoined in the motion only at the very end of  the case, just\n\nbefore  closing  arguments.    In response  to  the  judge's\n\ncomment, counsel  for Ortiz Arrigoitia admitted  that he had\n\ninitially refrained from joining  the motion for the purpose\n\nof claiming double  jeopardy if the motion  had been granted\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nwithout his consent.   It is  our view that  a motion for  a\n\nmistrial  should  be made  promptly.   This  was no  case of\n\nmistake  or inadvertence,  but one  of deliberate  delay for\n\ntactical purposes.   Failure  to  make a  timely motion  for\n\nmistrial under these circumstances constitutes  a waiver and\n\nprecludes consideration of this issue on appeal with respect\n\nto Ortiz  Arrigoitia.   Cf.

The  trial judge  is not,\n\nhowever, shackled  to a rigid  and unyielding set  rules and\n\nprocedures  that  compel any  particular  form  or scope  of\n\ninquiry.    Rather, in  light  of  the  infinite variety  of\n\nsituations in which juror  misconduct might be discerned and\n\nthe need to protect  jurors and the jury process  from undue\n\nimposition, the trial judge is vested with the discretion to\n\nfashion   an  appropriate   and  responsible   procedure  to\n\ndetermine whether misconduct  actually occurred and  whether\n\nit was  prejudicial.  Boylan, 898  F.2d at 258.   As we have\n                            \n\noften  explained, \"A  district court  has broad,  though not\n\nunlimited, discretion to determine  the extent and nature of\n\nits  inquiry into allegations  of juror bias.\"   Corbin, 590\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 400.\n\n          In this  case, upon  discovering that a  juror may\n\nhave  spoken  about  the  trial  to  her  eighteen  year-old\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\ndaughter,  the district court immediately summoned the juror\n\nand  the daughter to chambers for separate interviews in the\n\npresence of all counsel.   The juror confirmed that  she had\n\nspoken to her daughter about the defendants, but denied that\n\nshe had  talked to  the other jurors  about the  case.   The\n\ndistrict  court promptly segregated  the juror and announced\n\nhis  intention  to  interview  individually  all  jurors  to\n\ndetermine  if any others  had been  tainted.   The following\n\nmorning  all  jurors  denied  speaking  about  the  case  to\n\noutsiders or each  other, though  one thought  he had  heard\n\nsome  comment  among  the  jurors  about  the  case  without\n\nidentifying  what  those comments  concerned.   Counsel were\n\npresent but  were not  permitted to participate  directly in\n\nthe interviews; however, the questions posed by the judge to\n\nthe  jurors  reflected   concerns  previously  expressed  by\n\ncounsel.  Counsel has no right to pose specific questions to\n\na  juror or to pursue every desired  avenue of inquiry.  The\n\ncontrol and direction of  a court's investigation into juror\n\nmisconduct is  within the discretion of  the district court,\n\nnot defense counsel.  Corbin, 590 F.2d at 400.\n                            \n\n          After  interviewing all  the  jurors and  relevant\n\nthird parties,  consulting with  counsel,  and weighing  the\n\ntestimony, demeanor, and credibility of the various parties,\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nthe  court found  the jurors  were not  partial.   The trial\n\ncourt conducted an adequate  investigation into the  alleged\n\nmisconduct  and reached  a reasonable  conclusion about  the\n\njurors'  impartiality.   Ortiz  Cameron  and Medina  Vazquez\n\npresent no compelling  evidence to the contrary  and we find\n\nnothing  in the  record that  leads us  to believe  that the\n\ndistrict  court's  investigation   was  inadequate  or   his\n\nfindings clearly erroneous.2\n\n                    C. Remark By Judge.\n                                       \n\n          It  is  also  suggested that  the  district  court\n\nshifted the burden of  proof when it asked the  four jurors:\n\n\"would you be able to keep an open mind and in the course of\n\nyour deliberations  with your fellow  jurors, reexamine your\n\nown  views  and  change  your  opinion  if  convinced it  is\n\nerroneous?\"  Although recognizing that the judge's remark is\n\n                    \n\n2Our  dissenting colleague  suggests an  \"alternative ground\nfor  reversal\" --  the district  court's failure  to inquire\ninto  Juror  Carrero-Roman's statement  that members  of the\njury  had  discussed  the  case.    See  Stahl,  n.9.    The\n                                       \ndefendants, however, have not specifically argued this issue\non appeal.  In any event, we do not consider the alternative\nground to be meritorious.   Juror Carrero-Roman's answer was\nextremely indefinite and, on the facts of this case, did not\nrequire  a  full-fledged judicial  inquiry.   Moreover,  the\njudge essentially conducted  a full-fledged inquiry when  he\nasked the  other jurors questions which  would have revealed\nprecisely the impropriety which Judge Stahl fears.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nless  than a  textbook model,  we do  not view  the language\n\nemployed,  in   the  specific  context  of   this  case,  as\n\nsuggesting that  the defendants  bore the burden  of proving\n\ntheir innocence.\n\n          First, the judge's  remark was not an  instruction\n\nat  all but a question asked mid-trial  in the context of an\n\ninvestigation we have  otherwise held to be sufficient.  See\n                                                            \n\nsupra  Part  A.   Second, the  question  -- even  if somehow\n     \n\ndeemed to be  an instruction -- did not place  the burden of\n\nproof on any  specific party  but merely  asked whether  the\n\njurors  retained the  ability  to reexamine  their views  in\n\nlight   of   further  developments.     Indeed,   the  judge\n\nscrupulously  avoided  indicating what  particular  views he\n\nthought the  jurors possessed and instead  referred only the\n\njurors' ability to change their \"opinion,\" whatever it might\n\nbe.   Third,  again assuming  that the  question were  to be\n\ndeemed  an  instruction, the  defendants  did  not give  the\n\ndistrict court an opportunity  to cure it by, at  any stage,\n\nproposing a sound alternative instruction.\n\n          And,  finally,  assuming  the  question   were  an\n\ninstruction,  it must be viewed in the context of the entire\n\njury charge.  See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 244; see  also Cupp v.\n                                                            \n\nNaughten, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108888\"><a href=\"/opinion/108888/cupp-v-naughten/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146-47 (1973) (\"a single instruction\n        \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nto  a  jury may  not  be judged  in  artificial isolation\").\n\nHere, in  his pre-deliberations  charge, the judge  at least\n\nten times  explicitly and directly instructed  the jury that\n\nthe  government bore  the burden of  proof.3   Moreover, the\n\njudge himself placed his previous questioning of the jury in\n\ncontext when he stated:\n\n          Except for my instructions to you on the\n          law, you should disregard anything I may\n          have  said during the  trial in arriving\n          at your own findings as to the facts.\n\nAny slight  ambiguity created by the  mid-trial reference to\n\nan  \"open  mind,\" then,  is  adequately  dispelled once  the\n\n                    \n\n3To provide just two examples, the judge stated:\n\n               Indeed the  defendants are presumed\n          by law to be innocent.  The law does not\n          require  the  defendant  to   prove  his\n          innocence or produce any evidence at all\n          and no inference whatsoever may be drawn\n          from the election of a defendant  not to\n          testify.\n\n               The   government,   that   is   the\n          prosecution[,]   has   the   burden   of\n          providing  or  proving the[  defendants]\n          guilty beyond a  reasonable doubt and if\n          he fails to do so, you must acquit them.\n\nLater, the judge repeated  that \"it is up to  the government\nto prove the[ defendants] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nElsewhere in the charge the judge continually instructed the\njury that the government  bore the burden of proof  beyond a\nreasonable  doubt  with  regard  to  each  element  of  each\noffense.\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\n\"instruction\" is viewed in the context of these other, ample\n\ninstructions.4\n\n          We find  further support  for our conclusion  in a\n\nfifth  factor --  circuit precedent.   See United  States v.\n                                                            \n\nNickens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577009\"><a href=\"/opinion/577009/united-states-v-david-lloyd-nickens/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  118-19 (1st Cir. 1992).   In Nickens\n                                                            \n\nthe district judge, in his opening charge to the jury and in\n                                                         \n\nremarks made  to the jury after  closing arguments, actually\n\nissued an \"open mind\" instruction  very similar to the  mid-\n                                 \n\ntrial question  asked here.  In finding that the instruction\n\nwas  not plain error, we held  that it \"merely told the jury\n\nnot to evaluate the  evidence it would be hearing  until the\n\nevidence  was  all  in  and   the  court  had  rendered  its\n\ninstructions.\"  Id. at 118.  We further noted that:\n                   \n\n          Telling  a  jury  to  postpone  making a\n          final  judgment  until all  the evidence\n          has  been  presented, does  not instruct\n          the jury as to the weight or effect that\n          should be  given to  any aspect of  that\n          evidence  -- nor  to the  presumption of\n          innocence  --  when  making their  final\n          judgment.\n\nId. at 119.  Given this precedent, and given the  four case-\n   \n\nspecific  factors  we  have  identified, we  find  that  the\n\n                    \n\n4We note,  however, that this entire  situation could easily\nhave been  avoided had the  judge instructed the  jurors, at\nthe  time this issue arose,  that the burden  of proving the\ndefendants' guilt always rests with the government.\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nremarks  made by  the district  judge did  not impermissibly\n\nshift the burden of proof.5\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n5The judge below also made a mid-trial \"open mind\" statement\nwhich  is more easily construed as an \"instruction.\"  As the\ndissent   acknowledges,  however,  no  one  challenged  this\nstatement at any  stage.  If we were to  review it, then, it\nwould  be  under a  plain  error  rubric and  Nickens  would\n                                                     \ndirectly control.\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n         STAHL,  Circuit Judge, (Dissenting).  With respect,\n         STAHL,  Circuit Judge, (Dissenting).\n                              \n\nI  dissent from the  majority opinion because  I believe that\n\nthe  district  court's  response  to  the  juror   misconduct\n\nallegations in this case obliges us to grant defendants a new\n\ntrial.  With  regard to  this issue, the  majority rests  its\n\naffirmance on the well-established  rule that district courts\n\nhave discretion  \"to fashion  an appropriate  and responsible\n\nprocedure  to determine  whether [juror]  misconduct actually\n\noccurred  and  whether  it was  prejudicial.\"    Ante,  at 15\n                                                    \n\n(citing Boylan,  898 F.2d  at 258).    While I  agree that  a\n             \n\ndistrict court  has broad discretion to  determine the nature\n                                                            \n\nof its inquiry into allegations of juror misconduct, I do not\n\nthink that that discretion is  so broad as to permit  a court\n\nto commit errors of constitutional dimension while performing\n\nthat inquiry.\n\n         Here, the  district court, in its  effort to assess\n\nwhether juror  misconduct had occurred, selected  a method of\n\ninquiry  which had the effect, in my opinion, of shifting the\n\nburden  of  proof  from  the government  to  the  defendants.\n\nMoreover, the court's failure properly to instruct the jurors\n\nof the government's burden of proof compounded the error.  As\n\na result, I  am of the opinion that the  motions for mistrial\n\nshould  have  been  granted.   For  these  reasons,  I  would\n\nreverse.\n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\n         This case, in my  view, cannot properly be resolved\n\nwithout  a detailed  summary  of the  events surrounding  the\n\ncourt's  response to  the  juror misconduct  allegations.   I\n\nbegin therefore with a recitation of these facts.  \n\n         When  the  question  of  possible  juror misconduct\n\narose, the district judge immediately and correctly commenced\n\nan  interrogation of  a young  woman, the  daughter  of Juror\n\nGonzales,  who had  been seen  conversing with  a defendant's\n\ngirlfriend.   During the inquiry,  it became apparent  to the\n\ncourt that  the daughter  and the defendant's  girlfriend had\n\ndiscussed that  defendant's innocence.  It  also became clear\n\nthat the daughter had discussed many aspects of the case with\n\nher  mother, Juror  Gonzales.   As a  result, the  court then\n\ninterrogated Ms. Gonzales.  \n\n         Juror  Gonzales  admitted that  she had  engaged in\n\ndiscussions with her  daughter about the  case.  She  denied,\n\nhowever, having  expressed  any opinion  as to  the guilt  or\n\ninnocence of  the defendants,  and  generally downplayed  the\n\nextent  and content of the discussions.  She also stated that\n\nno  juror had  indicated  an  opinion  as  to  the  guilt  or\n\ninnocence of the defendants.  \n\n         At    the    conclusion    of   Juror    Gonzales's\n\ninterrogation,  counsel  for  defendant  Diaz  Fernandez  and\n\ncounsel for defendant Ortiz Cameron moved for a mistrial.  In\n\nresponse, the court first indicated that it did not intend to\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\nquestion  any  of  the other  jurors.    The AUSA  requested,\n\nhowever,  that the court reconsider that decision.  The court\n\nthen indicated that it  would take no action on  the mistrial\n\nmotions  that  evening  but  would  decide  what  to  do  the\n\nfollowing  morning.    Ortiz  Cameron's  attorney  then,  for\n\nunexplained reasons, retracted his motion for mistrial.\n\n         The   following   morning,   the  court   commenced\n\ninterrogations  of  each  of  the  remaining  twelve  jurors,\n\nbeginning with the jury foreman.  Counsel took no part in the\n\nformulation of the following four questions: \n\n         (1) At this point have you discussed with\n         the other jurors or with  anyone else the\n         guilt  or  innocence  of the  defendants?\n         (2) Have  you  discussed with  the  other\n         jurors or with  anyone the reputation  of\n         the defendants?   (3) Have  you discussed\n         with the other jurors or with anyone else\n         the credibility of the defendants? (4) At\n                                            (4) At\n         this  point have  you reached  a decision\n         regarding  the guilt or  innocence of the\n         defendants?  \n         defendants?\n\n         The foreman and eight  of the other jurors answered\n\n\"no\" to all four  questions.  One  of those jurors, Mr.  Luis\n\nCarrero  Roman,  however,  answered question  three  with the\n\nstatement: \"Well,  I can say it is hard  for me to say yes or\n\nno  because yes, we made comments between us but nothing that\n\nI  can  say  yes or  no.\"    Four  other jurors  (hereinafter\n\nreferred   to  collectively  as   \"the  four  jurors\")  while\n\nanswering \"no\"  to the first three  questions, answered \"yes\"\n\nto the critical fourth question.  \n\n                            -27-\n                             27\n\n         At this juncture,  the Court individually  recalled\n\nthe four  jurors.  The court  then asked the  four jurors one\n\nquestion,  a question  which,  in my  opinion, was  seriously\n\nleading.   Before asking  the  question, the  court made  the\n\nfollowing statement:  \n\n         As I instructed you  before, the guilt or\n         innocence  of  the defendants  is decided\n         after listening to  all the evidence,  to\n         the final summations of the attorneys and\n         after applying the instructions as to the\n         law to be given by me.\n\nThe court followed this statement with:  \n\n         And my question is,  would you be able to\n         keep an  open mind  and in the  course of\n         your   deliberations  with   your  fellow\n         jurors,  re-examine  your  own views  and\n         change  your opinion  if convinced  it is\n         erroneous?\n\nEach  of  the  four  jurors answered  this  question  in  the\n\naffirmative.    Juror Luis  Carrero  Roman,  who admitted  to\n\nhaving  engaged in  discussions  with other  jurors, was  not\n\nrecalled.  At no time did the court allow counsel to speak or\n\nto propose  follow-up  questions.    Indeed,  throughout  the\n                                                       \n\ninquiry, the court refused to allow  defense counsel to utter\n\nso much as a word.\n\n         After  the   inquiry  ended,  however,   the  court\n\nentertained objections.  Counsel for  Diaz Fernandez objected\n\nboth  to the  length of  the court's  interrogations and  the\n\nleading  nature of the revised question.  He also pointed out\n\nthat some jurors  had stated that they either had discussions\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\nwith one another or had already made up their minds.  Counsel\n\nthen  renewed his motion for a mistrial, stressing his belief\n\nthat  no instruction  could cure  the problem.   Counsel  for\n       \n\ndefendant Ortiz Cameron then  joined the motion for mistrial,\n\narguing   that  the   presumption  of   innocence   had  been\n\ncompromised.   Counsel for defendant Ortiz  Arrigoitia, while\n\nobjecting to the court's juror questions, nonetheless did not\n\njoin the motion for mistrial. \n\n         At that point, the AUSA also expressed concern with\n\nthe court's inquiry: \n\n         [O]ne  thing  concerns me,  and  it is  a\n         point  brought  up  by [defense  counsel]\n         concerning  the  instructions  that  have\n         been given by the Court to the petit jury\n         to the  effect that  they should  keep an\n         open  mind at  all  times until  the end.\n         And  apparently  these  four  jurors,  at\n         least, have not  kept an open  mind until\n         the end of the proceedings.\n\nAs a result  of these concerns, the  AUSA urged the  court to\n\nenter specific  findings  as to  the \"demeanor\"  of the  four\n\njurors:  \n\n         . . . I  would ask that the  court make[]\n         findings  to the  effect  that [the  four\n         jurors] appear[ed] to be quite  sincere .\n         .  . .  The bottom  line is,  Your Honor,\n         this  is  a  due process  issue,  whether\n         these defendants are  being afforded  due\n         process  by these  jurors,  and  to  that\n         effect, I believe the Court would have to\n         enter a finding that yes, they  can, they\n         are willing and able to keep an open mind\n         and to reach a decision at the end of the\n         case  based  upon  the  evidence  and the\n         instructions  given by the court. I would\n         think  it is  a close  shot, but  I think\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\n         there is  sufficient information received\n         by the  Court through the  questioning to\n         make a decision.   \n\n         Immediately  thereafter,  the  court   entered  the\n\nfollowing statement for the record: \n\n         All right.  This  is a matter of deciding\n         whether these jurors, especially the four\n         jurors  that  we  have   questioned,  are\n         sincere and will be willing to give these\n         defendants   all  due  process.    And  I\n         believe[,]  and I  so find[,]  that these\n         jurors are sincere  and in  the same  way\n         they  expressed an opinion that they have\n         reached  a decision as  of now, they also\n         sincerely are  able to keep an  open mind\n         and re-examine their own views .  . . . I\n         was  impressed by  the  sincerity of  the\n         answers  and the expressions  in the face\n         of  each  juror when  I asked  the second\n         part of the last question . . . .\n\nThe  court  then denied  the  pending  motions for  mistrial.\n\nSubsequently, counsel  for defendant Pedro Rivera  joined the\n\nmotions for mistrial. \n\n         The  court then decided  to excuse  Juror Gonzales,\n\nwhose discussions  with her daughter had  inspired the entire\n\ninquiry, a decision approved  by all counsel.  When  the jury\n\nreconvened, the court instructed it as follows:\n\n         So, I  again  repeat my  instructions  to\n         you, not  to form or  express an  opinion\n         regarding the  guilt or innocence  of the\n         defendant, to keep  an open mind.   Don't\n         discuss the case among yourselves or with\n         anyone else.  Keep an open mind.   \n\nNo one objected to this instruction. \n\n         The   court's  final   instructions  to   the  jury\n\ncontained the following:\n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\n         The indictment or  formal charge  against\n         the defendant  is not evidence  of guilt.\n         Indeed the defendants are presumed by law\n         to be innocent.  The law does not require\n         the defendant  to prove his  innocence or\n         produce  any  evidence  at  all   and  no\n         inference  whatsoever  may be  drawn from\n         the  election  of  the defendant  not  to\n         testify. \n\n         Under the law a  defendant may or may not\n         testify as  he elects  since it is  up to\n         the  government  to  prove   them  guilty\n         beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  as  I  said\n         before.  The  law  does  not  require the\n         defendant to take  the witness stand  and\n         testify and  no presumption of  guilt may\n         be raised  and no  inference of  any kind\n         may  be drawn from defendant's failure to\n         testify.\n\n         In   addition,   the  court   gave   several  other\n\n\"reasonable  doubt\" instructions  in connection  with various\n\naspects  of  the  case.     At  no  time,  however,   did  it\n\nunequivocally instruct that the burden of proof was always on\n            \n\nthe government.6  \n\n                   \n\n6.  In its initial  charge to the jury,  the court instructed\non the government's burden as follows:\n\n         The indictment or  formal charge  against\n         the  defendant is not  evidence of guilt.\n         Indeed the     defendants are presumed by\n         law  to be  innocent.   The law  does not\n         require  the  defendant   to  prove   his\n         innocence  or produce any evidence at all\n         and no inference  whatsoever may be drawn\n         from the  election of a defendant  not to\n         testify. \n\n         The government, that  is the  prosecution\n         has  the burden  of providing  or proving\n         them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and\n         if  he (sic)  fails  to do  so, you  must\n         acquit them. Thus, while the government's\n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\n         The  majority concludes  that  the  district  court\n\nreached a reasonable conclusion about the impartiality of the\n\njurors and that defendants  Ortiz Cameron and Medina Vazquez:\n\n         present  no  compelling  evidence to  the\n         contrary  and  we  find  nothing  in  the\n         record that  leads us to believe that the\n         district   court's   investigation    was\n         inadequate   or   his  findings   clearly\n         erroneous.\n\nAnte, at 16.   Respectfully,  my review of  that same  record\n   \n\nleads me to the opposite conclusion. \n\n         When faced with four  jurors who admitted that they\n\nhad formed an  opinion about  the guilt or  innocence of  the\n\ndefendants, the district court brought these four jurors into\n\nchambers  again and, in  my view, structured  the \"open mind\"\n\nquestion in such  a way  that \"yes\" was  the only  acceptable\n                                                \n\nresponse.  Before asking  the question, the court effectively\n\nadmonished the four jurors, reminding them of its instruction\n\nat the beginning of the trial to determine guilt or innocence\n\nonly after hearing all of the evidence.  One does  not need a\n\ndegree  in  psychology to  understand  the  effect that  this\n\nstatement  had on  the  four jurors'  ability to  answer this\n\ncritical \"question\" in a calm and uninhibited manner.  \n\n         At pages 17-19 of the majority opinion, my brethren\n\noffer  five  reasons  why this  question  did  not,  in their\n\n                   \n\n         burden of  proof  is a  strict  or  heavy\n         burden,  it  is  not necessary  that  the\n         defendant's  guilt  be proved  beyond all\n         doubt. \n\n                            -32-\n                             32\n\nestimation,  shift the burden of proof.   I do not think that\n\nany  one  of  these  five  points  sufficiently  answers  the\n\nproblem.   With the first  four points,  I am afraid  that my\n\ncolleagues have ceded analysis to semantics, and have exalted\n\nform  over substance.   I  cannot join  in such  an approach,\n\nparticularly where, as here, the fundamental right to  a fair\n\ntrial is at stake.\n\n         As  to  the  majority's  fifth point  -  i.e.,  its\n                                                      \n\nreliance  upon   Nickens,  955   F.2d  at  118-19,   for  the\n                       \n\nproposition that  the judge's \"open  mind\" instruction  cured\n\nany such shifting of the burden of  proof - I am baffled.  In\n\nNickens, we  upheld almost identical \"open mind\" instructions\n      \n\nonly after acknowledging that they were problematic.  See id.\n                                                            \n\nat 118  (affirming  instructions \"[w]ithout  endorsing  their\n\nform\").   We were  analyzing those instructions  to determine\n\nwhether they alone had the effect of negating the presumption\n                 \n\nof  innocence.   We reasoned  that those  instructions \"would\n\n[not]  normally suggest  to  the jury  that the  government's\n              \n\nburden of proving  guilt is  equal to  defendant's burden  of\n\nproving  innocence.\"    Id.  (emphasis  supplied).    Finding\n                          \n\nnothing  extraordinary in  that case,  we concluded  that the\n\ninstructions were  not \"so  egregious as to  constitute plain\n\nerror.\"  Id.\n           \n\n         Here,  however, we  are  not reviewing  this  \"open\n\nmind\"  instruction  to determine  whether  it  alone had  the\n\n                            -33-\n                             33\n\neffect of negating the presumption of  innocence.  Rather, we\n\nmust determine whether this otherwise problematic instruction\n\ncured the multi-layered burden of proof problems presented by\n    \n\nthis case.  I  think it obvious that this  instruction cannot\n\nand  should  not  be  viewed  as  curative.7    As  such,  my\n\ncolleagues'  reference  to  Nickens as  controlling  \"circuit\n                                  \n\nprecedent\" is entirely unpersuasive.\n\n         In  sum,  it  is  my strong  opinion  that  when he\n\nreconvened  the jury,  the trial  judge had an  obligation to\n\ncure any potential misperceptions  his colloquy may have left\n                                     \n\nin the minds of  the four jurors on the  fundamental question\n\nof who bears the burden of proof.  Waiting until the very end\n\nof  a lengthy  trial to  instruct the  jury properly  on this\n\nquestion  does  not  alleviate  the prejudice.8    Under  any\n                                                         any\n                                                            \n\nstandard  of  review, I  think  these  convictions should  be\n\nreversed and that defendants should be granted a new and fair\n\n                   \n\n7.  Moreover, I  do not think  that the court's  error should\nescape  review  merely because  it  entered  into the  record\nspecific   findings  about   the   \"demeanor\"   and   visible\n\"sincerity\" of each of the juror's answers to the question.\n\n8.  To  bolster its  affirmance, the  majority refers  to the\nnumerous occasions  on which  the district court,  before the\njuror misconduct allegations surfaced, instructed the jury on\nthe  burden  of  proof.   Those  instructions  are,  however,\nutterly irrelevant in determining whether the district court,\nlater in the trial, made statements or gave instructions that\nmay have negated the presumption of innocence.\n\n                            -34-\n                             34\n\ntrial.9  Any other  result denies these defendants  a \"`basic\n\nprotection'\" afforded by the Constitution, a protection which\n\nreflects \"`a  profound judgment  about the  way in  which law\n\nshould be  enforced and justice administered.'\"   Sullivan v.\n                                                         \n\n                   \n\n9.  I  further  note  that  the  majority  opinion  does  not\nadequately address  the district  court's failure to  inquire\ninto Juror Luis Carrero Roman's admission that members of the\njury had,  in fact,  conversed about  the case.   As  we made\nclear in United  States v.  Richman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367065\"><a href=\"/opinion/367065/united-states-v-harold-richman-united-states-of-america-v-george-pappas/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295  (1st\n                                  \nCir. 1979), a trial court  should conduct the following four-\npart inquiry when faced with allegations that jurors may have\nacted improperly:\n\n         [1]  ascertain   whether  the  misconduct\n         actually   occurred;   [2]  if   it  did,\n         determine whether it was prejudicial; [3]\n         if not clearly unprejudicial, grant a new\n         trial; [and] [4]  specify reasons if  the\n         court   determines    either   that   the\n         misconduct did  not take place or was not\n         clearly prejudicial. \n\nId. (citing United States  v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326726\"><a href=\"/opinion/326726/united-states-v-john-doe-aka-angel-l-camacho-aka-angel-lopez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  711-12 (1st\n                                \nCir. 1975)).   Here, after learning  from Juror Carrero  that\nmembers  of the  jury  had discussed  the case,  the district\ncourt  failed to inquire further and refused to allow defense\ncounsel  to interject follow-up questions.   As a result, the\nrecord contains  no evidence about what  types of discussions\n                  \nJuror Carrero may  have had  with other jurors,  or may  have\noverheard.   We are left to  speculate.  In light  of all the\ncircumstances, I  consider this error an  alternative grounds\nfor reversal. \n    Furthermore, I cannot agree with the majority's cavalier\nconclusion  that  \"the  judge essentially  conducted  a full-\nfledged  inquiry when  he  asked the  other jurors  questions\nwhich  would have  revealed precisely  the impropriety  which\nJudge  Stahl fears.\"    Ante, at  16 n.2.   First  the record\n                           \ncontains  no such  \"full-fledged inquiry\";  and, second,  any\ninquiry  of  \"the  other  jurors\"  could  not  possibly  have\nrevealed  anything about  what Juror  Carrero did or  did not\nknow  about  the  putative  juror misconduct.    It  appears,\ntherefore, that the once  strict requirements of Richman have\n                                                       \nbeen relaxed to such an extent that a district court  now has\ndiscretion, according to the majority, to conduct essentially\nno inquiry at all.\n \n\n                            -35-\n                             35\n\nLouisiana, No. 92-5129, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">179275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (U.S.  June 1,\n        \n\n1993)  (quoting  Duncan  v,  Louisiana,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  155\n                                     \n\n(1968)).
