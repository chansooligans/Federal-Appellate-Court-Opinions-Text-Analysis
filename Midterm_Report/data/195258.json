In  this appeal,\n          BOWNES,  Senior  Circuit Judge.\n                                        \n\nClayton Libby, a Massachusetts  state prisoner serving a life\n\nsentence on a 1971 conviction for murder in the first degree,\n\nchallenges the district court's denial of his petition for  a\n\nwrit of  habeas corpus.   In  so doing,  petitioner primarily\n\ncontends  that the  court  erred in  deeming harmless  a jury\n\ninstruction   on  the  issue  of   malice  which  set  up  an\n\nunconstitutional mandatory  presumption.   See  Sandstrom  v.\n                                                         \n\nMontana, 442 U.S. 510, 520-24 (1979)  (instruction containing\n       \n\npresumption which has the effect of relieving the prosecution\n\nof  the burden  of proof  on an  element of  a charged  crime\n\nviolates  the  Due  Process Clause)  (hereinafter  \"Sandstrom\n                                                             \n\nerror\").1  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Early  in  the morning  of  August  9, 1970,  Bruce\n\nCullen, a New Hampshire  resident, was stabbed to death  in a\n\nbrawl that erupted outside of a South Boston housing project.\n\nPetitioner and George Cooper were indicted  and tried for the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Petitioner   also   argues   that   an   instruction   on\nmanslaughter   given    at   this   trial    effectuated   an\nunconstitutional  shift in the burden  of proof.   As we will\nexplain  more fully  infra in discussing  the effects  of the\n                          \npresumption-creating instruction, we do not believe it at all\nlikely  that  the  jury  would have  returned  a  verdict  of\nmanslaughter even if it  had been perfectly instructed.   We,\ntherefore, regard  any error in the  manslaughter instruction\nas harmless and confine  our discussion to petitioner's claim\nunder Sandstrom.\n               \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nkilling.  Cooper was acquitted; Libby, however, was convicted\n\nof murder in the first degree.\n\n          Although  the circumstances  in which  the stabbing\n\ntook place are sketchy, the trial record reveals that, on the\n\nnight  of  August  8,  1970, petitioner  was  drinking  beer,\n\nsmoking marijuana, and possibly  taking diet pills.  Sometime\n\nearly in  the morning  of August  9, 1970, petitioner,  along\n\nwith Francis Barton and Kevin Martin, went to George Cooper's\n\nSouth Boston  apartment building  and began to  converse with\n\nCooper  through  a rear  apartment  window.   After  a while,\n\npetitioner and  Martin walked  to the front  of the  building\n\nwhere they met several  other men.  Included among  these men\n\nwere the victim, Cullen,  and another New Hampshire resident,\n\nDennis Bates.\n\n          At some point, a  fight broke out.  The  reason for\n\nthe fight is not entirely clear, although there was testimony\n\nindicating that  it started  simply because Cullen  and Bates\n\nwere  not from the area.  There also was testimony indicating\n\nthat petitioner and Cullen  were arguing about whether Cullen\n\nhad been in a certain  federal prison.  In any event,  during\n\nthe  course of the fight, Cullen was stabbed nine times.  Six\n\nof the stab wounds were to his chest; the other three were to\n\nhis back  or  side.   One  of the  chest  wounds was  to  the\n\nvictim's heart, and apparently  was delivered by a \"downward\"\n\nblow.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          No  witness testified  to  actually  observing  the\n\nstabbing.2   Instead, petitioner  was inculpated  through the\n\ntestimony of  eyewitnesses who  observed him both  before and\n\nafter  the fight.   Specifically,  there was  testimony that,\n\ninter alia, petitioner (1) had been carrying a knife prior to\n          \n\nthe fight; (2)  was seen running  away from  the site of  the\n\nfight with blood on his clothes; (3) was seen holding a knife\n\nshortly  after  the   stabbing;  (4)  admitted,  on   several\n\noccasions after the fight, that he had done the stabbing; and\n\n(5) made threats against anyone who  might \"snitch[] on him.\"\n\nThere also  was testimony that petitioner  had stabbed Cullen\n\nbecause he thought Cullen was \"going to jump him from behind\"\n\nand/or  because  he  thought  Cullen was  \"beating  up  Kevin\n\nMartin.\"\n\n          At the  conclusion of  a seven-day jury  trial, the\n\ntrial  judge instructed the jury  on theories of first degree\n\nmurder,3  second degree  murder,  and manslaughter.   In  the\n\n                    \n\n2.  One witness,  Mary VanGordon, who lived  in a neighboring\napartment, did testify to seeing Cooper hold the victim while\na  short, stocky man with  dark hair (a  description that did\nnot fit petitioner) thrust an object towards Cullen's stomach\nfive  times.   VanGordon  further testified  that, after  the\nattack,  Cooper ran  into the  hallway of  a  nearby building\nwhile  the man  who had  thrust the  object towards  Cullen's\nstomach ran around to the back of the same building.\n\n3.  The trial court instructed the jury that it could convict\nfor  first  degree  murder  if  it  determined,  after  other\nrequisite  findings,  that  the  stabbing  had   been  either\ndeliberately premeditated or had  been committed with extreme\natrocity  or cruelty.  A review of the trial record, however,\nreveals  that  the  prosecution  relied  exclusively  on  the\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncourse  of defining  malice, which  is \"the  requisite mental\n\nelement\" of murder under Massachusetts law,  see Commonwealth\n                                                             \n\nv. Huot, 403 N.E.2d 411, 414 (Mass. 1980), overruled on other\n                                                             \n\ngrounds, Commonwealth v. Bray,  553 N.E.2d 538 (Mass. 1990),4\n                             \n\nthe  judge told the jury  that \"[m]alice is  implied in every\n\ndeliberate  cruel act  by  one against  another.\"   The  jury\n\nconvicted petitioner of first degree murder and recommended a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment.\n\n          On appeal, petitioner argued, inter alia,  that the\n                                                  \n\naforementioned  instruction  constituted Sandstrom  error and\n                                                  \n\nrequired reversal  of his  conviction.5   More  particularly,\n\n                    \n\nextreme  atrocity or  cruelty  theory in  arguing that  first\ndegree murder had been committed.\n\n4.  Unlawful killings committed without malice are considered\nmanslaughter.  See Commonwealth v.  Todd, 563 N.E.2d 211, 214\n                                        \n(Mass. 1990).  \n\n5.  Sandstrom  was  not  decided  until   eight  years  after\n             \npetitioner's  conviction.    However,   because  petitioner's\ndirect appeal  was not perfected until  nearly eighteen years\nafter his  conviction, see Commonwealth v.  Libby, 580 N.E.2d\n                                                 \n1025,   1026-27   (Mass.  1991)   (hereinafter   \"Libby  II\")\n                                                           \n(explaining  the  neglect  by  court-appointed  counsel,  the\nclerk's office, and the prosecutor's  office which led to the\ndelay  in  perfecting petitioner's  appeal), and  because new\nrules  announced  in Supreme  Court  decisions  apply to  all\ncriminal cases \"pending  on direct review or not  yet final,\"\nGriffith  v. Kentucky,  479 U.S.  314, 328  (1987),  both the\n                     \nMassachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court  (\"SJC\"), at  least in\nLibby  II,    and  the district  court  treated  petitioner's\n         \nSandstrom argument  as properly  raised  on direct  appellate\n         \nreview.  We will do likewise.\n          Similarly,  although petitioner  did not  object to\nthe  challenged  instruction  at   the  time  it  was  given,\nMassachusetts has  waived its contemporaneous  objection rule\nin the Sandstrom error context where the error occurred prior\n                \nto the Sandstrom  decision.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hill,\n                                                            \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\npetitioner asserted  that the  instruction had the  effect of\n\ndirecting the jury to find malice if it found that petitioner\n\nhad  committed a  \"deliberate cruel\"  act against  the victim\n\ndespite  the  fact  that  a  \"deliberate  cruel\"  act  is not\n\nnecessarily malicious.  The SJC  disagreed, holding:  \"In the\n\ncontext of the facts of this case and in light of the judge's\n\nentire  instruction   on  malice  (which  is   not  otherwise\n\nchallenged),  we see  neither a  substantial likelihood  of a\n\nmiscarriage  of justice  calling  for relief  .  . .  nor  an\n\nunconstitutional   presumption   dictated   to   the   jury.\"\n\nCommonwealth  v.  Libby, 540  N.E.2d  154,  158 (Mass.  1989)\n                       \n\n(hereinafter \"Libby I\").  The SJC then went on  to affirm the\n                     \n\nconviction, although  it remanded  to the superior  court for\n\nconsideration  of a  previously-filed motion  to dismiss  the\n\nindictment on account of delay.\n\n          In August 1990, petitioner's motion to  dismiss was\n\ndenied by the superior court.  In  September 1990, petitioner\n\n                    \n\n442 N.E.2d 24, 28  n.9 (Mass. 1982), vacated and  remanded on\n                                                             \nother grounds, Hill v. Maloney, 927 F.2d 646 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                              \nBecause this condition is met, petitioner's failure to object\nat  trial does  not procedurally  bar  us, see  Wainwright v.\n                                                          \nSykes, 433 U.S. 72, 84 (1977) (failure  to object at trial as\n     \nrequired   by   a   state  contemporaneous   objection   rule\nconstitutes  \"independent and adequate  ground\" sufficient to\nforeclose federal  habeas  review  of  alleged  error),  from\nreaching  the merits  of his  argument in this  instance, cf.\n                                                             \nPuleio  v.  Vose,  830  F.2d   1197,  1199  (1st  Cir.  1987)\n                \n(indicating  that waiver  of state  contemporaneous objection\nrule removes  procedural bar  that ordinarily  would preclude\nhabeas court from reaching claim on merits where there was no\nobjection at trial), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 990 (1988).      \n                                 \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal from this denial.  While that\n\nappeal  was pending, this  court handed down  its decision in\n\nHill v.  Maloney, 927 F.2d  646 (1st  Cir. 1990).   See supra\n                                                             \n\nnote 5.  In Hill, we held unconstitutional a jury instruction\n                \n\nquite  similar to  the one  here at  issue.  Id.  at 649-51.6\n                                                \n\nRelying on Hill, petitioner  argued for a second time  to the\n               \n\nSJC that his conviction should be set aside because the trial\n\njudge's  instruction   had  the  effect  of   setting  up  an\n\nunconstitutional mandatory presumption.  Once again,  the SJC\n\nrejected petitioner's argument  and affirmed his  conviction.\n\nSee Libby II, 580 N.E.2d at 1028.\n            \n\n          Finally, petitioner  sought relief in  the district\n\ncourt  by  means  of  a   writ  of  habeas  corpus.     In  a\n\ncomprehensive  memorandum and  order, the  court applied  the\n\nthree-part  test set  forth  in Hill  for  review of  alleged\n                                    \n\nSandstrom  errors  and denied  the  writ.   First,  the court\n         \n\ndetermined  that   the  challenged  instruction   set  up  an\n\nunconstitutional   mandatory    presumption   and   therefore\n\nconstituted Sandstrom error.   See  Libby v.  Duval, No.  86-\n                                                   \n\n2187-WD,  slip  op.   at  8-9  (D.  Mass.  April   20,  1993)\n\n(hereinafter \"Libby III\"); see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 648-49.\n                                        \n\nNext,  the court found that  the instructions as  a whole did\n\nnot sufficiently explain the erroneous instruction on malice,\n\n                    \n\n6.  In Hill, the jury was instructed that \"malice  is implied\n           \nfrom  any deliberate  or cruel  act against  another, however\n                        \nsudden.\"  Id. at 648 (emphasis added).\n             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nand the jury  therefore was  not properly  instructed on  the\n\nlaw.   See Libby III, slip  op. at 10-13; see  also Hill, 927\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at  649.    Finally,   the  court  concluded  that  the\n\ninstruction,   although  erroneous,  was  harmless  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.  See Libby III, slip op. at 13-19; see also\n                                                             \n\nHill, 927 F.2d at 649.   It is from this last conclusion that\n    \n\npetitioner appeals.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          We  agree   with  the  district   court  that   the\n\ntripartite Hill  test applies  to the merits  of petitioner's\n               \n\nclaim.   Accordingly, we  organize our discussion  within the\n\nHill framework.\n    \n\n                              A.\n\n          Because the Hill opinion rehearses  in great detail\n                          \n\nthe   legal  standards  applicable   to  challenges  to  jury\n\ninstructions  which   set   up  presumptions,   and   because\n\nrespondents7  concede that  the  instruction challenged  here\n\nestablished a  mandatory presumption, we do  not believe that\n\neither   a  highly   detailed  discussion   of  the   law  of\n\npresumptions  or   an  extensive   explanation  of   why  the\n\n                    \n\n7.

Thus, because the  instruction had\n\nthe  effect  of relieving  the prosecution  of the  burden of\n\nproof  on an element of the crime charged, see Sandstrom, 442\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  at 520-24,  the  district court's  conclusion that  the\n\ninstruction established a  mandatory presumption was  clearly\n\ncorrect.  Accordingly, we move to step two of the Hill test.\n                                                      \n\n                              B.\n\n          Once we have determined that the  specific language\n\nchallenged by a petitioner set up a mandatory presumption, we\n\nconsider whether other parts of the instruction explained the\n\nparticular infirm language  to the  extent that  there is  no\n\nreasonable   likelihood   that   the   jurors   applied   the\n\nunconstitutional presumption.   See Boyde v.  California, 494\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  370, 380  (1990).

After  reviewing these four  sections, and\n\nafter  further  reviewing the  instructions  as  a whole,  we\n\ncannot agree.\n\n          The  first  two  sections  adduced  by  respondents\n\ninvolve   definitions   of   malice   given   prior   to  the\n\n                    \n\n9.  This is  because \"`[t]he jury could  have interpreted the\ntwo sets  of instructions as indicating  that the presumption\nwas a means by  which proof beyond  a reasonable doubt as  to\n[malice] could  be satisfied.'\"  Id.

Cf.  id. at  653.   We  do not,\n                                      \n\nhowever, see  how these  definitions could have  explained to\n                                                          \n\nthe jurors  that the  upcoming instruction was  not going  to\n\nmean what  it actually and  clearly stated.  At  any rate, we\n\nreiterate   that   correct   instructions,   which   directly\n\ncontradict the  erroneous instruction, are not  sufficient to\n\ncure the error.  See supra at p.10 and note 10.\n                          \n\n          The other  two  sections cited  by respondents  are\n\nless  compelling.    The  first  of  these two,  which  again\n\npreceded  the infirm instruction, primarily defined the terms\n\n                    \n\n11.  The first  passage relied  upon by respondents  reads as\nfollows:  \"[M]urder is  the killing of a human  being without\nlegal  justification  or  without  excuse  or  without   such\nextenuating  circumstances   as  may  reduce  the   crime  to\nmanslaughter; but with what is called in the law, malice \naforethought.\"\n          The  second   passage  is   very  similar:     \"Any\nintentional  killing   of   a  human   being  without   legal\njustification   or    excuse   and   with    no   extenuating\ncircumstances,  sufficient  in law  to  reduce  the crime  to\nmanslaughter, is malicious.\"\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n\"aforethought\" and  \"murder.\"12  The second  defined the term\n\n\"premeditated.\"13\n\nBoth of  the passages  are jumbled and  confusing, especially\n\nwhen compared  to the  short  and relatively  straightforward\n\nstatement   which  set  up   the  unconstitutional  mandatory\n\npresumption.    Cf.  Hill,   927  F.2d  at  652  (juxtaposing\n                         \n\nclumsily-worded  correct instruction  with clear  and concise\n\nunconstitutional   instruction   in  deciding   that  correct\n\nportions of charge as a  whole did not negate the effects  of\n\nthe  presumption-creating  language).     Moreover,   neither\n\npassage explicitly  touched on the concept  of malice, except\n\n                    \n\n12.  In its entirety, this section reads:\n\n          If the  wicked  intent to  do  injury  to\n          another person precedes  the act by which\n          the   injury  was  done,   it  is  malice\n          aforethought.      If  the   homicide  is\n          committed without  legal justification or\n          that is to say, without  due authority of\n          law and not in self defense, and there is\n          no issue here of self defense, nor in the\n          heat of passion on great provocation, but\n          with the specific intent to take the  one\n          killed, or  an unlawful act,  the natural\n          consequence of which would be  to deprive\n          another person of life, it is murder.\n\n13.  This passage states:\n\n          Because it  was a  cruel act of  the will\n          and  unlike  an  intent  stimulated  by a\n          sudden  anger  or  quarrel where  someone\n          suddenly,  not  having intended  violence\n          beforehand, does.   It  must have been  a\n          design  actually  formed and  formed upon\n          before the  act and the murder  must have\n          been committed pursuant to design or plan\n          that has thus been formed.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\ninsofar as the first one briefly discussed the \"aforethought\"\n\ncomponent of  the term  \"malice aforethought.\"   In light  of\n\nthese deficiencies,  we do not  see how these  passages could\n\nhave actually explained the  challenged instruction \"so as to\n\noffset any erroneous impression  given by [it].\"  See  id. at\n                                                          \n\n651.\n\n          Before   concluding  our  analysis  of  the  entire\n\ncharge,  we  pause to  note that,  because  it was  framed in\n\nirrefutable and  unvarying  terms (\"[m]alice  is  implied  in\n                                                \n\nevery deliberate and cruel  act by one against  another\"), we\n     \n\nthink  it  at least  reasonably  likely  that the  challenged\n\ninstruction completely removed the element of malice from the\n\ncase once  the Commonwealth  established that  petitioner had\n\nacted deliberately  and cruelly.14  Therefore,  in conducting\n\nour harmless-error analysis,  we will regard the  instruction\n\nas having  erected a  conclusive mandatory presumption.   See\n                                                             \n\nHill, 927 F.2d at  649 n.3 (distinguishing between conclusive\n    \n\nmandatory     presumptions    and     rebuttable    mandatory\n\npresumptions).\n\n                    \n\n14.  We concede, as noted earlier, that the jurors might have\n                                                        \ninferred  from the  correct  definitions of  malice that  the\n\"implication\" of malice created  by deliberate and cruel acts\nwas rebuttable.   See supra at  p.11.  Such a  reading would,\n                           \nhowever, have been quite strained.  In any  case, we think it\nat least as likely that the jurors ignored the correct malice\ninstructions  which  are  facially  irreconcilable  with  the\nchallenged instruction.  See supra note 10.\n                                  \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          In sum, we agree  with the district court  that the\n\ncharge  as a  whole  did not  neutralize  the effect  of  the\n\npresumption-creating  language.   Accordingly, the  effect of\n\nthe instruction here was unconstitutional. \n\n                              C.\n\n          Having determined  that the overall charge  did not\n\nadequately explain the challenged  instruction, we still must\n\nascertain  whether the error was  harmless.  See  id. at 654;\n                                                     \n\nsee  also Sullivan v. Louisiana, 113 S.

In  Hill, because the Supreme Court  had sent\n                        \n\nmixed signals regarding the proper harmless-error analysis to\n\nbe employed where there has been a mandatory presumption,  we\n\napplied two  separate approaches.   First,  we looked  at the\n\ntrial record as  a whole  to determine whether  it was  clear\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the error was harmless.  See\n                                                             \n\nHill,  927 F.2d at  655 (applying the  Chapman v.

Pointing  to  (1) the  state's\n\ninterest in finality of convictions that have survived direct\n\nreview within the  state court system;  (2) the interests  of\n\ncomity; (3) the interests of federalism; and (4) the interest\n\nof maintaining the prominence of the trial itself,  the Court\n\ndecided  that application  of the  Chapman standard  to trial\n                                          \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nerrors  challenged on habeas resulted in an \"imbalance of . .\n\n. costs  and benefits.\"  Id. at 1721.  Accordingly, the Court\n                            \n\nembraced the less onerous Kotteakos standard, holding that it\n                                   \n\napplies \"in determining whether habeas relief must be granted\n\nbecause of constitutional error  of the trial type.\"   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n1722.  Like the Chapman test, this \"actual prejudice\" inquiry\n                       \n\npresumes   that  the   reviewing  court   will  conduct   its\n\nharmlessness assessment \"in light of the record  as a whole.\"\n\nId.\n   \n\n          After  Brecht,  we  think  it  apparent  that   the\n                       \n\nquestion of whether to apply the Kotteakos test in conducting\n                                          \n\nour harmless  error inquiry  turns on whether  the conclusive\n\npresumption here at issue constitutes \"trial error.\"  Despite\n\nthe force of  some of our dissenting  brother's arguments, we\n\nare  constrained  by the  Supreme  Court's  teaching that  it\n\nshould be so considered.  See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n279, 306-07  (1990)  (citing Carella).   Thus,  we train  our\n                                    \n\nsights on  whether, in light of the whole record, respondents\n\nhave   met   their   burden15  of   demonstrating   that  the\n\n                    \n\n15.  We  acknowledge  that  the  majority  opinion in  Brecht\n                                                             \ntreats the burden as petitioner's.  See Brecht, 113 S. Ct. at\n                                              \n1722.   Nonetheless,  as  Justice Stevens,  who provided  the\ncrucial fifth  vote in  Brecht, convincingly explains  in his\n                              \nconcurring  opinion,  the Kotteakos  test  requires that  the\n                                   \nparty  arguing the  harmlessness of  an error which  tends to\nprejudice  a   litigant's   \"substantial  rights\"   (as   all\nconstitutional  errors surely  do)  must bear  the burden  of\nproof.   Id. at 1723-24  and n.1  (Stevens, J.,  concurring).\n            \nGiven this authority,  and given the further fact  that there\nappear to be five votes for this position and only four votes\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nconclusive  presumption did not actually prejudice petitioner\n\nbecause it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or\n\ninfluence in  determining the jury's  verdict.  In  our view,\n\nrespondents have met their burden.\n\n          The thrust of petitioner's harmfulness claim is not\n\nthat, in the absence of the conclusive presumption,  he would\n\nhave been  acquitted.  Rather, petitioner's  argument is that\n\nthe conclusive presumption precluded the jury from convicting\n\nhim  of manslaughter  on a  theory of  \"sudden combat.\"   See\n                                                             \n\nCommonwealth  v. Richard,  384 N.E.2d  636, 638  (Mass. 1979)\n                        \n\n(the presence  of  sudden  combat  constitutes  a  mitigating\n\ncircumstance  sufficient to  reduce  a verdict  of murder  to\n\nmanslaughter under Massachusetts law).   While we concede (1)\n\nthat there was evidence  (i.e., the testimony that petitioner\n                              \n\nstabbed  Cullen because he thought Cullen  was \"going to jump\n\nhim  from  behind\"  and/or  because  he  thought  Cullen  was\n\n\"beating  up  Kevin  Martin\")  which  might  conceivably have\n                                           \n\nprovided  a basis  for the  jury to  have concluded  that the\n\ngovernment had not  proved an absence  of sudden combat;  and\n\n(2)  that the conclusive presumption tended to deter the jury\n\nfrom considering this evidence, see Yates, 111 S. Ct. at 1894\n                                         \n\nn.10  (conclusive  presumptions tend  to  deter  a jury  from\n\nconsidering  any evidence  for the  presumed fact  beyond the\n\n                    \n\nfor  placing the  burden on  petitioner,  we will  regard the\nburden of proof as resting upon the respondents.\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\npredicate evidence), we think  it extremely unlikely that the\n\njury  would  have relied  on  this  evidence  and returned  a\n\nverdict of  manslaughter.  Mary VanGordon  testified that the\n\nstabbing was administered while the victim was being held  by\n\nanother man.  Moreover, the  evidence reveals that the victim\n\nwas stabbed nine  times, with  six of the  stab wounds  being\n                \n\ndelivered to the  chest area.   In our  view, such  evidence,\n\nwhen  combined   with  the   fact  that  the   defense  never\n\nspecifically  argued a  sudden combat  theory to  the jury,16\n\nstrongly undermines any claim that petitioner was, throughout\n\nthe  entirety of the  stabbing, acting in  response to sudden\n\ncombat.\n\n          We do  not believe  that the  erroneous instruction\n\nhad a  substantial and injurious  effect or influence  on the\n\njury's verdict.  Accordingly,  we affirm the district court's\n\nconclusion that the instructional error was harmless.17\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n          CYR, Circuit  Judge (concurring):  Although I share\n          CYR, Circuit  Judge (concurring):\n                             \n\nmy dissenting  brother's belief that the  Carella concurrence\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n16.  It is clear from the record that  petitioner focused his\ndefense  efforts  on arguing  that  the  prosecution did  not\nestablish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was, in fact, the\nstabber.\n\n17.  In so ruling, we  express no opinion as to  the district\ncourt's  conclusion that  the  error here  was harmless  even\nunder the Chapman standard.\n                 \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\narticulates  compelling grounds  for more  narrowly confining\n\n\"harmless  error\" review  of a  jury instruction  mandating a\n\nconclusive presumption, I join the majority opinion because I\n\nam  satisfied that the review required by the Court in Brecht\n                                                             \n\nencompasses the entire record.\n\n          Dissent follows.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          Stahl, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  I agree with the\n                              \n\nmajority that the instruction  challenged here had the effect\n\nof  setting  up  a   conclusive  presumption  which  was  not\n\nexplained  away by  the totality  of the  charge.   I further\n\nagree  with  the  majority that  conclusive  presumptions can\n\nconstitute harmless error.  However, I cannot agree  with the\n\nmethod of  harmless-error analysis  employed by  the majority\n\nand   with  its  conclusion   that  the  presumption-creating\n\ninstruction  was  harmless.     Accordingly,  I  respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n                              A.\n                                \n\n          In concluding that it  is \"extremely unlikely  that\n\nthe  jury  would  have  relied on  [the  unconsidered  sudden\n\ncombat] evidence and returned a verdict of manslaughter,\" see\n                                                             \n\nante at  19, the majority significantly  expands the contours\n    \n\nof harmless-error  analysis.  For, implicit  in this facially\n\nuncontroversial statement  are two radical  assumptions:  (1)\n\nthat, in the habeas context, reviewing courts now are obliged\n\nto  supply  missing factual  findings; and  (2) that,  in the\n\nhabeas  context, reviewing  courts can  and should  rely upon\n\nevidence  that the  jury did  not consider.   In  my opinion,\n\nneither  assumption  can be  squared  with  settled authority\n\ninterpreting the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right and the Due\n\nProcess Clause.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          As  the Supreme Court has made clear in a series of\n\nrecent  decisions,  an  instruction  setting  up a  mandatory\n\npresumption engenders  an error different in  nature than the\n\nmore typical  form  of  constitutional  error  --  improperly\n\nadmitted  evidence  and/or  improperly allowed  argument.   A\n\nmandatory presumption directs the  jury to presume an element\n\nof  the crime  charged  upon finding  only certain  predicate\n\nfacts.   See, e.g.,  Sandstrom, 442  U.S. at  517.  This,  of\n                              \n\ncourse, directly violates a criminal defendant's  due process\n\nrights  to  have the  prosecution prove  all elements  of the\n\noffense  charged, see Sullivan v.

It also,  in my  view, tends  to\n\nundermine  the  Sixth  Amendment   jury-trial  right.

What is does mean,\n\nhowever,  as Justice Scalia  convincingly demonstrates in his\n\nconcurrence in Carella, is that \"the harmless-error  analysis\n                      \n\napplicable in assessing a mandatory conclusive presumption is\n\nwholly unlike the  typical form  of such analysis.\"   Id.  at\n                                                         \n\n267.

Rather, the test  instructs reviewing courts  to\n\nask  (1)  whether the  instruction  established  a conclusive\n\npresumption on  a charge which  did not affect  other charges\n\nand on which  the defendant  was acquitted;  (2) whether  the\n\ninstruction established a conclusive presumption with respect\n\nto an element of  the crime which the defendant  admitted; or\n\n(3) whether \n\n          the  predicate facts  relied upon  in the\n          instruction,  or other  facts necessarily\n          found by the jury, are so closely related\n          to the  ultimate fact to be presumed that\n          no rational jury  could find those  facts\n          without also finding that  ultimate fact,\n          making those  findings [the] functional[]\n          equivalent to . .  . the element required\n          to be presumed.\n\nId. at 271.

Obviously,  the most  potent  of these\n                   \n\narguments  is the one relied upon by  the majority:  that the\n\nwhole-record Brecht analysis applies to \"trial  errors,\" that\n                   \n\nthe  Supreme  Court,  in  a string  citation  in  Fulminante,\n                                                            \n\nindicated that a conclusive presumption is \"trial error,\" and\n\nthat  we therefore  are obliged  to conduct  our harmlessness\n\nreview in light of the whole record.\n\n          I will admit that the Court's characterization of a\n\nconclusive  presumption  as \"trial  error\"  in  Fulminante is\n                                                          \n\ntroublesome;  indeed,  I  think  this  case well  illustrates\n\nJustice  White's criticism  of the  \"trial error\"/\"structural\n\nerror\" dichotomy.

Applying a whole-\n\nrecord review not only ignores the considerations outlined in\n\nPart  A. of this dissent, but it also ignores two indications\n\nby Supreme  Court majorities, subsequent to  Fulminante, that\n                                                       \n\nthe Carella analysis is properly employed by courts reviewing\n           \n\npresumptions.  See Sullivan, 113 S.

One  might argue that  Yates has\n                                                         \n\nbeen superseded by Brecht, and that Brecht did not control in\n                                          \n\nSullivan  because Sullivan  was  a direct  review  case.   In\n                          \n\nresponse,  I would point out that  Chapman, which did control\n                                          \n\nin  Yates and would have controlled in Sullivan had the error\n                                               \n\ntherein  been  deemed  amenable  to   harmless-error  review,\n\ncontemplates  a  whole-record review  every  bit  as much  as\n\nBrecht does; nonetheless,  the Court  has made  clear in  the\n      \n\nChapman context that, when confronted with presumption error,\n       \n\nthe  typical form  of whole-record  analysis does  not apply.\n\nThus, I  read the  string  citation in  Fulminante as  merely\n                                                  \n\nindicating  that  a  conclusive presumption  is  amenable  to\n\nharmless-error review.  I do not read it as stating that such\n                                \n\na presumption is subject  to the usual whole-record harmless-\n\nerror test applicable to most other forms of trial error.\n\n          It  might  also be  argued  that  the Carella  test\n                                                       \n\nderives from Chapman, see  Carella, 491 U.S. at  271 (Scalia,\n                                  \n\nJ.,  concurring) (noting  that if  the  Carella test  is met,\n                                               \n\n\"[t]he error is  harmless because it is  `beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt' that the jury found the facts necessary to support the\n\nconviction\") (citing Chapman,  386 U.S. at 24),  and that the\n                            \n\nreplacement  of Chapman with Brecht on  habeas means that the\n                                   \n\nCarella concurrence  has no  relevance in  habeas cases.   In\n       \n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nresponse,  I  would  concede that  the  Carella  test can  be\n                                                             \n\ntheoretically viewed as \"deriving from\" Chapman.  In my view,\n                                               \n\nhowever,  the  Carella concurrence  can  just  as easily  and\n                      \n\nfairly  be   read  as   (1)  explaining  that   a  conclusive\n\npresumption  sets up  an  error which  tends  to undermine  a\n\nstructural guarantee  of the Constitution and  which only can\n\nbe  harmless   in  those   \"rare\"  circumstances   where  the\n\npresumption  did not play  \"any role\" in  the jury's verdict;\n\n(2) setting  forth the test for determining whether the error\n\nplayed  any  such role;  and  (3) noting,  in  conclusion and\n\nwithout  prior reference  to Chapman,  that when  the Carella\n                                                             \n\ntest is met, the Chapman test also is met.  In light of this,\n                        \n\nand because abandoning Carella necessarily means that we must\n                              \n\nwelcome factfinding by habeas courts on the basis of evidence\n\nthe jury did not consider, I prefer the latter reading.\n\n          A  third  argument might  be  that,  in Yates,  the\n                                                       \n\nSupreme  Court has  already  ratified factfinding  by  habeas\n\ncourts.  My response to such an argument simply would be that\n\nI  agree.   As I  see it,  the Yates  test for  reviewing the\n                                    \n\neffects   of   rebuttable   mandatory   presumptions,   which\n\nimpermissibly shift the burden  of proof from the prosecution\n\nto  the  defendant,   does,  despite   the  Supreme   Court's\n\nindications to the contrary, reek of factfinding by reviewing\n\ncourts.  Cf. generally Yates, 111 S. Ct. at 1898 (Scalia, J.,\n                            \n\nconcurring  in judgment)  (explaining that,  when a  jury has\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nbeen directed to apply a rebuttable mandatory presumption, it\n\nhas  never found that  the prosecution proved  the element on\n\nwhich the presumption was erected beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\nHowever, as Justice Scalia notes in his Carella concurrence:\n                                               \n\n          It is one thing to say that the effect of\n          th[e]      erroneous      burden-shifting\n          [effectuated by a rebuttable presumption]\n          will   be   disregarded  if   the  record\n          developed  at   trial  establishes  guilt\n          beyond  a reasonable  doubt; it  is quite\n          another to say that the jury's failure to\n          make  any  factual  determination of  the\n                   \n          elemental fact -- because of a conclusive\n          presumption resting upon findings that do\n          not establish beyond  a reasonable  doubt\n          the elemental  fact -- will  be similarly\n          disregarded.\n\nCarella, 491  U.S. at 273 (Scalia,  J., concurring) (internal\n       \n\nquotation marks omitted) (arguing the particular propriety of\n\nthe  Carella test  to  the  conclusive presumption  context).\n            \n\nThus, I  do not think that  the Yates test can  and should be\n                                     \n\nread  as implicitly  endorsing  the type  of factfinding  the\n\nmajority engages in today.\n\n          Finally,  one  might  argue,  as  does  the  Brecht\n                                                             \n\nmajority, that wholesale use of the  Brecht test promotes the\n                                           \n\nprinciples of  restraint, often couched in  terms of \"comity\"\n\nand \"federalism,\" underlying the  Supreme Court's more recent\n\nhabeas  jurisprudence.   In response, I  could only  agree if\n\n\"restraint\" is defined solely in terms of state prisoners not\n\nbeing granted very many writs of habeas corpus.  For, I think\n\nit  obvious that factfinding on  the basis of record evidence\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\nthat the jury never considered cannot be cited as evidence of\n\njudicial  restraint.   So  too do  I  think it  obvious  that\n\nprinciples of comity and  federalism should never require the\n                                                 \n\ncontinued  incarceration  of a  state  prisoner  who was  not\n\nafforded his/her constitutional rights  to have an  impartial\n\njury make the requisite  factual and elemental determinations\n\nin his/her trial  just because a federal judge  or a panel of\n\nfederal  judges believe that  guilt is \"likely\"  spelt out by\n\nthe record.

To be specific, the stabbing here could have been\n\nboth deliberate  and cruel,  but administered in  response to\n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n\nsudden combat, of  which there  is evidence  in this  record.\n\nThus, I  cannot say  that, in this  instance, \"the  predicate\n\nfacts  relied  upon  in   the  instruction,  or  other  facts\n\nnecessarily  found by the jury, are so closely related to the\n\nultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find\n\nthose  facts  without  also   finding  that  ultimate  fact.\"\n\nCarella,  491  U.S. at  271.   Accordingly,  the error  had a\n       \n\n\"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining\n\nthe  jury's verdict.\"    The petition,  therefore, should  be\n\ngranted.19  \n\n                    \n\n19.  Even were I to employ the deferential standard of review\nthe majority utilizes, I could not join the majority opinion.\nAs  I have explained, the error committed here had the effect\nof  deterring the  jury from  considering evidence  of sudden\ncombat.   Yet,  there  was  an  abundance of  such  evidence;\nindeed,  it is undisputed that the stabbing took place in the\nmidst of a drunken melee.   In light of this, and in light of\nthe further fact  that the  Commonwealth bore  the burden  of\nproving  an  absence of  sudden  combat  beyond a  reasonable\ndoubt, see Nieves, 476  N.E.2d at 182, I am at  a loss to see\n                 \nhow the error can be viewed as harmless even under Brecht.\n                                                         \n\n                             -33-\n                              33\n",

In so doing, petitioner primarily contends that the court erred in deeming harmless a jury instruction on the issue of malice which set up an unconstitutional mandatory presumption.  See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 520-24, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2451-59, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979) (instruction containing presumption which has the effect of relieving the prosecution of the burden of proof on an element of a charged crime violates the Due Process Clause) (hereinafter \"Sandstrom error\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the morning of August 9, 1970, Bruce Cullen, a New Hampshire resident, was stabbed to death in a brawl that erupted outside of a South Boston housing project.  Petitioner and George Cooper were indicted and tried for the killing.  Cooper was acquitted;  Libby, however, was convicted of murder in the first degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the circumstances in which the stabbing took place are sketchy, the trial record reveals that, on the night of August 8, 1970, petitioner was drinking beer, smoking marijuana, and possibly taking diet pills.  Sometime early in the morning of August 9, 1970, petitioner, along with Francis Barton and Kevin Martin, went to George Cooper's South Boston apartment building and began to converse with Cooper through a rear apartment window.  After a while, petitioner and Martin walked to the front of the building where they met several other men.  Included among these men were the victim, Cullen, and another New Hampshire resident, Dennis Bates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, a fight broke out.  The reason for the fight is not entirely clear, although there was testimony indicating that it started simply because Cullen and Bates were not from the area.  There also was testimony indicating that petitioner and Cullen were arguing about whether Cullen had been in a certain federal prison.  In any event, during the course of the fight, Cullen was stabbed nine times.  Six of the stab wounds were to his chest;  the other three were to his back or side.  One of the chest wounds was to the victim's heart, and apparently was delivered by a \"downward\" blow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No witness testified to actually observing the stabbing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Instead, petitioner was inculpated through the testimony of eyewitnesses who observed him both before and after the fight.  Specifically, there was testimony that, inter alia, petitioner (1) had been carrying a knife prior to the fight;  (2) was seen running away from the site of the fight with blood on his clothes;  (3) was seen holding a knife shortly after the stabbing;  (4) admitted, on several occasions after the fight, that he had done the stabbing;  and (5) made threats against anyone who might \"snitch[ ] on him.\"   There also was testimony that petitioner had stabbed Cullen because he thought Cullen was \"going to jump him from behind\" and/or because he thought Cullen was \"beating up Kevin Martin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of a seven-day jury trial, the trial judge instructed the jury on theories of first degree murder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> second degree murder, and manslaughter.  In the course of defining malice, which is \"the requisite mental element\" of murder under Massachusetts law, see Commonwealth v. Huot, 380 Mass. 403, 403 N.E.2d 411, 414 (1980), overruled on other grounds, Commonwealth v. Bray, 407 Mass. 296, 553 N.E.2d 538 (1990),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the judge told the jury that \"[m]alice is implied in every deliberate cruel act by one against another.\"   The jury convicted petitioner of first degree murder and recommended a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, petitioner argued, inter alia, that the aforementioned instruction constituted Sandstrom error and required reversal of his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  More particularly, petitioner asserted that the instruction had the effect of directing the jury to find malice if it found that petitioner had committed a \"deliberate cruel\" act against the victim despite the fact that a \"deliberate cruel\" act is not necessarily malicious.  The SJC disagreed, holding:  \"In the context of the facts of this case and in light of the judge's entire instruction on malice (which is not otherwise challenged), we see neither a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice calling for relief ... nor an unconstitutional presumption dictated to the jury.\"  Commonwealth v. Libby, 405 Mass. 231, 540 N.E.2d 154, 158 (1989) (hereinafter \"Libby I \").   The SJC then went on to affirm the conviction, although it remanded to the superior court for consideration of a previously-filed motion to dismiss the indictment on account of delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, petitioner's motion to dismiss was denied by the superior court.  In September 1990, petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal from this denial.  While that appeal was pending, this court handed down its decision in Hill v. Maloney, 927 F.2d 646 (1st Cir.1990).  See supra note 5.  In Hill, we held unconstitutional a jury instruction quite similar to the one here at issue.  Id. at 649-51.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Relying on Hill, petitioner argued for a second time to the SJC that his conviction should be set aside because the trial judge's instruction had the effect of setting up an unconstitutional mandatory presumption.  Once again, the SJC rejected petitioner's argument and affirmed his conviction.  See Libby II, 580 N.E.2d at 1028.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, petitioner sought relief in the district court by means of a writ of habeas corpus.  In a comprehensive memorandum and order, the court applied the three-part test set forth in Hill for review of alleged Sandstrom errors and denied the writ.  First, the court determined that the challenged instruction set up an unconstitutional mandatory presumption and therefore constituted Sandstrom error.  See Libby v. Duval, No. 86-2187-WD, slip op. at 8-9 (D.Mass. April 20, 1993) (hereinafter \"Libby III \");  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 648-49.   Next, the court found that the instructions as a whole did not sufficiently explain the erroneous instruction on malice, and the jury therefore was not properly instructed on the law.  See Libby III, slip op. at 10-13;  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 649.   Finally, the court concluded that the instruction, although erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Libby III, slip op. at 13-19;  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 649.   It is from this last conclusion that petitioner appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the tripartite Hill test applies to the merits of petitioner's claim.  Accordingly, we organize our discussion within the Hill framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Hill opinion rehearses in great detail the legal standards applicable to challenges to jury instructions which set up presumptions, and because respondents<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> concede that the instruction challenged here established a mandatory presumption, we do not believe that either a highly detailed discussion of the law of presumptions or an extensive explanation of why the instruction was defective is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Instead, we think it sufficient to note our belief that it was reasonably likely that the jurors construed the trial judge's instruction as requiring a finding of malice upon a finding that the stabbing was \"deliberate\" and \"cruel.\"   See Estelle v. McGuire, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (habeas challenges to jury instructions reviewed for \"reasonable likelihood\" that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in an unconstitutional manner).  Thus, because the instruction had the effect of relieving the prosecution of the burden of proof on an element of the crime charged, see Sandstrom, 442 U.S. at 520-24, 99 S.Ct. at 2457-59, the district court's conclusion that the instruction established a mandatory presumption was clearly correct.  Accordingly, we move to step two of the Hill test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once we have determined that the specific language challenged by a petitioner set up a mandatory presumption, we consider whether other parts of the instruction explained the particular infirm language to the extent that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jurors applied the unconstitutional presumption.  See Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990).  General instructions regarding the presumption of innocence and the government's burden of proving all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt are insufficient to fulfill this explanatory role.  Id. at 651.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  So too are instructions directly contrary to the erroneous one which themselves correctly state the law.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Instead, there must be other language in the instructions which actually \"explains the infirm language sufficiently so that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it must [in the context of an erroneous malice instruction] find malice if it found petitioner [acted in such a way so as to trigger the unconstitutional presumption].\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents contend that four sections of the instructions, when taken together, sufficiently explain the infirm language.  After reviewing these four sections, and after further reviewing the instructions as a whole, we cannot agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two sections adduced by respondents involve definitions of malice given prior to the unconstitutional instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  In each of these two instances, the trial judge correctly instructed the jurors that malice was not proved where, among other things, there were \"extenuating circumstances\" sufficient to \"reduce the crime to manslaughter.\"   At most, we think that these two definitions of malice might have allowed the jurors to infer that the presumption set up by the subsequent unconstitutional charge could be rebutted in certain extenuating circumstances.  Cf. id. at 653.   We do not, however, see how these definitions could have explained to the jurors that the upcoming instruction was not going to mean what it actually and clearly stated.  At any rate, we reiterate that correct instructions, which directly contradict the erroneous instruction, are not sufficient to cure the error.  See supra at p. 737 and note 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other two sections cited by respondents are less compelling.  The first of these two, which again preceded the infirm instruction, primarily defined the terms \"aforethought\" and \"murder.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The second defined the term \"premeditated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Both of the passages are jumbled and confusing, especially when compared to the short and relatively straightforward statement which set up the unconstitutional mandatory presumption.  Cf. Hill, 927 F.2d at 652 (juxtaposing clumsily-worded correct instruction with clear and concise unconstitutional instruction in deciding that correct portions of charge as a whole did not negate the effects of the presumption-creating language).  Moreover, neither passage explicitly touched on the concept of malice, except insofar as the first one briefly discussed the \"aforethought\" component of the term \"malice aforethought.\"   In light of these deficiencies, we do not see how these passages could have actually explained the challenged instruction \"so as to offset any erroneous impression given by [it].\"  See id. at 651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding our analysis of the entire charge, we pause to note that, because it was framed in irrefutable and unvarying terms (\"[m]alice is implied in every deliberate and cruel act by one against another\"), we think it at least reasonably likely that the challenged instruction completely removed the element of malice from the case once the Commonwealth established that petitioner had acted deliberately and cruelly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Therefore, in conducting our harmless-error analysis, we will regard the instruction as having erected a conclusive mandatory presumption.  See Hill, 927 F.2d at 649 n. 3 (distinguishing between conclusive mandatory presumptions and rebuttable mandatory presumptions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we agree with the district court that the charge as a whole did not neutralize the effect of the presumption-creating language.  Accordingly, the effect of the instruction here was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the overall charge did not adequately explain the challenged instruction, we still must ascertain whether the error was harmless.  See id. at 654;  see also Sullivan v. Louisiana, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2082, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (reiterating that Sandstrom error is subject to harmless-error review).  In Hill, because the Supreme Court had sent mixed signals regarding the proper harmless-error analysis to be employed where there has been a mandatory presumption, we applied two separate approaches.  First, we looked at the trial record as a whole to determine whether it was clear \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the error was harmless.  See Hill, 927 F.2d at 655 (applying the Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), standard for determining, on direct review, whether a conviction must be set aside because of federal constitutional error);  see also Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 580-82, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3107-08, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986) (applying Chapman harmless-error standard to a presumption-creating jury instruction challenged on habeas).  Alternatively, we utilized a narrower approach, derived from Chapman, for analyzing the effects of a conclusive mandatory presumption urged by Justice Scalia in a concurring opinion in Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263, 267-73, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 2421-24, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (hereinafter the \"Carella test\").  See Hill, 927 F.2d at 654-56.   Under both approaches we determined that the error was not harmless.  Id. at 657.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the decision in Hill, however, (and since the district court passed on whether or not the presumption-creating instruction was harmless), the Supreme Court has issued Brecht v. Abrahamson, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), which clarifies that the two approaches employed in Hill are no longer applicable on collateral review.  In Brecht, the Supreme Court announced that the Chapman \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" test should not be utilized by courts reviewing claims of constitutional error of the trial type on habeas, id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1717;  instead, reviewing courts should now look to whether error \" 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1722 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner contends that the Brecht approach is inappropriate in the conclusive presumption context.  He therefore urges us to explicitly adopt the Carella test for determining whether or not an instruction creating such a presumption can be viewed as harmless error.  In light of the clear and uncompromising language employed by the Court in Brecht, we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue presented in Brecht was whether the prosecutor's use of petitioner's post-Miranda silence for impeachment purposes at petitioner's trial, which violated petitioner's due process rights under Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (hereinafter \"Doyle error\"), was harmless.  In concluding that it was, the majority decided, as we have noted, that the Kotteakos harmless-error standard was the appropriate lens through which to view the claim on habeas.  See Brecht, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1722.   In so doing, the Court departed from the approach taken in certain other habeas cases where it had assumed the applicability of the Chapman standard.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1718 (citing Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. 391, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 114 L.Ed.2d 432 (1991);  Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986);  Milton v.

These are errors which \" 'occur[ ] during the presentation of the case to the jury,' and [are] amenable to harmless error analysis because [they] 'may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine the effect [they] had on the trial.' \"  Id. (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307-08, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1263-64, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)).  Errors of the trial type have, since Chapman, been reviewed under the \"harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court also noted that, at the other end of the spectrum of constitutional errors are \" 'structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards' ... because they infect the entire trial process.\"  Id. (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309, 111 S.Ct. at 1264).   Listed as an example of such a structural defect was deprivation of the right to counsel.  Id. (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reaching this conclusion, and determining that neither the doctrine of stare decisis nor congressional silence prevented it from considering the merits of respondent's argument that the Kotteakos standard, and not the Chapman standard, should be employed in determining whether the Doyle error was harmless, see generally id. --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1718-19, the Court turned to an analysis of whether the Chapman standard appropriately served certain interests implicated in habeas cases but not in the direct review context whence it sprang.  Pointing to (1) the state's interest in finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system;  (2) the interests of comity;  (3) the interests of federalism;  and (4) the interest of maintaining the prominence of the trial itself, the Court decided that application of the Chapman standard to trial errors challenged on habeas resulted in an \"imbalance of ... costs and benefits.\"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1721.   Accordingly, the Court embraced the less onerous Kotteakos standard, holding that it applies \"in determining whether habeas relief must be granted because of constitutional error of the trial type.\"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1722.   Like the Chapman test, this \"actual prejudice\" inquiry presumes that the reviewing court will conduct its harmlessness assessment \"in light of the record as a whole.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Brecht, we think it apparent that the question of whether to apply the Kotteakos test in conducting our harmless error inquiry turns on whether the conclusive presumption here at issue constitutes \"trial error.\"   Despite the force of some of our dissenting brother's arguments, we are constrained by the Supreme Court's teaching that it should be so considered.  See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306-07, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1261-62, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1990) (citing Carella ).   Thus, we train our sights on whether, in light of the whole record, respondents have met their burden<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> of demonstrating that the conclusive presumption did not actually prejudice petitioner because it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.

Rather, petitioner's argument is that the conclusive presumption precluded the jury from convicting him of manslaughter on a theory of \"sudden combat.\"   See Commonwealth v. Richard, 377 Mass. 64, 384 N.E.2d 636, 638 (1979) (the presence of sudden combat constitutes a mitigating circumstance sufficient to reduce a verdict of murder to manslaughter under Massachusetts law).  While we concede (1) that there was evidence (i.e., the testimony that petitioner stabbed Cullen because he thought Cullen was \"going to jump him from behind\" and/or because he thought Cullen was \"beating up Kevin Martin\") which might conceivably have provided a basis for the jury to have concluded that the government had not proved an absence of sudden combat;  and (2) that the conclusive presumption tended to deter the jury from considering this evidence, see Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n. 10, 111 S.Ct. at 1894 n. 10 (conclusive presumptions tend to deter a jury from considering any evidence for the presumed fact beyond the predicate evidence), we think it extremely unlikely that the jury would have relied on this evidence and returned a verdict of manslaughter.  Mary VanGordon testified that the stabbing was administered while the victim was being held by another man.  Moreover, the evidence reveals that the victim was stabbed nine times, with six of the stab wounds being delivered to the chest area.  In our view, such evidence, when combined with the fact that the defense never specifically argued a sudden combat theory to the jury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> strongly undermines any claim that petitioner was, throughout the entirety of the stabbing, acting in response to sudden combat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that the erroneous instruction had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's verdict.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that it is \"extremely unlikely that the jury would have relied on [the unconsidered sudden combat] evidence and returned a verdict of manslaughter,\" see ante at 740, the majority significantly expands the contours of harmless-error analysis.  For, implicit in this facially uncontroversial statement are two radical assumptions:  (1) that, in the habeas context, reviewing courts now are obliged to supply missing factual findings;  and (2) that, in the habeas context, reviewing courts can and should rely upon evidence that the jury did not consider.  In my opinion, neither assumption can be squared with settled authority interpreting the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right and the Due Process Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court has made clear in a series of recent decisions, an instruction setting up a mandatory presumption engenders an error different in nature than the more typical form of constitutional error--improperly admitted evidence and/or improperly allowed argument.  A mandatory presumption directs the jury to presume an element of the crime charged upon finding only certain predicate facts.  See, e.g., Sandstrom, 442 U.S. at 517, 99 S.Ct. at 2455.   This, of course, directly violates a criminal defendant's due process rights to have the prosecution prove all elements of the offense charged, see Sullivan v. Louisiana, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2080, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (citing Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 2327, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) and Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 795, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 1005, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952)), and to have the prosecution persuade the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements, id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2080-81 (citing In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) and Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100, 104, 93 S.Ct. 354, 357, 34 L.Ed.2d 335 (1972) (per curiam)).  It also, in my view, tends to undermine the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right.  See generally Carella, 491 U.S. at 268-69, 109 S.Ct. at 2422 (Scalia, J., concurring);  cf. Sullivan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2080 (discussing Sixth Amendment right to have the jury, and not the judge, make the requisite finding of guilt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conclusive mandatory presumption, as distinguished from a rebuttable mandatory presumption, has a further pernicious effect.  By directing, without the possibility of rebuttal, the jury to find the elemental fact merely upon finding certain predicate facts, it \"tend[s] to deter a jury from considering any evidence for the presumed fact beyond the predicate evidence.\"  Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n. 10, 111 S.Ct. at 1894 n. 10.   Indeed, given the \"sound presumption of appellate practice[ ] that jurors are reasonable and generally follow the instructions they are given,\" id. at 403, 111 S.Ct. at 1893, a reviewing court must assume that the jury did not consider evidence beyond that relating to the predicate facts, because \"to do so would be a waste of the jury's time and contrary to its instructions,\" id. at 406 n. 10, 1894 n. 10;  see also Carella, 491 U.S. at 269, 109 S.Ct. at 2422 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of this is not to say that a conclusive presumption can never be harmless error.  What it does mean, however, as Justice Scalia convincingly demonstrates in his concurrence in Carella, is that \"the harmless-error analysis applicable in assessing a mandatory conclusive presumption is wholly unlike the typical form of such analysis.\"  Id. at 267, 109 S.Ct. at 2421.   Whereas it makes sense in the case of the more typical form of constitutional error--improperly admitted evidence and/or improperly allowed argument--to perform the type of whole-record \"quantitative assessment\" outlined in Brecht (and, incidentally, also outlined in Chapman ) in order \"to determine whether the fact supported by [the] improperly admitted evidence [or improperly allowed argument] was in any event overwhelmingly established by other evidence,\" see id., such an inquiry makes no sense where the error is not that the jury may have been swayed by tainted information, but rather is that the jury failed to consider relevant evidence and failed to make a required finding, id. at 267-69, 109 S.Ct. at 2421.   For, as Justice Scalia explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>[Such] problem[s] would not be cured by an appellate court's determination that the record evidence unmistakably established guilt, for that would represent a finding of fact by judges, not by a jury.  As with a directed verdict [for the State, which is constitutionally impermissible, see United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 572-73 [97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355, 51 L.Ed.2d 642] (1977) ], \"the error in such a case is that the wrong entity judged the defendant guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 269, 109 S.Ct. at 2422 (quoting Rose v.

Thus, the proper question for the reviewing court \" 'is not whether guilt may be spelt out of a record, but whether guilt has been found by a jury according to the procedure and standards appropriate for criminal trials.' \"  Id. (quoting Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 614, 66 S.Ct. 402, 406, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, Justice Scalia has proposed a test for determining whether, despite the presence of a conclusive presumption, a particular case presents a \" 'rare situation[ ]' \" where \" '[a] reviewing court can be confident that [such a presumption] did not play any role in the jury's verdict.' \"  Id. 491 U.S. at 270, 109 S.Ct. at 2422 (quoting Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U.S. 73, 87, 103 S.Ct. 969, 977, 74 L.Ed.2d 823 (1983) (plurality opinion)).  Seeking to avoid the specter of factfinding by reviewing courts on the basis of evidence the jury never considered, the Carella test does not direct courts to ascertain whether the presumed fact was otherwise established to varying degrees by the evidence (as the Brecht and Chapman tests would do).  Rather, the test instructs reviewing courts to ask (1) whether the instruction established a conclusive presumption on a charge which did not affect other charges and on which the defendant was acquitted;  (2) whether the instruction established a conclusive presumption with respect to an element of the crime which the defendant admitted;  or (3) whether</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact, making those findings [the] functional[ ] equivalent to ... the element required to be presumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423.   If the answer to any of these three questions is \"yes,\" the error is harmless.  See id.   Because this test faithfully preserves a criminal defendant's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to have an impartial jury make the requisite factual and elemental determinations in his/her trial, and because it provides assurance that reviewing courts will consider only the evidence that the jury considered, I would apply this test rather than the ill-defined harmless-error test that the majority employs today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before applying the Carella test to this case, I feel it appropriate to respond to the arguments against the Carella test and in favor of the whole-record approach outlined in Brecht.   Obviously, the most potent of these arguments is the one relied upon by the majority:  that the whole-record Brecht analysis applies to \"trial errors,\" that the Supreme Court, in a string citation in Fulminante, indicated that a conclusive presumption is \"trial error,\" and that we therefore are obliged to conduct our harmlessness review in light of the whole record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will admit that the Court's characterization of a conclusive presumption as \"trial error\" in Fulminante is troublesome;  indeed, I think this case well illustrates Justice White's criticism of the \"trial error\"/\"structural error\" dichotomy.  See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 291, 111 S.Ct. at 291 (White, J., dissenting in part) (arguing that, in assessing whether harmless-error analysis ought to be applied, courts should disregard the trial error/structural error distinction and instead \"consider[ ] the nature of the right at issue and the effect of [the] error upon the trial\").  Despite the aforementioned indication to the contrary, the presence of a non-harmless (as determined by the Carella test) conclusive presumption strikes me as a type of \"structural error.\"   See Carella, 491 U.S. at 268, 109 S.Ct. at 2419 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"The constitutional right to a jury trial embodies a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.  It is a structural guarantee that reflects a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power--a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges.\")  (emphasis supplied) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  cf. Sullivan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2083 (denial of the right to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is a structural error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, however, whether we label a conclusive presumption trial error, structural error, or something in between is of no consequence;  what matters instead is that we apply the appropriate form of harmless-error review in assessing the effects of that presumption.  Applying a whole-record review not only ignores the considerations outlined in Part A. of this dissent, but it also ignores two indications by Supreme Court majorities, subsequent to Fulminante, that the Carella analysis is properly employed by courts reviewing presumptions.  See Sullivan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2082 (indicating, in the direct review context, that Carella provides the proper framework for determining whether or not a mandatory presumption was harmless);  Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n. 10, 111 S.Ct. at 1894 n. 10 (implicitly endorsing, in the habeas context, the Carella test as a means for evaluating whether or not a conclusive presumption was harmless).  One might argue that Yates has been superseded by Brecht, and that Brecht did not control in Sullivan because Sullivan was a direct review case.  In response, I would point out that Chapman, which did control in Yates and would have controlled in Sullivan had the error therein been deemed amenable to harmless-error review, contemplates a whole-record review every bit as much as Brecht does;  nonetheless, the Court has made clear in the Chapman context that, when confronted with presumption error, the typical form of whole-record analysis does not apply.  Thus, I read the string citation in Fulminante as merely indicating that a conclusive presumption is amenable to harmless-error review.  I do not read it as stating that such a presumption is subject to the usual whole-record harmless-error test applicable to most other forms of trial error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might also be argued that the Carella test derives from Chapman, see Carella, 491 U.S. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423 (Scalia, J., concurring) (noting that if the Carella test is met, \"[t]he error is harmless because it is 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that the jury found the facts necessary to support the conviction\") (citing Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828), and that the replacement of Chapman with Brecht on habeas means that the Carella concurrence has no relevance in habeas cases.  In response, I would concede that the Carella test can be theoretically viewed as \"deriving from\" Chapman.   In my view, however, the Carella concurrence can just as easily and fairly be read as (1) explaining that a conclusive presumption sets up an error which tends to undermine a structural guarantee of the Constitution and which only can be harmless in those \"rare\" circumstances where the presumption did not play \"any role\" in the jury's verdict;  (2) setting forth the test for determining whether the error played any such role;  and (3) noting, in conclusion and without prior reference to Chapman, that when the Carella test is met, the Chapman test also is met.  In light of this, and because abandoning Carella necessarily means that we must welcome factfinding by habeas courts on the basis of evidence the jury did not consider, I prefer the latter reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third argument might be that, in Yates, the Supreme Court has already ratified factfinding by habeas courts.  My response to such an argument simply would be that I agree.  As I see it, the Yates test for reviewing the effects of rebuttable mandatory presumptions, which impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant, does, despite the Supreme Court's indications to the contrary, reek of factfinding by reviewing courts.  Cf. generally Yates, 500 U.S. at 411, 111 S.Ct. at 1898 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that, when a jury has been directed to apply a rebuttable mandatory presumption, it has never found that the prosecution proved the element on which the presumption was erected beyond a reasonable doubt).  However, as Justice Scalia notes in his Carella concurrence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>It is one thing to say that the effect of th[e] erroneous burden-shifting [effectuated by a rebuttable presumption] will be disregarded if the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;  it is quite another to say that the jury's failure to make any factual determination of the elemental fact--because of a conclusive presumption resting upon findings that do not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the elemental fact--will be similarly disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carella, 491 U.S. at 273, 109 S.Ct. at 2424 (Scalia, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted) (arguing the particular propriety of the Carella test to the conclusive presumption context).  Thus, I do not think that the Yates test can and should be read as implicitly endorsing the type of factfinding the majority engages in today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one might argue, as does the Brecht majority, that wholesale use of the Brecht test promotes the principles of restraint, often couched in terms of \"comity\" and \"federalism,\" underlying the Supreme Court's more recent habeas jurisprudence.  In response, I could only agree if \"restraint\" is defined solely in terms of state prisoners not being granted very many writs of habeas corpus.  For, I think it obvious that factfinding on the basis of record evidence that the jury never considered cannot be cited as evidence of judicial restraint.  So too do I think it obvious that principles of comity and federalism should never require the continued incarceration of a state prisoner who was not afforded his/her constitutional rights to have an impartial jury make the requisite factual and elemental determinations in his/her trial just because a federal judge or a panel of federal judges believe that guilt is \"likely\" spelt out by the record.  Cf. Bollenbach, 326 U.S. at 614, 66 S.Ct. at 406.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of the Carella test to the case at bar easily yields the conclusion that the error here was not harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  I start from the premise that the question of whether an unlawful killing constitutes murder or manslaughter turns on whether or not the killing was committed with malice.  See ante note 4.  \"An intention to inflict injury on the victim which is not justified on any lawful ground or palliated by the existence of any mitigating circumstances is malicious within the meaning of the law.\"  Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz, 408 Mass. 533, 562 N.E.2d 797, 808 (1990) (emphasis supplied) (quoting Commonwealth v.

Commonwealth, 381 Mass. 398, 409 N.E.2d 764, 769 (1980) (malice and the presence of legal mitigation are \"mutually exclusive\").  The presence of \"sudden combat\" constitutes a mitigating circumstance sufficient to negate malice and to reduce a verdict of murder to manslaughter under Massachusetts law.  See Richard, 384 N.E.2d at 638;  cf. Commonwealth v. Nardone, 406 Mass. 123, 546 N.E.2d 359, 364 (1989) (distinguishing between assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to kill).  And, when such a mitigating circumstance is adequately raised in the evidence (as sudden combat was here), the Commonwealth must prove the absence of this circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Commonwealth v. Nieves, 394 Mass. 355, 476 N.E.2d 179, 182 (1985) (citing Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 697-98, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1888-89, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) and Commonwealth v.

The foregoing authority, however, makes clear that deliberate and cruel behavior is not necessarily tantamount to malicious behavior.  To be specific, the stabbing here could have been both deliberate and cruel, but administered in response to sudden combat, of which there is evidence in this record.  Thus, I cannot say that, in this instance, \"the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact.\"  Carella, 491 U.S. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423.

Nonetheless, as Justice Stevens, who provided the crucial fifth vote in Brecht, convincingly explains in his concurring opinion, the Kotteakos test requires that the party arguing the harmlessness of an error which tends to prejudice a litigant's \"substantial rights\" (as all constitutional errors surely do) must bear the burden of proof.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1723-24 and n. 1 (Stevens, J., concurring).

Petitioner and George Cooper were indicted and tried for the killing.  Cooper was acquitted;  Libby, however, was convicted of murder in the first degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the circumstances in which the stabbing took place are sketchy, the trial record reveals that, on the night of August 8, 1970, petitioner was drinking beer, smoking marijuana, and possibly taking diet pills.  Sometime early in the morning of August 9, 1970, petitioner, along with Francis Barton and Kevin Martin, went to George Cooper's South Boston apartment building and began to converse with Cooper through a rear apartment window.  After a while, petitioner and Martin walked to the front of the building where they met several other men.  Included among these men were the victim, Cullen, and another New Hampshire resident, Dennis Bates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, a fight broke out.  The reason for the fight is not entirely clear, although there was testimony indicating that it started simply because Cullen and Bates were not from the area.  There also was testimony indicating that petitioner and Cullen were arguing about whether Cullen had been in a certain federal prison.  In any event, during the course of the fight, Cullen was stabbed nine times.  Six of the stab wounds were to his chest;  the other three were to his back or side.  One of the chest wounds was to the victim's heart, and apparently was delivered by a \"downward\" blow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No witness testified to actually observing the stabbing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Instead, petitioner was inculpated through the testimony of eyewitnesses who observed him both before and after the fight.  Specifically, there was testimony that, inter alia, petitioner (1) had been carrying a knife prior to the fight;  (2) was seen running away from the site of the fight with blood on his clothes;  (3) was seen holding a knife shortly after the stabbing;  (4) admitted, on several occasions after the fight, that he had done the stabbing;  and (5) made threats against anyone who might \"snitch[ ] on him.\"   There also was testimony that petitioner had stabbed Cullen because he thought Cullen was \"going to jump him from behind\" and/or because he thought Cullen was \"beating up Kevin Martin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of a seven-day jury trial, the trial judge instructed the jury on theories of first degree murder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> second degree murder, and manslaughter.

The SJC disagreed, holding:  \"In the context of the facts of this case and in light of the judge's entire instruction on malice (which is not otherwise challenged), we see neither a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice calling for relief ... nor an unconstitutional presumption dictated to the jury.\"  Commonwealth v. Libby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2181120\"><a href=\"/opinion/2181120/commonwealth-v-libby/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2181120\"><a href=\"/opinion/2181120/commonwealth-v-libby/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 158 (1989) (hereinafter \"Libby I \").   The SJC then went on to affirm the conviction, although it remanded to the superior court for consideration of a previously-filed motion to dismiss the indictment on account of delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, petitioner's motion to dismiss was denied by the superior court.  In September 1990, petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal from this denial.  While that appeal was pending, this court handed down its decision in Hill v. Maloney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557195\"><a href=\"/opinion/557195/gerald-m-hill-v-michael-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990).  See supra note 5.  In Hill, we held unconstitutional a jury instruction quite similar to the one here at issue.  Id. at 649-51.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Relying on Hill, petitioner argued for a second time to the SJC that his conviction should be set aside because the trial judge's instruction had the effect of setting up an unconstitutional mandatory presumption.  Once again, the SJC rejected petitioner's argument and affirmed his conviction.  See Libby II, 580 N.E.2d at 1028.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, petitioner sought relief in the district court by means of a writ of habeas corpus.  In a comprehensive memorandum and order, the court applied the three-part test set forth in Hill for review of alleged Sandstrom errors and denied the writ.  First, the court determined that the challenged instruction set up an unconstitutional mandatory presumption and therefore constituted Sandstrom error.  See Libby v. Duval, No. 86-2187-WD, slip op. at 8-9 (D.Mass. April 20, 1993) (hereinafter \"Libby III \");  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 648-49.   Next, the court found that the instructions as a whole did not sufficiently explain the erroneous instruction on malice, and the jury therefore was not properly instructed on the law.  See Libby III, slip op. at 10-13;  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 649.   Finally, the court concluded that the instruction, although erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Libby III, slip op. at 13-19;  see also Hill, 927 F.2d at 649.   It is from this last conclusion that petitioner appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the tripartite Hill test applies to the merits of petitioner's claim.

McGuire, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112660\"><a href=\"/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, because the instruction had the effect of relieving the prosecution of the burden of proof on an element of the crime charged, see Sandstrom, 442 U.S. at 520-24, 99 S.Ct. at 2457-59, the district court's conclusion that the instruction established a mandatory presumption was clearly correct.  Accordingly, we move to step two of the Hill test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once we have determined that the specific language challenged by a petitioner set up a mandatory presumption, we consider whether other parts of the instruction explained the particular infirm language to the extent that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jurors applied the unconstitutional presumption.  See Boyde v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 380, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span> (1990).  General instructions regarding the presumption of innocence and the government's burden of proving all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt are insufficient to fulfill this explanatory role.  Id. at 651.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  So too are instructions directly contrary to the erroneous one which themselves correctly state the law.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Instead, there must be other language in the instructions which actually \"explains the infirm language sufficiently so that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it must [in the context of an erroneous malice instruction] find malice if it found petitioner [acted in such a way so as to trigger the unconstitutional presumption].\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents contend that four sections of the instructions, when taken together, sufficiently explain the infirm language.  After reviewing these four sections, and after further reviewing the instructions as a whole, we cannot agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two sections adduced by respondents involve definitions of malice given prior to the unconstitutional instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  In each of these two instances, the trial judge correctly instructed the jurors that malice was not proved where, among other things, there were \"extenuating circumstances\" sufficient to \"reduce the crime to manslaughter.\"   At most, we think that these two definitions of malice might have allowed the jurors to infer that the presumption set up by the subsequent unconstitutional charge could be rebutted in certain extenuating circumstances.  Cf. id. at 653.   We do not, however, see how these definitions could have explained to the jurors that the upcoming instruction was not going to mean what it actually and clearly stated.  At any rate, we reiterate that correct instructions, which directly contradict the erroneous instruction, are not sufficient to cure the error.  See supra at p. 737 and note 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other two sections cited by respondents are less compelling.  The first of these two, which again preceded the infirm instruction, primarily defined the terms \"aforethought\" and \"murder.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The second defined the term \"premeditated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Both of the passages are jumbled and confusing, especially when compared to the short and relatively straightforward statement which set up the unconstitutional mandatory presumption.  Cf. Hill, 927 F.2d at 652 (juxtaposing clumsily-worded correct instruction with clear and concise unconstitutional instruction in deciding that correct portions of charge as a whole did not negate the effects of the presumption-creating language).  Moreover, neither passage explicitly touched on the concept of malice, except insofar as the first one briefly discussed the \"aforethought\" component of the term \"malice aforethought.\"   In light of these deficiencies, we do not see how these passages could have actually explained the challenged instruction \"so as to offset any erroneous impression given by [it].\"  See id. at 651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding our analysis of the entire charge, we pause to note that, because it was framed in irrefutable and unvarying terms (\"[m]alice is implied in every deliberate and cruel act by one against another\"), we think it at least reasonably likely that the challenged instruction completely removed the element of malice from the case once the Commonwealth established that petitioner had acted deliberately and cruelly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Therefore, in conducting our harmless-error analysis, we will regard the instruction as having erected a conclusive mandatory presumption.  See Hill, 927 F.2d at 649 n. 3 (distinguishing between conclusive mandatory presumptions and rebuttable mandatory presumptions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we agree with the district court that the charge as a whole did not neutralize the effect of the presumption-creating language.

Pointing to (1) the state's interest in finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system;  (2) the interests of comity;  (3) the interests of federalism;  and (4) the interest of maintaining the prominence of the trial itself, the Court decided that application of the Chapman standard to trial errors challenged on habeas resulted in an \"imbalance of ... costs and benefits.\"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1721.   Accordingly, the Court embraced the less onerous Kotteakos standard, holding that it applies \"in determining whether habeas relief must be granted because of constitutional error of the trial type.\"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1722.

Thus, we train our sights on whether, in light of the whole record, respondents have met their burden<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> of demonstrating that the conclusive presumption did not actually prejudice petitioner because it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.

Rather, petitioner's argument is that the conclusive presumption precluded the jury from convicting him of manslaughter on a theory of \"sudden combat.\"   See Commonwealth v.

While we concede (1) that there was evidence (i.e., the testimony that petitioner stabbed Cullen because he thought Cullen was \"going to jump him from behind\" and/or because he thought Cullen was \"beating up Kevin Martin\") which might conceivably have provided a basis for the jury to have concluded that the government had not proved an absence of sudden combat;  and (2) that the conclusive presumption tended to deter the jury from considering this evidence, see Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n. 10, 111 S.Ct. at 1894 n. 10 (conclusive presumptions tend to deter a jury from considering any evidence for the presumed fact beyond the predicate evidence), we think it extremely unlikely that the jury would have relied on this evidence and returned a verdict of manslaughter.  Mary VanGordon testified that the stabbing was administered while the victim was being held by another man.  Moreover, the evidence reveals that the victim was stabbed nine times, with six of the stab wounds being delivered to the chest area.  In our view, such evidence, when combined with the fact that the defense never specifically argued a sudden combat theory to the jury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> strongly undermines any claim that petitioner was, throughout the entirety of the stabbing, acting in response to sudden combat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that the erroneous instruction had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's verdict.

For, implicit in this facially uncontroversial statement are two radical assumptions:  (1) that, in the habeas context, reviewing courts now are obliged to supply missing factual findings;  and (2) that, in the habeas context, reviewing courts can and should rely upon evidence that the jury did not consider.

Indeed, given the \"sound presumption of appellate practice[ ] that jurors are reasonable and generally follow the instructions they are given,\" id. at 403, 111 S.Ct. at 1893, a reviewing court must assume that the jury did not consider evidence beyond that relating to the predicate facts, because \"to do so would be a waste of the jury's time and contrary to its instructions,\" id. at 406 n. 10, 1894 n. 10;  see also Carella, 491 U.S. at 269, 109 S.Ct. at 2422 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of this is not to say that a conclusive presumption can never be harmless error.

Whereas it makes sense in the case of the more typical form of constitutional error--improperly admitted evidence and/or improperly allowed argument--to perform the type of whole-record \"quantitative assessment\" outlined in Brecht (and, incidentally, also outlined in Chapman ) in order \"to determine whether the fact supported by [the] improperly admitted evidence [or improperly allowed argument] was in any event overwhelmingly established by other evidence,\" see id., such an inquiry makes no sense where the error is not that the jury may have been swayed by tainted information, but rather is that the jury failed to consider relevant evidence and failed to make a required finding, id. at 267-69, 109 S.Ct. at 2421.

Seeking to avoid the specter of factfinding by reviewing courts on the basis of evidence the jury never considered, the Carella test does not direct courts to ascertain whether the presumed fact was otherwise established to varying degrees by the evidence (as the Brecht and Chapman tests would do).  Rather, the test instructs reviewing courts to ask (1) whether the instruction established a conclusive presumption on a charge which did not affect other charges and on which the defendant was acquitted;  (2) whether the instruction established a conclusive presumption with respect to an element of the crime which the defendant admitted;  or (3) whether</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact, making those findings [the] functional[ ] equivalent to ... the element required to be presumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423.   If the answer to any of these three questions is \"yes,\" the error is harmless.  See id.   Because this test faithfully preserves a criminal defendant's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to have an impartial jury make the requisite factual and elemental determinations in his/her trial, and because it provides assurance that reviewing courts will consider only the evidence that the jury considered, I would apply this test rather than the ill-defined harmless-error test that the majority employs today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before applying the Carella test to this case, I feel it appropriate to respond to the arguments against the Carella test and in favor of the whole-record approach outlined in Brecht.   Obviously, the most potent of these arguments is the one relied upon by the majority:  that the whole-record Brecht analysis applies to \"trial errors,\" that the Supreme Court, in a string citation in Fulminante, indicated that a conclusive presumption is \"trial error,\" and that we therefore are obliged to conduct our harmlessness review in light of the whole record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will admit that the Court's characterization of a conclusive presumption as \"trial error\" in Fulminante is troublesome;  indeed, I think this case well illustrates Justice White's criticism of the \"trial error\"/\"structural error\" dichotomy.  See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 291, 111 S.Ct. at 291 (White, J., dissenting in part) (arguing that, in assessing whether harmless-error analysis ought to be applied, courts should disregard the trial error/structural error distinction and instead \"consider[ ] the nature of the right at issue and the effect of [the] error upon the trial\").  Despite the aforementioned indication to the contrary, the presence of a non-harmless (as determined by the Carella test) conclusive presumption strikes me as a type of \"structural error.\"   See Carella, 491 U.S. at 268, 109 S.Ct. at 2419 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"The constitutional right to a jury trial embodies a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.  It is a structural guarantee that reflects a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power--a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges.\")  (emphasis supplied) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  cf. Sullivan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2083 (denial of the right to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is a structural error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, however, whether we label a conclusive presumption trial error, structural error, or something in between is of no consequence;  what matters instead is that we apply the appropriate form of harmless-error review in assessing the effects of that presumption.  Applying a whole-record review not only ignores the considerations outlined in Part A. of this dissent, but it also ignores two indications by Supreme Court majorities, subsequent to Fulminante, that the Carella analysis is properly employed by courts reviewing presumptions.  See Sullivan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2082 (indicating, in the direct review context, that Carella provides the proper framework for determining whether or not a mandatory presumption was harmless);  Yates, 500 U.S. at 406 n. 10, 111 S.Ct. at 1894 n. 10 (implicitly endorsing, in the habeas context, the Carella test as a means for evaluating whether or not a conclusive presumption was harmless).  One might argue that Yates has been superseded by Brecht, and that Brecht did not control in Sullivan because Sullivan was a direct review case.  In response, I would point out that Chapman, which did control in Yates and would have controlled in Sullivan had the error therein been deemed amenable to harmless-error review, contemplates a whole-record review every bit as much as Brecht does;  nonetheless, the Court has made clear in the Chapman context that, when confronted with presumption error, the typical form of whole-record analysis does not apply.  Thus, I read the string citation in Fulminante as merely indicating that a conclusive presumption is amenable to harmless-error review.  I do not read it as stating that such a presumption is subject to the usual whole-record harmless-error test applicable to most other forms of trial error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might also be argued that the Carella test derives from Chapman, see Carella, 491 U.S. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423 (Scalia, J., concurring) (noting that if the Carella test is met, \"[t]he error is harmless because it is 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that the jury found the facts necessary to support the conviction\") (citing Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828), and that the replacement of Chapman with Brecht on habeas means that the Carella concurrence has no relevance in habeas cases.  In response, I would concede that the Carella test can be theoretically viewed as \"deriving from\" Chapman.   In my view, however, the Carella concurrence can just as easily and fairly be read as (1) explaining that a conclusive presumption sets up an error which tends to undermine a structural guarantee of the Constitution and which only can be harmless in those \"rare\" circumstances where the presumption did not play \"any role\" in the jury's verdict;  (2) setting forth the test for determining whether the error played any such role;  and (3) noting, in conclusion and without prior reference to Chapman, that when the Carella test is met, the Chapman test also is met.  In light of this, and because abandoning Carella necessarily means that we must welcome factfinding by habeas courts on the basis of evidence the jury did not consider, I prefer the latter reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third argument might be that, in Yates, the Supreme Court has already ratified factfinding by habeas courts.  My response to such an argument simply would be that I agree.  As I see it, the Yates test for reviewing the effects of rebuttable mandatory presumptions, which impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant, does, despite the Supreme Court's indications to the contrary, reek of factfinding by reviewing courts.  Cf. generally Yates, 500 U.S. at 411, 111 S.Ct. at 1898 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that, when a jury has been directed to apply a rebuttable mandatory presumption, it has never found that the prosecution proved the element on which the presumption was erected beyond a reasonable doubt).  However, as Justice Scalia notes in his Carella concurrence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>It is one thing to say that the effect of th[e] erroneous burden-shifting [effectuated by a rebuttable presumption] will be disregarded if the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;  it is quite another to say that the jury's failure to make any factual determination of the elemental fact--because of a conclusive presumption resting upon findings that do not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the elemental fact--will be similarly disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carella, 491 U.S. at 273, 109 S.Ct. at 2424 (Scalia, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted) (arguing the particular propriety of the Carella test to the conclusive presumption context).  Thus, I do not think that the Yates test can and should be read as implicitly endorsing the type of factfinding the majority engages in today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one might argue, as does the Brecht majority, that wholesale use of the Brecht test promotes the principles of restraint, often couched in terms of \"comity\" and \"federalism,\" underlying the Supreme Court's more recent habeas jurisprudence.  In response, I could only agree if \"restraint\" is defined solely in terms of state prisoners not being granted very many writs of habeas corpus.  For, I think it obvious that factfinding on the basis of record evidence that the jury never considered cannot be cited as evidence of judicial restraint.  So too do I think it obvious that principles of comity and federalism should never require the continued incarceration of a state prisoner who was not afforded his/her constitutional rights to have an impartial jury make the requisite factual and elemental determinations in his/her trial just because a federal judge or a panel of federal judges believe that guilt is \"likely\" spelt out by the record.

Bollenbach, 326 U.S. at 614, 66 S.Ct. at 406.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of the Carella test to the case at bar easily yields the conclusion that the error here was not harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  I start from the premise that the question of whether an unlawful killing constitutes murder or manslaughter turns on whether or not the killing was committed with malice.

See supra at p. 737.  Such a reading would, however, have been quite strained.  In any case, we think it at least as likely that the jurors ignored the correct malice instructions which are facially irreconcilable with the challenged instruction.  See supra note 10</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We acknowledge that the majority opinion in Brecht treats the burden as petitioner's.  See  Brecht, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1722.   Nonetheless, as Justice Stevens, who provided the crucial fifth vote in Brecht, convincingly explains in his concurring opinion, the Kotteakos test requires that the party arguing the harmlessness of an error which tends to prejudice a litigant's \"substantial rights\" (as all constitutional errors surely do) must bear the burden of proof.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1723-24 and n. 1 (Stevens, J., concurring).  Given this authority, and given the further fact that there appear to be five votes for this position and only four votes for placing the burden on petitioner, we will regard the burden of proof as resting upon the respondents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> It is clear from the record that petitioner focused his defense efforts on arguing that the prosecution did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was, in fact, the stabber</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> In so ruling, we express no opinion as to the district court's conclusion that the error here was harmless even under the Chapman standard</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Obviously, petitioner neither was acquitted of the charge on which the presumption was set up nor admitted at trial that if he did the stabbing, he did so maliciously.  Thus, I restrict my inquiry under Carella to whether the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to malice that no rational jury could have found those facts without also finding malice</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Even were I to employ the deferential standard of review the majority utilizes, I could not join the majority opinion.  As I have explained, the error committed here had the effect of deterring the jury from considering evidence of sudden combat.  Yet, there was an abundance of such evidence;  indeed, it is undisputed that the stabbing took place in the midst of a drunken melee.  In light of this, and in light of the further fact that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving an absence of sudden combat beyond a reasonable doubt, see Nieves, 476 N.E.2d at 182, I am at a loss to see how the error can be viewed as harmless even under Brecht</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
