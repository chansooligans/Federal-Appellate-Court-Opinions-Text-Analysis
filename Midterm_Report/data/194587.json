The\n\nLTDP  provides  a  continuing   source  of  income  for  eligible\n\nemployees who become disabled and unable to work for a continuous\n\nperiod  of  six months  or longer.   The  VSP was  a new  plan of\n\nlimited  duration introduced by Chase in August of 1990 to reduce\n\nits work force.   The  VSP offered employees  who applied  before\n\nSeptember  10, 1990,  and who  were accepted  into the  program a\n\npackage  of  benefits:   severance pay;  up  to twelve  months of\n\nhealth care costs coverage; up to twelve months of coverage under\n\nthe  Chase   life  insurance  plan,  and   group  counselling  to\n\nfacilitate transition  to another job with  a different employer.\n\nThe VSP application contained waiver and release provisions.\n\n          Rodriguez  was employed  by  Chase from  1957 until  he\n\n                                4\n\nresigned effective September  21, 1990, as  a participant in  the\n\nVSP.   The parties stipulated that Rodriguez was absent from work\n\nfrom March 19 until the effective date of  his resignation due to\n\na heart  ailment.1    While  he  was absent,  Rodriguez was  paid\n\nfirst through his accumulated vacation and sick leave and then by\n\nChase through a special paid sick leave.  Rodriguez did not apply\n\nfor or receive LTDP benefits before his resignation from Chase.2\n\n           Chase introduced  the VSP  on August 8,  and Rodriguez\n\nattended  the  orientation   meeting  on  August  10.     At  the\n\norientation,   Rodriguez   inquired  as   to  whether   he  could\n\nparticipate  in both the VSP and LTDP, and the Chase Compensation\n\nManager  informed  him  that   the  Bank  would  investigate  his\n\nquestion.   On  August 17,  Rodriguez met  with  Migdalia Lebron,\n\n                    \n\n     1   The  district  court stated  in  its Opinion  and  Order\ngranting  summary judgment  for Chase  that Rodriguez  was absent\nfrom  March 6  until  he resigned  effective  September 21.    On\nappeal, Chase argues that Rodriguez was not continuously disabled\nfor  the requisite six months prior to his resignation to qualify\nhim  for LTDP  benefits.   Chase  points to  other dates  used to\ndetermine the  date of  disability: (1) Statement  of Uncontested\nMaterial Facts in the Pretrial Order that Rodriguez stated in his\nDisability-Benefits Application  Form signed on June  22, that he\nhad  been unable to  work since  April 25,  and (2)  the parties'\nstipulation  that  the  disability  period  for  Social  Security\nbenefits began on April 26.    Rodriguez   replies   that   Chase\nshould be held to the stipulated date, March 19, for absence from\nwork.  \n\n     2   Rodriguez stated in his letter to the Plan Administrator\nof the LTDP, dated October  17, 1990, that he had been  told that\nhe  could  not submit  claims for  LTDP  benefits until  his non-\noccupational disability insurance benefits ended  in September or\nOctober of 1990.  On appeal he explains that he did not apply for\nLTDP benefits because the Chase representatives  told him that he\nwould  have to  withdraw his  application for  the VSP  before he\ncould apply for LTDP benefits.\n\n                                5\n\nEmployee Benefits Officer of Chase, and asked about participation\n\nin both the  VSP and LTDP.   She told him that she  would ask the\n\nPlan Administrator in  New York.   Also on  August 17,  Rodriguez\n\nsigned the  Application and  Release for  the VSP which  provided\n\nthat it could be withdrawn before  September 10.  During the week\n\nof  August 20, Mrs. Lebron  informed Rodriguez that  he could not\n\nparticipate  in both the LTDP and the  VSP and that he would have\n\nto withdraw  his application for  the VSP  in order to  apply for\n\nLTDP benefits.   Rodriguez did  not withdraw his  application for\n\nthe  VSP.   Rodriguez's  application  was  accepted by  Chase  on\n\nSeptember  13, and  his  voluntary separation  from Chase  became\n\neffective on September 21, 1990.\n\n          On  October   17,   Rodriguez   wrote   to   the   Plan\n\nAdministrator  of the LTDP  requesting a  review of  the decision\n\nthat he was not  entitled to benefits from both  programs, review\n\nof  the amount  awarded for  severance, and  copies of  the \"Plan\n\nAdministration\"  books for the two  plans.  Chase  responded by a\n\nletter from Charles A. Smith,  Executive Vice President of Chase,\n\ndated December 28, that Rodriguez's eligibility for LTDP benefits\n\nended on  September 21  with the  termination of  his employment,\n\nthat he had given up his rights to LTDP benefits when he chose to\n\nparticipate  in  the VSP  and  denied  his  claim  for  increased\n\nseverance benefits.  Chase provided summary plan descriptions for\n\nthe  VSP and  LTDP and  provided a  telephone number  for further\n\nquestions.  On January 30, 1991, Rodriguez, through a letter from\n\nhis  attorney, requested review of the October determination as a\n\n                                6\n\n\"final administrative appeal,\" and  again requested copies of the\n\n\"Plan  Administration\"  booklets.     Chase  affirmed  denial  of\n\nRodriguez's claims on March 12  and sent more copies of the  plan\n\nsummaries  for  the  VSP   and  LTDP.    Chase  sent   the  \"Plan\n\nAdministration\"  booklets  on  May  2, 1991.    In  the meantime,\n\nRodriguez had begun the present action against Chase.3\n\n          Both  Chase  and  Rodriguez filed  motions  for summary\n\njudgment.   The district court granted Chase's motion for summary\n\njudgment, and  also granted Rodriguez's claim  that his severance\n\npay benefits  should have  been  determined based  upon his  last\n\nscheduled salary  review, and  awarded him the  increased amount.\n\nOn appeal,  Rodriguez contends that  he was  entitled to  receive\n\nlong-term  disability benefits  which were  denied by  Chase, and\n\nthat  the district  court should  have imposed  sanctions against\n\nChase  for  its  delay  in  providing  Rodriguez  with  requested\n\ninformation  about Chase's  long-term disability  plan.   Neither\n\nparty  appeals  the  district   court's  award  to  Rodriguez  of\n\nincreased severance benefits.\n\n                               II.\n\n                    \n\n     3   The issue of  exhaustion of administrative  remedies has\nnot been raised  in this case.  Most courts,  including this one,\ngenerally require exhaustion of  administrative remedies in ERISA\ncases.  Drinkwater  v. Metropolitan Life Insurance  Co., 846 F.2d\n                                                       \n821,  826 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 488 U.S.  909 (1988); United\n                                                                 \nPaperworkers v.

Under the  circumstances in\nthis case, particularly in  light of the fact that  the plaintiff\ndid not receive the information which  specified the final appeal\nprocess to the Named  Fiduciaries until after suit was  begun, we\nwill  not  address  the  issue of  exhaustion  of  administrative\nremedies.\n\n                                7\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                          \n\n          We follow the familiar  standard when reviewing summary\n\njudgment in ERISA actions.

Summary  judgment  is\n\nappropriate  if  the factual  materials  submitted  to the  court\n\nestablish  that there is no genuine dispute as to material facts,\n\nand if  the moving party is  entitled to judgment as  a matter of\n\nlaw.

Brown  v. Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp.,  876 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n546, 550 (6th Cir. 1989).     \n\n          In this case, the district court employed the de novo\n                                                               \n\nstandard  based  upon its  findings  that  Rodriguez's claim  was\n\ndenied by the Plan  Administrator5, and neither the LTDP  nor the\n\nPlan  Administration Booklet  granted discretionary  authority to\n\nthe  Plan Administrator  necessary  to invoke  the arbitrary  and\n\ncapricious standard.   The  Plan Administration  Booklet contains\n\nthe only direct statements  of authority for determining benefits\n\nunder Chase's benefit plans:\n\n          Named Fiduciaries\n          The Named Fiduciaries have  general authority\n          over  the administration and operation of the\n          Plans.  \n                . . .    \n\n          Plan Administrator\n          The    Plan   Administrator    is   primarily\n          responsible    for    the   publication    of\n\n                    \n\n     5  The  Plan  Administration  Booklet  identifies  the  plan\nadministrator  for  all  of   Chase's  benefit  programs  as  the\nCorporate Human Resources Executive.\n\n                                9\n\n          information  to  Plan  participants  and  the\n          filing of reports regarding the Plans.\n                . . .\n\n          In  making   a  final  decision,   the  Named\n          Fiduciaries    or   their    delegates   have\n          discretion  in  interpreting  the meaning  of\n          Plan provisions and in  determining questions\n          of fact.\n\nRodriguez did not make a written request of the Named Fiduciaries\n\nas  provided  in the  Plan Administration  Booklet, but  sent his\n\nletter of  October 17, requesting a  review of the denial  of his\n\nLTDP  benefits, to  the  Corporate Human  Resources Executive  of\n\nChase.   His letter was  answered by Charles  A. Smith, Executive\n\nVice President  of  Chase, and  further communication  concerning\n\nRodriguez's claims for LTDP benefits and additional severance pay\n\nwas with Mr. Smith.           Chase  contends  that the  district\n\ncourt should have used the deferential, arbitrary and capricious,\n\nstandard because the Plan Administrator (Smith) was acting as the\n\ndelegate of  the Named Fiduciaries who  are granted discretionary\n\nauthority.  Chase points to the fact that Smith used \"we\" instead\n\nof \"I\" in his  response to Rodriguez's final request  which Chase\n\nsuggests  means  that   Smith  was  acting   on  behalf  of   the\n\nFiduciaries.  Chase also argues  that because Smith was answering\n\nRodriquez's final request for review, his response was  the final\n\ndetermination of Rodriguez's claim on behalf of the Fiduciaries.\n\n            As the  district court  found, neither the  LTDP, the\n\nVSP,  nor  the  Plan  Administration  booklet  granted  the  Plan\n\nAdministrator discretionary authority to review claims.  The Plan\n\n                                10\n\nAdministration  booklet granted  the Plan  Fiduciaries, or  their\n\ndelegates,  discretionary   authority.     ERISA   allows   named\n\nfiduciaries  to  delegate  responsibilities (other  than  trustee\n\nresponsibilities)  through express  procedures  provided  in  the\n\nplan.   29 U.S.C.   1105(c)(1).6   To be an  effective delegation\n\nof discretionary  authority so  that the deferential  standard of\n\nreview  will   apply,  therefore,  the  fiduciary  must  properly\n\ndesignate a delegate for the fiduciary's discretionary authority.\n\nMadden v. ITT Long  Term Disability Plan, 914 F.2d  1279, 1283-84\n                                        \n\n(9th Cir. 1990).\n\n          Chase's claim that Smith was  acting as the delegate of\n\nthe Fiduciaries fails for  lack of evidence.  First,  Chase fails\n\nto point to  any plan provisions which provide express procedures\n\nfor the delegation of  the Fiduciary's discretionary authority to\n\na  delegate, and  we  have found  none.     Second,  there is  no\n\nexpression  of intent  that  Smith act  as  the delegate  of  the\n\nFiduciaries and  Smith did not claim to be acting on behalf of or\n\nas the delegate  of the  Fiduciaries.  Instead,  Chase relies  on\n\ninferences from the circumstances to establish that Smith was the\n\ndelegate of the Fiduciaries, which  we find insufficient to prove\n\n                    \n\n     6  29 U.S.C.   1105(c)(1) provides:\n          The   instrument  under   which  a   plan  is\n          maintained   may    expressly   provide   for\n          procedures   (A)  for   allocating  fiduciary\n          responsibilities    (other    than    trustee\n          responsibilities)  among  named  fiduciaries,\n          and  (B) for  named fiduciaries  to designate\n          persons other than named fiduciaries to carry\n          out  fiduciary  responsibilities (other  than\n          trustee responsibilities) under the plan.\n\n                                11\n\ndelegation   of  discretionary  authority,  particularly  in  the\n\ncontext  of Chase's  motion for  summary judgment.   Because  the\n\nrelevant plan documents did  not grant discretionary authority to\n\nthe  Plan  Administrator  and   the  Named  Fiduciaries  did  not\n\nexpressly  delegate their  discretionary  authority to  the  Plan\n\nAdministrator, we find that the district court correctly employed\n\nthe de novo standard of review.\n           \n\n                               III.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          ERISA   regulates   employee   benefit  plans   through\n\nstandards of conduct for fiduciaries, requirements of information\n\ndisclosure, schedules  for accrual and vesting  of pension funds,\n\nand  by providing remedies and access  to the courts. 29 U.S.C.  \n\n1001(b); Massachusetts  v.

Both  parties contend  that  the language  is\n\nplain   and   unambiguous,   but   they   disagree    about   the\n\ninterpretation.  Rodriguez contends that the emphasized  language\n\n                                16\n\nexcepts  his right to LTDP  benefits from the  waiver because his\n\nright  to  those   benefits  had  \"vested\":     his  rights  were\n\nestablished and  fixed because  he had fulfilled  the eligibility\n\nrequirements  and, therefore,  he was  entitled to  the benefits.\n\nChase counters  that  \"vested\", as  used  in the  release,  means\n\npension benefits  which are the  benefits that ERISA  requires to\n\nvest.   Because  the parties  attribute reasonable  but differing\n\nmeanings to the term \"vested\", we find that the term is ambiguous\n\nas used in  the emphasized  language of the  VSP Application  and\n\nRelease.   \n\n          The  Second Circuit has  recently addressed the meaning\n\nof \"vested\" in the context of an exception to a release clause in\n\na  stock purchase  agreement which  involved release  of benefits\n\nfrom  ERISA plans in Healy  v. Rich Products  Corp., No. 92-7398,\n                                                   \n\n1992 WL 358117  (2d Cir. Dec 7, 1992).   The plaintiff, in Healy,\n                                                                \n\nhad  specifically  requested that  language  be  inserted in  the\n\nrelease  to except  particular plans  from  which he  was already\n\nreceiving benefits.  The defendant  added language to the release\n\nusing  the  term  \"vested\"   apparently  to  effect  the  purpose\n\nrequested  by  the plaintiff,  and  then  claimed on  motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment that  the  term \"vested\"  did  not include  the\n\nplaintiff's benefits.   The  district court  did not address  the\n\nintent  of  the  parties,  but  instead  used the  definition  of\n\n\"vested\" from the ERISA  statute as applied to pension  plans and\n\nfound that the term did not include the plaintiff's benefits.  On\n\nappeal,  the Second  Circuit  held that  the  term could  not  be\n\n                                17\n\ndefined by the ERISA statute because the plans at issue were  not\n\nERISA pension plans.

In the  case before us, the evidence of\n\nintent is  undisputed and does not  require factual determination\n\nby the district court.  \n\n          To divine the  parties' intent in this case, we examine\n\nthe VSP Application  and Release  as a whole  and the  undisputed\n\ncircumstances surrounding  the formation of the contract.  In the\n\nApplication   section,   the  Separation   Incentive  sub-section\n\nprovides:  \"I understand that, if this application is accepted, I\n\nwill receive the  following benefits  in lieu of  any benefits  I\n\nmight otherwise receive under Chase's salary continuance  policy:\n\n[benefits  are  listed].\"   The LTDP  is  part of  Chase's salary\n\ncontinuance policy because the  stated purpose of the LTDP  is to\n\nprovide a disabled  employee with a  continuing source of  income\n\nduring  the disability,  and LTDP  benefits are  determined based\n\nupon  the employee's  monthly base  salary.   The parties  do not\n\ndispute the meaning of  this provision and the meaning  is plain:\n\nRodriguez agreed to waive his rights to LTDP benefits in exchange\n\n                                18\n\nfor the benefits listed in the VSP.    \n\n          The undisputed circumstances surrounding  Chase's offer\n\nof  the VSP also demonstrate  that Chase's intent  was to require\n\nwaiver  of  other   benefits,  such  as  LTDP  benefits,  by  VSP\n\nparticipants.  During the orientation and application process for\n\nthe  VSP, Rodriguez  asked  the Chase  representative whether  he\n\ncould participate in  the VSP  and still  receive LTDP  benefits.\n\nThe representative consulted with the Plan Administrator and then\n\ninformed Rodriguez that the two plans were mutually exclusive and\n\nthat he would have to withdraw his application for the  VSP if he\n\nwanted  to  preserve  his  right  to  apply  for  LTDP  benefits.\n\nRodriguez decided not to withdraw his VSP application and did not\n\npursue  his   LTDP  benefits  until  after   his  employment  was\n\nterminated.  Despite Rodriguez's arguments to the contrary, there\n\ncan be no genuine dispute that based upon the VSP Application and\n\nRelease,  read as a whole,  and Chase's declared  intent that the\n\nVSP and LTDP be mutually exclusive, the plain meaning of \"vested\"\n\ndoes not include  Rodriguez's LTDP benefits even  if the benefits\n\nhad vested or accrued before the time of the release.  \n\n          ERISA  does   not   prohibit  knowing   and   voluntary\n\nrelinquishment  of  employee benefits.

Matter  of  Heci\n                                                                 \n\nExploration Co.,  Inc., 862 F.2d 513, 523 (5th Cir. 1988).  To be\n                      \n\nvalid,  a  waiver  of  ERISA  benefits  must  be  an  intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.  Id.\n                                                                 \n\n           Rodriguez was  aware of his potential  eligibility for\n\nLTDP  benefits when  he began  the orientation  for the VSP.   He\n\nasked  about receiving  both  VSP and  LTDP  benefits, and  Chase\n\npersonnel informed  him that  the plans were  mutually exclusive,\n\nthat he  would lose his right  to LTDP benefits if  he elected to\n\nparticipate in  the VSP, and that  if he wished to  continue as a\n\nChase  employee and  apply for  LTDP benefits,  he would  have to\n\nwithdraw  his   VSP  application.    Rodriguez   admits  that  he\n\nunderstood  that   he  was   presented  with  a   choice  between\n\nalternatives:   (1)  choose  the VSP,  terminate employment  with\n\nChase, and  receive the  lump  sum separation  payment and  other\n\nbenefits; or  (2) continue  employment with  Chase and  apply for\n\nLTDP benefits.  He was a  management level employee at Chase.  He\n\nconsulted  an  accountant  about  the  plans.    Armed  with  the\n\nnecessary information concerning his alternatives, Rodriguez made\n\na voluntary and  informed choice  to participate in  the VSP  and\n\nwaive  his right to LTDP benefits.  Under these circumstances, we\n\nfind that Rodriguez's  waiver was valid and that  he relinquished\n\n                                20\n\nhis  right, if any, to  claim LTDP benefits  after termination of\n\nhis employment with Chase pursuant to the terms of the VSP.\n\nC.   Denial of Request for Imposition of Penalties\n                                                  \n\n          A plan administrator is obligated by statute, 29 U.S.C.\n\n  1024(b)(4),9  to provide specified  information about  employee\n\nbenefit plans  to  participants  or  beneficiaries  upon  written\n\nrequest.    In  this  case,  Rodriguez,  and  then  his  counsel,\n\nrequested,  in writing,  the  Plan  Administration booklets  from\n\nChase's  Plan Administrator who sent the plan summary for the VSP\n\nand  the plan  booklet for  the  LTDP instead.    After the  last\n\nrequest, the  Plan  Administrator sent  the  Plan  Administration\n\nbooklet.\n\n           The  district court  denied  Rodriguez's  request  for\n\npenalties to be imposed on Chase's Plan Administrator pursuant to\n\n29  U.S.C.    1132(c)(1)10  on the  grounds  that \"Rodriguez  has\n\n                    \n\n     9  29 U.S.C.   1024(b)(4) provides:\n             The  administrator   shall,  upon  written\n          request  of  any participant  or beneficiary,\n          furnish a copy of the latest  updated summary\n          plan description, plan  description, and  the\n          latest  annual  report, any  terminal report,\n          the  bargaining  agreement, trust  agreement,\n          contract,  or  other instruments  under which\n          the  plan  is established  or operated.   The\n          administrator may make a reasonable charge to\n          cover  the cost  of furnishing  such complete\n          copies.   The  Secretary  may  by  regulation\n          prescribe  the  maximum  amount   which  will\n          constitute  a  reasonable  charge  under  the\n          preceding sentence.\n\n     10  29 U.S.C.   1132(c)(1) provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Any  administrator.  .   .(B)  who  fails  or\n          refuses  to comply  with  a request  for  any\n          information   which  such   administrator  is\n\n                                21\n\nfailed  to  show  that  his  rights  were  harmed  or   otherwise\n\nprejudiced by the delay in his receipt of the information and has\n\nnot  demonstrated bad faith or  intentional delay on  the part of\n\nthe defendant.\"   The  imposition of  penalties is committed,  by\n\nstatute, to  the discretion of the  trial court, and we  will not\n\noverturn the court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.\n\nFisher v.

We also  agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Rodriguez failed to show that his rights were\n\nprejudiced  by  the delay.   Rodriguez  asserts  that he  was not\n\ninformed  of the proper appeal process until he received the Plan\n\nAdministration booklet in May, but he does not show how the delay\n\ncaused  him harm.11  Therefore,  we find that  the district court\n\ndid not  abuse its  discretion by  declining to  impose penalties\n\nagainst the Plan Administrator.\n\n          Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     11 Because  exhaustion of administrative remedies  is not an\nissue  in this case, Rodriguez's  failure to file  a final appeal\nwith   the   Named  Fiduciaries,   as   provided   in  the   Plan\nAdministration booklet, has not prejudiced his court action.\n\n                                23\n",

The\n\nLTDP  provides  a  continuing   source  of  income  for  eligible\n\nemployees who become disabled and unable to work for a continuous\n\nperiod  of  six months  or longer.   The  VSP was  a new  plan of\n\nlimited  duration introduced by Chase in August of 1990 to reduce\n\nits work force.   The  VSP offered employees  who applied  before\n\nSeptember  10, 1990,  and who  were accepted  into the  program a\n\npackage  of  benefits:   severance pay;  up  to twelve  months of\n\nhealth care costs coverage; up to twelve months of coverage under\n\nthe  Chase   life  insurance  plan,  and   group  counselling  to\n\nfacilitate transition  to another job with  a different employer.\n\nThe VSP application contained waiver and release provisions.\n\n          Rodriguez  was employed  by  Chase from  1957 until  he\n\n                                4\n\nresigned effective September  21, 1990, as  a participant in  the\n\nVSP.   The parties stipulated that Rodriguez was absent from work\n\nfrom March 19 until the effective date of  his resignation due to\n\na heart  ailment.1    While  he  was absent,  Rodriguez was  paid\n\nfirst through his accumulated vacation and sick leave and then by\n\nChase through a special paid sick leave.  Rodriguez did not apply\n\nfor or receive LTDP benefits before his resignation from Chase.2\n\n           Chase introduced  the VSP  on August 8,  and Rodriguez\n\nattended  the  orientation   meeting  on  August  10.     At  the\n\norientation,   Rodriguez   inquired  as   to  whether   he  could\n\nparticipate  in both the VSP and LTDP, and the Chase Compensation\n\nManager  informed  him  that   the  Bank  would  investigate  his\n\nquestion.   On  August 17,  Rodriguez met  with  Migdalia Lebron,\n\n                    \n\n     1   The  district  court stated  in  its Opinion  and  Order\ngranting  summary judgment  for Chase  that Rodriguez  was absent\nfrom  March 6  until  he resigned  effective  September 21.    On\nappeal, Chase argues that Rodriguez was not continuously disabled\nfor  the requisite six months prior to his resignation to qualify\nhim  for LTDP  benefits.   Chase  points to  other dates  used to\ndetermine the  date of  disability: (1) Statement  of Uncontested\nMaterial Facts in the Pretrial Order that Rodriguez stated in his\nDisability-Benefits Application  Form signed on June  22, that he\nhad  been unable to  work since  April 25,  and (2)  the parties'\nstipulation  that  the  disability  period  for  Social  Security\nbenefits began on April 26.    Rodriguez   replies   that   Chase\nshould be held to the stipulated date, March 19, for absence from\nwork.  \n\n     2   Rodriguez stated in his letter to the Plan Administrator\nof the LTDP, dated October  17, 1990, that he had been  told that\nhe  could  not submit  claims for  LTDP  benefits until  his non-\noccupational disability insurance benefits ended  in September or\nOctober of 1990.  On appeal he explains that he did not apply for\nLTDP benefits because the Chase representatives  told him that he\nwould  have to  withdraw his  application for  the VSP  before he\ncould apply for LTDP benefits.\n\n                                5\n\nEmployee Benefits Officer of Chase, and asked about participation\n\nin both the  VSP and LTDP.   She told him that she  would ask the\n\nPlan Administrator in  New York.   Also on  August 17,  Rodriguez\n\nsigned the  Application and  Release for  the VSP which  provided\n\nthat it could be withdrawn before  September 10.  During the week\n\nof  August 20, Mrs. Lebron  informed Rodriguez that  he could not\n\nparticipate  in both the LTDP and the  VSP and that he would have\n\nto withdraw  his application for  the VSP  in order to  apply for\n\nLTDP benefits.   Rodriguez did  not withdraw his  application for\n\nthe  VSP.   Rodriguez's  application  was  accepted by  Chase  on\n\nSeptember  13, and  his  voluntary separation  from Chase  became\n\neffective on September 21, 1990.\n\n          On  October   17,   Rodriguez   wrote   to   the   Plan\n\nAdministrator  of the LTDP  requesting a  review of  the decision\n\nthat he was not  entitled to benefits from both  programs, review\n\nof  the amount  awarded for  severance, and  copies of  the \"Plan\n\nAdministration\"  books for the two  plans.  Chase  responded by a\n\nletter from Charles A. Smith,  Executive Vice President of Chase,\n\ndated December 28, that Rodriguez's eligibility for LTDP benefits\n\nended on  September 21  with the  termination of  his employment,\n\nthat he had given up his rights to LTDP benefits when he chose to\n\nparticipate  in  the VSP  and  denied  his  claim  for  increased\n\nseverance benefits.  Chase provided summary plan descriptions for\n\nthe  VSP and  LTDP and  provided a  telephone number  for further\n\nquestions.  On January 30, 1991, Rodriguez, through a letter from\n\nhis  attorney, requested review of the October determination as a\n\n                                6\n\n\"final administrative appeal,\" and  again requested copies of the\n\n\"Plan  Administration\"  booklets.     Chase  affirmed  denial  of\n\nRodriguez's claims on March 12  and sent more copies of the  plan\n\nsummaries  for  the  VSP   and  LTDP.    Chase  sent   the  \"Plan\n\nAdministration\"  booklets  on  May  2, 1991.    In  the meantime,\n\nRodriguez had begun the present action against Chase.3\n\n          Both  Chase  and  Rodriguez filed  motions  for summary\n\njudgment.   The district court granted Chase's motion for summary\n\njudgment, and  also granted Rodriguez's claim  that his severance\n\npay benefits  should have  been  determined based  upon his  last\n\nscheduled salary  review, and  awarded him the  increased amount.\n\nOn appeal,  Rodriguez contends that  he was  entitled to  receive\n\nlong-term  disability benefits  which were  denied by  Chase, and\n\nthat  the district  court should  have imposed  sanctions against\n\nChase  for  its  delay  in  providing  Rodriguez  with  requested\n\ninformation  about Chase's  long-term disability  plan.   Neither\n\nparty  appeals  the  district   court's  award  to  Rodriguez  of\n\nincreased severance benefits.\n\n                               II.\n\n                    \n\n     3   The issue of  exhaustion of administrative  remedies has\nnot been raised  in this case.  Most courts,  including this one,\ngenerally require exhaustion of  administrative remedies in ERISA\ncases.  Drinkwater  v.

His letter was  answered by Charles  A. Smith, Executive\n\nVice President  of  Chase, and  further communication  concerning\n\nRodriguez's claims for LTDP benefits and additional severance pay\n\nwas with Mr. Smith.           Chase  contends  that the  district\n\ncourt should have used the deferential, arbitrary and capricious,\n\nstandard because the Plan Administrator (Smith) was acting as the\n\ndelegate of  the Named Fiduciaries who  are granted discretionary\n\nauthority.  Chase points to the fact that Smith used \"we\" instead\n\nof \"I\" in his  response to Rodriguez's final request  which Chase\n\nsuggests  means  that   Smith  was  acting   on  behalf  of   the\n\nFiduciaries.  Chase also argues  that because Smith was answering\n\nRodriquez's final request for review, his response was  the final\n\ndetermination of Rodriguez's claim on behalf of the Fiduciaries.\n\n            As the  district court  found, neither the  LTDP, the\n\nVSP,  nor  the  Plan  Administration  booklet  granted  the  Plan\n\nAdministrator discretionary authority to review claims.  The Plan\n\n                                10\n\nAdministration  booklet granted  the Plan  Fiduciaries, or  their\n\ndelegates,  discretionary   authority.     ERISA   allows   named\n\nfiduciaries  to  delegate  responsibilities (other  than  trustee\n\nresponsibilities)  through express  procedures  provided  in  the\n\nplan.   29 U.S.C.   1105(c)(1).6   To be an  effective delegation\n\nof discretionary  authority so  that the deferential  standard of\n\nreview  will   apply,  therefore,  the  fiduciary  must  properly\n\ndesignate a delegate for the fiduciary's discretionary authority.\n\nMadden v.

First,  Chase fails\n\nto point to  any plan provisions which provide express procedures\n\nfor the delegation of  the Fiduciary's discretionary authority to\n\na  delegate, and  we  have found  none.     Second,  there is  no\n\nexpression  of intent  that  Smith act  as  the delegate  of  the\n\nFiduciaries and  Smith did not claim to be acting on behalf of or\n\nas the delegate  of the  Fiduciaries.  Instead,  Chase relies  on\n\ninferences from the circumstances to establish that Smith was the\n\ndelegate of the Fiduciaries, which  we find insufficient to prove\n\n                    \n\n     6  29 U.S.C.   1105(c)(1) provides:\n          The   instrument  under   which  a   plan  is\n          maintained   may    expressly   provide   for\n          procedures   (A)  for   allocating  fiduciary\n          responsibilities    (other    than    trustee\n          responsibilities)  among  named  fiduciaries,\n          and  (B) for  named fiduciaries  to designate\n          persons other than named fiduciaries to carry\n          out  fiduciary  responsibilities (other  than\n          trustee responsibilities) under the plan.\n\n                                11\n\ndelegation   of  discretionary  authority,  particularly  in  the\n\ncontext  of Chase's  motion for  summary judgment.   Because  the\n\nrelevant plan documents did  not grant discretionary authority to\n\nthe  Plan  Administrator  and   the  Named  Fiduciaries  did  not\n\nexpressly  delegate their  discretionary  authority to  the  Plan\n\nAdministrator, we find that the district court correctly employed\n\nthe de novo standard of review.\n           \n\n                               III.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          ERISA   regulates   employee   benefit  plans   through\n\nstandards of conduct for fiduciaries, requirements of information\n\ndisclosure, schedules  for accrual and vesting  of pension funds,\n\nand  by providing remedies and access  to the courts. 29 U.S.C.  \n\n1001(b); Massachusetts  v.

Both  parties contend  that  the language  is\n\nplain   and   unambiguous,   but   they   disagree    about   the\n\ninterpretation.  Rodriguez contends that the emphasized  language\n\n                                16\n\nexcepts  his right to LTDP  benefits from the  waiver because his\n\nright  to  those   benefits  had  \"vested\":     his  rights  were\n\nestablished and  fixed because  he had fulfilled  the eligibility\n\nrequirements  and, therefore,  he was  entitled to  the benefits.\n\nChase counters  that  \"vested\", as  used  in the  release,  means\n\npension benefits  which are the  benefits that ERISA  requires to\n\nvest.   Because  the parties  attribute reasonable  but differing\n\nmeanings to the term \"vested\", we find that the term is ambiguous\n\nas used in  the emphasized  language of the  VSP Application  and\n\nRelease.   \n\n          The  Second Circuit has  recently addressed the meaning\n\nof \"vested\" in the context of an exception to a release clause in\n\na  stock purchase  agreement which  involved release  of benefits\n\nfrom  ERISA plans in Healy  v.

Dec 7, 1992).   The plaintiff, in Healy,\n                                                                \n\nhad  specifically  requested that  language  be  inserted in  the\n\nrelease  to except  particular plans  from  which he  was already\n\nreceiving benefits.  The defendant  added language to the release\n\nusing  the  term  \"vested\"   apparently  to  effect  the  purpose\n\nrequested  by  the plaintiff,  and  then  claimed on  motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment that  the  term \"vested\"  did  not include  the\n\nplaintiff's benefits.   The  district court  did not address  the\n\nintent  of  the  parties,  but  instead  used the  definition  of\n\n\"vested\" from the ERISA  statute as applied to pension  plans and\n\nfound that the term did not include the plaintiff's benefits.  On\n\nappeal,  the Second  Circuit  held that  the  term could  not  be\n\n                                17\n\ndefined by the ERISA statute because the plans at issue were  not\n\nERISA pension plans.   Accord Bellino, 944 F.2d  at 31 (\"we  give\n                                     \n\npreeminence  to the natural meaning  of ERISA plan  terms, and we\n\nmay not supplant  such meaning with rigid definitions or contrary\n\ninterpretations offered by the parties.\")  The Second Circuit, in\n\nHealy, remanded the case  to the district court to  determine the\n     \n\nmeaning of \"vested\" according  to ordinary principles of contract\n\ninterpretation with reference to  evidence of the parties' intent\n\nfrom the  surrounding circumstances including  extrinsic evidence\n\nof  intent if necessary.  In the  case before us, the evidence of\n\nintent is  undisputed and does not  require factual determination\n\nby the district court.  \n\n          To divine the  parties' intent in this case, we examine\n\nthe VSP Application  and Release  as a whole  and the  undisputed\n\ncircumstances surrounding  the formation of the contract.  In the\n\nApplication   section,   the  Separation   Incentive  sub-section\n\nprovides:  \"I understand that, if this application is accepted, I\n\nwill receive the  following benefits  in lieu of  any benefits  I\n\nmight otherwise receive under Chase's salary continuance  policy:\n\n[benefits  are  listed].\"   The LTDP  is  part of  Chase's salary\n\ncontinuance policy because the  stated purpose of the LTDP  is to\n\nprovide a disabled  employee with a  continuing source of  income\n\nduring  the disability,  and LTDP  benefits are  determined based\n\nupon  the employee's  monthly base  salary.   The parties  do not\n\ndispute the meaning of  this provision and the meaning  is plain:\n\nRodriguez agreed to waive his rights to LTDP benefits in exchange\n\n                                18\n\nfor the benefits listed in the VSP.    \n\n          The undisputed circumstances surrounding  Chase's offer\n\nof  the VSP also demonstrate  that Chase's intent  was to require\n\nwaiver  of  other   benefits,  such  as  LTDP  benefits,  by  VSP\n\nparticipants.  During the orientation and application process for\n\nthe  VSP, Rodriguez  asked  the Chase  representative whether  he\n\ncould participate in  the VSP  and still  receive LTDP  benefits.\n\nThe representative consulted with the Plan Administrator and then\n\ninformed Rodriguez that the two plans were mutually exclusive and\n\nthat he would have to withdraw his application for the  VSP if he\n\nwanted  to  preserve  his  right  to  apply  for  LTDP  benefits.\n\nRodriguez decided not to withdraw his VSP application and did not\n\npursue  his   LTDP  benefits  until  after   his  employment  was\n\nterminated.  Despite Rodriguez's arguments to the contrary, there\n\ncan be no genuine dispute that based upon the VSP Application and\n\nRelease,  read as a whole,  and Chase's declared  intent that the\n\nVSP and LTDP be mutually exclusive, the plain meaning of \"vested\"\n\ndoes not include  Rodriguez's LTDP benefits even  if the benefits\n\nhad vested or accrued before the time of the release.  \n\n          ERISA  does   not   prohibit  knowing   and   voluntary\n\nrelinquishment  of  employee benefits.

To be\n                      \n\nvalid,  a  waiver  of  ERISA  benefits  must  be  an  intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.

He\n\nasked  about receiving  both  VSP and  LTDP  benefits, and  Chase\n\npersonnel informed  him that  the plans were  mutually exclusive,\n\nthat he  would lose his right  to LTDP benefits if  he elected to\n\nparticipate in  the VSP, and that  if he wished to  continue as a\n\nChase  employee and  apply for  LTDP benefits,  he would  have to\n\nwithdraw  his   VSP  application.    Rodriguez   admits  that  he\n\nunderstood  that   he  was   presented  with  a   choice  between\n\nalternatives:   (1)  choose  the VSP,  terminate employment  with\n\nChase, and  receive the  lump  sum separation  payment and  other\n\nbenefits; or  (2) continue  employment with  Chase and  apply for\n\nLTDP benefits.  He was a  management level employee at Chase.  He\n\nconsulted  an  accountant  about  the  plans.    Armed  with  the\n\nnecessary information concerning his alternatives, Rodriguez made\n\na voluntary and  informed choice  to participate in  the VSP  and\n\nwaive  his right to LTDP benefits.  Under these circumstances, we\n\nfind that Rodriguez's  waiver was valid and that  he relinquished\n\n                                20\n\nhis  right, if any, to  claim LTDP benefits  after termination of\n\nhis employment with Chase pursuant to the terms of the VSP.\n\nC.

We also  agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Rodriguez failed to show that his rights were\n\nprejudiced  by  the delay.   Rodriguez  asserts  that he  was not\n\ninformed  of the proper appeal process until he received the Plan\n\nAdministration booklet in May, but he does not show how the delay\n\ncaused  him harm.11  Therefore,  we find that  the district court\n\ndid not  abuse its  discretion by  declining to  impose penalties\n\nagainst the Plan Administrator.\n\n          Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     11 Because  exhaustion of administrative remedies  is not an\nissue  in this case, Rodriguez's  failure to file  a final appeal\nwith   the   Named  Fiduciaries,   as   provided   in  the   Plan\nAdministration booklet, has not prejudiced his court action.\n\n                                23\n</pre>",
