Appellants  Michael Barnett and  Barry Jordan\n    CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                      \n\nwere charged, in a three-count indictment, with conspiracy to manufac-\n\nture and  possess with intent to distribute  methamphetamine in viola-\n\ntion of 21 U.S.C.   846, possession with intent to distribute  metham-\n\nphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a) (1), and possession of a\n\nlisted  chemical in violation  of 21 U.S.C.    841(d)(1).  Barnett was\n\nconvicted on all three  counts at trial; Jordan pleaded  guilty to all\n\nthree  counts shortly  after  the commencement  of  trial.   Each  was\n\nsentenced  to a thirty-year prison term  and a ten-year term of super-\n\nvised  release.  On appeal,  Barnett raises several  challenges to his\n\nconviction, and  joins Jordan in contesting  the drug-quantity finding\n\nmade by the district court at sentencing.  We affirm.  \n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n    In March  1990, the United  States Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\")\n\nbegan investigating a suspected conspiracy to manufacture and distrib-\n\nute methamphetamine.  Surveillance was initiated at three sites in the\n\nScituate,  Massachusetts area:   the residences of  each appellant and\n\nthe residence of their codefendant, Timothy Fitzgerald.1  \n\n    Approximately a  year before  the investigation  began, a  trailer\n\nstorage  company had  delivered a  forty-foot trailer  to Fitzgerald's\n\n                    \n\n     1Fitzgerald was acquitted at trial.\n\n                                  3\n\nresidence  in  Scituate.   The employee  who  made the  delivery later\n\ntestified that the  recipient of the  trailer, known to him  as \"Tim,\"\n\ninstructed that the trailer be placed as far back as possible into the\n\nwoods  located on  the  property.    Barnett subsequently  rented  the\n\ntrailer from Fitzgerald.\n\n    In  early May, 1990,  undercover DEA  Agent John  Kelly offered to\n\nsell  Jordan hydriodic  acid ostensibly  stolen by  Kelly.2   At their\n\nmeeting, Jordan  explained that his \"chemist\"  had enough pseudoephed-\n\nrine to produce forty  pounds (eighteen kilograms) of methamphetamine,\n\nbut  needed  twenty  pints of  hydriodic  acid  for the  manufacturing\n\nprocess.   During their  tape-recorded conversation, Jordan  agreed to\n\nbuy twenty  pints of hydriodic  acid, and  to provide Kelly  with four\n\nounces of methamphetamine  in return.   Jordan assured  Kelly that  he\n\nwould  receive four  \"uncut\" ounces,  and suggested  that Kelly  could\n\ndouble the volume by  diluting the pure methamphetamine with  an equal\n\namount of \"cut,\" then  sell the resulting  eight ounces for $2,000  an\n\nounce.\n\n    Jordan  described  the methamphetamine  manufacturing  process  to\n\nKelly, explaining  that it  took seven  to  eight days,  and that  his\n\nchemist  produced ten  pounds of  methamphetamine in  each batch.   To\n\nallay  Kelly's concern  about the  danger of  a laboratory  explosion,\n\n                    \n\n     2Hydriodic acid,  a listed chemical, is  essential to methamphet-\namine production  using the \"ephedrine reduction  process,\" which also\nrequires either ephedrine or  pseudoephedrine; red phosphorus may also\nbe used as  a purifying agent.   To convert  the methamphetamine  into\npowder for  distribution,  it is  dissolved  into freon  liquid,  then\nbubbled in hydrogen chloride gas.\n\n                                  4\n\nJordan explained  that his chemist had  been manufacturing methamphet-\n\namine for ten years, and volunteered that he had assisted  the chemist\n\nin preparing eight to ten batches one summer.3\n\n    As promised, on May 16, 1990,  Kelly delivered two boxes  contain-\n\ning  twenty half-liter  bottles (approximately  twenty pints)  of hyd-\n\nriodic  acid to  Jordan.   A different  DEA agent  followed  Jordan to\n\nBarnett's residence,  where he  observed Jordan and  Barnett unloading\n\ntwo boxes from the trunk of Jordan's car.\n\n    The  DEA  conducted a  series  of  aerial  surveillance  fly-overs\n\nduring  May 1990.  A fly-over of  the Fitzgerald residence on or about\n\nMay 27 revealed an electrical  power cord running from the  main house\n\nto the trailer.   (The  ephedrine reduction process  requires a  power\n\nsource to heat the chemicals.)\n\n    Two subsequent  fly-overs of  the Fitzgerald  residence were  con-\n\nducted  using  an infrared  heat-detecting  device  which operates  in\n\neither of two  polarity modes:  \"white-hot\" or  \"black-hot.\"  When the\n\ndevice is in the white-hot mode, objects emitting heat appear white on\n\nan  attached  screen; in  the  black-hot  mode, heat-emitting  objects\n\nappear black.  The  device detected no heat emission  from the trailer\n\nduring a  fly-over on May 28.   On May 30,  Massachusetts State Police\n\n                    \n\n     3After pleading guilty during  trial, Jordan submitted an affida-\nvit  in which he insisted  that these statements  were mere \"puffing,\"\nintended to  convince Kelly that he  was willing and able  to complete\ntheir transaction.   The affidavit  attests that  Jordan knew  nothing\nabout  the manufacture of methamphetamine,  and that his  only role in\nthe  enterprise was to obtain  hydriodic acid in  exchange for a small\namount of money to support his heroin habit.\n\n                                  5\n\nTrooper Richard Welby, who  had relatively little experience  with the\n\ninfrared equipment,  conducted another  fly-over.  Welby,  erroneously\n\nbelieving  the device  was in  the white-hot  mode, observed  that the\n\ntrailer  appeared white  on  the screen,  and  concluded that  it  was\n\nemitting heat.  Subsequent analysis revealed, however, that the device\n\nactually was in the black-hot mode during the May 30 fly-over, and the\n\ninfrared images, properly interpreted,  indicated that the trailer was\n\nemitting no detectible heat.\n\n    On the afternoon  of May 30, a DEA  agent followed Barnett to  the\n\nFitzgerald property.  When Barnett disappeared  down the driveway, the\n\nagent  left his  vehicle and  surreptitiously followed  on foot.   The\n\nagent spotted the  trailer and saw Barnett inside.   The agent noticed\n\nseveral  blue buckets, a white radiator, and  two boxes in the rear of\n\nthe trailer.   As the agent watched, Barnett scraped the bottom of one\n\nof the blue buckets for approximately five minutes, then poured liquid\n\ninto the bucket.  Barnett left the trailer and entered the main house,\n\nreturning  with several paper towels with which he filtered the yellow\n\nslushy contents of the bucket, then poured the filtered substance into\n\na  gray painter's tray.  Barnett made  another trip to the main house,\n\nthis time  returning with clear plastic  sandwich bags.  He  picked up\n\nthe gray painter's tray, rocked it back and forth  several times, then\n\npoured the yellow slushy substance into one of the bags, double-bagged\n\nit, and returned once again to the main house.\n\n    The DEA agent returned  to his vehicle, and  waited for Barnett to\n\ndrive  away.   After  about  twenty-five  minutes,  Barnett  left  the\n\n                                  6\n\nFitzgerald  property and drove to  a shopping center,  unaware that he\n\nwas  being followed  by the  agent.   When the  agent pulled  into the\n\nshopping  center parking lot, he  noticed a second  individual in Bar-\n\nnett's  vehicle.  The agent identified the second individual as appel-\n\nlant Jordan.\n\n    On May 30, DEA Agent Lemon  compiled the information obtained from\n\nthe  various surveillance  operations  (including the  erroneous heat-\n\nimaging  data interpretation) in an affidavit, which he attached to an\n\napplication  for a  warrant to  search the  trailer on  the Fitzgerald\n\nproperty,  the  Fitzgerald  and  Jordan residences,  and  a  residence\n\nbelieved to be occupied by Barnett.\n\n    The  investigation culminated  early  the next  morning  when  the\n\nsearch warrants were executed.  First, agents searched the  Fitzgerald\n\ntrailer,  unveiling a  partially  assembled laboratory  containing  an\n\narray  of chemicals,  including  hydriodic acid,  acetone, freon,  and\n\nhydrogen chloride gas,  and an assortment of equipment associated with\n\nmethamphetamine  production,  including  a radiator,  a  fan,  flasks,\n\ntubes, and a heater-timer.   Three ounces of methamphetamine  crystals\n\nand  a bucket  containing approximately  one pound  of methamphetamine\n\ncrystals  in two and one-half pounds of an acetone/freon solution were\n\nalso discovered.  Subsequent  analysis determined that the methamphet-\n\namine found in the bucket was between 90 and 100 percent pure.\n\n    DEA  agents arrested  Jordan and  Fitzgerald at  their  respective\n\nresidences.   At Jordan's residence, agents seized a small quantity of\n\na mixture containing heroin  and methamphetamine, as well as  a valium\n\n                                  7\n\ntablet,  several hypodermic needles, and several publications describ-\n\ning  the  methamphetamine  manufacturing  process.    At  Fitzgerald's\n\nresidence, agents found a piece of paper listing the chemical ingredi-\n\nents needed  to produce methamphetamine using  the ephedrine reduction\n\nprocess (\"the Fitzgerald chemical list\").\n\n    Barnett no  longer resided at the  residence for  which the fourth\n\nsearch warrant had been obtained.  When DEA agents arrested Barnett at\n\nhis new residence, he was  advised of his Miranda rights and  that the\n                                                 \n\nlaboratory  had been  discovered at  the Fitzgerald property.   Agents\n\nsearched  Barnett's new  residence,4  and discovered  a warehouse  re-\n\nceipt.   In response to a question from Agent Lemon about the receipt,\n\nBarnett  revealed that the remaining equipment and chemicals were in a\n\nstorage bin at the warehouse.  A warrant was secured and the search of\n\nthe storage bin uncovered approximately fifteen pounds of red phospho-\n\nrous,  a  seventy-pound drum  containing  an  unspecified quantity  of\n\nhydriodic acid, a fifty-kilogram container of pseudoephedrine slightly\n\nless than half full, and  various other chemicals, glassware,  cooking\n\ndevices, protective gear and gloves.\n\n    At  DEA headquarters,  after  determining that  Barnett  had  been\n\nadvised  of his  Miranda rights,  DEA agent  Boeri engaged  Barnett in\n                        \n\nconversation  about the  methamphetamine  operation.   In response  to\n\nBoeri's questions,  Barnett admitted that he was  the \"chemist,\" indi-\n\ncated that he  had experienced no difficulty  obtaining chemicals, and\n\n                    \n\n     4Barnett contests the district  court ruling that the warrantless\nsearch was consensual.  See infra at pt. II.B.1.\n                                 \n\n                                  8\n\nexplained that his methamphetamine  was \"ninety nine and  one percent\"\n\npure  as a  consequence  of the  two  \"extra\" manufacturing  steps  he\n\nperformed.\n\n    Five  days into their  joint trial,  Jordan pleaded  guilty to all\n\ncounts.    Thereafter,  the  jury  convicted  Barnett,  and  acquitted\n\nFitzgerald, on all counts.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\nA.  Sentencing Issues\n                     \n\n    Barnett and Jordan challenge  the sentencing court's determination\n\nthat  each was responsible  for twenty-nine kilograms  of pure metham-\n\nphetamine.

There was  every indication  that  they had  the\n    materials to produce  this full  amount.  As  such, the  Drug\n    Quantity Table  under [s]ubsection (c), offenses involving at\n    least 10 kilograms but less than 30 kilograms of pure metham-\n    phetamine provides for a base offense level of 40.\n\nAppellants insist that the court  overestimated the capacity of  their\n\ndrug manufacturing operation and that their sentences should have been\n\nbased exclusively on the quantity of methamphetamine seized.\n\n    The sentencing guidelines direct that  a defendant who is convict-\n\ned  of  conspiring or  attempting to  commit  any offense  involving a\n\ncontrolled substance shall be assigned the same base offense level \"as\n\nif  the object  of  the conspiracy  or  attempt had  been  completed.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.4.   Further  guidance is  provided in  an application\n\nnote:\n\n    Where there is no drug seizure  or the amount seized does not\n                                                                 \n    reflect the  scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall\n                                     \n    approximate  the quantity  of the  controlled substance.   In\n    making his  determination, the judge may  consider, for exam-\n    ple,  the price  generally obtained  for the  controlled sub-\n    stance,  financial or other  records, similar transactions in\n    controlled  substances  by the  defendant,  and  the size  or\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     5Appellants mistakenly  suggest that  the court made  no specific\nfinding as  to the quantity  of drugs for  which they were  being held\nresponsible.  The court checked the  box on the \"Statement of Reasons\"\nform  attached  to the  judgment relating  to each  defendant, thereby\nclearly indicating  that \"[t]he  court adopt[ed] the  factual findings\nand  guideline application in  the presentence report.\"   We therefore\nreject their Rule 32(c)(3)(D) claim.\n\n                                  10\n\n    capability of any laboratory involved.\n                                         \n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.4, comment. (n.2) (1991) (emphasis added).\n\n    Three ounces of methamphetamine crystals, and a bucket  containing\n\nan additional  pound of methamphetamine  crystals in two  and one-half\n\npounds  of  liquid, were  seized.   Nevertheless,  the  district court\n\nreasonably concluded  that the quantity of  methamphetamine seized did\n\nnot accurately reflect the  scale of the offense, see  id., especially\n                                                          \n\nin  view of  Jordan's admissions  that his  \"chemist\" had at  hand the\n\ningredients with which to produce forty pounds of methamphetamine, and\n\nin view of the  equipment found in  the trailer and storage  facility,\n\nand the  sizable quantities  of precursor  chemicals seized.   Accord-\n\ningly,  under the sentencing guidelines the district court did not err\n\nin estimating the drug quantity.\n\n    The  court based  its drug-quantity  calculation on the  amount of\n\nmethamphetamine  producible with  fifty kilograms  of pseudoephedrine.\n\nBarnett and  Jordan object to  this calculation because  it disregards\n\nthe  undisputed  fact  that  the fifty-kilogram  drum  contained  only\n\ntwenty-three kilograms of  pseudoephedrine when it was  seized.  More-\n\nover, Jordan insists that the court's approximation of the quantity of\n\nmethamphetamine was flawed because other essential precursor chemicals\n\nwere not  seized  in the  quantities required  to produce  twenty-nine\n\nkilograms of methamphetamine, in particular hydriodic acid.\n\n    In approximating  the producible quantity of controlled substance,\n\nthe  sentencing court may  consider the amount  of precursor chemicals\n\n                                  11\n\npossessed.

See\n                                                                      \n\nSklar, 920 F.2d  at 113.  The base offense  level assigned each appel-\n     \n\nlant  was 40, the level  applicable to offenses  involving between ten\n\nand  thirty kilograms of unadulterated methamphetamine.  A DEA chemist\n\ntestified at trial that fifty kilograms of pseudoephedrine would yield\n\ntwenty-nine kilograms  of methamphetamine.6  Utilizing  the same ratio\n\n                    \n\n     6Jordan points  out  that the  court did  not state  that it  was\nrelying on the DEA chemist's testimony, that the drug quantity approx-\nimation in the PSR is  not attributed to the chemist, and  that Jordan\nhad  no opportunity to cross-examine  the chemist, who testified after\n\n                                  13\n\n   one  unit of pseudoephedrine per  a .58 unit of  methamphetamine   \n\nthe  twenty-three kilograms  of pseudoephedrine  seized in  the fifty-\n\nkilogram drum would yield  approximately thirteen kilograms of metham-\n\nphetamine,  a quantity sufficient to warrant the base offense level of\n\n40.  \n\n    The DEA  chemist further  testified that  the ephedrine  reduction\n\nprocess requires hydriodic acid  in quantities from one to  four times\n\nthe amount of pseudoephedrine, depending upon the particular \"recipe.\"\n\nAlthough the evidence does not establish the exact amount of hydriodic\n\nacid the  defendants possessed, approximately ten  liters were seized,\n\nalong  with an unspecified quantity found in a seventy-pound container\n\nat  the warehouse.  In addition, an empty seventy-pound hydriodic acid\n\ncontainer was found at the trailer.\n\n    Furthermore,  Jordan admitted  to  Agent  Kelly that  he  and  the\n\n\"chemist\" had all the necessary ingredients, with the exception of the\n\nhydriodic acid being  procured from Kelly,  with which to  manufacture\n\nforty pounds (eighteen kilograms) of methamphetamine immediately.

Jordan failed to\n                \npresent any evidence at sentencing to refute the drug-quantity approx-\nimation  in the  PSR.   We discern  no clear  error in  the sentencing\ncourt's reliance on the DEA chemist's trial testimony.\n\n                                  14\n\ngrams of methamphetamine.  Some quantity  of each chemical on the list\n\nwas seized  either from the trailer  or the warehouse and  in the size\n\ncontainer specified on the  list.7  Appellants' PSRs also  contain the\n\nuncontroverted  statements that  Barnett produced  approximately eight\n\npounds of methamphetamine in December 1989 and that Jordan participat-\n\ned in  its distribution.   Neither appellant  presented countervailing\n\ndrug-quantity or chemical-quantity evidence at sentencing.  \n\n    We discern  no clear  error.   The  district court  had before  it\n\nsufficient reliable  information to support a finding that Barnett and\n\nJordan  were actually responsible for  not less than  ten kilograms of\n                                               \n\nmethamphetamine, warranting a base offense level of 40.  \n\n    2.  Drug Purity\n                   \n\n    An explanatory note  appended to the  Drug Quantity  Table distin-\n\n                    \n\n     7The Fitzgerald chemical list reads as follows:\n    d-pseudoephedrine Hcl.\n    50 kilo drum\n    Hydriodic Acid\n    4 - 70 lb drum\n\n    Red Phosphorus\n    15 lb\n    R-IIFreon\n    7 - 100 lb drums\n    Methyl Alchohol [sic]\n    (methanol)\n    5 - 5 gal drums\n    Acetone\n    7 - 5 gal drums\n\nAmong the seized chemicals were a partially filled fifty-kilogram drum\nof pseudoephedrine,  one empty and one  partially filled seventy-pound\nhydriodic acid  drum, several one-pound  bottles of red  phosphorus, a\n100-pound drum  of freon, several five-gallon  containers of methanol,\nand two five-gallon acetone containers.\n\n                                  15\n\nguishes  between  the terms  \"methamphetamine  (actual)\" and  \"metham-\n\nphetamine\":\n\n    Unless otherwise  specified, the weight of  a controlled sub-\n    stance set forth in the table  refers to the entire weight of\n    any mixture  or substance  containing a detectable  amount of\n    the controlled substance . . . .

Now,  for the first\n\ntime, Jordan argues  that the record does not  establish the purity of\n\nthe  methamphetamine for which he  was held responsible,  and that his\n\nbase offense level should  have been computed under the  Drug Quantity\n\nTable entry for adulterated \"methamphetamine\" rather than \"methamphet-\n\namine (actual).\"  \n\n    Issues  not squarely  raised in  the  district  court will  not be\n\nentertained on appeal.

Although  defense counsel\n\nconsistently  referred  to   base  offense  levels   corresponding  to\n\nadulterated \"methamphetamine\" rather than  \"methamphetamine (actual),\"\n\nboth at  sentencing and in  opposition to the PSR,  at no time  did he\n\nexpressly  raise  drug  purity as  an  issue  in  the district  court.\n\n\"Judges  are not expected to be mindreaders.

Absent any  evidence that the  methamphetamine\nwas diluted or  adulterated in  any manner, the  sentencing court  was\npresented with insufficient evidence to sustain Jordan's present drug-\npurity claim.\n\n                                  17\n\nSchneckloth v.

Among the individualized factors bearing on the vulnerability\n\nof the consenting party  are age, education, experience, intelligence,\n\nand  knowledge of the right to withhold consent.

Although sensitivity  to the\n                    \n\nheightened possibility  of coercion is appropriate  when a defendant's\n\nconsent  is obtained during custody, see Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 240,\n                                                    \n\nn.29,  \"custody alone has never  been enough in  itself to demonstrate\n\n. . . coerced . . . consent to search.\"  United States  v.

Immediately  after he was  arrested and handcuffed,\n\nthe  officers  holstered their  weapons  and  advised Barnett  of  his\n\nMiranda  rights.   Barnett was  then asked  if he  would consent  to a\n       \n\n                                  18\n\nsearch of  the premises.9  Barnett  claims that he was  never informed\n\nthat he  could withhold his consent, he was given no consent form, and\n\nhe was led  to believe that the officers already  had a search warrant\n\nbecause they  began searching the premises  immediately upon entering,\n\nprior to requesting consent.\n\n    Written consent is not essential to  the establishment of a  valid\n\nconsensual search.  See, e.g., United States v. Chaidez, 906 F.2d 377,\n                                                       \n\n382 (8th Cir. 1990) (search may be justified by voluntary oral consent\n\neven  in the  absence  of valid  written  consent); United  States  v.\n                                                                  \n\nCastillo,  866 F.2d 1071, 1082 (9th Cir. 1988) (defendant's refusal to\n        \n\nsign a consent  form does  not preclude a  finding of  voluntariness).\n\nMoreover,  it  is not  essential that  the  officers first  inform the\n\nconsenting party of the right to withhold consent, though knowledge of\n\nthe right  to withhold consent is a factor to be considered in assess-\n\ning voluntariness, Schneckloth, 412  U.S. at 227; see also  Florida v.\n                                                                   \n\nRodriguez, 469 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1984).\n         \n\n    Although Barnett testified  that agents began \"searching,  looking\n\nunder  things,\" and  \"opening drawers  and cabinets,\"  Lemon testified\n\n                    \n\n     9Barnett testified  that, following  his arrest, he  was told  by\nAgent Lemon:   \"Mike, we  are just going to  look around and  take you\ndown  to  the Marshfield  Police  Station,  okay?\"   Barnett  replied,\n\"Okay.\"   Barnett contends that he was merely acknowledging his arrest\nand inevitable booking, not  consenting to a search of  his residence.\nBased  on  Agent  Lemon's testimony,  however,  the  court  found that\nBarnett was  asked:  \"Mind if I look around the house?\" and responded,\n\"Go ahead.  You'd probably get a search warrant anyway.\"  The district\ncourt was presented with a pure credibility determination.  We find no\nclear  error in its determination  that Lemon's version  of the events\nwas more credible.\n\n                                  19\n\nthat a protective  sweep was conducted  immediately upon entering  the\n                        \n\npremises to ensure that no one else was present.10 Thereafter,     ac-\n\ncording  to Lemon,  the  agents \"just  [stood]  around\" until  Barnett\n\nconsented  to a further search.   We find no clear  error in the trial\n\ncourt's credibility-based ruling that \"a sweep search was conducted.\"\n\n    Barnett's contention  that the  search conducted immediately  upon\n\nentry led him to believe that the agents already had  a search warrant\n\ncannot  succeed in any event.  The district court expressly found that\n\nBarnett responded as follows to Lemon's request for consent to search:\n\n\"Go  ahead.  You'd probably  get a search  warrant anyway[]\" (emphasis\n                                                         \n\nadded), plainly  implying Barnett's understanding that  the agents had\n\nno search warrant and needed his consent.\n\n    Notwithstanding the  inherently unnerving effect  of having numer-\n\nous  officers arrive  at one's  door with  guns drawn, Barnett  was no\n\n\"newcomer\"  to  law-enforcement  encounters.   See  United  States  v.\n                                                                  \n\nKimball, 741 F.2d 471, 474 (1st Cir. 1984).  Barnett had been convict-\n       \n\ned of  at least eighteen prior offenses and arrested on at least eight\n\nprevious  occasions.  Thus,  we may fairly  presume that  he was \"less\n\nlikely  than most  to be  intimidated by the  agents' show  of force.\"\n\nUnited States v.

The Lemon Affidavit\n                           \n\n    Next, Barnett claims that the district  court erred in refusing to\n\nsuppress  evidence obtained as a result of alleged false statements in\n\nthe  affidavit supporting  the  search warrant  application.   Barnett\n\ncontends that  the  erroneous  heat-imaging test  data  in  the  Lemon\n\naffidavit was materially false or included with reckless disregard for\n\nits truth.  Without it, says Barnett, the Lemon affidavit was insuffi-\n\ncient to establish probable cause to search the trailer.\n\n    The district  court conducted an  evidentiary hearing pursuant  to\n\n                                  21\n\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).  Franks findings are reviewed\n                                                \n\nfor clear error.  United States  v.

The  questions for us are\n                   \n\n(1)  whether Barnett established by a preponderance of the evidence at\n\nthe Franks hearing that the affidavit was perjurious, or prepared with\n          \n\nreckless  disregard for  its  truth, and  (2)  whether the  affidavit,\n                                        \n\nwithout  the false  material, was  insufficient to  establish probable\n\ncause  for the search.  If so, the  warrant was void and the fruits of\n\nthe search must be suppressed.  Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56.  \n                                      \n\n    Barnett claims that  the heat-imaging data Trooper Welby  provided\n\nto Lemon,  see supra at pp. 5-6, was either deliberately or recklessly\n                    \n\nfalse,  because Welby failed to  inform Lemon that  he lacked training\n\nand  experience  in operating  the device  and  failed to  examine the\n\ndevice prior to  the May 30 flyover  to determine which  polarity mode\n\nwas operative.\n\n    The district  court finding that  Welby did  not act in  bad faith\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.  There is no evidence that Welby intention-\n\nally misinterpreted the data from the infrared equipment.  Rather, the\n\nevidence  strongly  suggests,  just as  the  court  found, that  Welby\n\nsincerely believed, albeit  mistakenly, that the equipment was  in the\n\n\"white-hot\" polarity mode during the fly-over.\n\n    Neither  is there evidence  that Lemon  knew that the heat-imaging\n\ndata was incorrect.  Nevertheless, Barnett argues that Lemon's failure\n\nto make note, in the affidavit, that Welby had little  experience with\n\nthe heat-imaging equipment was  a material omission made intentionally\n\n                                  22\n\nor with reckless disregard for the truth.  Although the district court\n\nmade no direct finding on this issue, we need not pursue the matter as\n\nthe affidavit would have been sufficient without the challenged data.\n\n    \"[I]f an  affiant knowingly includes  a false statement  in a\n    warrant affidavit, the warrant  will stand if, 'when material\n    that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disre-\n    gard  is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in\n    the  warrant  affidavit  to  support a  finding  of  probable\n    cause.'\"\n\nUnited States v.

According to\nthe informant, Jordan  and \"Barney\" manufactured ten pounds of metham-\nphetamine in November or December of 1989.\n    (2)   Jordan told  DEA  undercover  agent Kelly  that he  and  his\nchemist had 160 pounds of chemicals, and needed only hydriodic acid to\nmanufacture  forty  pounds of  methamphetamine.    Kelly supplied  the\nhydriodic acid in  exchange for  Jordan's promise to  give Kelly  four\nounces of methamphetamine.\n    (3)  Clandestine  methamphetamine labs typically have air vents or\nducts  to dissipate toxic fumes; photographs of the trailer revealed a\n\"black  bordered area\" which Lemon,  based on his experience, believed\n\n                                  23\n\nruling was not clearly erroneous.\n\nC.  Severance\n             \n\n    Next, Barnett claims that denial of his severance motion  violated\n\nhis  Sixth Amendment right to  confrontation, as a  consequence of the\n\nprejudice occasioned by the admission in evidence, at the joint trial,\n\nof codefendant  Fitzgerald's  post-arrest statements,  see  Bruton  v.\n                                                                  \n\nUnited States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), and that he was further prejudiced\n             \n\nby the testimony of Fitzgerald's spouse, Sheryl.  \n\n    At trial, Agent Lemon testified as follows:\n\n    I  advised Mr. Fitzgerald  that we had  done a search  on the\n    trailer  in his backyard.   I advised Mr.  Fitzgerald that we\n    had found a  speed lab,  a methamphetamine lab.   I told  him\n    that  I believed another person  was the chemist,  and I also\n    told Mr. Fitzgerald  that I  believed he knew  who the  other\n    person was and that  this other person was a  chemist . . . .\n    He told me he knew who this other person was, but that he did\n    not know  that this  person was  involved with  a clandestine\n    laboratory.  He stated that he  knew him or this other person\n    socially and that he would go  out on occasion and have a few\n    drinks with  this other person. . . . Mr.  Fitzgerald told me\n    that he rented the trailer out to this other person and  that\n    it was  used for  construction. . . . Mr. Fitzgerald  told me\n    that  he . . .  did not  know what  was going  on out  in the\n\n                    \n\nto be  a trapdoor or venting area  for a clandestine laboratory inside\nthe trailer.\n    (4)  The  pattern of  electricity consumption suggested the  pres-\nence of  a clandestine lab.   The electricity bills showed  a dramatic\nincrease in December  1989, the  time period during  which Jordan  and\n\"Barney\" manufactured ten pounds of methamphetamine.\n    (5)   During a DEA  flyover on  May 26,  1990, a  DEA agent  first\nobserved a  power cord running between the trailer and the main house.\nDuring a May 28 flyover, two Massachusetts State Troopers observed the\nsame cord.\n    (6)   A DEA agent observed Barnett mixing and straining a \"yellow,\nslushy mixture\" at the trailer on May 30.\n    (7)   The trailer  was located  in a  remote, wooded  location, an\nideal site for a clandestine laboratory.\n\n                                  24\n\nBarnett  objected and moved to strike  on Bruton grounds.12  The court\n                                                \n    trailer, and I then asked Mr. Fitzgerald how he could explain\n\n    what Mr.  Fitzgerald told me was that  he was in the trailer,\n    the  hydrio[d]ic acid label that  was found in  his coat, and\n\n    he saw the bottles  of hydrio[d]ic acid, and that  he removed\n    one of the labels because he wanted to find out what it was.\n\nLemon's testimony  relating his own extrajudicial  statements to Fitz-\n\n                                  25\n     13Although Barnett moved to  strike the \"entire conversation,\" he\ndid so  on Bruton grounds  only.

Appellants  Michael Barnett and  Barry Jordan\n    CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                      \n\nwere charged, in a three-count indictment, with conspiracy to manufac-\n\nture and  possess with intent to distribute  methamphetamine in viola-\n\ntion of 21 U.S.C.   846, possession with intent to distribute  metham-\n\nphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a) (1), and possession of a\n\nlisted  chemical in violation  of 21 U.S.C.    841(d)(1).  Barnett was\n\nconvicted on all three  counts at trial; Jordan pleaded  guilty to all\n\nthree  counts shortly  after  the commencement  of  trial.   Each  was\n\nsentenced  to a thirty-year prison term  and a ten-year term of super-\n\nvised  release.  On appeal,  Barnett raises several  challenges to his\n\nconviction, and  joins Jordan in contesting  the drug-quantity finding\n\nmade by the district court at sentencing.  We affirm.  \n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n    In March  1990, the United  States Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\")\n\nbegan investigating a suspected conspiracy to manufacture and distrib-\n\nute methamphetamine.  Surveillance was initiated at three sites in the\n\nScituate,  Massachusetts area:   the residences of  each appellant and\n\nthe residence of their codefendant, Timothy Fitzgerald.1  \n\n    Approximately a  year before  the investigation  began, a  trailer\n\nstorage  company had  delivered a  forty-foot trailer  to Fitzgerald's\n\n                    \n\n     1Fitzgerald was acquitted at trial.\n\n                                  3\n\nresidence  in  Scituate.   The employee  who  made the  delivery later\n\ntestified that the  recipient of the  trailer, known to him  as \"Tim,\"\n\ninstructed that the trailer be placed as far back as possible into the\n\nwoods  located on  the  property.    Barnett subsequently  rented  the\n\ntrailer from Fitzgerald.\n\n    In  early May, 1990,  undercover DEA  Agent John  Kelly offered to\n\nsell  Jordan hydriodic  acid ostensibly  stolen by  Kelly.2   At their\n\nmeeting, Jordan  explained that his \"chemist\"  had enough pseudoephed-\n\nrine to produce forty  pounds (eighteen kilograms) of methamphetamine,\n\nbut  needed  twenty  pints of  hydriodic  acid  for the  manufacturing\n\nprocess.   During their  tape-recorded conversation, Jordan  agreed to\n\nbuy twenty  pints of hydriodic  acid, and  to provide Kelly  with four\n\nounces of methamphetamine  in return.   Jordan assured  Kelly that  he\n\nwould  receive four  \"uncut\" ounces,  and suggested  that Kelly  could\n\ndouble the volume by  diluting the pure methamphetamine with  an equal\n\namount of \"cut,\" then  sell the resulting  eight ounces for $2,000  an\n\nounce.\n\n    Jordan  described  the methamphetamine  manufacturing  process  to\n\nKelly, explaining  that it  took seven  to  eight days,  and that  his\n\nchemist  produced ten  pounds of  methamphetamine in  each batch.   To\n\nallay  Kelly's concern  about the  danger of  a laboratory  explosion,\n\n                    \n\n     2Hydriodic acid,  a listed chemical, is  essential to methamphet-\namine production  using the \"ephedrine reduction  process,\" which also\nrequires either ephedrine or  pseudoephedrine; red phosphorus may also\nbe used as  a purifying agent.   To convert  the methamphetamine  into\npowder for  distribution,  it is  dissolved  into freon  liquid,  then\nbubbled in hydrogen chloride gas.\n\n                                  4\n\nJordan explained  that his chemist had  been manufacturing methamphet-\n\namine for ten years, and volunteered that he had assisted  the chemist\n\nin preparing eight to ten batches one summer.3\n\n    As promised, on May 16, 1990,  Kelly delivered two boxes  contain-\n\ning  twenty half-liter  bottles (approximately  twenty pints)  of hyd-\n\nriodic  acid to  Jordan.   A different  DEA agent  followed  Jordan to\n\nBarnett's residence,  where he  observed Jordan and  Barnett unloading\n\ntwo boxes from the trunk of Jordan's car.\n\n    The  DEA  conducted a  series  of  aerial  surveillance  fly-overs\n\nduring  May 1990.  A fly-over of  the Fitzgerald residence on or about\n\nMay 27 revealed an electrical  power cord running from the  main house\n\nto the trailer.   (The  ephedrine reduction process  requires a  power\n\nsource to heat the chemicals.)\n\n    Two subsequent  fly-overs of  the Fitzgerald  residence were  con-\n\nducted  using  an infrared  heat-detecting  device  which operates  in\n\neither of two  polarity modes:  \"white-hot\" or  \"black-hot.\"  When the\n\ndevice is in the white-hot mode, objects emitting heat appear white on\n\nan  attached  screen; in  the  black-hot  mode, heat-emitting  objects\n\nappear black.  The  device detected no heat emission  from the trailer\n\nduring a  fly-over on May 28.   On May 30,  Massachusetts State Police\n\n                    \n\n     3After pleading guilty during  trial, Jordan submitted an affida-\nvit  in which he insisted  that these statements  were mere \"puffing,\"\nintended to  convince Kelly that he  was willing and able  to complete\ntheir transaction.   The affidavit  attests that  Jordan knew  nothing\nabout  the manufacture of methamphetamine,  and that his  only role in\nthe  enterprise was to obtain  hydriodic acid in  exchange for a small\namount of money to support his heroin habit.\n\n                                  5\n\nTrooper Richard Welby, who  had relatively little experience  with the\n\ninfrared equipment,  conducted another  fly-over.  Welby,  erroneously\n\nbelieving  the device  was in  the white-hot  mode, observed  that the\n\ntrailer  appeared white  on  the screen,  and  concluded that  it  was\n\nemitting heat.  Subsequent analysis revealed, however, that the device\n\nactually was in the black-hot mode during the May 30 fly-over, and the\n\ninfrared images, properly interpreted,  indicated that the trailer was\n\nemitting no detectible heat.\n\n    On the afternoon  of May 30, a DEA  agent followed Barnett to  the\n\nFitzgerald property.  When Barnett disappeared  down the driveway, the\n\nagent  left his  vehicle and  surreptitiously followed  on foot.   The\n\nagent spotted the  trailer and saw Barnett inside.   The agent noticed\n\nseveral  blue buckets, a white radiator, and  two boxes in the rear of\n\nthe trailer.   As the agent watched, Barnett scraped the bottom of one\n\nof the blue buckets for approximately five minutes, then poured liquid\n\ninto the bucket.  Barnett left the trailer and entered the main house,\n\nreturning  with several paper towels with which he filtered the yellow\n\nslushy contents of the bucket, then poured the filtered substance into\n\na  gray painter's tray.  Barnett made  another trip to the main house,\n\nthis time  returning with clear plastic  sandwich bags.  He  picked up\n\nthe gray painter's tray, rocked it back and forth  several times, then\n\npoured the yellow slushy substance into one of the bags, double-bagged\n\nit, and returned once again to the main house.\n\n    The DEA agent returned  to his vehicle, and  waited for Barnett to\n\ndrive  away.   After  about  twenty-five  minutes,  Barnett  left  the\n\n                                  6\n\nFitzgerald  property and drove to  a shopping center,  unaware that he\n\nwas  being followed  by the  agent.   When the  agent pulled  into the\n\nshopping  center parking lot, he  noticed a second  individual in Bar-\n\nnett's  vehicle.  The agent identified the second individual as appel-\n\nlant Jordan.\n\n    On May 30, DEA Agent Lemon  compiled the information obtained from\n\nthe  various surveillance  operations  (including the  erroneous heat-\n\nimaging  data interpretation) in an affidavit, which he attached to an\n\napplication  for a  warrant to  search the  trailer on  the Fitzgerald\n\nproperty,  the  Fitzgerald  and  Jordan residences,  and  a  residence\n\nbelieved to be occupied by Barnett.\n\n    The  investigation culminated  early  the next  morning  when  the\n\nsearch warrants were executed.  First, agents searched the  Fitzgerald\n\ntrailer,  unveiling a  partially  assembled laboratory  containing  an\n\narray  of chemicals,  including  hydriodic acid,  acetone, freon,  and\n\nhydrogen chloride gas,  and an assortment of equipment associated with\n\nmethamphetamine  production,  including  a radiator,  a  fan,  flasks,\n\ntubes, and a heater-timer.   Three ounces of methamphetamine  crystals\n\nand  a bucket  containing approximately  one pound  of methamphetamine\n\ncrystals  in two and one-half pounds of an acetone/freon solution were\n\nalso discovered.  Subsequent  analysis determined that the methamphet-\n\namine found in the bucket was between 90 and 100 percent pure.\n\n    DEA  agents arrested  Jordan and  Fitzgerald at  their  respective\n\nresidences.   At Jordan's residence, agents seized a small quantity of\n\na mixture containing heroin  and methamphetamine, as well as  a valium\n\n                                  7\n\ntablet,  several hypodermic needles, and several publications describ-\n\ning  the  methamphetamine  manufacturing  process.    At  Fitzgerald's\n\nresidence, agents found a piece of paper listing the chemical ingredi-\n\nents needed  to produce methamphetamine using  the ephedrine reduction\n\nprocess (\"the Fitzgerald chemical list\").\n\n    Barnett no  longer resided at the  residence for  which the fourth\n\nsearch warrant had been obtained.  When DEA agents arrested Barnett at\n\nhis new residence, he was  advised of his Miranda rights and  that the\n                                                 \n\nlaboratory  had been  discovered at  the Fitzgerald property.   Agents\n\nsearched  Barnett's new  residence,4  and discovered  a warehouse  re-\n\nceipt.   In response to a question from Agent Lemon about the receipt,\n\nBarnett  revealed that the remaining equipment and chemicals were in a\n\nstorage bin at the warehouse.  A warrant was secured and the search of\n\nthe storage bin uncovered approximately fifteen pounds of red phospho-\n\nrous,  a  seventy-pound drum  containing  an  unspecified quantity  of\n\nhydriodic acid, a fifty-kilogram container of pseudoephedrine slightly\n\nless than half full, and  various other chemicals, glassware,  cooking\n\ndevices, protective gear and gloves.\n\n    At  DEA headquarters,  after  determining that  Barnett  had  been\n\nadvised  of his  Miranda rights,  DEA agent  Boeri engaged  Barnett in\n                        \n\nconversation  about the  methamphetamine  operation.   In response  to\n\nBoeri's questions,  Barnett admitted that he was  the \"chemist,\" indi-\n\ncated that he  had experienced no difficulty  obtaining chemicals, and\n\n                    \n\n     4Barnett contests the district  court ruling that the warrantless\nsearch was consensual.  See infra at pt. II.B.1.\n                                 \n\n                                  8\n\nexplained that his methamphetamine  was \"ninety nine and  one percent\"\n\npure  as a  consequence  of the  two  \"extra\" manufacturing  steps  he\n\nperformed.\n\n    Five  days into their  joint trial,  Jordan pleaded  guilty to all\n\ncounts.    Thereafter,  the  jury  convicted  Barnett,  and  acquitted\n\nFitzgerald, on all counts.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\nA.  Sentencing Issues\n                     \n\n    Barnett and Jordan challenge  the sentencing court's determination\n\nthat  each was responsible  for twenty-nine kilograms  of pure metham-\n\nphetamine.

There was  every indication  that  they had  the\n    materials to produce  this full  amount.  As  such, the  Drug\n    Quantity Table  under [s]ubsection (c), offenses involving at\n    least 10 kilograms but less than 30 kilograms of pure metham-\n    phetamine provides for a base offense level of 40.\n\nAppellants insist that the court  overestimated the capacity of  their\n\ndrug manufacturing operation and that their sentences should have been\n\nbased exclusively on the quantity of methamphetamine seized.\n\n    The sentencing guidelines direct that  a defendant who is convict-\n\ned  of  conspiring or  attempting to  commit  any offense  involving a\n\ncontrolled substance shall be assigned the same base offense level \"as\n\nif  the object  of  the conspiracy  or  attempt had  been  completed.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.4.   Further  guidance is  provided in  an application\n\nnote:\n\n    Where there is no drug seizure  or the amount seized does not\n                                                                 \n    reflect the  scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall\n                                     \n    approximate  the quantity  of the  controlled substance.   In\n    making his  determination, the judge may  consider, for exam-\n    ple,  the price  generally obtained  for the  controlled sub-\n    stance,  financial or other  records, similar transactions in\n    controlled  substances  by the  defendant,  and  the size  or\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     5Appellants mistakenly  suggest that  the court made  no specific\nfinding as  to the quantity  of drugs for  which they were  being held\nresponsible.  The court checked the  box on the \"Statement of Reasons\"\nform  attached  to the  judgment relating  to each  defendant, thereby\nclearly indicating  that \"[t]he  court adopt[ed] the  factual findings\nand  guideline application in  the presentence report.\"   We therefore\nreject their Rule 32(c)(3)(D) claim.\n\n                                  10\n\n    capability of any laboratory involved.\n                                         \n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.4, comment. (n.2) (1991) (emphasis added).\n\n    Three ounces of methamphetamine crystals, and a bucket  containing\n\nan additional  pound of methamphetamine  crystals in two  and one-half\n\npounds  of  liquid, were  seized.   Nevertheless,  the  district court\n\nreasonably concluded  that the quantity of  methamphetamine seized did\n\nnot accurately reflect the  scale of the offense, see  id., especially\n                                                          \n\nin  view of  Jordan's admissions  that his  \"chemist\" had at  hand the\n\ningredients with which to produce forty pounds of methamphetamine, and\n\nin view of the  equipment found in  the trailer and storage  facility,\n\nand the  sizable quantities  of precursor  chemicals seized.   Accord-\n\ningly,  under the sentencing guidelines the district court did not err\n\nin estimating the drug quantity.\n\n    The  court based  its drug-quantity  calculation on the  amount of\n\nmethamphetamine  producible with  fifty kilograms  of pseudoephedrine.\n\nBarnett and  Jordan object to  this calculation because  it disregards\n\nthe  undisputed  fact  that  the fifty-kilogram  drum  contained  only\n\ntwenty-three kilograms of  pseudoephedrine when it was  seized.  More-\n\nover, Jordan insists that the court's approximation of the quantity of\n\nmethamphetamine was flawed because other essential precursor chemicals\n\nwere not  seized  in the  quantities required  to produce  twenty-nine\n\nkilograms of methamphetamine, in particular hydriodic acid.\n\n    In approximating  the producible quantity of controlled substance,\n\nthe  sentencing court may  consider the amount  of precursor chemicals\n\n                                  11\n\npossessed.

In addition, an empty seventy-pound hydriodic acid\n\ncontainer was found at the trailer.\n\n    Furthermore,  Jordan admitted  to  Agent  Kelly that  he  and  the\n\n\"chemist\" had all the necessary ingredients, with the exception of the\n\nhydriodic acid being  procured from Kelly,  with which to  manufacture\n\nforty pounds (eighteen kilograms) of methamphetamine immediately.

Jordan failed to\n                \npresent any evidence at sentencing to refute the drug-quantity approx-\nimation  in the  PSR.   We discern  no clear  error in  the sentencing\ncourt's reliance on the DEA chemist's trial testimony.\n\n                                  14\n\ngrams of methamphetamine.

Neither appellant  presented countervailing\n\ndrug-quantity or chemical-quantity evidence at sentencing.  \n\n    We discern  no clear  error.

Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56.  \n                                      \n\n    Barnett claims that  the heat-imaging data Trooper Welby  provided\n\nto Lemon,  see supra at pp. 5-6, was either deliberately or recklessly\n                    \n\nfalse,  because Welby failed to  inform Lemon that  he lacked training\n\nand  experience  in operating  the device  and  failed to  examine the\n\ndevice prior to  the May 30 flyover  to determine which  polarity mode\n\nwas operative.\n\n    The district  court finding that  Welby did  not act in  bad faith\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.  There is no evidence that Welby intention-\n\nally misinterpreted the data from the infrared equipment.  Rather, the\n\nevidence  strongly  suggests,  just as  the  court  found, that  Welby\n\nsincerely believed, albeit  mistakenly, that the equipment was  in the\n\n\"white-hot\" polarity mode during the fly-over.\n\n    Neither  is there evidence  that Lemon  knew that the heat-imaging\n\ndata was incorrect.  Nevertheless, Barnett argues that Lemon's failure\n\nto make note, in the affidavit, that Welby had little  experience with\n\nthe heat-imaging equipment was  a material omission made intentionally\n\n                                  22\n\nor with reckless disregard for the truth.  Although the district court\n\nmade no direct finding on this issue, we need not pursue the matter as\n\nthe affidavit would have been sufficient without the challenged data.\n\n    \"[I]f an  affiant knowingly includes  a false statement  in a\n    warrant affidavit, the warrant  will stand if, 'when material\n    that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disre-\n    gard  is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in\n    the  warrant  affidavit  to  support a  finding  of  probable\n    cause.'\"\n\nUnited States v.

According to\nthe informant, Jordan  and \"Barney\" manufactured ten pounds of metham-\nphetamine in November or December of 1989.\n    (2)   Jordan told  DEA  undercover  agent Kelly  that he  and  his\nchemist had 160 pounds of chemicals, and needed only hydriodic acid to\nmanufacture  forty  pounds of  methamphetamine.    Kelly supplied  the\nhydriodic acid in  exchange for  Jordan's promise to  give Kelly  four\nounces of methamphetamine.\n    (3)  Clandestine  methamphetamine labs typically have air vents or\nducts  to dissipate toxic fumes; photographs of the trailer revealed a\n\"black  bordered area\" which Lemon,  based on his experience, believed\n\n                                  23\n\nruling was not clearly erroneous.\n\nC.

I advised Mr.  Fitzgerald that we\n    had found a  speed lab,  a methamphetamine lab.   I told  him\n    that  I believed another person  was the chemist,  and I also\n    told Mr. Fitzgerald  that I  believed he knew  who the  other\n    person was and that  this other person was a  chemist . . . .\n    He told me he knew who this other person was, but that he did\n    not know  that this  person was  involved with  a clandestine\n    laboratory.  He stated that he  knew him or this other person\n    socially and that he would go  out on occasion and have a few\n    drinks with  this other person. . . . Mr.  Fitzgerald told me\n    that he rented the trailer out to this other person and  that\n    it was  used for  construction. . . . Mr. Fitzgerald  told me\n    that  he . . .  did not  know what  was going  on out  in the\n\n                    \n\nto be  a trapdoor or venting area  for a clandestine laboratory inside\nthe trailer.\n    (4)  The  pattern of  electricity consumption suggested the  pres-\nence of  a clandestine lab.   The electricity bills showed  a dramatic\nincrease in December  1989, the  time period during  which Jordan  and\n\"Barney\" manufactured ten pounds of methamphetamine.\n    (5)   During a DEA  flyover on  May 26,  1990, a  DEA agent  first\nobserved a  power cord running between the trailer and the main house.\nDuring a May 28 flyover, two Massachusetts State Troopers observed the\nsame cord.\n    (6)   A DEA agent observed Barnett mixing and straining a \"yellow,\nslushy mixture\" at the trailer on May 30.\n    (7)   The trailer  was located  in a  remote, wooded  location, an\nideal site for a clandestine laboratory.\n\n                                  24\n\nBarnett  objected and moved to strike  on Bruton grounds.12  The court\n                                                \n    trailer, and I then asked Mr. Fitzgerald how he could explain\n\n    what Mr.  Fitzgerald told me was that  he was in the trailer,\n    the  hydrio[d]ic acid label that  was found in  his coat, and\n\n    he saw the bottles  of hydrio[d]ic acid, and that  he removed\n    one of the labels because he wanted to find out what it was.\n\nLemon's testimony  relating his own extrajudicial  statements to Fitz-\n\n                                  25\n     13Although Barnett moved to  strike the \"entire conversation,\" he\ndid so  on Bruton grounds  only.

We find no due process violation.\n\n    Because drug conspiracies are  notoriously difficult to penetrate,\n\ncourts  consistently have  allowed greater  government  involvement in\n\ndrug-crime investigations.

Jordan told Agent Kelly that  Barnett had been\n\nproducing methamphetamine for ten years.  Other evidence revealed that\n\nJordan and Barnett  had manufactured  eight to ten  pounds of  metham-\n\nphetamine  in 1989.   The sale  of hydriodic  acid to  Jordan in these\n\ncircumstances was a permissible investigative effort to infiltrate the\n\nsuspected drug-related conspiracy.
