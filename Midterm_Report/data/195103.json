Defendant Pedro\n                                            \n\n   Arismendy Olivier-Diaz appeals from the sentence he received\n\n   after  he was found guilty  of conspiracy to possess cocaine\n\n   with  intent to  distribute  and  aiding  and  abetting  the\n\n   distribution of  cocaine.  See  21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 841\n                                 \n\n   (b)(1)(c), 846, and 18 U.S.C.    2. Arismendy challenges his\n\n   sentence  on  two grounds.    First,  he  contends that  the\n\n   district  court erred in calculating his offense level under\n\n   the federal sentencing guidelines when it (1) relied on  the\n\n   testimony of an allegedly untrustworthy witness to determine\n\n   the amount  of cocaine involved  in the  conspiracy and  (2)\n\n   concluded on the  basis of inadequate evidence that he acted\n\n   as an organizer or leader  of a criminal activity  involving\n\n   five or more participants.   Second, he claims for the first\n\n   time on appeal that  the court engaged in  \"double counting\"\n\n   when it  increased his  criminal history  category by  using\n\n   prior   convictions  that   allegedly   resulted  from   the\n\n   conspiracy on which his federal sentence was based.  Finding\n\n   no reversible error,  we affirm Arismendy's sentence  in all\n\n   respects.\n\n                                I.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\nA.  The Offenses\n                \n\n                  During  the  fall  of 1990,  Arismendy  met  Ramon\n\nVerona, a small-time drug dealer,  and offered to sell him cocaine.\n\n                                 2\n\nVerona initially declined.   However, he later  contacted Arismendy\n\non two occasions and purchased 125 grams of cocaine on credit.  Two\n\nor   three  months  later,   Arismendy  persuaded  Verona   and  an\n\nunidentified  woman  to  make  several  trips  from   New  York  to\n\nMassachusetts  to transport cocaine.  Once in Massachusetts, Verona\n\nand  the  courier  delivered  the  cocaine   to  a  confederate  of\n\nArismendy's whom  Verona knew only  as \"Giovanni.\"  For  each trip,\n\nVerona  was paid $500  and supplied  with 125  grams of  cocaine on\n\ncredit.\n\n                  Verona   used  the   cocaine  he   obtained   from\n\nArismendy to supply three of his customers in Maine, Peter Lauzier,\n\nVicki  Hall and  Pauline Rivard.   Because  Verona ran  the cocaine\n\noperation  on credit,  however, debt  collection  quickly became  a\n\nsignificant problem.  By May 1991, Rivard owed Verona approximately\n\n$16,000  for  \"fronted\"  cocaine,  $4,000  of  which  was  owed  to\n\nArismendy.   Arismendy's solution  to this problem  was to  recruit\n\nVerona's paramour,  Argentina Dalmassi,  and three  men, to  travel\n\nwith him to Maine to collect the debt.   On June 2, 1991, the group\n\narrived  at  Rivard's  home and  confronted  her  boyfriend, Robert\n\nPelletier.   When Pelletier  informed them that  Rivard was  not at\n\nhome, Arismendy and the three  men ransacked the house, taking some\n\ncash and  some jewelry.   As they were leaving,  Arismendy proposed\n\nthat he take possession  of Pelletier's boat and provide  Pelletier\n\nwith cocaine to sell until he paid back what Rivard owed.\n\n                  Later  that day, Arismendy encountered Rivard at a\n\nnearby flower  shop and  demanded payment.   Although  she believed\n\n                                 3\n\nthat  she  only  owed  money  to Verona,  Rivard  promised  to  pay\n\nArismendy the next day.  Moments later, Dalmassi  appeared, slapped\n\nRivard  in the  face and  demanded immediate  payment.   Arismendy,\n\nhowever,  ordered Dalmassi  to leave.   The  group was  arrested on\n\ncharges  related  to  this collection  attempt  but  they  were all\n\nreleased on bail later  that day.  Fearing for her  safety when she\n\nlearned  of  their release,  Rivard  went  to  the authorities  and\n\noffered to cooperate.\n\n                  In  July 1991,  Arismendy, unbeknownst  to Verona,\n\nbegan distributing cocaine  directly to Lauzier and Hall.   For the\n\nnext several months, Arismendy supplied them with two to ten ounces\n\nof  cocaine  every  other  week.   In  early  October,  a  customer\n\ncontacted  Lauzier and  Hall and  asked  to purchase  cocaine.   In\n\nresponse, Lauzier and Hall went to a trailer owned by their friend,\n\nElwin Baker, weighed the cocaine in Arismendy's presence, and drove\n\nto a  local bar to make the sale.   They were immediately arrested,\n\nhowever, because their  customer sold the cocaine  to an undercover\n\nofficer of the  Maine Bureau of Intergovernmental  Drug Enforcement\n\n(MBIDE).   Arismendy, who  was waiting to be  paid for the cocaine,\n\nbecame concerned  after Lauzier and  Hall failed to return,  and he\n\nsent Baker  out to search  for them.   When Arismendy  learned that\n\nthey had been arrested, he had Baker  drive him back to his home in\n\nNew York.   Arismendy later placed  Baker in charge  of Lauzier and\n\nHall's business and sold him as much  as eight ounces of cocaine at\n\na time. \n\n                                 4\n\n                  Arismendy  was arrested  by the  MBIDE  in January\n\n1992 and was subsequently convicted of the present  federal charges\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Maine.\n\n                                 5\n\nB.  The Sentence\n                \n\n                  The court  held a sentencing  hearing on  February\n\n26, 1993.  Verona was called as a witness at the  hearing and cross\n\nexamined by the defense in an effort to attack his trial testimony.\n\nDuring this examination, Verona testified that he had made at least\n\nfour  trips  from  New York  to  Massachusetts,  transporting seven\n\nkilograms  of  cocaine on  the  first  trip,  and added,  \"I  don't\n\nremember  well,  but  I  think  the other  [trips]  were  about  10\n\nkilograms each.\"   This testimony differed slightly  from his trial\n\ntestimony where he had claimed that he had made \"five or six trips\"\n\nand had delivered seven kilograms of cocaine on the first two trips\n\nand ten kilograms on each remaining trip.\n\n                  In  determining Arismendy's  total offense  level,\n\nthe district court first grouped  the two counts on which Arismendy\n\nhad  been convicted,  see U.S.S.G.     3D1.2(d), and  set his  base\n                         \n\noffense level  at  34 because  it  found that  Arismendy's  conduct\n\ninvolved approximately  36 kilograms  of cocaine.   See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                       \n\n2D1.1(c)(5)  (Drug Quantity Table) (establishing base offense level\n\n34 for conduct involving \"[a]t  least 15 KG but less than 50  KG of\n\nCocaine\").    The court  then  found  that  Arismendy had  been  an\n\norganizer or leader  of a criminal activity involving  five or more\n\nparticipants and added four levels to his base offense  level.  See\n                                                                   \n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a).   Finally, because Arismendy had received  two\n\nfirearms  as  partial  payment  for  cocaine,  the  court  made  an\n\nadditional two-level increase to his offense level.  See U.S.S.G.  \n                                                        \n\n                                 6\n\n2D1.1(b)(1).  These calculations resulted  in a total offense level\n\nof 40.  \n\n                  The   court  then  placed  Arismendy  in  criminal\n\nhistory category  II  by assigning  one criminal  history point  to\n\nprior State of Maine convictions for theft and criminal threatening\n\nand a second  point to  a prior  State of New  York conviction  for\n\noperating a motor vehicle while  impaired by alcohol.  See U.S.S.G.\n                                                          \n\n   4A1.1(c).    Accordingly,   the  court  determined   Arismendy's\n\nguideline sentencing  range to be  324-405 months.  The  court then\n\nsentenced  Arismendy  to  365  months  in  prison,  five  years  of\n\nsupervised release and a $5,000 fine.  This appeal followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n                           DISCUSSION\n\nA.  The Offense Level\n                     \n\n                 Arismendy  challenges  two steps  in  the  district\n\ncourt's offense level computation.  We consider his claims \"mindful\n\nthat we  must both  'accept the  findings of  fact of the  district\n\ncourt unless they are clearly erroneous' and 'give due deference to\n\nthe district court's application of the guidelines to  the facts.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499,  507 (1st Cir. 1990)  (quoting\n                     \n\n18 U.S.C.\n\n  3742(e)).\n\n     1.  Cocaine Quantity\n                         \n\n                  Arismendy's first argument is that the  sentencing\n\ncourt erroneously relied  on Verona's testimony in  determining the\n\n                                 7\n\namount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy because Verona offered\n\nuncorroborated  and self-contradictory  testimony in  an effort  to\n\nreceive favorable treatment  from the government.   We reject  this\n\ncontention. \n\n                  Arismendy's counsel forthrightly conceded at  oral\n\nargument that if Verona's testimony were  believed, his claim would\n\ncollapse.   Given  this concession,  we  easily conclude  that  the\n\ndistrict court did not err in its drug quantity determination.  The\n\nrecord  shows unequivocally that after considering the evidence and\n\nrejecting the same arguments now  raised on appeal, the court found\n\nVerona's testimony to be credible.  In the absence  of clear error,\n\nsuch  assessments  are  exclusively  within  the  province  of  the\n\nsentencing court.   We  find no such  error here.   Cf. id.  at 508\n                                                           \n\n(\"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances,\n\nthe sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot\n\nbe clearly erroneous\").  \n\n             2.  Leadership Role\n                                \n\n                 Arismendy  next  claims  that  the  district  court\n\ncommitted clear error  when it increased his offense  level by four\n\nlevels because  of his alleged  leadership role in  the conspiracy.\n\nSee  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(a).   He contends  that the  enhancement was\n   \n\nimproper because the evidence established only that  he acted alone\n\nin  selling  cocaine  to multiple  \"independent  customers.\"     We\n\ndisagree.\n\n                  Two  conditions  must be  met before  a leadership\n\nrole enhancement is in order under U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a).  See United\n                                                                   \n\n                                 8\n\nStates v.  Preakos, 907  F.2d 7,  9 (1st Cir.  1990) (per  curiam).\n                  \n\nFirst, the sentencing  court must find that the  defendant acted as\n\n\"an  organizer or  leader of  a  criminal activity.\"   Second,  the\n\nactivity must  have  \"involved five  or  more participants  or  was\n\notherwise extensive.\"   See   United States  v. McDowell,  918 F.2d\n                                                        \n\n1004, 1011 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a)).  \n\n                  In   determining  whether   a  defendant   had   a\n\nleadership role  in criminal  activity, the  commentary to  section\n\n3B1.1 instructs courts to consider such factors as decision  making\n\nauthority, recruitment  of accomplices, degree of  participation in\n\nplanning the offense, degree of  control over others, and a claimed\n\nright to  a larger share  of the fruits  of the crime.   U.S.S.G.  \n\n3B1.1, comment.  (n.4); see also Preakos,  907 F.2d at 9.   Because\n                                        \n\nsuch  \"role  in  the offense\"  assessments  are  fact-specific, the\n\ndistrict  court's views  must be  accorded  \"considerable respect.\"\n\nSee United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                           \n\n                 The  instant  record  amply  supports  the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Arismendy was an organizer or leader of the\n\ndrug  distribution conspiracy.   The  court  could reasonably  have\n\ninferred  from the  trial evidence  that  Arismendy: (1)  initiated\n\ncocaine discussions with  Verona; (2) convinced Lauzier and Hall to\n\nwork with him; (3) attempted  to persuade Pelletier to sell cocaine\n\nfor  him; (4)  actively  supervised the  collection  of debts;  (5)\n\ninstructed Baker to take over the Maine distribution business after\n\nLauzier and Hall were arrested; and (6) exercised a high  degree of\n\ndecision making  authority  both in  organizing the  multi-kilogram\n\n                                 9\n\ncocaine shipments from  New York to Massachusetts  and in directing\n\nand coordinating  Verona  and  the  female courier.    Given  these\n\npermissible  inferences, the  court was  not  clearly erroneous  in\n\nfinding that Arismendy  was an organizer or leader  of the criminal\n\nactivity.    Cf.,  e.g.,  Preakos,  907  F.2d  at  9-10  (upholding\n                                 \n\nenhancement where defendant, among other things, \"exercised control\n\nover his distributors, at  least in the sense that he directed them\n\nwith  regard to  their role  in the  various cocaine  shipments and\n\napparently coordinated aspects of the distribution\").\n\n                  The  district  court  also  could  have  plausibly\n\nconcluded  from the  record  that five  or  more participants  were\n\ninvolved   in  Arismendy's  criminal  activity.      Under  section\n\n3B1.1(a), a \"participant\"  is any person, including  the defendant,\n\nwho is \"criminally responsible for  the commission of the offense .\n\n. . .\" See U.S.S.G.   3B1.1,  comment. (n.l); see also Preakos, 907\n                                                              \n\nF.2d at  10 (defendant included  as a participant under  U.S.S.G.  \n\n3B1.1(a)).  Even without counting the persons Arismendy claims were\n\nmerely  customers,  at  least  five  others,  including  Arismendy,\n\nVerona, the female courier, Giovanni,  and one or more of the  four\n\ndebt collectors, could reasonably have been considered participants\n\nin Arismendy's criminal activity.  Thus,  we find no clear error in\n\nthe sentencing court's determination. \n\nB.  The Criminal History Category\n                                 \n\n                  Arismendy's final contention is that the  district\n\ncourt  engaged in  \"double counting\"  when  it used  the theft  and\n\n                                 10\n\ncriminal  threatening  convictions   --  which,  appellant  claims,\n\nresulted  from his June 1991, collection  attempt against Rivard --\n\nto increase his  criminal history category.    Arismendy bases this\n\nclaim on section 4A1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines, which provides that\n\nin computing a defendant's criminal history, a court may count only\n\nsentences that were \"previously imposed . . . for conduct not  part\n\nof the  instant offense.\"   He contends  that because the theft and\n\ncriminal  threatening convictions  resulted from  conduct  that was\n\npart of the federal drug distribution conspiracy, these convictions\n\ncannot be  used to increase  his criminal history category.   Since\n\nArismendy  did not  raise this  claim  in the  district court,  his\n\nsentence  can be  reversed on  this basis  only  upon a  showing of\n\n\"plain error.\"  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).   He has failed to make\n                   \n\nsuch a showing here.\n\n                  Three  criteria   restrict  a  reviewing   court's\n\nauthority to reverse a sentence under the plain error rule.

See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), 846, and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.  Arismendy challenges his sentence on two grounds.  First, he contends that the district court erred in calculating his offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines when it (1) relied on the testimony of an allegedly untrustworthy witness to determine the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy and (2) concluded on the basis of inadequate evidence that he acted as an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants.  Second, he claims for the first time on appeal that the court engaged in \"double counting\" when it increased his criminal history category by using prior convictions that allegedly resulted from the conspiracy on which his federal sentence was based.  Finding no reversible error, we affirm Arismendy's sentence in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. The Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall of 1990, Arismendy met Ramon Verona, a small-time drug dealer, and offered to sell him cocaine.  Verona initially declined.  However, he later contacted Arismendy on two occasions and purchased 125 grams of cocaine on credit.  Two or three months later, Arismendy persuaded Verona and an unidentified woman to make several trips from New York to Massachusetts to transport cocaine.  Once in Massachusetts, Verona and the courier delivered the cocaine to a confederate of Arismendy's whom Verona knew only as \"Giovanni.\"   For each trip, Verona was paid $500 and supplied with 125 grams of cocaine on credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verona used the cocaine he obtained from Arismendy to supply three of his customers in Maine, Peter Lauzier, Vicki Hall and Pauline Rivard.  Because Verona ran the cocaine operation on credit, however, debt collection quickly became a significant problem.  By May 1991, Rivard owed Verona approximately $16,000 for \"fronted\" cocaine, $4,000 of which was owed to Arismendy.  Arismendy's solution to this problem was to recruit Verona's paramour, Argentina Dalmassi, and three men, to travel with him to Maine to collect the debt.  On June 2, 1991, the group arrived at Rivard's home and confronted her boyfriend, Robert Pelletier.  When Pelletier informed them that Rivard was not at home, Arismendy and the three men ransacked the house, taking some cash and some jewelry.  As they were leaving, Arismendy proposed that he take possession of Pelletier's boat and provide Pelletier with cocaine to sell until he paid back what Rivard owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Arismendy encountered Rivard at a nearby flower shop and demanded payment.  Although she believed that she only owed money to Verona, Rivard promised to pay Arismendy the next day.  Moments later, Dalmassi appeared, slapped Rivard in the face and demanded immediate payment.  Arismendy, however, ordered Dalmassi to leave.  The group was arrested on charges related to this collection attempt but they were all released on bail later that day.  Fearing for her safety when she learned of their release, Rivard went to the authorities and offered to cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1991, Arismendy, unbeknownst to Verona, began distributing cocaine directly to Lauzier and Hall.  For the next several months, Arismendy supplied them with two to ten ounces of cocaine every other week.  In early October, a customer contacted Lauzier and Hall and asked to purchase cocaine.  In response, Lauzier and Hall went to a trailer owned by their friend, Elwin Baker, weighed the cocaine in Arismendy's presence, and drove to a local bar to make the sale.  They were immediately arrested, however, because their customer sold the cocaine to an undercover officer of the Maine Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement (MBIDE).  Arismendy, who was waiting to be paid for the cocaine, became concerned after Lauzier and Hall failed to return, and he sent Baker out to search for them.  When Arismendy learned that they had been arrested, he had Baker drive him back to his home in New York.  Arismendy later placed Baker in charge of Lauzier and Hall's business and sold him as much as eight ounces of cocaine at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy was arrested by the MBIDE in January 1992 and was subsequently convicted of the present federal charges in the United States District Court for the District of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a sentencing hearing on February 26, 1993.  Verona was called as a witness at the hearing and cross examined by the defense in an effort to attack his trial testimony.  During this examination, Verona testified that he had made at least four trips from New York to Massachusetts, transporting seven kilograms of cocaine on the first trip, and added, \"I don't remember well, but I think the other [trips] were about 10 kilograms each.\"   This testimony differed slightly from his trial testimony where he had claimed that he had made \"five or six trips\" and had delivered seven kilograms of cocaine on the first two trips and ten kilograms on each remaining trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining Arismendy's total offense level, the district court first grouped the two counts on which Arismendy had been convicted, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3D1.2(d), and set his base offense level at 34 because it found that Arismendy's conduct involved approximately 36 kilograms of cocaine.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5) (Drug Quantity Table) (establishing base offense level 34 for conduct involving \"[a]t least 15 KG but less than 50 KG of Cocaine\").  The court then found that Arismendy had been an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants and added four levels to his base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  Finally, because Arismendy had received two firearms as partial payment for cocaine, the court made an additional two-level increase to his offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1).  These calculations resulted in a total offense level of 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then placed Arismendy in criminal history category II by assigning one criminal history point to prior State of Maine convictions for theft and criminal threatening and a second point to a prior State of New York conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c).  Accordingly, the court determined Arismendy's guideline sentencing range to be 324-405 months.  The court then sentenced Arismendy to 365 months in prison, five years of supervised release and a $5,000 fine.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Offense Level</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy challenges two steps in the district court's offense level computation.  We consider his claims \"mindful that we must both 'accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous' and 'give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.' \"  United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Cocaine Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's first argument is that the sentencing court erroneously relied on Verona's testimony in determining the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy because Verona offered uncorroborated and self-contradictory testimony in an effort to receive favorable treatment from the government.  We reject this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's counsel forthrightly conceded at oral argument that if Verona's testimony were believed, his claim would collapse.  Given this concession, we easily conclude that the district court did not err in its drug quantity determination.  The record shows unequivocally that after considering the evidence and rejecting the same arguments now raised on appeal, the court found Verona's testimony to be credible.  In the absence of clear error, such assessments are exclusively within the province of the sentencing court.  We find no such error here.  Cf. id. at 508 (\"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Leadership Role</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy next claims that the district court committed clear error when it increased his offense level by four levels because of his alleged leadership role in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  He contends that the enhancement was improper because the evidence established only that he acted alone in selling cocaine to multiple \"independent customers.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conditions must be met before a leadership role enhancement is in order under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  See United States v. Preakos, 907 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam).  First, the sentencing court must find that the defendant acted as \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity.\"   Second, the activity must have \"involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   See United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1011 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a defendant had a leadership role in criminal activity, the commentary to section 3B1.1 instructs courts to consider such factors as decision making authority, recruitment of accomplices, degree of participation in planning the offense, degree of control over others, and a claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, comment.  (n. 4);  see also Preakos, 907 F.2d at 9.   Because such \"role in the offense\" assessments are fact-specific, the district court's views must be accorded \"considerable respect.\"   See United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant record amply supports the district court's conclusion that Arismendy was an organizer or leader of the drug distribution conspiracy.  The court could reasonably have inferred from the trial evidence that Arismendy:  (1) initiated cocaine discussions with Verona;  (2) convinced Lauzier and Hall to work with him;  (3) attempted to persuade Pelletier to sell cocaine for him;  (4) actively supervised the collection of debts;  (5) instructed Baker to take over the Maine distribution business after Lauzier and Hall were arrested;  and (6) exercised a high degree of decision making authority both in organizing the multi-kilogram cocaine shipments from New York to Massachusetts and in directing and coordinating Verona and the female courier.  Given these permissible inferences, the court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Arismendy was an organizer or leader of the criminal activity.  Cf., e.g., Preakos, 907 F.2d at 9-10 (upholding enhancement where defendant, among other things, \"exercised control over his distributors, at least in the sense that he directed them with regard to their role in the various cocaine shipments and apparently coordinated aspects of the distribution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also could have plausibly concluded from the record that five or more participants were involved in Arismendy's criminal activity.  Under section 3B1.1(a), a \"participant\" is any person, including the defendant, who is \"criminally responsible for the commission of the offense....\"  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, comment.  (n. 1);  see also Preakos, 907 F.2d at 10 (defendant included as a participant under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a)).  Even without counting the persons Arismendy claims were merely customers, at least five others, including Arismendy, Verona, the female courier, Giovanni, and one or more of the four debt collectors, could reasonably have been considered participants in Arismendy's criminal activity.  Thus, we find no clear error in the sentencing court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Criminal History Category</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's final contention is that the district court engaged in \"double counting\" when it used the theft and criminal threatening convictions--which, appellant claims, resulted from his June 1991, collection attempt against Rivard--to increase his criminal history category.  Arismendy bases this claim on section 4A1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines, which provides that in computing a defendant's criminal history, a court may count only sentences that were \"previously imposed ... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"   He contends that because the theft and criminal threatening convictions resulted from conduct that was part of the federal drug distribution conspiracy, these convictions cannot be used to increase his criminal history category.  Since Arismendy did not raise this claim in the district court, his sentence can be reversed on this basis only upon a showing of \"plain error.\"   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  He has failed to make such a showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three criteria restrict a reviewing court's authority to reverse a sentence under the plain error rule.  First, a reviewable error must have occurred during the sentencing process.  Second, the error must be \"clear\" or \"obvious.\"   Third, the error must affect \"substantial rights,\" which in most cases means that the defendant must make a specific showing that the error probably affected his sentence.  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 87-88 (1st Cir.1993) (citing United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).  Even if all three criteria have been satisfied, the reviewing court retains the discretion not to correct an error, however plain, unless the error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Olano, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the plain error standard, we reject Arismendy's double counting argument without reaching its merits.  Where the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be \"clear\" or \"obvious\" unless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.  See United States v. Gaudet, 966 F.2d 959, 962 (5th Cir.), reh'g denied, 973 F.2d 927 (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1294, 122 L.Ed.2d 685 (1993).  Here, Arismendy's double counting argument depends upon his claim that the theft and criminal threatening convictions resulted from the unsuccessful effort to collect Rivard's cocaine debt.  However, the record on this subject is equivocal at best.  The Presentence Report describes the theft and criminal threatening convictions without stating whether they resulted from Arismendy's attempt to collect Rivard's debt.  Moreover, the Report states that Arismendy was arrested on the theft and criminal threatening charges on August 7, 1991, whereas the unrebutted evidence produced at trial established that Arismendy was arrested for his role in the debt collection effort on June 2, 1991.  Since Arismendy never challenged this portion of the Presentence Report, the only support for his argument in the record is that his attempt to collect Rivard's cocaine debt involved conduct that could have resulted in theft and criminal threatening convictions.  While we might infer from this evidence that the theft and criminal threatening charges and the debt collection effort are related, the record also amply supports the opposite conclusion.  We therefore cannot conclude that the district court committed obvious error in using the theft and criminal threatening convictions to enhance his criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed above, Arismendy's sentence is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Second, he claims for the first time on appeal that the court engaged in \"double counting\" when it increased his criminal history category by using prior convictions that allegedly resulted from the conspiracy on which his federal sentence was based.  Finding no reversible error, we affirm Arismendy's sentence in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. The Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall of 1990, Arismendy met Ramon Verona, a small-time drug dealer, and offered to sell him cocaine.  Verona initially declined.  However, he later contacted Arismendy on two occasions and purchased 125 grams of cocaine on credit.  Two or three months later, Arismendy persuaded Verona and an unidentified woman to make several trips from New York to Massachusetts to transport cocaine.  Once in Massachusetts, Verona and the courier delivered the cocaine to a confederate of Arismendy's whom Verona knew only as \"Giovanni.\"   For each trip, Verona was paid $500 and supplied with 125 grams of cocaine on credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verona used the cocaine he obtained from Arismendy to supply three of his customers in Maine, Peter Lauzier, Vicki Hall and Pauline Rivard.  Because Verona ran the cocaine operation on credit, however, debt collection quickly became a significant problem.  By May 1991, Rivard owed Verona approximately $16,000 for \"fronted\" cocaine, $4,000 of which was owed to Arismendy.  Arismendy's solution to this problem was to recruit Verona's paramour, Argentina Dalmassi, and three men, to travel with him to Maine to collect the debt.  On June 2, 1991, the group arrived at Rivard's home and confronted her boyfriend, Robert Pelletier.  When Pelletier informed them that Rivard was not at home, Arismendy and the three men ransacked the house, taking some cash and some jewelry.  As they were leaving, Arismendy proposed that he take possession of Pelletier's boat and provide Pelletier with cocaine to sell until he paid back what Rivard owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Arismendy encountered Rivard at a nearby flower shop and demanded payment.  Although she believed that she only owed money to Verona, Rivard promised to pay Arismendy the next day.  Moments later, Dalmassi appeared, slapped Rivard in the face and demanded immediate payment.  Arismendy, however, ordered Dalmassi to leave.  The group was arrested on charges related to this collection attempt but they were all released on bail later that day.  Fearing for her safety when she learned of their release, Rivard went to the authorities and offered to cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1991, Arismendy, unbeknownst to Verona, began distributing cocaine directly to Lauzier and Hall.  For the next several months, Arismendy supplied them with two to ten ounces of cocaine every other week.  In early October, a customer contacted Lauzier and Hall and asked to purchase cocaine.  In response, Lauzier and Hall went to a trailer owned by their friend, Elwin Baker, weighed the cocaine in Arismendy's presence, and drove to a local bar to make the sale.  They were immediately arrested, however, because their customer sold the cocaine to an undercover officer of the Maine Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement (MBIDE).  Arismendy, who was waiting to be paid for the cocaine, became concerned after Lauzier and Hall failed to return, and he sent Baker out to search for them.  When Arismendy learned that they had been arrested, he had Baker drive him back to his home in New York.  Arismendy later placed Baker in charge of Lauzier and Hall's business and sold him as much as eight ounces of cocaine at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy was arrested by the MBIDE in January 1992 and was subsequently convicted of the present federal charges in the United States District Court for the District of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a sentencing hearing on February 26, 1993.  Verona was called as a witness at the hearing and cross examined by the defense in an effort to attack his trial testimony.  During this examination, Verona testified that he had made at least four trips from New York to Massachusetts, transporting seven kilograms of cocaine on the first trip, and added, \"I don't remember well, but I think the other [trips] were about 10 kilograms each.\"   This testimony differed slightly from his trial testimony where he had claimed that he had made \"five or six trips\" and had delivered seven kilograms of cocaine on the first two trips and ten kilograms on each remaining trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining Arismendy's total offense level, the district court first grouped the two counts on which Arismendy had been convicted, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3D1.2(d), and set his base offense level at 34 because it found that Arismendy's conduct involved approximately 36 kilograms of cocaine.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5) (Drug Quantity Table) (establishing base offense level 34 for conduct involving \"[a]t least 15 KG but less than 50 KG of Cocaine\").  The court then found that Arismendy had been an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants and added four levels to his base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  Finally, because Arismendy had received two firearms as partial payment for cocaine, the court made an additional two-level increase to his offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1).  These calculations resulted in a total offense level of 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then placed Arismendy in criminal history category II by assigning one criminal history point to prior State of Maine convictions for theft and criminal threatening and a second point to a prior State of New York conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c).  Accordingly, the court determined Arismendy's guideline sentencing range to be 324-405 months.  The court then sentenced Arismendy to 365 months in prison, five years of supervised release and a $5,000 fine.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Offense Level</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy challenges two steps in the district court's offense level computation.  We consider his claims \"mindful that we must both 'accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous' and 'give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.' \"  United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 507 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Cocaine Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's first argument is that the sentencing court erroneously relied on Verona's testimony in determining the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy because Verona offered uncorroborated and self-contradictory testimony in an effort to receive favorable treatment from the government.  We reject this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's counsel forthrightly conceded at oral argument that if Verona's testimony were believed, his claim would collapse.  Given this concession, we easily conclude that the district court did not err in its drug quantity determination.  The record shows unequivocally that after considering the evidence and rejecting the same arguments now raised on appeal, the court found Verona's testimony to be credible.  In the absence of clear error, such assessments are exclusively within the province of the sentencing court.  We find no such error here.  Cf. id. at 508 (\"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Leadership Role</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy next claims that the district court committed clear error when it increased his offense level by four levels because of his alleged leadership role in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  He contends that the enhancement was improper because the evidence established only that he acted alone in selling cocaine to multiple \"independent customers.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conditions must be met before a leadership role enhancement is in order under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).  See United States v. Preakos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543832\"><a href=\"/opinion/543832/united-states-v-darrell-walter-preakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam).  First, the sentencing court must find that the defendant acted as \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity.\"   Second, the activity must have \"involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   See United States v. McDowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551473\"><a href=\"/opinion/551473/united-states-v-billy-ray-mcdowell-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1011 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a defendant had a leadership role in criminal activity, the commentary to section 3B1.1 instructs courts to consider such factors as decision making authority, recruitment of accomplices, degree of participation in planning the offense, degree of control over others, and a claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, comment.  (n. 4);  see also Preakos, 907 F.2d at 9.   Because such \"role in the offense\" assessments are fact-specific, the district court's views must be accorded \"considerable respect.\"   See United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 333 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant record amply supports the district court's conclusion that Arismendy was an organizer or leader of the drug distribution conspiracy.  The court could reasonably have inferred from the trial evidence that Arismendy:  (1) initiated cocaine discussions with Verona;  (2) convinced Lauzier and Hall to work with him;  (3) attempted to persuade Pelletier to sell cocaine for him;  (4) actively supervised the collection of debts;  (5) instructed Baker to take over the Maine distribution business after Lauzier and Hall were arrested;  and (6) exercised a high degree of decision making authority both in organizing the multi-kilogram cocaine shipments from New York to Massachusetts and in directing and coordinating Verona and the female courier.  Given these permissible inferences, the court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Arismendy was an organizer or leader of the criminal activity.  Cf., e.g., Preakos, 907 F.2d at 9-10 (upholding enhancement where defendant, among other things, \"exercised control over his distributors, at least in the sense that he directed them with regard to their role in the various cocaine shipments and apparently coordinated aspects of the distribution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also could have plausibly concluded from the record that five or more participants were involved in Arismendy's criminal activity.  Under section 3B1.1(a), a \"participant\" is any person, including the defendant, who is \"criminally responsible for the commission of the offense....\"  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, comment.  (n. 1);  see also Preakos, 907 F.2d at 10 (defendant included as a participant under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a)).  Even without counting the persons Arismendy claims were merely customers, at least five others, including Arismendy, Verona, the female courier, Giovanni, and one or more of the four debt collectors, could reasonably have been considered participants in Arismendy's criminal activity.  Thus, we find no clear error in the sentencing court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Criminal History Category</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arismendy's final contention is that the district court engaged in \"double counting\" when it used the theft and criminal threatening convictions--which, appellant claims, resulted from his June 1991, collection attempt against Rivard--to increase his criminal history category.  Arismendy bases this claim on section 4A1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines, which provides that in computing a defendant's criminal history, a court may count only sentences that were \"previously imposed ... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"   He contends that because the theft and criminal threatening convictions resulted from conduct that was part of the federal drug distribution conspiracy, these convictions cannot be used to increase his criminal history category.  Since Arismendy did not raise this claim in the district court, his sentence can be reversed on this basis only upon a showing of \"plain error.\"   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  He has failed to make such a showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three criteria restrict a reviewing court's authority to reverse a sentence under the plain error rule.  First, a reviewable error must have occurred during the sentencing process.  Second, the error must be \"clear\" or \"obvious.\"   Third, the error must affect \"substantial rights,\" which in most cases means that the defendant must make a specific showing that the error probably affected his sentence.

Where the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be \"clear\" or \"obvious\" unless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.  See United States v. Gaudet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584541\"><a href=\"/opinion/584541/united-states-v-stanley-j-gaudet/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span>, 962 (5th Cir.), reh'g denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></span> (5th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span> (1993).  Here, Arismendy's double counting argument depends upon his claim that the theft and criminal threatening convictions resulted from the unsuccessful effort to collect Rivard's cocaine debt.  However, the record on this subject is equivocal at best.  The Presentence Report describes the theft and criminal threatening convictions without stating whether they resulted from Arismendy's attempt to collect Rivard's debt.  Moreover, the Report states that Arismendy was arrested on the theft and criminal threatening charges on August 7, 1991, whereas the unrebutted evidence produced at trial established that Arismendy was arrested for his role in the debt collection effort on June 2, 1991.  Since Arismendy never challenged this portion of the Presentence Report, the only support for his argument in the record is that his attempt to collect Rivard's cocaine debt involved conduct that could have resulted in theft and criminal threatening convictions.  While we might infer from this evidence that the theft and criminal threatening charges and the debt collection effort are related, the record also amply supports the opposite conclusion.  We therefore cannot conclude that the district court committed obvious error in using the theft and criminal threatening convictions to enhance his criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed above, Arismendy's sentence is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
