Appellant has appealed  from an order\n                    \n\nof  the district  court  holding him  in  civil contempt  for\n\nrefusing to testify as a witness before a grand jury.  See 28\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.    1826(a).   The  district court  granted appellant's\n\nrequest for bail pending appeal, finding that the  appeal was\n\nnot frivolous or taken for delay.  Id.   1826(b).\n                                      \n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Appellant's relationship with the  government began\n\nin July 1987 when he was served a subpoena to testify  before\n\na grand jury investigating money laundering, particularly  in\n\nrelation  to Heller's  Cafe and  Michael London.   Appellant,\n\nthrough  his   attorney,  informed  the  government  that  he\n\nintended to assert  his Fifth Amendment  right against  self-\n\nincrimination.   The government  then  obtained an  order  of\n\nimmunity under 18 U.S.C.    6002 and 6003.\n\n          Prior to appearing before the grand jury, appellant\n\nand  his attorney  met informally  with Mitchell  Dembin, the\n\nassistant   United   States  Attorney   in   charge  of   the\n\ninvestigation, and  other law enforcement officers.   At this\n\npre-grand jury  meeting, appellant's attorney  advised Dembin\n\nthat appellant would refuse to answer any questions -- either\n\ninformally or before the grand  jury -- regarding the payment\n\nof \"rent.\"1   Appellant did  provide, on  an informal  basis,\n\n                    \n\n1.  According to the district court, \"rent\" is a term used to\nrefer  to  extortionate  payments that  bookmakers  have,  at\ntimes,  been  required to  make  to  certain organized  crime\nfigures.\n\nother information about  general gambling practices  directly\n\nto Dembin.\n\n          According  to Dembin's  affidavit submitted  to the\n\ndistrict  court, he had stated to appellant that he would not\n\nask appellant any questions  concerning rent before the grand\n\njury  or inquire  into  the identities  of those  running the\n\nbookmaking  organization for  which  appellant  then  worked.\n\nDembin asserts,  in  the affidavit,  that  he had  made  this\n\ndecision  on   the   ground  that   the   \"circumstances   of\n\n[appellant's]  `rent'  and his  current  employment situation\n\nappeared  to  be  beyond  the  scope  of  the  Heller's  Cafe\n\ninvestigation.\"  Consequently, Dembin  did not ask about rent\n\nwhen  appellant  appeared  before  the grand  jury  in  early\n\nJanuary 1988.   It  is undisputed,  however, that  Dembin was\n\naware  that  the  Organized   Crime  Strike  Force  was  then\n\ninvestigating  allegations  that   certain  organized   crime\n\nfigures were requiring bookmakers to pay rent to them.\n\n          In  December  1990,  appellant  received  a  second\n\nsubpoena  to appear before a grand jury.   At this time, Mark\n\nPearlstein was the assistant  United States Attorney involved\n\nwith  the grand  jury proceedings.   He  was investigating  a\n\ncheck-cashing  business  suspected  of  money  laundering  on\n\nbehalf of bookmakers.  A  second immunity order was obtained.\n\nAppellant again met with prosecutors on an informal basis and\n\nprovided them with  information concerning betting  practices\n\n                             -4-\n\nand procedures.   In his  affidavit, Pearlstein  acknowledges\n\nthat he  was  aware that  Dembin  had refrained  from  asking\n\nappellant  about rent.  He followed the same path because the\n\nsubject of  rent payments \"was of little  direct relevance to\n\nthe  investigation\"  he  was conducting.    Accordingly, when\n\nappellant appeared before the grand jury in January  1991, he\n\nwas not asked about rent.\n\n          In February 1992, appellant made a third appearance\n\nbefore a grand jury.  According to appellant, he was informed\n\nthat  this  was  the same  grand  jury  before  which he  had\n\nappeared in 1991.  This time, the two United States Attorneys\n\nwho questioned  appellant were connected to  the Strike Force\n\nand were investigating  the payment  of rent.   As a  result,\n\nappellant was  questioned on this subject;  he testified that\n\nhe did not pay rent.  Appellant did not mention,  during this\n\ngrand  jury  appearance,  any  agreement or  promise  by  the\n\ngovernment that he would not be asked such questions.\n\n          Also, in January  1993, appellant testified  at the\n\ntrial of Michael London.  Before giving his testimony, he met\n\nwith the  prosecutors for  five to eight  hours and  answered\n\nmany inquiries  concerning betting practices  and procedures;\n\nnonetheless,  he was  not questioned about  rent.   At trial,\n\nhowever, appellant  was asked  by the prosecution  whether he\n\npaid  rent  to certain  individuals.   He  stated, as  he had\n\nbefore the  grand jury, that he  did not pay rent.   After it\n\n                             -5-\n\nwas learned that appellant had given false answers concerning\n\nrent payments (both  at the  1992 grand jury  and the  London\n                                                             \n\ntrial), appellant  was recalled  to the  stand in  the London\n                                                             \n\ntrial.    He  then  admitted  that  he  had  given  incorrect\n\ninformation, but declined  to identify anyone to  whom he had\n\npaid rent.2    He again did not mention  any agreement to the\n\neffect that he did not have to answer such questions.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          This brings us to the present.  Appellant, on April\n\n8,  1993, appeared for the fourth time before the grand jury.\n\nAgain,  this  grand  jury  proceeding was  represented  as  a\n\ncontinuation  of   the  prior  grand   jury  investigations.3\n\nAppellant  now refused  to  answer  any questions  concerning\n\nrent.    Upon the  government's  petition  for contempt,  the\n\ndistrict court  held a hearing at  which appellant testified.\n\nHe  asserted  that his  refusal to  testify  was based  on an\n\nagreement between  himself and  the government that  he would\n\nnever  have to  answer questions  relating to the  payment of\n\nrent as long as  he continued to answer  questions concerning\n\ngambling practices in general.\n\n                    \n\n2.  According to  the government,  appellant was not  held in\ncontempt  because the  question  was  withdrawn  by  London's\ncounsel.\n\n3.  To  avoid any  problems with  the  validity of  the prior\nimmunity orders, a new order was entered on April 28, 1993.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          The  district  court judge  made  several findings.\n\nFirst, he  determined that appellant had  met informally with\n\nDembin prior to testifying before the grand jury, even though\n\nthe immunity order did not require such a meeting, because it\n\nwas in his best interests to  do so.  The judge  acknowledged\n\nDembin's statement that he would not question appellant about\n\nrent.  He concluded that \"Dembin did not promise [appellant],\n\nhowever,  that  those  questions  would  never  be  asked  of\n\n[appellant] before any future Grand Jury.\"\n\n          Second,  the  judge accepted  the  explanation that\n\nDembin  was merely  being \"prudent,\"  seeking to  get answers\n\nrelevant  to  his  investigation without  the  time-consuming\n\ndelays of litigation.  The judge further held that\n\n          in  January,  1988, [appellant]  may well\n          have had  a hope  that he would  never be\n          asked about rent.  I  also find, however,\n          that he did not  then believe, and in any\n          event could not have  reasonably believed\n          that  he had  an  agreement or  assurance\n          that he  would never be  asked about that\n          subject.\n\n          As for Pearlstein, the judge determined that he had\n\nacted  with the same motives as  Dembin because, like Dembin,\n\nhe was interested in money laundering, not rent.  As such, he\n\nalso  had  sought  the  most  efficient  way  to  secure  the\n\ninformation he needed.  Thus, the judge found, Pearlstein had\n\nnot,  through his  conduct,  \"recognize[d]  or create[d]  any\n\nagreement that the Government  would not ever ask [appellant]\n\n. . . questions [about rent].\"\n\n                             -7-\n\n          Based on the  foregoing, the  judge concluded  that\n\nthere was  no agreement between the  government and appellant\n\nthat he would never be asked about rent.  He pointed out that\n\nappellant  had  never  raised   the  existence  of  any  such\n\nagreement  when he  was asked  about rent  at the  1992 grand\n\njury,  nor did he attempt  to consult with  his attorney even\n\nthough  his  attorney  was  present outside  the  jury  room.\n\nAppellant's failure  to mention  the agreement at  the London\n                                                             \n\ntrial also belied his claim that an agreement concerning rent\n\nthen existed.   Finally, the judge  determined that appellant\n\n\"did  not rely to his detriment or give any consideration for\n\nthe purported agreement he now seeks to rely on.\"\n\n          As   for  appellant's   claim  that   his  informal\n\ncooperation  with  the  government  --  supplying information\n\noutside   of   the  grand   jury   --   constituted  adequate\n\nconsideration, the judge declared:\n\n               It is often the case that a  witness\n          compelled to testify  will meet with  his\n          counsel   and   the   Government   before\n          testifying because it  has the  potential\n          to make his Grand Jury testimony or trial\n          direct  and  cross-examination  testimony\n          proceed more smoothly.   I find that that\n          is  essentially  what  occurred  in  this\n          case.\n\nBecause appellant failed to establish a sufficient reason for\n\nhis  refusal to  answer  the questions  concerning rent,  the\n\njudge granted the government's petition for contempt.\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n                             -8-\n\n          Whether   the  conduct  in  this  case  constituted\n\ncontempt  turns  on a  simple issue.    If the  government in\n\nexchange for  cooperation bound  itself not to  ask appellant\n\nany  further questions about rent, then under the case law he\n\nwas  not obliged to answer.  Such commitments, where they are\n\nmade, are  treated as akin  to contracts and  construed under\n\ncontract  law principles.   United  States v.  Pelletier, 898\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 297, 301  (2d Cir.  1990); United States  v. Hogan,  862\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir. 1988).  Indeed, \"due process requires\n\nthat the government adhere to the terms of any . . . immunity\n\nagreement it makes.\"  Pelletier, 898  F.2d at 302.  Where the\n                               \n\nterms of  an agreement  are not  clear because,  for example,\n\nthere  is  no written  contract,  the court's  \"task  [is] to\n\nconstrue the words used to try, if possible, to carry out the\n\nintention  of the  parties  in light  of  all the  facts  and\n\nsurrounding circumstances . . . .\"   In re Wellins, 627  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n969, 971 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n          In  this case,  the district  court found  as facts\n\nthat the government in the initial  grand jury sessions chose\n\nnot  to  question appellant  about  rent  but never  promised\n\nappellant permanent  immunity from such questions.   Further,\n\nthe  district  court found  that  appellant  himself did  not\n\nbelieve  that he had been given any such promise of permanent\n\nimmunity.    Findings  of  fact  by  the  district court,  in\n\ncontempt proceedings  as  elsewhere,  are  reviewed  under  a\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeferential standard and will not be set aside unless clearly\n\nerroneous.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n          The district  court's findings are  amply supported\n\nby the  evidence.  There was no  written agreement; appellant\n\nhimself failed  to recollect,  even by  his own  account, the\n\nprecise  wording that  he now  claims to  have amounted  to a\n\nbinding  commitment; and  appellant's failure  to invoke  any\n\nsuch  supposed agreement  when questioned  at the  1992 grand\n\njury session  thoroughly undercuts his present  claim.  These\n\nfacts support the finding that there was no commitment, hence\n\nno justification for appellant's failure to testify.\n\n          Given the  inherently factual nature of issues like\n\nthis  one,  there  is no  reason  to  address  at length  the\n\nauthorities  cited  by  appellant,  which  are  in  any  case\n\ndistinguishable.    In  In   re  Wellins,  for  example,  the\n                                        \n\ngovernment  was  found to  have  obtained  cooperation by  an\n\nagreement that  Wellins' cooperation would  not be  revealed;\n\nand  the court  enforced that  agreement.   627 F.2d  at 971.\n\nSimilarly in In Re  Doe, 410 F. Supp. 1163 (E.D. Mich. 1976),\n                       \n\na witness turned over drugs following a promise that he would\n\nnot be further questioned  about them and the court  held the\n\ngovernment to its commitment.\n\n          If   appellant  in  this   case  had  a  comparable\n\nagreement, it  too would be  enforced, but appellant  has not\n\nproved such an  agreement.  Absent an agreement, the contempt\n\n                             -10-\n\nis   patent  and   the  order   under  review   is  affirmed.\n                                                            \n\nAppellant's motion for oral argument is denied.\n\n                             -11-\n",

Appellant has appealed  from an order\n                    \n\nof  the district  court  holding him  in  civil contempt  for\n\nrefusing to testify as a witness before a grand jury.  See 28\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.    1826(a).   The  district court  granted appellant's\n\nrequest for bail pending appeal, finding that the  appeal was\n\nnot frivolous or taken for delay.  Id.   1826(b).\n                                      \n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Appellant's relationship with the  government began\n\nin July 1987 when he was served a subpoena to testify  before\n\na grand jury investigating money laundering, particularly  in\n\nrelation  to Heller's  Cafe and  Michael London.   Appellant,\n\nthrough  his   attorney,  informed  the  government  that  he\n\nintended to assert  his Fifth Amendment  right against  self-\n\nincrimination.   The government  then  obtained an  order  of\n\nimmunity under 18 U.S.C.    6002 and 6003.\n\n          Prior to appearing before the grand jury, appellant\n\nand  his attorney  met informally  with Mitchell  Dembin, the\n\nassistant   United   States  Attorney   in   charge  of   the\n\ninvestigation, and  other law enforcement officers.   At this\n\npre-grand jury  meeting, appellant's attorney  advised Dembin\n\nthat appellant would refuse to answer any questions -- either\n\ninformally or before the grand  jury -- regarding the payment\n\nof \"rent.\"1   Appellant did  provide, on  an informal  basis,\n\n                    \n\n1.  According to the district court, \"rent\" is a term used to\nrefer  to  extortionate  payments that  bookmakers  have,  at\ntimes,  been  required to  make  to  certain organized  crime\nfigures.\n\nother information about  general gambling practices  directly\n\nto Dembin.\n\n          According  to Dembin's  affidavit submitted  to the\n\ndistrict  court, he had stated to appellant that he would not\n\nask appellant any questions  concerning rent before the grand\n\njury  or inquire  into  the identities  of those  running the\n\nbookmaking  organization for  which  appellant  then  worked.\n\nDembin asserts,  in  the affidavit,  that  he had  made  this\n\ndecision  on   the   ground  that   the   \"circumstances   of\n\n[appellant's]  `rent'  and his  current  employment situation\n\nappeared  to  be  beyond  the  scope  of  the  Heller's  Cafe\n\ninvestigation.\"  Consequently, Dembin  did not ask about rent\n\nwhen  appellant  appeared  before  the grand  jury  in  early\n\nJanuary 1988.   It  is undisputed,  however, that  Dembin was\n\naware  that  the  Organized   Crime  Strike  Force  was  then\n\ninvestigating  allegations  that   certain  organized   crime\n\nfigures were requiring bookmakers to pay rent to them.\n\n          In  December  1990,  appellant  received  a  second\n\nsubpoena  to appear before a grand jury.   At this time, Mark\n\nPearlstein was the assistant  United States Attorney involved\n\nwith  the grand  jury proceedings.   He  was investigating  a\n\ncheck-cashing  business  suspected  of  money  laundering  on\n\nbehalf of bookmakers.  A  second immunity order was obtained.\n\nAppellant again met with prosecutors on an informal basis and\n\nprovided them with  information concerning betting  practices\n\n                             -4-\n\nand procedures.   In his  affidavit, Pearlstein  acknowledges\n\nthat he  was  aware that  Dembin  had refrained  from  asking\n\nappellant  about rent.  He followed the same path because the\n\nsubject of  rent payments \"was of little  direct relevance to\n\nthe  investigation\"  he  was conducting.    Accordingly, when\n\nappellant appeared before the grand jury in January  1991, he\n\nwas not asked about rent.\n\n          In February 1992, appellant made a third appearance\n\nbefore a grand jury.  According to appellant, he was informed\n\nthat  this  was  the same  grand  jury  before  which he  had\n\nappeared in 1991.  This time, the two United States Attorneys\n\nwho questioned  appellant were connected to  the Strike Force\n\nand were investigating  the payment  of rent.   As a  result,\n\nappellant was  questioned on this subject;  he testified that\n\nhe did not pay rent.  Appellant did not mention,  during this\n\ngrand  jury  appearance,  any  agreement or  promise  by  the\n\ngovernment that he would not be asked such questions.\n\n          Also, in January  1993, appellant testified  at the\n\ntrial of Michael London.  Before giving his testimony, he met\n\nwith the  prosecutors for  five to eight  hours and  answered\n\nmany inquiries  concerning betting practices  and procedures;\n\nnonetheless,  he was  not questioned about  rent.   At trial,\n\nhowever, appellant  was asked  by the prosecution  whether he\n\npaid  rent  to certain  individuals.   He  stated, as  he had\n\nbefore the  grand jury, that he  did not pay rent.   After it\n\n                             -5-\n\nwas learned that appellant had given false answers concerning\n\nrent payments (both  at the  1992 grand jury  and the  London\n                                                             \n\ntrial), appellant  was recalled  to the  stand in  the London\n                                                             \n\ntrial.    He  then  admitted  that  he  had  given  incorrect\n\ninformation, but declined  to identify anyone to  whom he had\n\npaid rent.2    He again did not mention  any agreement to the\n\neffect that he did not have to answer such questions.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          This brings us to the present.  Appellant, on April\n\n8,  1993, appeared for the fourth time before the grand jury.\n\nAgain,  this  grand  jury  proceeding was  represented  as  a\n\ncontinuation  of   the  prior  grand   jury  investigations.3\n\nAppellant  now refused  to  answer  any questions  concerning\n\nrent.    Upon the  government's  petition  for contempt,  the\n\ndistrict court  held a hearing at  which appellant testified.\n\nHe  asserted  that his  refusal to  testify  was based  on an\n\nagreement between  himself and  the government that  he would\n\nnever  have to  answer questions  relating to the  payment of\n\nrent as long as  he continued to answer  questions concerning\n\ngambling practices in general.\n\n                    \n\n2.  According to  the government,  appellant was not  held in\ncontempt  because the  question  was  withdrawn  by  London's\ncounsel.\n\n3.  To  avoid any  problems with  the  validity of  the prior\nimmunity orders, a new order was entered on April 28, 1993.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          The  district  court judge  made  several findings.\n\nFirst, he  determined that appellant had  met informally with\n\nDembin prior to testifying before the grand jury, even though\n\nthe immunity order did not require such a meeting, because it\n\nwas in his best interests to  do so.  The judge  acknowledged\n\nDembin's statement that he would not question appellant about\n\nrent.  He concluded that \"Dembin did not promise [appellant],\n\nhowever,  that  those  questions  would  never  be  asked  of\n\n[appellant] before any future Grand Jury.\"\n\n          Second,  the  judge accepted  the  explanation that\n\nDembin  was merely  being \"prudent,\"  seeking to  get answers\n\nrelevant  to  his  investigation without  the  time-consuming\n\ndelays of litigation.  The judge further held that\n\n          in  January,  1988, [appellant]  may well\n          have had  a hope  that he would  never be\n          asked about rent.  I  also find, however,\n          that he did not  then believe, and in any\n          event could not have  reasonably believed\n          that  he had  an  agreement or  assurance\n          that he  would never be  asked about that\n          subject.\n\n          As for Pearlstein, the judge determined that he had\n\nacted  with the same motives as  Dembin because, like Dembin,\n\nhe was interested in money laundering, not rent.  As such, he\n\nalso  had  sought  the  most  efficient  way  to  secure  the\n\ninformation he needed.  Thus, the judge found, Pearlstein had\n\nnot,  through his  conduct,  \"recognize[d]  or create[d]  any\n\nagreement that the Government  would not ever ask [appellant]\n\n. . . questions [about rent].\"\n\n                             -7-\n\n          Based on the  foregoing, the  judge concluded  that\n\nthere was  no agreement between the  government and appellant\n\nthat he would never be asked about rent.  He pointed out that\n\nappellant  had  never  raised   the  existence  of  any  such\n\nagreement  when he  was asked  about rent  at the  1992 grand\n\njury,  nor did he attempt  to consult with  his attorney even\n\nthough  his  attorney  was  present outside  the  jury  room.\n\nAppellant's failure  to mention  the agreement at  the London\n                                                             \n\ntrial also belied his claim that an agreement concerning rent\n\nthen existed.   Finally, the judge  determined that appellant\n\n\"did  not rely to his detriment or give any consideration for\n\nthe purported agreement he now seeks to rely on.\"\n\n          As   for  appellant's   claim  that   his  informal\n\ncooperation  with  the  government  --  supplying information\n\noutside   of   the  grand   jury   --   constituted  adequate\n\nconsideration, the judge declared:\n\n               It is often the case that a  witness\n          compelled to testify  will meet with  his\n          counsel   and   the   Government   before\n          testifying because it  has the  potential\n          to make his Grand Jury testimony or trial\n          direct  and  cross-examination  testimony\n          proceed more smoothly.   I find that that\n          is  essentially  what  occurred  in  this\n          case.\n\nBecause appellant failed to establish a sufficient reason for\n\nhis  refusal to  answer  the questions  concerning rent,  the\n\njudge granted the government's petition for contempt.\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n                             -8-\n\n          Whether   the  conduct  in  this  case  constituted\n\ncontempt  turns  on a  simple issue.    If the  government in\n\nexchange for  cooperation bound  itself not to  ask appellant\n\nany  further questions about rent, then under the case law he\n\nwas  not obliged to answer.  Such commitments, where they are\n\nmade, are  treated as akin  to contracts and  construed under\n\ncontract  law principles.   United  States v.

Further,\n\nthe  district  court found  that  appellant  himself did  not\n\nbelieve  that he had been given any such promise of permanent\n\nimmunity.    Findings  of  fact  by  the  district court,  in\n\ncontempt proceedings  as  elsewhere,  are  reviewed  under  a\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeferential standard and will not be set aside unless clearly\n\nerroneous.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n          The district  court's findings are  amply supported\n\nby the  evidence.  There was no  written agreement; appellant\n\nhimself failed  to recollect,  even by  his own  account, the\n\nprecise  wording that  he now  claims to  have amounted  to a\n\nbinding  commitment; and  appellant's failure  to invoke  any\n\nsuch  supposed agreement  when questioned  at the  1992 grand\n\njury session  thoroughly undercuts his present  claim.  These\n\nfacts support the finding that there was no commitment, hence\n\nno justification for appellant's failure to testify.\n\n          Given the  inherently factual nature of issues like\n\nthis  one,  there  is no  reason  to  address  at length  the\n\nauthorities  cited  by  appellant,  which  are  in  any  case\n\ndistinguishable.    In  In   re  Wellins,  for  example,  the\n                                        \n\ngovernment  was  found to  have  obtained  cooperation by  an\n\nagreement that  Wellins' cooperation would  not be  revealed;\n\nand  the court  enforced that  agreement.   627 F.2d  at 971.\n\nSimilarly in In Re  Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308550/matter-of-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
