The  appeal involves  two  jury\n\ntrials.    In the  first  trial,  a jury  found  in favor  of\n\nplaintiff, Joseph Jones, and awarded him $225,000 in damages.\n\nThe  district   court  granted   a  postjudgment   motion  by\n\ndefendant, Arthur Pineda,1 vacated the  judgment, and ordered\n\nplaintiff  to  remit $140,000  or submit  to  a new  trial on\n\ndamages.   Plaintiff  refused to  accept the  remittitur, and\n\nproceeded to trial.  This time around he was awarded $20,000.\n\nHe  appeals, challenging  the district  court's jurisdiction,\n\nits decision  to vacate  the  original judgment  and order  a\n\npartial remittitur or a new trial on damages, and the court's\n\nadmission of  evidence,  at  both  trials, on  the  issue  of\n\nmitigation of damages.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The following  facts are  viewed in the  light most\n\nfavorable  to  the verdict  winner,  the  plaintiff, and  all\n\nreasonable  inferences  are drawn  in  his  favor.   Lama  v.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n1.  More  precisely, the  plaintiffs-appellants in  this case\nare the conjugal partnership  comprising Joseph Jones and his\nwife  Vernetta, who  worked together  as  Stenograph Systems,\nInc.   The defendants-appellees  are the conjugal partnership\ncomprising Arthur Pineda and his wife Toni.   Throughout this\nopinion, we refer to the parties in the singular, meaning the\nhusband court reporter.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nBorras, 16 F.3d 473,  477 (1st Cir. 1994).2   Plaintiff Jones\n      \n\ncame from New York State to Puerto Rico in March 1987 to work\n\nas  the official  court reporter  for federal  district judge\n\nJose A. Fuste.  The position was offered for a one-year term,\n\nand Jones  left Judge  Fuste's employ  as scheduled  in March\n\n1988.   Shortly  thereafter, defendant  Pineda, the  official\n\ncourt reporter for federal  district judge Raymond L. Acosta,\n\noffered Jones a lucrative opportunity.  Judge  Acosta was the\n\npresiding judge in the San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation,\n\na complex multi-plaintiff case which promised a lengthy trial\n\nduring which the attorneys would require daily transcripts.\n\n          Pineda realized that he and his wife, who was not a\n\ncourt  reporter  but  aided  her  husband  in  producing  the\n\ntranscripts,  would  be unable  to  handle  this task  alone.\n\nAfter some preliminary discussions, Pineda  and Jones reached\n\nan oral agreement  whereby Pineda agreed  to hire Jones  \"for\n\nthe  entire length of  the Dupont  trial,\" during  which they\n                                 \n\nwould  split all  of  the court  reporting  duties and  fees.\n\nJones  agreed to remain in Puerto Rico until the trial ended,\n\nand  further agreed to get  a letter of  reference from Judge\n\nFuste.  Subsequently, Pineda  sought Judge Acosta's approval,\n\nwhich was  reluctantly given,  for hiring Jones.   Apparently\n\n                    \n\n2.  For a more thorough recitation of the facts of this case,\nwe  refer  you  to  the district  court's  thorough  opinion,\nConjugal   Partnership  Comprised   by   Jones  v.   Conjugal\n                                                             \nPartnership  Comprised by  Pineda, 798  F. Supp.  892 (D.P.R.\n                                 \n1992) (\"Conjugal I\").\n                  \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nJones  had  transcribed several  pretrial conferences  in the\n\nDupont  case, and  Judge Acosta  was  not impressed  with his\n\nreporting  skills.    Nonetheless,  given  Pineda's  repeated\n\nassurances, Judge Acosta  acquiesced to Jones'  participation\n\nfor  \"phase  I\"  of the  Dupont  trial.    But, Pineda  never\n\ninformed  Jones  that  Judge  Acosta's  authorization  was  a\n\ncondition precedent to the  oral contract, or that revocation\n\nof  the  judge's  approval  would result  in  the  contract's\n\ntermination.  And, Pineda never informed Judge Acosta that he\n\nhad hired Jones for the duration of the trial.\n\n          The  Dupont  trial  was  scheduled  to  proceed  in\n\ndiscrete  \"phases.\"  Phase I  began in March  1989 and lasted\n\nfor thirty-three days.  Jones and Pineda shared the  workload\n\nand the  fees generated by  phase I.   Phase II  commenced on\n\nJune 27, 1989,  and lasted  until December 1990.   The  trial\n\nended  in December 1991.  Pineda terminated Jones on June 30,\n\n1989, and told Jones  that he made too many mistakes  and was\n\nslowing things  down.   Earlier that  day  Pineda had  voiced\n\nsimilar concerns about Jones to Judge  Acosta who agreed that\n\nJones should no longer work on the case and revoked his prior\n\nauthorization.  Pineda  told Jones that he  (Pineda), and not\n\nJudge Acosta was responsible for Jones' discharge.  There was\n\nevidence  that  on   June  29,  the  day   before  Jones  was\n\nterminated, a  new system was  developed for linking  the in-\n\ncourt stenograph machine to a computer located outside of the\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncourtroom,  enabling  one  reporter  (Pineda) to  handle  the\n\nreporting work.\n\n          For  his  work  on  phase I  of  the  trial,  Jones\n\nreceived, $49,108.00, or approximately $1,500 for each of the\n\nthirty-three  sessions.   This represents  half of  the total\n\nfees paid  for reporting  services during phase  I, $112,083,\n\nless  expenses.   The  entire  trial  generated  a  total  of\n\n$465,787.75 in court reporting fees.\n\n          The jury found that, under the  parties' agreement,\n\nPineda   was  obligated   to  pay   Jones  one-half   of  the\n\ncompensation  received for transcribing the trial, whether or\n\nnot Judge  Acosta continued  to authorize Jones'  presence in\n\nthe courtroom.   Consequently,  it awarded Jones  $225,000 in\n\ndamages.  \n\n          Pineda moved  for judgment as  a matter of  law, or\n\nalternatively, for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50\n\nand 59.  In  a thoughtful opinion, the district  court denied\n\nthe motion for judgment as a matter of law:\n\n          [T]he  jury  found  reasonably  that,  in\n          exchange for plaintiff's promise to stay,\n          the   defendant    promised   to   employ\n          plaintiff  for the duration of the Dupont\n          trial   and   to   divide   equally   the\n          compensation  he  received;  and  further\n          found    reasonably    that   defendant's\n          obligation to pay  was not conditioned on\n          Judge  Acosta's  continuing  approval  of\n          plaintiff's       participation      and,\n          alternatively,  that defendant  knowingly\n          assumed the risk that Judge  Acosta would\n          not approve  of plaintiff's participation\n          after phase I. . . . \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nConjugal I, 798 F. Supp. at 896.  The court  also declined to\n          \n\norder  a  new trial  on  liability  because  \"the verdict  on\n\nliability, while by no means  inevitable, was not against the\n\nclear weight of the evidence.\"  Id. at 899.  The court found,\n                                   \n\nhowever,  that damages were a \"different story.\"  Id. at 899.\n                                                     \n\nThe  court found  that  the jury's  award was  excessive, was\n\nbased on a  flawed analysis, and that a  new trial limited to\n\nthe issue  of damages  was necessary.   Id.  at 900-02.   The\n                                           \n\ncourt added that plaintiff  could avoid a retrial on  damages\n\nby agreeing to  remit $140,000.   Id. at  902-03.   Plaintiff\n                                     \n\ndeclined  the offer and proceeded  to trial.   He was awarded\n\n$20,000 in damages.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal plaintiff argues primarily that:  (1) the\n\ndistrict  court lacked subject  matter jurisdiction;  (2) the\n\ntrial judge  abused his  discretion in vacating  the original\n\njudgment and  ordering a  remittitur or alternatively,  a new\n\ntrial on damages; and  (3) the trial judge erred  in allowing\n\ndefendant to present  evidence, in both the first  and second\n\ntrials,  concerning mitigation  of damages  because defendant\n\nhad not pleaded mitigation as an affirmative defense.\n\nA.  Jurisdiction\n                \n\n          This action  was removed from  Puerto Rico Superior\n\nCourt  pursuant  to 28  U.S.C.    1442(a)(3).    See Conjugal\n                                                             \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nPartnership   Comprised  by  Jones  v.  Conjugal  Partnership\n                                                             \n\nComprised  by Pineda, 734 F. Supp. 41 (D.P.R. 1990) (granting\n                    \n\ndefendant's removal  petition and denying  plaintiff's motion\n\nto remand).  That statute provides:\n\n          (a)   A   civil   action    or   criminal\n          prosecution  commenced  in a  State court\n          against any of  the following persons may\n          be removed by them to the district  court\n          of the United States for the district and\n          division embracing the  place wherein  it\n          is pending:\n          . . . \n               (3) Any officer of the courts of the\n          United States, for any Act under color of\n          office  or  in  the  performance  of  his\n          duties.\n\n28 U.S.C.    1442(a)(3).3  Plaintiff  contends that the  case\n\nwas improvidently  removed from superior court  and should be\n\nremanded.  We disagree.\n\n          The  statute guarantees  an officer of  the federal\n\ncourts the right to remove an action commenced against him in\n\nstate court when he can  allege a \"colorable\" federal defense\n\nto  that action.

Finally, in opposition  to plaintiff's motion to remand,\n   \n\ndefendant elaborated on the statutes and regulations adverted\n\nto in his removal petition.   In particular, defendant argued\n\nthat court  reporting and  court reporters in  federal courts\n\nare regulated by  28 U.S.C.    753 and  the Court  Reporter's\n\nManual  issued by  the  Administrative Office  of the  United\n\nStates Courts (AO).

Id. at   5.\n                 \n\n          We believe  that these allegations  were sufficient\n\nto satisfy the  statutory requirements, and thus the case was\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nproperly removed.

Plaintiff\n\ninsists, however, that this is a state law breach of contract\n\naction that was properly filed  in superior court and  should\n\nhave  remained there.  We  disagree.  By  raising a colorable\n\nfederal defense, a  defendant-official converts an  otherwise\n\nnonremovable  state law action into one that falls within the\n\nfederal court's jurisdiction.

Moreover,  that this is  a breach of\n\ncontract  case arising under Puerto  Rico law is  not alone a\n\nbar to removal.   See  Camacho v.

Here, we must analyze\n                   \n\nthe district  court's decision against the  proper measure of\n\ndamages under Puerto Rico  law.  The Supreme Court  of Puerto\n\nRico has held that,\n\n          \"the  measure  of  damages  sustained  by\n          reason  of  failure  on  the part  of  an\n          employer  to comply  with a  contract for\n          services    is,    prima    facie,    the\n          compensation stipulated  in the contract,\n          subject  to reduction  upon proof  by the\n          defendant as  to the amount  the employee\n          did  gain or could have gained during the\n          time the contract remained in force.\"\n\nVillar  &amp; Co.  v.

This standard  was  correctly  identified by  the\n\ndistrict court.  Conjugal I, 798 F. Supp. at 901.\n                           \n\n          Here  the  district  court  engaged  in  a detailed\n\nexamination  of  the  evidence  pertaining  to  damages,  and\n\nconcluded that  the jury's excessive generosity was traceable\n\nto two errors.  First, the court determined that the jury, in\n\ncomputing  plaintiff's damages,  failed  to  deduct the  fees\n\ngenerated  during phase I  of the Dupont  trial, $112,083 (of\n\nwhich  plaintiff received  his  share), from  the total  fees\n\nearned during the entire  trial, $465,787.75.  Therefore, the\n\njury  used  $465,787.75  as   a  starting  point  instead  of\n\n$353,704.25 (i.e., $465,787.75 - $112,083).\n                 \n\n          According to  the district court, the  jury's error\n\nwas  almost  certainly  attributable  to   counsels'  \"casual\n\ntreatment of  the evidence pertaining to  damages.\"  Conjugal\n                                                             \n\nI,  798 F.  Supp. at  900.   The figures  show that  the jury\n \n\nlikely committed  this  oversight.   If  we take  the  higher\n\nfigure,   deduct  $15,000   for  expenses5  and   divide  the\n\ndifference   ($450,787.75)  by   two,  the   quotient  (i.e.,\n                                                            \n\nplaintiff's \"prima  facie\" loss)  comes out  to approximately\n\n$225,000 -- the amount actually awarded by the jury.\n\n          The second defect in the damage award identified by\n\nthe district court was the  jury's apparent failure to reduce\n\n                    \n\n5.  This  is the minimum amount of expenses, supported by the\nrecord, incurred by defendant after plaintiff's discharge.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nplaintiff's damages by the  amount plaintiff earned after his\n\ndischarge on June 30, 1989, and before the termination of the\n\nDupont  trial  in December  1991.    It was  undisputed  that\n\nplaintiff earned approximately $50,000 in 1990 and $40,000 in\n\n1991  from court  reporting  sources.   There  was no  direct\n\ntestimony as  to plaintiff's  court reporting income  for the\n\nbalance of 1989.   Because  Puerto Rico law  requires that  a\n\ndamage award be reduced by the amount of the plaintiff's gain\n\nduring the remaining life of the contract, the jury's failure\n\nto do so here resulted in an excessive damage award.\n\n          After scanning the trial  record, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court  that these  deficiencies infected the  jury's\n\ndamage calculation and resulted in an excessive damage award.\n\nTherefore, a new trial or a partial remittitur was warranted.\n\n          With  respect to  the remittitur,  plaintiff argues\n\nthat he was  willing to remit a  lesser amount, and  that the\n\ncourt's remittitur was excessive.   The rule in this  circuit\n\nfor computing a remittitur is the \"least intrusive\" standard.\n\nSee  Catullo, 834  F.2d at  1083; see  also Earl  v. Bouchard\n                                                             \n\nTransp.

Under  this  standard,  the\n\nremittitur  amount should  reduce  the verdict  \"only to  the\n\nmaximum  that would  be  upheld by  the  trial court  as  not\n\nexcessive.\"  Earl, 917 F.2d at 1330.  The district court used\n                 \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nthis standard in calculating its remittitur.  Conjugal I, 798\n                                                        \n\nF.  Supp. at 902-03.   We can  find nothing in  the record to\n\nsubstantiate plaintiff's  claim that the  trial judge  abused\n\nhis discretion by remitting the amount that he did, $140,000.\n\n          As our  discussion above  indicates, see supra,  p.\n                                                        \n\n14,  the  maximum  amount  of plaintiff's  prima  facie  loss\n\nsupported  by the  evidence  was  $169,350 (i.e.,  ($353,705-\n                                                \n\n$15,000)/2).   Under  Puerto Rico  law, this  figure must  be\n\nreduced  by  the  minimum  amount  of  mitigation  proved  by\n\ndefendant  at trial,  approximately $90,000.6   Consequently,\n\nwe  are left  with a  maximum  damage award  of approximately\n\n$80,000.  Plaintiff's attack  on the amount left in  place by\n\nthe district court, $85,000, is therefore without force.\n\nC.  Mitigation of Damages\n                         \n\n          Plaintiff maintains that he  is entitled to a third\n\ntrial  on  damages  because  the  district  court  improperly\n\nadmitted, at both trials, evidence pertaining to the issue of\n\nmitigation   of  damages.     According  to   plaintiff  this\n\nconstituted  reversible error  because  the  defendant  never\n\npleaded mitigation as an affirmative defense.\n\n                    \n\n6.  Because plaintiff  was only  able to estimate  his annual\nearnings for 1990 and 1991, the district court discounted the\nfigures  provided  by  plaintiff.     The  court   reasonably\nconcluded from the evidence that plaintiff  earned a total of\n$85,000  from  court  reporting   between  the  time  he  was\nterminated  until the end of  the Dupont trial.   Conjugal I,\n                                                            \n798 F.

Nor\n\ndoes it appear that  the issue was addressed in  any pretrial\n\norders  prior to  the first trial.   Plaintiff  did, however,\n\ninclude a  proposed jury instruction concerning mitigation of\n\ndamages in  his proposed charge submitted  in anticipation of\n\nthe first trial.7\n\n          At  the first  trial, the  issue of  mitigation was\n\ninitially raised during  defense counsel's  cross-examination\n\nof plaintiff, when he asked plaintiff about income from court\n\nreporting sources subsequent to being discharged.  At no time\n\nduring  this line  of  questioning  did  plaintiff's  counsel\n\n                    \n\n7.  Plaintiff's proposed instruction number 25 states:\n\n               The measure of damages  sustained by\n          reason of  failure  on  the  part  of  an\n          employer  to  comply  with   a  contract,\n          subject  to reduction  upon proof  by the\n          defendant as  to the amount  the employee\n          did gain or could  have gained during the\n          time  the  contract  remained  in  force.\n          Hardouin  v.

The  sole objections  raised by  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel  were that  the questions exceeded  the scope  of the\n\ndirect  examination, and  that  plaintiff's  income  was  not\n\npertinent to the case.  At the end of the trial, the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury,  without objection from plaintiff,\n\non the doctrine of mitigation.\n\n          After  the  district   court  granted   defendant's\n\npostjudgment  motion,  plaintiff  moved  for  reconsideration\n\nbased in part  on defendant's failure to plead  mitigation of\n\ndamages as an affirmative defense.  The district court denied\n\nthe motion on  the ground that,  \"mitigation was referred  to\n\nrepeatedly during  trial and  in the Court's  instructions to\n\nthe   Jury   without  any   objection  being   interposed  by\n\nplaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' conduct during trial amounted in our\n\nopinion to a waiver of the ground they now assert.\"  \n\n          Between  the  first  and second  trials,  defendant\n\nengaged in extensive discovery on the  issue of mitigation of\n\ndamages.    Questions  concerning mitigation  were  posed  by\n\ndefendant  in  written  interrogatories  and  at  plaintiff's\n\ndeposition.  Both parties retained  experts (certified public\n\naccountants) who authored reports on plaintiff's damages, and\n\nlater  testified  at  trial   on  the  issue  of  mitigation.\n\nAdditionally,  both  parties  submitted  trial  memoranda  in\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nwhich, at the court's direction, the  issue of mitigation was\n\nbriefed.   The parties also filed a joint trial memorandum in\n\nwhich plaintiff included, among  his claims and defenses, the\n\nstatement  that \"[p]laintiffs  made every effort  to mitigate\n\nthe damages caused  by the breach of  contract by defendants,\n\nbut were  set  back  by  the unilateral  termination  of  the\n\ncontract by defendants, which  affected plaintiffs' good name\n\nand reputation in the industry.\"\n\n          Furthermore,  in  the  opening statement  plaintiff\n\nproposed that the  judge give  to the  jury, he  specifically\n\nasked the court to address the issue of mitigation:\n\n               Once the amount due to plaintiffs is\n          determined,  then,  you  must  consider[]\n          whether or not plaintiffs had the duty to\n          mitigate  the  damages   suffered  as   a\n          consequence of the breach of  contract by\n          defendants.   Also, you must consider the\n          steps  taken  by  plaintiffs to  mitigate\n          these damages.  Then, you  must determine\n          whether  an  amount  for   mitigation  of\n          damages, if  any, is to be  deducted from\n          plaintiffs' award.\n\nFinally,  in a  proposed jury  charge submitted prior  to the\n\nsecond   trial,   plaintiff   devoted    seven   instructions\n\nexclusively to the  issue of  mitigation of damages.   At  no\n\ntime during the activities leading up to the second trial did\n\nplaintiff  argue that  defendant  had waived  the defense  of\n\nmitigation of damages by omitting it from his answer.\n\n          On the  opening day of the  second trial, defendant\n\nmoved to amend his answer, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b),\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nto include  mitigation of damages as  an affirmative defense.\n\nPlaintiff   objected.     The  court   overruled  plaintiff's\n\nobjection and allowed the amendment:\n\n               [O]n mitigation, the  law of  Puerto\n          Rico and  every other jurisdiction  is so\n          clear that prima facie damage  for breach\n          of contract places  on the injured  party\n          the obligation to mitigate.\n               But  it is  more than  that.   It is\n          that  part  of  plaintiffs'  proof  in  a\n          breach  of  contract  case, as  in  every\n          case,   is   causation,  liability,   and\n          liability  causing  damage to  the extent\n          that an injured  plaintiff can avoid that\n          damage  by  working  himself.    To  that\n          extent his  damage is not  caused by  the\n          defendant,  but  is,  rather, caused,  if\n          this  is  the  evidence,  by  plaintiffs'\n          failure  to  exert  reasonable effort  to\n          make up for this loss of income.\n                            * * *\n               Now, basically it is the defendants'\n          burden to  prove mitigation.   In the way\n          this  case stands  the defendant  will go\n          forward  and  have the  burden  of proof.\n          But  to  eliminate   from  the  case  the\n          mitigation  issue,  and  implicitly,  the\n          importance of  the plaintiff establishing\n          causation  between  liability and  damage\n          requires,  in my  view, the  amendment of\n          the  pleading  that  the   defendant  has\n          proposed.\n\nTranscript of Second Trial,  Vol. I, pp. 34-35.  At the start\n                          \n\nof the  third  and final  day of  trial, after  the issue  of\n\nmitigation had been litigated,  the court revisited its prior\n\nruling:\n\n               [T]he   Court    now   vacates   its\n          allowance . .  .

The court then\n                           \n\nexplained that defendant was not required to plead mitigation\n\nof  damages as an affirmative defense, and that the court had\n\ngranted defendant's motion to amend because  it did not think\n\nthat  the amendment  had any  real  significance.   The court\n\nadded, however, that  it realized that there  was support for\n\nthe  position  that  mitigation was  an  affirmative defense.\n\nTherefore, the court \"un-amended\"  defendant's answer so that\n\nplaintiff could raise the present issue on appeal.\n\n          After   the  jury  returned  its  $20,000  verdict,\n\nplaintiff moved to set aside the judgment  based primarily on\n\nthe  trial court's  admission  of mitigation  evidence.   The\n\ncourt denied the motion:\n\n               At   the   first  trial   plaintiffs\n          offered  evidence  of  damage   to  their\n          reputation for having been \"kicked out of\n          Puerto Rico\", which was relevant  only to\n          mitigation   and   did   not  object   to\n          instructions submitting the issue  to the\n          jury.     The  retrial   on  damages  was\n          preceded  by  abundant  discovery  as  to\n          mitigation, at the Court's  direction the\n          parties  briefed  the  law applicable  to\n          this  issue  and   both  parties   called\n          alleged   experts    to   testify   about\n          plaintiffs'    actual    and    potential\n          earnings.  In  our opinion  any error  in\n          the  Court's  reception  of  evidence  on\n          mitigation    could    not   have    been\n          prejudicial.\n\nConjugal  Partnership   Comprised   by  Jones   v.

Rule 15(b) provides as follows:\n\n          When issues not  raised by the  pleadings\n          are tried  by express or  implied consent\n          of the parties, they shall be treated  in\n          all respects  as if they had  been raised\n          in  the pleadings.  Such amendment of the\n          pleadings  as may  be necessary  to cause\n          them to  conform to  the evidence and  to\n          raise  these  issues  may  be  made  upon\n          motion  of any  party  at  any time  even\n          after judgment; but failure to do so does\n          not  affect the  result of  the trial  of\n          these issues.  If evidence is objected to\n          at  trial on  the ground  that it  is not\n          within the issues  made by the pleadings,\n          the  court may allow  the pleadings to be\n          amended and  shall do so freely  when the\n          presentation of the  merits of the action\n          will   be   subserved  thereby   and  the\n          objecting  party  fails  to  satisfy  the\n          court that the admission of such evidence\n          would prejudice the party  in maintaining\n          the  party's action  or defense  upon the\n          merits.

Moreover,\n\nin  light  of  the  fact  that  plaintiff,  prior  to  trial,\n\nsubmitted  a proposed  jury  instruction on  the doctrine  of\n\nmitigation,  we   can  reasonably  conclude   that  plaintiff\n\nanticipated   that  the   issue  would   be   litigated,  and\n\nconsequently was not prejudiced when it was raised. \n\n                    \n\n10.

The appeal involves two jury trials.  In the first trial, a jury found in favor of plaintiff, Joseph Jones, and awarded him $225,000 in damages.  The district court granted a postjudgment motion by defendant, Arthur Pineda,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> vacated the judgment, and ordered plaintiff to remit $140,000 or submit to a new trial on damages.  Plaintiff refused to accept the remittitur, and proceeded to trial.  This time around he was awarded $20,000.  He appeals, challenging the district court's jurisdiction, its decision to vacate the original judgment and order a partial remittitur or a new trial on damages, and the court's admission of evidence, at both trials, on the issue of mitigation of damages.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, the plaintiff, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in his favor.  Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Plaintiff Jones came from New York State to Puerto Rico in March 1987 to work as the official court reporter for federal district judge Jose A. Fuste.  The position was offered for a one-year term, and Jones left Judge Fuste's employ as scheduled in March 1988.  Shortly thereafter, defendant Pineda, the official court reporter for federal district judge Raymond L. Acosta, offered Jones a lucrative opportunity.  Judge Acosta was the presiding judge in the San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation, a complex multi-plaintiff case which promised a lengthy trial during which the attorneys would require daily transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pineda realized that he and his wife, who was not a court reporter but aided her husband in producing the transcripts, would be unable to handle this task alone.  After some preliminary discussions, Pineda and Jones reached an oral agreement whereby Pineda agreed to hire Jones \"for the entire length of the Dupont trial,\" during which they would split all of the court reporting duties and fees.  Jones agreed to remain in Puerto Rico until the trial ended, and further agreed to get a letter of reference from Judge Fuste.  Subsequently, Pineda sought Judge Acosta's approval, which was reluctantly given, for hiring Jones.  Apparently Jones had transcribed several pretrial conferences in the Dupont case, and Judge Acosta was not impressed with his reporting skills.  Nonetheless, given Pineda's repeated assurances, Judge Acosta acquiesced to Jones' participation for \"phase I\" of the Dupont trial.  But, Pineda never informed Jones that Judge Acosta's authorization was a condition precedent to the oral contract, or that revocation of the judge's approval would result in the contract's termination.  And, Pineda never informed Judge Acosta that he had hired Jones for the duration of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dupont trial was scheduled to proceed in discrete \"phases.\"   Phase I began in March 1989 and lasted for thirty-three days.  Jones and Pineda shared the workload and the fees generated by phase I.  Phase II commenced on June 27, 1989, and lasted until December 1990.  The trial ended in December 1991.  Pineda terminated Jones on June 30, 1989, and told Jones that he made too many mistakes and was slowing things down.  Earlier that day Pineda had voiced similar concerns about Jones to Judge Acosta who agreed that Jones should no longer work on the case and revoked his prior authorization.  Pineda told Jones that he (Pineda), and not Judge Acosta was responsible for Jones' discharge.  There was evidence that on June 29, the day before Jones was terminated, a new system was developed for linking the in-court stenograph machine to a computer located outside of the courtroom, enabling one reporter (Pineda) to handle the reporting work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his work on phase I of the trial, Jones received, $49,108.00, or approximately $1,500 for each of the thirty-three sessions.  This represents half of the total fees paid for reporting services during phase I, $112,083, less expenses.  The entire trial generated a total of $465,787.75 in court reporting fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that, under the parties' agreement, Pineda was obligated to pay Jones one-half of the compensation received for transcribing the trial, whether or not Judge Acosta continued to authorize Jones' presence in the courtroom.  Consequently, it awarded Jones $225,000 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pineda moved for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 and 59.  In a thoughtful opinion, the district court denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[T]he jury found reasonably that, in exchange for plaintiff's promise to stay, the defendant promised to employ plaintiff for the duration of the Dupont trial and to divide equally the compensation he received;  and further found reasonably that defendant's obligation to pay was not conditioned on Judge Acosta's continuing approval of plaintiff's participation and, alternatively, that defendant knowingly assumed the risk that Judge Acosta would not approve of plaintiff's participation after phase I....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 896.   The court also declined to order a new trial on liability because \"the verdict on liability, while by no means inevitable, was not against the clear weight of the evidence.\"  Id. at 899.   The court found, however, that damages were a \"different story.\"  Id. at 899.   The court found that the jury's award was excessive, was based on a flawed analysis, and that a new trial limited to the issue of damages was necessary.  Id. at 900-02.   The court added that plaintiff could avoid a retrial on damages by agreeing to remit $140,000.  Id. at 902-03.   Plaintiff declined the offer and proceeded to trial.  He was awarded $20,000 in damages.  This appeal ensued.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal plaintiff argues primarily that:  (1) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction;  (2) the trial judge abused his discretion in vacating the original judgment and ordering a remittitur or alternatively, a new trial on damages;  and (3) the trial judge erred in allowing defendant to present evidence, in both the first and second trials, concerning mitigation of damages because defendant had not pleaded mitigation as an affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action was removed from Puerto Rico Superior Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(3).  See Conjugal Partnership Comprised by Jones v. Conjugal Partnership Comprised by Pineda, 734 F.Supp. 41 (D.P.R.1990) (granting defendant's removal petition and denying plaintiff's motion to remand).  That statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>(a) A civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against any of the following persons may be removed by them to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:  ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, for any Act under color of office or in the performance of his duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Plaintiff contends that the case was improvidently removed from superior court and should be remanded.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute guarantees an officer of the federal courts the right to remove an action commenced against him in state court when he can allege a \"colorable\" federal defense to that action.  Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 136, 109 S.Ct. 959, 968, 103 L.Ed.2d 99 (1989);  American Policyholders Ins. Co.  v. Nyacol Products, 989 F.2d 1256, 1259 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Although the Mesa court was concerned principally with Sec. 1442(a)(1), the general provision of the federal officer removal statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Court noted that \"subsections (2)-(4) of Sec. 1442(a) are largely the 'residue' of the pre-1948, more limited removal statutes now entirely encompassed by the general removal provision of the first clause of subsection (1).\"   Mesa, 489 U.S. at 134, 109 S.Ct. at 967.   The Court further noted that subsection (3) should be interpreted consistently with subsection (1).  Id. at 135, 109 S.Ct. at 967-68.   Consequently, the present case was properly removed if defendant asserted a federal right or raised a question of federal law in his defense.  Id. at 126-27, 109 S.Ct. at 963-64 (citing  Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. 257, 262, 25 L.Ed. 648 (1880)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his Answer, defendant alleged that plaintiff \"served at the pleasure of the [District] Court,\" was no longer acceptable to the court because of poor performance, and was properly dismissed by Judge Acosta.  Answer to Complaint at pp A-C &amp; E.  Defendant's removal petition averred that the dispute arose \"out of the laws and regulations of the United States ... which govern and set the relationship between the United States Courts and the court reporters [who] perform duties for said courts, including the power to dismiss or terminate the duties of said court reporters.\"   Notice of Removal at p 2.  The removal petition also stated that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[i]n order to determine whether the defendants are or [are] not liable in this civil action ... any court ... must construe the terms [and] provisions of those Acts of Congress dealing with the United States Courts and those regulations issued by the Administrative Office of the United States dealing with court reporters and the supervisory powers of the courts over federal court reporters....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.   Finally, in opposition to plaintiff's motion to remand, defendant elaborated on the statutes and regulations adverted to in his removal petition.  In particular, defendant argued that court reporting and court reporters in federal courts are regulated by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 753 and the Court Reporter's Manual issued by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO).  Opposition to Motion to Remand at p 4.  Defendant further maintained that he was not personally liable to plaintiff, that Judge Acosta was authorized to discharge plaintiff under Sec. 753 and the AO guidelines, and that the judge did so as a result of plaintiff's inadequate performance.  Id. at p 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that these allegations were sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements, and thus the case was properly removed.  Venezia v. Robinson, 16 F.3d 209, 212 (7th Cir.1994) (\"Once the federal defendant has a plausible federal defense, removal is appropriate so that the federal court may determine whether the defense succeeds.  A federal defendant need not show that he is entitled to prevail in order to have access to the federal forum.\").  Plaintiff insists, however, that this is a state law breach of contract action that was properly filed in superior court and should have remained there.  We disagree.  By raising a colorable federal defense, a defendant-official converts an otherwise nonremovable state law action into one that falls within the federal court's jurisdiction.  See Mesa, 489 U.S. at 136-37, 109 S.Ct. at 968-69.   The federal officer removal statute does not require that the case be one that could have originally been filed in federal court.  Williams v. Brooks, 945 F.2d 1322, 1325 (5th Cir.1991) (citing cases);  see Mesa, 489 U.S. at 136, 109 S.Ct. at 968 (\"The removal statute ... serves to overcome the 'well-pleaded complaint' rule which would otherwise preclude removal even if a federal defense is alleged.\").  Moreover, that this is a breach of contract case arising under Puerto Rico law is not alone a bar to removal.  See Camacho v. Autoridad de Telefonos de Puerto Rico, 868 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1989) (under the federal removal statute \"the right to remove is not vitiated even if the case necessitates the construction and interpretation of state or local law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although plaintiff has pointed to the ultimate failure of defendant's federal defense as a ground for remand, it is irrelevant for purposes of removal under Sec. 1442(a) that Pineda did not prevail on his federal defense.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(c);  see also Jamison v. Wiley, 14 F.3d 222, 239 (4th Cir.1994) (\"Nothing in the federal removal statutes authorizes the remand of a case that has been properly removed under Sec. 1442(a)(1) on the ground that the federal employee's ... defense is later rejected.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument plaintiff argued that our recent decision in American Policyholders precludes application of the federal removal statute in this case.  Our reading of that case leads us to the opposite conclusion.  In American Policyholders we held that a suit against a federal officer exclusively in his or her official capacity is a suit against the agency for purposes of removal under Sec. 1442(a)(1).  American Policyholders, 989 F.2d at 1260.   And, because an agency may not remove a case under the statute, id. at 1259, \"a federal officer sued solely in his or her official capacity may not remove a suit to federal court under the aegis of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(1).\"  Id. at 1261.   Because this action was brought against defendant solely in his individual and not his official capacity, it was subject to removal under Sec. 1442(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Remittitur or A New Trial on Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that the district court erred in vacating the original judgment of $225,000 and ordering a remittitur of $140,000 or, alternatively, a new trial on damages.  According to plaintiff, the district court was not entitled to substitute its judgment for that of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), \"[a] new trial may be granted ... on all or part of the issues....\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a);  Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d 465, 474 (1st Cir.1989).  On the issue of damages the court found that the \"[d]amages awarded to plaintiff by the jury were so clearly excessive ... as to require a new trial on damages, unless a remittitur would be appropriate and acceptable to plaintiff....\" Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 900.   We have recognized that a district court's discretion to grant a new trial extends to cases in which the court determines that the damages awarded by the jury are excessive.  See Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281, 283 (1st Cir.1993) (\" 'The motion for a new trial may invoke the discretion of the court in so far as it is bottomed on the claim ... that the damages are excessive.' \"  (quoting Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Duncan, 311 U.S. 243, 251, 61 S.Ct. 189, 194, 85 L.Ed. 147 (1940)));  McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp., 809 F.2d 129, 135 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under the practice of remittitur ... the court may also condition the denial of a motion for a new trial on the filing by plaintiff of a remittitur in a stated amount.\"  Phelan v. Local 305, 973 F.2d 1050, 1064 (2d Cir.1992);  see also Catullo v. Metzner, 834 F.2d 1075, 1082 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Rule 59 empowers the trial court to order remittitur where a damage award is not supported by the weight of the evidence.\").  The court must, however, hold out the option of a new trial.  Phelan, 973 F.2d at 1064 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will reverse a district court's decision to order a remittitur or a partial new trial due to an excessive damage award, only where the court abused its discretion.  Quinones-Pacheco v. American Airlines, Inc., 979 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1992);  Catullo, 834 F.2d at 1082.   Here, we must analyze the district court's decision against the proper measure of damages under Puerto Rico law.  The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>\"the measure of damages sustained by reason of failure on the part of an employer to comply with a contract for services is, prima facie, the compensation stipulated in the contract, subject to reduction upon proof by the defendant as to the amount the employee did gain or could have gained during the time the contract remained in force.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villar &amp; Co. v. Conde, 30 F.2d 588, 590 (1st Cir.1929) (quoting Hardouin v. Krajawsky-Pesant Co., 22 P.R.R. 641 (1923)).  This standard was correctly identified by the district court.  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the district court engaged in a detailed examination of the evidence pertaining to damages, and concluded that the jury's excessive generosity was traceable to two errors.  First, the court determined that the jury, in computing plaintiff's damages, failed to deduct the fees generated during phase I of the Dupont trial, $112,083 (of which plaintiff received his share), from the total fees earned during the entire trial, $465,787.75.  Therefore, the jury used $465,787.75 as a starting point instead of $353,704.25 (i.e., $465,787.75-$112,083).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court, the jury's error was almost certainly attributable to counsels' \"casual treatment of the evidence pertaining to damages.\"  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 900.   The figures show that the jury likely committed this oversight.  If we take the higher figure, deduct $15,000 for expenses<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and divide the difference ($450,787.75) by two, the quotient (i.e., plaintiff's \"prima facie\" loss) comes out to approximately $225,000--the amount actually awarded by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second defect in the damage award identified by the district court was the jury's apparent failure to reduce plaintiff's damages by the amount plaintiff earned after his discharge on June 30, 1989, and before the termination of the Dupont trial in December 1991.  It was undisputed that plaintiff earned approximately $50,000 in 1990 and $40,000 in 1991 from court reporting sources.  There was no direct testimony as to plaintiff's court reporting income for the balance of 1989.  Because Puerto Rico law requires that a damage award be reduced by the amount of the plaintiff's gain during the remaining life of the contract, the jury's failure to do so here resulted in an excessive damage award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After scanning the trial record, we agree with the district court that these deficiencies infected the jury's damage calculation and resulted in an excessive damage award. Therefore, a new trial or a partial remittitur was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the remittitur, plaintiff argues that he was willing to remit a lesser amount, and that the court's remittitur was excessive.  The rule in this circuit for computing a remittitur is the \"least intrusive\" standard.  See Catullo, 834 F.2d at 1083;  see also Earl v. Bouchard Transp. Co., 917 F.2d 1320, 1328 (2d Cir.1990) (explaining three different rules for computing remittitur and adopting the least intrusive method).  Under this standard, the remittitur amount should reduce the verdict \"only to the maximum that would be upheld by the trial court as not excessive.\"  Earl, 917 F.2d at 1330.   The district court used this standard in calculating its remittitur.  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 902-03.   We can find nothing in the record to substantiate plaintiff's claim that the trial judge abused his discretion by remitting the amount that he did, $140,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our discussion above indicates, see supra, p. 397, the maximum amount of plaintiff's prima facie loss supported by the evidence was $169,350 (i.e., ($353,705-$15,000)/2).  Under Puerto Rico law, this figure must be reduced by the minimum amount of mitigation proved by defendant at trial, approximately $90,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Consequently, we are left with a maximum damage award of approximately $80,000.  Plaintiff's attack on the amount left in place by the district court, $85,000, is therefore without force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Mitigation of Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff maintains that he is entitled to a third trial on damages because the district court improperly admitted, at both trials, evidence pertaining to the issue of mitigation of damages.  According to plaintiff this constituted reversible error because the defendant never pleaded mitigation as an affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that defendant did not plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense in his complaint.  Nor does it appear that the issue was addressed in any pretrial orders prior to the first trial.  Plaintiff did, however, include a proposed jury instruction concerning mitigation of damages in his proposed charge submitted in anticipation of the first trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first trial, the issue of mitigation was initially raised during defense counsel's cross-examination of plaintiff, when he asked plaintiff about income from court reporting sources subsequent to being discharged.  At no time during this line of questioning did plaintiff's counsel object on the grounds that the defendant had waived this defense by failing to plead it in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c).  The sole objections raised by plaintiff's counsel were that the questions exceeded the scope of the direct examination, and that plaintiff's income was not pertinent to the case.  At the end of the trial, the district court instructed the jury, without objection from plaintiff, on the doctrine of mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court granted defendant's postjudgment motion, plaintiff moved for reconsideration based in part on defendant's failure to plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense.  The district court denied the motion on the ground that, \"mitigation was referred to repeatedly during trial and in the Court's instructions to the Jury without any objection being interposed by plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' conduct during trial amounted in our opinion to a waiver of the ground they now assert.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between the first and second trials, defendant engaged in extensive discovery on the issue of mitigation of damages.  Questions concerning mitigation were posed by defendant in written interrogatories and at plaintiff's deposition.  Both parties retained experts (certified public accountants) who authored reports on plaintiff's damages, and later testified at trial on the issue of mitigation.  Additionally, both parties submitted trial memoranda in which, at the court's direction, the issue of mitigation was briefed.  The parties also filed a joint trial memorandum in which plaintiff included, among his claims and defenses, the statement that \"[p]laintiffs made every effort to mitigate the damages caused by the breach of contract by defendants, but were set back by the unilateral termination of the contract by defendants, which affected plaintiffs' good name and reputation in the industry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in the opening statement plaintiff proposed that the judge give to the jury, he specifically asked the court to address the issue of mitigation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the amount due to plaintiffs is determined, then, you must consider[ ] whether or not plaintiffs had the duty to mitigate the damages suffered as a consequence of the breach of contract by defendants.  Also, you must consider the steps taken by plaintiffs to mitigate these damages.  Then, you must determine whether an amount for mitigation of damages, if any, is to be deducted from plaintiffs' award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in a proposed jury charge submitted prior to the second trial, plaintiff devoted seven instructions exclusively to the issue of mitigation of damages.  At no time during the activities leading up to the second trial did plaintiff argue that defendant had waived the defense of mitigation of damages by omitting it from his answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the opening day of the second trial, defendant moved to amend his answer, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b), to include mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense.  Plaintiff objected.  The court overruled plaintiff's objection and allowed the amendment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[O]n mitigation, the law of Puerto Rico and every other jurisdiction is so clear that prima facie damage for breach of contract places on the injured party the obligation to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is more than that.  It is that part of plaintiffs' proof in a breach of contract case, as in every case, is causation, liability, and liability causing damage to the extent that an injured plaintiff can avoid that damage by working himself.  To that extent his damage is not caused by the defendant, but is, rather, caused, if this is the evidence, by plaintiffs' failure to exert reasonable effort to make up for this loss of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, basically it is the defendants' burden to prove mitigation.  In the way this case stands the defendant will go forward and have the burden of proof.  But to eliminate from the case the mitigation issue, and implicitly, the importance of the plaintiff establishing causation between liability and damage requires, in my view, the amendment of the pleading that the defendant has proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Second Trial, Vol.  I, pp. 34-35.  At the start of the third and final day of trial, after the issue of mitigation had been litigated, the court revisited its prior ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Court now vacates its allowance ... [of] defendant's motion to amend its answer by adding the affirmative defense of mitigation of damages.  This order does not affect the evidence at this trial or the evidence that will go to the jury, but, rather, the state of the pleadings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Second Trial, Vol.  III, p. 3.  The court then explained that defendant was not required to plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense, and that the court had granted defendant's motion to amend because it did not think that the amendment had any real significance.  The court added, however, that it realized that there was support for the position that mitigation was an affirmative defense.  Therefore, the court \"un-amended\" defendant's answer so that plaintiff could raise the present issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its $20,000 verdict, plaintiff moved to set aside the judgment based primarily on the trial court's admission of mitigation evidence.  The court denied the motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first trial plaintiffs offered evidence of damage to their reputation for having been \"kicked out of Puerto Rico\", which was relevant only to mitigation and did not object to instructions submitting the issue to the jury.  The retrial on damages was preceded by abundant discovery as to mitigation, at the Court's direction the parties briefed the law applicable to this issue and both parties called alleged experts to testify about plaintiffs' actual and potential earnings.  In our opinion any error in the Court's reception of evidence on mitigation could not have been prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conjugal Partnership Comprised by Jones v. Conjugal Partnership Comprised by Pineda, No. 90-1051 (D.Mass. Dec. 15, 1992) (order denying motion to set aside new judgment).  We review plaintiff's claim of error against this backdrop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some question as to whether or not we should look to state law in determining if failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> compare Sayre v. Musicland Group, Inc., 850 F.2d 350, 354 (8th Cir.1988) (whether mitigation is an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) is a federal procedural matter and is governed by the federal rules), with 999 v. C.I.T. Corp., 776 F.2d 866, 870 n. 2 (9th Cir.1985) (citing California law for the proposition that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c)).  We need not, however, dwell on this dilemma.  Failure to mitigate is an affirmative defense as a matter of federal procedural law, see Lennon v. U.S. Theatre Corp., 920 F.2d 996, 1000 (D.C.Cir.1990);  Modern Leasing v. Falcon Mfg. of California, 888 F.2d 59, 62 (8th Cir.1989), as well as Puerto Rico law, see Odriozola v. S. Cosmetic Dist. Corp., 116 D.P.R. 485 (1985), and therefore must be pleaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, failure to plead an affirmative defense results in a waiver of the defense and the exclusion of all evidence relevant to it.  See Federal Deposit Ins. Co. v. Ramirez-Rivera, 869 F.2d 624, 626 (1st Cir.1989);  Depositors Trust Co. v. Slobusky, 692 F.2d 205, 208 (1st Cir.1982).  Nevertheless, it is settled that \"[w]hen there is no prejudice and when fairness dictates, the strictures of [the raise or waive] rule may be relaxed.\"  Jakobsen v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 520 F.2d 810, 813 (1st Cir.1975).  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> the trial court may and should liberally allow amendments to the pleadings if prejudice does not result.  Id.  Moreover, when an affirmative defense that has not been raised in the pleadings has actually been tried by implied consent of the parties, the court must treat the defense as if it had been raised in the original responsive pleading.  Id.; Depositors Trust Co., 692 F.2d at 208.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first trial, it is clear that the issue of mitigation was actually tried with plaintiff's implied consent.  \"One sign of implied consent is that issues not raised by the pleadings are presented and argued without proper objection by opposing counsel.\"  Matter of Prescott, 805 F.2d 719, 725 (7th Cir.1986) (citing cases).  Under Rule 15(b), lack of consent is manifested by an objection on the ground that the evidence is not within the issues raised by the pleadings.  Id.; Hardin v. Manitowoc-Forsythe Corp., 691 F.2d 449, 457 (10th Cir.1982).  Here, defendant's mitigation evidence was presented without relevant objection by plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, implied consent is generally found where the opposing party actually produced evidence on the new issue.  See Law v. Ernst &amp; Young, 956 F.2d 364, 375 (1st Cir.1992);  Lynch v. Dukakis, 719 F.2d 504, 508 (1st Cir.1983);  Hardin, 691 F.2d at 457;  see generally 6A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1493 at 28 (1990) (citing cases).  Here, as the district court noted, plaintiff's testimony concerning alleged damage to his reputation within court reporting circles was relevant only to the issue of mitigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, plaintiff did not object to that portion of the jury charge concerning mitigation of damages.  See Zappia v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., 312 F.2d 62, 64 (6th Cir.1963) (implied consent found where party did not object to jury instruction on unpleaded issue).  Finally, plaintiff never asked for a continuance in order to meet the evidence of mitigation, nor did he allege any prejudice resulting from the court's admission of the mitigation evidence at the first trial.  Rhode Island Educ. v. Secretary U.S. Dep't of Educ., 929 F.2d 844, 855 (1st Cir.1991) (unpleaded issue properly raised where opposing party failed to argue prejudice);  George Cohen Sons &amp; Co. v. Koch, 376 F.2d 629, 632-33 (1st Cir.1967) (claim tried by implied consent of the parties where opposing party failed to seek a continuance to meet evidence on unpleaded issue).  Moreover, in light of the fact that plaintiff, prior to trial, submitted a proposed jury instruction on the doctrine of mitigation, we can reasonably conclude that plaintiff anticipated that the issue would be litigated, and consequently was not prejudiced when it was raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning our attention to the second trial, we reach the same conclusion.  We note, however, that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that mitigation of damages is not an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c).  Nevertheless, because we affirm the court's ruling that the issue of mitigation was properly litigated, its error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hornbook law that, \" 'at the trial stage the case is to be heard on the merits, and is not to be hamstrung by faulty pleadings, unless actual, not conjectural, prejudice results from the faulty pleadings.' \"  Green v. United States, 629 F.2d 581, 584 n. 1 (9th Cir.1980) (quoting 2A James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 8.05 at 8-34 (2d ed. 1979)).  Because the issue of mitigation was the subject of substantial pretrial activity, plaintiff had ample notice that the defense of mitigation would be litigated at the second trial.  Consequently, the district court's decision to admit the mitigation evidence and allow the issue to be litigated was proper.  See Pane v. RCA Corp., 868 F.2d 631, 637 (3d Cir.1989) (where unpleaded affirmative defense was referred to repeatedly in pretrial motions and no unfair surprise resulted, district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the issue to be litigated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered plaintiff's other claims--particularly those concerning the trial court's denial of his motion for sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, the court's decision to stay the execution of judgment after the first trial, and its refusal to compel discovery of defendant's personal financial papers--and find them to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> More precisely, the plaintiffs-appellants in this case are the conjugal partnership comprising Joseph Jones and his wife Vernetta, who worked together as Stenograph Systems, Inc.

Fuste.  The position was offered for a one-year term, and Jones left Judge Fuste's employ as scheduled in March 1988.  Shortly thereafter, defendant Pineda, the official court reporter for federal district judge Raymond L. Acosta, offered Jones a lucrative opportunity.  Judge Acosta was the presiding judge in the San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation, a complex multi-plaintiff case which promised a lengthy trial during which the attorneys would require daily transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pineda realized that he and his wife, who was not a court reporter but aided her husband in producing the transcripts, would be unable to handle this task alone.  After some preliminary discussions, Pineda and Jones reached an oral agreement whereby Pineda agreed to hire Jones \"for the entire length of the Dupont trial,\" during which they would split all of the court reporting duties and fees.  Jones agreed to remain in Puerto Rico until the trial ended, and further agreed to get a letter of reference from Judge Fuste.  Subsequently, Pineda sought Judge Acosta's approval, which was reluctantly given, for hiring Jones.  Apparently Jones had transcribed several pretrial conferences in the Dupont case, and Judge Acosta was not impressed with his reporting skills.  Nonetheless, given Pineda's repeated assurances, Judge Acosta acquiesced to Jones' participation for \"phase I\" of the Dupont trial.  But, Pineda never informed Jones that Judge Acosta's authorization was a condition precedent to the oral contract, or that revocation of the judge's approval would result in the contract's termination.  And, Pineda never informed Judge Acosta that he had hired Jones for the duration of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dupont trial was scheduled to proceed in discrete \"phases.\"   Phase I began in March 1989 and lasted for thirty-three days.  Jones and Pineda shared the workload and the fees generated by phase I.  Phase II commenced on June 27, 1989, and lasted until December 1990.  The trial ended in December 1991.  Pineda terminated Jones on June 30, 1989, and told Jones that he made too many mistakes and was slowing things down.  Earlier that day Pineda had voiced similar concerns about Jones to Judge Acosta who agreed that Jones should no longer work on the case and revoked his prior authorization.  Pineda told Jones that he (Pineda), and not Judge Acosta was responsible for Jones' discharge.  There was evidence that on June 29, the day before Jones was terminated, a new system was developed for linking the in-court stenograph machine to a computer located outside of the courtroom, enabling one reporter (Pineda) to handle the reporting work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his work on phase I of the trial, Jones received, $49,108.00, or approximately $1,500 for each of the thirty-three sessions.  This represents half of the total fees paid for reporting services during phase I, $112,083, less expenses.

Plaintiff insists, however, that this is a state law breach of contract action that was properly filed in superior court and should have remained there.  We disagree.  By raising a colorable federal defense, a defendant-official converts an otherwise nonremovable state law action into one that falls within the federal court's jurisdiction.  See Mesa, 489 U.S. at 136-37, 109 S.Ct. at 968-69.   The federal officer removal statute does not require that the case be one that could have originally been filed in federal court.  Williams v.

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>\"the measure of damages sustained by reason of failure on the part of an employer to comply with a contract for services is, prima facie, the compensation stipulated in the contract, subject to reduction upon proof by the defendant as to the amount the employee did gain or could have gained during the time the contract remained in force.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villar &amp; Co. v.

This standard was correctly identified by the district court.  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the district court engaged in a detailed examination of the evidence pertaining to damages, and concluded that the jury's excessive generosity was traceable to two errors.  First, the court determined that the jury, in computing plaintiff's damages, failed to deduct the fees generated during phase I of the Dupont trial, $112,083 (of which plaintiff received his share), from the total fees earned during the entire trial, $465,787.75.  Therefore, the jury used $465,787.75 as a starting point instead of $353,704.25 (i.e., $465,787.75-$112,083).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court, the jury's error was almost certainly attributable to counsels' \"casual treatment of the evidence pertaining to damages.\"  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 900.   The figures show that the jury likely committed this oversight.  If we take the higher figure, deduct $15,000 for expenses<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and divide the difference ($450,787.75) by two, the quotient (i.e., plaintiff's \"prima facie\" loss) comes out to approximately $225,000--the amount actually awarded by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second defect in the damage award identified by the district court was the jury's apparent failure to reduce plaintiff's damages by the amount plaintiff earned after his discharge on June 30, 1989, and before the termination of the Dupont trial in December 1991.  It was undisputed that plaintiff earned approximately $50,000 in 1990 and $40,000 in 1991 from court reporting sources.  There was no direct testimony as to plaintiff's court reporting income for the balance of 1989.  Because Puerto Rico law requires that a damage award be reduced by the amount of the plaintiff's gain during the remaining life of the contract, the jury's failure to do so here resulted in an excessive damage award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After scanning the trial record, we agree with the district court that these deficiencies infected the jury's damage calculation and resulted in an excessive damage award. Therefore, a new trial or a partial remittitur was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the remittitur, plaintiff argues that he was willing to remit a lesser amount, and that the court's remittitur was excessive.  The rule in this circuit for computing a remittitur is the \"least intrusive\" standard.  See Catullo, 834 F.2d at 1083;  see also Earl v. Bouchard Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550864\"><a href=\"/opinion/550864/james-c-earl-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-bouchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (2d Cir.1990) (explaining three different rules for computing remittitur and adopting the least intrusive method).  Under this standard, the remittitur amount should reduce the verdict \"only to the maximum that would be upheld by the trial court as not excessive.\"  Earl, 917 F.2d at 1330.   The district court used this standard in calculating its remittitur.  Conjugal I, 798 F.Supp. at 902-03.   We can find nothing in the record to substantiate plaintiff's claim that the trial judge abused his discretion by remitting the amount that he did, $140,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our discussion above indicates, see supra, p. 397, the maximum amount of plaintiff's prima facie loss supported by the evidence was $169,350 (i.e., ($353,705-$15,000)/2).  Under Puerto Rico law, this figure must be reduced by the minimum amount of mitigation proved by defendant at trial, approximately $90,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Consequently, we are left with a maximum damage award of approximately $80,000.  Plaintiff's attack on the amount left in place by the district court, $85,000, is therefore without force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Mitigation of Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff maintains that he is entitled to a third trial on damages because the district court improperly admitted, at both trials, evidence pertaining to the issue of mitigation of damages.  According to plaintiff this constituted reversible error because the defendant never pleaded mitigation as an affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that defendant did not plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense in his complaint.  Nor does it appear that the issue was addressed in any pretrial orders prior to the first trial.  Plaintiff did, however, include a proposed jury instruction concerning mitigation of damages in his proposed charge submitted in anticipation of the first trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first trial, the issue of mitigation was initially raised during defense counsel's cross-examination of plaintiff, when he asked plaintiff about income from court reporting sources subsequent to being discharged.  At no time during this line of questioning did plaintiff's counsel object on the grounds that the defendant had waived this defense by failing to plead it in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c).  The sole objections raised by plaintiff's counsel were that the questions exceeded the scope of the direct examination, and that plaintiff's income was not pertinent to the case.  At the end of the trial, the district court instructed the jury, without objection from plaintiff, on the doctrine of mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court granted defendant's postjudgment motion, plaintiff moved for reconsideration based in part on defendant's failure to plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense.  The district court denied the motion on the ground that, \"mitigation was referred to repeatedly during trial and in the Court's instructions to the Jury without any objection being interposed by plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' conduct during trial amounted in our opinion to a waiver of the ground they now assert.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between the first and second trials, defendant engaged in extensive discovery on the issue of mitigation of damages.  Questions concerning mitigation were posed by defendant in written interrogatories and at plaintiff's deposition.  Both parties retained experts (certified public accountants) who authored reports on plaintiff's damages, and later testified at trial on the issue of mitigation.  Additionally, both parties submitted trial memoranda in which, at the court's direction, the issue of mitigation was briefed.  The parties also filed a joint trial memorandum in which plaintiff included, among his claims and defenses, the statement that \"[p]laintiffs made every effort to mitigate the damages caused by the breach of contract by defendants, but were set back by the unilateral termination of the contract by defendants, which affected plaintiffs' good name and reputation in the industry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in the opening statement plaintiff proposed that the judge give to the jury, he specifically asked the court to address the issue of mitigation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the amount due to plaintiffs is determined, then, you must consider[ ] whether or not plaintiffs had the duty to mitigate the damages suffered as a consequence of the breach of contract by defendants.  Also, you must consider the steps taken by plaintiffs to mitigate these damages.  Then, you must determine whether an amount for mitigation of damages, if any, is to be deducted from plaintiffs' award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in a proposed jury charge submitted prior to the second trial, plaintiff devoted seven instructions exclusively to the issue of mitigation of damages.  At no time during the activities leading up to the second trial did plaintiff argue that defendant had waived the defense of mitigation of damages by omitting it from his answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the opening day of the second trial, defendant moved to amend his answer, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b), to include mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense.  Plaintiff objected.  The court overruled plaintiff's objection and allowed the amendment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[O]n mitigation, the law of Puerto Rico and every other jurisdiction is so clear that prima facie damage for breach of contract places on the injured party the obligation to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is more than that.  It is that part of plaintiffs' proof in a breach of contract case, as in every case, is causation, liability, and liability causing damage to the extent that an injured plaintiff can avoid that damage by working himself.  To that extent his damage is not caused by the defendant, but is, rather, caused, if this is the evidence, by plaintiffs' failure to exert reasonable effort to make up for this loss of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, basically it is the defendants' burden to prove mitigation.  In the way this case stands the defendant will go forward and have the burden of proof.  But to eliminate from the case the mitigation issue, and implicitly, the importance of the plaintiff establishing causation between liability and damage requires, in my view, the amendment of the pleading that the defendant has proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Second Trial, Vol.  I, pp. 34-35.  At the start of the third and final day of trial, after the issue of mitigation had been litigated, the court revisited its prior ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Court now vacates its allowance ... [of] defendant's motion to amend its answer by adding the affirmative defense of mitigation of damages.  This order does not affect the evidence at this trial or the evidence that will go to the jury, but, rather, the state of the pleadings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Second Trial, Vol.  III, p. 3.  The court then explained that defendant was not required to plead mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense, and that the court had granted defendant's motion to amend because it did not think that the amendment had any real significance.  The court added, however, that it realized that there was support for the position that mitigation was an affirmative defense.  Therefore, the court \"un-amended\" defendant's answer so that plaintiff could raise the present issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its $20,000 verdict, plaintiff moved to set aside the judgment based primarily on the trial court's admission of mitigation evidence.  The court denied the motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first trial plaintiffs offered evidence of damage to their reputation for having been \"kicked out of Puerto Rico\", which was relevant only to mitigation and did not object to instructions submitting the issue to the jury.  The retrial on damages was preceded by abundant discovery as to mitigation, at the Court's direction the parties briefed the law applicable to this issue and both parties called alleged experts to testify about plaintiffs' actual and potential earnings.  In our opinion any error in the Court's reception of evidence on mitigation could not have been prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conjugal Partnership Comprised by Jones v.

Here, as the district court noted, plaintiff's testimony concerning alleged damage to his reputation within court reporting circles was relevant only to the issue of mitigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, plaintiff did not object to that portion of the jury charge concerning mitigation of damages.  See Zappia v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R.

Moreover, in light of the fact that plaintiff, prior to trial, submitted a proposed jury instruction on the doctrine of mitigation, we can reasonably conclude that plaintiff anticipated that the issue would be litigated, and consequently was not prejudiced when it was raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning our attention to the second trial, we reach the same conclusion.  We note, however, that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that mitigation of damages is not an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c).  Nevertheless, because we affirm the court's ruling that the issue of mitigation was properly litigated, its error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hornbook law that, \" 'at the trial stage the case is to be heard on the merits, and is not to be hamstrung by faulty pleadings, unless actual, not conjectural, prejudice results from the faulty pleadings.' \"  Green v.

Because the issue of mitigation was the subject of substantial pretrial activity, plaintiff had ample notice that the defense of mitigation would be litigated at the second trial.  Consequently, the district court's decision to admit the mitigation evidence and allow the issue to be litigated was proper.  See Pane v.
