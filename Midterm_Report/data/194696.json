Sheldon Yefsky was convicted\n                                 \n\nby a jury of  a dual-object conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n   371 and  1341, and of four counts of  mail fraud, unrelated to\n\nthe conspiracy,  in violation of  18 U.S.C.    1341.  On  appeal,\n\nYefsky raises a number of challenges to his conviction.  After an\n\nexhaustive review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n     We   begin  with  a  brief  description  of  the  facts  and\n\nproceedings.\n\n     The Greater  Boston Police Council (GBPC) was  formed in the\n\nearly 1960s as a mutual aid society for various metropolitan area\n\nlaw enforcement  agencies.    The  GBPC enabled  its  members  to\n\npurchase equipment  at  reduced  prices  pursuant  to  collective\n\npurchase agreements.  As  an unincorporated association, the GBPC\n\nrelied on one of its members to act as its fiduciary agent.  \n\n     At  all times  relevant to  this case,  the Town  of Newton,\n\nwhose police chief William Quinn served as the chair of the GBPC,\n\nfulfilled that role.   Quinn, in turn, relied heavily  on Timothy\n\nCoogan, a civilian employee of the police department, to  conduct\n\nthe  daily operations  of the  GBPC.   Coogan became  a full-time\n\nemployee  after   graduating  from  law  school   and  ended  his\n\naffiliation with Newton in mid-1985, when the offenses underlying\n\nthis case surfaced.\n\n     A  primary  concern of  the GBPC  was  the inability  of the\n\nmember  police  departments to  communicate  with  each other  by\n\nradio.   To solve this  problem, the GBPC  undertook a project to\n\ndevelop  an integrated radio system for its members.  This system\n\nbecame known  as the Boston  Area Police Emergency  Radio Network\n\n(BAPERN).  \n\n     In  1975, the GBPC hired  a Chicago-based firm, Computer and\n\nEngineering  Services (CES),  of  which Yefsky  is president,  to\n\nassess  the  existing radio  systems.   One  year later,  CES was\n\nawarded a bid contract of $31,000 to design and implement BAPERN.\n\nThe  system used  Motorola equipment,  which  was available  at a\n\ndiscount through a GBPC collective purchase contract.  \n\n     By June  1978, BAPERN  was fully operational,  connecting 23\n\ncities  and  towns, and  Coogan  had  became the  BAPERN  project\n\ndirector  and general counsel and administrator for the GBPC.  In\n\nthese capacities, Coogan  exercised financial and  administrative\n\ncontrol  of  GBPC  affairs,  including the  BAPERN  project.   He\n\nencouraged organizations  to join  BAPERN and recommended  CES to\n\nthem  for  engineering and  design work.   Coogan  alone received\n\nshipping  orders  from  BAPERN  members  to  the  GBPC,  prepared\n\nGBPC/Newton  shipping  orders  to  CES  and   Motorola,  approved\n\ninvoices from  these businesses  to the GBPC/Newton  for payment,\n\nprepared bills  from the GBPC/Newton  to the BAPERN  members, and\n\nreceived  the  members'  payments.   Newton  officials, including\n\nQuinn,  merely  rubber stamped  his work.    Coogan was,  in many\n\nrespects, the person most identified with the GBPC. \n\n     In  1985,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  began  an\n\ninvestigation of  Coogan, which revealed large  amounts of income\n\nthat he  had not  reported to  the  IRS.   The unreported  income\n\n                               -3-\n\nstemmed  from two  sources.   First,  Coogan  had become  a  paid\n\nconsultant  to  International  Telecommunications  Service,  Inc.\n\n(ITS),  a subsidiary of CES, to perform engineering field work on\n\nthe  BAPERN system.  Second,  Coogan had overcharged GBPC members\n\nfor radio equipment and  had diverted the overcharge to  a secret\n\nbank account for his personal use.\n\n     In  1989,  Coogan,  Yefsky,  his  son  Michael  Yefsky,  the\n\npresident of ITS,  and Samuel Diamond, the financial  officer and\n\ntax preparer for CES and ITS, were charged with numerous criminal\n\nviolations stemming from their involvement in the BAPERN project.\n\nThe indictment charged  the existence of two  separate schemes to\n\ndefraud members of  the GBPC  and charged Coogan  alone with  tax\n\nfraud  for  concealing  his  illicit profits  from  both  schemes\n\n(Counts 2-4).  \n\n     The first scheme charged was a conspiracy involving all four\n\ndefendants (Count  1).  The goals  of the conspiracy were  to pay\n\nCoogan  kickbacks for sending engineering work to CES and to help\n\nhim hide  that income  from  the IRS.    The kickbacks  were  the\n\npayments ITS made  to Coogan, allegedly  for his field  services.\n\nAt  trial,  the  government  explained that  the  kickbacks  were\n\nfinanced by  charging GBPC members for  engineering services that\n\nwere  unnecessary or  never were performed or by overcharging for\n\nwork actually done.\n\n     The second intrigue implicated  Coogan and Yefsky in a  mail\n\nfraud scheme based on  the equipment overcharge and  diversion of\n\nfunds  for Coogan's personal  use (Counts 5-14).   The government\n\n                               -4-\n\nconsistently has admitted  that this was  a scheme distinct  from\n\nthe  engineering conspiracy.   The  mailing of  ten payments  for\n\nequipment, maintenance fees, and  BAPERN expansion fees by member\n\norganizations comprised the individual mail fraud counts.\n\n     A  tedious and  rambling  trial stretching  86 days  ensued.\n\nOver 1000 exhibits were  admitted, with more than half  subjected\n\nto  limitations as  to the  various counts  and defendants.   The\n\ngovernment alone consumed 44 days and 878 exhibits to present its\n\ncase-in-chief.  Yefsky used  another 24 days and 376  exhibits to\n\npresent  his defense.  The thrust of  his defense was that he did\n\nnot join in either the conspiracy or the equipment scheme but was\n\na pawn of Coogan.\n\n     At the trial's  conclusion, the jury convicted Coogan of all\n\n14 counts against  him.   It convicted Yefsky  of the  conspiracy\n\ncount  and 4  of the  10 mail  fraud counts.   It  also convicted\n\nMichael  Yefsky  and Diamond  of the  conspiracy count,  the only\n\ncharge against them.  \n\n     During the proceedings below,  Yefsky made many motions, the\n\ndecisions of which form the bases  of this appeal.  These motions\n\ninclude  a motion  for acquittal  based on  insufficiency of  the\n\nevidence; a  motion to  dismiss the indictment  for insufficiency\n\nand  double  jeopardy; a  motion  for severance;  and  an omnibus\n\nmotion for a new  trial that reiterated  many of these issues  as\n\nwell as errors at trial.\n\n     Yefsky, his  son,  and Diamond  appealed their  convictions.\n\nThe government  then conceded  the insufficiency of  the evidence\n\n                               -5-\n\nsupporting the convictions of Michael Yefsky and Diamond, and the\n\nverdicts  against them  were  set aside  and  dismissed.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Yefsky, Memorandum and Order, Nos. 90-1222,  -1240 (1st\n                \n\nCir.  Jan.  29, 1993).   Coogan  did  not appeal  his conviction.\n\nYefsky's appeal remains, and we turn now to the issues he raises.\n\n                               II.\n\n     Yefsky contends that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion, renewed  at  close  of  trial,  for  acquittal  based  on\n\ninsufficiency  of   evidence.    When  reviewing   a  motion  for\n\nacquittal, we  consider the evidence in the  light most favorable\n\nto the prosecution.  United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520,\n                                                  \n\n527  (1st Cir.  1988).   We,  therefore,  \"draw[] all  legitimate\n\ninferences  and resolv[e] all credibility determinations in favor\n\nof the verdict.\"  United  States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169,  1197\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\nA.  The Conspiracy Count\n                        \n\n     To  support a verdict of guilt, the evidence must prove each\n\nelement  of  a  conspiracy  beyond a  reasonable  doubt.    These\n\nelements  are  the existence  of  a  conspiracy, the  defendant's\n\nknowledge of it, and  his voluntary participation in it.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  David, 940 F.2d  722, 735 (1st  Cir. 1991).   To prove\n                \n\nvoluntary  participation,  the  government  must  show  that  the\n\ndefendant intended both to agree with his  co-conspirators and to\n\ncommit  the  substantive  offense.    Id.    Moreover,  when  the\n                                         \n\ncommission  of  mail  fraud is  a  goal  of  the conspiracy,  the\n\ngovernment must  show either an  intent to use  the mails or  the\n\n                               -6-\n\nreasonable foreseeability of  such use.   United States v.  Dray,\n                                                                \n\n901  F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st  Cir. 1990).  We turn  now to the facts\n\nthat the jury reasonably could find in support of the verdict. \n\n     In  1979,  the relationships  among  the  GBPC, Coogan,  and\n\nYefsky  changed, allowing  the conspiracy  to germinate.   First,\n\nCoogan  was forced  to leave  regular employment with  the Newton\n\nPolice  Department  because  he  was maintaining  a  private  law\n\npractice.   He became instead a consultant to the Department and,\n\nin 1980, to  the GBPC.   His duties, however, remained  the same:\n\nassistant   to  Quinn   (as   police  chief   and  GBPC   chair),\n\nadministrator of  and general  counsel to  the GBPC,  and project\n\ndirector  of BAPERN.  In addition, his contracts permitted him to\n\nengage in other telecommunications consulting work.\n\n     Second,  government funding  and  oversight  of  the  BAPERN\n\nproject  ended.   Coogan then  prepared an  open-ended consulting\n\ncontract  for CES that defined  its role during  the expansion of\n\nBAPERN.  The new  contract called for CES to  provide engineering\n\nservices as requested by shipping orders issued through Newton on\n\nbehalf of the GBPC members.\n\n     The CES  contract did not  permit CES to  use subcontractors\n\nwithout written  consent from  Newton.  Nonetheless,  in December\n\n1979, CES entered a contract with ITS  by which ITS would perform\n\nfield  implementation  studies  and   services  for  various  CES\n\nprojects, including  BAPERN, and CES would pay ITS's salaries and\n\noverhead expenses.  \n\n                               -7-\n\n     At some point during  this period, Coogan approached Yefsky,\n\nproposing  to become  CES's local  \"clerk of  the works\"  for the\n\nBAPERN project.  In December 1979, Coogan entered a contract with\n\nITS to provide field  engineering; site, installation and testing\n\nsupervision;  and  training for  the  BAPERN  expansion.   Unlike\n\nYefsky's other  subcontractors, Coogan was paid a fixed price for\n\neach project  on which he worked  and was not  required to submit\n\ntime  sheets to corroborate his  fee.  Neither  Yefsky nor Coogan\n\never  revealed their  subcontracting  relationship  to the  GBPC.\n\nCoogan, in fact, repeatedly denied to Chief Quinn engaging in any\n\noutside telecommunications consulting work.  \n\n     From 1980  to mid-1985, 25  to 30  organizations joined  the\n\nBAPERN  system.   Coogan  recommended CES  to  many of  them  for\n\nengineering work.  As a result, CES's  income skyrocketed; during\n\nthis  period,  the  firm   received  approximately  $964,000  for\n\nengineering services relating to  BAPERN.  More than half  of the\n\npayments were for field work billed by Coogan.   Coogan, in turn,\n\nreceived approximately $484,760  from ITS for his  services.  CES\n\nreimbursed  ITS for  this and other  expenses, pursuant  to their\n\nsubcontract.\n\n     Many  of  the  payments  for engineering  were  inflated  or\n\nunnecessary.  Yefsky  himself testified that he had not performed\n\nwork  for  some  of the  police  departments  that  had paid  for\n\nengineering  services.   Some departments  also paid more  to the\n\nGBPC than CES had billed  GBPC.  Payments routinely were sent  to\n\nthe GBPC by mail.\n\n                               -8-\n\n     Coogan did  not report his ITS  income to the IRS.   Nor did\n\nITS  file Forms 1099 with the IRS  to reflect payments to Coogan.\n\nITS  did, however, list the consulting  fees as business expenses\n\non  its corporate tax returns.   CES also  listed its payments to\n\nITS as business expenses.1\n\n     From these facts, the jury reasonably could draw a series of\n\ninferences  to  connect Yefsky  to the  mail  fraud prong  of the\n\nconspiracy.   The jury could find that, once government oversight\n\nended, Coogan and Yefsky grasped an opportunity to make money out\n\nof the BAPERN project.  Thus,  it could find that Coogan  drafted\n\nthe open-ended CES contract  so that CES could pay  him kickbacks\n\nto steer  work orders to  CES.  It  also could find that  CES and\n\nCoogan  financed  the kickbacks  by  charging  inflated fees  for\n\nengineering work actually performed  or completely false fees for\n\nwork never  performed.   Accordingly, the  jury  could find  that\n\nYefsky and Coogan agreed  to enrich themselves by  defrauding the\n\nmembers of BAPERN.\n\n     Because we find the  evidence sufficient to support Yefsky's\n\nconviction of  conspiring to  commit  mail fraud,  we uphold  his\n\nconviction on Count 1 without  considering the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence  supporting the tax fraud object.  See Griffin v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 112 S.  Ct. 466, 473-74  (1991) (evidence supporting  one\n      \n\n                    \n\n     1   CES and ITS had  taken deductions for their  payments to\nCoogan.  But they were never indicted for tax fraud in connection\nwith the  kickback  scheme.    Although the  two  companies  were\naudited  by the  IRS, they  were not  required to  pay additional\ntaxes for the years in question.\n\n                               -9-\n\nobject  of  dual-object  conspiracy held  sufficient  to  support\n\nconspiracy conviction).  \n\nB.  The Mail Fraud Counts\n                         \n\n     The indictment charged  Yefsky and Coogan with ten counts of\n\nmail fraud  in connection  with the equipment  overcharge scheme.\n\nEach mailing  represented a  payment from  a  BAPERN member  that\n\nCoogan diverted to his secret bank account.  Yefsky was convicted\n\nof four of the ten counts.  \n\n     A conviction for mail fraud2  requires proof of two elements\n\nbeyond   a  reasonable   doubt.     They   are  the   defendant's\n\nparticipation in a  scheme to defraud and  the use of the  mails,\n\neither  by or  caused by  the defendants,  in furtherance  of the\n\nscheme.  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                                 \n\nThe  defendant  need  not instigate  the  scheme  so  long as  he\n\nwillfully  participates   in  it,  with  the   knowledge  of  its\n\nfraudulent  nature  and with  the intent  to achieve  its illicit\n\nobjectives.   Id. (citing United  States v. Price,  623 F.2d 587,\n                                                 \n\n591 (9th Cir. 1980)).  \n\n                    \n\n     2   The mail fraud  statute, 18 U.S.C.    1341, provides  in\nrelevant part:\n\n     Whoever,  having devised  or  intending  to devise  any\n     scheme or  artifice to defraud, or  for obtaining money\n     or property by means  of false or fraudulent pretenses,\n     representations, or promises, . . . for the purpose  of\n     executing such  scheme or artifice or  attempting so to\n     do  . . . takes  or receives [from  the Postal Service]\n     any such matter  or thing,  or knowingly  causes to  be\n     delivered by mail according  to the direction thereon .\n     . . shall be  fined not more than $1,000  or imprisoned\n     not more than five years, or both.\n\n                               -10-\n\n     A  mailing falls  within the  scope  of the  fraud if  it is\n\nsufficiently connected to the scheme to defraud and reasonably is\n\nforeseeable as  a result of  the participants'  actions.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.  Pacheco-Ortiz, 889  F.2d  301, 305  (1st  Cir. 1989);\n                         \n\nUnited States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir. 1987).  The\n                        \n\nmailing  of proceeds  of  a fraudulent  scheme  is sufficient  to\n\nuphold  a conviction  for mail fraud.   Silvano, 812  F.2d at 760\n                                               \n\n(citations omitted).  \n\n     Yefsky challenges the sufficiency of evidence linking him to\n\nthe scheme to defraud and to the mailings.  Because each count of\n\nwhich  he  was convicted  undisputedly  represents  a mailing  of\n\nproceeds of the scheme, Yefsky's convictions must be  affirmed if\n\nthe evidence  sufficiently  supports  his  participation  in  the\n\nscheme to overbill  for equipment.   We turn,  therefore, to  the\n\nevidence of Yefsky's participation in the equipment scheme.\n\n     In 1982, the  GBPC negotiated a  new contract with  Motorola\n\nfor the purchase  of equipment.   Yefsky assisted  Coogan in  the\n\nnegotiations,  which  resulted  in  deeper  discounts for  BAPERN\n\nmembers.    Coogan then  began  to bill  BAPERN  members inflated\n\nprices  for Motorola  equipment.   He also  provided false  price\n\nlists, representing  them as part  of the  Motorola contract,  to\n\ncorroborate the prices he charged.  A Motorola employee testified\n\nat trial that a comparison of Motorola bills with GBPC bills  for\n\nequipment revealed that Coogan  had overcharged BAPERN members by\n\nat least $888,000.\n\n                               -11-\n\n     Coogan deposited  the overcharge into a  bank account opened\n\nunder GBPC's name but without its knowledge or authorization.  He\n\nwas the  only  person  authorized  to withdraw  funds  from  this\n\naccount.   By December 1984, over $1.5 million had been deposited\n\ninto the account.   Coogan diverted this money for  personal use,\n\nsuch as purchasing certificates  of deposit and paying mortgages.\n\nThe  government  conceded at  oral  argument that  Yefsky  had no\n\nknowledge of this account and did  not share in the proceeds from\n\nthe overcharge.\n\n     Yefsky,  however,  was  present  at meetings  when  inflated\n\nprices  were quoted and discussed.  He also recommended the kinds\n\nof equipment to be purchased to organizations joining  BAPERN and\n\nincluded   inflated  price   lists,  obtained  from   Coogan,  in\n\nfeasibility studies he conducted for two organizations.\n\n     The facts  connecting Yefsky to the equipment scheme are not\n\nas  numerous   as  those   connecting  him  to   the  engineering\n\nconspiracy.   Nonetheless,  the jury  could conclude  that Yefsky\n\nknew that the equipment prices were being inflated because he had\n\nhelped to  negotiate the purchase agreement  that established the\n\nlegitimate prices.  It could conclude that Yefsky then joined the\n\nequipment scheme  by supporting and using  Coogan's quotations of\n\ninflated  prices.  It also could conclude that Yefsky entered the\n\nscheme   to  ensure   Coogan's  ongoing   participation  in   the\n\nengineering  conspiracy.     These  inferences   and  the   facts\n\nsupporting them are sufficient to sustain Yefsky's convictions of\n\nmail fraud.\n\n                               -12-\n\n                               III.\n\n     Yefsky  next  challenges  the adequacy  of  the  indictment,\n\nclaiming that the engineering fraud prong of the conspiracy count\n\nwas  defective because  it did  not specify  the  false pretenses\n\nused.3  He contends that this  defect deprived him of the ability\n\nto  present a meaningful defense.  The district court agreed that\n\nthe  count  did  not  specify  the false  pretenses  alleged  but\n\ndetermined  that the  indictment as  a whole  sufficiently warned\n\nYefsky  of  the  charges  against him.    Memorandum  and  Order,\n\nDecember 20,  1988, at  2.  It  therefore refused to  dismiss the\n\nengineering fraud count.   We disagree with  the district court's\n\ndecision but find its error harmless.\n\n     Rule  7(c)(1) of  the  Federal Rules  of Criminal  Procedure\n\nrequires an indictment to provide \"a plain,  concise and definite\n\nwritten statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\n\ncharged.\"  The Supreme Court has instructed that an indictment is\n\nsufficient  if it contains  the elements of  the offense charged,\n\nfairly informs the defendant of the charges against which he must\n\ndefend, and  enables him to enter  a plea without fear  of double\n\njeopardy.

Thus,  Yefsky's motion to dismiss Count 5\napplies on appeal to Count  1 of the superseding indictment.

United States, 273 U.S.  77, 81\n                                               \n\n(1927); United States v.

It urges  that  the challenged\n\ncount's  imprecision   regarding  the  mail  fraud  objective  is\n\nirrelevant.   Because the count  clearly charged an  agreement to\n                                                              \n\ndefraud  by use of the  mails, the government  argues that Yefsky\n\nwas able to prepare a defense to the conspiracy charge.\n\n     We disagree.  \"`Where guilt depends so crucially upon such a\n                                                                 \n\nspecific identification  of fact,  our cases have  uniformly held\n                                \n\nthat an indictment must  do more than simply repeat  the language\n\nof the criminal  statute.'\"   Hamling, 418 U.S.  at 118  (quoting\n                                     \n\nRussell  v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 764 (1962)) (emphasis in\n                         \n\nHamling).   We think a mail fraud conspiracy depends so crucially\n       \n\non the underlying fraud  that the fraud also must be specified in\n\nthe applicable count.\n\n                               -14-\n\n     We reach this conclusion based on the unusual nature of mail\n\nfraud.   A  multi-member  mail fraud  is  itself treated  like  a\n\nconspiracy.   See  Serrano,  870 F.2d  at  6 (multi-member  fraud\n                          \n\nrequires each member  to participate in common scheme with intent\n\nto  commit fraud); see  generally United  States v.

Thus, the  engineering\n\nconspiracy  count essentially  charged  Yefsky  with agreeing  to\n\ncommit  another conspiracy.4   Yefsky  could not  be expected  to\n\ndefend himself from a  charge of conspiring to join  a conspiracy\n\nto  perpetrate a  fraud if  the indictment  did not  identify the\n\nfraud that was the ultimate underlying offense.  \n\n     It is  undisputed that the engineering  conspiracy count did\n\nnot identify  the  plan used  to  defraud the  GBPC.   The  count\n\nalleged  only that Coogan had  used his control  over the GBPC to\n\narrange  CES's  open-ended  engineering contract  in  1979,  that\n\nCoogan  had signed a contract with ITS to provide field services,\n\nthat CES received approximately  $964,000 under its new contract,\n\nand that ITS paid Coogan $484,760.  None of these allegations, on\n\ntheir face, describe  fraudulent conduct.  The  count then stated\n\nin conclusory  language drawn from  the mail  fraud statute  that\n\nCoogan  had obtained  this money  from the  GBPC  members through\n\nfalse pretenses.  It  did not divulge  the factual basis of  this\n\n                    \n\n     4   Yefsky,  of course,  could have  been charged  with both\nconspiracy  to   commit  the  engineering  fraud   and  with  the\nsubstantive  mail fraud  without  risking double  jeopardy.   See\n                                                                 \ninfra Section VI.\n     \n\n                               -15-\n\naccusation.   Accordingly, the count did not  provide Yefsky with\n\nadequate notice of the  charge against him.  Cf.

The engineering conspiracy count did\n             \n\nnot incorporate  any of the allegations  underlying the equipment\n\nfraud  counts.  We therefore review it standing alone, and, as it\n\nwas written, the engineering conspiracy count was defective.\n\n     Indeed, there is no reason for the conspiracy count to refer\n\nto  the separate equipment fraud counts.  Although it makes sense\n\nto read a conspiracy  indictment as a whole when  the substantive\n\noffenses  also are  the objects  of the  conspiracy,   see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nFusaro, 708 F.2d at 23, the substantive mail fraud counts in this\n      \n\ncase did not flow  from the conspiracy count.   The substantively\n\ncharged  scheme   encompassed  overcharges  for   equipment,  not\n\nengineering, and, throughout trial, evidence of the two different\n\novercharges was limited to the  appropriate counts.  We  consider\n\nit disingenuous  of the  government to abandon  this distinction,\n\nwhich  it  repeatedly has  emphasized, when  the blurring  of the\n\nschemes conveniently serves a specific argument.\n\n     The  finding  of  error  does  not,  however,  conclude  our\n\ninquiry.    We still  must determine  whether  the defect  in the\n\nindictment prejudiced Yefsky.  Fusaro,  708 F.2d at 23 (citations\n                                     \n\nomitted).   Having reviewed the record  and considered the impact\n\nof  the error  on the  jury, we  conclude \"`with  fair assurance,\n\nafter pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous\n\naction  from  the  whole, that  the  [jurors']  judgment  was not\n\nsubstantially swayed by the error.'\"  United States v.

Months before trial,\n\nthe district  court's decision on his motion informed Yefsky that\n\n\"it  would  have  been  necessary  for the  defendant  to  charge\n\ninflated  rates  in  order  to  make  the  alleged  kickbacks  to\n\ndefendant  Coogan.\"   Memorandum and  Order at  2.   In addition,\n\ndocuments provided by  the government  during discovery  revealed\n\nthe  overcharges   that  formed  a  basis   for  the  engineering\n\nconspiracy.   Yefsky,  moreover,  took  24 days  to  present  his\n\ndefense, which thoroughly explored  his involvement in the BAPERN\n\nproject  and laid the blame for the engineering fraud at Coogan's\n\nfeet.   He thus had  ample opportunity to  rebut the government's\n\ncharges.  The defect, therefore, was harmless.\n\n                               IV.\n\n     Yefsky also  contends  that the  conspiracy  improperly  was\n\njoined  with  the  substantive  offenses  and  should  have  been\n\nsevered.   Alternatively, Yefsky  argues that, because  the joint\n\ntrial prejudiced him, the district court should have  severed the\n\ncounts and also  should have separated  his trial from  Coogan's.\n\nWe deal first with  the question of  joinder and second with  the\n\nquestion of severance.\n\nA.

Offenses may be charged jointly if the\n\nacts or transactions from which  they stem are related.  Fed.  R.\n\nCrim.  P. 8(a),  (b).    Yefsky  contends  that  joinder  of  the\n\nconspiracy, tax fraud, and mail fraud counts was improper because\n\neach set of offenses was comprised of a discrete  series of acts.\n\nThe district court determined that despite the distinct nature of\n\nthe three  offenses, the  acts underlying them  were sufficiently\n\nconnected for the offenses to be joined.  Memorandum and Order at\n\n3-5.    Our review  of  joinder  is plenary.    United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nNatanel,  938 F.2d  302, 306-07  (1st Cir.  1991) (citing  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

The engineering conspiracy  involved one scheme  to pay\n\nkickbacks to Coogan and to help  him evade tax liability; the tax\n\nfraud encompassed Coogan alone;  and the substantive fraud scheme\n\nentailed  a  distinct plot  to  inflate  equipment prices,  which\n\novercharge Coogan  alone pocketed.  The  conspiracy also predated\n\nthe equipment  overcharge scheme by  three years.   Yefsky argues\n\nthat the only common thread in  these charges is Coogan and  that\n\nthis single strand is too weak to bind the three offenses.  \n\n     There can be  no doubt  that the tax  fraud counts  properly\n\nwere  joined with either the conspiracy or the mail fraud counts.\n\nAs the district court noted, it is axiomatic that a defendant can\n\nbe  charged with both the conspiracy and the substantive offenses\n\n                               -19-\n\narising from it.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1990); United States  v.

In this  case, the conspiracy embraced  many of the acts\n\nthat  constituted the tax fraud  offenses and, therefore, the two\n\nproperly were joined under  Rule 8(b).  Similarly, the  tax fraud\n\nand  mail  fraud  counts could  be  joined  because  some of  the\n\nunreported income  was the fruit of  the mail fraud  scheme.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. 80, 86-87 (D.D.C. 1983),\n                          \n\naff'd, 760 F.2d 327 (D.C. Cir. 1985). \n     \n\n     The harder  question is whether the conspiracy  and the mail\n\nfraud  counts properly  were joined.   Although  Count 1  accused\n\ndefendants of  conspiring to commit mail  fraud, this engineering\n\nconspiracy   differed   from   the   equipment   scheme   charged\n\nsubstantively  in Counts 5-14.   To determine if  the two schemes\n\nsufficiently  were connected  to the  same series  of acts  to be\n\njoined, we  must consider whether there  is \"substantial identity\n\nof  facts  or  participants\"  underlying  the  charged  offenses.\n\nUnited States v. Levine, 546 F.2d 658, 662 (5th Cir. 1977).  Mere\n                       \n\nsimilarity of the  acts would not suffice.

United States, 355 F.2d 700, 703 (1st Cir. 1966).  \n                          \n\n     We conclude  that the indictment properly consolidated these\n\ncounts.  Both schemes used the same basic mechanism to overcharge\n\nfor services and  equipment.   As the district  court found,  the\n\nengineering conspiracy  and the  equipment fraud shared  the same\n\nparticipants and victims and  overlapped in time.   Both offenses\n\ndepended on  the interrelationships  among the GBPC,  Coogan, and\n\n                               -20-\n\nYefsky for their  operation.  A joint trial  of the offenses thus\n\navoided  problems  of  inconsistent verdicts  and  repetition  of\n\ntestimony.   See United  States v.

Accordingly, the  acts underlying the offenses were\n\nsufficiently related to warrant joinder.\n\n     A  finding of  proper  joinder does  not,  however, end  our\n\ninquiry.   If  a  defendant is  prejudiced  from the  joinder  of\n\ncounts, severance may  be appropriate, pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.\n\nP.  14.5   We, therefore,  must consider  whether the  benefit of\n\njoinder outweighed the risk of prejudice to the defendant.  King,\n                                                                \n\n355 F.2d at 704.\n\nB.

The decision  to grant  severance is\n\ncommitted to the  district court's sound  discretion.  Zafiro  v.\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States, 61 U.S.L.W.  4147, 4148-49 (U.S.  Jan. 26, 1993);\n              \n\nNatanel,  938 F.2d  at 308.   Severance  is appropriate  \"only if\n       \n\n                    \n\n     5  Rule 14 provides in relevant part:\n\n     If it  appears that a  defendant or  the government  is\n     prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in\n     an  indictment or  information or  by such  joinder for\n     trial  together, the  court  may order  an election  or\n     separate  trials  of  counts,   grant  a  severance  of\n     defendants  or  provide whatever  other  relief justice\n     requires.\n\n     6   We do  not address the question  of severing Counts 2-4.\nBecause  Coogan was the only defendant charged with tax fraud and\nhe  has not  appealed, these  offenses will  not be  re-tried and\ncannot affect Yefsky on a remand.\n\n                               -21-\n\nthere  is a serious  risk that a  joint trial would  compromise a\n\nspecific trial right  of one  of the defendants,  or prevent  the\n\njury  from making a reliable judgment  about guilt or innocence.\"\n\nZafiro, 61  U.S.L.W.  at 4148.  Incidental  spillover  prejudice,\n      \n\nwhich is almost inevitable in  a multi-defendant trial, does  not\n\nsuffice.   United States v.  Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94,  97 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991); United States  v. Martinez,  922 F.2d 914,  923 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991).    We will not  reverse a denial of  severance, therefore,\n\nunless  the defendant  makes \"`a  strong showing  of prejudice.'\"\n\nUnited States v.  Gray, 958 F.2d 9,  14 (1st Cir.  1992) (quoting\n                      \n\nUnited States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n                             \n\n     We look first at the severance of counts.  In his  pre-trial\n\nmotion  to  sever, Yefsky  suggested  only that  evidence  of the\n\namount of money garnered from the equipment fraud would overwhelm\n\nthe lack  of evidence  of his  participation  in the  engineering\n\nscheme.   The district court refused to sever the counts, finding\n\nthe  mere  allegation  of  potential  spillover  insufficient  to\n\nwarrant severance.  Memorandum and Order at 6.  \n\n     We agree with the district court.  It was Yefsky's burden to\n\narticulate  specific ways in which he was prejudiced.  Zafiro, 61\n                                                             \n\nU.S.L.W.  at 4149.    To make  the  requisite strong  showing  of\n\nprejudice,  a defendant must \"present enough information . . . to\n\nsatisfy  the  court  that  the claim  of  prejudice  is genuine.\"\n\nUnited States  v. Tracy,  No. 92-1459,  slip op.  at 9 (1st  Cir.\n                       \n\nMarch  29, 1993) (quoting Baker  v. United States,  401 F.2d 958,\n                                                 \n\n977 (D.C. Cir. 1968)).  Speculative allegations of prejudice fall\n\n                               -22-\n\nfar  short of  the  prejudice  required  to  prove  an  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion in denying a  motion for severance.  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nPorter,  764 F.2d  1,  13 (1st  Cir.  1985) (citations  omitted).\n      \n\nYefsky did not provide the district court with a factual basis to\n\ndetermine if his claim of prejudice was genuine.  On this record,\n\nthe court did not err in denying the motion to sever counts.7\n\n     Yefsky also contends that  he was prejudiced by  being tried\n\nwith  Coogan.  Specifically, Yefsky argues that the weight of the\n\nevidence  against  Coogan,  coupled  with the  lack  of  specific\n\ninstructions at  the close  of  trial limiting  that evidence  to\n\nCoogan, prevented him from presenting adequately his defense that\n\nhe was merely a pawn in Coogan's scheme.  \n\n     This argument first ignores the fact that Yefsky was charged\n\nwith Coogan in a conspiracy and in a  separate mail fraud scheme.\n\nEvidence  against Coogan  thus  was  admissible against  Yefsky.8\n\n                    \n\n     7  On appeal, Yefsky suggests for the first time that he was\nprejudiced by  the jury's inability to  differentiate between the\nengineering conspiracy and  the equipment scheme.   He bases  his\nargument on the fact that the four substantive counts of which he\nwas convicted involved projects for which he personally performed\nengineering work.  Because this argument was not presented to the\ndistrict court,  even though Yefsky raised the issue of severance\nagain  in his  post-judgment motion for  a new  trial, we  do not\nconsider  it on appeal.  Tracy, slip  op. at 9 n.2 (citing United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n                 \n\n     8   Toward the close of trial, the district court determined\nthat a  preponderance of the evidence  demonstrated the existence\nof  a conspiracy, each defendant's  membership in it  at the time\nthat certain declarations were  made, and that these declarations\nwere made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  It therefore allowed\nthe issue of conspiracy to  go to the jury.  See United States v.\n                                                              \nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23  (1st Cir. 1977).  The court  later\n            \ncharged  the jury  that it  could consider  each co-conspirator's\nacts and statements in determining a defendant's participation in\nthe conspiracy.  Yefsky did not challenge this instruction.\n\n                               -23-\n\nSabatino, 943 F.2d at 96; see Wormick, 709 F.2d at 461  (applying\n                                     \n\nconspiracy  doctrines to  multi-member  mail fraud  schemes).   A\n\nseparate trial, therefore, would not have availed Yefsky.\n\n     Second, the argument overlooks the fact that mere antagonism\n\nof defenses does not  require severance.  Zafiro, 61  U.S.L.W. at\n                                                \n\n4148;  Arruda, 715 F.2d at 679 (citations omitted).  Instead, the\n             \n\ntension between  defenses must be so great that a jury would have\n\nto believe  one defendant at the  expense of the other.   Arruda,\n                                                                \n\n715 F.2d  at 679.   Yefsky has not  met this standard.   Although\n\nYefsky proclaimed his innocence  by blaming Coogan, Coogan merely\n\ndenied  the occurrence  of  any fraud.    Yefsky cannot  credibly\n\ncomplain that  a jury believing Coogan's  defense therefore would\n\nfind Yefsky guilty.  \n\n     The  district  court, in  fact,  took  appropriate steps  to\n\nminimize  any  spillover  prejudice  Yefsky  might  suffer.    It\n\nroutinely  issued  instructions  limiting  the  evidence  to  the\n\nappropriate counts and defendants.  Juries are presumed to follow\n\nsuch  instructions.   Richardson  v.  Marsh,  481 U.S.  200,  211\n                                           \n\n(1987).    It   also  instructed  the   jury  to  give   separate\n\nconsideration to  an individual defendant's guilt  on each count.\n\nThese instructions were sufficient  to cure incidental  prejudice\n\nfrom evidentiary spillover.  See Zafiro, 61 U.S.L.W. at 4149.  \n                                       \n\n     Rule  14 leaves the  determination of the  risk of prejudice\n\nand any necessary remedy to the court's discretion.  The district\n\ncourt  weighed the risk to  Yefsky and acted  suitably to protect\n\nhim.   Because Yefsky has  not shown any  manifest prejudice, the\n\n                               -24-\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion\n\nto sever.\n\n                                V.\n\n     Yefsky  next  argues  that   the  district  court  erred  in\n\nexcluding defense evidence offered at  trial and that the  errors\n\nprevented  him from presenting his defense.  We review each piece\n\nof evidence in turn.\n\nA.  Maxine Yefsky\n                 \n\n     Maxine  Yefsky acted  as  bookkeeper for  her husband's  and\n\nson's firms.  She  testified that she had no  accounting training\n\nand had problems  filing correct Forms  1099 with  the IRS.   The\n\ndistrict court  barred her  from testifying about  a conversation\n\nshe  had had with Coogan in January  1981 about these forms.  Ms.\n\nYefsky would have testified that Coogan had told  her not to file\n\nthe forms for him  because his office would.   The court excluded\n\nCoogan's statement as hearsay.  \n\n     Yefsky contends  that the court erred  in excluding Coogan's\n\nstatement as hearsay.   Yefsky  urges that the  evidence was  not\n\nhearsay because he sought to introduce it only to demonstrate his\n\nwife's reliance on  the statement and  his own lack of  intent to\n\nhelp Coogan evade taxes.  See United States v. Hicks, 848 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n3 (1st Cir.  1988) (evidence  not offered  for its  truth is  not\n\nhearsay).   The government  agrees on  appeal that  the testimony\n\nwrongly was excluded.\n\n     We must consider, however,  whether the error harmed Yefsky.\n\nLubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc., 929 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                               \n\n                               -25-\n\nOur inquiry depends  on the centrality  of the evidence  excluded\n\nand  the  prejudicial  effect  of  the  exclusion.    Id.  at  46\n                                                         \n\n(citations omitted).   Yefsky argues  that the  error was  highly\n\nprejudicial because it effectively prevented him  from presenting\n\na defense to the tax  fraud conspiracy.  His defense was  that he\n\nhad no knowledge of  and no intent to assist  Coogan's wrongdoing\n\nbut was merely a pawn.  \n\n     Our review of  the record  convinces us that  the error  was\n\nharmless.    This evidence  was relevant  only  to the  tax fraud\n\nobjective of the conspiracy  count.  As we have  found sufficient\n\nevidence  of  Yefsky's  participation  in  the engineering  fraud\n\nobjective,  see Section II supra, the  erroneous exclusion of Ms.\n                                \n\nYefsky's testimony  did not  affect Yefsky's conviction  on Count\n\n1.9\n\nB.  Motorola\n            \n\n     Two  Motorola employees  called  by  Coogan testified  about\n\ntheir involvement with  the BAPERN project.  Both  testified that\n\nthey had  made sales proposals  to prospective customers  and had\n\nhad conversations  with their supervisors  regarding GBPC pricing\n\nprocedures and  policies.   One employee  also testified  that he\n\nknew  of equipment prices quoted by Coogan.  The court prohibited\n\nas  hearsay  testimony  about  the substance  of  the  witnesses'\n\n                    \n\n     9  Moreover, on cross-examination, Yefsky testified that his\nwife  had informed him of her conversation  with Coogan.  He also\ntestified that,  in not filing the  tax forms, she had  relied on\nCoogan's  assurance that he would.   His trial  counsel used this\ntestimony  in  closing  argument  to  support  Yefsky's  defense.\nYefsky himself thus cured  the error, and he cannot  complain now\nof prejudice.  \n\n                               -26-\n\nconversations with  their supervisors and their  customers, which\n\nwould  have revealed  Motorola's  awareness  of Coogan's  pricing\n\npractice. \n\n     At trial,  Yefsky attempted  to use  this testimony to  show\n\nthat  Motorola had offered BAPERN prices to non-GBPC members.  On\n\nappeal, Yefsky  argues instead that the  testimony was admissible\n\nto demonstrate his  lack of knowledge  that Coogan was  inflating\n\nprices.    The  government   again  concedes  that  the  disputed\n\ntestimony  would not be hearsay if offered for the purpose Yefsky\n\nnow advances.  But because Yefsky raises this issue for the first\n\ntime on appeal, we review the exclusion  for plain error.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Young, 470 U.S. 1,  15 (1985).  Yefsky can prevail only\n               \n\nif  the error was so egregious that  he suffered a miscarriage of\n\njustice.  Id.\n             \n\n     Yefsky does  not meet this standard.  Although the employees\n\ndid not testify  about the actual  price discrepancies, they  did\n\nstate that they did  not discuss the discrepancies with  the GBPC\n\nchairman.   Yefsky thus was able to argue that Motorola tolerated\n\nthe  inflated  prices.    Yefsky  also  called  a  third Motorola\n\nemployee who testified that  Yefsky had consulted Motorola before\n\nmaking  three  price  proposals  and that  those  prices  matched\n\nMotorola's.    Yefsky thus  could argue  that  he did  not assist\n\nCoogan to inflate  equipment prices,  or at least  acted in  good\n\nfaith when he quoted prices, and that Motorola did not inform him\n\nof Coogan's overcharging.   Under these circumstances, Yefsky had\n\n                               -27-\n\nadequate  fuel  for  his defense  and  did  not  suffer from  the\n\nexclusion of the testimony in question.\n\n     Yefsky  also  claims  that  the district  court  erroneously\n\nexcluded  the depositions of two  police chiefs, which also would\n\nhave  shown Motorola's  knowledge  of Coogan's  pricing practice.\n\nDeposition  testimony  is  admissible,  however,  only  when  the\n\nwitness  is unavailable.   Fed. R.  Evid. 804(b)(1).   One of the\n\nwitnesses actually testified at trial for the government and, so,\n\nclearly was available.   Yefsky has offered no evidence  that the\n\nother witness was unavailable.  No error, therefore, occurred.\n\nC.  Harvard Radio Tower Project\n                               \n\n     A Harvard  official testified  about Harvard's entry  to the\n\nBAPERN  system.  Yefsky then tried to  elicit evidence of work he\n\nsubsequently performed on the Harvard radio tower.   The district\n\ncourt excluded  the evidence as  irrelevant.  Yefsky  argues that\n\nthe testimony was  admissible as evidence of his good  faith as a\n\ngeneral business practice.\n\n     A  district  court  enjoys  broad  discretion regarding  the\n\nadmissibility  of  evidence  on  relevancy grounds.    Conway  v.\n                                                             \n\nElectro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir. 1987).  We will\n                    \n\nreverse  a court's decision only upon a showing of manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.  Id. (citations omitted).\n                   \n\n     Yefsky does  not  make such  a  showing.   At  trial and  on\n\nappeal,  Yefsky concedes that his work on the Harvard radio tower\n\nproject  was not connected  to any GBPC or  BAPERN contract.  Nor\n\nwas it temporally  related to  BAPERN, for the  project came  two\n\n                               -28-\n\nyears  after  he completed  work  on Harvard's  entry  to BAPERN.\n\nAccordingly, the district  court did not abuse  its discretion in\n\nrefusing to admit testimony so tenuously connected to  the issues\n\nat hand.10\n\n                               VI.\n\n     Finally, we turn briefly to the issues remaining in Yefsky's\n\nappeal.\n\nA.  Double Jeopardy\n                   \n\n     Yefsky  also  raises the  severance  of  counts issue  as  a\n\nproblem  of  double jeopardy.   He  claims  that evidence  of the\n\nengineering conspiracy  impermissibly was used to  convict him of\n\nthe equipment mail  fraud and  therefore caused him  to be  tried\n\ntwice for the   engineering conspiracy.  This claim  is mistaken.\n\nYefsky properly could be charged  with conspiracy to commit  mail\n\nfraud and  with the underlying  substantive mail fraud.   Boylan,\n                                                                \n\n898  F.2d at  245.   Such an  indictment would  not have  exposed\n\nYefsky to double  jeopardy because the government would  have had\n\nto prove different facts for  each charge.  See Serino,  835 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 930.  In an indictment for both conspiracy and mail fraud, the\n\nfirst requires proof of an agreement and an intent to involve the\n\nmails,  and the second requires  proof that the  mails were used.\n\nDray, 901 F.2d at 1137; United States v. Camiel, 689  F.2d 31, 36\n                                               \n\n(3d Cir. 1982).  The  problem Yefsky raises is that the  jury may\n\n                    \n\n     10   In any  event, we  note that  the court  allowed Yefsky\nample  time to delve into  his work on  specific BAPERN projects.\nHe thus was able to use BAPERN  work to prove his defense of good\nfaith.\n\n                               -29-\n\nhave been unable to compartmentalize the evidence properly.   See\n                                                                 \n\nSection IV supra.\n                \n\nB.  Jury Charge\n               \n\n     Yefsky also contends  that the district  court erred in  not\n\ncharging the  jury  that specific  intent  to commit  the  object\n\noffenses was an essential  element of the conspiracy.   The court\n\ninstructed  the  jury  that  \"[w]hat  is necessary  is  that  the\n\ndefendant must have knowingly  and willfully participated in some\n\nway in the unlawful plan with the intent to further  the unlawful\n\npurpose of the  conspiracy.\"  Tr. Vol.  82 at 20.  We  review the\n\njury  charge as a whole to determine whether this instruction was\n\nerroneous.  Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973).  \n                            \n\n     Although the insertion of  \"specific\" before \"intent\" may be\n\npreferable,  we find  the jury  charge sufficient.   We  upheld a\n\nsimilar instruction in United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 16-17\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1985),  which stated, \"you would have to  find that the\n\nperson  knew that  a conspiracy  existed and  voluntarily entered\n\ninto it  with the intent of  achieving the illegal  object of the\n\nagreement\".  Here,  the court defined  the terms \"knowingly\"  and\n\n\"willfully\" for the jury  before giving the disputed instruction.\n\nIn particular,  it defined  \"willfully\" to mean  \"voluntarily and\n\npurposefully with  the specific  intent to  do something the  law\n\nforbids.\"   Tr. Vol. 82 at 15.  The court thus clearly instructed\n\nthe jury that it  had to find that  Yefsky joined the  conspiracy\n\nwith the specific  intent to accomplish  the unlawful purpose  of\n\nthe   conspiracy,  namely  tax  and  mail  fraud.    Because  the\n\n                               -30-\n\ninstruction  adequately covered  specific intent,  Yefsky is  not\n\nentitled to any relief.   United States v.

Sheldon Yefsky was convicted\n                                 \n\nby a jury of  a dual-object conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n   371 and  1341, and of four counts of  mail fraud, unrelated to\n\nthe conspiracy,  in violation of  18 U.S.C.    1341.  On  appeal,\n\nYefsky raises a number of challenges to his conviction.  After an\n\nexhaustive review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n     We   begin  with  a  brief  description  of  the  facts  and\n\nproceedings.\n\n     The Greater  Boston Police Council (GBPC) was  formed in the\n\nearly 1960s as a mutual aid society for various metropolitan area\n\nlaw enforcement  agencies.    The  GBPC enabled  its  members  to\n\npurchase equipment  at  reduced  prices  pursuant  to  collective\n\npurchase agreements.  As  an unincorporated association, the GBPC\n\nrelied on one of its members to act as its fiduciary agent.  \n\n     At  all times  relevant to  this case,  the Town  of Newton,\n\nwhose police chief William Quinn served as the chair of the GBPC,\n\nfulfilled that role.   Quinn, in turn, relied heavily  on Timothy\n\nCoogan, a civilian employee of the police department, to  conduct\n\nthe  daily operations  of the  GBPC.   Coogan became  a full-time\n\nemployee  after   graduating  from  law  school   and  ended  his\n\naffiliation with Newton in mid-1985, when the offenses underlying\n\nthis case surfaced.\n\n     A  primary  concern of  the GBPC  was  the inability  of the\n\nmember  police  departments to  communicate  with  each other  by\n\nradio.   To solve this  problem, the GBPC  undertook a project to\n\ndevelop  an integrated radio system for its members.  This system\n\nbecame known  as the Boston  Area Police Emergency  Radio Network\n\n(BAPERN).  \n\n     In  1975, the GBPC hired  a Chicago-based firm, Computer and\n\nEngineering  Services (CES),  of  which Yefsky  is president,  to\n\nassess  the  existing radio  systems.   One  year later,  CES was\n\nawarded a bid contract of $31,000 to design and implement BAPERN.\n\nThe  system used  Motorola equipment,  which  was available  at a\n\ndiscount through a GBPC collective purchase contract.  \n\n     By June  1978, BAPERN  was fully operational,  connecting 23\n\ncities  and  towns, and  Coogan  had  became the  BAPERN  project\n\ndirector  and general counsel and administrator for the GBPC.  In\n\nthese capacities, Coogan  exercised financial and  administrative\n\ncontrol  of  GBPC  affairs,  including the  BAPERN  project.   He\n\nencouraged organizations  to join  BAPERN and recommended  CES to\n\nthem  for  engineering and  design work.   Coogan  alone received\n\nshipping  orders  from  BAPERN  members  to  the  GBPC,  prepared\n\nGBPC/Newton  shipping  orders  to  CES  and   Motorola,  approved\n\ninvoices from  these businesses  to the GBPC/Newton  for payment,\n\nprepared bills  from the GBPC/Newton  to the BAPERN  members, and\n\nreceived  the  members'  payments.   Newton  officials, including\n\nQuinn,  merely  rubber stamped  his work.    Coogan was,  in many\n\nrespects, the person most identified with the GBPC. \n\n     In  1985,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  began  an\n\ninvestigation of  Coogan, which revealed large  amounts of income\n\nthat he  had not  reported to  the  IRS.   The unreported  income\n\n                               -3-\n\nstemmed  from two  sources.   First,  Coogan  had become  a  paid\n\nconsultant  to  International  Telecommunications  Service,  Inc.\n\n(ITS),  a subsidiary of CES, to perform engineering field work on\n\nthe  BAPERN system.  Second,  Coogan had overcharged GBPC members\n\nfor radio equipment and  had diverted the overcharge to  a secret\n\nbank account for his personal use.\n\n     In  1989,  Coogan,  Yefsky,  his  son  Michael  Yefsky,  the\n\npresident of ITS,  and Samuel Diamond, the financial  officer and\n\ntax preparer for CES and ITS, were charged with numerous criminal\n\nviolations stemming from their involvement in the BAPERN project.\n\nThe indictment charged  the existence of two  separate schemes to\n\ndefraud members of  the GBPC  and charged Coogan  alone with  tax\n\nfraud  for  concealing  his  illicit profits  from  both  schemes\n\n(Counts 2-4).  \n\n     The first scheme charged was a conspiracy involving all four\n\ndefendants (Count  1).  The goals  of the conspiracy were  to pay\n\nCoogan  kickbacks for sending engineering work to CES and to help\n\nhim hide  that income  from  the IRS.    The kickbacks  were  the\n\npayments ITS made  to Coogan, allegedly  for his field  services.\n\nAt  trial,  the  government  explained that  the  kickbacks  were\n\nfinanced by  charging GBPC members for  engineering services that\n\nwere  unnecessary or  never were performed or by overcharging for\n\nwork actually done.\n\n     The second intrigue implicated  Coogan and Yefsky in a  mail\n\nfraud scheme based on  the equipment overcharge and  diversion of\n\nfunds  for Coogan's personal  use (Counts 5-14).   The government\n\n                               -4-\n\nconsistently has admitted  that this was  a scheme distinct  from\n\nthe  engineering conspiracy.   The  mailing of  ten payments  for\n\nequipment, maintenance fees, and  BAPERN expansion fees by member\n\norganizations comprised the individual mail fraud counts.\n\n     A  tedious and  rambling  trial stretching  86 days  ensued.\n\nOver 1000 exhibits were  admitted, with more than half  subjected\n\nto  limitations as  to the  various counts  and defendants.   The\n\ngovernment alone consumed 44 days and 878 exhibits to present its\n\ncase-in-chief.  Yefsky used  another 24 days and 376  exhibits to\n\npresent  his defense.  The thrust of  his defense was that he did\n\nnot join in either the conspiracy or the equipment scheme but was\n\na pawn of Coogan.\n\n     At the trial's  conclusion, the jury convicted Coogan of all\n\n14 counts against  him.   It convicted Yefsky  of the  conspiracy\n\ncount  and 4  of the  10 mail  fraud counts.   It  also convicted\n\nMichael  Yefsky  and Diamond  of the  conspiracy count,  the only\n\ncharge against them.  \n\n     During the proceedings below,  Yefsky made many motions, the\n\ndecisions of which form the bases  of this appeal.  These motions\n\ninclude  a motion  for acquittal  based on  insufficiency of  the\n\nevidence; a  motion to  dismiss the indictment  for insufficiency\n\nand  double  jeopardy; a  motion  for severance;  and  an omnibus\n\nmotion for a new  trial that reiterated  many of these issues  as\n\nwell as errors at trial.\n\n     Yefsky, his  son,  and Diamond  appealed their  convictions.\n\nThe government  then conceded  the insufficiency of  the evidence\n\n                               -5-\n\nsupporting the convictions of Michael Yefsky and Diamond, and the\n\nverdicts  against them  were  set aside  and  dismissed.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Yefsky, Memorandum and Order, Nos. 90-1222,  -1240 (1st\n                \n\nCir.  Jan.  29, 1993).   Coogan  did  not appeal  his conviction.\n\nYefsky's appeal remains, and we turn now to the issues he raises.\n\n                               II.\n\n     Yefsky contends that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion, renewed  at  close  of  trial,  for  acquittal  based  on\n\ninsufficiency  of   evidence.    When  reviewing   a  motion  for\n\nacquittal, we  consider the evidence in the  light most favorable\n\nto the prosecution.  United States v.

We turn  now to the facts\n\nthat the jury reasonably could find in support of the verdict. \n\n     In  1979,  the relationships  among  the  GBPC, Coogan,  and\n\nYefsky  changed, allowing  the conspiracy  to germinate.   First,\n\nCoogan  was forced  to leave  regular employment with  the Newton\n\nPolice  Department  because  he  was maintaining  a  private  law\n\npractice.   He became instead a consultant to the Department and,\n\nin 1980, to  the GBPC.   His duties, however, remained  the same:\n\nassistant   to  Quinn   (as   police  chief   and  GBPC   chair),\n\nadministrator of  and general  counsel to  the GBPC,  and project\n\ndirector  of BAPERN.  In addition, his contracts permitted him to\n\nengage in other telecommunications consulting work.\n\n     Second,  government funding  and  oversight  of  the  BAPERN\n\nproject  ended.   Coogan then  prepared an  open-ended consulting\n\ncontract  for CES that defined  its role during  the expansion of\n\nBAPERN.  The new  contract called for CES to  provide engineering\n\nservices as requested by shipping orders issued through Newton on\n\nbehalf of the GBPC members.\n\n     The CES  contract did not  permit CES to  use subcontractors\n\nwithout written  consent from  Newton.  Nonetheless,  in December\n\n1979, CES entered a contract with ITS  by which ITS would perform\n\nfield  implementation  studies  and   services  for  various  CES\n\nprojects, including  BAPERN, and CES would pay ITS's salaries and\n\noverhead expenses.  \n\n                               -7-\n\n     At some point during  this period, Coogan approached Yefsky,\n\nproposing  to become  CES's local  \"clerk of  the works\"  for the\n\nBAPERN project.  In December 1979, Coogan entered a contract with\n\nITS to provide field  engineering; site, installation and testing\n\nsupervision;  and  training for  the  BAPERN  expansion.   Unlike\n\nYefsky's other  subcontractors, Coogan was paid a fixed price for\n\neach project  on which he worked  and was not  required to submit\n\ntime  sheets to corroborate his  fee.  Neither  Yefsky nor Coogan\n\never  revealed their  subcontracting  relationship  to the  GBPC.\n\nCoogan, in fact, repeatedly denied to Chief Quinn engaging in any\n\noutside telecommunications consulting work.  \n\n     From 1980  to mid-1985, 25  to 30  organizations joined  the\n\nBAPERN  system.   Coogan  recommended CES  to  many of  them  for\n\nengineering work.  As a result, CES's  income skyrocketed; during\n\nthis  period,  the  firm   received  approximately  $964,000  for\n\nengineering services relating to  BAPERN.  More than half  of the\n\npayments were for field work billed by Coogan.   Coogan, in turn,\n\nreceived approximately $484,760  from ITS for his  services.  CES\n\nreimbursed  ITS for  this and other  expenses, pursuant  to their\n\nsubcontract.\n\n     Many  of  the  payments  for engineering  were  inflated  or\n\nunnecessary.  Yefsky  himself testified that he had not performed\n\nwork  for  some  of the  police  departments  that  had paid  for\n\nengineering  services.   Some departments  also paid more  to the\n\nGBPC than CES had billed  GBPC.  Payments routinely were sent  to\n\nthe GBPC by mail.\n\n                               -8-\n\n     Coogan did  not report his ITS  income to the IRS.   Nor did\n\nITS  file Forms 1099 with the IRS  to reflect payments to Coogan.\n\nITS  did, however, list the consulting  fees as business expenses\n\non  its corporate tax returns.   CES also  listed its payments to\n\nITS as business expenses.1\n\n     From these facts, the jury reasonably could draw a series of\n\ninferences  to  connect Yefsky  to the  mail  fraud prong  of the\n\nconspiracy.   The jury could find that, once government oversight\n\nended, Coogan and Yefsky grasped an opportunity to make money out\n\nof the BAPERN project.  Thus,  it could find that Coogan  drafted\n\nthe open-ended CES contract  so that CES could pay  him kickbacks\n\nto steer  work orders to  CES.  It  also could find that  CES and\n\nCoogan  financed  the kickbacks  by  charging  inflated fees  for\n\nengineering work actually performed  or completely false fees for\n\nwork never  performed.   Accordingly, the  jury  could find  that\n\nYefsky and Coogan agreed  to enrich themselves by  defrauding the\n\nmembers of BAPERN.\n\n     Because we find the  evidence sufficient to support Yefsky's\n\nconviction of  conspiring to  commit  mail fraud,  we uphold  his\n\nconviction on Count 1 without  considering the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence  supporting the tax fraud object.  See Griffin v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 112 S.

But they were never indicted for tax fraud in connection\nwith the  kickback  scheme.    Although the  two  companies  were\naudited  by the  IRS, they  were not  required to  pay additional\ntaxes for the years in question.\n\n                               -9-\n\nobject  of  dual-object  conspiracy held  sufficient  to  support\n\nconspiracy conviction).  \n\nB.  The Mail Fraud Counts\n                         \n\n     The indictment charged  Yefsky and Coogan with ten counts of\n\nmail fraud  in connection  with the equipment  overcharge scheme.\n\nEach mailing  represented a  payment from  a  BAPERN member  that\n\nCoogan diverted to his secret bank account.  Yefsky was convicted\n\nof four of the ten counts.  \n\n     A conviction for mail fraud2  requires proof of two elements\n\nbeyond   a  reasonable   doubt.     They   are  the   defendant's\n\nparticipation in a  scheme to defraud and  the use of the  mails,\n\neither  by or  caused by  the defendants,  in furtherance  of the\n\nscheme.  United States v.

The\n                        \n\nmailing  of proceeds  of  a fraudulent  scheme  is sufficient  to\n\nuphold  a conviction  for mail fraud.   Silvano, 812  F.2d at 760\n                                               \n\n(citations omitted).  \n\n     Yefsky challenges the sufficiency of evidence linking him to\n\nthe scheme to defraud and to the mailings.  Because each count of\n\nwhich  he  was convicted  undisputedly  represents  a mailing  of\n\nproceeds of the scheme, Yefsky's convictions must be  affirmed if\n\nthe evidence  sufficiently  supports  his  participation  in  the\n\nscheme to overbill  for equipment.   We turn,  therefore, to  the\n\nevidence of Yefsky's participation in the equipment scheme.\n\n     In 1982, the  GBPC negotiated a  new contract with  Motorola\n\nfor the purchase  of equipment.   Yefsky assisted  Coogan in  the\n\nnegotiations,  which  resulted  in  deeper  discounts for  BAPERN\n\nmembers.    Coogan then  began  to bill  BAPERN  members inflated\n\nprices  for Motorola  equipment.   He also  provided false  price\n\nlists, representing  them as part  of the  Motorola contract,  to\n\ncorroborate the prices he charged.  A Motorola employee testified\n\nat trial that a comparison of Motorola bills with GBPC bills  for\n\nequipment revealed that Coogan  had overcharged BAPERN members by\n\nat least $888,000.\n\n                               -11-\n\n     Coogan deposited  the overcharge into a  bank account opened\n\nunder GBPC's name but without its knowledge or authorization.  He\n\nwas the  only  person  authorized  to withdraw  funds  from  this\n\naccount.   By December 1984, over $1.5 million had been deposited\n\ninto the account.   Coogan diverted this money for  personal use,\n\nsuch as purchasing certificates  of deposit and paying mortgages.\n\nThe  government  conceded at  oral  argument that  Yefsky  had no\n\nknowledge of this account and did  not share in the proceeds from\n\nthe overcharge.\n\n     Yefsky,  however,  was  present  at meetings  when  inflated\n\nprices  were quoted and discussed.  He also recommended the kinds\n\nof equipment to be purchased to organizations joining  BAPERN and\n\nincluded   inflated  price   lists,  obtained  from   Coogan,  in\n\nfeasibility studies he conducted for two organizations.\n\n     The facts  connecting Yefsky to the equipment scheme are not\n\nas  numerous   as  those   connecting  him  to   the  engineering\n\nconspiracy.   Nonetheless,  the jury  could conclude  that Yefsky\n\nknew that the equipment prices were being inflated because he had\n\nhelped to  negotiate the purchase agreement  that established the\n\nlegitimate prices.  It could conclude that Yefsky then joined the\n\nequipment scheme  by supporting and using  Coogan's quotations of\n\ninflated  prices.  It also could conclude that Yefsky entered the\n\nscheme   to  ensure   Coogan's  ongoing   participation  in   the\n\nengineering  conspiracy.     These  inferences   and  the   facts\n\nsupporting them are sufficient to sustain Yefsky's convictions of\n\nmail fraud.\n\n                               -12-\n\n                               III.\n\n     Yefsky  next  challenges  the adequacy  of  the  indictment,\n\nclaiming that the engineering fraud prong of the conspiracy count\n\nwas  defective because  it did  not specify  the  false pretenses\n\nused.3  He contends that this  defect deprived him of the ability\n\nto  present a meaningful defense.  The district court agreed that\n\nthe  count  did  not  specify  the false  pretenses  alleged  but\n\ndetermined  that the  indictment as  a whole  sufficiently warned\n\nYefsky  of  the  charges  against him.    Memorandum  and  Order,\n\nDecember 20,  1988, at  2.  It  therefore refused to  dismiss the\n\nengineering fraud count.   We disagree with  the district court's\n\ndecision but find its error harmless.\n\n     Rule  7(c)(1) of  the  Federal Rules  of Criminal  Procedure\n\nrequires an indictment to provide \"a plain,  concise and definite\n\nwritten statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\n\ncharged.\"  The Supreme Court has instructed that an indictment is\n\nsufficient  if it contains  the elements of  the offense charged,\n\nfairly informs the defendant of the charges against which he must\n\ndefend, and  enables him to enter  a plea without fear  of double\n\njeopardy.

It urges  that  the challenged\n\ncount's  imprecision   regarding  the  mail  fraud  objective  is\n\nirrelevant.   Because the count  clearly charged an  agreement to\n                                                              \n\ndefraud  by use of the  mails, the government  argues that Yefsky\n\nwas able to prepare a defense to the conspiracy charge.\n\n     We disagree.  \"`Where guilt depends so crucially upon such a\n                                                                 \n\nspecific identification  of fact,  our cases have  uniformly held\n                                \n\nthat an indictment must  do more than simply repeat  the language\n\nof the criminal  statute.'\"   Hamling, 418 U.S.  at 118  (quoting\n                                     \n\nRussell  v.

A  multi-member  mail fraud  is  itself treated  like  a\n\nconspiracy.

Thus, the  engineering\n\nconspiracy  count essentially  charged  Yefsky  with agreeing  to\n\ncommit  another conspiracy.4   Yefsky  could not  be expected  to\n\ndefend himself from a  charge of conspiring to join  a conspiracy\n\nto  perpetrate a  fraud if  the indictment  did not  identify the\n\nfraud that was the ultimate underlying offense.  \n\n     It is  undisputed that the engineering  conspiracy count did\n\nnot identify  the  plan used  to  defraud the  GBPC.   The  count\n\nalleged  only that Coogan had  used his control  over the GBPC to\n\narrange  CES's  open-ended  engineering contract  in  1979,  that\n\nCoogan  had signed a contract with ITS to provide field services,\n\nthat CES received approximately  $964,000 under its new contract,\n\nand that ITS paid Coogan $484,760.  None of these allegations, on\n\ntheir face, describe  fraudulent conduct.  The  count then stated\n\nin conclusory  language drawn from  the mail  fraud statute  that\n\nCoogan  had obtained  this money  from the  GBPC  members through\n\nfalse pretenses.  It  did not divulge  the factual basis of  this\n\n                    \n\n     4   Yefsky,  of course,  could have  been charged  with both\nconspiracy  to   commit  the  engineering  fraud   and  with  the\nsubstantive  mail fraud  without  risking double  jeopardy.   See\n                                                                 \ninfra Section VI.\n     \n\n                               -15-\n\naccusation.

The engineering conspiracy  involved one scheme  to pay\n\nkickbacks to Coogan and to help  him evade tax liability; the tax\n\nfraud encompassed Coogan alone;  and the substantive fraud scheme\n\nentailed  a  distinct plot  to  inflate  equipment prices,  which\n\novercharge Coogan  alone pocketed.  The  conspiracy also predated\n\nthe equipment  overcharge scheme by  three years.   Yefsky argues\n\nthat the only common thread in  these charges is Coogan and  that\n\nthis single strand is too weak to bind the three offenses.  \n\n     There can be  no doubt  that the tax  fraud counts  properly\n\nwere  joined with either the conspiracy or the mail fraud counts.\n\nAs the district court noted, it is axiomatic that a defendant can\n\nbe  charged with both the conspiracy and the substantive offenses\n\n                               -19-\n\narising from it.

On this record,\n\nthe court did not err in denying the motion to sever counts.7\n\n     Yefsky also contends that  he was prejudiced by  being tried\n\nwith  Coogan.  Specifically, Yefsky argues that the weight of the\n\nevidence  against  Coogan,  coupled  with the  lack  of  specific\n\ninstructions at  the close  of  trial limiting  that evidence  to\n\nCoogan, prevented him from presenting adequately his defense that\n\nhe was merely a pawn in Coogan's scheme.  \n\n     This argument first ignores the fact that Yefsky was charged\n\nwith Coogan in a conspiracy and in a  separate mail fraud scheme.\n\nEvidence  against Coogan  thus  was  admissible against  Yefsky.8\n\n                    \n\n     7  On appeal, Yefsky suggests for the first time that he was\nprejudiced by  the jury's inability to  differentiate between the\nengineering conspiracy and  the equipment scheme.   He bases  his\nargument on the fact that the four substantive counts of which he\nwas convicted involved projects for which he personally performed\nengineering work.  Because this argument was not presented to the\ndistrict court,  even though Yefsky raised the issue of severance\nagain  in his  post-judgment motion for  a new  trial, we  do not\nconsider  it on appeal.

It therefore allowed\nthe issue of conspiracy to  go to the jury.  See United States v.\n                                                              \nPetrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23  (1st Cir. 1977).  The court  later\n            \ncharged  the jury  that it  could consider  each co-conspirator's\nacts and statements in determining a defendant's participation in\nthe conspiracy.  Yefsky did not challenge this instruction.\n\n                               -23-\n\nSabatino, 943 F.2d at 96; see Wormick, 709 F.2d at 461  (applying\n                                     \n\nconspiracy  doctrines to  multi-member  mail fraud  schemes).   A\n\nseparate trial, therefore, would not have availed Yefsky.\n\n     Second, the argument overlooks the fact that mere antagonism\n\nof defenses does not  require severance.  Zafiro, 61  U.S.L.W. at\n                                                \n\n4148;  Arruda, 715 F.2d at 679 (citations omitted).  Instead, the\n             \n\ntension between  defenses must be so great that a jury would have\n\nto believe  one defendant at the  expense of the other.   Arruda,\n                                                                \n\n715 F.2d  at 679.   Yefsky has not  met this standard.   Although\n\nYefsky proclaimed his innocence  by blaming Coogan, Coogan merely\n\ndenied  the occurrence  of  any fraud.    Yefsky cannot  credibly\n\ncomplain that  a jury believing Coogan's  defense therefore would\n\nfind Yefsky guilty.  \n\n     The  district  court, in  fact,  took  appropriate steps  to\n\nminimize  any  spillover  prejudice  Yefsky  might  suffer.    It\n\nroutinely  issued  instructions  limiting  the  evidence  to  the\n\nappropriate counts and defendants.  Juries are presumed to follow\n\nsuch  instructions.   Richardson  v.

See Zafiro, 61 U.S.L.W. at 4149.  \n                                       \n\n     Rule  14 leaves the  determination of the  risk of prejudice\n\nand any necessary remedy to the court's discretion.  The district\n\ncourt  weighed the risk to  Yefsky and acted  suitably to protect\n\nhim.   Because Yefsky has  not shown any  manifest prejudice, the\n\n                               -24-\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion\n\nto sever.\n\n                                V.\n\n     Yefsky  next  argues  that   the  district  court  erred  in\n\nexcluding defense evidence offered at  trial and that the  errors\n\nprevented  him from presenting his defense.

His defense was  that he\n\nhad no knowledge of  and no intent to assist  Coogan's wrongdoing\n\nbut was merely a pawn.  \n\n     Our review of  the record  convinces us that  the error  was\n\nharmless.    This evidence  was relevant  only  to the  tax fraud\n\nobjective of the conspiracy  count.  As we have  found sufficient\n\nevidence  of  Yefsky's  participation  in  the engineering  fraud\n\nobjective,  see Section II supra, the  erroneous exclusion of Ms.\n                                \n\nYefsky's testimony  did not  affect Yefsky's conviction  on Count\n\n1.9\n\nB.  Motorola\n            \n\n     Two  Motorola employees  called  by  Coogan testified  about\n\ntheir involvement with  the BAPERN project.  Both  testified that\n\nthey had  made sales proposals  to prospective customers  and had\n\nhad conversations  with their supervisors  regarding GBPC pricing\n\nprocedures and  policies.   One employee  also testified  that he\n\nknew  of equipment prices quoted by Coogan.  The court prohibited\n\nas  hearsay  testimony  about  the substance  of  the  witnesses'\n\n                    \n\n     9  Moreover, on cross-examination, Yefsky testified that his\nwife  had informed him of her conversation  with Coogan.  He also\ntestified that,  in not filing the  tax forms, she had  relied on\nCoogan's  assurance that he would.   His trial  counsel used this\ntestimony  in  closing  argument  to  support  Yefsky's  defense.\nYefsky himself thus cured  the error, and he cannot  complain now\nof prejudice.  \n\n                               -26-\n\nconversations with  their supervisors and their  customers, which\n\nwould  have revealed  Motorola's  awareness  of Coogan's  pricing\n\npractice. \n\n     At trial,  Yefsky attempted  to use  this testimony to  show\n\nthat  Motorola had offered BAPERN prices to non-GBPC members.  On\n\nappeal, Yefsky  argues instead that the  testimony was admissible\n\nto demonstrate his  lack of knowledge  that Coogan was  inflating\n\nprices.    The  government   again  concedes  that  the  disputed\n\ntestimony  would not be hearsay if offered for the purpose Yefsky\n\nnow advances.  But because Yefsky raises this issue for the first\n\ntime on appeal, we review the exclusion  for plain error.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  15 (1985).  Yefsky can prevail only\n               \n\nif  the error was so egregious that  he suffered a miscarriage of\n\njustice.  Id.\n             \n\n     Yefsky does  not meet this standard.  Although the employees\n\ndid not testify  about the actual  price discrepancies, they  did\n\nstate that they did  not discuss the discrepancies with  the GBPC\n\nchairman.   Yefsky thus was able to argue that Motorola tolerated\n\nthe  inflated  prices.    Yefsky  also  called  a  third Motorola\n\nemployee who testified that  Yefsky had consulted Motorola before\n\nmaking  three  price  proposals  and that  those  prices  matched\n\nMotorola's.    Yefsky thus  could argue  that  he did  not assist\n\nCoogan to inflate  equipment prices,  or at least  acted in  good\n\nfaith when he quoted prices, and that Motorola did not inform him\n\nof Coogan's overcharging.   Under these circumstances, Yefsky had\n\n                               -27-\n\nadequate  fuel  for  his defense  and  did  not  suffer from  the\n\nexclusion of the testimony in question.\n\n     Yefsky  also  claims  that  the district  court  erroneously\n\nexcluded  the depositions of two  police chiefs, which also would\n\nhave  shown Motorola's  knowledge  of Coogan's  pricing practice.\n\nDeposition  testimony  is  admissible,  however,  only  when  the\n\nwitness  is unavailable.   Fed. R.  Evid. 804(b)(1).   One of the\n\nwitnesses actually testified at trial for the government and, so,\n\nclearly was available.   Yefsky has offered no evidence  that the\n\nother witness was unavailable.  No error, therefore, occurred.\n\nC.  Harvard Radio Tower Project\n                               \n\n     A Harvard  official testified  about Harvard's entry  to the\n\nBAPERN  system.  Yefsky then tried to  elicit evidence of work he\n\nsubsequently performed on the Harvard radio tower.   The district\n\ncourt excluded  the evidence as  irrelevant.  Yefsky  argues that\n\nthe testimony was  admissible as evidence of his good  faith as a\n\ngeneral business practice.\n\n     A  district  court  enjoys  broad  discretion regarding  the\n\nadmissibility  of  evidence  on  relevancy grounds.    Conway  v.\n                                                             \n\nElectro Switch Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492354\"><a href=\"/opinion/492354/sandra-conway-v-electro-switch-corp-sandra-conway-v-electro-switch/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597 (1st Cir. 1987).  We will\n                    \n\nreverse  a court's decision only upon a showing of manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.  Id. (citations omitted).\n                   \n\n     Yefsky does  not  make such  a  showing.   At  trial and  on\n\nappeal,  Yefsky concedes that his work on the Harvard radio tower\n\nproject  was not connected  to any GBPC or  BAPERN contract.  Nor\n\nwas it temporally  related to  BAPERN, for the  project came  two\n\n                               -28-\n\nyears  after  he completed  work  on Harvard's  entry  to BAPERN.\n\nAccordingly, the district  court did not abuse  its discretion in\n\nrefusing to admit testimony so tenuously connected to  the issues\n\nat hand.10\n\n                               VI.\n\n     Finally, we turn briefly to the issues remaining in Yefsky's\n\nappeal.\n\nA.  Double Jeopardy\n                   \n\n     Yefsky  also  raises the  severance  of  counts issue  as  a\n\nproblem  of  double jeopardy.   He  claims  that evidence  of the\n\nengineering conspiracy  impermissibly was used to  convict him of\n\nthe equipment mail  fraud and  therefore caused him  to be  tried\n\ntwice for the   engineering conspiracy.  This claim  is mistaken.\n\nYefsky properly could be charged  with conspiracy to commit  mail\n\nfraud and  with the underlying  substantive mail fraud.   Boylan,\n                                                                \n\n898  F.2d at  245.   Such an  indictment would  not have  exposed\n\nYefsky to double  jeopardy because the government would  have had\n\nto prove different facts for  each charge.  See Serino,  835 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 930.  In an indictment for both conspiracy and mail fraud, the\n\nfirst requires proof of an agreement and an intent to involve the\n\nmails,  and the second requires  proof that the  mails were used.\n\nDray, 901 F.2d at 1137; United States v. Camiel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409110\"><a href=\"/opinion/409110/united-states-of-america-in-no-81-2933-v-camiel-peter-j-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36\n                                               \n\n(3d Cir. 1982).  The  problem Yefsky raises is that the  jury may\n\n                    \n\n     10   In any  event, we  note that  the court  allowed Yefsky\nample  time to delve into  his work on  specific BAPERN projects.\nHe thus was able to use BAPERN  work to prove his defense of good\nfaith.\n\n                               -29-\n\nhave been unable to compartmentalize the evidence properly.

Jury Charge\n               \n\n     Yefsky also contends  that the district  court erred in  not\n\ncharging the  jury  that specific  intent  to commit  the  object\n\noffenses was an essential  element of the conspiracy.   The court\n\ninstructed  the  jury  that  \"[w]hat  is necessary  is  that  the\n\ndefendant must have knowingly  and willfully participated in some\n\nway in the unlawful plan with the intent to further  the unlawful\n\npurpose of the  conspiracy.\"  Tr. Vol.  82 at 20.  We  review the\n\njury  charge as a whole to determine whether this instruction was\n\nerroneous.  Cupp v. Naughten, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108888\"><a href=\"/opinion/108888/cupp-v-naughten/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146-47 (1973).  \n                            \n\n     Although the insertion of  \"specific\" before \"intent\" may be\n\npreferable,  we find  the jury  charge sufficient.   We  upheld a\n\nsimilar instruction in United States v. Porter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453326\"><a href=\"/opinion/453326/united-states-v-paul-c-porter-united-states-v-walter-g-baker-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16-17\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1985),  which stated, \"you would have to  find that the\n\nperson  knew that  a conspiracy  existed and  voluntarily entered\n\ninto it  with the intent of  achieving the illegal  object of the\n\nagreement\".  Here,  the court defined  the terms \"knowingly\"  and\n\n\"willfully\" for the jury  before giving the disputed instruction.\n\nIn particular,  it defined  \"willfully\" to mean  \"voluntarily and\n\npurposefully with  the specific  intent to  do something the  law\n\nforbids.\"   Tr. Vol. 82 at 15.  The court thus clearly instructed\n\nthe jury that it  had to find that  Yefsky joined the  conspiracy\n\nwith the specific  intent to accomplish  the unlawful purpose  of\n\nthe   conspiracy,  namely  tax  and  mail  fraud.    Because  the\n\n                               -30-\n\ninstruction  adequately covered  specific intent,  Yefsky is  not\n\nentitled to any relief.   United States v.
