Appellant, St. Hilaire &amp; Associates, Inc.,\n                \n\nD/B/A Corso Electric Co., and  Albert St. Hilaire, appeal the\n\ndismissal  of  their  action  against  the   Federal  Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation [FDIC], as receiver for Numerica  Bank,\n\nFederal Savings  Bank [Numerica],  and  the Resolution  Trust\n\nCorporation  [RTC],  as  conservator   for  Homebank  Federal\n\nSavings  Association [Homebank FSA].  We vacate the dismissal\n\nand remand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n     We take the  following facts from the  record, accepting\n\nthe facts pleaded in the complaint as true.  In 1987 or 1988,\n\nAlbert St. Hilaire  [St. Hilaire], president of  St. Hilaire,\n\nInc. [the corporation],  sought financing from  Numerica Bank\n\nof  Manchester, New  Hampshire.   Subsequently,  officers and\n\nagents of  Numerica indicated to  St. Hilaire  that they  had\n\ntransferred to Homebank, Federal Savings Bank [Homebank FSB],\n\na  fully owned subsidiary  of Numerica.   They also requested\n\nthat he allow them to transfer the financing arrangements for\n\nthe corporation to Homebank FSB as well.  St. Hilaire agreed,\n\nand in 1988,  financing totalling approximately  $450,000 was\n\nprovided by Homebank  FSB.  In 1991, Homebank  FSB refused to\n\nextend further  credit to the corporation, and,  as a result,\n\nthe corporation was forced to cease business operations.\n\n     Effective  October  10,  1991,  Numerica  was   declared\n\ninsolvent and the  FDIC was appointed receiver.  Homebank FSB\n\nwas closed on the same date.  The  RTC was appointed receiver\n\n                             -2-\n\nof  Homebank FSB.    In  its capacity  as  receiver, the  RTC\n\nentered  into  a  Purchase  and   Assumption  Agreement  with\n\nHomebank FSA, whereby essentially all of the assets and  some\n\nof  the liabilities  of  Homebank  FSB  were  transferred  to\n\nHomebank  FSA.   Among  the assets  transferred were  the St.\n\nHilaire  notes. The RTC was appointed conservator of Homebank\n\nFSA.  \n\n     In 1992,  the RTC as conservator of Homebank FSA brought\n\nsuit against the corporation  and against St. Hilaire  in the\n\nUnited  States District  Court  for  the  District  of  Maine\n\nseeking  collection of  the notes.   In  their answer  to the\n\ncomplaint, St.  Hilaire and  the  corporation raised  various\n\naffirmative  defenses.    St. Hilaire  asked,  in particular,\n\nthat, if he were found  personally liable on the note, he  be\n\nallowed to set off any claims which he would have against the\n\nNumerica  and Homebank as  a result of  administrative claims\n\nwhich  he  had  already initiated  pursuant  to  12  U.S.C.  \n\n1821(d).    On October  23, 1992,  the court  granted summary\n\njudgment to the RTC and found St. Hilaire personally liable.\n\n     On  October 5,  1992, St.  Hilaire  and the  corporation\n\ninitiated  the instant  suit in  the  United States  District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire.  The complaint seeks\n\ndamages from the FDIC as receiver of Numerica and against the\n\nRTC as conservator  of Homebank FSA for breach  of an implied\n\ncovenant of good  faith and fair dealing; for  violation of a\n\n                             -3-\n\njoint  venture agreement; and for breach of an oral contract.\n\nThe RTC  as conservator  filed a  motion to  dismiss alleging\n\nthat  appellants  had  failed  to  file  a  claim  under  the\n\nadministrative claims  process prior to  commencing suit  and\n\nthat, therefore, the  federal court was  without jurisdiction\n\nto hear  the claim  pursuant to  12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(13)(D).\n\nThe RTC also sought dismissal on the grounds of res judicata.\n                                                            \n\nThe district court dismissed the entire case on the ground of\n\nlack of jurisdiction.   It did  not address the issue  of res\n                                                             \n\njudicata.\n        \n\n     As the FDIC notes in  its brief, \"[t]his appeal comes to\n\nthis Court in  a state of procedural confusion.\"   First, the\n\nFDIC advises  this court  that it  never moved  for dismissal\n\nbelow.      Not  only  should the  district  court  not  have\n\ndismissed  the  complaint  against the  FDIC  without  such a\n\nmotion,  see Greene v. Union Mut. Life Ins. Co., 764 F.2d 19,\n                                              \n\n21-22 (1st  Cir. 1985), but  the FDIC also admits  that it is\n\nnot  entitled  to such  relief since  appellants did  file an\n\nadministrative claim with the FDIC.  The claim was denied and\n\nhence is  properly before  the district court.   12  U.S.C.  \n\n1821(d)(6)(A).\n\n     Second, the  RTC as  conservator now  concedes that  the\n\nground  on  which  its  motion  to  dismiss  was granted  was\n\nimproper.  12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(13)(D) limits the jurisdiction\n\nof federal courts to those  parties who have exhausted  their\n\n                             -4-\n\nadministrative  remedies as regards claims against the RTC as\n                                                             \n\nreceiver.  Since  appellants in the instant  case have sought\n        \n\nrelief only  against the RTC in its  capacity as conservator,\n                                                            \n\nthe court erred in granting  dismissal for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.1  \n\n     The RTC now  asks this court to affirm  the dismissal on\n\nthe alternate ground of res judicata.  The essential elements\n                                    \n\nof res  judicata are  a final  judgment on  the merits  in an\n                \n\nearlier action between identical parties or their privies and\n\nan  identity of  causes of  action in  the earlier  and later\n\nsuits.  See, e.g., Kale v. Combined  Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161,\n                                            \n\n1165  (1st Cir),  cert. denied,  112  S.Ct. 69  (1991).   The\n                              \n\ndecision by the United States  District Court of the District\n\nof  Maine is  clearly a  final  judgment between  the RTC  as\n\nconservator and the appellants.  \n\n     However, we think it is  unwise to attempt to  determine\n\nthe res  judicata issue in  the first instance.   It  was not\n                 \n\naddressed by the district court and  has not been extensively\n\nbriefed  in this court.  Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal\n\nas to the  RTC without prejudice  to its right to  assert the\n\nres judicata defense on remand in the district court.\n            \n\n     The order  dismissing the  action against  the FDIC  and\n\nagainst  the RTC  is vacated  and  the case  is remanded  for\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellants  do not appear to accept this concession since\nthey continue  to argue that  they in fact did  exhaust their\nadministrative remedies.\n\n                             -5-\n\nfurther proceedings.  No costs.\n\n                             -6-\n",

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453327\"><a href=\"/opinion/453327/howard-greene-v-union-mutual-life-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1985), but the FDIC also admits that it is not entitled to such relief since appellants did file an administrative claim with the FDIC.  The claim was denied and hence is properly before the district court.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(6)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the RTC as conservator now concedes that the ground on which its motion to dismiss was granted was improper.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(13)(D) limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to those parties who have exhausted their administrative remedies as regards claims against the RTC as receiver.  Since appellants in the instant case have sought relief only against the RTC in its capacity as conservator, the court erred in granting dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC now asks this court to affirm the dismissal on the alternate ground of res judicata.  The essential elements of res judicata are a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action between identical parties or their privies and an identity of causes of action in the earlier and later suits.   See, e.g., Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555434\"><a href=\"/opinion/555434/carl-kale-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1165 (1st Cir), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span> (1991).  The decision by the United States District Court of the District of Maine is clearly a final judgment between the RTC as conservator and the appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we think it is unwise to attempt to determine the res judicata issue in the first instance.  It was not addressed by the district court and has not been extensively briefed in this court.  Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal as to the RTC without prejudice to its right to assert the res judicata defense on remand in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order dismissing the action against the FDIC and against the RTC is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellants do not appear to accept this concession since they continue to argue that they in fact did exhaust their administrative remedies</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
