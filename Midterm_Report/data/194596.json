The issue  on this\n\nappeal   is  whether   such  a   requirement  violates   the  Age\n\nDiscrimination  in  Employment  Act  (ADEA),  81  Stat.  602,  as\n\namended, 29 U.S.C.   621 et seq. (1990).  We hold that it does.\n                                \n\n                                I.\n\n          In   1977,   Massachusetts   enacted  Chapter   32   of\n\nMassachusetts General Laws to regulate its retirement systems and\n\npensions.    One component  of Chapter 32,  Section 90F, requires\n\nGroup  1   employees  of  the  Commonwealth   and  its  political\n\nsubdivisions who are  seventy years of  age or older  to pass  an\n\nannual   medical  examination   as   a  condition   of  continued\n\nemployment.1 \n\n                       \n\n   1Section 90F provides in its entirety:\n\n          Any member in service classified in Group 1, or any\n          other person who would be classified in Group 1\n          except for the fact that he is not a member, shall\n          continue in service, at his option, notwithstanding\n          the fact that he has attained age seventy; provided,\n          however, that he is mentally and physically capable\n          of performing the duties of his office or position. \n          Such member or other person shall annually, at his\n          own expense, be examined by an impartial physician\n          designated by the retirement authority to determine\n          such capability.  No deductions shall be made from\n          the regular compensation of such member or other\n          person under the provisions of this chapter for\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nGroup  1  employees   are  \"[o]fficials  and   general  employees\n\nincluding   clerical,   administrative  and   technical  workers,\n\nlaborers,  mechanics and  all others  not otherwise  classified.\"\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 32,   3(2)(g)  (1992).  Under the  regulations\n\nenacted  pursuant to section 90F,  no later than  120 days before\n\nthe last day of  the month when a Group 1 employee will reach the\n\nage  of seventy,  the retirement board  of which  he or  she is a\n\nmember notifies him or her of the retirement benefits to which he\n\nor she would  be entitled  if he  or she  retired at  the age  of\n\nseventy.   In  order  to remain  in employment  after the  age of\n\nseventy,  the employee must complete an application and submit to\n\na medical  examination by  a physician  designated by  the board.\n\nUpon receipt of the report of the physician, the retirement board\n\nvotes to decide  whether to grant the  application for permission\n\nto  continue  in service.   If  the  application is  granted, the\n\nemployee must repeat the  process each year.  If  the application\n\nis denied, the employee is  retired on the last day of  the month\n\nof his  or her birth.   Mass. Regs. Code tit.  840,   11.01-11.02\n\n(1992).\n\n                       \n\n          service after he has attained age seventy and upon\n          retirement such member or other person shall receive\n          a superannuation retirement allowance equal to that\n          which he would have been entitled had he retired at\n          age seventy.\n\n   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 32,   90F.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\n          Barnstable  County Retirement Association (BCRA) is one\n\nof the  106 public retirement systems governed by   90F.  In 1988\n\nthe BCRA required Mary  Cavender, a librarian employed by  a town\n\nin  Massachusetts,  to pass  a  medical examination  in  order to\n\ncontinue  her employment with the  town.  She  passed the medical\n\nexamination  and was  allowed  to continue  her  employment.   No\n\nemployees  have been forced  to retire  since    90F has  been in\n\neffect.  \n\n          On September  9, 1989, the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission  (EEOC) brought  suit  against  Massachusetts and  the\n\nBCRA.   The  EEOC alleged  that the  requirements  of    90F that\n\nMassachusetts  state and  local employees  aged seventy  or older\n\ntake and pass  an annual  medical examination as  a condition  of\n\ncontinued employment was violative of,  and hence preempted by,  \n\n4(a)  of the  Age  Discrimination in  Employment  Act (ADEA),  29\n\nU.S.C.   623(a).  Section 4(a) provides: \n\n          It shall be  unlawful for  an employer (1)  to fail  or\n          refuse  to  hire  or  to discharge  any  individual  or\n          otherwise  discriminate  against  any  individual  with\n          respect  to  his  compensation,  terms,  conditions, or\n          privileges  of employment, because of such individual's\n          age; (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n          in any way which  would deprive or tend to  deprive any\n          individual  of  employment  opportunities or  otherwise\n          adversely affect his status  as an employee, because of\n          such individual's age; or (3)  to reduce the wage  rate\n          of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n            Following  discovery, all  parties moved  for summary\n\njudgment.    The  EEOC  argued  in  its  motion  that    90F  was\n\ndiscriminatory  on   its  face   and  that  defendants   had  not\n\nestablished  a  justification  for  using  age  as  a  factor  in\n\ndetermining  who would  be required  to take  and pass  a medical\n\nexamination   as    a   condition   of    continued   employment.\n\nMassachusetts'  answer in  its  motion for  summary judgment  was\n\ntwofold: first,  it  argued  that    4(a)  of the  ADEA  was  not\n\napplicable to the dispute because    90F was not preempted by the\n\nADEA; second, and in the alternative, Massachusetts argued that  \n\n90F did not violate the ADEA because concerns over the fitness of\n\nemployees, rather than age, was the basis of the statute.  \n\n          On   April  17,  1992,   the  district   court  granted\n\ndefendants'  motions for  summary  judgment, denying  the  EEOC's\n\nmotion.   The court reasoned that the regulation of its employees\n\nhas traditionally been one  of the historic powers of  the state.\n\nAccording  to the  court, the  Supreme Court  held in  Gregory v.\n                                                                 \n\nAshcroft, 111 S.Ct. 2395,  115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991), that  Congress\n        \n\nshould make its intention  clear and manifest when it  intends to\n\npreempt  the historic powers  of the state.   In the  view of the\n\ncourt, Congress, in enacting the ADEA, did not make  it clear and\n\nmanifest that  it intended to \"limit  employer-states' ability to\n\nassess  the fitness  of their  employees.\"   Moreover, the  court\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\ncontinued, the  practice of requiring employees  seventy years of\n\nage  or  older to  undergo an  annual  medical examination  \"is a\n\npractice very conducive  to the  health and well  being of  those\n\nemployed by state  government as  well as by  society at  large.\"\n\nThus, the  court concluded,   90F is not preempted by, and is not\n\nviolative of, the ADEA, and for the court to hold otherwise would\n\nbe \"to indulge in judicial legislation to override the balance of\n\nfederal and state powers.\"\n\n          The  EEOC now  appeals  the district  court's grant  of\n\nsummary judgment.  The EEOC requests that we reverse the grant of\n\nsummary judgment  in  favor  of  appellees  and  that  we  remand\n\ndirecting the  district court  to enter  summary judgment  in its\n\nfavor.  The  EEOC makes three  main arguments in  support of  its\n\nappeal.  First,  the EEOC reiterates that   90F violates the ADEA\n\non  its  face.   Second,  the EEOC  maintains that  age,  and not\n\nconcerns over employee fitness, is the basis for   90F.  Finally,\n\nthe  EEOC argues that    90F does  not qualify for  the bona fide\n\nemployee benefit exception of the ADEA.  \n\n                               II.\n\n          Rule  56(c) of  the  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure\n\nprovides that  summary judgment  \"shall be rendered  forthwith if\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nadmissions on file,  together with the  affidavits, if any,  show\n\nthat there is no genuine  issue as to any material fact  and that\n\nthe moving party  is entitled to a judgment as  a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 56(c).    We exercise plenary  review of summary\n\njudgment dispositions.  Olivera v.  Nestle Puerto Rico, Inc., 922\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  43, 44-45  (1st Cir.  1990).   The facts  of this  case, as\n\nrecounted above,  are not in dispute.   So, we turn  first to the\n\nissue of whether   90F is preempted by the ADEA.\n\n                                A.\n\n            Congress has  the power to preempt  state legislation\n\nunder the  Supremacy Clause  of Article VI  of the  Constitution.\n\nFederal  preemption  law  recognizes  two  types  of  preemption,\n\nexpress  and implied.  Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n293,  300, 108 S.Ct. 1145, 99 L.Ed.2d 316 (1988); Wisconsin Publ.\n                                                                 \n\nIntervenor,  et al. v. Mortier, 111 S.Ct. 2476, 2482, 115 L.Ed.2d\n                              \n\n532 (1991); see  also Wood v. General Motors  Corp., 865 F.2d 395\n                                                   \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).  Express preemption occurs  when Congress states\n\nin  the  text of  legislation that  it  intends to  preempt state\n\nlegislation in  the area.   In  the  absence of  such a  specific\n\nstatement,  a federal statute  may also preempt  by implication a\n\nstate statute.   The United  States Supreme Court  has identified\n\nthe circumstances under which such implied preemption may occur: \n\n          In the absence of explicit statutory language, however,\n          Congress implicitly may indicate  an intent to occupy a\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          given  field to  the exclusion  of state  law.   Such a\n          purpose may be inferred  where the pervasiveness of the\n          federal  regulation  precludes  supplementation by  the\n          States,  where the  federal  interest in  the field  is\n          sufficiently dominant,  or where the \"object  sought to\n          be  obtained by the  federal law  and the  character of\n          obligations  imposed  by  it  .  .  .  reveal  the same\n          purpose.\"     Finally,  even  where  Congress  has  not\n                                                                 \n          entirely displaced  state  regulation in  a  particular\n                                                                 \n          field,  state   law  is  pre-empted  when  it  actually\n                                                                 \n          conflicts with  federal law.   Such a conflict  will be\n                                     \n          found \"'when it is impossible to comply with both state\n          and  federal law, or where  the state law  stands as an\n          obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and\n          objectives of Congress.'\"\n\nSchneidewind, 485 U.S. at  299-300 (citations omitted)  (emphasis\n            \n\nadded).  \n\n          Before  the  district court  the  EEOC  argued, and  on\n\nappeal it reiterates, that    90F actually conflicts with    4(a)\n\ndue  to  the  impossibility  of  complying  with  both  statutes.\n\nSpecifically, the  EEOC maintains that, since  only employees who\n\nare seventy  years of age or  older are required to  take and are\n\nforced  to retire if they  fail an annual  medical examination,  \n\n90F  conflicts  with    4(a) of  the  ADEA providing  that  it is\n\nunlawful  for  an  employer \"to  discharge  .  .  . or  otherwise\n\ndiscriminate against any  individual with  respect to his  . .  .\n\nterms, conditions,  or privileges  of employment because  of such\n\nindividual's age.\" 29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1).   \n\n          The   district  court  rejected  the  EEOC's  argument,\n\nfinding  that in  ADEA cases,  Congress must  expressly state  an\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nintention in order  for courts to find federal preemption.    The\n\ncourt  determined  that  the  recent Supreme  Court  decision  in\n\nGregory  v.  Ashcroft had  changed  the  standards for  resolving\n                     \n\nconflicts  between local  and  federal  government, deferring  to\n\nstate  sovereignty.   According to  the court,  \"in an  effort to\n\npreserve our federal system of government, the Supreme  Court has\n\nindicated  that  Congress should  make  its  intention clear  and\n\nmanifest  if it  intends to  preempt the  historic powers  of the\n\nstates.\" quoting Gregory v.  Ashcroft, 111 S.Ct. at 2401.   Under\n                                     \n\nthis  new standard, the district court concluded that the ADEA is\n\nambiguous as to whether the statute was intended to apply to such\n\nstate legislation  as    90F: \"[I]t  appears ambiguous,  and even\n\nunlikely, that Congress intended to outlaw a method of assessment\n\nutilized  by a  state  government which  requires annual  medical\n\nexaminations for its employees at the age of seventy.\" \n\n          It is true that the Gregory Court was unwavering in its\n                                     \n\ndesire to protect state sovereignty and principles of federalism.\n\nId.  at 2399.   However, its reasoning and  holding were far more\n   \n\nnarrow  and limited  than the  broad and  sweeping interpretation\n\nmade  by the  district  court.   In  Gregory, the  United  States\n                                            \n\nSupreme  Court rendered a decision on  the effects of the ADEA on\n\nthe  Missouri Constitution which required mandatory retirement of\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\njudges.2  Mo.  Const. art. V,    26.  The relevant  clause of the\n\nADEA provided: \n\n          The term \"employee\" means an individual employed by any\n          employer  except that  the  term \"employee\"  shall  not\n          include  any person  elected  to public  office in  any\n          State  or political  subdivision  of any  State by  the\n          qualified voters thereof, or  any person chosen by such\n          officer to be on  such officer's personal staff,  or an\n          appointee on  the policy  making level or  an immediate\n          adviser   with  respect   to   the   exercise  of   the\n          constitutional or legal powers of the office. \n\n29 U.S.C.    630(f).   Due to  the method of  selection of  state\n\njudges in  Missouri, it was  unclear whether they  were employees\n\nwithin the meaning of   630(f).  \n\n          It was  ultimately the ambiguity of  the judges' status\n\nas employees or policymakers which the Court found fatal to their\n\ncapacity  to be protected by  the ADEA.   Because Missouri judges\n\n                       \n\n   2Three years before the Supreme Court decided Gregory, the\n                                                        \n   First Circuit adjudicated precisely the same issue.  EEOC v.\n                                                               \n   Massachusetts, 858 F.2d 52 (1st Cir. 1988).  In that case,\n                \n   the court had to determine the effect of the 1987 amendments\n   to the ADEA on a provision of the Massachusetts Constitution\n   which made age 70 the mandatory retirement age for all state\n   judges.  The court affirmed the district court's\n   determination that the Act did not override the state\n   constitutional provision, finding that the state's judges\n   fell within the policy-making exception to employees\n   protected by the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.   630(f).  The court even\n   relied on the same rationale of respect for principles of\n   sovereignty, as did the Court in Gregory: \"Without question,\n                                           \n   the tenure of state judges is a question of exceeding\n   importance to each state, and a question traditionally left\n   to be answered by each state.  Any federal encroachment on a\n   state's freedom of choice in this area, therefore, strikes\n   very close to the heart of state sovereignty.\"  EEOC, 858\n                                                       \n   F.2d at 54.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nwere subject to retention  elections, they could be  construed as\n\nelected  officials, thus excluded from the ADEA.  It was unclear,\n\nhowever, whether state  court judges were state  officials on the\n\n\"policy-making level.\"  The Gregory Court aptly held that,  where\n                                   \n\nprovisions  are  ambiguous and  state  sovereignty  is at  issue,\n                              \n\ncourts should  reason carefully when making  determinations as to\n\npreemption.  Gregory,   111  S.Ct.  at   2401.     \"Congressional\n                    \n\ninterference  with  this  decision  of the  people  of  Missouri,\n\ndefining  their constitutional  officers, would  upset  the usual\n\nconstitutional balance of  federal and  state powers.   For  this\n\nreason, 'it is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of\n\nCongress' intent before finding  that federal law overrides' this\n\nbalance.\"  Id.  (quoting Atascadero State  Hosp. v. Scanlon,  473\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (determining\n\nwhether  federal statute  abrogated sovereign immunity  of states\n\nunder the 11th Amendment)).  Based on that reasoning, the Gregory\n                                                                 \n\nCourt  concluded  that  the  ADEA did  not  preempt  the Missouri\n\nConstitution's mandatory requirement for judges.

The Missouri constitutional\n\nprovision  was concerned,  not with  regulating health  care, but\n\nwith ensuring the qualifications  of the highest state officials.\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\n\"The[] cases [cited] stand in recognition of the authority of the\n\npeople of  the States  to determine the  qualifications of  their\n\nmost  important government  officials.\"   Gregory,  111 S.Ct.  at\n                                                 \n\n2402;  see also  EEOC v.

The  Court  made it  clear that  its\n       \n\ndeference  arises not from  a disdain for  preemption doctrine in\n\nthe context of the ADEA, but rather because: \n\n          the  case concerns  a  state  constitutional  provision\n          through  which  the  people  of  Missouri  establish  a\n          qualification for those who sit  as their judges.  This\n                                                                 \n          provision goes beyond  an area traditionally  regulated\n                                                                 \n          by the States; it is a decision of the most fundamental\n                                                                 \n          sort  for a sovereign entity.  Through the structure of\n                                       \n          its government, and the character of those who exercise\n          government  authority,  a  State  defines  itself as  a\n          sovereign.  \n\nId. at 2400 (emphasis added).  \n   \n\n          Thus,  while  Gregory   refused  to   find  the   state\n                               \n\nConstitution preempted by the ADEA, the opinion was unequivocally\n\nclear in  the narrowness  of its  holding.  At  no point  did the\n\nCourt suggest that all state regulations of public employees  are\n\nquestions at the heart of state  sovereignty.  Nor did it suggest\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nthat  Gregory  would be  controlling  on  the federal  preemption\n             \n\ndoctrine where there was not any ambiguity in the language of the\n\nstatute.   The Court stated:  \"The ADEA plainly covers all  state\n\nemployees  except those excluded by one of the exceptions.  Where\n\nit is unambiguous that  an employee does  not fall within one  of\n\nthe exceptions, the Act states plainly and unequivocally that the\n\nemployee is included.\"  Id. at 2404.\n                           \n\n          The   district   court   erred,   not   only   in   its\n\ninterpretation as to the breadth of the Gregory holding, but also\n                                               \n\nin its  applicability to the  instant case.   Here, there  are no\n\nambiguities in  the terms or provisions of   90F that should give\n\nus  pause as to whether  those affected are  employees within the\n\nmeaning of   4(a).  The district court determined that the effect\n\nof  the 1986 congressional amendment to the ADEA on statutes such\n\nas  Massachusetts'  is  de  facto  ambiguous.    Such  reasoning,\n\nhowever, begs the  threshold question of preemption.  In Gregory,\n                                                                \n\nthe text of the ADEA itself is unclear as to its applicability to\n\njudges, giving  rise to  ambiguity which  the  Court resolved  in\n\nMissouri's favor.  Here, there is no textual uncertainty, and the\n\nproper method of resolving  the issue is to analyze  the conflict\n\nunder  the  standards  of  preemption  doctrine,  something   the\n\ndistrict court never did.  \n\n                                B.\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\n            To  recapitulate,  \"in  the  absence  of  an  express\n\ncongressional  command,  state  law  is  preempted  if  that  law\n\nactually conflicts with federal law.\" Cipollone v. Liggett Group,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 112 S.Ct.  2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d  407 (1992).  State  law\n    \n\nconflicts  with  federal  law  when compliance  with  both  is  a\n\nphysical  impossibility.    See,  e.g., Greenwood  Trust  Co.  v.\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts, 971 F.2d 818 (1st Cir. 1992); Pedraza v. Shell Oil\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 942 F.2d 48 (1st Cir. 1991). 3 \n   \n\n          Under    90F,  retirement boards  are required  to take\n\nspecific action upon the  seventieth birthday of state employees.\n\nThe  possible result of this action is the involuntary retirement\n\nof state employees who fail to pass the requisite tests.    \n\nSuch action is not reconcilable with the plain purpose of    4(a)\n\nwhich   prohibits  employers  from   discrimination  against  any\n\nindividual with respect  to his compensation,  terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.   \n\n                       \n\n   3The district court's opinion focuses on the reasonableness\n   of the state's method of implementing the dual goals of\n   enabling state employees to continue working and ensuring\n   their competency.  This is not, however, an equal protection\n   analysis in which rational and legitimate state interests\n   are to be respected by the courts.  Under preemption\n   analysis, the focus is not on the purposes of the\n   Commonwealth's statute, but on the interaction between the\n   state statute and the federal statute in question.  In the\n   context of the ADEA, reasonableness only enters into\n   judicial analysis in assessments of affirmative defenses\n   available under   4(f).\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\n          For  example,  in EEOC  v. Wyoming,  460 U.S.  226, 103\n                                            \n\nS.Ct.  1054, 75 L.Ed.2d  18 (1983), the  Supreme Court considered\n\nwhether a Wyoming  statute, which required game  and fish wardens\n\nwho had reached age 55 to seek the approval of  their employer in\n\norder   to  remain  employed,  violated  the  ADEA.      Much  as\n\nMassachusetts  does  here, Wyoming  argued  that  the statute  in\n\nquestion did not violate the ADEA on its face because the statute\n\nserved  in assuring  the  physical preparedness  of Wyoming  game\n\nwardens to perform their duties.  The Court rejected the argument\n\nand  concluded that Wyoming could continue the statute only if it\n\ncould demonstrate age was  a bona fide occupational qualification\n\nfor the job of game warden.  Id. at 239. Significantly, the Court\n                                \n\nwrote:\n\n          Under the ADEA,  [] the  State may still,  at the  very\n          least,  assess  the fitness  of  its  game wardens  and\n          dismiss those  wardens whom  it reasonably finds  to be\n          unfit.   Put another way, the Act requires the State to\n          achieve its goals in  a more individualized and careful\n          manner than  would otherwise be  the case, but  it does\n          not  require the State  to abandon  those goals,  or to\n          abandon the public policy decisions underlying them.\n\nId. \n   \n          Similarly,  here Massachusetts  may  still  assess  the\n\nfitness  of its  employees and  dismiss  those employees  whom it\n\nreasonably  finds to  be unfit.   But it  must do  so \"in  a more\n\nindividualized and careful manner\"  than the scheme envisioned by\n\n   90F.   In other  words, Massachusetts  is not  being asked  to\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nabandon  the  public policy  of  determining the  fitness  of its\n\nemployees, just as  Wyoming was  not being asked  to abandon  the\n\npublic  policy of  determining the  physical preparedness  of its\n\ngame wardens.   Instead, pursuant  to the ADEA,  just as  Wyoming\n\ncould not  arbitrarily pick 55 years of age as the point at which\n\nto  measure  the  physical  preparedness  of  its  game  wardens,\n\nMassachusetts  may not arbitrarily set up seventy years of age as\n\nthe point at which to determine the fitness of its employees. \n\n          The Supreme Court concluded in EEOC v. Wyoming:\n                                                        \n\n          [Wyoming] remain[s] free under  the ADEA to continue to\n          do precisely  what  [it  is]  doing now,  if  [it]  can\n          demonstrate  that  age  is a  \"bona  fide  occupational\n          qualification\"  for the job of game warden. . ..  [T]he\n          state's discretion to  achieve its goals in  the way it\n          thinks best is not being overridden entirely, but it is\n          merely   being  tested  against  a  reasonable  federal\n          standard.\n\nId. at 240.  Here, Massachusetts' discretion to achieve its goals\n   \n\nof determining  the  fitness of  its  employees is  being  tested\n\nagainst a reasonable federal standard.  And, in the absence of an\n\naffirmative defense,  we must conclude that  compliance with both\n\nthe  state  and federal  statutes  is  a physical  impossibility,\n\nmeaning that the ADEA must preempt the Massachusetts law.\n\n          The two  statutes are  also in actual  conflict because\n\nenforcement of the Massachusetts law creates an  obstacle for the\n\nimplementation  of the goals of  the ADEA.   Congress enacted the\n\nADEA  to   prevent   the  arbitrary   and  socially   destructive\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\ndiscrimination  on  the  basis of  age.

Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 120, 105\n                                         \n\nS.Ct.  613, 83  L.Ed.2d 523  (1985).   The United  States Supreme\n\nCourt has explained  that the  ADEA is of  particular force  when\n\nmandatory  retirement is at issue, as it  is here.  Criswell, 472\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  410.   In  the words  of the  Court, \"[t]he  legislative\n\nhistory of the 1978 Amendments to the ADEA makes quite clear that\n\nthe  policies and  substantive provisions  of the Act  apply with\n\nespecial force  in the case of  mandatory retirement provisions.\"\n\nId.  Moreover, \"[t]hroughout the legislative history of the ADEA,\n   \n\none  empirical  fact is  repeatedly  emphasized:  the process  of\n\npsychological  and physiological  degeneration  caused  by  aging\n\nvaries with  each individual.\"  Id. at 409.   Thus, the  ADEA was\n                                   \n\nenacted in  large part to  prevent mandatory retirement  based on\n\n\"innocent\" misperceptions as to the abilities of older employees,\n\nas well as more insidious \"business\" judgments as to their cost. \n\n          Here, the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts allows  age to\n\nbe the determinant as to when an employee's deterioration will be\n\nso  significant  that it  requires  special  treatment.   Such  a\n\nconception  of and  use  of age  as  a criteria  for decline  and\n\nunfitness for employment strikes at  the heart of the ADEA.   The\n\nentire  point of  the statute  is to  force employers  to abandon\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\nprevious stereotypes about the  abilities and capacities of older\n\nworkers.  Employers may  still regulate and condition employment,\n\nbut they may no longer immediately  turn to age as a  convenient,\n\nsimple criterion.  They must be prepared  to justify their use of\n\nage rather than individualized factors.    \n\n          In finding that  the ADEA  did not preempt    90F,  the\n\ndistrict  court reasoned that    90F is  \"an Act  relating to the\n\nqualifications  of  state  employees  which  was  lawful  and  an\n\neminently  reasonable expression  of state  power  when enacted.\"\n\nThus, the Court concluded, to hold   90F as preempted by the ADEA\n\nwould  be \"to  indulge in  judicial  legislation to  override the\n\nbalance  of federal  and  state powers.\"    No one  disputes  the\n\nproposition  that  the  historic  functions  of   regulating  the\n\nrelationship  between the  public  employer and  public employees\n\nhave traditionally been  left to the states.  But  it is also far\n\ntoo  late in  the day to  argue that  Congress does  not have the\n\npower to  require states  to regulate the  public employer\\public\n\nemployee relationship in a non-discriminatory fashion. 4  \n\n          Because the district court  rested its grant of summary\n\njudgment  for  the defendants  solely  on  its interpretation  of\n\n                       \n\n   4Case law supports the application of other federal anti-\n   discrimination statutes to state employment relationships. \n   See EEOC v. County of Allegheny, 705 F.2d 679, 682 (3d Cir.\n                                  \n   1983); Rosenfeld v.

The\n\nappellees,  however, reassert  those  defenses on  appeal and  we\n\naddress them next.  \n\n                               III.\n\n            Appellees   argue  that, even  if the  annual medical\n\nexamination requirement is found  to conflict with   4(a)  of the\n\nADEA,    90F is still  exempt from the  prohibitory provisions of\n\nthe  ADEA under exceptions denoted in    4(f)(1) and   4(f)(2) of\n\nthe ADEA.  \n\n                                A.\n\n          Section 4(f)(1) provides that \"It shall not be unlawful\n\nfor an employer, employment agency,  or labor organization (1) to\n\ntake any  action otherwise prohibited .  . . where age  is a bona\n\nfide  occupational  qualification  reasonably  necessary  to  the\n\nnormal  operation  of  the  particular  business,  or  where  the\n                                                                 \n\ndifferentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age . .\n                                                             \n\n. .\" (emphasis added).\n\n          According to appellees, there is a possibility that the\n\nphysical examinations could be based on a reasonable factor other\n\nthan  age.   They argue  that in  interpreting    90F,  our focus\n\nshould be not on the age requirement which triggers the condition\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\nof  continuing  employment,   but  rather,  on   the  examination\n\nrequirement  itself.     Employees  over  seventy   will  not  be\n\ninvoluntarily retired because they  are over seventy, but because\n\ntheir mental and or physical faculties are failing.  \n\n          We cannot accept this argument. In Los Angeles Dep't of\n                                                                 \n\nWater &amp; Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d\n                        \n\n657  (1978), the Supreme Court  confronted and rejected a similar\n\nargument.    Manhart  involved  a  policy  of   the  Los  Angeles\n                    \n\nDepartment of Water and Power requiring larger contributions from\n\nwomen  than men to the Department's pension fund because women as\n\na group live longer than do men as  a group.  A class made up  of\n\nwomen employed or formerly  employed by the department challenged\n\nthe policy as a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964.  Plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  contribution  differential\n\nconstituted  discrimination on the basis of  sex.  The Department\n\nanswered that sex was not the factor on which the distinction was\n\nbeing  drawn;  it  was  longevity.    The   Court  rejected  this\n\ncontention,  holding that but for  their sex, women  would not be\n\nrequired  to pay more for  their retirement benefits.   The Court\n\nacknowledged that as a class women  tend to live longer than men.\n\nManhart,  435 U.S. at 707.  But the  Court found it to be equally\n       \n\ntrue  that all individuals in the respective classes do not share\n\nthe   characteristics  that   differentiate  the   average  class\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\nrepresentatives.  Id. at 708.  Thus, the Court reasoned that even\n                     \n\nwhere  characteristics  may  be class-based,  Title  VII requires\n\nfairness to individuals rather than to classes. Id.   In response\n                                                   \n\nto  the   Department's  specific  argument  that   the  different\n\ncontributions exacted from men and women were based on the factor\n\nof longevity rather than sex, the Court wrote: \n\n          It is plain [] that any individual's life expectancy is\n          based on a number of factors, of which sex is only one.\n          The record  contains no evidence that  any factor other\n          than  the  employee's sex  was  taken  into account  in\n          calculating the []  differential between the respective\n          contributions by men  and women. . ..  [O]ne cannot say\n          that an actuarial distinction  based entirely on sex is\n          \"based  on any other factor  than sex.   Sex is exactly\n          what it is based on.\"\n\nId.\n   \n\n          Similarly,  here appellees  argue that  the requirement\n\nthat  employees aged  seventy  or older  pass  an annual  medical\n\nexamination is based  on fitness rather  than age.   But, as  the\n\nSupreme  Court found in Manhart, it is clear that an individual's\n                               \n\nfitness to work is based on a number of factors,  of which age is\n\nonly  one.  And,  as in Manhart, the  record contains no evidence\n                               \n\nthat  any factor  other than  the employee's  age was  taken into\n\naccount  in requiring an annual medical examination.  Thus, as in\n\nManhart, we are forced to conclude that age is exactly what   90F\n       \n\nis  based on.   The reasonable  factor other than  age defense is\n\nsimply not applicable to   90F. \n\n                               -21-\n                                21\n\n           Appellees  argue  that   Manhart  gave  only   cursory\n                                           \n\ntreatment  to this issue and that because it predated Gregory, it\n                                                             \n\nhas less weight.  Both assertions  are incorrect.  As an  initial\n\nmatter,  Manhart   is  clear   in  holding  that   the  sex-based\n                \n\ndifferentiation in question   could not be  justified.  Moreover,\n\nin  Gregory  the  reasonable  factor defense  was  never  raised.\n           \n\nFinally,  while Manhart does arise out of  Title VII  and not out\n                       \n\nof the ADEA,   the First Circuit, like the  United States Supreme\n\nCourt, has made clear that the  ADEA tracks the law of Title VII.\n\nThurston, 469 U.S.  at 121; Rivas  v.

Although  the  Court  remanded   the  case  for\n\nresolution of  this issue,  it held:  \"As  a result  of the  1978\n\namendments,   4(f)(2) cannot be used to justify forced retirement\n\non account  of age.\"  Betts, 492 U.S.  at 166 n.2.  Similarly, in\n                           \n\nThurston, 469 U.S. at 124,  the Court stated that in  the context\n        \n\nof   4(f)(2), \"any seniority  system that includes the challenged\n                                                                 \n\npractice is  not 'bona fide' under the  statute.\"  See also Betts\n                                                                 \n\nv.

It  regulates not  \"fringe\n\nbenefits,\" but  the heart of the  employment relationship itself.\n\nSection  90F clearly  forces retirement  in precisely  the manner\n\n                               -25-\n                                25\n\nwhich the Supreme Court  explicitly found to be beyond  the scope\n\nof the exemption.5\n\n                               IV.\n\n           In conclusion, we hold that   90F is violative of, and\n\nis  preempted by, the ADEA  because it stands  in direct conflict\n\nwith    4(a)  of the  ADEA.   Specifically,  Massachusetts cannot\n\ncomply   with  the   ADEA  prohibition   that  no   employer  may\n\ndiscriminate against  any individual because of  age with respect\n\nto compensation,  terms, conditions or privileges  of employment,\n\nwhile at the same  time requiring employees seventy years  of age\n\nor older to pass an annual  medical examination as a condition of\n\ncontinued employment pursuant to   90F.  We also hold  that   90F\n\nis not exempt from the requirements  of the ADEA based on  either\n\nof the two  exemptions provided in   4(f)(1) or    4(f)(2) of the\n\nADEA.  Under    4(f)(1),  we cannot  rationally conclude that the\n\ndistinction among employees for the purpose of implementing   90F\n\nis  based on  any reasonable  factor other  than age.     Under  \n\n4(f)(2),  we cannot rationally find that   90F satisfies the bona\n\nfide employee  benefit plan exemption.

The issue  on this\n\nappeal   is  whether   such  a   requirement  violates   the  Age\n\nDiscrimination  in  Employment  Act  (ADEA),  81  Stat.  602,  as\n\namended, 29 U.S.C.   621 et seq. (1990).  We hold that it does.\n                                \n\n                                I.\n\n          In   1977,   Massachusetts   enacted  Chapter   32   of\n\nMassachusetts General Laws to regulate its retirement systems and\n\npensions.    One component  of Chapter 32,  Section 90F, requires\n\nGroup  1   employees  of  the  Commonwealth   and  its  political\n\nsubdivisions who are  seventy years of  age or older  to pass  an\n\nannual   medical  examination   as   a  condition   of  continued\n\nemployment.1 \n\n                       \n\n   1Section 90F provides in its entirety:\n\n          Any member in service classified in Group 1, or any\n          other person who would be classified in Group 1\n          except for the fact that he is not a member, shall\n          continue in service, at his option, notwithstanding\n          the fact that he has attained age seventy; provided,\n          however, that he is mentally and physically capable\n          of performing the duties of his office or position. \n          Such member or other person shall annually, at his\n          own expense, be examined by an impartial physician\n          designated by the retirement authority to determine\n          such capability.  No deductions shall be made from\n          the regular compensation of such member or other\n          person under the provisions of this chapter for\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nGroup  1  employees   are  \"[o]fficials  and   general  employees\n\nincluding   clerical,   administrative  and   technical  workers,\n\nlaborers,  mechanics and  all others  not otherwise  classified.\"\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 32,   3(2)(g)  (1992).  Under the  regulations\n\nenacted  pursuant to section 90F,  no later than  120 days before\n\nthe last day of  the month when a Group 1 employee will reach the\n\nage  of seventy,  the retirement board  of which  he or  she is a\n\nmember notifies him or her of the retirement benefits to which he\n\nor she would  be entitled  if he  or she  retired at  the age  of\n\nseventy.   In  order  to remain  in employment  after the  age of\n\nseventy,  the employee must complete an application and submit to\n\na medical  examination by  a physician  designated by  the board.\n\nUpon receipt of the report of the physician, the retirement board\n\nvotes to decide  whether to grant the  application for permission\n\nto  continue  in service.   If  the  application is  granted, the\n\nemployee must repeat the  process each year.  If  the application\n\nis denied, the employee is  retired on the last day of  the month\n\nof his  or her birth.   Mass. Regs. Code tit.  840,   11.01-11.02\n\n(1992).\n\n                       \n\n          service after he has attained age seventy and upon\n          retirement such member or other person shall receive\n          a superannuation retirement allowance equal to that\n          which he would have been entitled had he retired at\n          age seventy.\n\n   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 32,   90F.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\n          Barnstable  County Retirement Association (BCRA) is one\n\nof the  106 public retirement systems governed by   90F.  In 1988\n\nthe BCRA required Mary  Cavender, a librarian employed by  a town\n\nin  Massachusetts,  to pass  a  medical examination  in  order to\n\ncontinue  her employment with the  town.  She  passed the medical\n\nexamination  and was  allowed  to continue  her  employment.   No\n\nemployees  have been forced  to retire  since    90F has  been in\n\neffect.  \n\n          On September  9, 1989, the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission  (EEOC) brought  suit  against  Massachusetts and  the\n\nBCRA.   The  EEOC alleged  that the  requirements  of    90F that\n\nMassachusetts  state and  local employees  aged seventy  or older\n\ntake and pass  an annual  medical examination as  a condition  of\n\ncontinued employment was violative of,  and hence preempted by,  \n\n4(a)  of the  Age  Discrimination in  Employment  Act (ADEA),  29\n\nU.S.C.   623(a).  Section 4(a) provides: \n\n          It shall be  unlawful for  an employer (1)  to fail  or\n          refuse  to  hire  or  to discharge  any  individual  or\n          otherwise  discriminate  against  any  individual  with\n          respect  to  his  compensation,  terms,  conditions, or\n          privileges  of employment, because of such individual's\n          age; (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n          in any way which  would deprive or tend to  deprive any\n          individual  of  employment  opportunities or  otherwise\n          adversely affect his status  as an employee, because of\n          such individual's age; or (3)  to reduce the wage  rate\n          of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n            Following  discovery, all  parties moved  for summary\n\njudgment.    The  EEOC  argued  in  its  motion  that    90F  was\n\ndiscriminatory  on   its  face   and  that  defendants   had  not\n\nestablished  a  justification  for  using  age  as  a  factor  in\n\ndetermining  who would  be required  to take  and pass  a medical\n\nexamination   as    a   condition   of    continued   employment.\n\nMassachusetts'  answer in  its  motion for  summary judgment  was\n\ntwofold: first,  it  argued  that    4(a)  of the  ADEA  was  not\n\napplicable to the dispute because    90F was not preempted by the\n\nADEA; second, and in the alternative, Massachusetts argued that  \n\n90F did not violate the ADEA because concerns over the fitness of\n\nemployees, rather than age, was the basis of the statute.  \n\n          On   April  17,  1992,   the  district   court  granted\n\ndefendants'  motions for  summary  judgment, denying  the  EEOC's\n\nmotion.   The court reasoned that the regulation of its employees\n\nhas traditionally been one  of the historic powers of  the state.\n\nAccording  to the  court, the  Supreme Court  held in  Gregory v.\n                                                                 \n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the  view of the\n\ncourt, Congress, in enacting the ADEA, did not make  it clear and\n\nmanifest that  it intended to \"limit  employer-states' ability to\n\nassess  the fitness  of their  employees.\"   Moreover, the  court\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\ncontinued, the  practice of requiring employees  seventy years of\n\nage  or  older to  undergo an  annual  medical examination  \"is a\n\npractice very conducive  to the  health and well  being of  those\n\nemployed by state  government as  well as by  society at  large.\"\n\nThus, the  court concluded,   90F is not preempted by, and is not\n\nviolative of, the ADEA, and for the court to hold otherwise would\n\nbe \"to indulge in judicial legislation to override the balance of\n\nfederal and state powers.\"\n\n          The  EEOC now  appeals  the district  court's grant  of\n\nsummary judgment.  The EEOC requests that we reverse the grant of\n\nsummary judgment  in  favor  of  appellees  and  that  we  remand\n\ndirecting the  district court  to enter  summary judgment  in its\n\nfavor.  The  EEOC makes three  main arguments in  support of  its\n\nappeal.  First,  the EEOC reiterates that   90F violates the ADEA\n\non  its  face.   Second,  the EEOC  maintains that  age,  and not\n\nconcerns over employee fitness, is the basis for   90F.  Finally,\n\nthe  EEOC argues that    90F does  not qualify for  the bona fide\n\nemployee benefit exception of the ADEA.  \n\n                               II.\n\n          Rule  56(c) of  the  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure\n\nprovides that  summary judgment  \"shall be rendered  forthwith if\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nadmissions on file,  together with the  affidavits, if any,  show\n\nthat there is no genuine  issue as to any material fact  and that\n\nthe moving party  is entitled to a judgment as  a matter of law.\"\n\nFed.

The facts  of this  case, as\n\nrecounted above,  are not in dispute.   So, we turn  first to the\n\nissue of whether   90F is preempted by the ADEA.\n\n                                A.\n\n            Congress has  the power to preempt  state legislation\n\nunder the  Supremacy Clause  of Article VI  of the  Constitution.\n\nFederal  preemption  law  recognizes  two  types  of  preemption,\n\nexpress  and implied.

Express preemption occurs  when Congress states\n\nin  the  text of  legislation that  it  intends to  preempt state\n\nlegislation in  the area.   In  the  absence of  such a  specific\n\nstatement,  a federal statute  may also preempt  by implication a\n\nstate statute.   The United  States Supreme Court  has identified\n\nthe circumstances under which such implied preemption may occur: \n\n          In the absence of explicit statutory language, however,\n          Congress implicitly may indicate  an intent to occupy a\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          given  field to  the exclusion  of state  law.   Such a\n          purpose may be inferred  where the pervasiveness of the\n          federal  regulation  precludes  supplementation by  the\n          States,  where the  federal  interest in  the field  is\n          sufficiently dominant,  or where the \"object  sought to\n          be  obtained by the  federal law  and the  character of\n          obligations  imposed  by  it  .  .  .  reveal  the same\n          purpose.\"     Finally,  even  where  Congress  has  not\n                                                                 \n          entirely displaced  state  regulation in  a  particular\n                                                                 \n          field,  state   law  is  pre-empted  when  it  actually\n                                                                 \n          conflicts with  federal law.   Such a conflict  will be\n                                     \n          found \"'when it is impossible to comply with both state\n          and  federal law, or where  the state law  stands as an\n          obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and\n          objectives of Congress.'\"\n\nSchneidewind, 485 U.S. at  299-300 (citations omitted)  (emphasis\n            \n\nadded).  \n\n          Before  the  district court  the  EEOC  argued, and  on\n\nappeal it reiterates, that    90F actually conflicts with    4(a)\n\ndue  to  the  impossibility  of  complying  with  both  statutes.\n\nSpecifically, the  EEOC maintains that, since  only employees who\n\nare seventy  years of age or  older are required to  take and are\n\nforced  to retire if they  fail an annual  medical examination,  \n\n90F  conflicts  with    4(a) of  the  ADEA providing  that  it is\n\nunlawful  for  an  employer \"to  discharge  .  .  . or  otherwise\n\ndiscriminate against any  individual with  respect to his  . .  .\n\nterms, conditions,  or privileges  of employment because  of such\n\nindividual's age.\" 29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1).   \n\n          The   district  court  rejected  the  EEOC's  argument,\n\nfinding  that in  ADEA cases,  Congress must  expressly state  an\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nintention in order  for courts to find federal preemption.    The\n\ncourt  determined  that  the  recent Supreme  Court  decision  in\n\nGregory  v.  Ashcroft had  changed  the  standards for  resolving\n                     \n\nconflicts  between local  and  federal  government, deferring  to\n\nstate  sovereignty.   According to  the court,  \"in an  effort to\n\npreserve our federal system of government, the Supreme  Court has\n\nindicated  that  Congress should  make  its  intention clear  and\n\nmanifest  if it  intends to  preempt the  historic powers  of the\n\nstates.\" quoting Gregory v.  Ashcroft, 111 S.Ct. at 2401.   Under\n                                     \n\nthis  new standard, the district court concluded that the ADEA is\n\nambiguous as to whether the statute was intended to apply to such\n\nstate legislation  as    90F: \"[I]t  appears ambiguous,  and even\n\nunlikely, that Congress intended to outlaw a method of assessment\n\nutilized  by a  state  government which  requires annual  medical\n\nexaminations for its employees at the age of seventy.\" \n\n          It is true that the Gregory Court was unwavering in its\n                                     \n\ndesire to protect state sovereignty and principles of federalism.\n\nId.  at 2399.   However, its reasoning and  holding were far more\n   \n\nnarrow  and limited  than the  broad and  sweeping interpretation\n\nmade  by the  district  court.   In  Gregory, the  United  States\n                                            \n\nSupreme  Court rendered a decision on  the effects of the ADEA on\n\nthe  Missouri Constitution which required mandatory retirement of\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\njudges.2  Mo.  Const. art. V,    26.  The relevant  clause of the\n\nADEA provided: \n\n          The term \"employee\" means an individual employed by any\n          employer  except that  the  term \"employee\"  shall  not\n          include  any person  elected  to public  office in  any\n          State  or political  subdivision  of any  State by  the\n          qualified voters thereof, or  any person chosen by such\n          officer to be on  such officer's personal staff,  or an\n          appointee on  the policy  making level or  an immediate\n          adviser   with  respect   to   the   exercise  of   the\n          constitutional or legal powers of the office. \n\n29 U.S.C.    630(f).   Due to  the method of  selection of  state\n\njudges in  Missouri, it was  unclear whether they  were employees\n\nwithin the meaning of   630(f).  \n\n          It was  ultimately the ambiguity of  the judges' status\n\nas employees or policymakers which the Court found fatal to their\n\ncapacity  to be protected by  the ADEA.   Because Missouri judges\n\n                       \n\n   2Three years before the Supreme Court decided Gregory, the\n                                                        \n   First Circuit adjudicated precisely the same issue.  EEOC v.\n                                                               \n   Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512379\"><a href=\"/opinion/512379/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1988).  In that case,\n                \n   the court had to determine the effect of the 1987 amendments\n   to the ADEA on a provision of the Massachusetts Constitution\n   which made age 70 the mandatory retirement age for all state\n   judges.  The court affirmed the district court's\n   determination that the Act did not override the state\n   constitutional provision, finding that the state's judges\n   fell within the policy-making exception to employees\n   protected by the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.   630(f).  The court even\n   relied on the same rationale of respect for principles of\n   sovereignty, as did the Court in Gregory: \"Without question,\n                                           \n   the tenure of state judges is a question of exceeding\n   importance to each state, and a question traditionally left\n   to be answered by each state.  Any federal encroachment on a\n   state's freedom of choice in this area, therefore, strikes\n   very close to the heart of state sovereignty.\"  EEOC, 858\n                                                       \n   F.2d at 54.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nwere subject to retention  elections, they could be  construed as\n\nelected  officials, thus excluded from the ADEA.  It was unclear,\n\nhowever, whether state  court judges were state  officials on the\n\n\"policy-making level.\"  The Gregory Court aptly held that,  where\n                                   \n\nprovisions  are  ambiguous and  state  sovereignty  is at  issue,\n                              \n\ncourts should  reason carefully when making  determinations as to\n\npreemption.  Gregory,   111  S.Ct.  at   2401.     \"Congressional\n                    \n\ninterference  with  this  decision  of the  people  of  Missouri,\n\ndefining  their constitutional  officers, would  upset  the usual\n\nconstitutional balance of  federal and  state powers.

The  Court  made it  clear that  its\n       \n\ndeference  arises not from  a disdain for  preemption doctrine in\n\nthe context of the ADEA, but rather because: \n\n          the  case concerns  a  state  constitutional  provision\n          through  which  the  people  of  Missouri  establish  a\n          qualification for those who sit  as their judges.  This\n                                                                 \n          provision goes beyond  an area traditionally  regulated\n                                                                 \n          by the States; it is a decision of the most fundamental\n                                                                 \n          sort  for a sovereign entity.  Through the structure of\n                                       \n          its government, and the character of those who exercise\n          government  authority,  a  State  defines  itself as  a\n          sovereign.  \n\nId. at 2400 (emphasis added).  \n   \n\n          Thus,  while  Gregory   refused  to   find  the   state\n                               \n\nConstitution preempted by the ADEA, the opinion was unequivocally\n\nclear in  the narrowness  of its  holding.  At  no point  did the\n\nCourt suggest that all state regulations of public employees  are\n\nquestions at the heart of state  sovereignty.  Nor did it suggest\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nthat  Gregory  would be  controlling  on  the federal  preemption\n             \n\ndoctrine where there was not any ambiguity in the language of the\n\nstatute.   The Court stated:  \"The ADEA plainly covers all  state\n\nemployees  except those excluded by one of the exceptions.  Where\n\nit is unambiguous that  an employee does  not fall within one  of\n\nthe exceptions, the Act states plainly and unequivocally that the\n\nemployee is included.\"  Id. at 2404.\n                           \n\n          The   district   court   erred,   not   only   in   its\n\ninterpretation as to the breadth of the Gregory holding, but also\n                                               \n\nin its  applicability to the  instant case.   Here, there  are no\n\nambiguities in  the terms or provisions of   90F that should give\n\nus  pause as to whether  those affected are  employees within the\n\nmeaning of   4(a).  The district court determined that the effect\n\nof  the 1986 congressional amendment to the ADEA on statutes such\n\nas  Massachusetts'  is  de  facto  ambiguous.    Such  reasoning,\n\nhowever, begs the  threshold question of preemption.

Significantly, the Court\n                                \n\nwrote:\n\n          Under the ADEA,  [] the  State may still,  at the  very\n          least,  assess  the fitness  of  its  game wardens  and\n          dismiss those  wardens whom  it reasonably finds  to be\n          unfit.   Put another way, the Act requires the State to\n          achieve its goals in  a more individualized and careful\n          manner than  would otherwise be  the case, but  it does\n          not  require the State  to abandon  those goals,  or to\n          abandon the public policy decisions underlying them.\n\nId. \n   \n          Similarly,  here Massachusetts  may  still  assess  the\n\nfitness  of its  employees and  dismiss  those employees  whom it\n\nreasonably  finds to  be unfit.   But it  must do  so \"in  a more\n\nindividualized and careful manner\"  than the scheme envisioned by\n\n   90F.   In other  words, Massachusetts  is not  being asked  to\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nabandon  the  public policy  of  determining the  fitness  of its\n\nemployees, just as  Wyoming was  not being asked  to abandon  the\n\npublic  policy of  determining the  physical preparedness  of its\n\ngame wardens.   Instead, pursuant  to the ADEA,  just as  Wyoming\n\ncould not  arbitrarily pick 55 years of age as the point at which\n\nto  measure  the  physical  preparedness  of  its  game  wardens,\n\nMassachusetts  may not arbitrarily set up seventy years of age as\n\nthe point at which to determine the fitness of its employees. \n\n          The Supreme Court concluded in EEOC v. Wyoming:\n                                                        \n\n          [Wyoming] remain[s] free under  the ADEA to continue to\n          do precisely  what  [it  is]  doing now,  if  [it]  can\n          demonstrate  that  age  is a  \"bona  fide  occupational\n          qualification\"  for the job of game warden. . ..  [T]he\n          state's discretion to  achieve its goals in  the way it\n          thinks best is not being overridden entirely, but it is\n          merely   being  tested  against  a  reasonable  federal\n          standard.\n\nId. at 240.  Here, Massachusetts' discretion to achieve its goals\n   \n\nof determining  the  fitness of  its  employees is  being  tested\n\nagainst a reasonable federal standard.  And, in the absence of an\n\naffirmative defense,  we must conclude that  compliance with both\n\nthe  state  and federal  statutes  is  a physical  impossibility,\n\nmeaning that the ADEA must preempt the Massachusetts law.\n\n          The two  statutes are  also in actual  conflict because\n\nenforcement of the Massachusetts law creates an  obstacle for the\n\nimplementation  of the goals of  the ADEA.   Congress enacted the\n\nADEA  to   prevent   the  arbitrary   and  socially   destructive\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\ndiscrimination  on  the  basis of  age.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1985).   The United  States Supreme\n\nCourt has explained  that the  ADEA is of  particular force  when\n\nmandatory  retirement is at issue, as it  is here.  Criswell, 472\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  410.   In  the words  of the  Court, \"[t]he  legislative\n\nhistory of the 1978 Amendments to the ADEA makes quite clear that\n\nthe  policies and  substantive provisions  of the Act  apply with\n\nespecial force  in the case of  mandatory retirement provisions.\"\n\nId.  Moreover, \"[t]hroughout the legislative history of the ADEA,\n   \n\none  empirical  fact is  repeatedly  emphasized:  the process  of\n\npsychological  and physiological  degeneration  caused  by  aging\n\nvaries with  each individual.\"  Id. at 409.   Thus, the  ADEA was\n                                   \n\nenacted in  large part to  prevent mandatory retirement  based on\n\n\"innocent\" misperceptions as to the abilities of older employees,\n\nas well as more insidious \"business\" judgments as to their cost. \n\n          Here, the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts allows  age to\n\nbe the determinant as to when an employee's deterioration will be\n\nso  significant  that it  requires  special  treatment.   Such  a\n\nconception  of and  use  of age  as  a criteria  for decline  and\n\nunfitness for employment strikes at  the heart of the ADEA.   The\n\nentire  point of  the statute  is to  force employers  to abandon\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\nprevious stereotypes about the  abilities and capacities of older\n\nworkers.  Employers may  still regulate and condition employment,\n\nbut they may no longer immediately  turn to age as a  convenient,\n\nsimple criterion.  They must be prepared  to justify their use of\n\nage rather than individualized factors.    \n\n          In finding that  the ADEA  did not preempt    90F,  the\n\ndistrict  court reasoned that    90F is  \"an Act  relating to the\n\nqualifications  of  state  employees  which  was  lawful  and  an\n\neminently  reasonable expression  of state  power  when enacted.\"\n\nThus, the Court concluded, to hold   90F as preempted by the ADEA\n\nwould  be \"to  indulge in  judicial  legislation to  override the\n\nbalance  of federal  and  state powers.\"    No one  disputes  the\n\nproposition  that  the  historic  functions  of   regulating  the\n\nrelationship  between the  public  employer and  public employees\n\nhave traditionally been  left to the states.  But  it is also far\n\ntoo  late in  the day to  argue that  Congress does  not have the\n\npower to  require states  to regulate the  public employer\\public\n\nemployee relationship in a non-discriminatory fashion. 4  \n\n          Because the district court  rested its grant of summary\n\njudgment  for  the defendants  solely  on  its interpretation  of\n\n                       \n\n   4Case law supports the application of other federal anti-\n   discrimination statutes to state employment relationships. \n   See EEOC v.

They argue  that in  interpreting    90F,  our focus\n\nshould be not on the age requirement which triggers the condition\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\nof  continuing  employment,   but  rather,  on   the  examination\n\nrequirement  itself.

Manhart  involved  a  policy  of   the  Los  Angeles\n                    \n\nDepartment of Water and Power requiring larger contributions from\n\nwomen  than men to the Department's pension fund because women as\n\na group live longer than do men as  a group.  A class made up  of\n\nwomen employed or formerly  employed by the department challenged\n\nthe policy as a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964.  Plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  contribution  differential\n\nconstituted  discrimination on the basis of  sex.  The Department\n\nanswered that sex was not the factor on which the distinction was\n\nbeing  drawn;  it  was  longevity.    The   Court  rejected  this\n\ncontention,  holding that but for  their sex, women  would not be\n\nrequired  to pay more for  their retirement benefits.   The Court\n\nacknowledged that as a class women  tend to live longer than men.\n\nManhart,  435 U.S. at 707.  But the  Court found it to be equally\n       \n\ntrue  that all individuals in the respective classes do not share\n\nthe   characteristics  that   differentiate  the   average  class\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\nrepresentatives.  Id. at 708.  Thus, the Court reasoned that even\n                     \n\nwhere  characteristics  may  be class-based,  Title  VII requires\n\nfairness to individuals rather than to classes. Id.   In response\n                                                   \n\nto  the   Department's  specific  argument  that   the  different\n\ncontributions exacted from men and women were based on the factor\n\nof longevity rather than sex, the Court wrote: \n\n          It is plain [] that any individual's life expectancy is\n          based on a number of factors, of which sex is only one.\n          The record  contains no evidence that  any factor other\n          than  the  employee's sex  was  taken  into account  in\n          calculating the []  differential between the respective\n          contributions by men  and women. . ..  [O]ne cannot say\n          that an actuarial distinction  based entirely on sex is\n          \"based  on any other factor  than sex.   Sex is exactly\n          what it is based on.\"\n\nId.\n   \n\n          Similarly,  here appellees  argue that  the requirement\n\nthat  employees aged  seventy  or older  pass  an annual  medical\n\nexamination is based  on fitness rather  than age.   But, as  the\n\nSupreme  Court found in Manhart, it is clear that an individual's\n                               \n\nfitness to work is based on a number of factors,  of which age is\n\nonly  one.  And,  as in Manhart, the  record contains no evidence\n                               \n\nthat  any factor  other than  the employee's  age was  taken into\n\naccount  in requiring an annual medical examination.  Thus, as in\n\nManhart, we are forced to conclude that age is exactly what   90F\n       \n\nis  based on.   The reasonable  factor other than  age defense is\n\nsimply not applicable to   90F. \n\n                               -21-\n                                21\n\n           Appellees  argue  that   Manhart  gave  only   cursory\n                                           \n\ntreatment  to this issue and that because it predated Gregory, it\n                                                             \n\nhas less weight.  Both assertions  are incorrect.  As an  initial\n\nmatter,  Manhart   is  clear   in  holding  that   the  sex-based\n                \n\ndifferentiation in question   could not be  justified.  Moreover,\n\nin  Gregory  the  reasonable  factor defense  was  never  raised.\n           \n\nFinally,  while Manhart does arise out of  Title VII  and not out\n                       \n\nof the ADEA,   the First Circuit, like the  United States Supreme\n\nCourt, has made clear that the  ADEA tracks the law of Title VII.\n\nThurston, 469 U.S.  at 121; Rivas  v.

The plan envisioned in   90F\n\nfacially violates the qualification that the plan may not require\n\nor  permit involuntary  retirement.   The  United States  Supreme\n\nCourt  in Betts  concluded that  in order  for a benefit  plan to\n               \n\nqualify  for the   4(f)(2) exemption, it  must not be a method of\n\ndiscriminating  in  the  \"nonfringe\" aspects  of  the  employment\n\nrelationship.  Betts, 492 U.S. at 177.  The Court elaborated that\n                    \n\n   4(a)(1) and    4(f)(2) could  both be  given effect  only if  \n\n                               -24-\n                                24\n\n4(f)(2)  exempts bona  fide  plans  that  are  not  a  method  of\n\ndiscriminating in other  nonfringe benefit areas.

Although  the  Court  remanded   the  case  for\n\nresolution of  this issue,  it held:  \"As  a result  of the  1978\n\namendments,   4(f)(2) cannot be used to justify forced retirement\n\non account  of age.\"  Betts, 492 U.S.  at 166 n.2.

It  regulates not  \"fringe\n\nbenefits,\" but  the heart of the  employment relationship itself.\n\nSection  90F clearly  forces retirement  in precisely  the manner\n\n                               -25-\n                                25\n\nwhich the Supreme Court  explicitly found to be beyond  the scope\n\nof the exemption.5\n\n                               IV.\n\n           In conclusion, we hold that   90F is violative of, and\n\nis  preempted by, the ADEA  because it stands  in direct conflict\n\nwith    4(a)  of the  ADEA.   Specifically,  Massachusetts cannot\n\ncomply   with  the   ADEA  prohibition   that  no   employer  may\n\ndiscriminate against  any individual because of  age with respect\n\nto compensation,  terms, conditions or privileges  of employment,\n\nwhile at the same  time requiring employees seventy years  of age\n\nor older to pass an annual  medical examination as a condition of\n\ncontinued employment pursuant to   90F.  We also hold  that   90F\n\nis not exempt from the requirements  of the ADEA based on  either\n\nof the two  exemptions provided in   4(f)(1) or    4(f)(2) of the\n\nADEA.  Under    4(f)(1),  we cannot  rationally conclude that the\n\ndistinction among employees for the purpose of implementing   90F\n\nis  based on  any reasonable  factor other  than age.     Under  \n\n4(f)(2),  we cannot rationally find that   90F satisfies the bona\n\nfide employee  benefit plan exemption.   In order for   a plan to\n\n                       \n\n   5As is argued in the amicus brief, \"Since   90F permits . .\n                                                          \n   . only those employees age seventy and older who pass the\n   annual examination to continue employment, the only\n   conclusion to be drawn is that those who do not pass the\n   examination are not permitted to continue employment.\"\n                      \n\n                               -26-\n                                26\n\nqualify  under this exception, there may not be a provision which\n\nrequires  mandatory retirement.    Mandatory  retirement  is,  of\n\ncourse, the point of   90F.  \n\n           For the  foregoing reasons, we will  reverse the order\n\nof   the  district   granting  summary   judgment  in   favor  of\n\nMassachusetts  and the BCRA, and  we will remand  to the district\n\ncourt  for entry of  summary judgment  in favor  of EEOC  and for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nReversed and Remanded. \n                      \n\n                               -27-\n                                27\n</pre>",
