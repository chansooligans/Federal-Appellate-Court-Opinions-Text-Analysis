Plaintiff  appellant challenges  the\n                    \n\ndismissal of his First Amended Complaint for failure to state\n\na claim,1  denial of his  motion for  leave to file  a Second\n\nAmended Complaint, and the award of attorneys' fees and costs\n\nto defendant Virginia Brierly.\n\n          Although  plaintiff appears  here  pro  se, he  was\n                                                    \n\nrepresented by  counsel below.  His  First Amended Complaint,\n\nstyled as an action for damages and equitable relief under 42\n\nU.S.C.    1983,  named  as defendants  his ex-wife,  Virginia\n\nBrierly,  and  the  Acting Director  of  the  State of  Rhode\n\nIsland's Department of Human Services [\"DHS\"], Robert Fallon.\n\n          Plaintiff's pleadings are  difficult to recap  with\n\nprecision.  We set out here the core facts distilled from the\n\nFirst Amended  Complaint.  Count One  appears directed solely\n\nat  Virginia Brierly.  It recites that after his divorce from\n\nVirginia  Brierly in  1981,  plaintiff failed  to make  child\n\nsupport payments  in accordance with  the terms of  the Rhode\n\nIsland Family Court's decree.  In  March, 1986, plaintiff was\n\n                    \n\n1.  Both defendants  filed motions to dismiss.   Although one\nof the  motions was couched as  a motion for  judgment on the\npleadings under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 12(c), it  in essence  also\nraised  a Rule  12(b)(6) objection  by challenging  the legal\nfoundation  for the complaint.  It was properly dealt with on\nthis  basis  by  the  district  court.    See   Amersbach  v.\n                                                         \nCleveland, 598 F.2d 1033 (6th Cir. 1979), cited with approval\n                                                             \nin Whiting v. Maiolini,  921 F.2d 5 (1st Cir.  1990); Charles\n                      \nA. Wright et. al.,  5A Federal Practice and Procedure    1369\n                                                     \nat n.6 (2d ed. Supp. 1992).\n\npersonally served with notice of a motion brought by Virginia\n\nBrierly  to  adjudge him  in contempt.    The hearing  on the\n\nmotion   was  continued  beyond  its  first  scheduled  date.\n\nAllegedly due to Virginia  Brierly's \"failure to properly and\n\nlawfully serve  any kind of  notice [of  the continued  date]\n\nupon plaintiff,\"  plaintiff was  absent when the  hearing was\n\neventually  held  on  September  30,  1986.    As  a  result,\n\nplaintiff states,  he was adjudged in contempt for failure to\n\npay some  $58,640 in arrearages.   Also allegedly unbeknownst\n\nto plaintiff, a bench warrant issued for his arrest, pursuant\n\nto which  he was arrested  in February,  1988.   He was  then\n\nrequired to execute  a deed  in blank to  the former  marital\n\nresidence  to  secure  his  release.     He  states  that  he\n\npetitioned  for  review  of  the contempt  order,  apparently\n\nwithout  success, and  appealed to  the Rhode  Island Supreme\n\nCourt, which  \"after hearing, argument,  and presentation  of\n\nbriefs\" refused to grant  a writ of certiorari in  September,\n\n1990.  \n\n          Count Two appears directed  solely at Robert Fallon\n\nin  his capacity as Acting  Director of the  DHS.  It alleges\n\nthat DHS announced  an amnesty program \"whereby  arrangements\n\nfor the  payment of  child support  arrearages could  be made\n\nwithout  fear of  arrest  or interest  payments.\"   Plaintiff\n\nsought, through counsel, to take advantage of this program by\n\n                             -3-\n\nopening negotiations with  DHS toward establishing a  payment\n\nschedule  and other  terms.   The  amnesty period  terminated\n\nwhile  plaintiff  was  awaiting  a response  from  DHS  about\n\ncertain terms,2 but DHS  allegedly represented that it \"would\n\nhonor the terms of  the amnesty\" until a final  agreement had\n\nbeen reached.  Nevertheless, plaintiff says that DHS filed an\n\n\"unlawful petition\" causing his  arrest and incarceration for\n\nseven  days  in  September,  1991.    He was  allegedly  then\n\nrequired  to  execute  a promissory  note  in  the  amount of\n\n$58,640.00,  and  was found  liable by  the Family  Court for\n\nadditional  interest  on  arrearages.    He  states  that  he\n\nobjected on the  basis of DHS's alleged  amnesty promise, but\n\nthe Family Court failed to \"recognize\" the amnesty program.\n\n          Our standard on review  of dismissal of a complaint\n\nunder Rule  12(b)(6) is whether, construing  the complaint in\n\nthe  light  most favorable  to  the  plaintiff, dismissal  is\n\nappropriate  because  \"it  appears  beyond  doubt  that   the\n\nplaintiff can prove  no set of facts in  support of his claim\n\nwhich  would entitle him to relief.\"  Roeder v. Alpha Indus.,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  814 F.2d  22, 25  (1st Cir.  1987) (quoting  Conley v.\n                                                          \n\nGibson,  355 U.S.  41,  45-46 (1957));  see  also Finnern  v.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  amnesty time  period is not  mentioned in  the First\nAmended  Complaint, but for the sake of clarity, we note that\nthe proposed Second Amended Complaint states that the program\nwas  announced in April, 1990  and ran through  May 25, 1990,\nwhile plaintiff's appeal from his first contempt citation was\npending.   The authority  for, and mechanics  of, the amnesty\nprogram are not disclosed in the pleadings.\n\n                             -4-\n\nSunday  River Skiway Corp., 984 F.2d 530, 537 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                          \n\n(\"If a trial court accepts plaintiff's facts and can envision\n\nno  reasonable  application of  the  law  that would  entitle\n\nplaintiff  to  relief,  the  court may  rightly  dismiss  the\n\ncase.\").\n\n          The Supreme  Court recently reaffirmed  the Federal\n\nRules' \"liberal system  of notice pleading\" in a civil rights\n\naction brought under 42 U.S.C.   1983 against a municipality.\n\nLeatherman  v.   Tarrant  County  Narcotics   Intelligence  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nCoordination  Unit, 61  U.S.L.W.  4205 (U.S.  Mar. 3,  1993).\n                  \n\nHowever,   \"minimal  requirements   are  not   tantamount  to\n\nnonexistent requirements.\"   Gooley  v. Mobil Oil  Corp., 851\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir.  1988).  The court need  not \"conjure\n\nup unpled allegations or contrive elaborately arcane scripts\"\n\nin  order to craft a cognizable legal theory where none seems\n\nto exist.  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 514.  \n                 \n\n         Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is  deficient in\n\nnumerous ways, most of which were well described by the trial\n\njudge.   In line with his rulings, we interpret the complaint\n\nas asserting that each defendant's separate conduct reflected\n\na  deviation  from  an  established  state  rule,  policy  or\n\nstatute.   It may well be,  as the district court  held, that\n\nthe claim  asserted  against defendant  Virginia  Brierly  is\n\ninfirm  because  it  does   not  charge  any  conduct  fairly\n\nattributable to the State.   Lugar v. Edmondson Oil  Co., 457\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n\nU.S.  922,  937, 940  (1982).   Likewise,  the  damages claim\n\nasserted against the  defendant Fallon may well be  barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment, which proscribes suits against  State\n\nofficials  which must  be paid  from State  funds.   Hafer v.\n                                                          \n\nMelo, 112 S. Ct. 358, 362  (1991); Will v. Michigan Dep't  of\n                                                             \n\nState  Police,  491 U.S.  58,  65 (1989).   But  we  think it\n             \n\nunnecessary here  to reach  these issues because  both claims\n\nare infirm for another reason:  there are no facts indicating\n\nthat the remedies available from the State were inadequate. \n\n          It  is well  established that  unauthorized conduct\n\nwhich cannot be  foreseen and controlled in advance  does not\n\nconstitute a violation of  the procedural requirements of the\n\nDue Process  Clause \"until and unless [the  State] refuses to\n\nprovide  a  suitable  postdeprivation  remedy.\"    Hudson  v.\n                                                         \n\nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984); see also Parratt v. Taylor,\n                                                            \n\n451 U.S. 527  (1981); Zinermon  v. Burch, 494  U.S. 113,  125\n                                        \n\n(1990); Lowe v. Scott,  959 F.2d 323 (1st Cir. 1992).   Since\n                     \n\ninadequacy of the state's remedy is a material element of the\n\nclaim,  plaintiff  had the  burden  to  set forth  supporting\n\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, to sustain\n\nan actionable legal theory.  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 515.\n                                   \n\n     Plaintiff's  vague  allegations  reflect, instead,  that\n\nthere was a state process for challenging both of the alleged\n\ndue process deprivations.  Plaintiff even states that he used\n\nthe  process, appealing at least one of his objections as far\n\n                             -6-\n\nas the Rhode Island Supreme Court.   That plaintiff disagreed\n\nwith  the result  does not  show that  the process  itself is\n\ninadequate.   To the extent  that plaintiff is  attempting by\n\nthis  suit to overturn those state court judgments, he is not\n\nentitled to any  relief in the district court or here.  Lower\n\nfederal courts have no power to sit  in review of state court\n\norders.  District  of Columbia Court  of Appeals v.  Feldman,\n                                                            \n\n460 U.S. 462, 476  (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust  Co., 263\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 413 (1923);  Lancellotti v.  Fay, 909 F.2d  15, 17  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1990).     \n\n          We  also see no  reason to disagree  with the trial\n\ncourt's  decisions  to  grant Virginia  Brierly's  motion for\n\nattorney's  fees and  costs, and  to deny  plaintiff's second\n\nmotion to amend the complaint.   Both decisions are entrusted\n\nto the sound discretion of the district court,  whose rulings\n\nwill not be  disturbed except  on a clear  showing of  abuse.\n\nSee  Coyne v. Somerville, 972  F.2d 440, 446  (1st Cir. 1992)\n                        \n\n(denial of motion to amend); Finnern, 984 F.2d at 537 (same);\n                                    \n\nChristiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434  U.S. 412 (1978) (fee\n                                  \n\nawards under 42 U.S.C.    1988); Lancellotti, 909 F.2d  at 15\n                                            \n\n(sanctions under Rule 11). \n\n          The  district  court  awarded  costs  and  fees  to\n\nVirginia Brierly when it dismissed the claim asserted against\n\nher in  plaintiff's First Amended  Complaint.  The  order ran\n\njointly against plaintiff and his attorney under Rule 11, and\n\n                             -7-\n\nagainst  plaintiff alone under 42  U.S.C.   1988.   The court\n\npointedly found that plaintiff's purpose in bringing the suit\n\nincluded  an  effort  to   harass  Virginia  Brierly  and  to\n\nretaliate against  her for the losses  plaintiff had suffered\n\nin the state courts.   Moreover, the court reasoned  that the\n\nclaim  as pleaded was so frivolous  and lacking in foundation\n\nthat neither a  competent attorney nor a party could believe,\n\nafter a reasonable inquiry, that it was well-grounded in fact\n\nor in law.\n\n          These findings more than satisfied the requirements\n\nof Rule 11 and 42 U.S.C.    1988, which, though not identical\n\nto one another,  permit fee awards either  where the pleading\n\nfalls below an objective  standard of reasonableness or where\n                                                       \n\nthere  is a  showing  of subjective  bad  faith.   Here  both\n\nstandards were violated.  See Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S.  5, 14\n                                            \n\n(1980)  (applying  the criteria  announced  in Christiansburg\n                                                             \n\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421-22 (1978) to awards of\n                   \n\nfees  to  prevailing  defendants  under 42  U.S.C.     1988);\n\nLancellotti,  909  F.2d  at  19  (observing  the  alternative\n           \n\nstandards for Rule 11 awards); Foster v.

His  First Amended Complaint,\n\nstyled as an action for damages and equitable relief under 42\n\nU.S.C.    1983,  named  as defendants  his ex-wife,  Virginia\n\nBrierly,  and  the  Acting Director  of  the  State of  Rhode\n\nIsland's Department of Human Services [\"DHS\"], Robert Fallon.\n\n          Plaintiff's pleadings are  difficult to recap  with\n\nprecision.  We set out here the core facts distilled from the\n\nFirst Amended  Complaint.  Count One  appears directed solely\n\nat  Virginia Brierly.  It recites that after his divorce from\n\nVirginia  Brierly in  1981,  plaintiff failed  to make  child\n\nsupport payments  in accordance with  the terms of  the Rhode\n\nIsland Family Court's decree.  In  March, 1986, plaintiff was\n\n                    \n\n1.  Both defendants  filed motions to dismiss.   Although one\nof the  motions was couched as  a motion for  judgment on the\npleadings under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 12(c), it  in essence  also\nraised  a Rule  12(b)(6) objection  by challenging  the legal\nfoundation  for the complaint.  It was properly dealt with on\nthis  basis  by  the  district  court.    See   Amersbach  v.\n                                                         \nCleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366341\"><a href=\"/opinion/366341/joseph-c-amersbach-jr-v-city-of-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1979), cited with approval\n                                                             \nin Whiting v.

The hearing  on the\n\nmotion   was  continued  beyond  its  first  scheduled  date.\n\nAllegedly due to Virginia  Brierly's \"failure to properly and\n\nlawfully serve  any kind of  notice [of  the continued  date]\n\nupon plaintiff,\"  plaintiff was  absent when the  hearing was\n\neventually  held  on  September  30,  1986.    As  a  result,\n\nplaintiff states,  he was adjudged in contempt for failure to\n\npay some  $58,640 in arrearages.   Also allegedly unbeknownst\n\nto plaintiff, a bench warrant issued for his arrest, pursuant\n\nto which  he was arrested  in February,  1988.   He was  then\n\nrequired to execute  a deed  in blank to  the former  marital\n\nresidence  to  secure  his  release.     He  states  that  he\n\npetitioned  for  review  of  the contempt  order,  apparently\n\nwithout  success, and  appealed to  the Rhode  Island Supreme\n\nCourt, which  \"after hearing, argument,  and presentation  of\n\nbriefs\" refused to grant  a writ of certiorari in  September,\n\n1990.  \n\n          Count Two appears directed  solely at Robert Fallon\n\nin  his capacity as Acting  Director of the  DHS.  It alleges\n\nthat DHS announced  an amnesty program \"whereby  arrangements\n\nfor the  payment of  child support  arrearages could  be made\n\nwithout  fear of  arrest  or interest  payments.\"   Plaintiff\n\nsought, through counsel, to take advantage of this program by\n\n                             -3-\n\nopening negotiations with  DHS toward establishing a  payment\n\nschedule  and other  terms.   The  amnesty period  terminated\n\nwhile  plaintiff  was  awaiting  a response  from  DHS  about\n\ncertain terms,2 but DHS  allegedly represented that it \"would\n\nhonor the terms of  the amnesty\" until a final  agreement had\n\nbeen reached.  Nevertheless, plaintiff says that DHS filed an\n\n\"unlawful petition\" causing his  arrest and incarceration for\n\nseven  days  in  September,  1991.    He was  allegedly  then\n\nrequired  to  execute  a promissory  note  in  the  amount of\n\n$58,640.00,  and  was found  liable by  the Family  Court for\n\nadditional  interest  on  arrearages.    He  states  that  he\n\nobjected on the  basis of DHS's alleged  amnesty promise, but\n\nthe Family Court failed to \"recognize\" the amnesty program.\n\n          Our standard on review  of dismissal of a complaint\n\nunder Rule  12(b)(6) is whether, construing  the complaint in\n\nthe  light  most favorable  to  the  plaintiff, dismissal  is\n\nappropriate  because  \"it  appears  beyond  doubt  that   the\n\nplaintiff can prove  no set of facts in  support of his claim\n\nwhich  would entitle him to relief.\"  Roeder v.

In line with his rulings, we interpret the complaint\n\nas asserting that each defendant's separate conduct reflected\n\na  deviation  from  an  established  state  rule,  policy  or\n\nstatute.   It may well be,  as the district court  held, that\n\nthe claim  asserted  against defendant  Virginia  Brierly  is\n\ninfirm  because  it  does   not  charge  any  conduct  fairly\n\nattributable to the State.

Since\n                     \n\ninadequacy of the state's remedy is a material element of the\n\nclaim,  plaintiff  had the  burden  to  set forth  supporting\n\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, to sustain\n\nan actionable legal theory.
