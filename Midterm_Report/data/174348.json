Farrukh    Ghouri,   of   Pakistan,\n\npetitions for review of a November 30, 2009 decision by the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA).         The BIA upheld a February 25, 2008\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) decision denying Ghouri's applications for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).      A Shia Muslim, Ghouri claims that he fears\n\nhis brother-in-law will murder him and his wife in an honor killing\n\nbecause his wife converted from Sunni to Shia Islam when she\n\nmarried Ghouri.    We are without jurisdiction to review the denial\n\nof the untimely claim of asylum. Substantial evidence supports the\n\ndetermination     that   Ghouri   failed       to     show   eligibility   for\n\nwithholding of removal or CAT protection.             We deny the petition in\n\npart and dismiss it in part.\n\n                                      I.\n\n          Ghouri entered the United States on March 14, 2001, on a\n\ntemporary visitor visa and overstayed.                On March 19, 2003, the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear charging\n\nhim with removability, which Ghouri conceded.                On July 15, 2004,\n\nGhouri filed for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.     His asylum application was outside the one-year\n\nstatutory deadline. See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(B).\n\n          Ghouri's application gave three grounds for the relief he\n\nsought: his involvement in the Pakistan People's Party, threats and\n\nattacks by his brother-in-law because Ghouri is a Shia Muslim and\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fbecause of his wife's conversion to Shia Islam, and visits by the\n\npolice to Ghouri's family home for unspecified reasons.              In his\n\nbrief to this court, Ghouri presses only his claims based on his\n\nbrother-in-law's threats and actions, so we restrict our discussion\n\nto this ground.\n\n           The IJ found Ghouri's application and hearing testimony\n\ngenerally credible.        Ghouri married his wife, Saira, in Lahore,\n\nPakistan in February 1998.1          He was a Shia Muslim, and Saira\n\nconverted from Sunni to Shia Islam.          Saira's family had intended\n\nfor her to marry her cousin and was angry that she married a Shia\n\nand converted.      Her brother, Wajid Ali (Wajid), was particularly\n\nfurious.\n\n           Before the wedding, Wajid threatened to beat and to kill\n\nGhouri if he married Saira.           After the wedding, at a family\n\ngathering in April, 1998, Wajid again threatened to kill Ghouri,\n\nand at another family gathering that September, Wajid threatened to\n\nkill Ghouri and Saira.\n\n           During    the    three   years   between   Ghouri   and   Saira's\n\nmarriage and Ghouri's departure for the United States, Ghouri and\n\nSaira lived only a quarter mile from Wajid, and the two men passed\n\none another on their motorcycles \"all the time\" without incident.\n\n\n\n     1\n          There is no information in the record about the current\nstatus of Ghouri's wife and daughter except that they entered the\nUnited States on June 16, 2001, on temporary visitor visas, which\nthey have overstayed.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fWajid never came to their home.    While Ghouri's asylum application\n\nstated that Wajid had \"punched and hit\" him on three occasions at\n\nfamily gatherings, he testified that Wajid actually injured Ghouri\n\nonly once.\n\n          In that incident, Wajid punched Ghouri near his left eye.\n\nGhouri got two stitches in an emergency room.    Another time, Wajid\n\nthrew glass and rocks at Ghouri, and the third time, Ghouri escaped\n\nWajid's attempt to hit him without injury.        Each time, family\n\nmembers would restrain Wajid and take him away.      Wajid also hit\n\nSaira on the head and slapped her face at least once at a public\n\ngathering.   Ghouri never reported any of these incidents because\n\nthey were family matters.\n\n          Ghouri claimed that he could not move to another part of\n\nPakistan because members of Saira's large and wealthy family lived\n\nthroughout the country.\n\n          Ghouri   claimed   exceptional    circumstances   --   his\n\ndepression -- rendered him incapable of timely applying for asylum,\n\nand he submitted letters from his psychiatrist and family doctor\n\nsupporting this claim.    He said that he became depressed shortly\n\nafter arriving in the United States in 2001, though he did not seek\n\ntreatment for depression until 2006.\n\n          The IJ rejected Ghouri's claim that depression prevented\n\nhim from timely filing for asylum, finding the psychiatrist's\n\nretrospective depression diagnosis speculative, and concluding that\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fGhouri had not established extraordinary circumstances excusing his\n\nlate asylum application from the one-year time bar.                See 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n            The   IJ    found    Ghouri   ineligible      for    withholding    of\n\nremoval, on the grounds that (1) he had not established past\n\npersecution, both because Wajid's death threats were not credible\n\nand because the incidents in total did not rise to the level of\n\npersecution, (2) he had not established that it was more likely\n\nthan not that he would suffer future persecution because the\n\nevidence did not support a finding that Wajid would actually try to\n\nkill him, (3) Ghouri's failure to report any of the incidents to\n\nthe police prevented him from demonstrating government involvement\n\nin the alleged persecution, and (4) Ghouri could relocate within\n\nPakistan to avoid Wajid, who was the only person in Saira's family\n\nharassing Ghouri.\n\n            The IJ denied Ghouri's claims under the CAT because he\n\nhad not demonstrated that Wajid would more likely than not harm him\n\nin the future or that the Pakistani government or police would\n\ncondone or acquiesce in such harm.\n\n            The   BIA    affirmed,      agreeing   with    the    IJ   that    the\n\nstatements from Ghouri's doctors were speculative, and that based\n\non   the    record      Ghouri    had     not   established       extraordinary\n\ncircumstances excusing his asylum application from the one-year\n\ntime bar.   The BIA found no legal error in the IJ's rulings, and no\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fclear error in the IJ's underlying factual findings.                  The BIA\n\nspecifically affirmed that the incidents involving Wajid did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution and that Ghouri had not shown he\n\nwould more likely than not be persecuted in the future, given that\n\nWajid had lived near him for several years but had not seriously\n\nharmed him.    Finally, the BIA found that the record supported the\n\nIJ's denial of protection under the CAT.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Ghouri challenges the IJ and BIA's determinations that\n\nhis asylum application was untimely and that he was ineligible for\n\nwithholding of removal or CAT protection because he failed to\n\nestablish   past   persecution   or   a    well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution.    We reject each of his claims of error.2\n\nA.          Lack of Jurisdiction over Asylum Claim\n\n            Under 8 U.S.C ยง 1158(a)(3), this court lacks jurisdiction\n\nover an untimely asylum claim unless the applicant shows a legal or\n\nconstitutional defect in the agency's timeliness decision.             Makieh\n\nv. Holder, 572 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 2009); El-Labaki v. Mukasey,\n\n544 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008).            Ghouri has identified no such\n\ndefect, so we lack jurisdiction to hear this claim.\n\n            The only purported \"legal error\" Ghouri offers is based\n\non his incorrect assertion that the IJ and BIA wholly ignored his\n\n\n     2\n           Ghouri's argument that the IJ and BIA's carefully\nreasoned decisions are not clear enough to permit review is utterly\nmeritless.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fclaimed \"exceptional circumstance\" that he suffered from a mental\n\ndisability, depression.               Not so.      The IJ expressly addressed\n\nGhouri's claimed mental disability.                The BIA expressly agreed with\n\nthe IJ's finding that the physician letters were speculative, and\n\nthat Ghouri had failed to establish extraordinary circumstances.3\n\nWe cannot review these assessments.\n\nB.          Withholding of Removal and Protection under the CAT\n\n            When the BIA \"adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some\n\nof the bases for the IJ's decision,\" we review both the IJ's and\n\nBIA's opinions.         Makieh, 572 F.3d at 41 (quoting Scatambuli v.\n\nHolder, 558 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).        We    review    factual      findings   under    the    deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.                   Id.   We reverse only if any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach a contrary\n\nconclusion.      Id.\n\n            We    bypass        the   usual      recitations     about   the   legal\n\nrequirements the petitioner must meet and get to the merits.                     The\n\nconclusion that any harm Ghouri suffered did not rise to the level\n\nof persecution is well-supported in the record.                     Ghouri's brief\n\nidentifies three ways he suffered persecution at the hands of his\n\n\n\n     3\n          Ghouri makes much of the BIA's apparent misstatement that\nGhouri first sought medical attention for a heart condition, rather\nthan his depression, in 2006.         But this claim of factual\ndiscrepancy does not constitute a claim of legal error. See Ayeni\nv. Holder, No. 09-1508, 2010 WL 3220630, at *4 (1st Cir. Aug. 17,\n2010).\n\n                                           -7-\n\fbrother-in-law, Wajid: Wajid threatened Ghouri and his family,\n\ninjured or attempted to injure Ghouri in three incidents, and beat\n\nGhouri's wife.       This \"persecution\" came solely from Wajid.            It is\n\nclear that Wajid's family restrained Wajid when he acted in their\n\npresence.     Further, Wajid never attempted to harm Ghouri in his\n\nhome, he physically confronted Ghouri only rarely and only at large\n\ngatherings, and any harm he inflicted was minimal.\n\n             Ghouri claimed that Wajid punched him once in the face,\n\nthrew rocks and glass at him once, and once struck at but did not\n\ninjure him.4    As to Saira, the IJ found that Wajid slapped Saira in\n\nthe face and head at least once, though Ghouri claimed in his\n\nasylum application that Wajid hit her on several occasions.                     He\n\nnever claimed that she was seriously injured.\n\n             This    offensive      treatment   by   Ghouri's    brother-in-law\n\nsimply was not pervasive or severe enough to compel the BIA to find\n\nthat it amounted to persecution, even without comparing these facts\n\nto   other   cases    in    which   we   have   upheld   BIA    findings   of   no\n\npersecution.     And if a comparison is made, the conclusion becomes\n\neven more obvious.         See, e.g., Ravix v. Mukasey, 552 F.3d 42, 44-46\n\n(1st Cir. 2009); Limani v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n      4\n          Ghouri vehemently disputes the IJ's conclusion that,\nthough Ghouri mentioned three incidents in his asylum application,\nhis hearing testimony discussed only one incident.       The IJ's\nconclusion was supportable; further, even if there were three\nencounters, that would not compel a finding of persecution.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f          Ghouri argues the BIA's finding that he would not face\n\nfuture persecution fails because the BIA erroneously said he had\n\nlived close to Wajid without harm for five years, when, as the IJ\n\ncorrectly found, it was for three years. This discrepancy does not\n\nundermine the core reasoning of either the BIA or the IJ and\n\ncertainly does not compel a different conclusion.\n\n          It follows that Ghouri's claims for CAT relief also fail.\n\nSee Makalo v. Holder, No. 09-2034, 2010 WL 2802642, at *3 (1st Cir.\n\nJuly 19, 2010); Faye v. Holder, 580 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          The petition for review is denied as to the withholding\n\nof removal and CAT claims, and dismissed as to the asylum claim.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

See 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n            The   IJ    found    Ghouri   ineligible      for    withholding    of\n\nremoval, on the grounds that (1) he had not established past\n\npersecution, both because Wajid's death threats were not credible\n\nand because the incidents in total did not rise to the level of\n\npersecution, (2) he had not established that it was more likely\n\nthan not that he would suffer future persecution because the\n\nevidence did not support a finding that Wajid would actually try to\n\nkill him, (3) Ghouri's failure to report any of the incidents to\n\nthe police prevented him from demonstrating government involvement\n\nin the alleged persecution, and (4) Ghouri could relocate within\n\nPakistan to avoid Wajid, who was the only person in Saira's family\n\nharassing Ghouri.\n\n            The IJ denied Ghouri's claims under the CAT because he\n\nhad not demonstrated that Wajid would more likely than not harm him\n\nin the future or that the Pakistani government or police would\n\ncondone or acquiesce in such harm.\n\n            The   BIA    affirmed,      agreeing   with    the    IJ   that    the\n\nstatements from Ghouri's doctors were speculative, and that based\n\non   the    record      Ghouri    had     not   established       extraordinary\n\ncircumstances excusing his asylum application from the one-year\n\ntime bar.   The BIA found no legal error in the IJ's rulings, and no\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fclear error in the IJ's underlying factual findings.                  The BIA\n\nspecifically affirmed that the incidents involving Wajid did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution and that Ghouri had not shown he\n\nwould more likely than not be persecuted in the future, given that\n\nWajid had lived near him for several years but had not seriously\n\nharmed him.    Finally, the BIA found that the record supported the\n\nIJ's denial of protection under the CAT.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Ghouri challenges the IJ and BIA's determinations that\n\nhis asylum application was untimely and that he was ineligible for\n\nwithholding of removal or CAT protection because he failed to\n\nestablish   past   persecution   or   a    well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution.    We reject each of his claims of error.2\n\nA.          Lack of Jurisdiction over Asylum Claim\n\n            Under 8 U.S.C ยง 1158(a)(3), this court lacks jurisdiction\n\nover an untimely asylum claim unless the applicant shows a legal or\n\nconstitutional defect in the agency's timeliness decision.

Ghouri has identified no such\n\ndefect, so we lack jurisdiction to hear this claim.\n\n            The only purported \"legal error\" Ghouri offers is based\n\non his incorrect assertion that the IJ and BIA wholly ignored his\n\n\n     2\n           Ghouri's argument that the IJ and BIA's carefully\nreasoned decisions are not clear enough to permit review is utterly\nmeritless.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fclaimed \"exceptional circumstance\" that he suffered from a mental\n\ndisability, depression.               Not so.      The IJ expressly addressed\n\nGhouri's claimed mental disability.                The BIA expressly agreed with\n\nthe IJ's finding that the physician letters were speculative, and\n\nthat Ghouri had failed to establish extraordinary circumstances.3\n\nWe cannot review these assessments.\n\nB.          Withholding of Removal and Protection under the CAT\n\n            When the BIA \"adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some\n\nof the bases for the IJ's decision,\" we review both the IJ's and\n\nBIA's opinions.         Makieh, 572 F.3d at 41 (quoting Scatambuli v.\n\nHolder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355710\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355710/scatambuli-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).

The\n\nconclusion that any harm Ghouri suffered did not rise to the level\n\nof persecution is well-supported in the record.                     Ghouri's brief\n\nidentifies three ways he suffered persecution at the hands of his\n\n\n\n     3\n          Ghouri makes much of the BIA's apparent misstatement that\nGhouri first sought medical attention for a heart condition, rather\nthan his depression, in 2006.         But this claim of factual\ndiscrepancy does not constitute a claim of legal error. See Ayeni\nv.

This \"persecution\" came solely from Wajid.            It is\n\nclear that Wajid's family restrained Wajid when he acted in their\n\npresence.     Further, Wajid never attempted to harm Ghouri in his\n\nhome, he physically confronted Ghouri only rarely and only at large\n\ngatherings, and any harm he inflicted was minimal.\n\n             Ghouri claimed that Wajid punched him once in the face,\n\nthrew rocks and glass at him once, and once struck at but did not\n\ninjure him.4    As to Saira, the IJ found that Wajid slapped Saira in\n\nthe face and head at least once, though Ghouri claimed in his\n\nasylum application that Wajid hit her on several occasions.                     He\n\nnever claimed that she was seriously injured.\n\n             This    offensive      treatment   by   Ghouri's    brother-in-law\n\nsimply was not pervasive or severe enough to compel the BIA to find\n\nthat it amounted to persecution, even without comparing these facts\n\nto   other   cases    in    which   we   have   upheld   BIA    findings   of   no\n\npersecution.     And if a comparison is made, the conclusion becomes\n\neven more obvious.         See, e.g., Ravix v.

The IJ's\nconclusion was supportable; further, even if there were three\nencounters, that would not compel a finding of persecution.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f          Ghouri argues the BIA's finding that he would not face\n\nfuture persecution fails because the BIA erroneously said he had\n\nlived close to Wajid without harm for five years, when, as the IJ\n\ncorrectly found, it was for three years. This discrepancy does not\n\nundermine the core reasoning of either the BIA or the IJ and\n\ncertainly does not compel a different conclusion.\n\n          It follows that Ghouri's claims for CAT relief also fail.\n\nSee Makalo v.
