Velez-Rive, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                     Souter, Associate Justice,*\n                      and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Nicolás Nogueras Cartagena, with whom Maria Teresa Figueroa\nColón was on brief, for appellant.\n     Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General, with whom Leticia\nCasalduc-Rabell, Deputy Solicitor General, Susana I. Peñagarícano-\nBrown, Assistant Solicitor General, Carlos George-Iguina, and\nJoanna Matos Hicks, were on briefs, for the appellees.\n\n\n\n                          February 4, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             SOUTER, Associate Justice.          The plaintiff, Bethzaida\n\nCintrón-Lorenzo, alleges sexual harassment and discrimination by\n\nher employment supervisor, Orlando Aldebol-Borrero, at a Puerto\n\nRican government insurance fund, Fondo del Seguro del Estado, and\n\nshe has complained of this sexual misconduct in statutory and\n\nconstitutional claims against them and others over the course of\n\nnearly eight years.       This appeal challenges the district court’s\n\ndismissal of equal protection claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nand supplementary complaints under Puerto Rican statutes, the\n\nformer found to have been filed after the statute of limitations\n\nhad run.     We affirm.\n\n             On the face of the pleadings and documents before the\n\ntrial court, the § 1983 action is patently untimely.              The most\n\nrecent instance of allegedly forbidden action is said to have\n\noccurred on June 19, 2003 (identified in a 2003 administrative\n\ncomplaint of a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e et seq., filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission).     It is undisputed that the limitation period for an\n\nequal protection claim under § 1983 is borrowed from local law and\n\nis one year in Puerto Rico.       This action was not filed until July\n\n10, 2007.\n\n             Cintrón-Lorenzo contends that the running of the one-year\n\nstatute was tolled, first by filing her administrative complaint\n\nwith   the    EEOC,   then   by   filing    an   earlier   judicial   action\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\f(mentioning no § 1983 claim and eventually dismissed voluntarily\n\nwithout prejudice), an argument that all agree turns in part on the\n\nPuerto Rican tolling rule, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 § 5303 (Official\n\ntranslation 1990).1    Many pages of briefing address the question\n\nwhether the first judicial action stated non-§ 1983 causes of\n\naction similar enough to the later equal protection claim to toll\n\nthe running of the one-year statute under the Puerto Rican rule.\n\nSee, e.g., Cintrón v. E.L.A., 127 P.R. Dec. 582 (1990).     This issue\n\nis irrelevant, however, for the one-year period had run before the\n\nfirst judicial action was filed.\n\n           Although there are no translated cases from the Supreme\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico, and no cases from this circuit or from the\n\nSupreme Court determining whether filing a Title VII complaint with\n\nthe EEOC can affect the limitation period for a related § 1983\n\naction, cases addressing § 1981 have held the answer to be no.        See\n\nJohnson v. Ry Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 466 (1975); Leon-\n\nNogueras v. Univ. of P.R., 964 F. Supp. 585, 589 (D.P.R. 1997).\n\nBut even if we treat the issue as undecided, the Puerto Rican rule\n\nwould apparently, at best, reset the commencement of the one-year\n\nperiod at the date of filing the EEOC complaint; it would not\n\nsuspend the running of the period during pendency of the complaint\n\nbefore   the   EEOC.   Leon-Nogueras,   964   F.   Supp.   at   589   (an\n\n\n     1\n      \"Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution\nbefore the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by\nany act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fextrajudicial claim may serve to \"restart[] the running of the . .\n\n. statute of limitations\" on the § 1983     judicial claim, but it\n\ndoes not preserve the judicial claim \"in a state of suspended\n\nanimation\").    In this case the administrative complaint was filed\n\non July 10, 2003; the first judicial complaint was filed over one\n\nyear later, on August 13, 2004. Thus, giving Cintrón-Lorenzo every\n\npossible indulgence, the § 1983 limitation period had expired\n\nbefore she entered federal court the first time.\n\n            As to the local statutory actions, even if timely, the\n\ndistrict court was of course acting with reasonable discretion to\n\ndismiss them without prejudice once the federal claim was out of\n\nthe case.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 4 -\n\f",
