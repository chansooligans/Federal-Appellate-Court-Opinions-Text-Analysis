Appellant Subir  Chaklader was ordered\n                    \n\nby the district  court to serve a previously  suspended five-\n\nyear sentence for  violating the conditions of  his parole by\n\ncommitting  an assault  and battery with  a deadly  weapon in\n\nCalifornia.  On appeal, Chaklader argues that the twenty-one-\n\nmonth delay between the time that California prison officials\n\nfirst indicated that  he would be  made available to  federal\n\nauthorities  on a  detainer and  the commencement  of federal\n\nprobation  revocation proceedings, violated  Rule 32.1 of the\n\nFederal  Rules  of Criminal  Procedure  and  the due  process\n\nclause of the United States Constitution.\n\n                         BACKGROUND1\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n          Chaklader was  federally indicted  in 1983  for one\n\ncount  of mail  fraud and  one count  of using  fraudulently-\n\nobtained  credit cards.   In  1987, he  was sentenced  in the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for   the  District   of\n\nMassachusetts to  a three-year committed sentence  on Count 1\n\nand a consecutive five-year suspended sentence with probation\n\n                    \n\n1.  Some  of  the facts  mentioned  below are  found  only in\nappendices  filed  for the  first  time  with this  court  by\nChaklader and the government after appeal.  They are not part\nof  the district  court  record, Chaklader  having failed  to\nraise his  Rule 32.1  and due  process  arguments before  the\ndistrict  court.   While facts  not contained  in the  record\nbelow are not properly before this  court, we nonetheless set\nforth  the parties' version of  them by way  of background to\nour conclusion that,  even considering the Rule 32.1  and due\nprocess arguments, they are wholly without merit.  \n\n                             -2-\n\nfor  five years on Count  2.  Chaklader  served the committed\n\nsentence and was released on probation in 1988.\n\n          On  May   7,  1990,  Chaklader   was  arrested   in\n\nCalifornia and charged under state law with attempted murder.\n\nOn May 9 and May  14 of that year, the United  States Marshal\n\nin  California  filed  detainers   against  Chaklader  for  a\n\nprobation   violation   warrant   the   district   judge   in\n\nMassachusetts had ordered  several days before the  offense.2\n\nThese  detainers  sought  notification  from  the  California\n\nprison  authorities if  Chaklader was  transferred, available\n\nfor federal custody, or released from state custody.  \n\n          On  June 27,  1990,  Chaklader pled  guilty in  the\n\nCalifornia Superior Court to the lesser charge of assault and\n\nbattery with a  deadly weapon and was sentenced to  a term of\n\nfour-years imprisonment that  \"may run  concurrent\" with  any\n\nfederal sentence.  Over the next two years, while serving his\n\nstate sentence  in  a state  prison, Chaklader  says that  he\n\nsought  unsuccessfully  to   have  federal  authorities  take\n\n                    \n\n2.  This petition  for revocation of probation,  dated May 4,\n1990,  identified five  separate probation  violations:   (1)\nfailure  to notify  his probation  officer  that he  had been\nquestioned by law enforcement officers; (2) failure to notify\nhis probation  officer that he  had been discharged  from his\nemployment;  (3) leaving  the Southern  District of  New York\nwithout permission of  the Probation Department;  (4) failure\nto notify his probation officer of a change in residence; and\n(5) failure to  report to his probation  officer as directed.\nAn   additional   probation   revocation  petition   alleging\nChaklader's conviction  for the  offense committed on  May 7,\n1990  was  ordered  filed  on  May  18,  1992.    Chaklader's\nprobation was eventually revoked under the later petition.\n\n                             -3-\n\ncustody of him.   On  September 17,  1990, California  prison\n\nauthorities  notified federal authorities  that Chaklader was\n\navailable  on the  detainer.   When, as  Chaklader says,  the\n\nfederal authorities refused to take custody of him, Chaklader\n\nsought to have  the California state courts  revoke his state\n\nplea  agreement.   After failing  to get  this relief  in the\n\nstate courts,  Chaklader asserts  that he  filed unsuccessful\n\npetitions  for  habeas  corpus  in  federal  courts  in  both\n\nCalifornia  and   Massachusetts,  seeking  to   have  federal\n\nauthorities take custody of him.\n\n          On  May  18,  1992,  the  District  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Massachusetts  issued  a  second  petition  for\n\nrevocation of probation for Chaklader's commission of the May\n\n1990 offense.  See supra note  2.  Chaklader was brought from\n                        \n\nthe California prison to Boston on a writ of habeas corpus ad\n                                                             \n\nprosequendum   to  answer  the  second  probation  revocation\n            \n\npetition.   A probation violation hearing was held on June 1,\n\n1992,  approximately  twenty-one   months  after   California\n\nauthorities had first advised that they  were willing to make\n\nChaklader available to federal authorities for this purpose.\n\n          During the probation violation hearing, Chaklader's\n\nattorney asked  the court to consider the  time Chaklader had\n\nserved  on  the  California  sentence  in   determining  what\n\nsentence to  impose for Chaklader's probation  violation.  In\n\nhis allocution, Chaklader himself asked the court to consider\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe   California   sentence.     He  further   expressed  his\n\nfrustration  over his alleged  unsuccessful attempts  to have\n\nfederal authorities take custody of him so that his sentences\n\nwould run concurrently, complaining  that he had \"been trying\n\nfor two years to  come here.\"  The district  court thereafter\n\nrevoked Chaklader's  probation and ordered that  he serve the\n\nfull five-year  sentence that had originally  been suspended.\n\nThe sentence was  to be  served on and  after the  California\n\nstate sentence.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n          On appeal, Chaklader  contends that the twenty-one-\n\nmonth  delay between  the time  California authorities  first\n\nindicated their  readiness to  make him available  to federal\n\nauthorities  (September  17,  1990)   and  the  time  of  his\n\nprobation revocation hearing (June  1, 1992) violated Fed. R.\n\nCrim.  P. 32.1 and his  rights to a  speedy probation hearing\n\nunder  the due process clause.  A serious impediment to these\n\narguments is  that Chaklader  did not articulate  them below.\n\nAbsent  plain error, an  issue not presented  to the district\n\ncourt  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Argentine, 814  F.2d  783, 791  (1st  Cir. 1987);\n                     \n\nUnited States  v. Chambliss, 766  F.2d 1520, 1521  (11th Cir.\n                           \n\n1985).\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Chaklader is  unable to establish any  error on the\n\npart of the district court, let alone plain error.  Rule 32.1\n\nrequires  the affording  of a  prompt probable  cause hearing\n\n\"[w]henever  a person is held  in custody on  the ground that\n\nthe person has  violated a  condition of probation  . . .  .\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a)(1); see United States  v. Sackinger,\n                                                            \n\n537  F. Supp. 1245, 1249 (W.D.N.Y. 1982), aff'd, 704 F.2d 29,\n                                               \n\n30 (2d Cir. 1983).  Thereafter, the  revocation hearing shall\n\nbe  held  within  a  reasonable  time.    Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.\n\n32.1(a)(2).  Contrary to  Chaklader's contentions, he was not\n\nin  custody on the grounds of his federal probation violation\n                                                             \n\nwhen in 1990 California authorities purportedly indicated his\n\navailability   to  federal   authorities  on   the  detainer.\n\nChaklader was  instead serving,  and continued  thereafter to\n\nserve, a  state sentence in a state  facility.  Not until May\n\n1992  was Chaklader  finally  taken into  federal custody  to\n\nanswer  for violations  of the  conditions of  his probation.\n\nHis  probation violation  hearing  took place  less than  one\n\nmonth later.   There was  thus clearly no  violation of  Rule\n\n32.1.\n\n          For  similar  reasons,   Chaklader's  due   process\n\nargument fails as there is \"no constitutional duty to provide\n\npetitioner an adversary parole hearing until he is taken into\n                                                             \n\ncustody as a parole violator . .  . .\"  Moody v.

Wickham, 618 F.2d  1307, 1309 n.3 (9th Cir.  1979) (speedy\n          \n\nrevocation hearing protection under the due process clause is\n\n\"not triggered when the warrant is placed as a detainer at an\n\ninstitution where  the probationer  or parolee is  already in\n\ncustody awaiting disposal of an intervening charge or serving\n\na  sentence  for  a   crime  committed  while  on  supervised\n\nrelease.\"). \n\n          Chaklader  has  suffered  no  prejudice   from  the\n\ntwenty-one-month   delay   before   his   federal   probation\n\nrevocation  hearing.    It  is  not alleged  that  the  delay\n\nimpaired his ability to contest the revocation.  See Wickham,\n                                                            \n\n618 F.2d at 1310 (delay  must affect probationer's ability to\n\ncontest  facts  of revocation);  see  also  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMarion, 404  U.S. 307,  324 (for  pre-indictment delay  to be\n      \n\ncognizable  under  due process  clause,  defendant  must show\n\nactual  prejudice  to  the  defense of  the  criminal  case).\n\nIndeed,  it  would  be  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for\n\nChaklader to establish such prejudice since he pled guilty to\n\nthe  underlying  California   assault  and  battery   charge.\n\nMoreover,  the  passage  of   twenty-one  months  in  no  way\n\nrestricted   the   district   court's  ability   \"to   grant,\n\nretroactively,  the  equivalent  of   concurrent  sentences.\"\n\nMoody, 429 U.S. at 87.  Aware of the  California sentence and\n     \n\nthe time  served thereunder, the  district court  nonetheless\n\n                             -7-\n\nchose  to require  that  the reinstated  federal sentence  be\n\nfully served on and after the California sentence. \n\n          Thus  even  accepting  Chaklader's version  of  the\n\nfacts, and considering  arguments not presented  below, there\n\nwas  no violation of his right to a prompt revocation hearing\n\neither under Rule 32.1 or under the due process clause.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -8-\n",

Chaklader's\nprobation was eventually revoked under the later petition.\n\n                             -3-\n\ncustody of him.   On  September 17,  1990, California  prison\n\nauthorities  notified federal authorities  that Chaklader was\n\navailable  on the  detainer.   When, as  Chaklader says,  the\n\nfederal authorities refused to take custody of him, Chaklader\n\nsought to have  the California state courts  revoke his state\n\nplea  agreement.   After failing  to get  this relief  in the\n\nstate courts,  Chaklader asserts  that he  filed unsuccessful\n\npetitions  for  habeas  corpus  in  federal  courts  in  both\n\nCalifornia  and   Massachusetts,  seeking  to   have  federal\n\nauthorities take custody of him.\n\n          On  May  18,  1992,  the  District  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Massachusetts  issued  a  second  petition  for\n\nrevocation of probation for Chaklader's commission of the May\n\n1990 offense.  See supra note  2.  Chaklader was brought from\n                        \n\nthe California prison to Boston on a writ of habeas corpus ad\n                                                             \n\nprosequendum   to  answer  the  second  probation  revocation\n            \n\npetition.   A probation violation hearing was held on June 1,\n\n1992,  approximately  twenty-one   months  after   California\n\nauthorities had first advised that they  were willing to make\n\nChaklader available to federal authorities for this purpose.\n\n          During the probation violation hearing, Chaklader's\n\nattorney asked  the court to consider the  time Chaklader had\n\nserved  on  the  California  sentence  in   determining  what\n\nsentence to  impose for Chaklader's probation  violation.  In\n\nhis allocution, Chaklader himself asked the court to consider\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe   California   sentence.     He  further   expressed  his\n\nfrustration  over his alleged  unsuccessful attempts  to have\n\nfederal authorities take custody of him so that his sentences\n\nwould run concurrently, complaining  that he had \"been trying\n\nfor two years to  come here.\"  The district  court thereafter\n\nrevoked Chaklader's  probation and ordered that  he serve the\n\nfull five-year  sentence that had originally  been suspended.\n\nThe sentence was  to be  served on and  after the  California\n\nstate sentence.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n          On appeal, Chaklader  contends that the twenty-one-\n\nmonth  delay between  the time  California authorities  first\n\nindicated their  readiness to  make him available  to federal\n\nauthorities  (September  17,  1990)   and  the  time  of  his\n\nprobation revocation hearing (June  1, 1992) violated Fed. R.\n\nCrim.  P. 32.1 and his  rights to a  speedy probation hearing\n\nunder  the due process clause.  A serious impediment to these\n\narguments is  that Chaklader  did not articulate  them below.\n\nAbsent  plain error, an  issue not presented  to the district\n\ncourt  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.
