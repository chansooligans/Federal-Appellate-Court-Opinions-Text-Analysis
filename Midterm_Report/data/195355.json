Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                     \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                 Torruella, Selya and Stahl,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                        \n\n   Duon  G. Townsend, pro se, on Application for Certificate of\n                    \nProbable Cause.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per  Curiam.     Petitioner  requests  a certificate  of\n                \n\nprobable cause  (\"CPC\") to  appeal from the  district court's\n\ndismissal  without  prejudice  of  his  habeas  petition  for\n\nfailure  to exhaust  state remedies.   We  grant the  CPC and\n\ndismiss  the  petition with  prejudice  on  the grounds  that\n\npetitioner has  procedurally defaulted on his  federal habeas\n\nclaims  in state court and that there is not sufficient cause\n\nto excuse the default. \n\n          Petitioner's  failure to appeal  the denial  of his\n\nstate  habeas petition  to  the New  Hampshire Supreme  Court\n\nconstitutes  a procedural  default rather  than a  failure to\n\nexhaust state  remedies.  The  time for appealing  the denial\n\nhas  expired.    See  New  Hampshire  Supreme  Court  Rule 7.\n                    \n\nTherefore, petitioner is procedurally barred  from presenting\n\nhis claims to  the New  Hampshire Supreme Court  in order  to\n\nmeet the  exhaustion requirement.   See Coleman  v. Thompson,\n                                                            \n\n111 S. Ct. 2546, 2557 n.1 (1991).  \n\n          To  obtain federal  habeas  review of  procedurally\n\ndefaulted claims,  petitioner must demonstrate \"cause for the\n\ndefault and  actual  prejudice as  a  result of  the  alleged\n\nviolation  of federal  law,  or demonstrate  that failure  to\n\nconsider the claims will  result in a fundamental miscarriage\n\nof justice.\"  Coleman v.  Thompson, 111 S. Ct. at 2565.   The\n                                  \n\ncause  requirement is satisfied only by  a showing that \"some\n\nobjective  factor external to the defense\" impeded compliance\n\n                             -2-\n\nwith  the state procedural rule.  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n478,   488  (1986).     This  standard  applies   to  pro  se\n                                                             \n\npetitioners.  See, e.g.,  Caswell v. Ryan, 953 F.2d  853, 862\n                                         \n\n(3d Cir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 112 S.Ct. 2283 (1992).\n                       \n\n     It  is  clear  that  petitioner cannot  meet  the  cause\n\nrequirement.  The record  does not contain even a hint  of an\n\n\"objective factor\" that  caused the failure  to appeal.   Nor\n\ncan petitioner  claim ignorance  of the proper  procedure for\n\nfiling  an appeal.  The record demonstrates that he was aware\n\nof his right to  appeal.  In fact, petitioner  filed a notice\n\nof  appeal  with the  superior  court.    The superior  court\n\nreturned the notice  to him  with a note  instructing him  to\n\nfile  the appeal with the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  There\n\nis no \"cause\" for petitioner's  failure to do so.  It  is not\n\nnecessary to  address the  prejudice prong of  the cause-and-\n\nprejudice  test since  the cause  requirement is  clearly not\n\nsatisfied.  See Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1202 (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1987), cert. denied. 485 U.S. 990 (1988).\n                   \n\n          \"[A]   federal  habeas   court   may   consider   a\n\nprocedurally defaulted  claim absent  a showing of  cause for\n\nthe default  only where the petitioner  demonstrates that his\n\nis an 'extraordinary  case, where a constitutional  violation\n\nhas  probably  resulted  in  the conviction  of  one  who  is\n\nactually innocent. .  . .'\"  Hall v. DiPaolo,  986 F.2d 7, 10\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. at 496).\n                                          \n\n                             -3-\n\nFrom  the record,  it  is clear  that  this  is not  such  an\n\n\"extraordinary case.\"  Petitioner  does not  claim  that  the\n\nalleged   constitutional  violation   has  resulted   in  his\n\nconviction despite  his innocence, only that  it has deprived\n\nhim of early release.\n\n          Accordingly,   petitioner's   habeas  petition   is\n\ndismissed with prejudice. \n\n                             -4-\n",
