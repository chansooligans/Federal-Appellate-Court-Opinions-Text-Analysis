At\r\n\r\nall relevant times, a  single attorney represented  defendant\r\n\r\nand Perez.   Defendant  argues that the  joint representation\r\n\r\ndeprived  him of the effective  assistance of counsel, and he\r\n\r\nseeks to withdraw his plea.  Finding nothing in the record to\r\n\r\nshow   that  a  conflict   of  interests  impaired  counsel's\r\n\r\nperformance, we deny defendant the relief he seeks.\r\n\r\n                              I.\r\n\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\n                                    \r\n\r\n          From March 1990 to June 1990, Jeanette Diaz-Laurano\r\n\r\n(Diaz),  Edgardo Lopez-Rodriguez, and  Roberto Matos imported\r\n\r\ncocaine into the United States from the Netherlands Antilles.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  presentence  report,  defendant made  the\r\n\r\nnecessary arrangements,  paid for travel  expenses, and  paid\r\n\r\nthe couriers  $1000 per kilogram  of cocaine.   Defendant and\r\n\r\nPerez, his common-law wife, accompanied Diaz on two trips.\r\n\r\n          In  May 1991,  a grand  jury returned  a five-count\r\n\r\nindictment  against defendant  and  Perez  for conspiring  to\r\n\r\nimport,  importing,  and possessing  cocaine  with  intent to\r\n\r\ndistribute.    21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1),  952(a),  960,  963.\r\n\r\nDefendant  and  Perez  retained  Attorney  Edwin  Quinones to\r\n\r\nrepresent them.  \r\n\r\n                             -2-\r\n                              2\r\n\r\n          In June 1991, Perez moved to have her trial severed\r\n\r\nfrom  defendant's.    The  assigned  trial  judge  granted  a\r\n\r\nseverance  on September  24,  1991 and  scheduled defendant's\r\n\r\ntrial for October 11, several weeks before Perez's.\r\n\r\n          Meanwhile,   the   government  filed   motions  for\r\n\r\nreconsideration of  the severance,  and for a  hearing, under\r\n\r\nFed.  R. Crim.  P. 44(c),  on the  question of  whether joint\r\n\r\nrepresentation would \"jeopardize  both defendants[']  rights,\r\n\r\nparticularly  Milagros Perez-Delgado['s],\"  Government's Mot.\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nfor Rule 44(c) H'g, at 2.  On October 7, 1991, another judge,\r\n                  \r\n\r\nto  whom  the litigation  had  been  reassigned, vacated  the\r\n\r\nseverance, set a joint  trial for October 11, and  denied the\r\n\r\nrequest  for a  hearing into  the question  of a  conflict of\r\n\r\ninterests because a magistrate judge had previously held such\r\n\r\na hearing.\r\n\r\n          On the morning of  October 11, Perez pleaded guilty\r\n\r\nto one count of importing  cocaine, and the remaining  counts\r\n\r\nwere dismissed  as to her.   Defendant followed  suit several\r\n\r\nhours later by pleading to two  counts of cocaine importation\r\n\r\nand possession, on the condition that the remaining counts be\r\n\r\ndismissed.   Quinones  represented both  defendant and  Perez\r\n\r\nthrough their plea negotiations, change of plea hearings, and\r\n\r\ndefendant's sentencing proceeding.\r\n\r\n          Prior  to the  date  of her  sentencing proceeding,\r\n\r\nwhich  followed defendant's,  Perez  filed a  motion for  the\r\n\r\n                             -3-\r\n                              3\r\n\r\nappointment of separate counsel.  The trial court granted the\r\n\r\nmotion  because  it  found   that  a  conflict  of  interests\r\n\r\njeopardized  her right  to  effective assistance  of counsel.\r\n\r\nPerez is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\r\n                             II.\r\n\r\n          Defendant's contentions on appeal are:  that he was\r\n\r\nnever   adequately   informed   of   the   risks   of   joint\r\n\r\nrepresentation;  that the trial  judge had a  duty to inquire\r\n\r\ninto potential conflicts when  the severance was vacated; and\r\n\r\nthat  his  lawyer's  divided  loyalties  violated  his  Sixth\r\n\r\nAmendment  right to  the   effective  assistance of  counsel.\r\n\r\nDefendant  seeks to  withdraw  his plea  for those  reasons.1\r\n\r\nThe government  responds that the magistrate  judge presiding\r\n\r\nover  defendant's arraignment  adequately warned  him of  the\r\n\r\nrisks of  joint representation,  and that no  actual conflict\r\n\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n    Conflicts of Interests and Sixth Amendment Principles\r\n                                                         \r\n\r\n          A   defendant   has   a  right   to   conflict-free\r\n\r\nrepresentation under  the Sixth Amendment.   Wood v. Georgia,\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n450 U.S. 261, 271 (1981); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475,\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n1.  Defendant  also raises  a sentencing  issue, to  which we\r\ndevote nothing more than this footnote.  In a single two-line\r\nsentence in  his brief, defendant argues that the trial court\r\nerred in basing his sentence  on sixteen kilograms of cocaine\r\nrather than  fourteen kilograms.   The record  indicates that\r\ndefense  counsel  explicitly   conceded  at  sentencing  that\r\nsixteen  kilograms were involved in the offense, and there is\r\nample support for the trial court's calculations.\r\n\r\n                             -4-\r\n                              4\r\n\r\n489-90  (1978).  When two  or more defendants  share the same\r\n\r\ncounsel, conflicts of interests might arise.  \"[T]he conflict\r\n\r\nis within  the attorney's  loyalty; the  problem is  that the\r\n\r\nattorney might  not be  able  to represent  one client  fully\r\n\r\nwithout damaging the interests of  the other client.\"  United\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nStates ex rel.

Although \"in  some  cases  multiple defendants  can\r\n\r\nappropriately be represented by one  attorney,\" Holloway, 435\r\n                                                        \r\n\r\nU.S.   at  482,  joint   representation  violates  the  Sixth\r\n\r\nAmendment  when  it gives  rise  to a  conflict  of interests\r\n\r\nadversely  affecting  the lawyer's  performance.   Cuyler  v.\r\n                                                         \r\n\r\nSullivan,  446  U.S.  335,   348  (1980);  United  States  v.\r\n                                                         \r\n\r\nMazzaferro,  865 F.2d 450, 455 (1st Cir. 1989).  Prejudice in\r\n          \r\n\r\nsuch cases is presumed.   Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d at  455; Brien\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nv. United States, 695 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1982).\r\n                \r\n\r\n          Conflicts may  arise at  any stage of  a proceeding\r\n\r\nbecause  codefendants  are  rarely,  if   ever,  identically-\r\n\r\nsituated.    The  joint  attorney  may  have  to  prefer  one\r\n\r\ndefendant  over  the  other  at trial,  where,  for  example,\r\n\r\nevidence  favorable to  one defendant  harms another;  during\r\n\r\nplea   negotiations,  where   advocacy   for  one   defendant\r\n\r\nundermines the position of others, or when a plea  bargaining\r\n\r\noffer is  conditioned  on one  defendant  testifying  against\r\n\r\nanother; and at sentencing, where sentencing factors compel a\r\n\r\nlawyer to distinguish  between clients.  See United States v.\r\n                                                          \r\n\r\n                             -5-\r\n                              5\r\n\r\nCurcio, 680 F.2d  881, 887 (2d  Cir. 1982) (providing  myriad\r\n      \r\n\r\nexamples  of  conflicts); Fed.

P. 44(c)  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee's notes;  ABA Standards for  Criminal Justice,  The\r\n\r\nDefense Function   4-3.5 (2d ed. 1980).  \r\n\r\n          \"It  has   long  been  recognized  that  there  are\r\n\r\ninherent difficulties\"  in reviewing  claims of  conflicts of\r\n\r\ninterests.

These difficulties arise because \"in a case of\r\n\r\njoint representation  of conflicting interests the evil . . .\r\n\r\nis in what  the advocate finds  himself compelled to  refrain\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nfrom doing . .  . .\"  Holloway, 435 U.S.  at 490 (emphasis in\r\n                              \r\n\r\noriginal).    It  is  often unclear  \"that  the  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterests, and  not pure trial strategy,\" is  the reason \"for\r\n\r\nthe tactics adopted--or forgone--at trial.\"  Curcio, 680 F.2d\r\n                                                   \r\n\r\nat 887.\r\n\r\n                Trial Court's Duty of Inquiry\r\n                                             \r\n\r\n          So  \"ubiquitous and  insidious\"  are the  risks  of\r\n\r\nmultiple  representation, Curcio,  680  F.2d at  887, and  so\r\n                                \r\n\r\nfundamental is the right to counsel, that the Sixth Amendment\r\n\r\nimposes duties on trial courts in certain cases.

Defendant's  timely  objections  to  joint\r\n\r\nrepresentation must be  investigated, and  inquiries must  be\r\n\r\nmade  into the propriety  of multiple representation whenever\r\n\r\nthe trial  court  knows  or  reasonably should  know  that  a\r\n\r\nparticular conflict exists.

We  do not  require that  defendants make  narrative\r\n\r\nresponses, or that defendants  be warned of every conceivable\r\n\r\nrisk.    See  Foster,  469 F.2d  at  5  (form  of  hearing is\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                             -9-\r\n                              9\r\n\r\ngenerally within  the trial  court's discretion).   Those are\r\n\r\nrequirements we  might  impose if  a  Foster inquiry  were  a\r\n                                            \r\n\r\nprelude   to  a   waiver  of   the  right   to  conflict-free\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  But it is not.  A defendant can successfully\r\n\r\nchallenge  his  conviction  on  the ground  that  a  conflict\r\n\r\nimpaired his lawyer's performance, even if an adequate Foster\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\ninquiry  occurred.  See Mazzaferro,  865 F.2d at 455; Foster,\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n469 F.2d at 5.  \r\n\r\n          We  have required that  courts explain  and explore\r\n\r\nthe risks of joint representation, in  lay persons' terms, to\r\n\r\nenable  defendants to  appreciate how conflicts  might impair\r\n\r\nthe lawyer's performance.  United  States v. Elkins, 774 F.2d\r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n530,  541 (1st Cir. 1985); United States v. Waldman, 579 F.2d\r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n649,  653 (1st Cir. 1978); United States v. Donahue, 560 F.2d\r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n1039, 1043-44 (1st Cir.  1977).  The magistrate in  this case\r\n\r\npersonally addressed defendant regarding the possibility of a\r\n\r\nconflict,  stated that he  had a  right to  separate counsel,\r\n\r\nprovided examples of conflicts that might arise at trial, and\r\n\r\nelicited an unequivocal \"Yes,\"  in response to a  question on\r\n\r\nwhether defendant had discussed  \"the problem\" with counsel.2\r\n\r\nDefendant argues that his mental health problems, illiteracy,\r\n\r\nand  lack   of  a  formal  education   rendered  the  inquiry\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n2.  The  magistrate also obtained  defendant's signature on a\r\nform  entitled,  \"Acknowledgment   of  Joint   Representation\r\nAdmonishment,\" which essentially repeated what the magistrate\r\nstated in open court.\r\n\r\n                             -10-\r\n                              10\r\n\r\ninadequate.    The record  does  not  suggest, however,  that\r\n\r\ndefendant was  incompetent, or  that he could  not comprehend\r\n\r\nthe  magistrate's explanation.    On the  contrary, defendant\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  he  understood.    Moreover,  defendant's\r\n\r\nqualified response as to whether he desired to continue to be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by Quinones--\"At  this  time, yes.\"--  suggested\r\n\r\nthat his answers  were not  merely rote.   While the  inquiry\r\n\r\nmight not  have  been exemplary,  it was  adequate to  ensure\r\n\r\ndefendant understood the risks. \r\n\r\n          Next, defendant  argues that the trial  court had a\r\n\r\nduty to  inquire  into  the  possibility  of  a  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterests  later  in  the  proceeding, when  it  vacated  the\r\n\r\nseverance.    According  to   defendant,  the  trial  court's\r\n\r\ndecision placed  defense counsel  in the position  of perhaps\r\n\r\nfavoring one client  over the  other at trial,  and that  the\r\n\r\ncourt's  failure to provide a Foster hearing at that time was\r\n                                    \r\n\r\nimproper.3\r\n\r\n          We agree  with defendant that the trial court had a\r\n\r\nduty to investigate  the possibility  of a  conflict when  it\r\n\r\nvacated the severance.   Under Rule 44(c), the  trial court's\r\n\r\nduty  to  inquire  into  the possibility  of  a  conflict  of\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n3.  The government, not  defense counsel, requested a  second\r\nFoster  hearing  when it  moved  for  reconsideration of  the\r\n      \r\nseverance  order.   The trial  judge denied  the government's\r\nmotion, shortly  after vacating  the severance,  when defense\r\ncounsel  confirmed  that  the  magistrate  previously  held a\r\nFoster hearing.\r\n      \r\n\r\n                             -11-\r\n                              11\r\n\r\ninterest  is  \"a continuing  one.\"   Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 44(c)\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee's   notes.     That   duty   may   entail\r\n\r\nreinitiating  an inquiry  when  there are  \"new developments\"\r\n\r\nsuggesting a potential conflict.  Id.  \r\n                                     \r\n\r\n          In  this case,  defense counsel  was  preparing for\r\n\r\nseparate  trials until  the severance  was vacated,  only one\r\n\r\nweek  before  trial.     The  order  vacating  the  severance\r\n\r\nheightened the risk that a  conflict might infect certain  of\r\n\r\ndefense  counsel's strategic decisions.   See,  e.g., Curcio,\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n680  F.2d  at  887  (discussing  dilemmas  confronting  trial\r\n\r\ncounsel for multiple  defendants, including \"whether  to have\r\n\r\none defendant  testify while the other  remains silent\"); cf.\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nCuyler,  446  U.S.  at  347  (provision  of  separate  trials\r\n      \r\n\r\nsignificantly  reduced  the  potential for  a  divergence  in\r\n\r\ninterests).  Given that heightened risk, the court had a duty\r\n\r\nto inquire whether a conflict would develop at trial.   \r\n\r\n          Contrary   to   defendant's  argument   on  appeal,\r\n\r\nhowever,  we find  that the  trial court  did not  shirk that\r\n\r\nduty.     Prior   to  vacating   the  severance,   the  court\r\n\r\ninvestigated  whether the  defense  strategies  of Perez  and\r\n\r\ndefendant  would diverge.   Defendant's  affidavit supporting\r\n\r\nthe request for  separate trials stated  that, if the  trials\r\n\r\nwere severed, he would  testify at Perez's trial that  he had\r\n\r\nhad  an  affair  with  Jeanette Diaz  (the  government's  key\r\n\r\nwitness),   and  that  she  was  falsely  incriminating  both\r\n\r\n                             -12-\r\n                              12\r\n\r\ndefendant and Perez--his  common-law wife--because  defendant\r\n\r\n\"did not  please  [Diaz].\"   The  court concluded  from  that\r\n\r\naffidavit and  from inquiries he  made of defense  counsel at\r\n\r\nthe  hearing  on  the  motion for  reconsideration  that  the\r\n\r\ncodefendants'  strategies  were  harmonious.    Defendant has\r\n\r\nidentified no other developments  in his case occurring prior\r\n\r\nto  the  order  vacating   the  severance  that  should  have\r\n\r\nimplicated a duty to inquire further.\r\n\r\n          Although the trial court  had a duty to investigate\r\n\r\nthe potential for a  conflict when it vacated  the severance,\r\n\r\nthe court did  not err  by not giving  defendant any  further\r\n\r\nexplication  of  the perils  of  joint  representation.   The\r\n\r\nmagistrate cautioned defendant before  the cases were severed\r\n\r\nthat \"with respect of particular defenses and decisions, such\r\n\r\nas whether or  not to take  the stand or  to call  particular\r\n\r\nwitnesses or how to  conduct a cross examination what  may be\r\n\r\nin one's  best interest will turn  out not to be  in the best\r\n\r\ninterest of the other.\"   While it would have  been advisable\r\n\r\nto repeat this admonition, it was not necessary to do so.  We\r\n\r\nare  satisfied   that   the  magistrate's   Foster   hearing,\r\n                                                  \r\n\r\nsupplemented  by the  trial  court's  determination that  the\r\n\r\ndefenses were consistent,  adequately explored the  potential\r\n\r\n                             -13-\r\n                              13\r\n\r\nfor a conflict and ensured that defendant was not ignorant or\r\n\r\nmisadvised in his choice of counsel.4\r\n\r\n     Defendant's Burden of Showing Conflict of Interests\r\n                                                        \r\n\r\n          Our determination that an adequate inquiry occurred\r\n\r\ndoes  not end our analysis of whether a conflict of interests\r\n\r\nviolated  defendant's   right  to  effective   assistance  of\r\n\r\ncounsel.   Rather, because a satisfactory  inquiry appears in\r\n\r\nthe record, we turn to  whether defendant carried the  burden\r\n\r\nof  showing that  an actual  conflict adversely  affected his\r\n\r\nlawyer's performance.   Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d  at 455; Foster,\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n469 F.2d at 5.   \r\n\r\n          Defendant makes two arguments in an effort to carry\r\n\r\nthat  burden.  First, he asserts that a conflict of interests\r\n\r\nresulted in  the disparity  between his sentence  and Perez's\r\n\r\n(188 months versus time  served).  We cannot infer  from that\r\n\r\ndisparity,  however, that a  conflict of  interests adversely\r\n\r\naffected  his   lawyer's  performance.     According  to  the\r\n\r\ngovernment, Perez's drastically  lower sentence reflected her\r\n\r\nsubstantial  assistance in obtaining convictions in unrelated\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n4.  One  might argue  that  the trial  court  had a  duty  to\r\ninquire  further  into  the   potential  for  a  conflict  of\r\ninterests  prior to accepting  defendant's guilty plea, where\r\nPerez,  still  represented  by  Quinones,  changed  her  plea\r\nseveral  hours earlier.   We decline to  consider that issue,\r\nhowever, because neither party has addressed it. \r\n\r\n                             -14-\r\n                              14\r\n\r\n          Defendant's   remaining    claim   of   ineffective\r\n\r\nassistance  pertains  to  the  circumstances  surrounding his\r\n\r\ndecision to change his plea several hours after Perez changed\r\n\r\nhers.  While  this may be  a stronger claim,  our ability  to\r\n\r\nevaluate it is hampered by the state of the record.  There is\r\n\r\nlittle  evidence  regarding  defendant's  decision  to  plead\r\n\r\nguilty.   In addition, we  have no record  of what transpired\r\n\r\nduring Perez's change of plea hearing.  The government stated\r\n\r\nat oral  argument that defendant  sat in the  courtroom while\r\n\r\nPerez accepted the government's  version of the facts  at her\r\n\r\nchange  of plea hearing.  But neither her plea agreement, nor\r\n\r\nthe  transcript of her Rule 11  hearing is part of the record\r\n\r\nin this  case.  The record does not indicate that Perez would\r\n\r\nhave testified if defendant  had gone to trial.   Cf. Trammel\r\n                                                             \r\n\r\nv.

Defendant and Perez retained Attorney Edwin Quinones to represent them.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1991, Perez moved to have her trial severed from defendant's.  The assigned trial judge granted a severance on September 24, 1991 and scheduled defendant's trial for October 11, several weeks before Perez's.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the government filed motions for reconsideration of the severance, and for a hearing, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c), on the question of whether joint representation would \"jeopardize both defendants['] rights, particularly Milagros Perez-Delgado['s],\" Government's Mot. for Rule 44(c) H'g, at 2.  On October 7, 1991, another judge, to whom the litigation had been reassigned, vacated the severance, set a joint trial for October 11, and denied the request for a hearing into the question of a conflict of interests because a magistrate judge had previously held such a hearing.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of October 11, Perez pleaded guilty to one count of importing cocaine, and the remaining counts were dismissed as to her.  Defendant followed suit several hours later by pleading to two counts of cocaine importation and possession, on the condition that the remaining counts be dismissed.  Quinones represented both defendant and Perez through their plea negotiations, change of plea hearings, and defendant's sentencing proceeding.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the date of her sentencing proceeding, which followed defendant's, Perez filed a motion for the appointment of separate counsel.  The trial court granted the motion because it found that a conflict of interests jeopardized her right to effective assistance of counsel.  Perez is not a party to this appeal.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>II.</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's contentions on appeal are:  that he was never adequately informed of the risks of joint representation;  that the trial judge had a duty to inquire into potential conflicts when the severance was vacated;  and that his lawyer's divided loyalties violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Defendant seeks to withdraw his plea for those reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government responds that the magistrate judge presiding over defendant's arraignment adequately warned him of the risks of joint representation, and that no actual conflict developed.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\r\n      <p>Conflicts of Interests and Sixth Amendment Principles</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant has a right to conflict-free representation under the Sixth Amendment.  Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 271, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1103, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981);  Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489-90, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978).  When two or more defendants share the same counsel, conflicts of interests might arise.  \"[T]he conflict is within the attorney's loyalty;  the problem is that the attorney might not be able to represent one client fully without damaging the interests of the other client.\"  United States ex rel. Tonaldi v. Elrod, 716 F.2d 431, 437 (7th Cir.1983).  Although \"in some cases multiple defendants can appropriately be represented by one attorney,\" Holloway, 435 U.S. at 482, 98 S.Ct. at 1178, joint representation violates the Sixth Amendment when it gives rise to a conflict of interests adversely affecting the lawyer's performance.  Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980);  United States v. Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d 450, 455 (1st Cir.1989).  Prejudice in such cases is presumed.

The joint attorney may have to prefer one defendant over the other at trial, where, for example, evidence favorable to one defendant harms another;  during plea negotiations, where advocacy for one defendant undermines the position of others, or when a plea bargaining offer is conditioned on one defendant testifying against another;  and at sentencing, where sentencing factors compel a lawyer to distinguish between clients.  See United States v. Curcio, 680 F.2d 881, 887 (2d Cir.1982) (providing myriad examples of conflicts);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c) advisory committee's notes;  ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function Sec. 4-3.5 (2d ed. 1980).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It has long been recognized that there are inherent difficulties\" in reviewing claims of conflicts of interests.  Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d at 456 (citing Holloway, 435 U.S. at 490, 98 S.Ct. at 1182).   These difficulties arise because \"in a case of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil ... is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to refrain from doing....\"  Holloway, 435 U.S. at 490, 98 S.Ct. at 1182 (emphasis in original).  It is often unclear \"that the conflict of interests, and not pure trial strategy,\" is the reason \"for the tactics adopted--or forgone--at trial.\"  Curcio, 680 F.2d at 887.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>Trial Court's Duty of Inquiry</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">So \"ubiquitous and insidious\" are the risks of multiple representation, Curcio, 680 F.2d at 887, and so fundamental is the right to counsel, that the Sixth Amendment imposes duties on trial courts in certain cases.  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 346, 100 S.Ct. at 1717.   Defendant's timely objections to joint representation must be investigated, and inquiries must be made into the propriety of multiple representation whenever the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists.  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 346-47, 100 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 44(c) expands these duties by requiring an inquiry into the possibility of a conflict in all cases where jointly-charged defendants retain the same counsel.  Under Rule 44(c), the trial court must \"inquire with respect to such joint representation and ... personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of counsel, including separate representation.\"   Id.  Moreover, \"[u]nless it appears that there is good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise,\" Rule 44(c) requires the court to \"take such measures as may be appropriate to protect each defendant's right to counsel.\"   Id.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 44(c) has an antecedent in this Circuit, United States v.

The warning and the inquiry must be on the record.  Id.;  accord Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c) advisory committee's notes.  We require a Foster inquiry to ensure that defendants have been properly warned and to \"prevent the uncertainty that arises when defendants make post-conviction claims of ignorance or misadvice.\"  United States v. Martorano, 620 F.2d 912, 915 n. 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 952, 101 S.Ct. 356, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980);  see also Colon v.

Where there is no record of a satisfactory inquiry, the government bears the burden of proving that prejudice to the defendant was improbable.

We do not require that defendants make narrative responses, or that defendants be warned of every conceivable risk.  See Foster, 469 F.2d at 5 (form of hearing is generally within the trial court's discretion).  Those are requirements we might impose if a Foster inquiry were a prelude to a waiver of the right to conflict-free representation.  But it is not.  A defendant can successfully challenge his conviction on the ground that a conflict impaired his lawyer's performance, even if an adequate Foster inquiry occurred.  See Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d at 455;  Foster, 469 F.2d at 5.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have required that courts explain and explore the risks of joint representation, in lay persons' terms, to enable defendants to appreciate how conflicts might impair the lawyer's performance.  United States v. Elkins, 774 F.2d 530, 541 (1st Cir.1985);  United States v. Waldman, 579 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir.1978);   United States v. Donahue, 560 F.2d 1039, 1043-44 (1st Cir.1977).  The magistrate in this case personally addressed defendant regarding the possibility of a conflict, stated that he had a right to separate counsel, provided examples of conflicts that might arise at trial, and elicited an unequivocal \"Yes,\" in response to a question on whether defendant had discussed \"the problem\" with counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Defendant argues that his mental health problems, illiteracy, and lack of a formal education rendered the inquiry inadequate.  The record does not suggest, however, that defendant was incompetent, or that he could not comprehend the magistrate's explanation.  On the contrary, defendant acknowledged that he understood.  Moreover, defendant's qualified response as to whether he desired to continue to be represented by Quinones--\"At this time, yes.\"--suggested that his answers were not merely rote.  While the inquiry might not have been exemplary, it was adequate to ensure defendant understood the risks.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, defendant argues that the trial court had a duty to inquire into the possibility of a conflict of interests later in the proceeding, when it vacated the severance.  According to defendant, the trial court's decision placed defense counsel in the position of perhaps favoring one client over the other at trial, and that the court's failure to provide a Foster hearing at that time was improper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendant that the trial court had a duty to investigate the possibility of a conflict when it vacated the severance.  Under Rule 44(c), the trial court's duty to inquire into the possibility of a conflict of interest is \"a continuing one.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c) advisory committee's notes.  That duty may entail reinitiating an inquiry when there are \"new developments\" suggesting a potential conflict.  Id.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, defense counsel was preparing for separate trials until the severance was vacated, only one week before trial.  The order vacating the severance heightened the risk that a conflict might infect certain of defense counsel's strategic decisions.  See, e.g., Curcio, 680 F.2d at 887 (discussing dilemmas confronting trial counsel for multiple defendants, including \"whether to have one defendant testify while the other remains silent\");  cf. Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 347, 100 S.Ct. at 1717 (provision of separate trials significantly reduced the potential for a divergence in interests).  Given that heightened risk, the court had a duty to inquire whether a conflict would develop at trial.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to defendant's argument on appeal, however, we find that the trial court did not shirk that duty.  Prior to vacating the severance, the court investigated whether the defense strategies of Perez and defendant would diverge.  Defendant's affidavit supporting the request for separate trials stated that, if the trials were severed, he would testify at Perez's trial that he had had an affair with Jeanette Diaz (the government's key witness), and that she was falsely incriminating both defendant and Perez--his common-law wife--because defendant \"did not please [Diaz].\"  The court concluded from that affidavit and from inquiries he made of defense counsel at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that the codefendants' strategies were harmonious.  Defendant has identified no other developments in his case occurring prior to the order vacating the severance that should have implicated a duty to inquire further.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial court had a duty to investigate the potential for a conflict when it vacated the severance, the court did not err by not giving defendant any further explication of the perils of joint representation.  The magistrate cautioned defendant before the cases were severed that \"with respect of particular defenses and decisions, such as whether or not to take the stand or to call particular witnesses or how to conduct a cross examination what may be in one's best interest will turn out not to be in the best interest of the other.\"   While it would have been advisable to repeat this admonition, it was not necessary to do so.  We are satisfied that the magistrate's Foster hearing, supplemented by the trial court's determination that the defenses were consistent, adequately explored the potential for a conflict and ensured that defendant was not ignorant or misadvised in his choice of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\r\n      <p>Defendant's Burden of Showing Conflict of Interests</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that an adequate inquiry occurred does not end our analysis of whether a conflict of interests violated defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel.  Rather, because a satisfactory inquiry appears in the record, we turn to whether defendant carried the burden of showing that an actual conflict adversely affected his lawyer's performance.  Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d at 455;  Foster, 469 F.2d at 5.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant makes two arguments in an effort to carry that burden.  First, he asserts that a conflict of interests resulted in the disparity between his sentence and Perez's (188 months versus time served).  We cannot infer from that disparity, however, that a conflict of interests adversely affected his lawyer's performance.  According to the government, Perez's drastically lower sentence reflected her substantial assistance in obtaining convictions in unrelated cases.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's remaining claim of ineffective assistance pertains to the circumstances surrounding his decision to change his plea several hours after Perez changed hers.  While this may be a stronger claim, our ability to evaluate it is hampered by the state of the record.  There is little evidence regarding defendant's decision to plead guilty.  In addition, we have no record of what transpired during Perez's change of plea hearing.  The government stated at oral argument that defendant sat in the courtroom while Perez accepted the government's version of the facts at her change of plea hearing.  But neither her plea agreement, nor the transcript of her Rule 11 hearing is part of the record in this case.  The record does not indicate that Perez would have testified if defendant had gone to trial.  Cf. Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 53, 100 S.Ct. 906, 914, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980) (witness-spouse holds privilege to refuse to testify adversely).  Consequently, we cannot fairly assess whether a conflict of interests infected Quinones's representation of defendant during plea negotiations and his change of plea hearing.  Because this is not a case where the record allows us to evaluate fully and fairly the merits of defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny his request on direct appeal for leave to withdraw his plea.  See United States v. Rinard, 956 F.2d 85, 87 (5th Cir.1992).  Defendant may raise the claim anew, if he so chooses, in a habeas corpus petition.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\r\n        <p> Defendant also raises a sentencing issue, to which we devote nothing more than this footnote.  In a single two-line sentence in his brief, defendant argues that the trial court erred in basing his sentence on sixteen kilograms of cocaine rather than fourteen kilograms.  The record indicates that defense counsel explicitly conceded at sentencing that sixteen kilograms were involved in the offense, and there is ample support for the trial court's calculations</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\r\n        <p> The magistrate also obtained defendant's signature on a form entitled, \"Acknowledgment of Joint Representation Admonishment,\" which essentially repeated what the magistrate stated in open court</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\r\n        <p> The government, not defense counsel, requested a second Foster hearing when it moved for reconsideration of the severance order.  The trial judge denied the government's motion, shortly after vacating the severance, when defense counsel confirmed that the magistrate previously held a Foster hearing</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\r\n        <p> One might argue that the trial court had a duty to inquire further into the potential for a conflict of interests prior to accepting defendant's guilty plea, where Perez, still represented by Quinones, changed her plea several hours earlier.  We decline to consider that issue, however, because neither party has addressed it</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    ",

At all relevant times, a single attorney represented defendant and Perez.  Defendant argues that the joint representation deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel, and he seeks to withdraw his plea.  Finding nothing in the record to show that a conflict of interests impaired counsel's performance, we deny defendant the relief he seeks.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>I.</p>\r\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">From March 1990 to June 1990, Jeanette Diaz-Laurano (Diaz), Edgardo Lopez-Rodriguez, and Roberto Matos imported cocaine into the United States from the Netherlands Antilles.  According to the presentence report, defendant made the necessary arrangements, paid for travel expenses, and paid the couriers $1000 per kilogram of cocaine.  Defendant and Perez, his common-law wife, accompanied Diaz on two trips.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, a grand jury returned a five-count indictment against defendant and Perez for conspiring to import, importing, and possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.  21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 952(a), 960, 963.  Defendant and Perez retained Attorney Edwin Quinones to represent them.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1991, Perez moved to have her trial severed from defendant's.  The assigned trial judge granted a severance on September 24, 1991 and scheduled defendant's trial for October 11, several weeks before Perez's.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the government filed motions for reconsideration of the severance, and for a hearing, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c), on the question of whether joint representation would \"jeopardize both defendants['] rights, particularly Milagros Perez-Delgado['s],\" Government's Mot. for Rule 44(c) H'g, at 2.  On October 7, 1991, another judge, to whom the litigation had been reassigned, vacated the severance, set a joint trial for October 11, and denied the request for a hearing into the question of a conflict of interests because a magistrate judge had previously held such a hearing.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of October 11, Perez pleaded guilty to one count of importing cocaine, and the remaining counts were dismissed as to her.  Defendant followed suit several hours later by pleading to two counts of cocaine importation and possession, on the condition that the remaining counts be dismissed.  Quinones represented both defendant and Perez through their plea negotiations, change of plea hearings, and defendant's sentencing proceeding.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the date of her sentencing proceeding, which followed defendant's, Perez filed a motion for the appointment of separate counsel.  The trial court granted the motion because it found that a conflict of interests jeopardized her right to effective assistance of counsel.  Perez is not a party to this appeal.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>II.</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's contentions on appeal are:  that he was never adequately informed of the risks of joint representation;  that the trial judge had a duty to inquire into potential conflicts when the severance was vacated;  and that his lawyer's divided loyalties violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Defendant seeks to withdraw his plea for those reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government responds that the magistrate judge presiding over defendant's arraignment adequately warned him of the risks of joint representation, and that no actual conflict developed.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\r\n      <p>Conflicts of Interests and Sixth Amendment Principles</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant has a right to conflict-free representation under the Sixth Amendment.

The magistrate in this case personally addressed defendant regarding the possibility of a conflict, stated that he had a right to separate counsel, provided examples of conflicts that might arise at trial, and elicited an unequivocal \"Yes,\" in response to a question on whether defendant had discussed \"the problem\" with counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Defendant argues that his mental health problems, illiteracy, and lack of a formal education rendered the inquiry inadequate.  The record does not suggest, however, that defendant was incompetent, or that he could not comprehend the magistrate's explanation.  On the contrary, defendant acknowledged that he understood.  Moreover, defendant's qualified response as to whether he desired to continue to be represented by Quinones--\"At this time, yes.\"--suggested that his answers were not merely rote.

Under Rule 44(c), the trial court's duty to inquire into the possibility of a conflict of interest is \"a continuing one.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c) advisory committee's notes.

The order vacating the severance heightened the risk that a conflict might infect certain of defense counsel's strategic decisions.  See, e.g., Curcio, 680 F.2d at 887 (discussing dilemmas confronting trial counsel for multiple defendants, including \"whether to have one defendant testify while the other remains silent\");  cf. Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 347, 100 S.Ct. at 1717 (provision of separate trials significantly reduced the potential for a divergence in interests).  Given that heightened risk, the court had a duty to inquire whether a conflict would develop at trial.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to defendant's argument on appeal, however, we find that the trial court did not shirk that duty.  Prior to vacating the severance, the court investigated whether the defense strategies of Perez and defendant would diverge.  Defendant's affidavit supporting the request for separate trials stated that, if the trials were severed, he would testify at Perez's trial that he had had an affair with Jeanette Diaz (the government's key witness), and that she was falsely incriminating both defendant and Perez--his common-law wife--because defendant \"did not please [Diaz].\"  The court concluded from that affidavit and from inquiries he made of defense counsel at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that the codefendants' strategies were harmonious.  Defendant has identified no other developments in his case occurring prior to the order vacating the severance that should have implicated a duty to inquire further.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial court had a duty to investigate the potential for a conflict when it vacated the severance, the court did not err by not giving defendant any further explication of the perils of joint representation.  The magistrate cautioned defendant before the cases were severed that \"with respect of particular defenses and decisions, such as whether or not to take the stand or to call particular witnesses or how to conduct a cross examination what may be in one's best interest will turn out not to be in the best interest of the other.\"   While it would have been advisable to repeat this admonition, it was not necessary to do so.  We are satisfied that the magistrate's Foster hearing, supplemented by the trial court's determination that the defenses were consistent, adequately explored the potential for a conflict and ensured that defendant was not ignorant or misadvised in his choice of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\r\n      <p>Defendant's Burden of Showing Conflict of Interests</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that an adequate inquiry occurred does not end our analysis of whether a conflict of interests violated defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel.  Rather, because a satisfactory inquiry appears in the record, we turn to whether defendant carried the burden of showing that an actual conflict adversely affected his lawyer's performance.  Mazzaferro, 865 F.2d at 455;  Foster, 469 F.2d at 5.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant makes two arguments in an effort to carry that burden.  First, he asserts that a conflict of interests resulted in the disparity between his sentence and Perez's (188 months versus time served).  We cannot infer from that disparity, however, that a conflict of interests adversely affected his lawyer's performance.  According to the government, Perez's drastically lower sentence reflected her substantial assistance in obtaining convictions in unrelated cases.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's remaining claim of ineffective assistance pertains to the circumstances surrounding his decision to change his plea several hours after Perez changed hers.  While this may be a stronger claim, our ability to evaluate it is hampered by the state of the record.  There is little evidence regarding defendant's decision to plead guilty.  In addition, we have no record of what transpired during Perez's change of plea hearing.  The government stated at oral argument that defendant sat in the courtroom while Perez accepted the government's version of the facts at her change of plea hearing.  But neither her plea agreement, nor the transcript of her Rule 11 hearing is part of the record in this case.  The record does not indicate that Perez would have testified if defendant had gone to trial.  Cf. Trammel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span>, 914, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110212\"><a href=\"/opinion/110212/trammel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span> (1980) (witness-spouse holds privilege to refuse to testify adversely).  Consequently, we cannot fairly assess whether a conflict of interests infected Quinones's representation of defendant during plea negotiations and his change of plea hearing.  Because this is not a case where the record allows us to evaluate fully and fairly the merits of defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny his request on direct appeal for leave to withdraw his plea.  See United States v. Rinard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577216\"><a href=\"/opinion/577216/united-states-v-timothy-rinard/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 87 (5th Cir.1992).  Defendant may raise the claim anew, if he so chooses, in a habeas corpus petition.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\r\n        <p> Defendant also raises a sentencing issue, to which we devote nothing more than this footnote.  In a single two-line sentence in his brief, defendant argues that the trial court erred in basing his sentence on sixteen kilograms of cocaine rather than fourteen kilograms.  The record indicates that defense counsel explicitly conceded at sentencing that sixteen kilograms were involved in the offense, and there is ample support for the trial court's calculations</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\r\n        <p> The magistrate also obtained defendant's signature on a form entitled, \"Acknowledgment of Joint Representation Admonishment,\" which essentially repeated what the magistrate stated in open court</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\r\n        <p> The government, not defense counsel, requested a second Foster hearing when it moved for reconsideration of the severance order.  The trial judge denied the government's motion, shortly after vacating the severance, when defense counsel confirmed that the magistrate previously held a Foster hearing</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\r\n        <p> One might argue that the trial court had a duty to inquire further into the potential for a conflict of interests prior to accepting defendant's guilty plea, where Perez, still represented by Quinones, changed her plea several hours earlier.  We decline to consider that issue, however, because neither party has addressed it</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    ",
