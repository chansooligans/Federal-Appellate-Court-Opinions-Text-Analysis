Petitioner  Michael Kingsley challenges the\n               \n\nlegality  of special  parole  terms imposed  as  part of  his\n\nsentence  for  multiple  drug violations.    He  argues that,\n\nbecause such sanctions were abolished between the time of his\n\noffenses  and the time of his  sentencing, the district court\n\nshould have applied the law in effect on the latter date.  We\n\ndisagree  and therefore affirm  the denial  of his  motion to\n\ncorrect sentence under 28 U.S.C.    2255 and/or Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 35(a). \n\n     From March 1977  to May 1985, petitioner was  the leader\n\nof a twenty-three member organization engaged in distributing\n\ncocaine and marijuana  in western Massachusetts.   In January\n\n1987, he pled guilty to  22 separate offenses as follows: one\n\ncount  of conspiracy to distribute cocaine,  21 U.S.C.   846,\n\none count  of conspiracy  to distribute  marijuana, id.,  ten\n                                                       \n\ncounts of  cocaine distribution,  21 U.S.C.    841(a),  three\n\ncounts   of  marijuana  distribution,   id.,  one   count  of\n                                           \n\nconducting a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C.   848,\n\nand  six  related  tax  offenses.    Sentencing  occurred  on\n\nFebruary  17,  1987.    At  the  government's  recommendation\n\npursuant to a plea bargain, the district court imposed twelve\n\nten-year prison terms (for the continuing criminal enterprise\n\noffense  and each of the cocaine  offenses) and ten five-year\n\nprison  terms (for each of  the marijuana and tax offenses)--\n\nall to be served concurrently.   The court also imposed three\n\n                             -3-\n\nyears  of  special parole  for  each  of  the eleven  cocaine\n\noffenses (the conspiracy  count and  ten substantive  counts)\n\nand  two  years of  special  parole  for  each of  the  three\n\nsubstantive marijuana offenses.  \n\n     In October  1992, petitioner  filed  the instant  motion\n\nseeking to vacate the special parole terms.  From his reading\n\nof various amendments to 21  U.S.C.   841(b) that occurred in\n\nthe  mid-1980s, he  argued  that  the  statute  in  its  1987\n\nconfiguration imposed no type  of post-confinement monitoring\n\nfor the  offenses at issue  here.  He further  contended that\n\nthe district court was required to impose this allegedly more\n\n\"lenient\" penalty provision, rather than the one in effect at\n\nthe time the offenses occurred.   The district court properly\n\nrejected  this analysis.1  Contrary to petitioner's view, the\n\n1987  version of    841(b) actually contained  more stringent\n\npenalties, including enhanced  prison sentences and terms  of\n\nsupervised  release.  Applying  that provision  at sentencing\n\nthus  would have  violated  the  ex post  facto  clause.   We\n                                               \n\nexplain briefly.\n\n     The  various  modifications  that     841(b)   underwent\n\nbetween  1984  and  1987   have  been  exhaustively  detailed\n\nelsewhere,  see, e.g.,  Gozlon-Peretz v.  United States,  498\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district court did modify one aspect of the judgment\nsua sponte.   Pursuant to Bifulco v. United  States, 447 U.S.\n                                                   \n381 (1980),  it vacated the  special parole term  imposed for\nthe cocaine conspiracy count. \n\n                             -4-\n\nU.S.  395, 399-403 (1991); Padilla Palacios v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n932  F.2d 31,  32-33  (1st Cir.  1991)  (per curiam);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Ocasio  Figueroa, 898 F.2d  825, 826-28  (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1990), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1001 (1993); United States v.\n                                                          \n\nFerryman, 897 F.2d 584, 586-88 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 498\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 830 (1990), and so need only be summarized  here.  Prior\n\nto October 12,  1984,   841(b) mandated a  three-year term of\n\nspecial parole for cocaine  offenses and a two-year term  for\n\nmarijuana offenses.  Between that date  and October 27, 1986,\n\nan  anomalous  situation  existed.   The  statute  imposed no\n\nspecial  parole term  for  large-scale offenses  (e.g., those\n                                                      \n\ninvolving one kilogram or more of cocaine), but retained such\n\nsanctions  for  lesser   offenses.    Compare  21   U.S.C.   \n                                             \n\n841(b)(1)(A) (Supp.  1984) with id.    841(b)(1)(B)-(C); see,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United  States v.  Santamaria, 788  F.2d 824, 829  (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1986).   Finally,  it  is now  clear  that the  statute\n\nrequires  a term  of  supervised  release  for  all  offenses\n\noccurring on or after October 27, 1986 (not November 1, 1987,\n\nas  petitioner suggests).  See, e.g., Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 409; United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677, 686  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct.  1588 (1993).  Both the  1984\n                   \n\nand  1986 amendments,  of course,  also  enhanced the  prison\n\nterms prescribed by   841(b). \n\n     Defendant is therefore mistaken in maintaining  that the\n\nstatutory penalties existing  prior to October 12,  1984 were\n\n                             -5-\n\nmore  stringent than  those existing  in 1987.   Had  he been\n\nsentenced under  the latter,  he would  have been  exposed to\n\nlonger  terms of  imprisonment.2    And  he would  have  been\n\nsubject to periods  of supervised release at  least equal to,\n\nand  (depending on the  quantity of drugs  involved) possibly\n\nlonger  than, the  earlier special  parole  terms--a fact  he\n\noverlooks entirely.  It is thus clear that application of the\n\n1987 penalties would  have been impermissible.   And, lastly,\n\npetitioner's contention that  the circumstances  here are  so\n\nambiguous as to warrant invoking  the \"rule of lenity\" in his\n\nfavor is  well off the  mark.  See, e.g.,  Gozlon-Peretz, 498\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 409-10; Ferryman, 897 F.2d at 591.3 \n                        \n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant   suggests    this   would   have    posed   no\nconstitutional  difficulties  in  light of  the  government's\nsentencing  recommendations under  the  plea agreement.    He\nignores the fact that the  district court was not required to\naccept those recommendations.\n\n3.  While we  need not  address the issue,  we note  that the\nsecond prong of petitioner's argument--that any  reduction in\ncriminal penalties must be applied retroactively, even absent\nany  specific  provision  to  that  effect--appears   equally\nproblematic.  See generally United States v. Jacobs, 919 F.2d\n                                                   \n10 (3d Cir. 1990) (applying \"saving statute,\" 1 U.S.C.   109,\nto find change in drug offense classification, which occurred\nbetween time  of  offense and  time of  sentencing and  which\nwould  have  rendered   defendant  eligible  for   probation,\ninapplicable), cert. denied,  111 S. Ct. 1333  (1991); Lerner\n                                                             \nv. Gill,  751 F.2d  450, 456  (1st Cir.)  (rejecting argument\n       \nthat  \"a state  must  retroactively  afford  a  prisoner  the\nbenefits  of any less stringent legislation adopted after the\ncrime\"), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1010 (1985).  See also United\n                                                             \nStates v.  Tarvers,  833  F.2d 1068,  1077  (1st  Cir.  1987)\n                  \n(upholding special parole term imposed under pre-1984 version\nof   841(b), even though sentencing occurred in 1985).  \n\n                             -6-\n\n     The same reasoning applies to the two offenses here that\n\noccurred  after  October   12,  1984:  count  14   (involving\n\ndistribution of cocaine  on October 29,  1984), and count  15\n\n(involving possession of marijuana with intent to  distribute\n\non May 3, 1985).   The penalty provisions applicable to these\n\noffenses,  21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B)-(C)  (Supp.  1984), were\n\nless stringent than  those in effect in 1987.   Moreover, the\n\n1984 statute required special  parole in both instances.   Of\n\ncourse, had count  14 involved a kilogram or  more of cocaine\n\nand  thus  fallen  within  the  1984  version  of  subsection\n\n(b)(1)(A) rather than (b)(1)(B), no special parole would have\n\nbeen warranted with respect thereto.  Yet the district  court\n\nspecifically  determined that  this offense  was  governed by\n\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)  and petitioner has not  challenged this\n\nfinding on appeal.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -7-\n",

Prior\n\nto October 12,  1984,   841(b) mandated a  three-year term of\n\nspecial parole for cocaine  offenses and a two-year term  for\n\nmarijuana offenses.  Between that date  and October 27, 1986,\n\nan  anomalous  situation  existed.   The  statute  imposed no\n\nspecial  parole term  for  large-scale offenses  (e.g., those\n                                                      \n\ninvolving one kilogram or more of cocaine), but retained such\n\nsanctions  for  lesser   offenses.    Compare  21   U.S.C.   \n                                             \n\n841(b)(1)(A) (Supp.  1984) with id.    841(b)(1)(B)-(C); see,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United  States v.  Santamaria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468733\"><a href=\"/opinion/468733/united-states-v-juan-c-santamaria/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829  (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1986).   Finally,  it  is now  clear  that the  statute\n\nrequires  a term  of  supervised  release  for  all  offenses\n\noccurring on or after October 27, 1986 (not November 1, 1987,\n\nas  petitioner suggests).  See, e.g., Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 409; United States v. Morris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593170\"><a href=\"/opinion/593170/united-states-v-howard-morris-united-states-v-rafael-tormes-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 686  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>  <span class=\"page\">1588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).  Both the  1984\n                   \n\nand  1986 amendments,  of course,  also  enhanced the  prison\n\nterms prescribed by   841(b). \n\n     Defendant is therefore mistaken in maintaining  that the\n\nstatutory penalties existing  prior to October 12,  1984 were\n\n                             -5-\n\nmore  stringent than  those existing  in 1987.   Had  he been\n\nsentenced under  the latter,  he would  have been  exposed to\n\nlonger  terms of  imprisonment.2    And  he would  have  been\n\nsubject to periods  of supervised release at  least equal to,\n\nand  (depending on the  quantity of drugs  involved) possibly\n\nlonger  than, the  earlier special  parole  terms--a fact  he\n\noverlooks entirely.  It is thus clear that application of the\n\n1987 penalties would  have been impermissible.   And, lastly,\n\npetitioner's contention that  the circumstances  here are  so\n\nambiguous as to warrant invoking  the \"rule of lenity\" in his\n\nfavor is  well off the  mark.  See, e.g.,  Gozlon-Peretz, 498\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 409-10; Ferryman, 897 F.2d at 591.3 \n                        \n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant   suggests    this   would   have    posed   no\nconstitutional  difficulties  in  light of  the  government's\nsentencing  recommendations under  the  plea agreement.    He\nignores the fact that the  district court was not required to\naccept those recommendations.\n\n3.  While we  need not  address the issue,  we note  that the\nsecond prong of petitioner's argument--that any  reduction in\ncriminal penalties must be applied retroactively, even absent\nany  specific  provision  to  that  effect--appears   equally\nproblematic.

The penalty provisions applicable to these\n\noffenses,  21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B)-(C)  (Supp.  1984), were\n\nless stringent than  those in effect in 1987.   Moreover, the\n\n1984 statute required special  parole in both instances.   Of\n\ncourse, had count  14 involved a kilogram or  more of cocaine\n\nand  thus  fallen  within  the  1984  version  of  subsection\n\n(b)(1)(A) rather than (b)(1)(B), no special parole would have\n\nbeen warranted with respect thereto.  Yet the district  court\n\nspecifically  determined that  this offense  was  governed by\n\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)  and petitioner has not  challenged this\n\nfinding on appeal.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
