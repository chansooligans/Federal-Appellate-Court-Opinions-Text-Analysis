Damiani  Montalban\n\nappeals an order granting summary  judgment against him in a\n\nsuit brought under  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 29,    146  (1985).\n\nJurisdiction exists pursuant to 28  U.S.C.   1332(a)(1).  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n          In  accord  with  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56,  the  facts are\n\nconsidered in the light most favorable to the appellant.  On\n\nMarch  24, 1989, after nearly ten years of service at Puerto\n\nRico Marine Management, Inc. (PRMMI), Damiani was dismissed.\n\nAt the time  of his  dismissal, Damiani was  the Manager  of\n\nInsurance in PRMMI's Department of  Risk Management.  He was\n\n52 years old.\n\n          The   manner  in   which  Damiani   was  dismissed\n\nrepresents a  rather unceremonious conclusion to  his career\n\nat  PRMMI.  On Friday, March 10, 1989, Fernando L. Guardiola\n\nLopez, the Manager of  PRMMI's Department of Loss Prevention\n\ninformed Damiani that Victor Carreras, the Vice-President of\n\nIndustrial Relations  at PRMMI, had asked  Guardiola to tell\n\nthe appellant that  he would be  \"laid off\" effective  March\n\n24,  1989.  On Monday,  March 13, 1989,  the appellant asked\n\nhis supervisor,  Juan Jeannot  why he was  being terminated.\n\nJeannot  was unable  to provide  an explanation  for PRMMI's\n\naction.   Jeannot stated he  would look into  the matter and\n\nget  back  to Damiani.   By  letter,  dated March  13, 1989,\n\nEnrique    Gonzalez,    Vice-President   of    Finance   and\n\nAdministration  of PRMMI,  reiterated that  Damiani's layoff\n\nwould be effective March 24, 1989 and advised him to contact\n\nthe Personnel Department to review his benefits.  The letter\n\nconcluded  with  the  offer  to provide  references  to  aid\n\nDamiani  in finding a new position.  Although the exact date\n\nis unclear,  Damiani acknowledges receipt of  this letter no\n\nlater than March 22, 1989.\n\n                After  March  13,  1989,  Damiani  met  with\n\nRafael Reyes, PRMMI's Personnel Director.  Damiani  contends\n\nthat  Mr. Reyes first learned  of his layoff  the morning of\n\ntheir  meeting.  At this  meeting, Damiani again demanded an\n\nexplanation  for his  dismissal.   Reyes, however,  was also\n\nunaware of the reasons for Damiani's dismissal.\n\n               From the start,  Damiani maintained that  his\n\ndismissal was  unjustified  and continually  requested  that\n\nPRMMI provide  an explanation  for his  dismissal.   In each\n\nconversation  concerning  his  employment   status,  Damiani\n\nstated that  the dismissal action was  \"arbitrary and unfair\n\n                            -3-                                          3\n\nand  that  unless  I  was  retained I  would  file  whatever\n\njudicial  action  was necessary  to  protect  my rights  and\n\nobtain  redress  for any  damages  which  were going  to  be\n\nsubstantial  because  of  my   time  with  the  company,  my\n\nexcellent job execution and my age.\" \n\n          Damiani's last  day at  PRMMI was March  24, 1989.\n\nOn  July 24,  1989, he sent  a letter  to J.  P. Toomey, the\n\nPresident  of PRMMI.   In the  letter, Damiani  outlined his\n\ncontributions to the company and recommended PRMMI create an\n\nindependent  appeals   board  to  review  actions   such  as\n\npromotions, demotions,  and  dismissals.   Damiani  asserted\n\nthat an  impartial review of  his situation would  result in\n\nhis reinstatement.\n\n          On March  23, 1990, Damiani sued  PRMMI in federal\n\ndistrict  court invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  \n\n1332.  The  complaint asserted three  causes of action,  the\n\nfirst, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   185a (1989)(Law\n\n80), for  an additional month's salary  as indemnity because\n\nhe was  terminated from  his employment without  just cause,\n\nthe  second  for  monetary  damages  for age  discrimination\n\npursuant to P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 29,   146  (1985)(Law 100)1\n                                                     \n\n1 Section 146 provides in part:\n\"Any  employer  who  discharges, lays  off  or discriminates\nagainst an employee . . . on the basis of age . . . :\n\n                            -4-                                          4\n\n(  146 or Section 146), and  the third for money damages for\n\nmental  distress  because  of  his  discriminatory discharge\n\nbased on  age.  (Complaint at  5-7.)  In the  portion of his\n\ncomplaint entitled  \"Request for Remedy\" he  alleged that he\n\nhad  suffered  injury  \"caused  by   the  willful,  illegal,\n\ndiscriminatory  and/or negligent  actions of  the defendant\"\n\nand sought  front pay  in lieu  of reinstatement, back  pay,\n\nlost benefits,  damages for  pain  and suffering,  severance\n\npay, double payment of  all sums as double indemnity,  costs\n\nand attorneys fees, prejudgment  interest and any other just\n\nrelief  which plaintiff estimated to equal not less than two\n\nmillion    three    thousand    eight     hundred    dollars\n\n($2,003,800.00).   On August 31, 1991, PRMMI  filed a motion\n\nfor  summary   judgment   contending  that   Damiani's   age\n\ndiscrimination  claim   was  barred   by   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations  and that the amount  of Damiani's Law 80 claim,\n\nstanding alone,  was insufficient  to supply the  court with\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1332.  PRMMI's\n\nmotion  did  not address  Damiani's  third  claim for  money\n\ndamages for mental anguish  because of his termination based\n\n                                                     \n\n(a) shall incur civil liability\n(1) for a sum equal to twice the amount of damages sustained\nby the  employee or applicant  for employment on  account of\nsuch action;\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   146 (1985).\n\n                            -5-                                          5\n\non  age.   That  cause  of  action,  based  on  alleged  age\n\ndiscrimination, would also be  time barred.  We see  no need\n\nto return this  matter to the district court to do what must\n\nbe done, that is  to dismiss Count III.  The  district court\n\ngranted the motion  as to Counts I and  II.  Damiani appeals\n\nthat  judgment.     Damiani, in  his  brief, states  that no\n\nappeal  is  taken from  the  determination that  his  Law 80\n\nclaim, alone, does not meet the jurisdictional amount. \n\n                      II. Discussion \n\n          Summary  judgment is  appropriate when  the record\n\nreflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . .\n\nthe  moving party  is entitled  to judgment  as a  matter of\n\nlaw.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  In certain cases, Rule 56 may be\n\nused  to determine whether a statutory time bar applies to a\n\nparticular  set of facts.   See, e.g., Jensen  v. Frank, 912                                                                    \n\nF.2d  517, 520 (1st Cir.  1990); Kali Seafood,  Inc. v. Howe                                                                         \n\nCorp.,  887 F.2d 7,  9 (1st Cir.  1989).  At  the outset, we                  \n\nnote  that  the review  of a  grant  of summary  judgment is\n\nplenary.  Garside v.  Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d  46, 49 (1st                                                  \n\nCir. 1990).   In the  present case, our  inquiry focuses  on\n\nwhether the record  reveals a genuine issue  of any material\n\nfact relative to the timeliness of Damiani's suit.  Doyle v.                                                                         \n\nShubs,  905 F.2d  1 (1st  Cir. 1990)(per  curiam).   Damiani                  \n\n                            -6-                                          6\n\ncontends that the  time of accrual of his action  as well as\n\nwhether the action was  tolled under the law of  Puerto Rico\n\nconstitute genuine issues of material fact.\n\n          In  Olmo  v. Young  &amp;  Ribicam of  P.R.,  Inc., 10                                                                     \n\nOfficial Translations  of the Opinions of  the Supreme Court\n\nof  Puerto Rico 967 (1981), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\n\naddressed  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations  for an\n\naction  brought under   146.  In Olmo, the plaintiff brought                                                  \n\nan  action  under    146  alleging  he  had  been discharged\n\nbecause of  his race.   Since the statute did  not provide a\n\nspecific limitation  period, the Olmo court  determined that                                                  \n\nthe one  year statute  of limitations   applicable  to other\n\ncivil actions for damages based on racial discrimination was\n\nappropriate for an action under   146.  Id. at 972-73.                                                        \n\n          The Olmo court  described actions brought  under                                 \n\n146  as actions for \"tortious  discrimination.\"  Id. at 972.                                                                 \n\nThat   description  is   instructive  in   determining  when\n\nDamiani's  action  accrued.    Under Puerto  Rico  law,  all\n\nactions for civil liability based on fault or negligence are\n\ntime  barred after  one year  \"from  the time  the aggrieved\n\nperson  had knowledge thereof.\"   P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 31,  \n\n5298 (1991).  In  the instant case, the district  court held\n\n                            -7-                                          7\n\nthat Damiani's cause  of action accrued  on March 10,  1989,\n\nthe date he was informed of his termination.  We agree.\n\n          The  Supreme Court  of Puerto  Rico has  addressed\n\nwhen an  action for wrongful discharge accrues.   In Delgado                                                                         \n\nRodriguez v. Nazario de Ferrer, 121 D.P.R.    , 88 J.T.S. 63                                           \n\n(No. CE-86-417, official  translation) (1988), the plaintiff\n\nwas informed on March  19, 1981 that he would  be terminated\n\neffective  April 15, 1981.   Before  he was  terminated, the\n\nplaintiff initiated an administrative  claim with the  Board\n\nof Appeals of the Personnel Administration System.  On March\n\n7, 1984 the Board  of Appeals reinstated the plaintiff.   On\n\nMarch 1,  1985, the plaintiff  filed a civil  action seeking\n\ndamages  for wrongful  termination.   The  Supreme Court  of\n\nPuerto Rico determined that the statute of limitations began\n\nto  run when the aggrieved party became aware of the damage.\n\nThe Delgado  Rodriguez court determined that the plaintiff's                                   \n\ncause of action was  time barred because it accrued  the day\n\nhe  received notice of his termination, March 19, 1981.  Id.                                                                         \n\nat 11 (No. CE-86-417, slip op. at 11).\n\n          A  similar analysis has  been applied  in wrongful\n\ntermination  cases  brought under  42  U.S.C.    1983.    In\n\nRivera-Muriente   v.  Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d  349 (1st Cir.                                                \n\n1992), the plaintiff was informed  that his name was removed\n\n                            -8-                                          8\n\nfrom an employment roster.   Two years later,  the plaintiff\n\nfiled  an action  in federal  court alleging  his employer's\n\nactions had deprived him of  property without due process of\n\nlaw.  The Rivera-Muriente court stated that:                                      \n\n               [i]n    employment    discrimination    cases\ninvolving wrongful       discharges,    the    statute    of\n                         limitations begins to run  when the\n                         plaintiff learns of the decision to\n                         terminate  his employment  (even if\n                         the    notice   he    receives   is\n                         informal).\n\nId. at 353.   In determining when Damiani's action  accrued,                \n\nour inquiry is  when did  Damiani become aware  he would  be\n\nterminated?   Damiani argues that Guardiola's  statement did\n\nnot  commence the  running  of the  statute of  limitations.\n\nDamiani contends that a fellow manager could not provide the\n\nrequisite  notice  of his  dismissal.    In Damiani's  view,\n\nGuardiola's  statement  fails  to  trigger  the  statute  of\n\nlimitations  because it  amounts  to  mere  speculation  and\n\nrumor.   This contention  fails, however, when  the facts of\n\nthe  notice are analyzed.   In an affidavit  attached to his\n\nopposition  to  the  motion  for summary  judgment,  Damiani\n\nadmits that Guardiola stated he was acting under orders from\n\nVictor Carreras,  Vice-President of Industrial  Relations at\n\nPRMMI.    Thus,  Guardiola  was dispatched  to  deliver  the\n\nunfortunate  news by a superior.   This action  was not mere\n\n                            -9-                                          9\n\ngossip or speculation, but a sanctioned delegation of duties\n\nby PRMMI's administration.  Although Damiani felt the use of\n\nGuardiola as a messenger was not appropriate, it effectively\n\nconveyed notice to Damiani that he would be terminated.\n\n          Damiani further argues that  Guardiola's statement\n\ndid not  effectively  provide notice  of  dismissal  because\n\nGuardiola was unaware of the reasons for PRMMI's action.  As\n\nwe  have  noted,  in cases  such  as  this,  the statute  of\n\nlimitations begins to run when the aggrieved party learns of\n\nthe decision  to terminate  him. Rivera-Muriente  v. Agosto-                                                                         \n\nAlicea, 959 F.2d at  353.  An employer's failure  or refusal                   \n\nto  provide  an  aggrieved  employee with  the  reasons  for\n\ntermination has no effect on the commencement of the statute\n\nof  limitations.  The date an employee becomes aware that he\n\nhas  been damaged by a  decision to terminate,  his cause of\n\naction  begins and the longevity  of that claim for purposes\n\nof the statute of  limitations is set.   On March 10,  1989,\n\nDamiani became aware that  he would be terminated, therefore\n\nthe  statute of limitations for any claim of damages under  \n\n146 then began to run.\n\n          Damiani next contends  that his conversations with\n\nvarious  PRMMI  personnel  constitute  extrajudicial  claims\n\nsufficient to toll  the statute of limitations.   Tolling of\n\n                            -10-                                          10\n\nthe statute of limitations is provided for in P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31,    5303  (1991)  (  5303  or Section  5303).   That\n\nsection states:\n\n          [p]rescription  of actions is interrupted by their\n          institution  before  the courts,  by extrajudicial\n          claim  of   the  creditor,  and  by   any  act  of\n          acknowledgement of the debt by the debtor.\n\nP.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 31,    5303.  The district  court noted\n\nthat Damiani  relied principally  on his letter,  dated July\n\n26, 1989, as  evidence of an  extrajudicial claim.   Damiani                                                                         \n\nMontalban v.  Puerto Rico  Marine Management, Inc.,  No. 90-                                                               \n\n1426, slip op. at 6 (D.P.R. Sept. 18, 1991).  In this forum,\n\nhowever, he  relies exclusively  on  his oral  conversations\n\nwith PRMMI personnel.  \n\n          Under    5303, the  statute of limitations  may be\n\ninterrupted  by  the  \"unequivocal  statement  of  one  who,\n\nthreatened  with the loss  of his right,  expresses his will\n\nnot to  lose it.\"  Feliciano  v. A.J.A., 93  P.R.R. 638, 643                                                    \n\n(1966).  The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has noted that the\n\ntolling  exception to  the  statute of  limitations must  be\n\ninterpreted restrictively.   Diaz de Diana  v. A.J.A.S. Ins.                                                                         \n\nCo., 10 Official Translations of the Opinions of the Supreme                \n\nCourt of Puerto Rico 604, 607-608, n. 1 (1980).  In order to\n\ntoll the statute  of limitations,  the extrajudicial  claims\n\nmust be precise and specific.  Jimenez v. District Court, 65                                                                     \n\n                            -11-                                          11\n\nP.R.R.  35, 42 (1945).   The purpose of  requiring a precise\n\nand  specific claim is to alert the defendant of claims that\n\nwould otherwise lapse. \n\n          In Riofrio  Anda v. Ralston Purina,  Co., 959 F.2d                                                               \n\n1149  (1st Cir. 1992), the plaintiff was hired under an oral\n\ncontract.   After his  termination, the plaintiff negotiated\n\nwith  his employer  concerning  relocation  and  termination\n\ncompensation which  he claimed  was required under  his oral\n\nagreement.   His attorney wrote  to the employer  and stated\n\nhis  intention to  \"file  an  unlawful discharge  complaint\"\n\nagainst the employer.  The plaintiff then filed an action in\n\nthe United States District Court  for the District of Puerto\n\nRico  seeking money  damages for breach  of his  contract of\n\nemployment  with  respect  to  remuneration  and  relocation\n\nexpenses, wrongful  discharge and unlawful  termination, and\n\nmental  pain  and  suffering  resulting  from  willful  acts\n\ncommitted  by the defendants at the time of termination.  We\n\nheld that the attorney's  letter was inadequate to toll  the\n\nstatute  of  limitations because  the  letter  did not  give\n\ndefendant \"fair  notice that  a lawsuit based  on breach  of\n\ncontract  and  wrongful  discharge  were  in  the   offing.\"\n\nRiofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., 959 F.2d at 1154.                                                \n\n                            -12-                                          12\n\n          In addition, tolling  requires that the  plaintiff\n\nmust  claim the same relief  that is later  requested in the\n\nsuit.   Hernandez Del Valle  v. Santa Aponte,  575 F.2d 321,                                                         \n\n323-24 (1st Cir. 1978).  In Del  Valle, the plaintiff sent a                                                   \n\nletter contending that his dismissal was illegal and seeking\n\nreinstatement.   The court held  that the  letter failed  to\n\ntoll  the statute  of limitations  for a    1983  action for\n\nunlawful  discharge which sought  reinstatement and damages.\n\nThe  court  emphasized  that   the  letter  indicated   that\n\nplaintiff's  sole  interest  was reemployment.    The  court\n\nreasoned  that the letter failed to give the defendant \"fair\n\nnotice that he would be called upon to defend a damages suit\n\nwith  different   issues  not  applicable  to   a  suit  for\n\ninjunctive relief.\"  Id. at 324.  Similarly, in Riofrio Anda                                                                         \n\nv.  Ralston Purina  Co.,  this court  applied Del  Valle, by                                                                     \n\nemphasizing  that  to  effectively   toll  the  statute   of\n\nlimitations  an extrajudicial  claim must  request the  same\n\nrelief ultimately sought in a federal suit.  Ralston Anda v.                                                                         \n\nRalston  Purina  Co., 959  F.2d at  1154.   An extrajudicial                                 \n\nclaim does  not  toll the  statute  of limitations  for  all\n\nclaims  arising out of the  same facts.   Rather, tolling is\n\neffective only  with regard  to identical causes  of action.\n\n                            -13-                                          13\n\nRodriguez  Narvaez  v. Nazario,  895 F.2d  38, 43  (1st Cir.                                           \n\n1990).\n\n          In  the present  case,  Damiani's statements  seek\n\nretention as  an employee  while alluding to  possible legal\n\naction.  His complaint, however,  seeks a variety of damages\n\nincluding  damages  in  lieu  of  reinstatement.   Damiani's\n\nstatement can not be deemed a precise and specific claim for\n\nrelief  ultimately  sought  in  his lawsuit.    His  cryptic\n\ncomment  suggesting that  his damages  would  be substantial\n\nbecause  of his age did  not provide PRMMI  with fair notice\n\nthat  it would  be  called upon  to  defend a  suit  seeking\n\ndamages resulting from age discrimination. \n\n          Damiani's final  argument is that a  decision of a\n\nmore recent  vintage from the  Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico\n\nmodified  tolling  requirements.     As  support   for  this\n\nproposition,  Damiani  points   to  Zambrana  Maldonado   v.                                                                         \n\nCommonwealth  of Puerto Rico,  130 D.P.R.    , 92  J.T.S. 12                                         \n\n(1992)(Translation  Provided).   In Zambrana  Maldonado, the                                                                    \n\nplaintiff sent a letter to the Secretary of Justice alleging\n\nhe  had a  claim for  damages against  the government.   The\n\nplaintiff's  letter   stated  that  he   was  notifying  the\n\ngovernment of a claim and provided the date, place,  damages\n\nsuffered,  the  cause  and  nature thereof  and  a  list  of\n\n                            -14-                                          14\n\npossible  witnesses.  Id. at 15.   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,                                        \n\n3077a (1968) (Section 3077a) requires a claimant against the\n\ngovernment to give  notice of the claim  including the date,\n\nplace, cause and general nature of the damages suffered, the\n\nnames of witnesses,  the address of the claimant as well  as\n\nthe  place where  medical treatment  was received.   Section\n\n3077a requires that  such notice be given within ninety (90)\n\ndays  of the awareness of  the damages.   Failure to provide\n\nnotice  within the ninety day period bars a suit against the\n\ngovernment. The Supreme Court  of Puerto Rico held  that the\n\nplaintiff's  written claim  of damage  tolled the  statue of\n\nlimitations.  Zambrana Maldonado  v. Commonwealth  of Puerto                                                                         \n\nRico  (translation at  35).   The  Zambrana Maldonado  court                                                                  \n\nmaintained  that   the  interruption  of   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations   requires  \"conduct  in  which,  more  or  less\n\ntractably and  more or  less categorically or  urgently, the\n\ndecision to obtain payment is shown.\"  Id. at 23.  The court                                                       \n\nheld  that the  notice which  complied with the  statute was\n\nsufficient  to  toll the  statute of  limitations. Plaintiff\n\npoints  to language in the court's opinion which states that\n\nthe  law does not require any particular form of notice. The\n\ncourt  observed that \"[n]o matter  how the claim  is made it\n\nhas  interruptive  value...\"   Id.    In this  context,  the                                               \n\n                            -15-                                          15\n\nopinion cannot be read as a broadening of the type of notice\n\nrequired.   The issue is not  the form of the  notice, it is\n\nthe content of the  notice.  Here, the content  is deficient\n\nto  support  the  legal   action  which  has  been  brought.\n\nDamiani's statements did not  evidence an urgent decision to\n\nobtain payment for damages under   146.\n\n                      III. Conclusion                                                  \n\n          Damiani's  statements did  not toll  the  one year\n\nstatute of \n\nlimitations.  Dismissal was required as a matter of law.\n\nAffirmed.                      \n\n                            -16-                                          16\n",

Damiani  Montalban\n\nappeals an order granting summary  judgment against him in a\n\nsuit brought under  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 29,    146  (1985).\n\nJurisdiction exists pursuant to 28  U.S.C.   1332(a)(1).  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n          In  accord  with  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56,  the  facts are\n\nconsidered in the light most favorable to the appellant.  On\n\nMarch  24, 1989, after nearly ten years of service at Puerto\n\nRico Marine Management, Inc. (PRMMI), Damiani was dismissed.\n\nAt the time  of his  dismissal, Damiani was  the Manager  of\n\nInsurance in PRMMI's Department of  Risk Management.  He was\n\n52 years old.\n\n          The   manner  in   which  Damiani   was  dismissed\n\nrepresents a  rather unceremonious conclusion to  his career\n\nat  PRMMI.  On Friday, March 10, 1989, Fernando L. Guardiola\n\nLopez, the Manager of  PRMMI's Department of Loss Prevention\n\ninformed Damiani that Victor Carreras, the Vice-President of\n\nIndustrial Relations  at PRMMI, had asked  Guardiola to tell\n\nthe appellant that  he would be  \"laid off\" effective  March\n\n24,  1989.  On Monday,  March 13, 1989,  the appellant asked\n\nhis supervisor,  Juan Jeannot  why he was  being terminated.\n\nJeannot  was unable  to provide  an explanation  for PRMMI's\n\naction.   Jeannot stated he  would look into  the matter and\n\nget  back  to Damiani.   By  letter,  dated March  13, 1989,\n\nEnrique    Gonzalez,    Vice-President   of    Finance   and\n\nAdministration  of PRMMI,  reiterated that  Damiani's layoff\n\nwould be effective March 24, 1989 and advised him to contact\n\nthe Personnel Department to review his benefits.  The letter\n\nconcluded  with  the  offer  to provide  references  to  aid\n\nDamiani  in finding a new position.  Although the exact date\n\nis unclear,  Damiani acknowledges receipt of  this letter no\n\nlater than March 22, 1989.\n\n                After  March  13,  1989,  Damiani  met  with\n\nRafael Reyes, PRMMI's Personnel Director.  Damiani  contends\n\nthat  Mr. Reyes first learned  of his layoff  the morning of\n\ntheir  meeting.  At this  meeting, Damiani again demanded an\n\nexplanation  for his  dismissal.   Reyes, however,  was also\n\nunaware of the reasons for Damiani's dismissal.\n\n               From the start,  Damiani maintained that  his\n\ndismissal was  unjustified  and continually  requested  that\n\nPRMMI provide  an explanation  for his  dismissal.   In each\n\nconversation  concerning  his  employment   status,  Damiani\n\nstated that  the dismissal action was  \"arbitrary and unfair\n\n                            -3-                                          3\n\nand  that  unless  I  was  retained I  would  file  whatever\n\njudicial  action  was necessary  to  protect  my rights  and\n\nobtain  redress  for any  damages  which  were going  to  be\n\nsubstantial  because  of  my   time  with  the  company,  my\n\nexcellent job execution and my age.\" \n\n          Damiani's last  day at  PRMMI was March  24, 1989.\n\nOn  July 24,  1989, he sent  a letter  to J.  P. Toomey, the\n\nPresident  of PRMMI.   In the  letter, Damiani  outlined his\n\ncontributions to the company and recommended PRMMI create an\n\nindependent  appeals   board  to  review  actions   such  as\n\npromotions, demotions,  and  dismissals.   Damiani  asserted\n\nthat an  impartial review of  his situation would  result in\n\nhis reinstatement.\n\n          On March  23, 1990, Damiani sued  PRMMI in federal\n\ndistrict  court invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  \n\n1332.  The  complaint asserted three  causes of action,  the\n\nfirst, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   185a (1989)(Law\n\n80), for  an additional month's salary  as indemnity because\n\nhe was  terminated from  his employment without  just cause,\n\nthe  second  for  monetary  damages  for age  discrimination\n\npursuant to P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 29,   146  (1985)(Law 100)1\n                                                     \n\n1 Section 146 provides in part:\n\"Any  employer  who  discharges, lays  off  or discriminates\nagainst an employee . . . on the basis of age . . . :\n\n                            -4-                                          4\n\n(  146 or Section 146), and  the third for money damages for\n\nmental  distress  because  of  his  discriminatory discharge\n\nbased on  age.  (Complaint at  5-7.)  In the  portion of his\n\ncomplaint entitled  \"Request for Remedy\" he  alleged that he\n\nhad  suffered  injury  \"caused  by   the  willful,  illegal,\n\ndiscriminatory  and/or negligent  actions of  the defendant\"\n\nand sought  front pay  in lieu  of reinstatement, back  pay,\n\nlost benefits,  damages for  pain  and suffering,  severance\n\npay, double payment of  all sums as double indemnity,  costs\n\nand attorneys fees, prejudgment  interest and any other just\n\nrelief  which plaintiff estimated to equal not less than two\n\nmillion    three    thousand    eight     hundred    dollars\n\n($2,003,800.00).   On August 31, 1991, PRMMI  filed a motion\n\nfor  summary   judgment   contending  that   Damiani's   age\n\ndiscrimination  claim   was  barred   by   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations  and that the amount  of Damiani's Law 80 claim,\n\nstanding alone,  was insufficient  to supply the  court with\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1332.  PRMMI's\n\nmotion  did  not address  Damiani's  third  claim for  money\n\ndamages for mental anguish  because of his termination based\n\n                                                     \n\n(a) shall incur civil liability\n(1) for a sum equal to twice the amount of damages sustained\nby the  employee or applicant  for employment on  account of\nsuch action;\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   146 (1985).\n\n                            -5-                                          5\n\non  age.   That  cause  of  action,  based  on  alleged  age\n\ndiscrimination, would also be  time barred.  We see  no need\n\nto return this  matter to the district court to do what must\n\nbe done, that is  to dismiss Count III.  The  district court\n\ngranted the motion  as to Counts I and  II.  Damiani appeals\n\nthat  judgment.     Damiani, in  his  brief, states  that no\n\nappeal  is  taken from  the  determination that  his  Law 80\n\nclaim, alone, does not meet the jurisdictional amount. \n\n                      II.

Young  &amp;  Ribicam of  P.R.,  Inc., 10                                                                     \n\nOfficial Translations  of the Opinions of  the Supreme Court\n\nof  Puerto Rico 967 (1981), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\n\naddressed  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations  for an\n\naction  brought under   146.  In Olmo, the plaintiff brought                                                  \n\nan  action  under    146  alleging  he  had  been discharged\n\nbecause of  his race.   Since the statute did  not provide a\n\nspecific limitation  period, the Olmo court  determined that                                                  \n\nthe one  year statute  of limitations   applicable  to other\n\ncivil actions for damages based on racial discrimination was\n\nappropriate for an action under   146.  Id. at 972-73.                                                        \n\n          The Olmo court  described actions brought  under                                 \n\n146  as actions for \"tortious  discrimination.\"  Id. at 972.                                                                 \n\nThat   description  is   instructive  in   determining  when\n\nDamiani's  action  accrued.    Under Puerto  Rico  law,  all\n\nactions for civil liability based on fault or negligence are\n\ntime  barred after  one year  \"from  the time  the aggrieved\n\nperson  had knowledge thereof.\"   P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 31,  \n\n5298 (1991).  In  the instant case, the district  court held\n\n                            -7-                                          7\n\nthat Damiani's cause  of action accrued  on March 10,  1989,\n\nthe date he was informed of his termination.  We agree.\n\n          The  Supreme Court  of Puerto  Rico has  addressed\n\nwhen an  action for wrongful discharge accrues.   In Delgado                                                                         \n\nRodriguez v. Nazario de Ferrer, 121 D.P.R.    , 88 J.T.S. 63                                           \n\n(No. CE-86-417, official  translation) (1988), the plaintiff\n\nwas informed on March  19, 1981 that he would  be terminated\n\neffective  April 15, 1981.   Before  he was  terminated, the\n\nplaintiff initiated an administrative  claim with the  Board\n\nof Appeals of the Personnel Administration System.  On March\n\n7, 1984 the Board  of Appeals reinstated the plaintiff.   On\n\nMarch 1,  1985, the plaintiff  filed a civil  action seeking\n\ndamages  for wrongful  termination.   The  Supreme Court  of\n\nPuerto Rico determined that the statute of limitations began\n\nto  run when the aggrieved party became aware of the damage.\n\nThe Delgado  Rodriguez court determined that the plaintiff's                                   \n\ncause of action was  time barred because it accrued  the day\n\nhe  received notice of his termination, March 19, 1981.

Agosto-Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.                                                \n\n1992), the plaintiff was informed  that his name was removed\n\n                            -8-                                          8\n\nfrom an employment roster.   Two years later,  the plaintiff\n\nfiled  an action  in federal  court alleging  his employer's\n\nactions had deprived him of  property without due process of\n\nlaw.  The Rivera-Muriente court stated that:                                      \n\n               [i]n    employment    discrimination    cases\ninvolving wrongful       discharges,    the    statute    of\n                         limitations begins to run  when the\n                         plaintiff learns of the decision to\n                         terminate  his employment  (even if\n                         the    notice   he    receives   is\n                         informal).\n\nId. at 353.   In determining when Damiani's action  accrued,                \n\nour inquiry is  when did  Damiani become aware  he would  be\n\nterminated?   Damiani argues that Guardiola's  statement did\n\nnot  commence the  running  of the  statute of  limitations.\n\nDamiani contends that a fellow manager could not provide the\n\nrequisite  notice  of his  dismissal.    In Damiani's  view,\n\nGuardiola's  statement  fails  to  trigger  the  statute  of\n\nlimitations  because it  amounts  to  mere  speculation  and\n\nrumor.   This contention  fails, however, when  the facts of\n\nthe  notice are analyzed.   In an affidavit  attached to his\n\nopposition  to  the  motion  for summary  judgment,  Damiani\n\nadmits that Guardiola stated he was acting under orders from\n\nVictor Carreras,  Vice-President of Industrial  Relations at\n\nPRMMI.    Thus,  Guardiola  was dispatched  to  deliver  the\n\nunfortunate  news by a superior.   This action  was not mere\n\n                            -9-                                          9\n\ngossip or speculation, but a sanctioned delegation of duties\n\nby PRMMI's administration.  Although Damiani felt the use of\n\nGuardiola as a messenger was not appropriate, it effectively\n\nconveyed notice to Damiani that he would be terminated.\n\n          Damiani further argues that  Guardiola's statement\n\ndid not  effectively  provide notice  of  dismissal  because\n\nGuardiola was unaware of the reasons for PRMMI's action.  As\n\nwe  have  noted,  in cases  such  as  this,  the statute  of\n\nlimitations begins to run when the aggrieved party learns of\n\nthe decision  to terminate  him. Rivera-Muriente  v. Agosto-                                                                         \n\nAlicea, 959 F.2d at  353.  An employer's failure  or refusal                   \n\nto  provide  an  aggrieved  employee with  the  reasons  for\n\ntermination has no effect on the commencement of the statute\n\nof  limitations.  The date an employee becomes aware that he\n\nhas  been damaged by a  decision to terminate,  his cause of\n\naction  begins and the longevity  of that claim for purposes\n\nof the statute of  limitations is set.   On March 10,  1989,\n\nDamiani became aware that  he would be terminated, therefore\n\nthe  statute of limitations for any claim of damages under  \n\n146 then began to run.\n\n          Damiani next contends  that his conversations with\n\nvarious  PRMMI  personnel  constitute  extrajudicial  claims\n\nsufficient to toll  the statute of limitations.   Tolling of\n\n                            -10-                                          10\n\nthe statute of limitations is provided for in P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 31,    5303  (1991)  (  5303  or Section  5303).   That\n\nsection states:\n\n          [p]rescription  of actions is interrupted by their\n          institution  before  the courts,  by extrajudicial\n          claim  of   the  creditor,  and  by   any  act  of\n          acknowledgement of the debt by the debtor.\n\nP.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 31,    5303.  The district  court noted\n\nthat Damiani  relied principally  on his letter,  dated July\n\n26, 1989, as  evidence of an  extrajudicial claim.   Damiani                                                                         \n\nMontalban v.

In this forum,\n\nhowever, he  relies exclusively  on  his oral  conversations\n\nwith PRMMI personnel.  \n\n          Under    5303, the  statute of limitations  may be\n\ninterrupted  by  the  \"unequivocal  statement  of  one  who,\n\nthreatened  with the loss  of his right,  expresses his will\n\nnot to  lose it.\"  Feliciano  v.

His  cryptic\n\ncomment  suggesting that  his damages  would  be substantial\n\nbecause  of his age did  not provide PRMMI  with fair notice\n\nthat  it would  be  called upon  to  defend a  suit  seeking\n\ndamages resulting from age discrimination. \n\n          Damiani's final  argument is that a  decision of a\n\nmore recent  vintage from the  Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico\n\nmodified  tolling  requirements.     As  support   for  this\n\nproposition,  Damiani  points   to  Zambrana  Maldonado   v.                                                                         \n\nCommonwealth  of Puerto Rico,  130 D.P.R.    , 92  J.T.S. 12                                         \n\n(1992)(Translation  Provided).   In Zambrana  Maldonado, the                                                                    \n\nplaintiff sent a letter to the Secretary of Justice alleging\n\nhe  had a  claim for  damages against  the government.   The\n\nplaintiff's  letter   stated  that  he   was  notifying  the\n\ngovernment of a claim and provided the date, place,  damages\n\nsuffered,  the  cause  and  nature thereof  and  a  list  of\n\n                            -14-                                          14\n\npossible  witnesses.  Id. at 15.   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,                                        \n\n3077a (1968) (Section 3077a) requires a claimant against the\n\ngovernment to give  notice of the claim  including the date,\n\nplace, cause and general nature of the damages suffered, the\n\nnames of witnesses,  the address of the claimant as well  as\n\nthe  place where  medical treatment  was received.   Section\n\n3077a requires that  such notice be given within ninety (90)\n\ndays  of the awareness of  the damages.   Failure to provide\n\nnotice  within the ninety day period bars a suit against the\n\ngovernment. The Supreme Court  of Puerto Rico held  that the\n\nplaintiff's  written claim  of damage  tolled the  statue of\n\nlimitations.  Zambrana Maldonado  v. Commonwealth  of Puerto                                                                         \n\nRico  (translation at  35).   The  Zambrana Maldonado  court                                                                  \n\nmaintained  that   the  interruption  of   the  statute   of\n\nlimitations   requires  \"conduct  in  which,  more  or  less\n\ntractably and  more or  less categorically or  urgently, the\n\ndecision to obtain payment is shown.\"  Id. at 23.  The court                                                       \n\nheld  that the  notice which  complied with the  statute was\n\nsufficient  to  toll the  statute of  limitations. Plaintiff\n\npoints  to language in the court's opinion which states that\n\nthe  law does not require any particular form of notice. The\n\ncourt  observed that \"[n]o matter  how the claim  is made it\n\nhas  interruptive  value...\"   Id.    In this  context,  the                                               \n\n                            -15-                                          15\n\nopinion cannot be read as a broadening of the type of notice\n\nrequired.   The issue is not  the form of the  notice, it is\n\nthe content of the  notice.  Here, the content  is deficient\n\nto  support  the  legal   action  which  has  been  brought.\n\nDamiani's statements did not  evidence an urgent decision to\n\nobtain payment for damages under   146.\n\n                      III. Conclusion                                                  \n\n          Damiani's  statements did  not toll  the  one year\n\nstatute of \n\nlimitations.  Dismissal was required as a matter of law.\n\nAffirmed.                      \n\n                            -16-                                          16\n</pre>",
