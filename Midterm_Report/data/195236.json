See United States v. Welch,      F.3d    ,\n                                                 \n\n   , No. 92-1368  (1st Cir. Dec. 30, 1993,  slip op. at 19).   In\n\n1992, Hahn and ten other  defendants were jointly indicted in the\n\nUnited  States District Court for  the District of New Hampshire,\n\nas former members of a nationwide marijuana trafficking conspira-\n\ncy spanning  more than a decade  and headed by one  Alberto \"Dad\"\n\nLujan.  As a principal  underboss, Hahn had been responsible for,\n\ninter alia, transporting smuggled  Mexican marijuana from Arizona\n          \n\nfor  distribution  in California,  Colorado, Michigan,  New Hamp-\n\nshire, Massachusetts and New York, among other locales.\n\n          In the early 1980s, Hahn and Lujan were local marijuana\n\ndealers seeking to penetrate marijuana markets outside Arizona in\n\norder  to capitalize  on  their  connections  with  suppliers  in\n\nMexico.   Eventually,  Hahn established  a business  relationship\n\n                                2\n\nwith  Mark  Heino, a  New  Hampshire  native living  in  southern\n\nCalifornia.   Some of  the marijuana Heino  bought from  Hahn, he\n\nresold  in California.   The  rest Heino  distributed  during his\n\nfrequent trips to New Hampshire.   Heino himself became an under-\n\nboss in the Lujan organization,  a position he retained until his\n\narrest on trafficking charges in early 1984.\n\n          With  Heino  out  of  circulation,  the  New  Hampshire\n\noperation was taken over by  Hugh Mulligan, another New Hampshire\n\nnative.  Like  Heino, Mulligan had been recruited  into the Lujan\n\norganization by  Hahn, who  thereafter supervised  Mulligan's New\n\nHampshire operation.   Later,  when the  New Hampshire  marijuana\n\nmarket  softened, Mulligan  introduced Hahn  to  Dennis and  P.J.\n\nDougherty,  Long Island residents  with New Hampshire  ties.  The\n\nDoughertys afforded the  Lujan organization access to  the lucra-\n\ntive  Metropolitan New York marijuana market, and large marijuana\n\nshipments were soon being trucked in from Arizona.  Several years\n\nlater,  after the  Doughertys dropped  out of  the picture,  Hahn\n\nestablished a high-volume  marijuana trade with another  New York\n\ndealer.   Meantime, Heino was  released from prison  in mid-1986,\n\nreturned to New Hampshire, and reestablished himself in the Lujan\n\norganization.    During  this period,  Hahn  concentrated  on the\n\norganization's interests in Arizona,  Metropolitan New York,  and\n\nNew Hampshire.\n\n                                3\n\n          Hahn's primary  role was  to supervise marijuana  ship-\n\nments from Arizona  to New York and New England.1  In early 1991,\n\nLujan set  up a bogus  produce-trucking operation as a  cover for\n\nthe marijuana shipments.  A professional truck  driver, one Roger\n\nBradley, was recruited for the long-haul runs between Arizona and\n\nthe  Northeast.   Upon  arrival  at his  East  Coast destination,\n\nBradley  would contact Hahn to arrange for offloading.  Normally,\n\nBradley  would \"deadhead\"  back to  Arizona, but  on occasion  he\n\ntransported large quantities of currency back to Lujan at  Hahn's\n\nrequest.2\n\n          The cross-country trucking operation was a success.  At\n\nits  apex, during 1991 alone, thirteen to fifteen tractor-trailer\n\nloads were transported from Arizona to the Northeast under Hahn's\n\n                    \n\n     1Hahn's secondary role  was to  ensure the  security of  the\norganization's  marijuana supply in  Arizona.   Several witnesses\ntestified  that Hahn  almost always  carried  a .45  caliber Colt\nCommander handgun.  Coconspirator Michael Sheehan testified  that\nHahn admitted conducting  raids, or \"rips,\" on  rival traffickers\nand   stealing their marijuana, thereby impeding the competition.\nHahn told Sheehan that  he had been wounded  by gunfire during  a\n\"rip\" in Tucson on December 8, 1989.   At trial, a police officer\ntestified to having found Hahn in the aftermath of the December 8\nshootout, and the government introduced photographs depicting the\nshootout scene, strewn with bullets and bales of marijuana. \n\n     2The cross-country transportation operation required manpow-\ner.  The  principal truck driver was Bradley, but on at least one\noccasion  coconspirators  Michael  Sheehan and  Jeff  Heino, Mark\nHeino's brother, were   brought to Arizona  by Hahn to help  with\nthe driving.   Hahn also recruited his stepson,  Craig Nezat, and\nNezat's cousin,  Robert Mercado,  to come to  New York  to assist\nwith  offloading.   And,  finally,  Hahn often  used  either Jeff\nHeino, Sheehan, or  Ken White, as a helper    to drive and assist\nin offloading the marijuana.   Although Mulligan took a back seat\nto  Mark Heino after the  latter was released  from prison, on at\nleast one occasion Hahn used Mulligan as a courier for transport-\ning the organization's currency from New York to Arizona.\n\n                                4\n\nsupervision,  approximating 5,000  pounds apiece.    The criminal\n\nconspiracy unravelled shortly thereafter,  however.  During 1992,\n\nHahn's performance faltered, due apparently to his cocaine habit,\n\nand he was cashiered by Lujan.  Heino was unable to reestablish a\n\nsupply line between Arizona and New Hampshire.  Finally, Hahn was\n\narrested in Arizona on November 12, 1992.3\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

The verdicts  are reviewed\n\nunder well-recognized standards:\n\n          We assess the sufficiency  of the evidence as\n          a whole, including all reasonable inferences,\n          in the  light most favorable to  the verdict,\n          with  a view to  whether a rational  trier of\n          fact could  have found  the defendant  guilty\n          beyond a reasonable  doubt.  We do  not weigh\n          witness credibility,  but resolve  all credi-\n          bility issues in  favor of the verdict.   The\n          evidence may be  entirely circumstantial, and\n          need not exclude  every reasonable hypothesis\n          of  innocence; that  is,  the factfinder  may\n\n                    \n\n     3Hahn's  ten codefendants entered  into plea agreements with\nthe government.\n\n                                5\n\n          decide  among  reasonable  interpretations of\n          the evidence.\n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 17 (citations omitted).\n               \n\n     2.   Continuing Criminal Enterprise\n                                        \n\n          A conviction  under 21 U.S.C.    848 for engaging  in a\n\ncontinuing criminal  enterprise (\"CCE\") requires  proof beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt that  the defendant (1) committed a  felony drug\n\noffense, (2) as  part of a continuing series  of such violations,\n\n(3) in concert with  five or more persons in relation  to whom he\n\nacted as a supervisor, organizer,  or manager, (4) and from which\n\nmultiple  operations  he  realized  substantial income  or  other\n\nresources.   See, e.g., United States v. Rouleau, 894 F.2d 13, 14\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir. 1990).   Hahn claims  that the  government established\n\nneither the third nor the fourth element of the CCE offense.\n\n          Under the  familiar construction accorded the third CCE\n\nelement, the jury  need only have found that  the predicate crime\n\nwas committed in concert with at least five different individuals\n\nin relation to whom the  defendant served as an organizer, super-\n\nvisor,  or in any  other management  position.   See 21  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n843(c)(2)(A); see also United States v.

First, Hahn concedes\n\nthat  he  supervised Craig  Nezat and  Robert Mercado.   Further,\n\nthere  is  uncontroverted evidence  that  he exercised  virtually\n\nexclusive managerial control of marijuana transportation  between\n\nArizona and  the Northeast, which means that  truck drivers Roger\n\nBradley, Michael Sheehan and Jeff Heino were under Hahn's control\n\nand  supervision from time to time  as well.  Although these five\n\nsubordinates were enough  to establish the third CCE element, Ken\n\nWhite and Hugh Mulligan were managed by Hahn as well.   See supra\n                                                                 \n\nat pp. 3-4.5\n\n                    \n\n     4As the Tenth Circuit explained in Jenkins: \n                                               \n\n          [The  CCE statute's]  use  of the  indefinite\n          article when describing 'a position of organ-\n                                  'a\n          izer' or 'a supervisory position or any other\n                   'a                         any other\n          position of  management' contemplates  that a\n          given network  may have  many persons  in au-\n          thority.  Thus, the defendant need not be the\n          dominant organizer  or manager of  the enter-\n          prise; he  need only  occupy some  managerial\n                                       some\n          position with respect  to five  or more  per-\n          sons. \n\nJenkins, 904 F.2d at 553 (emphasis in original).\n       \n\n     5It is therefore unnecessary to address Hahn's argument that\nhe did not control the New Hampshire branch  of the Lujan organi-\nzation.  \"[S]o  long as the  record supports a  finding that  any\n                                                                 \nfive people  were under  [the defendant's]  control, our task  is\ncomplete and the status of  the other individuals is immaterial.\"\nDavid, 940 F.2d at 731 (emphasis in original).\n     \n\n                                7\n\n          Hahn's  challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on\n\nthe fourth CCE  element is unavailing as well.   The \"substantial\n\nincome\" requirement may  be met either by direct  evidence of the\n\nrevenues  realized and resources accumulated by the defendant, or\n\nby  such circumstantial evidence  as the defendant's  position in\n\nthe criminal organization and the  volume of drugs handled by the\n\norganization.  United States v. Roman, 870 F.2d 65, 75 (2d Cir.),\n                                     \n\ncert. denied, 490  U.S. 1109 (1989); United States  v.

The government need only prove\n\nrevenue, not  profit.   See, e.g., Roman,  870 F.2d  at 75.   The\n                                        \n\nsheer  scope of  the  conspiracy,  which  generated  millions  of\n\ndollars from many  tons of marijuana over several years, provided\n\nample  basis for a  reasonable inference  that Hahn  realized far\n\nmore than trivial  amounts of income from the  organization.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid.    For example,  the trial  testimony indicated  that Bradley\n   \n\nalone transported approximately  50,000 pounds of marijuana  from\n\nArizona to  the Northeast  and over $1  million in cash  from New\n\n                                8\n\nYork  to  Arizona at  Hahn's  direction  on one  occasion  alone.\n\nCoconspirator  Ken  White  testified that  he  purchased  tens of\n\nthousands of dollars  worth of automobiles and handguns at Hahn's\n\nrequest.  And coconspirator Jeff Heino testified  that Hahn typi-\n\ncally spent $1,500 to $2,000 per day while Heino was working with\n\nhim  in the  field  on  organization business.

The\n\n                    \n\n     6Although Hahn's father testified that throughout the period\nin question his son lived in a trailer behind the family home and\nwas \"constantly  asking for money,\"  we may not presume  the jury\nincapable  of circumspection.   See Batista-Polanco, 927  F.2d at\n                                                   \n17.\n\n                                9\n\nevidence undergirding the CCE conviction  alone, see supra at pp.\n                                                          \n\n6-8, was sufficient to support a jury finding that Hahn conspired\n\nwith  at least  seven  other  persons  to  distribute  marijuana.\n\nBeyond  that, however, Hahn  concedes that  he was  a \"middleman\"\n\nbetween \"Dad\"  Lujan and Mark  Heino.  Finally, the  evidence was\n\nnot nearly so limited, but demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat  Hahn  was a  key  conspirator  in  a large-scale  marijuana\n\nconspiracy involving many other people.\n\n     4.   Firearms Conviction\n                             \n\n          Hahn contends  that the  government  did not  establish\n\nthat he  \"used or carried\" a firearm during  and in relation to a\n\ndrug  trafficking crime as required by 21  U.S.C.   924(c).  This\n\nclaim too is  without merit.  Hahn concedes  that \"many witnesses\n\ntestified  at trial  regarding the  fact that  the defendant  oc-\n\ncasionally carried  a weapon.\"7   Since we will  not second-guess\n\ncredibility determinations by the jury, id. at 17, that testimony\n                                           \n\nwas sufficient  evidence in  itself  since these  weapon-carrying\n\nincidents  involved  activities  in  direct  furtherance  of  the\n\nconspiracy.  See supra notes 1 &amp; 7.\n                      \n\n                    \n\n     7We mention  but a few examples.  First, coconspirator Craig\nNezat testified that  Hahn carried a gun  during their marijuana-\nrelated business trips  to New York.   Second, coconspirator  Ken\nWhite testified that he bought more than one dozen guns for Hahn,\nand that Hahn  almost always carried  a gun.  Finally,  when Hahn\nwas  found at the December  8, 1989 shoot-out  scene, he lay only\ninches from  a .45  Colt Commander, his  signature handgun.   See\n                                                                 \nsupra at note 1.\n     \n\n                                10\n\nB.   Motions for Mistrial\n                         \n\n          Hahn charges  error in the  denial of  his motions  for\n\nmistrial based on  the government's failure to establish that his\n\ninvolvement in the \"rip\" shootout in Tucson was in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.   A mistrial need not  be allowed absent a  clear\n\nshowing of prejudice.  United States v. Sclamo, 578 F.2d 888, 891\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1978); United  States v. Pappas, 611 F.2d 399, 406 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1979).  We review the mistrial ruling  for \"abuse of discre-\n\ntion.\"   United States v.  Dockray, 943 F.2d  152, 157 (1st  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991).\n\n          After the  government's opening statement,  the defense\n\nmoved for a  mistrial based on the prosecutor's  reference to the\n\nTucson \"rip.\"   See supra note 1.  The  government represented at\n                         \n\nsidebar  that it  would link  the  Tucson \"rip\"  with the  larger\n\nconspiracy through the testimony  of coconspirator Michael  Shee-\n\nhan.   The  court accordingly  denied  the motion  for  mistrial,\n\nwithout prejudice to  its renewal.  Sheehan  later testified that\n\nHahn had  admitted that he  conducted the Tucson \"rip\"  to \"knock\n\nout  the  competition.\"   Further,  Sheehan  testified  that Hahn\n\nconducted  at least  one other  such  raid while  Sheehan was  in\n\nArizona.\n\n          At the close of the government's case,  the court ruled\n\nthe Tucson \"rip\" evidence admissible  as an overt act in further-\n\nance  of  the conspiracy.   Hahn  presents no  argumentation even\n\nremotely suggestive of an abuse of discretion, merely reiterating\n\nthe unsupported  conclusion that the  Tucson \"rip\" was part  of a\n\n                                11\n\nseparate  conspiracy.  The government correctly responds that the\n\njury  reasonably could have found otherwise;  that is, by intimi-\n\ndating  the  competition,  and  stealing  their  marijuana,  Hahn\n\nfurthered the interests of the Lujan organization.\n\n                                12\n\nC.   Evidentiary Rulings\n                        \n\n          Hahn filed a pretrial motion in limine to  preclude, as\n                                                \n\nirrelevant or unduly  prejudicial:  (1)  testimony of an  Arizona\n\nstate  trooper who  had made  a routine  stop of a  vehicle being\n\ndriven by Hahn; and (2) testimony of another officer who searched\n\na  different vehicle  (subsequently linked  with  Hahn), and  the\n\nphysical evidence recovered in the ensuing inventory search.  \n\n     1.   Arizona Traffic Stop\n                              \n\n          Arizona State  Trooper Carlos Contreras  testified that\n\nhe encountered Hahn in  February of 1992 when he stopped  a black\n\nFord  pickup truck with  New Hampshire license  plates because it\n\nlacked mud flaps.   The driver, Hahn, was in lawful possession of\n\na .45  caliber Colt  Commander.  The  government argued  that the\n\ntraffic-stop evidence  was highly probative  of the scope  of the\n\nalleged conspiracy and Hahn's role in it, and that it corroborat-\n\ned important testimony provided by other prosecution witnesses.8\n\n          Hahn  argues that the traffic-stop and handgun evidence\n\nshould not have survived  the gauntlet for \"other acts\"  evidence\n\nestablished under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). \n\n          First, the past incident must have some rele-\n          vance  other  than  to  show the  defendant's\n          propensity to commit the crime. United States\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n     8First, it established that Hahn was driving a New Hampshire\nvehicle in Arizona.   Second, the black  Ford pickup registration\nwas in Hahn's name, and indicated a dwelling owned by coconspira-\ntor Mark Heino as Hahn's New Hampshire address.  Third, Ken White\nhad testified  to buying a  black Ford pickup at  Hahn's request.\nFourth, the  Colt  Commander  .45 bore  the  same  serial  number\nappearing on the  bill of sale for  a handgun Ken White  had pur-\nchased at Hahn's request.\n\n                                13\n\n          v.

Second, even  if specially  relevant,\n          the danger of  prejudice cannot substantially\n          outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\n          Id. at 138; Fed. R.

Furthermore, possession of a licensed\n                        \n\nfirearm is neither a bad act nor indicative of bad character.\n\n          Under the  required Rule  403 balancing,  see id.,  the\n                                                           \n\n\"other acts\" evidence itself posed scant  risk of engendering any\n                            \n\nimproper  inference of predisposition to possess or use a firearm\n\nunlawfully, as distinguished  from lawful access to  a particular\n                                         \n\nfirearm, a  piece of evidence highly relevant  to Hahn's involve-\n\nment  and role  in  the  alleged conspiracy  and  CCE.   Whatever\n\n\"prejudice\" resulted  by reason of  the fact that Hahn  was being\n\ntried, inter alia, on a weapons charge, was not only mitigated by\n                 \n\nthe  limiting instruction, see  Huddleston v.

We\n\ndiscern no unfair prejudice and no abuse of discretion.\n\n     2.   The Lincoln Mark VII\n                              \n\n          Hahn  attempted  to  preclude evidence  seized  from  a\n\nLincoln Mark  VII abandoned near  an airport in Islip,  New York.\n\nAn inventory search yielded, inter  alia, a .45 caliber Derringer\n                                        \n\nhandgun, several Colt  .45 caliber ammunition clips,  and various\n\ntravel documents  in Hahn's  name.   Coconspirator Ken  White had\n\ntestified  to purchasing an identical Lincoln  Mark VII at Hahn's\n\nbehest, and several witnesses testified that the Lincoln was used\n\nby  Hahn in his  New York City  area activities in  behalf of the\n\n                                15\n\nLujan organization.  The Derringer  bore a serial number matching\n\nthat on the  bill of sale White received when he purchased it, as\n\nhe did  other handguns,  at Hahn's request.   Finally,  among the\n\ntravel  documents found  in the  Lincoln  was the  receipt for  a\n\nround-trip  airline ticket  issued  in  Hahn's  name  for  travel\n\nbetween Tucson and Islip. \n\n          Hahn argues that this evidence should have been exclud-\n\ned under Rule  403 because its prejudicial  effect outweighed its\n\nprobative value.   The  difficulty with Hahn's  claim is  that he\n\n\"has  not shown  that  the  probative value  of  the 'other  act'\n\nevidence was substantially  outweighed by its unfair  prejudice.\"\n                                                    \n\nUnited  States v.

Thus,  no unfair  inference  of character-based\n\npredisposition was necessary to constitute the seized handgun and\n\nammunition  probative  evidence  on  several  important   factual\n\nissues, including Hahn's activities in the  New York area.  As no\n\ncautionary  instruction was  requested, we  discern  no abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                                16\n\n                                17\n\nD.   Impeachment Evidence\n                         \n\n          After trial,  Hahn's attorney  became aware  of a  plea\n\nagreement  and a  police report  relating  to government  witness\n\nRoger  Bradley  which  had  not  been  provided to  the  defense.\n\nClaiming that these documents would have been useful for impeach-\n\nment purposes, Hahn moved  for a new  trial.  The district  court\n\ndenied the motion.\n\n          \"[T]he district court's determination on the materiali-\n\nty of  newly discovered  evidence in  prosecutorial nondisclosure\n\ncases  is ordinarily  accorded  deference.\"    United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nSanchez,  917 F.2d 607, 618 (1st  Cir. 1990) (citations omitted),\n       \n\ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 977 (1991).  A new trial  is in order only\n            \n\nif Hahn can demonstrate a reasonable probability  that the result\n\nwould  have been  different had  the defense provided  the undis-\n\nclosed evidence before trial.   See Barrett v.

Hahn  was  a  career  criminal  who  had\n               \"devoted his entire life to the business\n               of trafficking in illegal drugs.\"\n\n          2.   Hahn used weapons, violence, and intimi-\n               dation as a day-to-day part of his busi-\n               ness operation.\n\n          3.   Estimated  conservatively, the  quantity\n               of  marijuana attributable  to Hahn  was\n               well in excess  of the 10,000  kilograms\n               necessary  to  qualify for  the  offense\n               level found  applicable in  the pre-sen-\n               tence report.\n\n          4.   Hahn managed and  corrupted considerably\n               more than five people over the course of\n               the conspiracy.\n\nThe only challenge to these findings is directed at the amount of\n\nmarijuana for which Hahn was held responsible.\n\n          The  \"drug quantity\" determination  must be based  on a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence, U.S.S.G.    1B1.3, and we  review\n\nonly  for clear  error.

The\n                                \n\npresentence report  recommended that  64,200 pounds  of marijuana\n\n(approximately  29,000 kilograms) be attributed to Hahn, based in\n\npart on  the trial testimony  of several witnesses  who recounted\n\nparticular  transactions during the  decade-long period from 1980\n\nto early 1991, augmented by an estimate of the amount transported\n\nby  Roger Bradley in  thirteen tractor-trailer loads  during 1991\n\nalone.  The  court conservatively estimated  the total amount  at\n\n49,700 pounds for sentencing purposes.\n\n                                20\n\n          Hahn's challenge  is based exclusively on a credibility\n\nattack against Bradley's trial testimony.  But see  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

See United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1212 (1st Cir.1993).  In 1992, Hahn and ten other defendants were jointly indicted in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, as former members of a nationwide marijuana trafficking conspiracy spanning more than a decade and headed by one Alberto \"Dad\" Lujan.  As a principal underboss, Hahn had been responsible for, inter alia, transporting smuggled Mexican marijuana from Arizona for distribution in California, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York, among other locales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980s, Hahn and Lujan were local marijuana dealers seeking to penetrate marijuana markets outside Arizona in order to capitalize on their connections with suppliers in Mexico.  Eventually, Hahn established a business relationship with Mark Heino, a New Hampshire native living in southern California.  Some of the marijuana Heino bought from Hahn, he resold in California.  The rest Heino distributed during his frequent trips to New Hampshire.  Heino himself became an underboss in the Lujan organization, a position he retained until his arrest on trafficking charges in early 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Heino out of circulation, the New Hampshire operation was taken over by Hugh Mulligan, another New Hampshire native.  Like Heino, Mulligan had been recruited into the Lujan organization by Hahn, who thereafter supervised Mulligan's New Hampshire operation.  Later, when the New Hampshire marijuana market softened, Mulligan introduced Hahn to Dennis and P.J. Dougherty, Long Island residents with New Hampshire ties.  The Doughertys afforded the Lujan organization access to the lucrative Metropolitan New York marijuana market, and large marijuana shipments were soon being trucked in from Arizona.  Several years later, after the Doughertys dropped out of the picture, Hahn established a high-volume marijuana trade with another New York dealer.  Meantime, Heino was released from prison in mid-1986, returned to New Hampshire, and reestablished himself in the Lujan organization.  During this period, Hahn concentrated on the organization's interests in Arizona, Metropolitan New York, and New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn's primary role was to supervise marijuana shipments from Arizona to New York and New England.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In early 1991, Lujan set up a bogus produce-trucking operation as a cover for the marijuana shipments.  A professional truck driver, one Roger Bradley, was recruited for the long-haul runs between Arizona and the Northeast.  Upon arrival at his East Coast destination, Bradley would contact Hahn to arrange for offloading.  Normally, Bradley would \"deadhead\" back to Arizona, but on occasion he transported large quantities of currency back to Lujan at Hahn's request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-country trucking operation was a success.  At its apex, during 1991 alone, thirteen to fifteen tractor-trailer loads were transported from Arizona to the Northeast under Hahn's supervision, approximating 5,000 pounds apiece.  The criminal conspiracy unravelled shortly thereafter, however.  During 1992, Hahn's performance faltered, due apparently to his cocaine habit, and he was cashiered by Lujan.  Heino was unable to reestablish a supply line between Arizona and New Hampshire.  Finally, Hahn was arrested in Arizona on November 12, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991), quoted in United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1011 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Welch, 15 F.3d at 1212.

We do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Continuing Criminal Enterprise</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conviction under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 848 for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (\"CCE\") requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) committed a felony drug offense, (2) as part of a continuing series of such violations, (3) in concert with five or more persons in relation to whom he acted as a supervisor, organizer, or manager, (4) and from which multiple operations he realized substantial income or other resources.  See, e.g., United States v. Rouleau, 894 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir.1990).  Hahn claims that the government established neither the third nor the fourth element of the CCE offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the familiar construction accorded the third CCE element, the jury need only have found that the predicate crime was committed in concert with at least five different individuals in relation to whom the defendant served as an organizer, supervisor, or in any other management position.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(c)(2)(A);  see also United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 730-32 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied sub nom., Toro Aristizabal v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 605, 116 L.Ed.2d 628 (1991), and cert. denied sub nom., Yarden v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 908, 116 L.Ed.2d 809 (1992), and cert. denied sub nom., Toro Aristizabal v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1298, 117 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992), and cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2301, 119 L.Ed.2d 224 (1992);  United States v. Jenkins, 904 F.2d 549, 553 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 962, 111 S.Ct. 395, 112 L.Ed.2d 404 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record abounds with evidence that Hahn performed a supervisory role in the Lujan organization which required management of more than five other individuals.  First, Hahn concedes that he supervised Craig Nezat and Robert Mercado.  Further, there is uncontroverted evidence that he exercised virtually exclusive managerial control of marijuana transportation between Arizona and the Northeast, which means that truck drivers Roger Bradley, Michael Sheehan and Jeff Heino were under Hahn's control and supervision from time to time as well.  Although these five subordinates were enough to establish the third CCE element, Ken White and Hugh Mulligan were managed by Hahn as well.  See supra at p. 505.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the fourth CCE element is unavailing as well.  The \"substantial income\" requirement may be met either by direct evidence of the revenues realized and resources accumulated by the defendant, or by such circumstantial evidence as the defendant's position in the criminal organization and the volume of drugs handled by the organization.  United States v. Roman, 870 F.2d 65, 75 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1109, 109 S.Ct. 3164, 104 L.Ed.2d 1026 (1989);  United States v. Sisca, 503 F.2d 1337, 1346 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1008, 95 S.Ct. 328, 42 L.Ed.2d 283 (1974).  The \"substantial income\" test establishes no fixed minimum, but is intended \"to exclude trivial amounts derived from occasional drug sales,\" Roman, 870 F.2d at 75;  see also United States v. Medina, 940 F.2d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir.1991) (\"The practical meaning of 'substantial income or resources' will normally be a question for the trier of fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that Hahn derived \"substantial income\" from the management services rendered to the Lujan organization.  The government need only prove revenue, not profit.  See, e.g., Roman, 870 F.2d at 75.   The sheer scope of the conspiracy, which generated millions of dollars from many tons of marijuana over several years, provided ample basis for a reasonable inference that Hahn realized far more than trivial amounts of income from the organization.  See id.   For example, the trial testimony indicated that Bradley alone transported approximately 50,000 pounds of marijuana from Arizona to the Northeast and over $1 million in cash from New York to Arizona at Hahn's direction on one occasion alone.  Coconspirator Ken White testified that he purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of automobiles and handguns at Hahn's request.  And coconspirator Jeff Heino testified that Hahn typically spent $1,500 to $2,000 per day while Heino was working with him in the field on organization business.  The fourth CCE element was established beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Conspiracy to Possess and Distribute Marijuana</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for conspiring to distribute marijuana, see 21 U.S.C. 846, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that \"(1) a conspiracy existed, (2) ... the defendant knew of it, and (3) ... he voluntarily participated in it.\"  David, 940 F.2d at 735.  \"A criminal conspiracy is a tacit or explicit agreement to perform an unlawful act or omit one the law requires.\"  United States v. Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d 833, 840 (1st Cir.1990), citing Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 777, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1289-90, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975).  The illicit agreement may be established by direct and circumstantial evidence.  Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn's claim that the government failed to establish an agreement among him and his confederates is frivolous.  The evidence undergirding the CCE conviction alone, see supra at pp. 506-07, was sufficient to support a jury finding that Hahn conspired with at least seven other persons to distribute marijuana.  Beyond that, however, Hahn concedes that he was a \"middleman\" between \"Dad\" Lujan and Mark Heino.  Finally, the evidence was not nearly so limited, but demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Hahn was a key conspirator in a large-scale marijuana conspiracy involving many other people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Firearms Conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn contends that the government did not establish that he \"used or carried\" a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime as required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  This claim too is without merit.  Hahn concedes that \"many witnesses testified at trial regarding the fact that the defendant occasionally carried a weapon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Since we will not second-guess credibility determinations by the jury, id. at 17, that testimony was sufficient evidence in itself since these weapon-carrying incidents involved activities in direct furtherance of the conspiracy.  See supra notes 1 &amp; 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Motions for Mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn charges error in the denial of his motions for mistrial based on the government's failure to establish that his involvement in the \"rip\" shootout in Tucson was in furtherance of the conspiracy.  A mistrial need not be allowed absent a clear showing of prejudice.  United States v. Sclamo, 578 F.2d 888, 891 (1st Cir.1978);  United States v. Pappas, 611 F.2d 399, 406 (1st Cir.1979).  We review the mistrial ruling for \"abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 157 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government's opening statement, the defense moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's reference to the Tucson \"rip.\"   See supra note 1.  The government represented at sidebar that it would link the Tucson \"rip\" with the larger conspiracy through the testimony of coconspirator Michael Sheehan.  The court accordingly denied the motion for mistrial, without prejudice to its renewal.  Sheehan later testified that Hahn had admitted that he conducted the Tucson \"rip\" to \"knock out the competition.\"   Further, Sheehan testified that Hahn conducted at least one other such raid while Sheehan was in Arizona.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, the court ruled the Tucson \"rip\" evidence admissible as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Hahn presents no argumentation even remotely suggestive of an abuse of discretion, merely reiterating the unsupported conclusion that the Tucson \"rip\" was part of a separate conspiracy.  The government correctly responds that the jury reasonably could have found otherwise;  that is, by intimidating the competition, and stealing their marijuana, Hahn furthered the interests of the Lujan organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn filed a pretrial motion in limine to preclude, as irrelevant or unduly prejudicial:  (1) testimony of an Arizona state trooper who had made a routine stop of a vehicle being driven by Hahn;  and (2) testimony of another officer who searched a different vehicle (subsequently linked with Hahn), and the physical evidence recovered in the ensuing inventory search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Arizona Traffic Stop</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arizona State Trooper Carlos Contreras testified that he encountered Hahn in February of 1992 when he stopped a black Ford pickup truck with New Hampshire license plates because it lacked mud flaps.  The driver, Hahn, was in lawful possession of a .45 caliber Colt Commander.  The government argued that the traffic-stop evidence was highly probative of the scope of the alleged conspiracy and Hahn's role in it, and that it corroborated important testimony provided by other prosecution witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn argues that the traffic-stop and handgun evidence should not have survived the gauntlet for \"other acts\" evidence established under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>First, the past incident must have some relevance other than to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.

Then, with defense counsel's imprimatur, a firm jury instruction was given to the effect, inter alia, that it was lawful for Hahn to possess the handgun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court correctly ruled that the challenged \"other acts\" evidence was not precluded under Rule 404(b)'s absolute bar, which \"excludes evidence ... relevant only because it shows bad character,\" United States v. Ferrer-Cruz, 899 F.2d 135, 137 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis in original);  see Williams, 985 F.2d at 637;  all evidence derived from the traffic stop, including the handgun, clearly bore direct relevance to legitimate issues, see note 7 supra.

Whatever \"prejudice\" resulted by reason of the fact that Hahn was being tried, inter alia, on a weapons charge, was not only mitigated by the limiting instruction, see Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 691-92, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1502, 99 L.Ed.2d 771, citing United States v.

We discern no unfair prejudice and no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Lincoln Mark VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn attempted to preclude evidence seized from a Lincoln Mark VII abandoned near an airport in Islip, New York.  An inventory search yielded, inter alia, a .45 caliber Derringer handgun, several Colt .45 caliber ammunition clips, and various travel documents in Hahn's name.  Coconspirator Ken White had testified to purchasing an identical Lincoln Mark VII at Hahn's behest, and several witnesses testified that the Lincoln was used by Hahn in his New York City area activities in behalf of the Lujan organization.  The Derringer bore a serial number matching that on the bill of sale White received when he purchased it, as he did other handguns, at Hahn's request.  Finally, among the travel documents found in the Lincoln was the receipt for a round-trip airline ticket issued in Hahn's name for travel between Tucson and Islip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn argues that this evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.  The difficulty with Hahn's claim is that he \"has not shown that the probative value of the 'other act' evidence was substantially outweighed by its unfair prejudice.\"  United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1011 (1st Cir.1993) (emphasis in original);  see United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989) (\"all evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided\").  Although evidence of handgun possession may indeed invite an inference that the defendant used the gun, the entirely legitimate predicate inference for so concluding is that prior possession makes it \"more probable\" that the defendant used a handgun than would be the case if there were no such evidence.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Thus, no unfair inference of character-based predisposition was necessary to constitute the seized handgun and ammunition probative evidence on several important factual issues, including Hahn's activities in the New York area.  As no cautionary instruction was requested, we discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Impeachment Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, Hahn's attorney became aware of a plea agreement and a police report relating to government witness Roger Bradley which had not been provided to the defense.  Claiming that these documents would have been useful for impeachment purposes, Hahn moved for a new trial.  The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he district court's determination on the materiality of newly discovered evidence in prosecutorial nondisclosure cases is ordinarily accorded deference.\"  United States v.

A new trial is in order only if Hahn can demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had the defense been provided the undisclosed evidence before trial.  See Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1189 (1st Cir.1992);  Sanchez, 917 F.2d at 617.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that no such showing had been made by Hahn because:  (1) defense counsel had been provided with a plea agreement between Bradley and the United States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire, and had been made aware of the existence of the Arizona plea agreement even though the document itself was not provided;  (2) Hahn's counsel made good use of these plea agreements at trial and, indeed, Bradley admitted on cross-examination that he was hoping for a lighter sentence in exchange for his testimony;  and (3) the Arizona police report was cumulative, as it contained information previously provided to the defense in other documents, and had been effectively used in cross-examination.  Careful review leaves no doubt that these findings were well founded, in law and fact.  \" 'Impeachment evidence, even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive cross-examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist when that evidence is cumulative or collateral.' \"  Id. at 618-19 (quoting United States v.

Sec. 1B1.3, and we review only for clear error.  United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1287 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2393, 124 L.Ed.2d 294 (1993).  The presentence report recommended that 64,200 pounds of marijuana (approximately 29,000 kilograms) be attributed to Hahn, based in part on the trial testimony of several witnesses who recounted particular transactions during the decade-long period from 1980 to early 1991, augmented by an estimate of the amount transported by Roger Bradley in thirteen tractor-trailer loads during 1991 alone.  The court conservatively estimated the total amount at 49,700 pounds for sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn's challenge is based exclusively on a credibility attack against Bradley's trial testimony.  But see United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1198 (1st Cir.1993) (where testimony provides competent basis for estimating drug quantity, we need go no further, id. at 1200).   Not only are the district court findings fully supported, but Hahn does not allege that he was responsible for less than the 10,000 kilograms of marijuana required to trigger BOL 36.  See note 10 supra.   Thus, any alleged discrepancy in weight would be immaterial for guideline sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hahn's secondary role was to ensure the security of the organization's marijuana supply in Arizona.  Several witnesses testified that Hahn almost always carried a .45 caliber Colt Commander handgun.  Coconspirator Michael Sheehan testified that Hahn admitted conducting raids, or \"rips,\" on rival traffickers and stealing their marijuana, thereby impeding the competition.  Hahn told Sheehan that he had been wounded by gunfire during a \"rip\" in Tucson on December 8, 1989.  At trial, a police officer testified to having found Hahn in the aftermath of the December 8 shootout, and the government introduced photographs depicting the shootout scene, strewn with bullets and bales of marijuana</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The cross-country transportation operation required manpower.

Hahn also recruited his stepson, Craig Nezat, and Nezat's cousin, Robert Mercado, to come to New York to assist with offloading.  And, finally, Hahn often used either Jeff Heino, Sheehan, or Ken White, as a helper--to drive and assist in offloading the marijuana.  Although Mulligan took a back seat to Mark Heino after the latter was released from prison, on at least one occasion Hahn used Mulligan as a courier for transporting the organization's currency from New York to Arizona</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hahn's ten codefendants entered into plea agreements with the government</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As the Tenth Circuit explained in Jenkins:</p>\n        <p>[The CCE statute's] use of the indefinite article when describing 'a position of organizer' or 'a supervisory position or any other position of management' contemplates that a given network may have many persons in authority.

In 1992, Hahn and ten other defendants were jointly indicted in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, as former members of a nationwide marijuana trafficking conspiracy spanning more than a decade and headed by one Alberto \"Dad\" Lujan.  As a principal underboss, Hahn had been responsible for, inter alia, transporting smuggled Mexican marijuana from Arizona for distribution in California, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York, among other locales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980s, Hahn and Lujan were local marijuana dealers seeking to penetrate marijuana markets outside Arizona in order to capitalize on their connections with suppliers in Mexico.  Eventually, Hahn established a business relationship with Mark Heino, a New Hampshire native living in southern California.  Some of the marijuana Heino bought from Hahn, he resold in California.  The rest Heino distributed during his frequent trips to New Hampshire.  Heino himself became an underboss in the Lujan organization, a position he retained until his arrest on trafficking charges in early 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Heino out of circulation, the New Hampshire operation was taken over by Hugh Mulligan, another New Hampshire native.  Like Heino, Mulligan had been recruited into the Lujan organization by Hahn, who thereafter supervised Mulligan's New Hampshire operation.  Later, when the New Hampshire marijuana market softened, Mulligan introduced Hahn to Dennis and P.J. Dougherty, Long Island residents with New Hampshire ties.  The Doughertys afforded the Lujan organization access to the lucrative Metropolitan New York marijuana market, and large marijuana shipments were soon being trucked in from Arizona.  Several years later, after the Doughertys dropped out of the picture, Hahn established a high-volume marijuana trade with another New York dealer.  Meantime, Heino was released from prison in mid-1986, returned to New Hampshire, and reestablished himself in the Lujan organization.  During this period, Hahn concentrated on the organization's interests in Arizona, Metropolitan New York, and New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn's primary role was to supervise marijuana shipments from Arizona to New York and New England.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In early 1991, Lujan set up a bogus produce-trucking operation as a cover for the marijuana shipments.  A professional truck driver, one Roger Bradley, was recruited for the long-haul runs between Arizona and the Northeast.  Upon arrival at his East Coast destination, Bradley would contact Hahn to arrange for offloading.  Normally, Bradley would \"deadhead\" back to Arizona, but on occasion he transported large quantities of currency back to Lujan at Hahn's request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-country trucking operation was a success.  At its apex, during 1991 alone, thirteen to fifteen tractor-trailer loads were transported from Arizona to the Northeast under Hahn's supervision, approximating 5,000 pounds apiece.  The criminal conspiracy unravelled shortly thereafter, however.  During 1992, Hahn's performance faltered, due apparently to his cocaine habit, and he was cashiered by Lujan.  Heino was unable to reestablish a supply line between Arizona and New Hampshire.  Finally, Hahn was arrested in Arizona on November 12, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

First, Hahn concedes that he supervised Craig Nezat and Robert Mercado.  Further, there is uncontroverted evidence that he exercised virtually exclusive managerial control of marijuana transportation between Arizona and the Northeast, which means that truck drivers Roger Bradley, Michael Sheehan and Jeff Heino were under Hahn's control and supervision from time to time as well.  Although these five subordinates were enough to establish the third CCE element, Ken White and Hugh Mulligan were managed by Hahn as well.

The government need only prove revenue, not profit.  See, e.g., Roman, 870 F.2d at 75.   The sheer scope of the conspiracy, which generated millions of dollars from many tons of marijuana over several years, provided ample basis for a reasonable inference that Hahn realized far more than trivial amounts of income from the organization.  See id.   For example, the trial testimony indicated that Bradley alone transported approximately 50,000 pounds of marijuana from Arizona to the Northeast and over $1 million in cash from New York to Arizona at Hahn's direction on one occasion alone.  Coconspirator Ken White testified that he purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of automobiles and handguns at Hahn's request.  And coconspirator Jeff Heino testified that Hahn typically spent $1,500 to $2,000 per day while Heino was working with him in the field on organization business.

The evidence undergirding the CCE conviction alone, see supra at pp. 506-07, was sufficient to support a jury finding that Hahn conspired with at least seven other persons to distribute marijuana.  Beyond that, however, Hahn concedes that he was a \"middleman\" between \"Dad\" Lujan and Mark Heino.  Finally, the evidence was not nearly so limited, but demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Hahn was a key conspirator in a large-scale marijuana conspiracy involving many other people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Firearms Conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn contends that the government did not establish that he \"used or carried\" a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime as required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  This claim too is without merit.  Hahn concedes that \"many witnesses testified at trial regarding the fact that the defendant occasionally carried a weapon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Since we will not second-guess credibility determinations by the jury, id. at 17, that testimony was sufficient evidence in itself since these weapon-carrying incidents involved activities in direct furtherance of the conspiracy.

The government represented at sidebar that it would link the Tucson \"rip\" with the larger conspiracy through the testimony of coconspirator Michael Sheehan.  The court accordingly denied the motion for mistrial, without prejudice to its renewal.  Sheehan later testified that Hahn had admitted that he conducted the Tucson \"rip\" to \"knock out the competition.\"   Further, Sheehan testified that Hahn conducted at least one other such raid while Sheehan was in Arizona.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the government's case, the court ruled the Tucson \"rip\" evidence admissible as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Hahn presents no argumentation even remotely suggestive of an abuse of discretion, merely reiterating the unsupported conclusion that the Tucson \"rip\" was part of a separate conspiracy.  The government correctly responds that the jury reasonably could have found otherwise;  that is, by intimidating the competition, and stealing their marijuana, Hahn furthered the interests of the Lujan organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

The driver, Hahn, was in lawful possession of a .45 caliber Colt Commander.  The government argued that the traffic-stop evidence was highly probative of the scope of the alleged conspiracy and Hahn's role in it, and that it corroborated important testimony provided by other prosecution witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn argues that the traffic-stop and handgun evidence should not have survived the gauntlet for \"other acts\" evidence established under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>First, the past incident must have some relevance other than to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.

An inventory search yielded, inter alia, a .45 caliber Derringer handgun, several Colt .45 caliber ammunition clips, and various travel documents in Hahn's name.  Coconspirator Ken White had testified to purchasing an identical Lincoln Mark VII at Hahn's behest, and several witnesses testified that the Lincoln was used by Hahn in his New York City area activities in behalf of the Lujan organization.  The Derringer bore a serial number matching that on the bill of sale White received when he purchased it, as he did other handguns, at Hahn's request.  Finally, among the travel documents found in the Lincoln was the receipt for a round-trip airline ticket issued in Hahn's name for travel between Tucson and Islip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hahn argues that this evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.

Although evidence of handgun possession may indeed invite an inference that the defendant used the gun, the entirely legitimate predicate inference for so concluding is that prior possession makes it \"more probable\" that the defendant used a handgun than would be the case if there were no such evidence.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Thus, no unfair inference of character-based predisposition was necessary to constitute the seized handgun and ammunition probative evidence on several important factual issues, including Hahn's activities in the New York area.  As no cautionary instruction was requested, we discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.

Careful review leaves no doubt that these findings were well founded, in law and fact.  \" 'Impeachment evidence, even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive cross-examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist when that evidence is cumulative or collateral.' \"  Id. at 618-19 (quoting United States v.

The presentence report recommended that 64,200 pounds of marijuana (approximately 29,000 kilograms) be attributed to Hahn, based in part on the trial testimony of several witnesses who recounted particular transactions during the decade-long period from 1980 to early 1991, augmented by an estimate of the amount transported by Roger Bradley in thirteen tractor-trailer loads during 1991 alone.

Not only are the district court findings fully supported, but Hahn does not allege that he was responsible for less than the 10,000 kilograms of marijuana required to trigger BOL 36.  See note 10 supra.   Thus, any alleged discrepancy in weight would be immaterial for guideline sentencing purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hahn's secondary role was to ensure the security of the organization's marijuana supply in Arizona.  Several witnesses testified that Hahn almost always carried a .45 caliber Colt Commander handgun.  Coconspirator Michael Sheehan testified that Hahn admitted conducting raids, or \"rips,\" on rival traffickers and stealing their marijuana, thereby impeding the competition.  Hahn told Sheehan that he had been wounded by gunfire during a \"rip\" in Tucson on December 8, 1989.  At trial, a police officer testified to having found Hahn in the aftermath of the December 8 shootout, and the government introduced photographs depicting the shootout scene, strewn with bullets and bales of marijuana</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The cross-country transportation operation required manpower.  The principal truck driver was Bradley, but on at least one occasion coconspirators Michael Sheehan and Jeff Heino, Mark Heino's brother, were brought to Arizona by Hahn to help with the driving.  Hahn also recruited his stepson, Craig Nezat, and Nezat's cousin, Robert Mercado, to come to New York to assist with offloading.  And, finally, Hahn often used either Jeff Heino, Sheehan, or Ken White, as a helper--to drive and assist in offloading the marijuana.  Although Mulligan took a back seat to Mark Heino after the latter was released from prison, on at least one occasion Hahn used Mulligan as a courier for transporting the organization's currency from New York to Arizona</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hahn's ten codefendants entered into plea agreements with the government</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As the Tenth Circuit explained in Jenkins:</p>\n        <p>[The CCE statute's] use of the indefinite article when describing 'a position of organizer' or 'a supervisory position or any other position of management' contemplates that a given network may have many persons in authority.

Sec. 2D1.5, comment.  (n. 4).  See id. Sec. 3D1.3</p>\n        <p>On the conspiracy conviction, the court conservatively calculated the drug quantity at 10,000 to 30,000 kilograms of marijuana, see id.
