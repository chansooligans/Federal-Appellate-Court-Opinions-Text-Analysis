The  Miller  Act,  40  U.S.C.\n                           \n\n   270a-f  requires all  contractors  bidding for  government\n\nconstruction   contracts  in  excess   of  $25,000   to  post\n\nperformance  and payment  bonds, and  the  Air Force  further\n\nrequires  that a  bid bond  accompany  the bid  itself.1   In\n\norder to qualify for  consideration, contractors must  submit\n\nbonds  issued  by  companies approved  by  the  United States\n\nTreasury  and listed  in  Treasury  Department Circular  570,\n\ncommonly called the \"T-list.\"  See  48 C.F.R.   28.202(a)(1).\n                                  \n\nThe  bonds  must  also be  submitted  on  standard government\n\nforms:   SF 24 (bid  bond), SF 25  (payment bond) and  SF 25A\n\n(performance bond).\n\n     Defendant  Lawrence  Gordon  was   the  head  of   Tower\n\nAssociates, Inc.,  a Winchester,  Massachusetts, construction\n\ncompany   seeking  to  secure   a  contract  to   renovate  a\n\nphotography  laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford,\n\nMassachusetts.  In September 1988 Tower submitted the low bid\n\nfor  the project,  offering to  perform  the renovations  for\n\n$1,000,200.  This bid was accompanied by a bid bond issued by\n\nContinental Surety Company, a surety or purported surety that\n\ndid  not appear  on the  T-list and  which apparently  had no\n\n                    \n\n     1\"Bid  bonds\"  ensure  that a  contractor  will  in fact\nundertake the contract if its bid is accepted;   \"performance\nbonds\"  guarantee  that  the  contractor  will  complete  the\nproject  in accordance with the specifications;  and \"payment\nbonds\" ensure that those who  furnish labor and materials for\nthe project will be paid.\n\n                             -2-\n\nassets.   The Air  Force employee responsible  for overseeing\n\nthe  bidding process, Lorraine  McLoughlin, did not  at first\n\nnotice  this problem  and Tower was  awarded the  contract on\n\nSeptember 30, 1988.\n\n     When   shortly   thereafter  McLoughlin   learned   that\n\nContinental was not an approved issuer, she called Gordon and\n\ninformed him that Tower's payment and performance bonds would\n\nhave to  be written by  a T-listed  company.  On  October 17,\n\n1988,  Gordon  presented  a  payment   and  performance  bond\n\npurportedly  issued by Amwest Surety Insurance Co., a company\n\nthat did appear on  the T-list.  The bond bore  Tower's seal,\n\nas well as the signatures of Gordon and one \"Alan Stime,\" who\n\nwas  listed as  Amwest's  attorney-in-fact.    The  bond  was\n\naccompanied  by a power of attorney, purportedly from Amwest,\n\nalso signed by \"Alan Stime.\"\n\n     The  Amwest bond and power of attorney were counterfeits\n\nfabricated by  James  Grier, the  principal  of  Continental.\n\nGrier later testified  at trial  that he  produced the  bogus\n\ndocuments  at Gordon's  request.   Sandra  Catalano, a  Tower\n\nemployee, testified  at trial that  she was present  when the\n\nbond was  signed by  Gordon  and defendant  Aaron Stern,  who\n\nsigned  the  bond as  \"Alan  Stime.\"    At trial,  an  Amwest\n\nofficial testified  that the bond  was not  a genuine  Amwest\n\nbond  and  that  no \"Alan  Stime\"  was  or ever  had  been an\n\nauthorized attorney in fact for Amwest.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The Air Force  rejected the phony bond  after McLoughlin\n\nnoted that some of  the signatures on the bond appeared to be\n\nfacsimiles  and that  the purported  Amwest  seal was  poorly\n\nimpressed and  illegible.   On October  19, 1988,  McLoughlin\n\nrequested that Tower resubmit its bonds and enclosed standard\n\ngovernment bond forms.   The Air Force received  a second set\n\nof bonds, on the government  forms, from Tower on October 24,\n\n1988.   These bonds were  also purportedly issued  by Amwest,\n\nbut the typed  name of the  attorney-in-fact under the  \"Alan\n\nStime\" signature was \"Aaron Stern.\"  By this time, McLoughlin\n\nhad been  told by an  Amwest employee that Amwest  \"had never\n\nheard of Tower Associates.\"\n\n     Rather than  accept the bonds, McLoughlin forwarded them\n\nto the  Air Force Office  of Investigations and sent  Tower a\n\nnotice to cure.   On November  18, 1988, McLoughlin  notified\n\nGordon of her  communications with Amwest.   After requesting\n\nan  extension  of  time  to  submit  new  bonds,  Tower  sent\n\nMcLoughlin  a  third  set  of  bonds on  December  13,  1988,\n\nexplaining that Tower  \"[had been] given a bond  which proved\n\ninvalid.\"   This third  set of bonds,  like the  original bid\n\nbond, was issued by Continental  and signed by Aaron Stern as\n\nattorney-in-fact.   As Continental  was still  not on  the T-\n\nlist, McLoughlin rejected the bonds.\n\n     The Air Force terminated Tower's award on March 3, 1989,\n\nand eventually  awarded the contract  (without rebidding)  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nFellsway,  Inc., which had  submitted the second  lowest bid.\n\nOn  June 13, 1991, Gordon and Stern  were charged in a multi-\n\ncount indictment with the following offenses:\n\n     Count 1   Gordon  and  Stern   were  both  charged  with\n               conspiring to defraud the United States in the\n               solicitation  and  award of  the  construction\n               contract at Hanscom Air Force  Base. 18 U.S.C.\n                 371 (conspiracy to defraud).\n\n     Count 2   Both    defendants    were     charged    with\n               counterfeiting the  October 17,  1988, payment\n               and  performance  bond purportedly  issued  by\n               Amwest Surety  Insurance Company. 18  U.S.C.  \n               494    (making,    uttering    or   presenting\n               counterfeit bond).\n\n     Count 3   Gordon was  charged with  knowingly presenting\n               the same counterfeit bond to the Air Force. 18\n               U.S.C.   494.\n\n     Count 4   Gordon  and  Stern  were  both  charged   with\n               uttering to  the Air Force a counterfeit power\n               of attorney. 18 U.S.C.   495 (making, uttering\n               or presenting counterfeit power of attorney).\n\n     Count 5   Both  defendants   were  charged   with  false\n               statements   in   completing   and  submitting\n               Standard  Form  25,  the government  form  for\n               performance bonds.   18  U.S.C.   1001  (false\n               statement statute).\n\n     Count 6   Both  defendants   were  charged   with  false\n               statements   in   completing   and  submitting\n               Standard  Form 25A,  the  government form  for\n               payment bonds.  18 U.S.C.   1001.\n\n     After a jury trial, Stern  was convicted on counts 1 and\n\n4, and acquitted on count 2. Gordon was convicted on count 3,\n\nand acquitted  on counts 1,  2 and 4.   Both  defendants were\n\nconvicted on Counts 5 and 6.  Gordon moved for a new trial on\n\nJune  19, 1992,  arguing  that  the  verdict  was  internally\n\ninconsistent and  that the  government had  withheld material\n\n                             -5-\n\nexculpatory  evidence.  The district court denied this motion\n\non December 18, 1992.\n\n     On  October 13, 1992, the district court sentenced Stern\n\nto  a 60-day  term of  imprisonment, along  with a  period of\n\nsupervised release.   Gordon  was sentenced  on November  24,\n\n1992, to  a 30-day  term of imprisonment  and nine  months of\n\nhome confinement.  Both defendants were also held jointly and\n\nseverally  liable  for  restitution.2    These   consolidated\n\nappeals followed.  Stern's counsel has briefed and argued the\n\ncase; Gordon, with  this court's permission, has  relied upon\n\nhis district court filings in support of a new trial.\n\n     In  this court  both  defendants  claim  that  the  jury\n\nverdicts are internally  inconsistent.  Gordon argued  in the\n\ndistrict court that since he was acquitted (under count 2) of\n\ncounterfeiting the October  17 bond, it was  inconsistent for\n\nthe jury then to convict him  (under count 3) of uttering the\n\nsame counterfeit bond.  Stern  points to his own acquittal of\n\nthe charge of counterfeiting  the bond (again under  count 2)\n\nand  protests that this acquittal undermines the jury verdict\n\nconvicting Stern (under  count 4) of uttering  a forged power\n\nof attorney in support of the same bond.\n\n                    \n\n     2Stern's  sentence  was  stayed  pending  appeal.    The\ndistrict  court denied Gordon's motion  for a similar stay on\nJanuary  19,  1993, but  this  court  stayed the  payment  of\nGordon's restitution pending appeal on August 24, 1993.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     Both objections lack  merit.  As the  defendants purport\n\nto recognize, general  jury verdicts may not  normally be set\n\naside for inconsistency as between counts.  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nPowell,  469  U.S.   57,  64-65  (1984);  United   States  v.\n                                                         \n\nBucuvalas, 909  F.2d 593, 597  (1st Cir. 1990).   The reasons\n         \n\nare explained by  Judge Friendly in United States v. Maybury,\n                                                            \n\n274  F.2d 899  (2d Cir.  1960),  and do  not need  repeating.\n\nMaybury is relied on  by both defendants because the  appeals\n       \n\ncourt there did set aside  verdicts as inconsistent.  But the\n\ninconsistent verdicts  were there  rendered by a  judge in  a\n                                                       \n\njury-waived trial.   The whole point of Maybury  is that (for\n                                               \n\nboth practical and historical reasons) the general verdict by\n\na jury  is a  special case but  a requirement  of consistency\n\ndoes apply to written findings  made by a single judge.   Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 903.\n\n     We  need not  discuss  other inconsistent-verdict  cases\n\ncited  by defendants  because,  as it  happens,  there is  no\n\nnecessary inconsistency in the verdicts  in this case.  As to\n\nGordon,  there  was  evidence  from  Grier  that  he  (Grier)\n\nfabricated the October 17, 1988, bond, but also evidence that\n\nGordon  knew it was counterfeit and nevertheless presented it\n\nto the Air Force.  The jury may have supposed (quite wrongly)\n\nthat Grier's admission entirely lifted responsibility for the\n\ncounterfeiting from Gordon's  shoulders but also  permissibly\n\n                             -7-\n\nbelieved  that  Gordon uttered  the  bond  knowing  it to  be\n\nforged.3\n\n     Similarly,  the  acquittal  of Stern  on  the  charge of\n\ncounterfeiting the same bond, again quite possibly because of\n\nGrier's admission,  is in  no way  inconsistent with  Stern's\n\nconviction for uttering  to the Air Force the companion power\n\nof attorney document knowing it to be forged.  In addition to\n\nother  evidence to support the uttering conviction, there was\n\ndirect  testimony  from Sandra  Catalano  that  Stern himself\n\nsigned the bond using the phony signature \"Alan Stime.\"  \n\n     Whether or  not Stern,  Gordon or  both could  have been\n\nconvicted of procuring or participating in the counterfeiting\n\nof the bond itself is irrelevant.  It is sufficient to dispel\n\nthe taint of inconsistency that a rational jury  could easily\n\nhave acquitted on count 2  while convicting Gordon on count 3\n\nand  Stern on  count 4.   And,  as explained  at the  outset,\n\ninconsistency  would   not   in  any   event  undermine   the\n\nconvictions  so  long as  they themselves  were, as  they are\n\nhere, supported by sufficient evidence.  See Powell, 469 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 67.\n\n                    \n\n     3Gordon's  claim that  the  conspiracy acquittal  (under\ncount  1) is inconsistent with the uttering conviction (under\ncount 3)  is even more  far-fetched.  True, the  uttering was\ncharged as an  act in furtherance  of the conspiracy.   But a\nliteral  minded jury might  believe that the  uttering itself\nwas   proved  amply  but  that  the  \"agreement\"  element  of\nconspiracy had not been established.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     Next,  Gordon claimed  in the  district  court that  the\n\ngovernment violated its obligation, under  Brady v. Maryland,\n                                                            \n\n373  U.S. 83  (1963),  to  produce  exculpatory  evidence  by\n\nfailing to turn over the  grand jury testimony of Grier, whom\n\nStern called as  a witness.  The background is  this:  Grier,\n\ncalled by Stern as a defense witness, was then cross-examined\n\nby Gordon's counsel--not by the  government.  On this  cross-\n\nexamination, Grier proceeded to testify that Gordon had asked\n\nGrier to  forge the October  17, 1988 bond.   Although Gordon\n\nwas acquitted of  that forgery, he was convicted  of uttering\n\nthe  forged  bond,  and  the  Grier  testimony--elicited   by\n\nGordon's own  counsel--may have  helped  to confirm  Gordon's\n\nknowledge of the forgery.\n\n     After conviction  Gordon learned that  Grier, testifying\n\nin  the grand  jury prior  to trial,  had himself  denied any\n\nknowledge  of  the bond.    Gordon  moved  for a  new  trial,\n\ncontending that the government's failure to produce the grand\n\njury testimony at  trial as impeaching evidence  violated its\n\nobligation under  Brady.   In pre-trial  requests Gordon  had\n                       \n\nasked in general  terms for Brady material, but  he had never\n                                 \n\nspecifically  requested  production  of  prior statements  or\n\ntestimony by Grier.  The  district court denied the new trial\n\nmotion, citing United States v. Pandozzi, 878 F.2d  1526 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1989), and United States v. Carrasquillo-Plaza, 873 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n10 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                             -9-\n\n     Under the Jencks  Act, 18 U.S.C.   3500,  the government\n\nis required to produce prior statements by its own witnesses,\n\nwhether or  not the  statements are exculpatory.   And,  if a\n\nstatement is  itself exculpatory, the  government under Brady\n                                                             \n\nis normally required to produce it, regardless of  whether it\n\nis made by a trial witness. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 86.  Here,\n                                     \n\nsays the government, Grier's grand  jury testimony was not  a\n\nprior  statement  by   a  government  witness,  nor   was  it\n\nexculpatory in the sense that it disproved Gordon's guilt.   \n\n     Thus, in the government's view, the grand jury testimony\n\nis  merely newly discovered  impeaching evidence.   Under the\n\nWright-Martin  standard  for  a  new  trial  based  on  newly\n             \n\ndiscovered  evidence, the ordinary requisites for a new trial\n\non this ground  are specific and demanding.4   Gordon may not\n\nhave met any of the requisites, and he certainly did not meet\n            \n\nthe requirement  that the  newly discovered  evidence be  (at\n\nleast  in the  normal case)  \"not merely  . .  . impeaching.\"\n\nMartin, 815 F.2d at 824 (quoting Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n                                       \n\n                    \n\n     4A  new trial will ordinarily be denied absent a showing\nthat\n     (1)  the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the\n     defendant at the time of the trial;  (2) failure to\n     learn  of the  evidence  was  not  due to  lack  of\n     diligence  by the defendant;   (3) the  evidence is\n     material, and not  merely cumulative or impeaching;\n     and (4)  it will  probably result  in an  acquittal\n     upon retrial of the defendant.\n\nUnited States v.

Only  after\n\nGrier, as  a defense witness  for Stern, named Gordon  as the\n\nprocurer of the forgery did  the grand jury testimony take on\n\na potential as impeaching evidence.\n\n     The  government  protests   that  it   has  no   ongoing\n\nobligation  to monitor the testimony of defense witnesses and\n\nto  seek out prior  statements in its  files that  may in the\n\n                             -11-\n\ncourse of  trial  turn out  to  have impeachment  value  when\n\ndefense testimony injures  a defendant.  Even if  it did have\n\nsuch an obligation in some instances, there would be  serious\n\nquestions--not  easily answered  on  this record--whether  in\n\nthis   case  Gordon's  own   access  to  Grier   negated  the\n\nobligation, see United States v.  Hicks, 848 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1988), and whether the  failure of Gordon to request the\n\ngrand jury testimony  is also fatal to the Brady  claim.  Cf.\n                                                            \n\n18  U.S.C.    3500(b) (request  by  defendant required  under\n\nJencks Act); Carrasquillo-Plaza,  873 F.2d at 13  (failure to\n                               \n\nmake a specific request for alibi witness statements).\n\n     We think that these interesting questions had best await\n\nanother  occasion.   It  is  enough  in  this case  that  the\n\nimpeaching  evidence, even if made available to Gordon, could\n\nnot  conceivably have  altered the  outcome.   See  generally\n                                                             \n\nPandozzi, 878 F.2d at 1528-30.   The jury acquitted Gordon on\n                                                   \n\nthe counterfeiting  count despite Grier's  direct inculpation\n\nof Gordon; and the  knowledge element of the  uttering count,\n\non  which Gordon was  convicted, was confirmed  by the direct\n\ntestimony of another witness, Catalano,  as well as much else\n\nin Gordon's conduct.   Under Bagley, the  impeaching evidence\n                                   \n\ndoes  not remotely \"undermine confidence\" in the outcome. 473\n\nU.S. at 682.\n\n     The final issue in this  case is the most perplexing and\n\nrelates  solely   to  sentencing.     Under  the   Sentencing\n\n                             -12-\n\nGuidelines,5 the amount  of \"the loss\" is a  specific offense\n\ncharacteristic of crimes  involving fraud or deceit,  and the\n\nbase  offense level  (6 levels) is  increased by  a specified\n\nnumber of levels  (from 0 to 11  additional levels) depending\n\non the  amount of the  loss.  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1 (1988).   The\n\nadjusted  offense  level,  together  with  criminal  history,\n\ndetermines the sentencing range, and actual loss  may also be\n\nthe basis for a restitution order. 18 U.S.C.   3663(b)(1).\n\n     In  this  case, following  the pre-sentence  report, the\n\ndistrict court found  that the loss to  the Air Force  of the\n\nfraudulent  activities  in  this  case  was  \"the  difference\n\nbetween the bid price [by  Tower] and the award [to Fellsway,\n\nthe  second  lowest  bidder] for  $88,477,  increased  by the\n\nrestated administrative costs of $250\" involved in reawarding\n\nthe contract  to Fellsway.   The  resulting figure,  $88,727,\n\nincreased the  base offense  level from 6  to 11,  U.S.S.G.  \n\n2F1.1(b)(1) (1988), and  this in turn was increased  to 13 by\n\n                    \n\n     5The   pre-sentence   report   referred   to  the   1988\nguidelines,  which  were   in  effect  when  the   crime  was\ncommitted.    Current  practice  would  normally  invoke  the\nguidelines  in effect  at the  time  of sentencing--the  1991\nversion  for Stern and  the 1992 version  for Gordon--barring\nany ex post facto problems.  See Isabel v. United States, 980\n                                                        \nF.2d 60, 62  (1st Cir. 1992).   But since  the 1991 and  1992\nguidelines employ a  new loss/increase- in-level  table which\nwould have resulted  in a higher base offense  level for both\nStern and Gordon than provided for under the 1988 guidelines,\nwe  cite  to  the  1988   version.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                         \nHarotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1042 (1st Cir. 1990).\n          \n\n                             -13-\n\nthe  addition  of two  more  levels  for  \"more than  minimal\n\nplanning.\"  Id.   2F1.1(b)(2).\n               \n\n     The loss attributed to Stern may well have had no effect\n\non his sentence  of confinement; a downward  departure, based\n\non assistance to  the government, reduced his  confinement to\n\nbelow the minimum range that  would have prevailed if no loss\n                                                        \n\nhad  been   attributed  to   him.     Gordon's  sentence   of\n\nconfinement, also  based on  a downward  departure, might  or\n\nmight  not  have  been  affected  by  a  lower  loss  figure,\n\ndepending on  how small  a loss was  imputed.6  But  based on\n\nthe imputed loss of $88,727,  both defendants were ordered to\n\npay  restitution--Stern to pay $88,727 and Gordon $80,000--so\n\nthe importance of the loss figure is obvious.\n\n     At this  point, some procedural  history is needed.   In\n\nthe district  court, both  defendants challenged  the $88,727\n\nloss figure on somewhat different grounds.  Then, while these\n\nappeals were pending, someone apparently happened  upon Judge\n\nPosner's decision in United States v. Schneider, 930 F.2d 555\n                                               \n\n(7th Cir. 1991), which undoubtedly made the government uneasy\n\nabout the  loss calculation in this case.   In any event, the\n\ngovernment and  defendants entered into a  joint stipulation,\n\n                    \n\n     6Gordon's departure was based on the theory that the Air\nForce could  have rebid the  entire contract  for $10,000  (a\nfigure supplied by the Air Force), instead of merely awarding\nit  to the previous second lowest bidder.  Cf.  United States\n                                                             \nv.  Gregorio, 956  F.2d 341,  344-48  (1st Cir.  1992).   The\n            \ngovernment did not appeal this departure.\n\n                             -14-\n\nproposing  that this court  remand the case,  before deciding\n\nthe merits, for  resentencing in light of  Schneider; and the\n                                                    \n\nparties stipulated further that\n\n     1.   The parties  jointly stipulate  that the  best\n     readily  calculable measure  of the  loss from  the\n     offenses of  conviction, for  purposes of  applying\n     the  Sentencing  Guidelines,  is  $ 20,450.    This\n     amount  includes both an attempted gain of $ 20,200\n     (the purchase price for a  genuine bond of the kind\n     that  was   forged  in   this  case),   and  actual\n     consequential  losses  of  $  250 (the  immediately\n     identifiable administrative  costs associated  with\n     the  re-awarding  the   Photolab  contract).    For\n     purposes of ordering  restitution, only the  actual\n     loss figure, $ 250 is subject to restitution.\n\n     2.  The United States further reserves the right to\n     argue    that    the    stipulated    amount--while\n     representing   the   best   readily   ascertainable\n     estimate of  loss--understates the  full extent  of\n     the  loss in question.   The United  states further\n     reserves the right  to argue that, given  the small\n     sum of restitution payable, fines should be imposed\n     upon each  defendant, in an  amount to be  fixed in\n     light of the defendants' resources.\n\n     This court denied  the motion to remand,  believing that\n\nthe challenges to the convictions ought to be decided  before\n\nany remand for fine-tuning the  sentences.  Stern, taking the\n\nview  that the  stipulation  was binding  only if  this court\n\nordered an immediate remand, has  argued in his brief in this\n\ncourt that no  loss, apart perhaps from the  $250 involved in\n             \n\nshifting the  award to the  second bidder, has been  shown by\n\nthe government.  The government  adheres to its request for a\n\nremand in accordance with the stipulation, arguing that Stern\n\nhas waived  the contention  he now makes.   Gordon  has urged\n\nnothing beyond the stipulation.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     It would  be a  hazardous venture to  lay down  abstract\n\nrules  as  to  how  \"loss\"  is to  be  calculated  under  the\n\ngoverning guideline even if the focus were narrowed to  false\n\nstatements in bid  documents.  As Judge Posner  made clear in\n\nSchneider, the  underlying  facts  of  individual  cases  may\n         \n\ndiffer  widely, and even in comparable situations, what proof\n\nis available as to specific items of loss will vary from case\n\nto case. See 930 F.2d at  557-59.  Further, we note that  the\n            \n\ndeceptively simple notion  of \"loss\" is elaborated  under the\n\nguideline  to include situations  of foreseeable  or intended\n\nlosses, see U.S.S.G.   2F1.1,  application note 7 (1988), and\n           \n\nin later  versions to cover various specific  types of fraud,\n\ne.g.,  id.,  application  note 7(e)  (1993)  (Davis-Bacon Act\n          \n\nfraud).\n\n     If  we   agreed  with  the  district   court's  original\n\ncalculations of loss, we would not remand the case regardless\n\nof the stipulation of  the parties, since the parties  cannot\n\nby agreement create error where none exists.  On this record,\n\nhowever, we  think that  there is no  basis for  mechanically\n\nmeasuring the  loss as the  difference between the  two bids.\n\nThe problem is that the government never showed that it could\n\nhave secured a  bid from a properly bonded  contractor at the\n\nprice offered by Tower.  Without such evidence, it is hard to\n\nsee how  the government  can measure its  loss on  the theory\n\n                             -16-\n\nthat, but for  the fraud, it would have  enjoyed that initial\n\nlow price.7\n\n     On certain facts--say,  a general increase in  the level\n\nof  second  round bids  after  a  rebidding due  to  fraud--a\n\ncalculation  of  loss  based on  the  differential  between a\n\ntainted first-round best  bid and a higher  second-round best\n\nbid  might be entirely  persuasive.  But  here the government\n\nsimply  took  the   second  best  first-round  bid   with  no\n\nrebidding; and its administrative costs in shifting the award\n\nfrom Tower to  Fellsway were admittedly minimal ($250).   The\n\nprobation  reports and the  government urged the  loss figure\n\nadopted  by  the  district judge,  and  the  defendants while\n\nprotesting did  little to undermine  it.  Yet  the government\n\nitself no longer supports the $88,275 figure, and we can find\n\nno basis to sustain it on the present record.\n\n     Conversely, we reject Stern's \"no loss at all\" argument,\n\nat least so  far as concerns the guideline  calculation.  The\n\nsection  2F1.1 guideline  commentary,  from the  1988 version\n\n(application note 7)  to the present 1993 version  (id.), has\n                                                       \n\nincluded  the  \"probable\"  or \"intended\"  or  \"expected\" loss\n\n                    \n\n     7It is true that if the Amwest bond had been a real bond\ninstead of a forgery, then  the government would have enjoyed\nthe original  low price;  and in this  sense the  forgery may\nseem like the cause of that  loss.  But there is no  evidence\n    \nthat Tower Associates could ever  have secured a real bond by\na T-list surety or, if it could, that its bid would have been\nas low.  Indeed, Continental  seems to have been an off-shore\n\"front\" for contractors who could not get T-list bonding.\n\n                             -17-\n\nthreatened by a defendant's conduct as an alternative measure\n                                                     \n\nof  loss if that figure can be  determined and is larger than\n\nactual loss.  The evident purpose of the alternative is to be\n\ncertain  that attempted fraud does not escape all adjustments\n\nbased  on magnitude merely because the  fraud miscarried.  We\n\nthink that  this is  just such a  case where  the foreseeable\n\nloss exceeded the actual loss.\n\n     It was plainly foreseeable at the time of the fraud that\n\nthe Air Force might be deceived by the phony Amwest  bond and\n\nmight finally award the contract to Tower.  At that point, it\n\nis  hard  to know  the precise  risk of  loss imposed  on the\n\ngovernment,   for  it  would  depend  on  many  circumstances\n\nincluding the likelihood that Tower would flawlessly complete\n\nthe contract.  Yet \"the amount of loss  need not be precise,\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1, application  note 7  (1988); and,  broadly\n\nspeaking, to inflict  a phony  construction-contract bond  on\n\nthe government  exposes the government to the average cost of\n                                                     \n\nfailure to perform the contract adjusted  by the average risk\n                                                        \n\nof failure to  perform.  That adjusted figure  should also be\n\nthe approximate price of the average bond for such a project.\n\nOf  course, the  pertinent  figure  could  be higher  if  the\n\ngovernment  sought  to  prove  that  Tower  was  a  high-risk\n\ncontractor and would have been charged more for a valid bond.\n\n                             -18-\n\n     To assume that the phony bond might well be accepted is,\n\nin  a  case  like  this  one,  entirely  fair.    It  is  the\n\ndefendants' intended outcome and, given possible carelessness\n\nby administrators or merely a  good forgery, it is normally a\n\nrealistic likelihood.  From the standpoint of the guideline's\n\n\"intended or probable  loss\" criterion, we see  nothing wrong\n\nwith the use of the cost of  a valid bond as a fair proxy for\n\nthe potential loss  caused by the uttering of  the phony bond\n\nand forged  power of attorney.   In this case,  the potential\n\nwas not  realized, but  it was still  intended or  reasonably\n\nlikely and thus a proper measure of loss under the guideline.\n\n     Consequently, we think that the principle underlying the\n\nfirst paragraph  of the  quoted stipulation  is a  legitimate\n\nbasis in this case for calculating loss under  the guideline;\n\nwhether the  $20,200 figure is  binding on Stern is  a matter\n\nthat can be resolved on remand if Stern seeks to disclaim the\n\nstipulation.8  Of course,  the government did not offer  such\n\nevidence  of bond cost in the original sentencing proceeding;\n\nbut   where  a   sentence  is   vacated   and  remanded   for\n\nredetermination under  correct principles, the  government is\n\nnot automatically foreclosed from offering evidence pertinent\n\n                    \n\n     8The   district  court  is  not  required  to  accept  a\nstipulation on an issue of fact  pertinent to sentencing, but\nis free  to do  so given the  apparent reasonableness  of the\nproposed  figure.  This assumes, of course, either that Stern\nwithdraws his disclaimer (as he  would plainly be wise to do)\nor  that  the   district  court  decides  that   his  initial\nacceptance of the stipulation is binding in any event.\n\n                             -19-\n\nto the newly announced rule.  See United States v. Sepulveda,\n                                                            \n\n1993 U.S.  App. LEXIS  33020, *107 n.31  (1st Cir.,  Dec. 20,\n\n1993).\n\n     Restitution is  a different matter.   We agree  with the\n\ngovernment's  concession that  the intended or  probable loss\n\ncannot be  the measure of  restitution:  it  is one  thing to\n\nbase a criminal sentence on the magnitude  of threatened harm\n\nbut quite another to  \"restore\" to the government money  that\n\nit  never  lost.   Here,  the actual  loss  is only  the $250\n\nadministrative  cost of reawarding  the contract.   Given the\n\ncommon interrelationship  between fines  and restitution,  we\n\nsee no  reason why  the government should  not be  allowed to\n\nargue for a fine on remand.\n\n     Accordingly,  the judgment of conviction in each case is\n\naffirmed,  and the sentence and  the orders of restitution in\n        \n\neach  case  are  vacated  and  the  cases  are  remanded  for\n                                                        \n\nresentencing  in  accordance  with  this  opinion.    Further\n\nproceedings on remand are for the district court to determine\n\nin the first instance.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                     \n\n                             -20-\n",

The  Miller  Act,  40  U.S.C.\n                           \n\n   270a-f  requires all  contractors  bidding for  government\n\nconstruction   contracts  in  excess   of  $25,000   to  post\n\nperformance  and payment  bonds, and  the  Air Force  further\n\nrequires  that a  bid bond  accompany  the bid  itself.1   In\n\norder to qualify for  consideration, contractors must  submit\n\nbonds  issued  by  companies approved  by  the  United States\n\nTreasury  and listed  in  Treasury  Department Circular  570,\n\ncommonly called the \"T-list.\"  See  48 C.F.R.   28.202(a)(1).\n                                  \n\nThe  bonds  must  also be  submitted  on  standard government\n\nforms:   SF 24 (bid  bond), SF 25  (payment bond) and  SF 25A\n\n(performance bond).\n\n     Defendant  Lawrence  Gordon  was   the  head  of   Tower\n\nAssociates, Inc.,  a Winchester,  Massachusetts, construction\n\ncompany   seeking  to  secure   a  contract  to   renovate  a\n\nphotography  laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford,\n\nMassachusetts.  In September 1988 Tower submitted the low bid\n\nfor  the project,  offering to  perform  the renovations  for\n\n$1,000,200.  This bid was accompanied by a bid bond issued by\n\nContinental Surety Company, a surety or purported surety that\n\ndid  not appear  on the  T-list and  which apparently  had no\n\n                    \n\n     1\"Bid  bonds\"  ensure  that a  contractor  will  in fact\nundertake the contract if its bid is accepted;   \"performance\nbonds\"  guarantee  that  the  contractor  will  complete  the\nproject  in accordance with the specifications;  and \"payment\nbonds\" ensure that those who  furnish labor and materials for\nthe project will be paid.\n\n                             -2-\n\nassets.   The Air  Force employee responsible  for overseeing\n\nthe  bidding process, Lorraine  McLoughlin, did not  at first\n\nnotice  this problem  and Tower was  awarded the  contract on\n\nSeptember 30, 1988.\n\n     When   shortly   thereafter  McLoughlin   learned   that\n\nContinental was not an approved issuer, she called Gordon and\n\ninformed him that Tower's payment and performance bonds would\n\nhave to  be written by  a T-listed  company.  On  October 17,\n\n1988,  Gordon  presented  a  payment   and  performance  bond\n\npurportedly  issued by Amwest Surety Insurance Co., a company\n\nthat did appear on  the T-list.  The bond bore  Tower's seal,\n\nas well as the signatures of Gordon and one \"Alan Stime,\" who\n\nwas  listed as  Amwest's  attorney-in-fact.    The  bond  was\n\naccompanied  by a power of attorney, purportedly from Amwest,\n\nalso signed by \"Alan Stime.\"\n\n     The  Amwest bond and power of attorney were counterfeits\n\nfabricated by  James  Grier, the  principal  of  Continental.\n\nGrier later testified  at trial  that he  produced the  bogus\n\ndocuments  at Gordon's  request.   Sandra  Catalano, a  Tower\n\nemployee, testified  at trial that  she was present  when the\n\nbond was  signed by  Gordon  and defendant  Aaron Stern,  who\n\nsigned  the  bond as  \"Alan  Stime.\"    At trial,  an  Amwest\n\nofficial testified  that the bond  was not  a genuine  Amwest\n\nbond  and  that  no \"Alan  Stime\"  was  or ever  had  been an\n\nauthorized attorney in fact for Amwest.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The Air Force  rejected the phony bond  after McLoughlin\n\nnoted that some of  the signatures on the bond appeared to be\n\nfacsimiles  and that  the purported  Amwest  seal was  poorly\n\nimpressed and  illegible.   On October  19, 1988,  McLoughlin\n\nrequested that Tower resubmit its bonds and enclosed standard\n\ngovernment bond forms.   The Air Force received  a second set\n\nof bonds, on the government  forms, from Tower on October 24,\n\n1988.   These bonds were  also purportedly issued  by Amwest,\n\nbut the typed  name of the  attorney-in-fact under the  \"Alan\n\nStime\" signature was \"Aaron Stern.\"  By this time, McLoughlin\n\nhad been  told by an  Amwest employee that Amwest  \"had never\n\nheard of Tower Associates.\"\n\n     Rather than  accept the bonds, McLoughlin forwarded them\n\nto the  Air Force Office  of Investigations and sent  Tower a\n\nnotice to cure.   On November  18, 1988, McLoughlin  notified\n\nGordon of her  communications with Amwest.   After requesting\n\nan  extension  of  time  to  submit  new  bonds,  Tower  sent\n\nMcLoughlin  a  third  set  of  bonds on  December  13,  1988,\n\nexplaining that Tower  \"[had been] given a bond  which proved\n\ninvalid.\"   This third  set of bonds,  like the  original bid\n\nbond, was issued by Continental  and signed by Aaron Stern as\n\nattorney-in-fact.   As Continental  was still  not on  the T-\n\nlist, McLoughlin rejected the bonds.\n\n     The Air Force terminated Tower's award on March 3, 1989,\n\nand eventually  awarded the contract  (without rebidding)  to\n\n                             -4-\n\nFellsway,  Inc., which had  submitted the second  lowest bid.\n\nOn  June 13, 1991, Gordon and Stern  were charged in a multi-\n\ncount indictment with the following offenses:\n\n     Count 1   Gordon  and  Stern   were  both  charged  with\n               conspiring to defraud the United States in the\n               solicitation  and  award of  the  construction\n               contract at Hanscom Air Force  Base. 18 U.S.C.\n                 371 (conspiracy to defraud).\n\n     Count 2   Both    defendants    were     charged    with\n               counterfeiting the  October 17,  1988, payment\n               and  performance  bond purportedly  issued  by\n               Amwest Surety  Insurance Company. 18  U.S.C.  \n               494    (making,    uttering    or   presenting\n               counterfeit bond).\n\n     Count 3   Gordon was  charged with  knowingly presenting\n               the same counterfeit bond to the Air Force. 18\n               U.S.C.   494.\n\n     Count 4   Gordon  and  Stern  were  both  charged   with\n               uttering to  the Air Force a counterfeit power\n               of attorney. 18 U.S.C.   495 (making, uttering\n               or presenting counterfeit power of attorney).\n\n     Count 5   Both  defendants   were  charged   with  false\n               statements   in   completing   and  submitting\n               Standard  Form  25,  the government  form  for\n               performance bonds.   18  U.S.C.   1001  (false\n               statement statute).\n\n     Count 6   Both  defendants   were  charged   with  false\n               statements   in   completing   and  submitting\n               Standard  Form 25A,  the  government form  for\n               payment bonds.  18 U.S.C.   1001.\n\n     After a jury trial, Stern  was convicted on counts 1 and\n\n4, and acquitted on count 2. Gordon was convicted on count 3,\n\nand acquitted  on counts 1,  2 and 4.   Both  defendants were\n\nconvicted on Counts 5 and 6.  Gordon moved for a new trial on\n\nJune  19, 1992,  arguing  that  the  verdict  was  internally\n\ninconsistent and  that the  government had  withheld material\n\n                             -5-\n\nexculpatory  evidence.  The district court denied this motion\n\non December 18, 1992.\n\n     On  October 13, 1992, the district court sentenced Stern\n\nto  a 60-day  term of  imprisonment, along  with a  period of\n\nsupervised release.   Gordon  was sentenced  on November  24,\n\n1992, to  a 30-day  term of imprisonment  and nine  months of\n\nhome confinement.  Both defendants were also held jointly and\n\nseverally  liable  for  restitution.2    These   consolidated\n\nappeals followed.  Stern's counsel has briefed and argued the\n\ncase; Gordon, with  this court's permission, has  relied upon\n\nhis district court filings in support of a new trial.\n\n     In  this court  both  defendants  claim  that  the  jury\n\nverdicts are internally  inconsistent.  Gordon argued  in the\n\ndistrict court that since he was acquitted (under count 2) of\n\ncounterfeiting the October  17 bond, it was  inconsistent for\n\nthe jury then to convict him  (under count 3) of uttering the\n\nsame counterfeit bond.  Stern  points to his own acquittal of\n\nthe charge of counterfeiting  the bond (again under  count 2)\n\nand  protests that this acquittal undermines the jury verdict\n\nconvicting Stern (under  count 4) of uttering  a forged power\n\nof attorney in support of the same bond.\n\n                    \n\n     2Stern's  sentence  was  stayed  pending  appeal.    The\ndistrict  court denied Gordon's motion  for a similar stay on\nJanuary  19,  1993, but  this  court  stayed the  payment  of\nGordon's restitution pending appeal on August 24, 1993.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     Both objections lack  merit.  As the  defendants purport\n\nto recognize, general  jury verdicts may not  normally be set\n\naside for inconsistency as between counts.

But the\n\ninconsistent verdicts  were there  rendered by a  judge in  a\n                                                       \n\njury-waived trial.   The whole point of Maybury  is that (for\n                                               \n\nboth practical and historical reasons) the general verdict by\n\na jury  is a  special case but  a requirement  of consistency\n\ndoes apply to written findings  made by a single judge.   Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 903.\n\n     We  need not  discuss  other inconsistent-verdict  cases\n\ncited  by defendants  because,  as it  happens,  there is  no\n\nnecessary inconsistency in the verdicts  in this case.  As to\n\nGordon,  there  was  evidence  from  Grier  that  he  (Grier)\n\nfabricated the October 17, 1988, bond, but also evidence that\n\nGordon  knew it was counterfeit and nevertheless presented it\n\nto the Air Force.  The jury may have supposed (quite wrongly)\n\nthat Grier's admission entirely lifted responsibility for the\n\ncounterfeiting from Gordon's  shoulders but also  permissibly\n\n                             -7-\n\nbelieved  that  Gordon uttered  the  bond  knowing  it to  be\n\nforged.3\n\n     Similarly,  the  acquittal  of Stern  on  the  charge of\n\ncounterfeiting the same bond, again quite possibly because of\n\nGrier's admission,  is in  no way  inconsistent with  Stern's\n\nconviction for uttering  to the Air Force the companion power\n\nof attorney document knowing it to be forged.  In addition to\n\nother  evidence to support the uttering conviction, there was\n\ndirect  testimony  from Sandra  Catalano  that  Stern himself\n\nsigned the bond using the phony signature \"Alan Stime.\"  \n\n     Whether or  not Stern,  Gordon or  both could  have been\n\nconvicted of procuring or participating in the counterfeiting\n\nof the bond itself is irrelevant.  It is sufficient to dispel\n\nthe taint of inconsistency that a rational jury  could easily\n\nhave acquitted on count 2  while convicting Gordon on count 3\n\nand  Stern on  count 4.   And,  as explained  at the  outset,\n\ninconsistency  would   not   in  any   event  undermine   the\n\nconvictions  so  long as  they themselves  were, as  they are\n\nhere, supported by sufficient evidence.  See Powell, 469 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 67.\n\n                    \n\n     3Gordon's  claim that  the  conspiracy acquittal  (under\ncount  1) is inconsistent with the uttering conviction (under\ncount 3)  is even more  far-fetched.  True, the  uttering was\ncharged as an  act in furtherance  of the conspiracy.   But a\nliteral  minded jury might  believe that the  uttering itself\nwas   proved  amply  but  that  the  \"agreement\"  element  of\nconspiracy had not been established.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     Next,  Gordon claimed  in the  district  court that  the\n\ngovernment violated its obligation, under  Brady v. Maryland,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1963),  to  produce  exculpatory  evidence  by\n\nfailing to turn over the  grand jury testimony of Grier, whom\n\nStern called as  a witness.  The background is  this:  Grier,\n\ncalled by Stern as a defense witness, was then cross-examined\n\nby Gordon's counsel--not by the  government.  On this  cross-\n\nexamination, Grier proceeded to testify that Gordon had asked\n\nGrier to  forge the October  17, 1988 bond.   Although Gordon\n\nwas acquitted of  that forgery, he was convicted  of uttering\n\nthe  forged  bond,  and  the  Grier  testimony--elicited   by\n\nGordon's own  counsel--may have  helped  to confirm  Gordon's\n\nknowledge of the forgery.\n\n     After conviction  Gordon learned that  Grier, testifying\n\nin  the grand  jury prior  to trial,  had himself  denied any\n\nknowledge  of  the bond.    Gordon  moved  for a  new  trial,\n\ncontending that the government's failure to produce the grand\n\njury testimony at  trial as impeaching evidence  violated its\n\nobligation under  Brady.   In pre-trial  requests Gordon  had\n                       \n\nasked in general  terms for Brady material, but  he had never\n                                 \n\nspecifically  requested  production  of  prior statements  or\n\ntestimony by Grier.

And,  if a\n\nstatement is  itself exculpatory, the  government under Brady\n                                                             \n\nis normally required to produce it, regardless of  whether it\n\nis made by a trial witness. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 86.  Here,\n                                     \n\nsays the government, Grier's grand  jury testimony was not  a\n\nprior  statement  by   a  government  witness,  nor   was  it\n\nexculpatory in the sense that it disproved Gordon's guilt.   \n\n     Thus, in the government's view, the grand jury testimony\n\nis  merely newly discovered  impeaching evidence.   Under the\n\nWright-Martin  standard  for  a  new  trial  based  on  newly\n             \n\ndiscovered  evidence, the ordinary requisites for a new trial\n\non this ground  are specific and demanding.4   Gordon may not\n\nhave met any of the requisites, and he certainly did not meet\n            \n\nthe requirement  that the  newly discovered  evidence be  (at\n\nleast  in the  normal case)  \"not merely  . .  . impeaching.\"\n\nMartin, 815 F.2d at 824 (quoting Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n                                       \n\n                    \n\n     4A  new trial will ordinarily be denied absent a showing\nthat\n     (1)  the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the\n     defendant at the time of the trial;  (2) failure to\n     learn  of the  evidence  was  not  due to  lack  of\n     diligence  by the defendant;   (3) the  evidence is\n     material, and not  merely cumulative or impeaching;\n     and (4)  it will  probably result  in an  acquittal\n     upon retrial of the defendant.\n\nUnited States v.

It  is  enough  in  this case  that  the\n\nimpeaching  evidence, even if made available to Gordon, could\n\nnot  conceivably have  altered the  outcome.

Under Bagley, the  impeaching evidence\n                                   \n\ndoes  not remotely \"undermine confidence\" in the outcome. 473\n\nU.S. at 682.\n\n     The final issue in this  case is the most perplexing and\n\nrelates  solely   to  sentencing.     Under  the   Sentencing\n\n                             -12-\n\nGuidelines,5 the amount  of \"the loss\" is a  specific offense\n\ncharacteristic of crimes  involving fraud or deceit,  and the\n\nbase  offense level  (6 levels) is  increased by  a specified\n\nnumber of levels  (from 0 to 11  additional levels) depending\n\non the  amount of the  loss.  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1 (1988).   The\n\nadjusted  offense  level,  together  with  criminal  history,\n\ndetermines the sentencing range, and actual loss  may also be\n\nthe basis for a restitution order. 18 U.S.C.   3663(b)(1).\n\n     In  this  case, following  the pre-sentence  report, the\n\ndistrict court found  that the loss to  the Air Force  of the\n\nfraudulent  activities  in  this  case  was  \"the  difference\n\nbetween the bid price [by  Tower] and the award [to Fellsway,\n\nthe  second  lowest  bidder] for  $88,477,  increased  by the\n\nrestated administrative costs of $250\" involved in reawarding\n\nthe contract  to Fellsway.   The  resulting figure,  $88,727,\n\nincreased the  base offense  level from 6  to 11,  U.S.S.G.  \n\n2F1.1(b)(1) (1988), and  this in turn was increased  to 13 by\n\n                    \n\n     5The   pre-sentence   report   referred   to  the   1988\nguidelines,  which  were   in  effect  when  the   crime  was\ncommitted.

The\n            \ngovernment did not appeal this departure.\n\n                             -14-\n\nproposing  that this court  remand the case,  before deciding\n\nthe merits, for  resentencing in light of  Schneider; and the\n                                                    \n\nparties stipulated further that\n\n     1.

This\n     amount  includes both an attempted gain of $ 20,200\n     (the purchase price for a  genuine bond of the kind\n     that  was   forged  in   this  case),   and  actual\n     consequential  losses  of  $  250 (the  immediately\n     identifiable administrative  costs associated  with\n     the  re-awarding  the   Photolab  contract).    For\n     purposes of ordering  restitution, only the  actual\n     loss figure, $ 250 is subject to restitution.\n\n     2.  The United States further reserves the right to\n     argue    that    the    stipulated    amount--while\n     representing   the   best   readily   ascertainable\n     estimate of  loss--understates the  full extent  of\n     the  loss in question.   The United  states further\n     reserves the right  to argue that, given  the small\n     sum of restitution payable, fines should be imposed\n     upon each  defendant, in an  amount to be  fixed in\n     light of the defendants' resources.\n\n     This court denied  the motion to remand,  believing that\n\nthe challenges to the convictions ought to be decided  before\n\nany remand for fine-tuning the  sentences.  Stern, taking the\n\nview  that the  stipulation  was binding  only if  this court\n\nordered an immediate remand, has  argued in his brief in this\n\ncourt that no  loss, apart perhaps from the  $250 involved in\n             \n\nshifting the  award to the  second bidder, has been  shown by\n\nthe government.  The government  adheres to its request for a\n\nremand in accordance with the stipulation, arguing that Stern\n\nhas waived  the contention  he now makes.   Gordon  has urged\n\nnothing beyond the stipulation.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     It would  be a  hazardous venture to  lay down  abstract\n\nrules  as  to  how  \"loss\"  is to  be  calculated  under  the\n\ngoverning guideline even if the focus were narrowed to  false\n\nstatements in bid  documents.  As Judge Posner  made clear in\n\nSchneider, the  underlying  facts  of  individual  cases  may\n         \n\ndiffer  widely, and even in comparable situations, what proof\n\nis available as to specific items of loss will vary from case\n\nto case. See 930 F.2d at  557-59.  Further, we note that  the\n            \n\ndeceptively simple notion  of \"loss\" is elaborated  under the\n\nguideline  to include situations  of foreseeable  or intended\n\nlosses, see U.S.S.G.   2F1.1,  application note 7 (1988), and\n           \n\nin later  versions to cover various specific  types of fraud,\n\ne.g.,  id.,  application  note 7(e)  (1993)  (Davis-Bacon Act\n          \n\nfraud).\n\n     If  we   agreed  with  the  district   court's  original\n\ncalculations of loss, we would not remand the case regardless\n\nof the stipulation of  the parties, since the parties  cannot\n\nby agreement create error where none exists.  On this record,\n\nhowever, we  think that  there is no  basis for  mechanically\n\nmeasuring the  loss as the  difference between the  two bids.\n\nThe problem is that the government never showed that it could\n\nhave secured a  bid from a properly bonded  contractor at the\n\nprice offered by Tower.  Without such evidence, it is hard to\n\nsee how  the government  can measure its  loss on  the theory\n\n                             -16-\n\nthat, but for  the fraud, it would have  enjoyed that initial\n\nlow price.7\n\n     On certain facts--say,  a general increase in  the level\n\nof  second  round bids  after  a  rebidding due  to  fraud--a\n\ncalculation  of  loss  based on  the  differential  between a\n\ntainted first-round best  bid and a higher  second-round best\n\nbid  might be entirely  persuasive.  But  here the government\n\nsimply  took  the   second  best  first-round  bid   with  no\n\nrebidding; and its administrative costs in shifting the award\n\nfrom Tower to  Fellsway were admittedly minimal ($250).   The\n\nprobation  reports and the  government urged the  loss figure\n\nadopted  by  the  district judge,  and  the  defendants while\n\nprotesting did  little to undermine  it.  Yet  the government\n\nitself no longer supports the $88,275 figure, and we can find\n\nno basis to sustain it on the present record.\n\n     Conversely, we reject Stern's \"no loss at all\" argument,\n\nat least so  far as concerns the guideline  calculation.  The\n\nsection  2F1.1 guideline  commentary,  from the  1988 version\n\n(application note 7)  to the present 1993 version  (id.), has\n                                                       \n\nincluded  the  \"probable\"  or \"intended\"  or  \"expected\" loss\n\n                    \n\n     7It is true that if the Amwest bond had been a real bond\ninstead of a forgery, then  the government would have enjoyed\nthe original  low price;  and in this  sense the  forgery may\nseem like the cause of that  loss.  But there is no  evidence\n    \nthat Tower Associates could ever  have secured a real bond by\na T-list surety or, if it could, that its bid would have been\nas low.  Indeed, Continental  seems to have been an off-shore\n\"front\" for contractors who could not get T-list bonding.\n\n                             -17-\n\nthreatened by a defendant's conduct as an alternative measure\n                                                     \n\nof  loss if that figure can be  determined and is larger than\n\nactual loss.  The evident purpose of the alternative is to be\n\ncertain  that attempted fraud does not escape all adjustments\n\nbased  on magnitude merely because the  fraud miscarried.  We\n\nthink that  this is  just such a  case where  the foreseeable\n\nloss exceeded the actual loss.\n\n     It was plainly foreseeable at the time of the fraud that\n\nthe Air Force might be deceived by the phony Amwest  bond and\n\nmight finally award the contract to Tower.  At that point, it\n\nis  hard  to know  the precise  risk of  loss imposed  on the\n\ngovernment,   for  it  would  depend  on  many  circumstances\n\nincluding the likelihood that Tower would flawlessly complete\n\nthe contract.  Yet \"the amount of loss  need not be precise,\"\n\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1, application  note 7  (1988); and,  broadly\n\nspeaking, to inflict  a phony  construction-contract bond  on\n\nthe government  exposes the government to the average cost of\n                                                     \n\nfailure to perform the contract adjusted  by the average risk\n                                                        \n\nof failure to  perform.  That adjusted figure  should also be\n\nthe approximate price of the average bond for such a project.\n\nOf  course, the  pertinent  figure  could  be higher  if  the\n\ngovernment  sought  to  prove  that  Tower  was  a  high-risk\n\ncontractor and would have been charged more for a valid bond.\n\n                             -18-\n\n     To assume that the phony bond might well be accepted is,\n\nin  a  case  like  this  one,  entirely  fair.    It  is  the\n\ndefendants' intended outcome and, given possible carelessness\n\nby administrators or merely a  good forgery, it is normally a\n\nrealistic likelihood.  From the standpoint of the guideline's\n\n\"intended or probable  loss\" criterion, we see  nothing wrong\n\nwith the use of the cost of  a valid bond as a fair proxy for\n\nthe potential loss  caused by the uttering of  the phony bond\n\nand forged  power of attorney.   In this case,  the potential\n\nwas not  realized, but  it was still  intended or  reasonably\n\nlikely and thus a proper measure of loss under the guideline.\n\n     Consequently, we think that the principle underlying the\n\nfirst paragraph  of the  quoted stipulation  is a  legitimate\n\nbasis in this case for calculating loss under  the guideline;\n\nwhether the  $20,200 figure is  binding on Stern is  a matter\n\nthat can be resolved on remand if Stern seeks to disclaim the\n\nstipulation.8  Of course,  the government did not offer  such\n\nevidence  of bond cost in the original sentencing proceeding;\n\nbut   where  a   sentence  is   vacated   and  remanded   for\n\nredetermination under  correct principles, the  government is\n\nnot automatically foreclosed from offering evidence pertinent\n\n                    \n\n     8The   district  court  is  not  required  to  accept  a\nstipulation on an issue of fact  pertinent to sentencing, but\nis free  to do  so given the  apparent reasonableness  of the\nproposed  figure.  This assumes, of course, either that Stern\nwithdraws his disclaimer (as he  would plainly be wise to do)\nor  that  the   district  court  decides  that   his  initial\nacceptance of the stipulation is binding in any event.\n\n                             -19-\n\nto the newly announced rule.  See United States v. Sepulveda,\n                                                            \n\n1993 U.S.  App. LEXIS  33020, *107 n.31  (1st Cir.,  Dec. 20,\n\n1993).\n\n     Restitution is  a different matter.   We agree  with the\n\ngovernment's  concession that  the intended or  probable loss\n\ncannot be  the measure of  restitution:  it  is one  thing to\n\nbase a criminal sentence on the magnitude  of threatened harm\n\nbut quite another to  \"restore\" to the government money  that\n\nit  never  lost.   Here,  the actual  loss  is only  the $250\n\nadministrative  cost of reawarding  the contract.   Given the\n\ncommon interrelationship  between fines  and restitution,  we\n\nsee no  reason why  the government should  not be  allowed to\n\nargue for a fine on remand.\n\n     Accordingly,  the judgment of conviction in each case is\n\naffirmed,  and the sentence and  the orders of restitution in\n        \n\neach  case  are  vacated  and  the  cases  are  remanded  for\n                                                        \n\nresentencing  in  accordance  with  this  opinion.    Further\n\nproceedings on remand are for the district court to determine\n\nin the first instance.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                     \n\n                             -20-\n</pre>",
