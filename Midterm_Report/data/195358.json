Brookhart and  Scott P. Towers, Attorneys,  Tax\n                                              \nDivision, Department of Justice on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant Brian Gardell appeals an order of\n               \n\nthe  United States  District Court  for  the District  of New\n\nHampshire  approving the  report  and recommendation  of  the\n\nmagistrate  judge that  he  comply with  an Internal  Revenue\n\nService [IRS]  summons issued pursuant  to 26 U.S.C.    7602.\n\nThe administrative  summons directs Gardell to  appear at the\n\nIRS office  in Portsmouth,  New Hampshire, to  give testimony\n\nand to produce for examination books and  records relating to\n\nhis  tax  liabilities  for the  years  1985  and  1987.   Tax\n\nliabilities had previously been assessed against Gardell  for\n\nthese years and the  purpose of the summons was  to determine\n\nthe collectability of these  liabilities.  On appeal, Gardell\n\nasserts  that  the  district  court  lacked  jurisdiction  to\n\nenforce the  summons since Gardell has  the \"Status . .  . of\n\nFreeman and  . . .  has no Contractual,  Quasi-Contractual or\n\nimplied  agreements with  the Federal  Government.\"   He also\n\ncontends  that the  enforcement of  the summons  violated his\n\nconstitutional right  to due process.   We affirm essentially\n\non the grounds stated  by the magistrate judge in  his report\n\nand  recommendation  dated July  7, 1993.    We add  only the\n\nfollowing remarks.\n\n     First, Gardell's contention that as  a \"Freeman\" without\n\ncontractual obligations  to the government he  is not subject\n\n                             -2-\n\nto  the  district  court's  jurisdiction is  totally  without\n\nmerit.1  See  United States  v. Sloan, 939  F.2d 499,  500-01\n                                     \n\n(7th  Cir. 1991)  (contention  that appellant  was free  from\n\nincome  tax because he was a \"freeborn, natural individual  .\n\n. . [and thus] not subject to the jurisdiction of laws of the\n\nUnited  States\" is  frivolous), cert.  denied, 112  S.Ct. 940\n                                             \n\n(1992);  United States v. Drefke, 707 F.2d 978, 981 (8th Cir.\n                                \n\n1983) (claim that \"taxes are debts which can only be incurred\n\nvoluntarily when individuals contract with the government for\n\nservices . .  . is  totally without  arguable merit\"),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied,  464 U.S. 942 (1983).  The district court has subject\n      \n\nmatter  over  a petition  to  enforce  an IRS  administrative\n\nsummons  pursuant  to  26  U.S.C.     7604(a).    It acquired\n\npersonal jurisdiction  over Gardell through service  upon him\n\nof  the show  cause  order and  the petition  of enforcement.\n\nUnited  States v.  Bichara, 826  F.2d 1037,  1039  (11th Cir.\n                          \n\n1987); United States v.  Miller, 609 F.2d 336, 338  (8th Cir.\n                               \n\n1979).    \n\n     Second,  the record makes clear that the IRS has met its\n\nburden  of establishing a prima facie case for enforcement of\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n1.  Similarly  frivolous  is  Gardell's  contention  that the\ntaxing of wages  is unconstitutional.   See, e.g., Wilcox  v.\n                                                         \nCommissioner, 848 F.2d 1007, 1008 (9th Cir. 1988) (contention\n            \nthat wages  are not  income for  tax purposes  is frivolous);\nCasper v. Commissioner,  805 F.2d 902,  906 (10th Cir.  1986)\n                      \n(appellant's  contention that  amount  he  received from  his\nemployer is  not taxable  income is \"clearly  without merit\")\n(citing cases).\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe administrative summons  as set  out in  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nPowell, 379 U.S.  48 (1964).   See also  Sylvestre v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  978 F.2d 25, 26  (1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 113\n                                                        \n\nS.Ct.  1606 (1993).    Gardell,  who  concedes that  the  IRS\n\nsatisfied these requirements, thereupon  bears the burden  of\n\nshowing,  by  an  allegation  of  specific  facts,  that  the\n\nenforcement  of the summons would  constitute an abuse of the\n\ncourt's process--\"that  is, that the summons  had been issued\n\nfor an improper purpose  or for any other purpose  reflecting\n\non  the good faith of  the investigation.\" Id.  at 27 (citing\n                                             \n\nPowell, 379 U.S. at  58).  The only arguments  Gardell raised\n      \n\nin  this  regard  either  before this  court  or  before  the\n\ndistrict court challenge the  liabilities which were assessed\n\nagainst  him and  which  underlie the  summons.   However,  a\n\nchallenge  to an assessment of liability  can only be brought\n\nin Tax Court within ninety days of the mailing of a notice of\n\ndeficiency, see 26 U.S.C.    6213(a), or before the  district\n               \n\ncourt after the payment of the  tax, id.   7422 (until tax is\n                                       \n\npaid, district  court without jurisdiction to hear allegation\n\nthat  tax has been erroneously  assessed).2    A challenge to\n\nthe  underlying assessment  is  not a  valid  defense to  the\n\nenforcement of an  administrative summons,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n2.  There is no evidence that Gardell  ever attempted to file\na petition  for redetermination  of his liabilities  with the\nTax  Court.   According to  this IRS,  the time  to challenge\nGardell's tax liability in Tax Court has now passed.\n\n                             -4-\n\nHarper,  662  F.2d  335, 336  (5th  Cir.  1981) (per  curiam)\n                                                            \n\n(taxpayer challenge to underlying assessment does not suffice\n\nto  meet  his  burden  to  show  improper  purpose),  and  is\n\nmisplaced in an appeal from a district court order  enforcing\n\none,  United States  v. Mueller,  930 F.2d  10, 12  (8th Cir.\n                               \n\n1991)  (\"district court  correctly  held  that [the  summoned\n\nparty]  could  not use  the  proceedings to  enforce  the IRS\n\nsummons as a forum  in which to contest  the validity of  the\n\nunderlying assessments.\").    Since Gardell  was afforded  an\n\nopportunity  to challenge  the  administrative summons  in an\n\nadversarial proceeding before the district court prior to the\n\nenforcement of the summons, he suffered no deprivation of his\n\nconstitutional right to due process.  See Reisman v.  Caplin,\n                                                            \n\n375  U.S.   440,  446,   449-50  (1964)   (no  constitutional\n\ninvalidity  in  procedure for  enforcement  of  summons since\n\nthere  is \"full  opportunity for  judicial review  before any\n\ncoercive  sanctions  may  be  imposed\");  United  States   v.\n                                                        \n\nGilleran, 992 F.2d 232,  233-34 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"no  liberty\n        \n\nor property interest protectable by due  process prior to the\n\nenforcement of the summons\") .\n\n     Finally,  the IRS  asks this  court to  impose sanctions\n\nagainst appellant for bringing a frivolous appeal.  Gardell's\n\nchallenges to the administrative summons are frivolous and/or\n\nmisplaced.   Both this court and others have not hesitated to\n\nimpose sanctions for similarly frivolous appeals.  See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\n                             -5-\n\nKelly  v.  United States,  789 F.2d  94,  98 (1st  Cir. 1986)\n                        \n\n(imposing sanctions on appellant  who claimed that because he\n\nwas  a \"natural  individual  and unenfranchised  freeman\" who\n\nneither asked for nor  received privileges from government he\n\nowed  no tax); Sullivan v.  United States, 788  F.2d 813, 816\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986) (similar); see also Wilcox, 848 F.2d at 1008\n                                           \n\n(appellant  contended wages  are  not income  and payment  of\n\ntaxes is voluntary); Casper v.

Although the Government seeks $1,500 in lieu of costs\n\nand attorneys' fees, we, in accord with our prior practice in\n\nsimilar cases,  assess only double costs  against Gardell for\n\nbringing a frivolous appeal.  Fed. R. App. P. 38.\n\n     The judgment of the district  court is affirmed.  Double\n                                                             \n\ncosts are assessed against appellant.\n                                    \n\n                             -6-\n",

Sec. 7602.  The administrative summons directs Gardell to appear at the IRS office in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to give testimony and to produce for examination books and records relating to his tax liabilities for the years 1985 and 1987.  Tax liabilities had previously been assessed against Gardell for these years and the purpose of the summons was to determine the collectability of these liabilities.  On appeal, Gardell asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the summons since Gardell has the \"Status ... of Freeman and ... has no Contractual, Quasi-Contractual or implied agreements with the Federal Government.\"  He also contends that the enforcement of the summons violated his constitutional right to due process.  We affirm essentially on the grounds stated by the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation dated July 7, 1993.  We add only the following remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Gardell's contention that as a \"Freeman\" without contractual obligations to the government he is not subject to the district court's jurisdiction is totally without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   See United States v. Sloan, 939 F.2d 499, 500-01 (7th Cir. 1991) (contention that appellant was free from income tax because he was a \"freeborn, natural individual ... [and thus] not subject to the jurisdiction of laws of the United States\" is frivolous), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 940 (1992);   United States v. Drefke, 707 F.2d 978, 981 (8th Cir. 1983) (claim that \"taxes are debts which can only be incurred voluntarily when individuals contract with the government for services ... is totally without arguable merit\"), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 942 (1983).  The district court has subject matter over a petition to enforce an IRS administrative summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a).  It acquired personal jurisdiction over Gardell through service upon him of the show cause order and the petition of enforcement.  United States v.  Bichara, 826 F.2d 1037, 1039 (11th Cir. 1987);  United States v.  Miller, 609 F.2d 336, 338 (8th Cir. 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record makes clear that the IRS has met its burden of establishing a prima facie case for enforcement of the administrative summons as set out in United States v.  Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964).   See also Sylvestre v. United States, 978 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1606 (1993).  Gardell, who concedes that the IRS satisfied these requirements, thereupon bears the burden of showing, by an allegation of specific facts, that the enforcement of the summons would constitute an abuse of the court's process-\"that is, that the summons had been issued for an improper purpose or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the investigation.\"  Id. at 27 (citing  Powell, 379 U.S. at 58).  The only arguments Gardell raised in this regard either before this court or before the district court challenge the liabilities which were assessed against him and which underlie the summons.  However, a challenge to an assessment of liability can only be brought in Tax Court within ninety days of the mailing of a notice of deficiency, see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6213(a), or before the district court after the payment of the tax, id. Sec. 7422 (until tax is paid, district court without jurisdiction to hear allegation that tax has been erroneously assessed).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A challenge to the underlying assessment is not a valid defense to the enforcement of an administrative summons,  United States v. Harper, 662 F.2d 335, 336 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam ) (taxpayer challenge to underlying assessment does not suffice to meet his burden to show improper purpose), and is misplaced in an appeal from a district court order enforcing one,  United States v. Mueller, 930 F.2d 10, 12 (8th Cir. 1991) (\"district court correctly held that [the summoned party] could not use the proceedings to enforce the IRS summons as a forum in which to contest the validity of the underlying assessments.\").  Since Gardell was afforded an opportunity to challenge the administrative summons in an adversarial proceeding before the district court prior to the enforcement of the summons, he suffered no deprivation of his constitutional right to due process.   See Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 446, 449-50 (1964) (no constitutional invalidity in procedure for enforcement of summons since there is \"full opportunity for judicial review before any coercive sanctions may be imposed\");   United States v.

Sec. 7602.  The administrative summons directs Gardell to appear at the IRS office in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to give testimony and to produce for examination books and records relating to his tax liabilities for the years 1985 and 1987.  Tax liabilities had previously been assessed against Gardell for these years and the purpose of the summons was to determine the collectability of these liabilities.  On appeal, Gardell asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the summons since Gardell has the \"Status ... of Freeman and ... has no Contractual, Quasi-Contractual or implied agreements with the Federal Government.\"  He also contends that the enforcement of the summons violated his constitutional right to due process.  We affirm essentially on the grounds stated by the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation dated July 7, 1993.  We add only the following remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Gardell's contention that as a \"Freeman\" without contractual obligations to the government he is not subject to the district court's jurisdiction is totally without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   See United States v. Sloan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565044\"><a href=\"/opinion/565044/united-states-v-lorin-g-sloan/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 500-01 (7th Cir. 1991) (contention that appellant was free from income tax because he was a \"freeborn, natural individual ... [and thus] not subject to the jurisdiction of laws of the United States\" is frivolous), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span> (1992);   United States v. Drefke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418769\"><a href=\"/opinion/418769/united-states-v-paul-m-drefke-united-states-of-america-v-richard-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span>, 981 (8th Cir. 1983) (claim that \"taxes are debts which can only be incurred voluntarily when individuals contract with the government for services ... is totally without arguable merit\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111076\"><a href=\"/opinion/111076/v-louise-mccarren-v-town-of-springfield-vermont-and-vermont-public-power/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span> (1983).  The district court has subject matter over a petition to enforce an IRS administrative summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7604(a).  It acquired personal jurisdiction over Gardell through service upon him of the show cause order and the petition of enforcement.  United States v.  Bichara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492769\"><a href=\"/opinion/492769/united-states-of-america-and-joel-cohen-revenue-officer-of-the-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span>, 1039 (11th Cir. 1987);  United States v.  Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371430\"><a href=\"/opinion/371430/united-states-of-america-and-john-dezelar-revenue-agent-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 338 (8th Cir. 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record makes clear that the IRS has met its burden of establishing a prima facie case for enforcement of the administrative summons as set out in United States v.  Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106933\"><a href=\"/opinion/106933/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span> (1964).   See also Sylvestre v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593293\"><a href=\"/opinion/593293/roger-sylvestre-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1606</span></span> (1993).  Gardell, who concedes that the IRS satisfied these requirements, thereupon bears the burden of showing, by an allegation of specific facts, that the enforcement of the summons would constitute an abuse of the court's process-\"that is, that the summons had been issued for an improper purpose or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the investigation.\"  Id. at 27 (citing  Powell, 379 U.S. at 58).  The only arguments Gardell raised in this regard either before this court or before the district court challenge the liabilities which were assessed against him and which underlie the summons.  However, a challenge to an assessment of liability can only be brought in Tax Court within ninety days of the mailing of a notice of deficiency, see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6213(a), or before the district court after the payment of the tax, id. Sec. 7422 (until tax is paid, district court without jurisdiction to hear allegation that tax has been erroneously assessed).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  A challenge to the underlying assessment is not a valid defense to the enforcement of an administrative summons,  United States v. Harper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396217\"><a href=\"/opinion/396217/united-states-of-america-and-t-b-schopfer-revenue-officer-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 336 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam ) (taxpayer challenge to underlying assessment does not suffice to meet his burden to show improper purpose), and is misplaced in an appeal from a district court order enforcing one,  United States v. Mueller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558691\"><a href=\"/opinion/558691/united-states-of-america-and-rogerlyn-p-greason-revenue-officer-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 (8th Cir. 1991) (\"district court correctly held that [the summoned party] could not use the proceedings to enforce the IRS summons as a forum in which to contest the validity of the underlying assessments.\").  Since Gardell was afforded an opportunity to challenge the administrative summons in an adversarial proceeding before the district court prior to the enforcement of the summons, he suffered no deprivation of his constitutional right to due process.   See Reisman v. Caplin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106730\"><a href=\"/opinion/106730/reisman-v-caplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 446, 449-50 (1964) (no constitutional invalidity in procedure for enforcement of summons since there is \"full opportunity for judicial review before any coercive sanctions may be imposed\");   United States v. Gilleran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605668\"><a href=\"/opinion/605668/united-states-v-robert-t-gilleran/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 233- 34 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"no liberty or property interest protectable by due process prior to the enforcement of the summons\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IRS asks this court to impose sanctions against appellant for bringing a frivolous appeal.  Gardell's challenges to the administrative summons are frivolous and/or misplaced.  Both this court and others have not hesitated to impose sanctions for similarly frivolous appeals.  See, e.g.,  Kelly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469061\"><a href=\"/opinion/469061/susan-b-kelly-v-united-states-of-america-james-p-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir. 1986) (imposing sanctions on appellant who claimed that because he was a \"natural individual and unenfranchised freeman\" who neither asked for nor received privileges from government he owed no tax);   Sullivan v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468729\"><a href=\"/opinion/468729/grant-w-sullivan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 816 (1st Cir. 1986) (similar);  see also Wilcox, 848 F.2d at 1008 (appellant contended wages are not income and payment of taxes is voluntary);  Casper v. Commissioner, 805 F.2d at 906 (similar).  We agree that sanctions are warranted in this case.  Although the Government seeks $1,500 in lieu of costs and attorneys' fees, we, in accord with our prior practice in similar cases, assess only double costs against Gardell for bringing a frivolous appeal.  Fed. R. App.  P. 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Double costs are assessed against appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Similarly frivolous is Gardell's contention that the taxing of wages is unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Wilcox v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507193\"><a href=\"/opinion/507193/robert-p-wilcox-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1008 (9th Cir. 1988) (contention that wages are not income for tax purposes is frivolous);   Casper v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479442\"><a href=\"/opinion/479442/john-m-casper-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span>, 906 (10th Cir. 1986) (appellant's contention that amount he received from his employer is not taxable income is \"clearly without merit\") (citing cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is no evidence that Gardell ever attempted to file a petition for redetermination of his liabilities with the Tax Court.  According to this IRS, the time to challenge Gardell's tax liability in Tax Court has now passed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
