Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella* and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert I.

Munich, Lillian\nFrattallone, José Bagué, Iris J. Cabrera, and Rivera, Tulla &\nFerrer were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 5, 2010\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Circuit Judge Torruella heard oral argument in this matter\nand thereafter recused himself.     The remaining two panelists\ntherefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(d).\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This dispute arose after plaintiff\n\nWells Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (Wells) entered into an\n\nagreement    with   defendant   Chardón/Hato   Rey   Partnership,   S.E.\n\n(Chardón) for the purchase of a commercial building in San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico.    Prior to the expected closing date, a large fuel\n\nspill occurred at the property, causing significant damage and\n\ndisplacing the building's tenants.       Chardón insisted on proceeding\n\nto closing over Wells' objections.        After Wells failed to appear\n\nfor the scheduled closing, both parties filed claims for breach of\n\ncontract.\n\n            Wells appeals from the court's grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of Chardón on Wells' claims for breach and resolution of\n\ncontract and Chardón's counter-claim for breach of contract. After\n\ncareful review, we affirm the judgment in part, vacate in part, and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA. The Purchase and Sale Agreement\n\n            On January 25, 2008, Wells entered into a Purchase and\n\nSale Agreement (the Agreement) with Chardón by which Wells agreed\n\nto purchase the American International Plaza building in San Juan\n\n(AI Plaza) for $80 million.        Pursuant to the Agreement, Wells\n\nplaced a $4 million deposit in escrow and agreed to pay the $76\n\nmillion balance at closing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            Section 2.1 of the Agreement defined the \"Property\" that\n\nWells agreed to purchase from Chardón:\n\n            2.1    Property.    Subject to the terms and\n            conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to\n            sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to\n            purchase from Seller, the Real Property, the\n            Improvements, and all of Seller's right,\n            title, and interest in the Leases, in the\n            Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible\n            Personal   Property,   and  in   the   Service\n            Contracts (as such terms are defined below)\n            (all of which are collectively referred to as\n            the \"Property\").\n\n            Article 6 of the Agreement addressed \"OPERATIONS AND RISK\n\nOF LOSS.\"    Section 6.1.3 set forth Chardón's ongoing maintenance\n\nobligations from the effective date of the Agreement, January 25,\n\nthrough closing:\n\n            6.1.3. Maintenance of Improvements; Removal of\n            Personal Property.    Subject to Sections 6.2\n            and 6.3, Seller shall maintain or cause the\n            tenants under the Leases to maintain (to the\n            extent   provided    in   such   Leases)   all\n            Improvements substantially in their present\n            condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty\n            excepted) and in a manner consistent with\n            Seller's maintenance of the Improvements\n            during Seller's period of ownership. Seller\n            will not remove any Tangible Personal Property\n            except as may be required for necessary repair\n            or replacement.\n\n            Section 6.2, entitled \"Damage,\" set forth the parties'\n\nrights and obligations in the event that \"prior to Closing the\n\nProperty is damaged by fire or other casualty.\"   If such a casualty\n\noccurred, \"Seller shall estimate the cost to repair and the time\n\nrequired to complete repairs and will provide Purchaser written\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnotice of Seller's estimation (the 'Casualty Notice') as soon as\n\nreasonably possible . . . .\"             Section 6.2.1 defined \"Material\n\nDamage\"    as   \"damage   which,   in    Seller's   reasonable    estimation,\n\nexceeds $4,000,000 to repair,\" and provided that \"[i]n the event of\n\nany Material Damage to or destruction of the Property or any\n\nportion thereof prior to Closing, Purchaser may, at its option,\n\nterminate this Agreement\" and recover its deposit.              Section 6.2.2\n\nprovided that if \"the Property is not Materially Damaged, then\n\nPurchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement;\"\n\ninstead, Chardón could either repair the nonmaterial damage in a\n\nmanner reasonably satisfactory to Wells or credit Wells at closing\n\nfor the reasonable cost to complete the repairs.\n\n            Section 7.3 required Chardón to deliver certain documents\n\nto the escrow agent on or before the closing date, including\n\n\"tenant estoppel certificates\" by which AI Plaza tenants warranted\n\ncertain information about their leases.1              Under Section 7.3.7,\n\nChardón was required to deliver \"Tenant Estoppel Certificates for\n\nthe Leases\" executed by tenants such that the tenants who executed\n\nestoppel    certificates,    in    the   aggregate,   \"occupy    75%   of   the\n\nleasable space in the Improvements (the 'Required Estoppels').\"\n\nThe Agreement specified that \"[i]t shall be a further condition to\n\n\n     1\n       For example, the tenant estoppel certificates contained\ninformation about the date of the tenant's lease, the square\nfootage of the leased property, and the amount of the security\ndeposit, and provided assurances that the lease remained in force\nand had not been amended or modified except as indicated.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fPurchaser's obligation to close the transaction\" that \"the Required\n\nEstoppels, do not . . . reflect any material discrepancies of the\n\nterms of the Leases as compared with the terms of the Leases set\n\nforth in the copies of the Leases delivered by Seller . . . .\"\n\nHowever,   this   section    also   stated      that   Wells'     remedies   for\n\nChardón's failure to deliver the required estoppels were limited:\n\n\"If Seller is unable to deliver the Required Estoppels\" by the\n\nclosing date, \"then Purchaser's sole remedies and recourses shall\n\nbe limited to either (A) waiving the requirement for the tenant\n\nestoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding to Closing\n\nwithout reduction of the Purchase Price or (B) terminating this\n\nAgreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and recovering any\n\ndeposit.\n\nB. The Fuel Spill\n\n           Prior to closing, the transformer for AI Plaza's main\n\nelectrical service failed on February 10, 2008, and the building's\n\ntwo diesel-powered back-up generators began operating.                 Late on\n\nFebruary 11 or early on February 12, a large diesel fuel spill\n\noccurred. About 1,200 gallons of fuel spilled from the maintenance\n\nroom on the building's top floor into other parts of the building.\n\nAs   a   result   of   the   spill,    AI     Plaza    required    significant\n\nremediation, repair, cleaning and restoration, and its tenants were\n\nforced to vacate the building.              Chardón obtained the necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fclearances to reopen the building for occupancy on March 26, and\n\nthe majority of tenants returned by the end of May.\n\n              On February 15, Chardón notified Wells by letter that a\n\nfuel spill had occurred at AI Plaza and that Chardón's initial\n\nestimate of the cost to clean up the spill and repair the damage to\n\nrepair \"the Property\" was $650,000.2         Chardón stated that pursuant\n\nto Section 6.2.2 of the Agreement, which governed nonmaterial\n\ndamage, it elected to complete a portion of the clean-up and repair\n\nprior to closing and credit Wells for the remaining costs of\n\nrepair.       The following week, Wells responded with concern that\n\n\"this estimate may be unduly low, and indeed the Property may have\n\nbeen Materially Damaged, as that term is defined in Section 6.2.1,\"\n\nand requested further information and documentation supporting\n\nChardón's estimate.\n\n              On March 6, Chardón advised Wells that it believed\n\nremediation of the fuel spill was \"95%\" complete. Chardón provided\n\na   revised    estimate   of   $2,546,509   for   the   \"expected    costs    to\n\ncomplete the environmental cleanup, restoration, and subsequent\n\ncertification relative to the diesel oil spill,\" and an additional\n\n$100,000 for replacement of the transformer for the building's main\n\nelectric      service.    Wells   again     expressed   concern     about    the\n\nreasonableness of Chardón's repair estimate, noting that \"we are\n\n\n      2\n       Chardón's letter stated that \"[a]ll capitalized terms used\nherein that are not expressly defined herein shall have the meaning\nascribed to them in the Agreement.\"\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstill reviewing this latest estimate but believe that it too may\n\nfall short of fully estimating the substantial damages incurred at\n\nthe Property\" due to the fuel spill.\n\n          In the course of litigation, Chardón produced expert\n\nevidence that the actual total cost to repair the physical property\n\nwas $3,606,407. Chardón also incurred additional costs in order to\n\n\"maintain cordial relations with the tenants,\" but did not consider\n\nthese expenditures to be repair costs within the meaning of the\n\nAgreement.   These additional costs included $2,343,878 in rent and\n\nother abatements to AI Plaza tenants, $671,804 in other \"tenant\n\nbenefits,\" and $208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits.\"3\n\nC. Tenant Estoppel Certificates\n\n          Prior   to   the   fuel   spill,   Chardón   delivered   tenant\n\nestoppel certificates to Wells on February 6, 2008, pursuant to\n\nSection 7.3.7 of the Agreement.       Several days later, Chardón and\n\nWells representatives had a phone conversation in which Wells\n\nraised concerns about apparent discrepancies in several of the\n\nestoppel certificates provided, and Chardón attempted to assuage\n\n\n\n     3\n       The $671,804 in other \"tenant benefits\" included a $1,000\ncredit toward a hotel stay for each employee who facilitated a\ntenant's move to a temporary location, a $50-per-employee credit\ntoward a tenant employee event, a $250 dinner-package giveaway for\neach floor of the building, flowers and breakfast upon the tenants'\nreturn to the building, and the equivalent of 60 days' rent for\neach tenant toward tenant improvements at the building.         The\n$208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits\" included payments\nfor third party consulting services, infrared inspection, and\nindoor air quality analyses.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fWells' concerns.    On February 11, Wells sent an email to Chardón\n\nlisting \"a few issues arising under the estoppels delivered last\n\nweek\" and stated that \"[t]hese matters must be resolved to Wells'\n\nsatisfaction prior to closing.\"4\n\n          On March 3, after the fuel spill, Wells reiterated to\n\nChardón that the estoppel certificates delivered on February 6 did\n\nnot satisfy Section 7.3.7 of the Agreement and that issues related\n\nto the estoppels \"remain[ed] outstanding.\"    Wells further noted\n\nthat in the wake of the fuel spill, local media had reported that\n\nsome tenants might not return to AI Plaza, and therefore Wells\n\nrequested that Chardón provide new, satisfactory estoppel letters\n\nfrom all tenants.   In letters dated March 11 and March 12, Wells\n\nagain stated that the estoppel certificates provided on February 6\n\nwere not satisfactory and noted that new estoppels had not been\n\nprovided after the fuel spill as requested.       Chardón did not\n\nprovide Wells with new estoppel certificates prior to closing.   At\n\nthe same time, Wells did not notify Chardón that it wished to\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         Wells' email detailed concerns with the estoppel\ncertificates executed by six tenants.      For example, the email\nstated that \"Goldman Antonetti alleges overpayment in rent due to\na miscalculation in the SF arising from the time of the second\namendment.    This could obviously be a material issue for both\nparties\"; \"Charles Schwab alleges an outstanding demising allowance\nthat, if not yet paid, will need to be credited to purchaser at\nclosing.    If Seller has already paid this amount, please send\nappropriate evidence\"; and \"[t]he ETS estoppel shows 3,205 SF, but\nthe lease says 3,025. This appears to be a typo and needs to be\nfixed. A handwritten change initialed by the tenant will suffice.\"\n\n                                -8-\n\fterminate the Agreement due to Chardón's alleged failure to provide\n\nsatisfactory estoppel certificates.\n\nD. Closing\n\n            Following postponement of the original closing date, on\n\nMarch 10, Chardón notified Wells that the new closing date would be\n\nMarch 14.       On March 11, Wells objected to Chardón's attempt to\n\nproceed to closing at that time, stating that Chardón had \"failed\n\nto comply with its obligations and satisfy all of the conditions of\n\nClosing.\"      In particular, Wells cited Chardón's failure to provide\n\nsatisfactory estoppel certificates and its failure to provide a\n\nreasonable estimate of the damages to AI Plaza.          Chardón appeared\n\nfor closing on March 14, but Wells did not.          Both parties claimed\n\nthe $4 million deposit, and the escrow agent advised the parties\n\nthat it would hold the funds pending resolution of the dispute.\n\nE. Proceedings in the District Court\n\n            Wells filed this action in federal district court in June\n\n2008, alleging causes of action under Puerto Rico law5 for breach\n\nof contract and rescission or resolution of contract.            See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 2994, 3018, 3052.         Wells sought the return of\n\nits $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney fees, alleging\n\nthat (1) a reasonable estimate of the repairs to AI Plaza exceeded\n\n$4   million    and   therefore   constituted   \"Material   Damage\"   under\n\n\n\n      5\n      The Agreement stated that it was to be \"governed, construed,\napplied, and enforced\" by Puerto Rico law.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fSection 6.2.1 of the Agreement, (2) Chardón failed to deliver the\n\nestoppel   certificates   required   under   Section   7.3.7   prior   to\n\nclosing, and (3) Chardón failed to comply with its maintenance\n\nobligations under Section 6.1.3.       Chardón filed a counterclaim\n\nalleging that Wells breached the Agreement by acting in bad faith\n\nand failing to close the transaction on March 14 and likewise\n\nsought as damages the $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney\n\nfees.\n\n           Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment.   Wells moved for summary judgment on the grounds\n\nthat (1) a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\"\n\nincluded costs to repair both the physical property and the leases,\n\nand therefore the undisputed facts demonstrated that a reasonable\n\nestimate of repair costs would exceed $4 million; and (2) Chardón\n\nfailed to deliver the required tenant estoppel certificates free of\n\nmaterial discrepancies prior to closing.      The motion contained no\n\nconcession that the cost of physical repairs alone was less than $4\n\nmillion and stated that the exact cost of repairs remained a\n\ndisputed fact. Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment on\n\nthe grounds that (1) a reasonable estimate of repairs to the\n\n\"Property\" included only physical repairs and not expenditures such\n\nas rent abatements and tenant benefits; (2) Chardón provided the\n\nrequired estoppel certificates and, in any event, Wells waived that\n\nrequirement; and (3) Chardón fulfilled its maintenance obligations.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            The district court granted Chardón's motion and denied\n\nWells' motion.       The court then dismissed Wells' complaint and\n\nentered judgment for Chardón on its counter-claim in the amount of\n\n$4 million plus interest and attorney fees.               This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            On appeal, Wells contends that the district court erred\n\nin denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary\n\njudgment for Chardón.          Wells argues that the court (1) improperly\n\ngranted sua sponte summary judgment as to certain issues, (2)\n\nerroneously interpreted the Agreement to mean that a reasonable\n\nestimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" was limited to physical\n\nrepairs,    (3)   erred    in    concluding    that   Chardón   delivered   the\n\nrequired tenant estoppel certificates and that Wells had waived\n\nthat requirement in any event, and (4) disregarded genuine issues\n\nof   material     fact    in    concluding    that    Chardón   fulfilled   its\n\ncontractual maintenance obligations.            Wells further contends that\n\nthe court abused its discretion in denying Wells' motion to compel\n\nproduction of certain documents.              We address each contention in\n\nturn.\n\n            Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, the\n\ndiscovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmovant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"             Fed. R. Civ.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fP. 56(c). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde   novo,    drawing    all   reasonable   inferences   in   favor   of   the\n\nnonmoving party.        Velez v. Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc., 585\n\nF.3d 441, 446 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n             Cross-motions for summary judgment do not alter the\n\nsummary judgment standard, but instead simply \"require us to\n\ndetermine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on the facts that are not disputed.\"              Adria Int'l\n\nGroup, Inc., v. Ferré Development, Inc., 241 F.3d 103, 107 (1st\n\nCir. 2001). Although it is well-settled that the court must decide\n\neach motion for summary judgment on its own merits, this does not\n\nmean that \"each motion must be considered in a vacuum.            Where, as\n\nhere, cross-motions for summary judgment are filed simultaneously,\n\nor nearly so, the district court ordinarily should consider the two\n\nmotions at the same time,\" applying the same standards to each\n\nmotion.      P.R. American Ins. Co. v. Rivera-Vázquez, 603 F.3d 125,\n\n133 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nA.           Sua Sponte Summary Judgment as to Material Damage Claim\n\n             Wells contends that the district court erred in granting\n\nsua sponte summary judgment as to issues underlying its claim that\n\nAI Plaza incurred \"Material Damage\" as a result of the fuel spill,\n\nwithout first affording Wells adequate notice and an opportunity to\n\npresent evidence and argument in support of its position.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f               In appropriate circumstances, a district court may enter\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte.          Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,\n\n89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986)).        Given the potential unfairness of this\n\npractice, however, the district court may summarily decide a claim\n\non its own initiative only if two conditions are met:                    First,\n\ndiscovery must be \"sufficiently advanced that the parties have\n\nenjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.\" Id.\n\nat 29.    Second, the court must first \"give[] the targeted party\n\nappropriate notice and a chance [in accordance with the rules] to\n\npresent its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or\n\ndefense.\"        Id.   In this context, \"notice\" requires that the\n\nnonmovant was given \"reason to believe the court might reach the\n\nissue    and    received   a   fair   opportunity   to   put   its   best   foot\n\nforward.\"      Levya v. On the Beach, Inc., 171 F.3d 717, 720 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also\n\nStella v. Town of Tewksbury, 4 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he\n\nnotice requirement for sua sponte summary judgment demands at the\n\nvery least that the parties (1) be made aware of the court's\n\nintention to mull such an approach, and (2) be afforded the benefit\n\nof the minimum 10-day period mandated by Rule 56.\")\n\n               A court's sua sponte entry of summary judgment without\n\nappropriate notice is often grounds for reversal.                    See, e.g.,\n\nLevya, 171 F.3d at 721; Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at 29.              However, if the\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fappellant was not procedurally prejudiced by the lack of adequate\n\nnotice -- that is, if the appellant was not deprived of the\n\nopportunity \"to present evidence in support of its position as a\n\nresult of the unfair surprise\" -- then the failure to provide\n\nnotice is harmless error.

Action\n\nRefund, 515 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           We conclude that the district court erred by entering\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte as to Wells' entire Material Damage\n\nclaim without appropriate notice. Wells' complaint alleged that it\n\nwas entitled to recover its $4 million deposit under Section 6.2.1\n\nbecause AI Plaza had suffered \"Material Damage,\" that is, damage to\n\n\"the Property\" that, in Chardón's \"reasonable estimation, exceeds\n\n$4,000,000 to repair.\"        Wells moved for summary judgment on this\n\nclaim, contending that under the Agreement, a reasonable estimate\n\nof costs to repair the \"Property\" included repairs to both the\n\nphysical property and the leases (for example, rent abatement and\n\nother   tenant   benefits),    and   that   it    was   undisputed   based   on\n\nChardón's own expert evidence that those combined costs exceeded $4\n\nmillion.\n\n           Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment only as\n\nto the contract interpretation issue.            In its motion, captioned a\n\n\"motion for partial summary judgment,\" Chardón contended that based\n\non the clear language of the Agreement, \"the Court should find, as\n\na matter of law, that the term 'repair costs' should be limited to\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fphysical repairs of the Property and that said term does not\n\ninclude tenant benefits, rent abatements or diminution of value.\"\n\nAs the \"partial summary judgment\" caption suggests, Chardón's\n\nmotion did not fully dispose of Wells' Material Damage claim: even\n\nif Chardón prevailed on the contract interpretation issue, Wells\n\ncould still succeed on its claim based on proof that a reasonable\n\nestimate   of   the   costs   of    physical   repairs   alone     exceeded   $4\n\nmillion.   Chardón did not move for summary dismissal of Wells'\n\nentire Material Damage claim and did not contend it was undisputed\n\nthat a reasonable estimate of the cost of physical repairs alone\n\nfell below the $4 million threshold.\n\n           Nevertheless,      the   court    entered   summary     judgment   on\n\nWells'   entire   Material    Damage     claim   on    its   own   initiative,\n\nreasoning that \"[h]aving found that the cost of repair is limited\n\nto the repair of the physical structure, the Court also necessarily\n\nfinds that Defendant has provided Plaintiff with a reasonable\n\nestimate of said cost\" and that this reasonable estimate was less\n\nthan $4 million.      Prior to making its sua sponte ruling, the court\n\ngave Wells no notice that it would decide not only the contract\n\ninterpretation issue of whether a reasonable estimate of repair\n\ncosts was limited to physical repairs, but also the fact-intensive\n\nissue of whether a reasonable estimate of repairs to the physical\n\nproperty alone exceeded $4 million. The record does not reveal any\n\norder or other statement from the court indicating to the parties\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthat it might summarily decide the merits of Wells' entire Material\n\nDamage claim.    Wells' own motion for summary judgment, which also\n\naddressed the Material Damage claim, further confirms the lack of\n\nnotice.    Wells stated in its motion that \"[w]hile the exact amount\n\nto repair the damage to the Property remains a disputed fact in\n\nthis litigation, that dispute does not require a trial, because\n\nthere are several key dispositive undisputed facts upon which this\n\nCourt can enter summary judgment in Wells' favor.\"               (Emphasis\n\nadded.)6\n\n             Moreover, we cannot say that the court's failure to\n\nprovide adequate notice was harmless.        Wells contends that, if it\n\nhad been on notice that its entire repair costs claim was at risk\n\nof dismissal, it would have presented evidence that Chardón's\n\nestimates of repair costs unreasonably excluded some costs related\n\nto repair of the physical structure, such as the cost of certain\n\nenvironmental   testing   at   the    building.7   Wells   was   therefore\n\n\n     6\n       Contrary to Chardón's suggestion, Wells' statement was not\na concession that it was undisputed that a reasonable estimate of\nthe cost to repair the physical property was less than $4 million.\nInstead, Wells was arguing that the factual dispute over repair\ncosts did not require a trial because Wells was entitled to summary\njudgment based on undisputed evidence that (1) a reasonable\nestimate of repair costs included both physical and lease-related\nrepairs and (2) those combined costs exceeded $4 million.\n     7\n        Invoking the general rule that arguments not first raised\nin the district court are forfeited, Chardón faults Wells for not\ncontending in the district court that Chardón's estimates\nunreasonably excluded physical repairs and that a reasonable\nestimate of the cost even of physical repairs alone exceeded $4\nmillion. However, Chardón misses the point. Because Chardón did\n\n                                     -16-\n\fprocedurally prejudiced by the sua sponte adjudication of its\n\nclaim.8\n\nB.         Ruling that a Reasonable Estimate of Costs to Repair the\n           \"Property\" Was Limited to Physical Repairs\n\n           Wells   contends   that   the   district   court   erred   in\n\nconcluding that a reasonable estimate of the cost to repair the\n\nProperty under Section 6.2.1 \"unambiguously refers to physical\n\ndamage.\"   Under Puerto Rico's Civil Code,\n\n           If the terms of a contract are clear and leave\n           no doubt as to the intentions of the\n           contracting parties, the literal sense of its\n           stipulations shall be observed.\n\n           If the words should appear contrary to the\n           evident intention of the contracting parties,\n           the intention shall prevail.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3471. \"'[C]lear' terms are those that 'in\n\nthemselves are lucid enough to be understood in one sense alone,\n\n\nnot move for summary judgment on the ground that a reasonable\nestimate of physical repairs was less than $4 million, and because\nWells did not have notice that this issue would be decided by the\ncourt sua sponte, Wells had no obligation to raise a genuine issue\nof material fact as to this issue.        Wells likewise had no\nobligation to move for summary judgment on this issue. That is\nespecially so since Wells' position is that there was a dispute of\nmaterial fact as to the total cost of repairs.\n     8\n       Although Wells also contends that the court improperly\ngranted sua sponte summary judgment on its resolution of contract\nclaim, we need not reach this issue.     While the court treated\nWells' resolution of contract claim as if it rested only on the\nestoppel certificate issue, that claim also rested in part on\nWells' allegation that Chardon failed to meet its contractual\nmaintenance obligations. As discussed below, the court erred in\nconcluding as a matter of law that Chardon fulfilled its\nmaintenance obligations, and therefore summary judgment on the\nresolution of contract claim was improper.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fwithout leaving any room for doubt, controversies or difference of\n\ninterpretation.'\"    Home Ins.

If the terms of the contract are ambiguous, extrinsic\n\nevidence is admissible to prove the parties' intent, and summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only if the undisputed extrinsic evidence\n\nof intent \"supports only one of the conflicting interpretations.\"\n\nAdria, 241 F.3d at 111; see also Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v.\n\nSecretary of Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1985) (approving summary judgment notwithstanding textual\n\nambiguity if \"the evidence presented about the parties' intended\n\nmeaning [is] so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide\n\nthe contrary\" (citing 3 Corbin on Contracts § 554 (1960)).\n\n           In this case, the text of the Agreement is ambiguous.\n\nSection 6.2.1 provided that in the event of \"Material Damage to or\n\ndestruction   of   the   Property   or   any   portion   thereof   prior   to\n\nClosing,\" Wells could terminate the contract and recover its\n\ndeposit.   This section defined \"Material Damage\" as \"damage which,\n\nin Seller's reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair.\"\n\nWells contends that a reasonable estimate of the costs to repair\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fthe \"Property\" under this section must include not only repairs to\n\nthe physical property but also repairs to the tenant leases -- for\n\nexample,    rent     abatement    and    other    tenant    benefits.        Wells'\n\ninterpretation finds support in Section 2.1 of the Agreement, which\n\ndefined the term \"Property\" to include \"the Real Property, the\n\nImprovements, and all of Seller's right, title, and interest in the\n\nLeases, in the Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible\n\nPersonal Property, and in the Service Contracts.\"                 The Agreement\n\nfurther specified that all defined terms, which were indicated by\n\ninitial capital letters, \"shall have the meaning set forth herein.\"\n\nThus, for purposes of their contractual dealings, the parties took\n\ncare to specially define the term \"Property\" in a manner somewhat\n\ndifferent from its ordinary meaning.             See In re Blinds to go Share\n\nPurchase Litigation, 443 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Where the\n\nparties to a contract take pains to define a key term specially,\n\ntheir     dealings      under    the    contract     are    governed    by    that\n\ndefinition.\")\n\n            We further note that Wells and Chardón, sophisticated\n\nparties represented by counsel, agreed to distinct definitions of\n\nthe     terms   \"Real    Property\"      (the     land),    \"Improvements\"      (the\n\nstructures, fixtures, equipment and machinery), and \"Property\" (the\n\nreal property, improvements, and leases, among other interests).\n\nElsewhere in the Agreement, the parties used the terms \"Real\n\nProperty\" or \"Improvements\" rather than the more inclusive term\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f\"Property.\"   If the parties intended a reasonable estimate of the\n\ncost of repairs under Section 6.2.1 to include repairs to the\n\nphysical property only, they could easily have referred to damage\n\nto the \"Real Property and Improvements\" rather than damage to the\n\n\"Property.\"\n\n          Chardón counters that a reasonable estimate of the costs\n\nto repair the Property under this section included only repairs to\n\nthe physical property, that is, to the land and building.     This\n\ninterpretation, too, finds support in the text of the Agreement.\n\nSection 6.2.1 spoke of \"damage\" and \"repair\" to the Property, words\n\nthat, at least as commonly used, make little sense in the context\n\nof tenant leases.    In addition, Section 6.2.2, which discussed\n\nnonmaterial damage, provided that the reasonable cost to complete\n\nrepairs was to be determined by \"an architect or engineer,\" both of\n\nwhich are professionals with expertise in assessing the cost of\n\nrepairs to physical property, not repairs to tenant leases.\n\n          Given that the text of the Agreement reasonably supports\n\nmultiple, conflicting interpretations, the district court erred in\n\nconcluding a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\"\n\nunambiguously referred only to physical repairs.    On remand, the\n\nfactfinder should consider extrinsic evidence to determine the\n\nparties' intent as to the meaning of the Agreement on this issue.\n\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3472 (in evaluating the parties'\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fintent, \"attention must principally be paid to [the parties'] acts,\n\ncontemporaneous and subsequent to the contract\").9\n\nC.   Tenant Estoppel Certificates\n\n           Wells next contends that the court erred in concluding\n\nthat Chardón provided the required tenant estoppel certificates\n\nfree of material discrepancies and, alternatively, that Wells\n\nwaived that requirement. We need not reach the question of whether\n\nChardón   provided      adequate   estoppel       certificates   because      even\n\nassuming it did not, we conclude that Wells has no remedy for this\n\nfailure under the clear terms of the Agreement.\n\n           As    a   condition     of    Wells'    obligation    to   close    the\n\ntransaction, the Agreement required that Chardón provide Wells with\n\ntenant estoppel certificates, free of material discrepancies, from\n\ncertain   AI    Plaza   tenants.        However,   Section   7.3.7(c)    of    the\n\n\n\n     9\n       In its motion for summary judgment in the district court,\nChardón pointed to certain extrinsic evidence that it contended\n\"confirm[ed]\" its interpretation of the \"lucid\" contractual\nlanguage. However, Chardón has not argued, either in the district\ncourt or on appeal, that even if the contractual language were\nambiguous, Chardón would be entitled to summary judgment based on\nthe extrinsic evidence of intent. In any event, we cannot say that\nthe extrinsic evidence of intent cited by Chardón was \"so one-sided\nthat no reasonable person could decide the contrary.\" See Boston\nFive, 768 F.2d at 8. In its motion for summary judgment, Chardón\nprimarily pointed to correspondence between the parties in which\nWells disputed the reasonableness of Chardón's estimates of repair\ncosts and pointed out physical repairs that Chardón had failed to\naccount for. This evidence certainly indicates that Wells believed\nthat a reasonable estimate of repair costs under Section 6.2.1\nincluded physical repairs, but does not necessarily establish that\nWells intended a reasonable estimate of repair costs to be limited\nto physical repairs.\n\n                                        -21-\n\fAgreement expressly stated that \"[n]otwithstanding anything herein\n\nto the contrary . . . if Seller is unable to deliver the Required\n\nEstoppels\" by the closing date, \"then Purchaser's sole remedies and\n\nrecourses shall be limited to either (A) waiving the requirement\n\nfor the tenant estoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding\n\nto    Closing   without    reduction    of    the    Purchase   Price    or    (B)\n\nterminating this Agreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and\n\nrecovering its deposit.       (Emphasis added.)          Under the Agreement,\n\nnotices such as that required by subsection (B) had to be in\n\nwriting.\n\n            Wells strenuously argues that it did not waive the\n\nestoppel certificate requirement within the meaning of subsection\n\n(A)   because   in   the   weeks   prior     to    closing,   Wells   repeatedly\n\ninformed    Chardón    that   some     of    the    estoppels   provided      were\n\ninadequate under Section 7.3.7 and requested that new, compliant\n\nestoppels be delivered.       At the same time, Wells concedes that it\n\ndid not terminate the Agreement by written notice due to Chardón's\n\nalleged failure to provide the required estoppels free of material\n\ndiscrepancies, as permitted by subsection (B).\n\n            Faced with its failure to pursue either of the remedies\n\nset forth in Section 7.3.7, Wells contends that Section 7.3.7 \"is\n\nsilent about what happens if Wells does not elect either option\"\n\nand argues that in this circumstance it should be deemed to have\n\nterminated the Agreement.          But Section 7.3.7 is not silent about\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fWells' remedies in the event that it declines to select either\n\noption -- instead, this section unambiguously states that Wells'\n\n\"sole remedies and recourses\" are \"limited\" to the two enumerated\n\ncourses   of   action.   We   cannot,   as   Wells   urges,   ignore   the\n\nAgreement's references to \"sole\" and \"limited\" remedies and rewrite\n\nthe Agreement to provide a third avenue of relief.        Because Wells\n\nchose not to pursue either of the options provided by Section\n\n7.3.7(c), it has no remedy or recourse for Chardón's alleged\n\nfailure to provide the required estoppels.10\n\nD. Maintenance Obligations\n\n           Wells further contends that the court overlooked genuine\n\nissues of material fact in concluding that Chardón complied with\n\nits maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3 of the Agreement.\n\n           Section 6.1.3 imposed an ongoing obligation on Chardón,\n\nfrom the effective date of the Agreement (January 25) through\n\nclosing, to \"maintain . . . all Improvements substantially in their\n\n\n\n     10\n       Wells' argument that it should be deemed to have terminated\nthe Agreement relies in part on the language of Section 10.2, a\nmore general provision on the purchaser's remedies in the event\nthat the seller defaults on its obligations under the Agreement for\nreasons other than the purchaser's failure to perform. However,\neven assuming that these two sections are in conflict, Section\n7.3.7, which directly and specifically addresses the parties'\nremedies in the event that Chardón fails to deliver the required\nestoppels, cannot be set aside based on the general language of\nSection 10.2. See, e.g., Central Intern. Co. v. Kemper Nat. Ins.\nCos., 202 F.3d 372 (1st Cir. 2000) (setting forth the \"ordinary\nprinciple[] of contract interpretation\" that \"specific language is\ntreated as a limitation on general language\" (citing Restatement\n(Second) of Contracts § 203(c) (1979))).\n\n                                 -23-\n\fpresent condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted)\n\nand   in   a   manner   consistent    with    Seller's   maintenance   of    the\n\nImprovements during Seller's period of ownership.\"11\n\n               Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party, Wells, we conclude that there are genuine issues\n\nof    material      fact   as    to   whether     Chardón   maintained       all\n\n\"Improvements,\" in particular the building's back-up generators and\n\nassociated fuel tanks and fuel-pumping system, substantially in\n\ntheir present condition and in a manner consistent with Chardón's\n\nmaintenance during its ownership.            On February 10, the transformer\n\nfor AI Plaza's primary electrical service failed and the building's\n\ntwo back-up generators were activated. The back-up generators were\n\npowered by diesel fuel.         A fuel-pumping system transported diesel\n\nfuel from large storage tanks in the building's basement to two\n\nsmaller day tanks located on the top floor mechanical room.                 Late\n\non February 11 or early on the morning of February 12, a control\n\npanel on the day tanks malfunctioned.             As a result, the pumping\n\nsystem continued to pump fuel into the two day tanks even after\n\nthey were full, causing them to overflow.                Although the system\n\nsounded an alarm, it was only audible on one level of the building\n\nand was not heard for several hours.            By the time the problem was\n\n\n      11\n       The district court determined that \"the 'as is' language\ncontained in section 11.2 of the Agreement does not relieve\n[Chardón] of its specific maintenance obligations under Section\n6.1.3.\" Chardón does not challenge that conclusion on appeal and\ntherefore we do not address it.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fdiscovered, about 1,200 gallons of fuel had spilled from the\n\nmechanical room into utility shafts, electrical ducts, and other\n\nparts of the building.\n\n            In granting summary judgment for Chardón, the district\n\ncourt relied on largely undisputed evidence of Chardón's preventive\n\nmaintenance of the back-up generators.                 In June 2007, Chardón\n\nentered into an annual maintenance service contract with RIMCO,\n\nInc., for the maintenance of the generators, pursuant to which\n\nRIMCO     provided   \"Level    II\"12      preventive    maintenance    on   both\n\ngenerators twice annually.         The last regular Level II maintenance\n\nvisit before the fuel spill occurred in November 2007, and the next\n\nvisit was scheduled for May 2008.           On February 11, 2008, after the\n\nback-up generators were activated, RIMCO performed a \"Level I\"\n\npreventive    inspection      of   the    back-up    generators   at   Chardón's\n\nrequest and found them to be in good operating condition.               Shortly\n\nafter the fuel spill, on February 14, RIMCO returned for another\n\nmaintenance visit and found that a control panel on the day tanks\n\nwas \"frozen.\" The RIMCO technician reset the control panel, tested\n\nit, and found it operational.                   As a preventive measure, the\n\ntechnician then replaced the control panels at Chardón's request.\n\nThe generators were again found to be in good operating condition.\n\nBased on this evidence, the court concluded that there was no\n\n\n\n     12\n       RIMCO had two levels of maintenance service; Level II was\nthe more comprehensive service.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fgenuine issue of fact as to whether Chardón complied with its\n\nmaintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3.\n\n            However, additional evidence proffered by Wells, which\n\nwas not mentioned by the district court, raised a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial    fact   as   to   whether    Chardón    and/or    its    independent\n\ncontractor, RIMCO, negligently maintained the building's back-up\n\ngenerators and associated fuel-pumping system in the days before\n\nthe fuel spill.      First, Wells produced evidence that the systems\n\nlikely responsible for the spill, the fuel-pumping system and day\n\ntank    control    panels,   were   not   within    the     scope   of   RIMCO's\n\nresponsibility or expertise.        RIMCO representatives testified that\n\nChardón contracted with RIMCO to inspect and maintain only the\n\ngenerators themselves. RIMCO was not hired to perform, and did not\n\nhave the technical expertise to perform, service and maintenance of\n\nthe fuel-pumping system, the valves for the fuel-pumping system,\n\nthe day tank control panels, or the alarm system.              On February 11,\n\nthe day before the fuel spill, the RIMCO technician did not inspect\n\nthe day tank control panels or fuel-pumping system.13               There is no\n\nevidence that anyone other than RIMCO was hired to inspect and\n\nmaintain these associated systems.\n\n\n\n       13\n        Chardón disputes this view of the scope of RIMCO's\nmaintenance responsibilities, pointing to evidence that the RIMCO\nLevel II inspection checklist included \"[c]hecking the function of\nall clocks and safety indicators\" and that RIMCO did in fact\ninspect the generator gauges and security indicators. However, any\nfactual dispute on this point is for the factfinder to decide.\n\n                                       -26-\n\f           Second, Wells produced evidence that Chardón's preventive\n\nmaintenance of the generators between semiannual RIMCO inspections\n\nwas not in accordance with the guidelines in the manufacturer's\n\nmanual.   For example, although the manufacturer recommended weekly\n\noperational checks of the generators, Chardón's logbooks indicated\n\nthat it ordinarily performed only monthly operational checks.\n\n           Third, Wells produced evidence that in February 2009,\n\nChardón   and   its   insurer   filed    suit   against   RIMCO   and   other\n\nindependent contractors alleging negligence in the installation and\n\nmaintenance of the electrical transformer, back-up generators, and\n\nassociated systems.     The suit claimed, inter alia, that RIMCO was\n\nnegligent in \"not installing or appropriately maintaining, testing,\n\ninspecting, and/or repairing the diesel-driven backup generator\n\nsystems, including the day tanks, in such a way as to ensure that\n\nthe appropriate precautions were taken to avoid an overflow of\n\ndiesel fuel from the day tanks.\"        Chardón does not dispute that its\n\ncontractor's negligence may be imputed to it for purposes of this\n\ncontractual obligation.     Such imputation would be consistent with\n\ncertain tort law principles.      See Colmenares Vivas v. Sun Alliance\n\nIns. Co., 807 F.2d 1102, 1107 (1st Cir. 1986) (stating \"general\n\nprinciple\" that the duty to keep business premises reasonably safe\n\ncannot be delegated to a third party (citing Restatement (Second)\n\nof Torts § 344 (1965))); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §\n\n425 (property owner who \"employs an independent contractor to\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fmaintain in safe condition land which he holds open to the entry of\n\nthe public as his place of business\" is liable for contractor's\n\nnegligence).\n\n             Viewed in the light most favorable to Wells, the evidence\n\npermits a finding that Chardón did not fulfill its maintenance\n\nobligations under Section 6.1.3. A reasonable jury could find that\n\nChardón and/or RIMCO negligently maintained the back-up generators,\n\nday tanks, and fuel-pumping system in the days leading up to the\n\nfuel    spill,   and    that   Chardón    thereby   failed    in   its   ongoing\n\nobligation to maintain these \"Improvements\" substantially in their\n\npresent     condition    and   in   a   manner   consistent   with   Chardón's\n\nmaintenance during its ownership of the property.14\n\nE. Motion to Compel\n\n             Finally, Wells contends that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying its motion to compel production of\n\n\n\n\n       14\n        Chardón argues that \"[w]hether or not RIMCO actually\nperformed 'good' or 'bad' maintenance, or whether it maintained\nsystems other than the generators, is totally irrelevant.\"      In\nChardón's view, it fulfilled its maintenance obligations under\nSection 6.1.3 simply because it \"maintained the same level of\nmaintenance\" from the effective date of the Agreement through the\npurported closing date, that is, a Level II maintenance service\ncontract with RIMCO. However, the requirements of Section 6.1.3\ncannot be so easily avoided.      If Chardón or its independent\ncontractors negligently failed to maintain the back-up generators,\nday tanks, or fuel-pumping system in the weeks between the\neffective date of the contract and the closing date, a jury could\nreasonably find that Chardón failed to \"maintain . . . all\nImprovements substantially in their present condition\" within the\nmeaning of Section 6.1.3.\n\n                                        -28-\n\fdocuments related to Chardón's claim against its insurer for\n\ndamages resulting from the fuel spill.\n\n           The trial court has \"broad discretion in ruling on pre-\n\ntrial management matters,\" and we review the court's denial of\n\nWells' motion to compel \"for abuse of its considerable discretion.\"\n\nAyala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n1996). This standard of review is \"not appellant-friendly,\" and we\n\n\"will intervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of\n\nmanifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery\n\norder was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to\n\nthe aggrieved party.\"      Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 549 F.3d\n\n851, 860 (1st Cir. 2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n           The district court denied Wells' motion to compel on the\n\nground   that   its   discovery   request   was   \"untimely   and   unduly\n\nburdensome,\" a determination well-supported by the record.             On\n\nApril 2, 2009, Wells for the first time demanded all documents\n\nrelated to Chardón's insurance claim for damages arising from the\n\nfuel spill, including \"any documents submitted to your client's\n\ninsurer and any correspondence among [the insurer] and [Chardón].\"\n\nThis broad request came months after the October 14, 2008 initial\n\nscheduling conference, the date by which the court had ordered the\n\nparties to serve all interrogatories and requests for production.\n\nWells' original request for production of documents, which was\n\nfiled in September 2008, within the discovery deadlines, did not\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\frequest any documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.15   In\n\nlight of this evidence, the court acted within its considerable\n\ndiscretion in denying Wells' motion to compel.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and the case is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n       Wells contends that documents related to Chardón's insurance\nclaim should have been produced in response to its original\nrequests for production, which contained a request for \"[a]ll\ndocuments concerning or relating to the Fuel Spill, and the\nsubsequent clean-up and repairs associated therewith.\" However,\nthis general language cannot be reasonably understood as a request\nfor documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

(Wells) entered into an agreement with defendant Chardón/Hato Rey Partnership, S.E. (Chardón) for the purchase of a commercial building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Prior to the expected closing date, a large fuel spill occurred at the property, causing significant damage and displacing the building's tenants. Chardón insisted on proceeding to closing over Wells' objections. After Wells failed to appear for the scheduled closing, both parties filed claims for breach of contract.</p>\n<p>Wells appeals from the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Chardón on Wells' claims for breach and resolution of contract and Chardón's counter-claim for breach of contract. After careful review, we affirm the judgment in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Purchase and Sale Agreement</h2>\n<p>On January 25, 2008, Wells entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement) with Chardón by which Wells agreed to purchase the American International Plaza building in San Juan (AI Plaza) for $80 million. Pursuant to the Agreement, Wells placed a $4 million deposit in escrow and agreed to pay the $76 million balance at closing.</p>\n<p>Section 2.1 of the Agreement defined the \"Property\" that Wells agreed to purchase from Chardón:</p>\n<blockquote>2.1 <i>Property.</i> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, the Real Property, the Improvements, and all of Seller's right, title, and interest in the Leases, in the Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible Personal Property, and in the Service Contracts (as such terms are defined below) (all of which are collectively referred to as the <i>\"Property\"</i>).</blockquote>\n<p>Article 6 of the Agreement addressed \"OPERATIONS AND RISK OF LOSS.\" Section 6.1.3 set forth Chardón's ongoing maintenance obligations from the effective date of the Agreement, January 25, through closing:</p>\n<blockquote>6.1.3. <i>Maintenance of Improvements; Removal of Personal Property.</i> Subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3, Seller shall maintain or cause the tenants under the Leases to maintain (to the extent provided in such Leases) all Improvements substantially in their present condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted) and in a manner consistent with Seller's maintenance of the Improvements during Seller's period of ownership. Seller will not remove any Tangible Personal Property except as may be required for necessary repair or replacement.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 6.2, entitled \"Damage,\" set forth the parties' rights and obligations in the event that \"prior to Closing the Property is damaged by fire or other casualty.\" If such a casualty occurred, \"Seller shall estimate the cost to repair and the time required to complete repairs and will provide Purchaser written notice of Seller's estimation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> (the <i>`Casualty Notice'</i>) as soon as reasonably possible....\" Section 6.2.1 defined \"Material Damage\" as \"damage which, in Seller's reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair,\" and provided that \"[i]n the event of any Material Damage to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof prior to Closing, Purchaser may, at its option, terminate this Agreement\" and recover its deposit. Section 6.2.2 provided that if \"the Property is not Materially Damaged, then Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement;\" instead, Chardón could either repair the nonmaterial damage in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Wells or credit Wells at closing for the reasonable cost to complete the repairs.</p>\n<p>Section 7.3 required Chardón to deliver certain documents to the escrow agent on or before the closing date, including \"tenant estoppel certificates\" by which AI Plaza tenants warranted certain information about their leases.<sup>[1]</sup> Under Section 7.3.7, Chardón was required to deliver \"Tenant Estoppel Certificates for the Leases\" executed by tenants such that the tenants who executed estoppel certificates, in the aggregate, \"occupy 75% of the leasable space in the Improvements (the <i>`Required Estoppels'</i>).\" The Agreement specified that \"[i]t shall be a further condition to Purchaser's obligation to close the transaction\" that \"the Required Estoppels, do not ... reflect any material discrepancies of the terms of the Leases as compared with the terms of the Leases set forth in the copies of the Leases delivered by Seller....\" However, this section also stated that Wells' remedies for Chardón's failure to deliver the required estoppels were limited: \"If Seller is unable to deliver the Required Estoppels\" by the closing date, \"then Purchaser's sole remedies and recourses shall be limited to either (A) waiving the requirement for the tenant estoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding to Closing without reduction of the Purchase Price or (B) terminating this Agreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and recovering any deposit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Fuel Spill</h2>\n<p>Prior to closing, the transformer for AI Plaza's main electrical service failed on February 10, 2008, and the building's two diesel-powered back-up generators began operating. Late on February 11 or early on February 12, a large diesel fuel spill occurred. About 1,200 gallons of fuel spilled from the maintenance room on the building's top floor into other parts of the building. As a result of the spill, AI Plaza required significant remediation, repair, cleaning and restoration, and its tenants were forced to vacate the building. Chardón obtained the necessary clearances to reopen the building for occupancy on March 26, and the majority of tenants returned by the end of May.</p>\n<p>On February 15, Chardón notified Wells by letter that a fuel spill had occurred at AI Plaza and that Chardón's initial estimate of the cost to clean up the spill and repair the damage to repair \"the Property\" was $650,000.<sup>[2]</sup> Chardón stated that pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the Agreement, which governed nonmaterial damage, it elected to complete a portion of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> clean-up and repair prior to closing and credit Wells for the remaining costs of repair. The following week, Wells responded with concern that \"this estimate may be unduly low, and indeed the Property may have been Materially Damaged, as that term is defined in Section 6.2.1,\" and requested further information and documentation supporting Chardón's estimate.</p>\n<p>On March 6, Chardón advised Wells that it believed remediation of the fuel spill was \"95%\" complete. Chardón provided a revised estimate of $2,546,509 for the \"expected costs to complete the environmental cleanup, restoration, and subsequent certification relative to the diesel oil spill,\" and an additional $100,000 for replacement of the transformer for the building's main electric service. Wells again expressed concern about the reasonableness of Chardón's repair estimate, noting that \"we are still reviewing this latest estimate but believe that it too may fall short of fully estimating the substantial damages incurred at the Property\" due to the fuel spill.</p>\n<p>In the course of litigation, Chardón produced expert evidence that the actual total cost to repair the physical property was $3,606,407. Chardón also incurred additional costs in order to \"maintain cordial relations with the tenants,\" but did not consider these expenditures to be repair costs within the meaning of the Agreement. These additional costs included $2,343,878 in rent and other abatements to AI Plaza tenants, $671,804 in other \"tenant benefits,\" and $208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Tenant Estoppel Certificates</h2>\n<p>Prior to the fuel spill, Chardón delivered tenant estoppel certificates to Wells on February 6, 2008, pursuant to Section 7.3.7 of the Agreement. Several days later, Chardón and Wells representatives had a phone conversation in which Wells raised concerns about apparent discrepancies in several of the estoppel certificates provided, and Chardón attempted to assuage Wells' concerns. On February 11, Wells sent an email to Chardón listing \"a few issues arising under the estoppels delivered last week\" and stated that \"[t]hese matters must be resolved to Wells' satisfaction prior to closing.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On March 3, after the fuel spill, Wells reiterated to Chardón that the estoppel certificates delivered on February 6 did not satisfy Section 7.3.7 of the Agreement and that issues related to the estoppels \"remain[ed] outstanding.\" Wells further noted that in the wake of the fuel spill, local media had reported that some tenants might not return to AI Plaza, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> therefore Wells requested that Chardón provide new, satisfactory estoppel letters from all tenants. In letters dated March 11 and March 12, Wells again stated that the estoppel certificates provided on February 6 were not satisfactory and noted that new estoppels had not been provided after the fuel spill as requested. Chardón did not provide Wells with new estoppel certificates prior to closing. At the same time, Wells did not notify Chardón that it wished to terminate the Agreement due to Chardón's alleged failure to provide satisfactory estoppel certificates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Closing</h2>\n<p>Following postponement of the original closing date, on March 10, Chardón notified Wells that the new closing date would be March 14. On March 11, Wells objected to Chardón's attempt to proceed to closing at that time, stating that Chardón had \"failed to comply with its obligations and satisfy all of the conditions of Closing.\" In particular, Wells cited Chardón's failure to provide satisfactory estoppel certificates and its failure to provide a reasonable estimate of the damages to AI Plaza. Chardón appeared for closing on March 14, but Wells did not. Both parties claimed the $4 million deposit, and the escrow agent advised the parties that it would hold the funds pending resolution of the dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Proceedings in the District Court</h2>\n<p>Wells filed this action in federal district court in June 2008, alleging causes of action under Puerto Rico law<sup>[5]</sup> for breach of contract and rescission or resolution of contract. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 2994, 3018, 3052. Wells sought the return of its $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney fees, alleging that (1) a reasonable estimate of the repairs to AI Plaza exceeded $4 million and therefore constituted \"Material Damage\" under Section 6.2.1 of the Agreement, (2) Chardón failed to deliver the estoppel certificates required under Section 7.3.7 prior to closing, and (3) Chardón failed to comply with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3. Chardón filed a counterclaim alleging that Wells breached the Agreement by acting in bad faith and failing to close the transaction on March 14 and likewise sought as damages the $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney fees.</p>\n<p>Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Wells moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" included costs to repair both the physical property and the leases, and therefore the undisputed facts demonstrated that a reasonable estimate of repair costs would exceed $4 million; and (2) Chardón failed to deliver the required tenant estoppel certificates free of material discrepancies prior to closing. The motion contained no concession that the cost of physical repairs alone was less than $4 million and stated that the exact cost of repairs remained a disputed fact. Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the grounds that (1) a reasonable estimate of repairs to the \"Property\" included only physical repairs and not expenditures such as rent abatements and tenant benefits; (2) Chardón provided the required estoppel certificates and, in any event, Wells waived that requirement; and (3) Chardón fulfilled its maintenance obligations.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Chardón's motion and denied Wells' motion. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> court then dismissed Wells' complaint and entered judgment for Chardón on its counter-claim in the amount of $4 million plus interest and attorney fees. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Wells contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment for Chardón. Wells argues that the court (1) improperly granted sua sponte summary judgment as to certain issues, (2) erroneously interpreted the Agreement to mean that a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" was limited to physical repairs, (3) erred in concluding that Chardón delivered the required tenant estoppel certificates and that Wells had waived that requirement in any event, and (4) disregarded genuine issues of material fact in concluding that Chardón fulfilled its contractual maintenance obligations. Wells further contends that the court abused its discretion in denying Wells' motion to compel production of certain documents. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p>Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Velez v. Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 585 F.3d 441, 446 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Cross-motions for summary judgment do not alter the summary judgment standard, but instead simply \"require us to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on the facts that are not disputed.\" <i>Adria Int'l Group, Inc., v. Ferré Development, Inc.,</i> 241 F.3d 103, 107 (1st Cir.2001). Although it is well-settled that the court must decide each motion for summary judgment on its own merits, this does not mean that \"each motion must be considered in a vacuum. Where, as here, cross-motions for summary judgment are filed simultaneously, or nearly so, the district court ordinarily should consider the two motions at the same time,\" applying the same standards to each motion. <i>P.R. American Ins. Co. v. Rivera-Vázquez,</i> 603 F.3d 125, 133 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sua Sponte Summary Judgment as to Material Damage Claim</h2>\n<p>Wells contends that the district court erred in granting sua sponte summary judgment as to issues underlying its claim that AI Plaza incurred \"Material Damage\" as a result of the fuel spill, without first affording Wells adequate notice and an opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of its position.</p>\n<p>In appropriate circumstances, a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte. <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (citing <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). Given the potential unfairness of this practice, however, the district court may summarily decide a claim on its own initiative only if two conditions are met: First, discovery must be \"sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 29. Second, the court must first \"give[ ] the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance [in accordance with the rules] to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\" <i>Id.</i> In this context, \"notice\" requires that the nonmovant was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> given \"reason to believe the court might reach the issue and received a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.\" <i>Leyva v. On the Beach, Inc.,</i> 171 F.3d 717, 720 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Stella v. Town of Tewksbury,</i> 4 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[T]he notice requirement for sua sponte summary judgment demands at the very least that the parties (1) be made aware of the court's intention to mull such an approach, and (2) be afforded the benefit of the minimum 10-day period mandated by Rule 56.\")</p>\n<p>A court's sua sponte entry of summary judgment without appropriate notice is often grounds for reversal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Leyva,</i> 171 F.3d at 721; <i>Berkovitz,</i> 89 F.3d at 29. However, if the appellant was not procedurally prejudiced by the lack of adequate noticethat is, if the appellant was not deprived of the opportunity \"to present evidence in support of its position as a result of the unfair surprise\"then the failure to provide notice is harmless error. <i>P.R. Electric Power Auth. v. Action Refund,</i> 515 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court erred by entering summary judgment sua sponte as to Wells' entire Material Damage claim without appropriate notice. Wells' complaint alleged that it was entitled to recover its $4 million deposit under Section 6.2.1 because AI Plaza had suffered \"Material Damage,\" that is, damage to \"the Property\" that, in Chardón's \"reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair.\" Wells moved for summary judgment on this claim, contending that under the Agreement, a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" included repairs to both the physical property and the leases (for example, rent abatement and other tenant benefits), and that it was undisputed based on Chardón's own expert evidence that those combined costs exceeded $4 million.</p>\n<p>Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment only as to the contract interpretation issue. In its motion, captioned a \"motion for partial summary judgment,\" Chardón contended that based on the clear language of the Agreement, \"the Court should find, as a matter of law, that the term `repair costs' should be limited to physical repairs of the Property and that said term does not include tenant benefits, rent abatements or diminution of value.\" As the \"partial summary judgment\" caption suggests, Chardón's motion did not fully dispose of Wells' Material Damage claim: even if Chardón prevailed on the contract interpretation issue, Wells could still succeed on its claim based on proof that a reasonable estimate of the costs of <i>physical repairs alone</i> exceeded $4 million. Chardón did not move for summary dismissal of Wells' entire Material Damage claim and did not contend it was undisputed that a reasonable estimate of the cost of physical repairs alone fell below the $4 million threshold.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the court entered summary judgment on Wells' entire Material Damage claim on its own initiative, reasoning that \"[h]aving found that the cost of repair is limited to the repair of the physical structure, the Court also necessarily finds that Defendant has provided Plaintiff with a reasonable estimate of said cost\" and that this reasonable estimate was less than $4 million. Prior to making its sua sponte ruling, the court gave Wells no notice that it would decide not only the contract interpretation issue of whether a reasonable estimate of repair costs was limited to physical repairs, but also the fact-intensive issue of whether a reasonable estimate of repairs to the physical property alone exceeded $4 million. The record does not reveal any order or other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> statement from the court indicating to the parties that it might summarily decide the merits of Wells' entire Material Damage claim. Wells' own motion for summary judgment, which also addressed the Material Damage claim, further confirms the lack of notice. Wells stated in its motion that \"<i>[w]hile the exact amount to repair the damage to the Property remains a disputed fact in this litigation,</i> that dispute does not require a trial, because there are several key dispositive undisputed facts upon which this Court can enter summary judgment in Wells' favor.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, we cannot say that the court's failure to provide adequate notice was harmless. Wells contends that, if it had been on notice that its entire repair costs claim was at risk of dismissal, it would have presented evidence that Chardón's estimates of repair costs unreasonably excluded some costs related to repair of the physical structure, such as the cost of certain environmental testing at the building.<sup>[7]</sup> Wells was therefore procedurally prejudiced by the sua sponte adjudication of its claim.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Ruling that a Reasonable Estimate of Costs to Repair the \"Property\" Was Limited to Physical Repairs</h2>\n<p>Wells contends that the district court erred in concluding that a reasonable estimate of the cost to repair the Property under Section 6.2.1 \"unambiguously refers to physical damage.\" Under Puerto Rico's Civil Code,</p>\n<blockquote>If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3471. \"`[C]lear' terms are those that `in themselves are lucid enough to be understood in one sense alone, without leaving any room for doubt, controversies or difference of interpretation.'\" <i>Home Ins. Co. v. Pan American Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> 397 F.3d 12, 16 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Heirs of Ramírez v. Superior Court,</i> 81 P.R.R. 347, 351, 1959 WL 13587 (1959)). The terms of a contract \"should be interpreted in relation to one another, giving to those that are doubtful the meaning which may appear from the consideration of all of them together.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3475. If the terms of the contract are ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the parties' intent, and summary judgment is appropriate only if the undisputed extrinsic evidence of intent \"supports only one of the conflicting interpretations.\" <i>Adria,</i> 241 F.3d at 111; <i>see also </i><i>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Secretary of Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev.,</i> 768 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1985) (approving summary judgment notwithstanding textual ambiguity if \"the evidence presented about the parties' intended meaning [is] so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide the contrary\") (citing 3 <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> § 554 (1960)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the text of the Agreement is ambiguous. Section 6.2.1 provided that in the event of \"Material Damage to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof prior to Closing,\" Wells could terminate the contract and recover its deposit. This section defined \"Material Damage\" as \"damage which, in Seller's reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair.\" Wells contends that a reasonable estimate of the costs to repair the \"Property\" under this section must include not only repairs to the physical property but also repairs to the tenant leasesfor example, rent abatement and other tenant benefits. Wells' interpretation finds support in Section 2.1 of the Agreement, which defined the term <i>\"Property\"</i> to include \"the Real Property, the Improvements, and all of Seller's right, title, and interest in the Leases, in the Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible Personal Property, and in the Service Contracts.\" The Agreement further specified that all defined terms, which were indicated by initial capital letters, \"shall have the meaning set forth herein.\" Thus, for purposes of their contractual dealings, the parties took care to specially define the term \"Property\" in a manner somewhat different from its ordinary meaning. <i>See </i><i>In re Blinds to go Share Purchase Litigation,</i> 443 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Where the parties to a contract take pains to define a key term specially, their dealings under the contract are governed by that definition.\")</p>\n<p>We further note that Wells and Chardón, sophisticated parties represented by counsel, agreed to distinct definitions of the terms \"Real Property\" (the land), \"Improvements\" (the structures, fixtures, equipment and machinery), and \"Property\" (the real property, improvements, and leases, among other interests). Elsewhere in the Agreement, the parties used the terms \"Real Property\" or \"Improvements\" rather than the more inclusive term \"Property.\" If the parties intended a reasonable estimate of the cost of repairs under Section 6.2.1 to include repairs to the physical property only, they could easily have referred to damage to the \"Real Property and Improvements\" rather than damage to the \"Property.\"</p>\n<p>Chardón counters that a reasonable estimate of the costs to repair the Property under this section included only repairs to the physical property, that is, to the land and building. This interpretation, too, finds support in the text of the Agreement. Section 6.2.1 spoke of \"damage\" and \"repair\" to the Property, words that, at least as commonly used, make little sense in the context of tenant leases. In addition, Section 6.2.2, which discussed nonmaterial damage, provided that the reasonable cost to complete repairs was to be determined by \"an architect or engineer,\" both of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> which are professionals with expertise in assessing the cost of repairs to physical property, not repairs to tenant leases.</p>\n<p>Given that the text of the Agreement reasonably supports multiple, conflicting interpretations, the district court erred in concluding a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" unambiguously referred only to physical repairs. On remand, the factfinder should consider extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent as to the meaning of the Agreement on this issue. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3472 (in evaluating the parties' intent, \"attention must principally be paid to [the parties'] acts, contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Tenant Estoppel Certificates</h2>\n<p>Wells next contends that the court erred in concluding that Chardón provided the required tenant estoppel certificates free of material discrepancies and, alternatively, that Wells waived that requirement. We need not reach the question of whether Chardón provided adequate estoppel certificates because even assuming it did not, we conclude that Wells has no remedy for this failure under the clear terms of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>As a condition of Wells' obligation to close the transaction, the Agreement required that Chardón provide Wells with tenant estoppel certificates, free of material discrepancies, from certain AI Plaza tenants. However, Section 7.3.7(c) of the Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]otwithstanding anything herein to the contrary... if Seller is unable to deliver the Required Estoppels\" by the closing date, \"then Purchaser's <i>sole remedies and recourses shall be limited to either</i> (A) waiving the requirement for the tenant estoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding to Closing without reduction of the Purchase Price or (B) terminating this Agreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and recovering its deposit. (Emphasis added.) Under the Agreement, notices such as that required by subsection (B) had to be in writing.</p>\n<p>Wells strenuously argues that it did not waive the estoppel certificate requirement within the meaning of subsection (A) because in the weeks prior to closing, Wells repeatedly informed Chardón that some of the estoppels provided were inadequate under Section 7.3.7 and requested that new, compliant estoppels be delivered. At the same time, Wells concedes that it did not terminate the Agreement by written notice due to Chardón's alleged failure to provide the required estoppels free of material discrepancies, as permitted by subsection (B).</p>\n<p>Faced with its failure to pursue either of the remedies set forth in Section 7.3.7, Wells contends that Section 7.3.7 \"is silent about what happens if Wells does not elect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> either option\" and argues that in this circumstance it should be deemed to have terminated the Agreement. But Section 7.3.7 is not silent about Wells' remedies in the event that it declines to select either optioninstead, this section unambiguously states that Wells' \"sole remedies and recourses\" are \"limited\" to the two enumerated courses of action. We cannot, as Wells urges, ignore the Agreement's references to \"sole\" and \"limited\" remedies and rewrite the Agreement to provide a third avenue of relief. Because Wells chose not to pursue either of the options provided by Section 7.3.7(c), it has no remedy or recourse for Chardón's alleged failure to provide the required estoppels.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Maintenance Obligations</h2>\n<p>Wells further contends that the court overlooked genuine issues of material fact in concluding that Chardón complied with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>Section 6.1.3 imposed an ongoing obligation on Chardón, from the effective date of the Agreement (January 25) through closing, to \"maintain ... all Improvements substantially in their present condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted) and in a manner consistent with Seller's maintenance of the Improvements during Seller's period of ownership.\"<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Wells, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Chardón maintained all \"Improvements,\" in particular the building's back-up generators and associated fuel tanks and fuel-pumping system, substantially in their present condition and in a manner consistent with Chardón's maintenance during its ownership. On February 10, the transformer for AI Plaza's primary electrical service failed and the building's two back-up generators were activated. The back-up generators were powered by diesel fuel. A fuel-pumping system transported diesel fuel from large storage tanks in the building's basement to two smaller day tanks located on the top floor mechanical room. Late on February 11 or early on the morning of February 12, a control panel on the day tanks malfunctioned. As a result, the pumping system continued to pump fuel into the two day tanks even after they were full, causing them to overflow. Although the system sounded an alarm, it was only audible on one level of the building and was not heard for several hours. By the time the problem was discovered, about 1,200 gallons of fuel had spilled from the mechanical room into utility shafts, electrical ducts, and other parts of the building.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> In granting summary judgment for Chardón, the district court relied on largely undisputed evidence of Chardón's preventive maintenance of the back-up generators. In June 2007, Chardón entered into an annual maintenance service contract with RIMCO, Inc., for the maintenance of the generators, pursuant to which RIMCO provided \"Level II\"<sup>[12]</sup> preventive maintenance on both generators twice annually. The last regular Level II maintenance visit before the fuel spill occurred in November 2007, and the next visit was scheduled for May 2008. On February 11, 2008, after the back-up generators were activated, RIMCO performed a \"Level I\" preventive inspection of the back-up generators at Chardón's request and found them to be in good operating condition. Shortly after the fuel spill, on February 14, RIMCO returned for another maintenance visit and found that a control panel on the day tanks was \"frozen.\" The RIMCO technician reset the control panel, tested it, and found it operational. As a preventive measure, the technician then replaced the control panels at Chardón's request. The generators were again found to be in good operating condition. Based on this evidence, the court concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether Chardón complied with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3.</p>\n<p>However, additional evidence proffered by Wells, which was not mentioned by the district court, raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Chardón and/or its independent contractor, RIMCO, negligently maintained the building's back-up generators and associated fuel-pumping system in the days before the fuel spill. First, Wells produced evidence that the systems likely responsible for the spill, the fuel-pumping system and day tank control panels, were not within the scope of RIMCO's responsibility or expertise. RIMCO representatives testified that Chardón contracted with RIMCO to inspect and maintain only the generators themselves. RIMCO was not hired to perform, and did not have the technical expertise to perform, service and maintenance of the fuel-pumping system, the valves for the fuel-pumping system, the day tank control panels, or the alarm system. On February 11, the day before the fuel spill, the RIMCO technician did not inspect the day tank control panels or fuel-pumping system.<sup>[13]</sup> There is no evidence that anyone other than RIMCO was hired to inspect and maintain these associated systems.</p>\n<p>Second, Wells produced evidence that Chardón's preventive maintenance of the generators between semiannual RIMCO inspections was not in accordance with the guidelines in the manufacturer's manual. For example, although the manufacturer recommended weekly operational checks of the generators, Chardón's logbooks indicated that it ordinarily performed only monthly operational checks.</p>\n<p>Third, Wells produced evidence that in February 2009, Chardón and its insurer filed suit against RIMCO and other independent contractors alleging negligence in the installation and maintenance of the electrical transformer, back-up generators, and associated systems. The suit claimed, inter alia, that RIMCO was negligent in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> \"not installing or appropriately maintaining, testing, inspecting, and/or repairing the diesel-driven backup generator systems, including the day tanks, in such a way as to ensure that the appropriate precautions were taken to avoid an overflow of diesel fuel from the day tanks.\" Chardón does not dispute that its contractor's negligence may be imputed to it for purposes of this contractual obligation. Such imputation would be consistent with certain tort law principles. <i>See </i><i>Colmenares Vivas v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co.,</i> 807 F.2d 1102, 1107 (1st Cir.1986) (stating \"general principle\" that the duty to keep business premises reasonably safe cannot be delegated to a third party (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 344 (1965))); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 425 (property owner who \"employs an independent contractor to maintain in safe condition land which he holds open to the entry of the public as his place of business\" is liable for contractor's negligence).</p>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to Wells, the evidence permits a finding that Chardón did not fulfill its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3. A reasonable jury could find that Chardón and/or RIMCO negligently maintained the back-up generators, day tanks, and fuel-pumping system in the days leading up to the fuel spill, and that Chardón thereby failed in its ongoing obligation to maintain these \"Improvements\" substantially in their present condition and in a manner consistent with Chardón's maintenance during its ownership of the property.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Motion to Compel</h2>\n<p>Finally, Wells contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion to compel production of documents related to Chardón's claim against its insurer for damages resulting from the fuel spill.</p>\n<p>The trial court has \"broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters,\" and we review the court's denial of Wells' motion to compel \"for abuse of its considerable discretion.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.1996). This standard of review is \"not appellant-friendly,\" and we \"will intervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 549 F.3d 851, 860 (1st Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court denied Wells' motion to compel on the ground that its discovery request was \"untimely and unduly burdensome,\" a determination well-supported by the record. On April 2, 2009, Wells for the first time demanded all documents related to Chardón's insurance claim for damages arising from the fuel spill, including \"any documents submitted to your client's insurer and any correspondence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> among [the insurer] and [Chardón].\" This broad request came months after the October 14, 2008 initial scheduling conference, the date by which the court had ordered the parties to serve all interrogatories and requests for production. Wells' original request for production of documents, which was filed in September 2008, within the discovery deadlines, did not request any documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.<sup>[15]</sup> In light of this evidence, the court acted within its considerable discretion in denying Wells' motion to compel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed</i> in part, <i>vacated</i> in part, and the case is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Circuit Judge Torruella heard oral argument in this matter and thereafter recused himself. The remaining two panelists therefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(d).</p>\n<p>[1]  For example, the tenant estoppel certificates contained information about the date of the tenant's lease, the square footage of the leased property, and the amount of the security deposit, and provided assurances that the lease remained in force and had not been amended or modified except as indicated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Chardón's letter stated that \"[a]ll capitalized terms used herein that are not expressly defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The $671,804 in other \"tenant benefits\" included a $1,000 credit toward a hotel stay for each employee who facilitated a tenant's move to a temporary location, a $50-per-employee credit toward a tenant employee event, a $250 dinner-package giveaway for each floor of the building, flowers and breakfast upon the tenants' return to the building, and the equivalent of 60 days' rent for each tenant toward tenant improvements at the building. The $208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits\" included payments for third party consulting services, infrared inspection, and indoor air quality analyses.</p>\n<p>[4]  Wells' email detailed concerns with the estoppel certificates executed by six tenants. For example, the email stated that \"Goldman Antonetti alleges overpayment in rent due to a miscalculation in the SF arising from the time of the second amendment. This could obviously be a material issue for both parties\"; \"Charles Schwab alleges an outstanding demising allowance that, if not yet paid, will need to be credited to purchaser at closing. If Seller has already paid this amount, please send appropriate evidence\"; and \"[t]he ETS estoppel shows 3,205 SF, but the lease says 3,025. This appears to be a typo and needs to be fixed. A handwritten change initialed by the tenant will suffice.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  The Agreement stated that it was to be \"governed, construed, applied, and enforced\" by Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to Chardón's suggestion, Wells' statement was not a concession that it was undisputed that a reasonable estimate of the cost to repair the physical property was less than $4 million. Instead, Wells was arguing that the factual dispute over repair costs did not require a trial because Wells was entitled to summary judgment based on undisputed evidence that (1) a reasonable estimate of repair costs included both physical and lease-related repairs and (2) those combined costs exceeded $4 million.</p>\n<p>[7]  Invoking the general rule that arguments not first raised in the district court are forfeited, Chardón faults Wells for not contending in the district court that Chardón's estimates unreasonably excluded physical repairs and that a reasonable estimate of the cost even of physical repairs alone exceeded $4 million. However, Chardón misses the point. Because Chardón did not move for summary judgment on the ground that a reasonable estimate of physical repairs was less than $4 million, and because Wells did not have notice that this issue would be decided by the court sua sponte, Wells had no obligation to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue. Wells likewise had no obligation to move for summary judgment on this issue. That is especially so since Wells' position is that there was a dispute of material fact as to the total cost of repairs.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although Wells also contends that the court improperly granted sua sponte summary judgment on its resolution of contract claim, we need not reach this issue. While the court treated Wells' resolution of contract claim as if it rested only on the estoppel certificate issue, that claim also rested in part on Wells' allegation that Chardón failed to meet its contractual maintenance obligations. As discussed below, the court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Chardón fulfilled its maintenance obligations, and therefore summary judgment on the resolution of contract claim was improper.</p>\n<p>[9]  In its motion for summary judgment in the district court, Chardón pointed to certain extrinsic evidence that it contended \"confirm[ed]\" its interpretation of the \"lucid\" contractual language. However, Chardón has not argued, either in the district court or on appeal, that even if the contractual language were ambiguous, Chardón would be entitled to summary judgment based on the extrinsic evidence of intent. In any event, we cannot say that the extrinsic evidence of intent cited by Chardón was \"so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.\" <i>See </i><i>Boston Five,</i> 768 F.2d at 8. In its motion for summary judgment, Chardón primarily pointed to correspondence between the parties in which Wells disputed the reasonableness of Chardón's estimates of repair costs and pointed out physical repairs that Chardón had failed to account for. This evidence certainly indicates that Wells believed that a reasonable estimate of repair costs under Section 6.2.1 <i>included</i> physical repairs, but does not necessarily establish that Wells intended a reasonable estimate of repair costs to be <i>limited</i> to physical repairs.</p>\n<p>[10]  Wells' argument that it should be deemed to have terminated the Agreement relies in part on the language of Section 10.2, a more general provision on the purchaser's remedies in the event that the seller defaults on its obligations under the Agreement for reasons other than the purchaser's failure to perform. However, even assuming that these two sections are in conflict, Section 7.3.7, which directly and specifically addresses the parties' remedies in the event that Chardón fails to deliver the required estoppels, cannot be set aside based on the general language of Section 10.2. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Central Intern. Co. v. Kemper Nat. Ins. Cos.,</i> 202 F.3d 372 (1st Cir. 2000) (setting forth the \"ordinary principle[ ] of contract interpretation\" that \"specific language is treated as a limitation on general language\" (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 203(c) (1979))).</p>\n<p>[11]  The district court determined that \"the `as is' language contained in section 11.2 of the Agreement does not relieve [Chardón] of its specific maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3.\" Chardón does not challenge that conclusion on appeal and therefore we do not address it.</p>\n<p>[12]  RIMCO had two levels of maintenance service; Level II was the more comprehensive service.</p>\n<p>[13]  Chardón disputes this view of the scope of RIMCO's maintenance responsibilities, pointing to evidence that the RIMCO Level II inspection checklist included \"[c]hecking the function of all clocks and safety indicators\" and that RIMCO did in fact inspect the generator gauges and security indicators. However, any factual dispute on this point is for the factfinder to decide.</p>\n<p>[14]  Chardón argues that \"[w]hether or not RIMCO actually performed `good' or `bad' maintenance, or whether it maintained systems other than the generators, is totally irrelevant.\" In Chardón's view, it fulfilled its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3 simply because it \"maintained the same level of maintenance\" from the effective date of the Agreement through the purported closing date, that is, a Level II maintenance service contract with RIMCO. However, the requirements of Section 6.1.3 cannot be so easily avoided. If Chardón or its independent contractors negligently failed to maintain the back-up generators, day tanks, or fuel-pumping system in the weeks between the effective date of the contract and the closing date, a jury could reasonably find that Chardón failed to \"maintain ... all Improvements substantially in their present condition\" within the meaning of Section 6.1.3.</p>\n<p>[15]  Wells contends that documents related to Chardón's insurance claim should have been produced in response to its original requests for production, which contained a request for \"[a]ll documents concerning or relating to the Fuel Spill, and the subsequent clean-up and repairs associated therewith.\" However, this general language cannot be reasonably understood as a request for documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.</p>\n\n</div>",

(Wells) entered into an agreement with defendant Chardón/Hato Rey Partnership, S.E. (Chardón) for the purchase of a commercial building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Prior to the expected closing date, a large fuel spill occurred at the property, causing significant damage and displacing the building's tenants. Chardón insisted on proceeding to closing over Wells' objections. After Wells failed to appear for the scheduled closing, both parties filed claims for breach of contract.</p>\n<p>Wells appeals from the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Chardón on Wells' claims for breach and resolution of contract and Chardón's counter-claim for breach of contract. After careful review, we affirm the judgment in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Purchase and Sale Agreement</h2>\n<p>On January 25, 2008, Wells entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement) with Chardón by which Wells agreed to purchase the American International Plaza building in San Juan (AI Plaza) for $80 million. Pursuant to the Agreement, Wells placed a $4 million deposit in escrow and agreed to pay the $76 million balance at closing.</p>\n<p>Section 2.1 of the Agreement defined the \"Property\" that Wells agreed to purchase from Chardón:</p>\n<blockquote>2.1 <i>Property.</i> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, the Real Property, the Improvements, and all of Seller's right, title, and interest in the Leases, in the Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible Personal Property, and in the Service Contracts (as such terms are defined below) (all of which are collectively referred to as the <i>\"Property\"</i>).</blockquote>\n<p>Article 6 of the Agreement addressed \"OPERATIONS AND RISK OF LOSS.\" Section 6.1.3 set forth Chardón's ongoing maintenance obligations from the effective date of the Agreement, January 25, through closing:</p>\n<blockquote>6.1.3. <i>Maintenance of Improvements; Removal of Personal Property.</i> Subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3, Seller shall maintain or cause the tenants under the Leases to maintain (to the extent provided in such Leases) all Improvements substantially in their present condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted) and in a manner consistent with Seller's maintenance of the Improvements during Seller's period of ownership. Seller will not remove any Tangible Personal Property except as may be required for necessary repair or replacement.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 6.2, entitled \"Damage,\" set forth the parties' rights and obligations in the event that \"prior to Closing the Property is damaged by fire or other casualty.\" If such a casualty occurred, \"Seller shall estimate the cost to repair and the time required to complete repairs and will provide Purchaser written notice of Seller's estimation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> (the <i>`Casualty Notice'</i>) as soon as reasonably possible....\" Section 6.2.1 defined \"Material Damage\" as \"damage which, in Seller's reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair,\" and provided that \"[i]n the event of any Material Damage to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof prior to Closing, Purchaser may, at its option, terminate this Agreement\" and recover its deposit. Section 6.2.2 provided that if \"the Property is not Materially Damaged, then Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement;\" instead, Chardón could either repair the nonmaterial damage in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Wells or credit Wells at closing for the reasonable cost to complete the repairs.</p>\n<p>Section 7.3 required Chardón to deliver certain documents to the escrow agent on or before the closing date, including \"tenant estoppel certificates\" by which AI Plaza tenants warranted certain information about their leases.<sup>[1]</sup> Under Section 7.3.7, Chardón was required to deliver \"Tenant Estoppel Certificates for the Leases\" executed by tenants such that the tenants who executed estoppel certificates, in the aggregate, \"occupy 75% of the leasable space in the Improvements (the <i>`Required Estoppels'</i>).\" The Agreement specified that \"[i]t shall be a further condition to Purchaser's obligation to close the transaction\" that \"the Required Estoppels, do not ... reflect any material discrepancies of the terms of the Leases as compared with the terms of the Leases set forth in the copies of the Leases delivered by Seller....\" However, this section also stated that Wells' remedies for Chardón's failure to deliver the required estoppels were limited: \"If Seller is unable to deliver the Required Estoppels\" by the closing date, \"then Purchaser's sole remedies and recourses shall be limited to either (A) waiving the requirement for the tenant estoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding to Closing without reduction of the Purchase Price or (B) terminating this Agreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and recovering any deposit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Fuel Spill</h2>\n<p>Prior to closing, the transformer for AI Plaza's main electrical service failed on February 10, 2008, and the building's two diesel-powered back-up generators began operating. Late on February 11 or early on February 12, a large diesel fuel spill occurred. About 1,200 gallons of fuel spilled from the maintenance room on the building's top floor into other parts of the building. As a result of the spill, AI Plaza required significant remediation, repair, cleaning and restoration, and its tenants were forced to vacate the building. Chardón obtained the necessary clearances to reopen the building for occupancy on March 26, and the majority of tenants returned by the end of May.</p>\n<p>On February 15, Chardón notified Wells by letter that a fuel spill had occurred at AI Plaza and that Chardón's initial estimate of the cost to clean up the spill and repair the damage to repair \"the Property\" was $650,000.<sup>[2]</sup> Chardón stated that pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the Agreement, which governed nonmaterial damage, it elected to complete a portion of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> clean-up and repair prior to closing and credit Wells for the remaining costs of repair. The following week, Wells responded with concern that \"this estimate may be unduly low, and indeed the Property may have been Materially Damaged, as that term is defined in Section 6.2.1,\" and requested further information and documentation supporting Chardón's estimate.</p>\n<p>On March 6, Chardón advised Wells that it believed remediation of the fuel spill was \"95%\" complete. Chardón provided a revised estimate of $2,546,509 for the \"expected costs to complete the environmental cleanup, restoration, and subsequent certification relative to the diesel oil spill,\" and an additional $100,000 for replacement of the transformer for the building's main electric service. Wells again expressed concern about the reasonableness of Chardón's repair estimate, noting that \"we are still reviewing this latest estimate but believe that it too may fall short of fully estimating the substantial damages incurred at the Property\" due to the fuel spill.</p>\n<p>In the course of litigation, Chardón produced expert evidence that the actual total cost to repair the physical property was $3,606,407. Chardón also incurred additional costs in order to \"maintain cordial relations with the tenants,\" but did not consider these expenditures to be repair costs within the meaning of the Agreement. These additional costs included $2,343,878 in rent and other abatements to AI Plaza tenants, $671,804 in other \"tenant benefits,\" and $208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Tenant Estoppel Certificates</h2>\n<p>Prior to the fuel spill, Chardón delivered tenant estoppel certificates to Wells on February 6, 2008, pursuant to Section 7.3.7 of the Agreement. Several days later, Chardón and Wells representatives had a phone conversation in which Wells raised concerns about apparent discrepancies in several of the estoppel certificates provided, and Chardón attempted to assuage Wells' concerns. On February 11, Wells sent an email to Chardón listing \"a few issues arising under the estoppels delivered last week\" and stated that \"[t]hese matters must be resolved to Wells' satisfaction prior to closing.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On March 3, after the fuel spill, Wells reiterated to Chardón that the estoppel certificates delivered on February 6 did not satisfy Section 7.3.7 of the Agreement and that issues related to the estoppels \"remain[ed] outstanding.\" Wells further noted that in the wake of the fuel spill, local media had reported that some tenants might not return to AI Plaza, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> therefore Wells requested that Chardón provide new, satisfactory estoppel letters from all tenants. In letters dated March 11 and March 12, Wells again stated that the estoppel certificates provided on February 6 were not satisfactory and noted that new estoppels had not been provided after the fuel spill as requested. Chardón did not provide Wells with new estoppel certificates prior to closing. At the same time, Wells did not notify Chardón that it wished to terminate the Agreement due to Chardón's alleged failure to provide satisfactory estoppel certificates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Closing</h2>\n<p>Following postponement of the original closing date, on March 10, Chardón notified Wells that the new closing date would be March 14. On March 11, Wells objected to Chardón's attempt to proceed to closing at that time, stating that Chardón had \"failed to comply with its obligations and satisfy all of the conditions of Closing.\" In particular, Wells cited Chardón's failure to provide satisfactory estoppel certificates and its failure to provide a reasonable estimate of the damages to AI Plaza. Chardón appeared for closing on March 14, but Wells did not. Both parties claimed the $4 million deposit, and the escrow agent advised the parties that it would hold the funds pending resolution of the dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Proceedings in the District Court</h2>\n<p>Wells filed this action in federal district court in June 2008, alleging causes of action under Puerto Rico law<sup>[5]</sup> for breach of contract and rescission or resolution of contract. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 2994, 3018, 3052. Wells sought the return of its $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney fees, alleging that (1) a reasonable estimate of the repairs to AI Plaza exceeded $4 million and therefore constituted \"Material Damage\" under Section 6.2.1 of the Agreement, (2) Chardón failed to deliver the estoppel certificates required under Section 7.3.7 prior to closing, and (3) Chardón failed to comply with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3. Chardón filed a counterclaim alleging that Wells breached the Agreement by acting in bad faith and failing to close the transaction on March 14 and likewise sought as damages the $4 million deposit plus interest and attorney fees.</p>\n<p>Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Wells moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" included costs to repair both the physical property and the leases, and therefore the undisputed facts demonstrated that a reasonable estimate of repair costs would exceed $4 million; and (2) Chardón failed to deliver the required tenant estoppel certificates free of material discrepancies prior to closing. The motion contained no concession that the cost of physical repairs alone was less than $4 million and stated that the exact cost of repairs remained a disputed fact. Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the grounds that (1) a reasonable estimate of repairs to the \"Property\" included only physical repairs and not expenditures such as rent abatements and tenant benefits; (2) Chardón provided the required estoppel certificates and, in any event, Wells waived that requirement; and (3) Chardón fulfilled its maintenance obligations.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Chardón's motion and denied Wells' motion. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> court then dismissed Wells' complaint and entered judgment for Chardón on its counter-claim in the amount of $4 million plus interest and attorney fees. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Wells contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment for Chardón. Wells argues that the court (1) improperly granted sua sponte summary judgment as to certain issues, (2) erroneously interpreted the Agreement to mean that a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" was limited to physical repairs, (3) erred in concluding that Chardón delivered the required tenant estoppel certificates and that Wells had waived that requirement in any event, and (4) disregarded genuine issues of material fact in concluding that Chardón fulfilled its contractual maintenance obligations. Wells further contends that the court abused its discretion in denying Wells' motion to compel production of certain documents. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p>Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Velez v.

However, if the appellant was not procedurally prejudiced by the lack of adequate noticethat is, if the appellant was not deprived of the opportunity \"to present evidence in support of its position as a result of the unfair surprise\"then the failure to provide notice is harmless error. <i>P.R.

Action Refund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203140\"><a href=\"/opinion/203140/puerto-rico-elec-power-authority-v-action-refund/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court erred by entering summary judgment sua sponte as to Wells' entire Material Damage claim without appropriate notice. Wells' complaint alleged that it was entitled to recover its $4 million deposit under Section 6.2.1 because AI Plaza had suffered \"Material Damage,\" that is, damage to \"the Property\" that, in Chardón's \"reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair.\" Wells moved for summary judgment on this claim, contending that under the Agreement, a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" included repairs to both the physical property and the leases (for example, rent abatement and other tenant benefits), and that it was undisputed based on Chardón's own expert evidence that those combined costs exceeded $4 million.</p>\n<p>Chardón cross-moved for partial summary judgment only as to the contract interpretation issue. In its motion, captioned a \"motion for partial summary judgment,\" Chardón contended that based on the clear language of the Agreement, \"the Court should find, as a matter of law, that the term `repair costs' should be limited to physical repairs of the Property and that said term does not include tenant benefits, rent abatements or diminution of value.\" As the \"partial summary judgment\" caption suggests, Chardón's motion did not fully dispose of Wells' Material Damage claim: even if Chardón prevailed on the contract interpretation issue, Wells could still succeed on its claim based on proof that a reasonable estimate of the costs of <i>physical repairs alone</i> exceeded $4 million. Chardón did not move for summary dismissal of Wells' entire Material Damage claim and did not contend it was undisputed that a reasonable estimate of the cost of physical repairs alone fell below the $4 million threshold.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the court entered summary judgment on Wells' entire Material Damage claim on its own initiative, reasoning that \"[h]aving found that the cost of repair is limited to the repair of the physical structure, the Court also necessarily finds that Defendant has provided Plaintiff with a reasonable estimate of said cost\" and that this reasonable estimate was less than $4 million. Prior to making its sua sponte ruling, the court gave Wells no notice that it would decide not only the contract interpretation issue of whether a reasonable estimate of repair costs was limited to physical repairs, but also the fact-intensive issue of whether a reasonable estimate of repairs to the physical property alone exceeded $4 million. The record does not reveal any order or other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> statement from the court indicating to the parties that it might summarily decide the merits of Wells' entire Material Damage claim. Wells' own motion for summary judgment, which also addressed the Material Damage claim, further confirms the lack of notice. Wells stated in its motion that \"<i>[w]hile the exact amount to repair the damage to the Property remains a disputed fact in this litigation,</i> that dispute does not require a trial, because there are several key dispositive undisputed facts upon which this Court can enter summary judgment in Wells' favor.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, we cannot say that the court's failure to provide adequate notice was harmless. Wells contends that, if it had been on notice that its entire repair costs claim was at risk of dismissal, it would have presented evidence that Chardón's estimates of repair costs unreasonably excluded some costs related to repair of the physical structure, such as the cost of certain environmental testing at the building.<sup>[7]</sup> Wells was therefore procedurally prejudiced by the sua sponte adjudication of its claim.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Ruling that a Reasonable Estimate of Costs to Repair the \"Property\" Was Limited to Physical Repairs</h2>\n<p>Wells contends that the district court erred in concluding that a reasonable estimate of the cost to repair the Property under Section 6.2.1 \"unambiguously refers to physical damage.\" Under Puerto Rico's Civil Code,</p>\n<blockquote>If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3471. \"`[C]lear' terms are those that `in themselves are lucid enough to be understood in one sense alone, without leaving any room for doubt, controversies or difference of interpretation.'\" <i>Home Ins. Co. v. Pan American Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201431\"><a href=\"/opinion/201431/home-insurance-v-pan-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Heirs of Ramírez v.

The terms of a contract \"should be interpreted in relation to one another, giving to those that are doubtful the meaning which may appear from the consideration of all of them together.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3475. If the terms of the contract are ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the parties' intent, and summary judgment is appropriate only if the undisputed extrinsic evidence of intent \"supports only one of the conflicting interpretations.\" <i>Adria,</i> 241 F.3d at 111; <i>see also </i><i>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Secretary of Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455854\"><a href=\"/opinion/455854/the-boston-five-cents-savings-bank-v-secretary-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1985) (approving summary judgment notwithstanding textual ambiguity if \"the evidence presented about the parties' intended meaning [is] so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide the contrary\") (citing 3 <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> § 554 (1960)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the text of the Agreement is ambiguous. Section 6.2.1 provided that in the event of \"Material Damage to or destruction of the Property or any portion thereof prior to Closing,\" Wells could terminate the contract and recover its deposit. This section defined \"Material Damage\" as \"damage which, in Seller's reasonable estimation, exceeds $4,000,000 to repair.\" Wells contends that a reasonable estimate of the costs to repair the \"Property\" under this section must include not only repairs to the physical property but also repairs to the tenant leasesfor example, rent abatement and other tenant benefits. Wells' interpretation finds support in Section 2.1 of the Agreement, which defined the term <i>\"Property\"</i> to include \"the Real Property, the Improvements, and all of Seller's right, title, and interest in the Leases, in the Tangible Personal Property, in the Intangible Personal Property, and in the Service Contracts.\" The Agreement further specified that all defined terms, which were indicated by initial capital letters, \"shall have the meaning set forth herein.\" Thus, for purposes of their contractual dealings, the parties took care to specially define the term \"Property\" in a manner somewhat different from its ordinary meaning. <i>See </i><i>In re Blinds to go Share Purchase Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793856\"><a href=\"/opinion/793856/in-re-blinds-to-go-share-purchase-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Where the parties to a contract take pains to define a key term specially, their dealings under the contract are governed by that definition.\")</p>\n<p>We further note that Wells and Chardón, sophisticated parties represented by counsel, agreed to distinct definitions of the terms \"Real Property\" (the land), \"Improvements\" (the structures, fixtures, equipment and machinery), and \"Property\" (the real property, improvements, and leases, among other interests). Elsewhere in the Agreement, the parties used the terms \"Real Property\" or \"Improvements\" rather than the more inclusive term \"Property.\" If the parties intended a reasonable estimate of the cost of repairs under Section 6.2.1 to include repairs to the physical property only, they could easily have referred to damage to the \"Real Property and Improvements\" rather than damage to the \"Property.\"</p>\n<p>Chardón counters that a reasonable estimate of the costs to repair the Property under this section included only repairs to the physical property, that is, to the land and building. This interpretation, too, finds support in the text of the Agreement. Section 6.2.1 spoke of \"damage\" and \"repair\" to the Property, words that, at least as commonly used, make little sense in the context of tenant leases. In addition, Section 6.2.2, which discussed nonmaterial damage, provided that the reasonable cost to complete repairs was to be determined by \"an architect or engineer,\" both of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> which are professionals with expertise in assessing the cost of repairs to physical property, not repairs to tenant leases.</p>\n<p>Given that the text of the Agreement reasonably supports multiple, conflicting interpretations, the district court erred in concluding a reasonable estimate of costs to repair the \"Property\" unambiguously referred only to physical repairs. On remand, the factfinder should consider extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent as to the meaning of the Agreement on this issue. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3472 (in evaluating the parties' intent, \"attention must principally be paid to [the parties'] acts, contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Tenant Estoppel Certificates</h2>\n<p>Wells next contends that the court erred in concluding that Chardón provided the required tenant estoppel certificates free of material discrepancies and, alternatively, that Wells waived that requirement. We need not reach the question of whether Chardón provided adequate estoppel certificates because even assuming it did not, we conclude that Wells has no remedy for this failure under the clear terms of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>As a condition of Wells' obligation to close the transaction, the Agreement required that Chardón provide Wells with tenant estoppel certificates, free of material discrepancies, from certain AI Plaza tenants. However, Section 7.3.7(c) of the Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]otwithstanding anything herein to the contrary... if Seller is unable to deliver the Required Estoppels\" by the closing date, \"then Purchaser's <i>sole remedies and recourses shall be limited to either</i> (A) waiving the requirement for the tenant estoppel certificate(s) in question and proceeding to Closing without reduction of the Purchase Price or (B) terminating this Agreement by immediate notification to Seller\" and recovering its deposit. (Emphasis added.) Under the Agreement, notices such as that required by subsection (B) had to be in writing.</p>\n<p>Wells strenuously argues that it did not waive the estoppel certificate requirement within the meaning of subsection (A) because in the weeks prior to closing, Wells repeatedly informed Chardón that some of the estoppels provided were inadequate under Section 7.3.7 and requested that new, compliant estoppels be delivered. At the same time, Wells concedes that it did not terminate the Agreement by written notice due to Chardón's alleged failure to provide the required estoppels free of material discrepancies, as permitted by subsection (B).</p>\n<p>Faced with its failure to pursue either of the remedies set forth in Section 7.3.7, Wells contends that Section 7.3.7 \"is silent about what happens if Wells does not elect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> either option\" and argues that in this circumstance it should be deemed to have terminated the Agreement. But Section 7.3.7 is not silent about Wells' remedies in the event that it declines to select either optioninstead, this section unambiguously states that Wells' \"sole remedies and recourses\" are \"limited\" to the two enumerated courses of action. We cannot, as Wells urges, ignore the Agreement's references to \"sole\" and \"limited\" remedies and rewrite the Agreement to provide a third avenue of relief. Because Wells chose not to pursue either of the options provided by Section 7.3.7(c), it has no remedy or recourse for Chardón's alleged failure to provide the required estoppels.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Maintenance Obligations</h2>\n<p>Wells further contends that the court overlooked genuine issues of material fact in concluding that Chardón complied with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>Section 6.1.3 imposed an ongoing obligation on Chardón, from the effective date of the Agreement (January 25) through closing, to \"maintain ... all Improvements substantially in their present condition (ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted) and in a manner consistent with Seller's maintenance of the Improvements during Seller's period of ownership.\"<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Wells, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Chardón maintained all \"Improvements,\" in particular the building's back-up generators and associated fuel tanks and fuel-pumping system, substantially in their present condition and in a manner consistent with Chardón's maintenance during its ownership. On February 10, the transformer for AI Plaza's primary electrical service failed and the building's two back-up generators were activated. The back-up generators were powered by diesel fuel. A fuel-pumping system transported diesel fuel from large storage tanks in the building's basement to two smaller day tanks located on the top floor mechanical room. Late on February 11 or early on the morning of February 12, a control panel on the day tanks malfunctioned. As a result, the pumping system continued to pump fuel into the two day tanks even after they were full, causing them to overflow. Although the system sounded an alarm, it was only audible on one level of the building and was not heard for several hours. By the time the problem was discovered, about 1,200 gallons of fuel had spilled from the mechanical room into utility shafts, electrical ducts, and other parts of the building.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> In granting summary judgment for Chardón, the district court relied on largely undisputed evidence of Chardón's preventive maintenance of the back-up generators. In June 2007, Chardón entered into an annual maintenance service contract with RIMCO, Inc., for the maintenance of the generators, pursuant to which RIMCO provided \"Level II\"<sup>[12]</sup> preventive maintenance on both generators twice annually. The last regular Level II maintenance visit before the fuel spill occurred in November 2007, and the next visit was scheduled for May 2008. On February 11, 2008, after the back-up generators were activated, RIMCO performed a \"Level I\" preventive inspection of the back-up generators at Chardón's request and found them to be in good operating condition. Shortly after the fuel spill, on February 14, RIMCO returned for another maintenance visit and found that a control panel on the day tanks was \"frozen.\" The RIMCO technician reset the control panel, tested it, and found it operational. As a preventive measure, the technician then replaced the control panels at Chardón's request. The generators were again found to be in good operating condition. Based on this evidence, the court concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether Chardón complied with its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3.</p>\n<p>However, additional evidence proffered by Wells, which was not mentioned by the district court, raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Chardón and/or its independent contractor, RIMCO, negligently maintained the building's back-up generators and associated fuel-pumping system in the days before the fuel spill. First, Wells produced evidence that the systems likely responsible for the spill, the fuel-pumping system and day tank control panels, were not within the scope of RIMCO's responsibility or expertise. RIMCO representatives testified that Chardón contracted with RIMCO to inspect and maintain only the generators themselves. RIMCO was not hired to perform, and did not have the technical expertise to perform, service and maintenance of the fuel-pumping system, the valves for the fuel-pumping system, the day tank control panels, or the alarm system. On February 11, the day before the fuel spill, the RIMCO technician did not inspect the day tank control panels or fuel-pumping system.<sup>[13]</sup> There is no evidence that anyone other than RIMCO was hired to inspect and maintain these associated systems.</p>\n<p>Second, Wells produced evidence that Chardón's preventive maintenance of the generators between semiannual RIMCO inspections was not in accordance with the guidelines in the manufacturer's manual. For example, although the manufacturer recommended weekly operational checks of the generators, Chardón's logbooks indicated that it ordinarily performed only monthly operational checks.</p>\n<p>Third, Wells produced evidence that in February 2009, Chardón and its insurer filed suit against RIMCO and other independent contractors alleging negligence in the installation and maintenance of the electrical transformer, back-up generators, and associated systems. The suit claimed, inter alia, that RIMCO was negligent in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> \"not installing or appropriately maintaining, testing, inspecting, and/or repairing the diesel-driven backup generator systems, including the day tanks, in such a way as to ensure that the appropriate precautions were taken to avoid an overflow of diesel fuel from the day tanks.\" Chardón does not dispute that its contractor's negligence may be imputed to it for purposes of this contractual obligation. Such imputation would be consistent with certain tort law principles. <i>See </i><i>Colmenares Vivas v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480735\"><a href=\"/opinion/480735/jose-domingo-colmenares-vivas-v-sun-alliance-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span>, 1107 (1st Cir.1986) (stating \"general principle\" that the duty to keep business premises reasonably safe cannot be delegated to a third party (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 344 (1965))); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts § 425 (property owner who \"employs an independent contractor to maintain in safe condition land which he holds open to the entry of the public as his place of business\" is liable for contractor's negligence).</p>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to Wells, the evidence permits a finding that Chardón did not fulfill its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3. A reasonable jury could find that Chardón and/or RIMCO negligently maintained the back-up generators, day tanks, and fuel-pumping system in the days leading up to the fuel spill, and that Chardón thereby failed in its ongoing obligation to maintain these \"Improvements\" substantially in their present condition and in a manner consistent with Chardón's maintenance during its ownership of the property.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Motion to Compel</h2>\n<p>Finally, Wells contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion to compel production of documents related to Chardón's claim against its insurer for damages resulting from the fuel spill.</p>\n<p>The trial court has \"broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters,\" and we review the court's denial of Wells' motion to compel \"for abuse of its considerable discretion.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena v.

This standard of review is \"not appellant-friendly,\" and we \"will intervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Dennis v.

On April 2, 2009, Wells for the first time demanded all documents related to Chardón's insurance claim for damages arising from the fuel spill, including \"any documents submitted to your client's insurer and any correspondence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> among [the insurer] and [Chardón].\" This broad request came months after the October 14, 2008 initial scheduling conference, the date by which the court had ordered the parties to serve all interrogatories and requests for production. Wells' original request for production of documents, which was filed in September 2008, within the discovery deadlines, did not request any documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.<sup>[15]</sup> In light of this evidence, the court acted within its considerable discretion in denying Wells' motion to compel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed</i> in part, <i>vacated</i> in part, and the case is <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The remaining two panelists therefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(d).</p>\n<p>[1]  For example, the tenant estoppel certificates contained information about the date of the tenant's lease, the square footage of the leased property, and the amount of the security deposit, and provided assurances that the lease remained in force and had not been amended or modified except as indicated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Chardón's letter stated that \"[a]ll capitalized terms used herein that are not expressly defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The $671,804 in other \"tenant benefits\" included a $1,000 credit toward a hotel stay for each employee who facilitated a tenant's move to a temporary location, a $50-per-employee credit toward a tenant employee event, a $250 dinner-package giveaway for each floor of the building, flowers and breakfast upon the tenants' return to the building, and the equivalent of 60 days' rent for each tenant toward tenant improvements at the building. The $208,489 in \"payments related to tenant benefits\" included payments for third party consulting services, infrared inspection, and indoor air quality analyses.</p>\n<p>[4]  Wells' email detailed concerns with the estoppel certificates executed by six tenants. For example, the email stated that \"Goldman Antonetti alleges overpayment in rent due to a miscalculation in the SF arising from the time of the second amendment. This could obviously be a material issue for both parties\"; \"Charles Schwab alleges an outstanding demising allowance that, if not yet paid, will need to be credited to purchaser at closing. If Seller has already paid this amount, please send appropriate evidence\"; and \"[t]he ETS estoppel shows 3,205 SF, but the lease says 3,025. This appears to be a typo and needs to be fixed. A handwritten change initialed by the tenant will suffice.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  The Agreement stated that it was to be \"governed, construed, applied, and enforced\" by Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to Chardón's suggestion, Wells' statement was not a concession that it was undisputed that a reasonable estimate of the cost to repair the physical property was less than $4 million. Instead, Wells was arguing that the factual dispute over repair costs did not require a trial because Wells was entitled to summary judgment based on undisputed evidence that (1) a reasonable estimate of repair costs included both physical and lease-related repairs and (2) those combined costs exceeded $4 million.</p>\n<p>[7]  Invoking the general rule that arguments not first raised in the district court are forfeited, Chardón faults Wells for not contending in the district court that Chardón's estimates unreasonably excluded physical repairs and that a reasonable estimate of the cost even of physical repairs alone exceeded $4 million. However, Chardón misses the point. Because Chardón did not move for summary judgment on the ground that a reasonable estimate of physical repairs was less than $4 million, and because Wells did not have notice that this issue would be decided by the court sua sponte, Wells had no obligation to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue. Wells likewise had no obligation to move for summary judgment on this issue. That is especially so since Wells' position is that there was a dispute of material fact as to the total cost of repairs.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although Wells also contends that the court improperly granted sua sponte summary judgment on its resolution of contract claim, we need not reach this issue. While the court treated Wells' resolution of contract claim as if it rested only on the estoppel certificate issue, that claim also rested in part on Wells' allegation that Chardón failed to meet its contractual maintenance obligations. As discussed below, the court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Chardón fulfilled its maintenance obligations, and therefore summary judgment on the resolution of contract claim was improper.</p>\n<p>[9]  In its motion for summary judgment in the district court, Chardón pointed to certain extrinsic evidence that it contended \"confirm[ed]\" its interpretation of the \"lucid\" contractual language. However, Chardón has not argued, either in the district court or on appeal, that even if the contractual language were ambiguous, Chardón would be entitled to summary judgment based on the extrinsic evidence of intent. In any event, we cannot say that the extrinsic evidence of intent cited by Chardón was \"so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.\" <i>See </i><i>Boston Five,</i> 768 F.2d at 8. In its motion for summary judgment, Chardón primarily pointed to correspondence between the parties in which Wells disputed the reasonableness of Chardón's estimates of repair costs and pointed out physical repairs that Chardón had failed to account for. This evidence certainly indicates that Wells believed that a reasonable estimate of repair costs under Section 6.2.1 <i>included</i> physical repairs, but does not necessarily establish that Wells intended a reasonable estimate of repair costs to be <i>limited</i> to physical repairs.</p>\n<p>[10]  Wells' argument that it should be deemed to have terminated the Agreement relies in part on the language of Section 10.2, a more general provision on the purchaser's remedies in the event that the seller defaults on its obligations under the Agreement for reasons other than the purchaser's failure to perform. However, even assuming that these two sections are in conflict, Section 7.3.7, which directly and specifically addresses the parties' remedies in the event that Chardón fails to deliver the required estoppels, cannot be set aside based on the general language of Section 10.2. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Central Intern. Co. v. Kemper Nat. Ins. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198778\"><a href=\"/opinion/198778/central-internationa-v-kemper-insurance-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2000) (setting forth the \"ordinary principle[ ] of contract interpretation\" that \"specific language is treated as a limitation on general language\" (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 203(c) (1979))).</p>\n<p>[11]  The district court determined that \"the `as is' language contained in section 11.2 of the Agreement does not relieve [Chardón] of its specific maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3.\" Chardón does not challenge that conclusion on appeal and therefore we do not address it.</p>\n<p>[12]  RIMCO had two levels of maintenance service; Level II was the more comprehensive service.</p>\n<p>[13]  Chardón disputes this view of the scope of RIMCO's maintenance responsibilities, pointing to evidence that the RIMCO Level II inspection checklist included \"[c]hecking the function of all clocks and safety indicators\" and that RIMCO did in fact inspect the generator gauges and security indicators. However, any factual dispute on this point is for the factfinder to decide.</p>\n<p>[14]  Chardón argues that \"[w]hether or not RIMCO actually performed `good' or `bad' maintenance, or whether it maintained systems other than the generators, is totally irrelevant.\" In Chardón's view, it fulfilled its maintenance obligations under Section 6.1.3 simply because it \"maintained the same level of maintenance\" from the effective date of the Agreement through the purported closing date, that is, a Level II maintenance service contract with RIMCO. However, the requirements of Section 6.1.3 cannot be so easily avoided. If Chardón or its independent contractors negligently failed to maintain the back-up generators, day tanks, or fuel-pumping system in the weeks between the effective date of the contract and the closing date, a jury could reasonably find that Chardón failed to \"maintain ... all Improvements substantially in their present condition\" within the meaning of Section 6.1.3.</p>\n<p>[15]  Wells contends that documents related to Chardón's insurance claim should have been produced in response to its original requests for production, which contained a request for \"[a]ll documents concerning or relating to the Fuel Spill, and the subsequent clean-up and repairs associated therewith.\" However, this general language cannot be reasonably understood as a request for documents related to Chardón's insurance claim.</p>\n\n</div>",
