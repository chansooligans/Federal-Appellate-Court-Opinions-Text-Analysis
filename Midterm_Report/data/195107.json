Appellant brought  an  in forma  pauperis\n                                                             \n\naction under 42 U.S.C.    1983 against the United States, the\n\nstate  of New  Hampshire  and  several  state  agencies,  the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and an agency, the New Hampshire\n\nBar Association,  and  various  corporate  defendants.    The\n\ndistrict  court   ordered  appellant  to  submit  an  amended\n\ncomplaint  describing more  specifically  the  nature of  his\n\nclaims  against  the  various defendants.
