Plaintiff-Apellants, several\n\nresidents of Las Gladiolas I and II public housing project (Las\n\nGladiolas), appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of several officers of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and\n\nthe Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration (PRPHA) and the\n\ndismissal of their claims against the Department of Housing and\n\nUrban Development (HUD).1   Appellants claim that in preparing and\n\napproving an application for demolition of Las Gladiolas the PRPHA\n\nand HUD violated their statutory right to resident consultation\n\nunder section 1437p of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437p(a),2 and their constitutional right to procedural\n\ndue process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United\n\nStates Constitution.

Class\ncertification was never granted as the district court dismissed all\nof Appellants' claims.\n2\n    42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b)(2) provides:\n     \"The Secretary shall disapprove an application [for\n     demolition or disposition] . . . if the Secretary\n     determines that (1) any certification made by the public\n     housing agency under that subsection is clearly\n     inconsistent with information and data available to the\n     Secretary or information or data requested by the\n     Secretary; or (2) the application was not developed in\n     consultation with-- (A) residents who will be affected by\n     the proposed demolition or disposition; (B) each resident\n     advisory board and resident council . . . that will be\n     affected by the proposed demolition or disposition; . .\n     . .\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                -4-\n\fabandoned upkeep of Las Gladiolas in an effort to justify the\n\ndemolition of some of the buildings.       After careful consideration,\n\nwe affirm the district court's dismissal of Appellants' claims.\n\n                  I. Facts and Procedural Background\n\n             The Las Gladiolas project has two high-rise buildings\n\nthat house 676 apartment units.           On April 28, 2005, the PRPHA\n\nsubmitted its application to HUD for demolition of Las Gladiolas\n\nstating that structural tests revealed that the buildings were no\n\nlonger suited for public housing purposes and that no reasonable\n\nand   cost-effective   plan   for   repairs    or   \"modernization\"   was\n\nfeasible.3\n\n             Prior to submitting its application for demolition, the\n\nPRPHA held five public hearings to discuss its Annual Plans.          Each\n\nAnnual Plan included demolition of Las Gladiolas as one of the\n\nagency's objectives, and demolition of Las Gladiolas was discussed\n\nin each of the five annual hearings.          The hearings were held on\n\nApril 2, 2001, March 27, 2002, March 28, 2003, March 25, 2004, and\n\nMarch 30, 2005.    The hearings were announced in local newspapers.\n\nThe published notices included the dates and locations of the\n\n\n\n3\n    The primary statutory criteria for demolition of a public\nhousing project are: (i) that the project is obsolete as to\nphysical condition, location, or other factors, making it\nunsuitable for housing purposes; and (ii) no reasonable program of\nmodifications is cost-effective to return the public housing\nproject or portion of the project to useful life. 42 U.S.C. § 1437\np(a)(1)(A).     Appellants have not challenged the PRPHA's\ncertification that Las Gladiolas met the criteria for demolition.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhearings; provided directions to a location where residents could\n\nview the plans; and informed residents that transportation to the\n\nhearings would be provided.         Many Las Gladiolas residents attended\n\nthese public hearings and voiced their concerns.4\n\n           On February 22, 2005, the PRPHA held a two hour and\n\nforty-five minute meeting with Las Gladiolas I & II's residents'\n\ncouncil   and    Las   Gladiolas    residents      to   discuss,   among    other\n\nmatters, the proposed demolition.            After this meeting, the PRPHA\n\nformally filed its application for demolition of the housing\n\nproject   with   HUD.      HUD    approved   the   PRPHA's    application    for\n\ndemolition on February 2, 2006.\n\n           Following      HUD's     approval    of      the   application    for\n\ndemolition, Appellants filed a class action suit on behalf of all\n\nresidents of Las Gladiolas seeking to stop or delay the demolition\n\nof Las Gladiolas.       The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief against the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the\n\nSecretary of the Department of Housing of Puerto Rico; and the\n\nDirector of the PRPHA in their official capacities (collectively,\n\nCommonwealth defendants); and against three HUD officers in their\n\nofficial capacities, namely, the Secretary of HUD; HUD's Field\n\nOffice Director for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; and HUD's\n\nDirector of Public Housing for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n\n4\n     During a March 11, 2002 meeting with residents, the PRPHA's\nplans for demolition were discussed.    The minutes of this last\nmeeting, however, were not submitted to the district court.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fThe complaint alleged that Plaintiffs had been deprived of their\n\ndue process right to consultation and of their statutory right to\n\nconsultation as recognized in 42 U.S.C. § 1437p.         Appellants also\n\nbrought a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1437p and 24 C.F.R. § 970.12,\n\nasserting that through inaction and neglect, the Commonwealth\n\ndefendants had kept two of the four buildings at Las Gladiolas in\n\na state of disrepair that amounted to the de facto or constructive\n\ndemolition of those buildings.      As to HUD, the complaint claimed\n\nthat   the   agency's   approval   of    the   PRPHA's   application   for\n\ndemolition was illegal because the application was not developed in\n\nconsultation with residents as required by section 1437p.5\n\n             In due course, the Commonwealth defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment.    The HUD defendants filed a Motion In Support of\n\n[the] Commonwealth Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment arguing\n\nthat if the Commonwealth was found to have complied with the\n\nstatutory requirements for resident consultation, HUD's approval of\n\nthe application for demolition would also be in compliance with the\n\nregulations and therefore summary judgment should be granted in\n\nHUD's favor.\n\n             In December 2008, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in the Commonwealth defendants' favor, finding that the\n\n\n5\n    In November 2005, Aponte filed an administrative complaint\nbefore HUD challenging the alleged unlawful actions taken by the\nCommonwealth defendants and requesting HUD's intervention. At the\ntime the briefs were filed in this case, HUD had not officially\nresponded to Aponte's administrative complaint.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fPRPHA had complied with the resident consultation requirement as\n\nprescribed in section 1437p and that Appellants had failed to show\n\nthat there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the\n\nCommonwealth defendants had failed to maintain Las Gladiolas.\n\nApproximately     one    month    later,      the   district   court     dismissed\n\nAppellants' claims against HUD, finding that HUD \"did not act\n\nunlawfully   in   approving       the     demolition.\"     Aponte-Rosario       v.\n\nAcevedo-Vilá, No. 06-1578, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. Jan. 29, 2009).\n\nAppellants   filed      this   timely     appeal    challenging    the   district\n\ncourt's dismissal of their claims.\n\n          II. Preliminary Issues and Standard of Review\n\nA. Appellants' Right of Action Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 5 U.S.C.\n§ 702\n          Appellants' main claim on appeal is that they were\n\ndeprived of their right to consultation as recognized in section\n\n1437p of the United States Housing Act.                   Appellants asserted\n\njurisdiction    for     the    resident    consultation    claim    against   the\n\nCommonwealth defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and against HUD\n\nunder section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 702.\n\n          The district court did not consider whether section 1437p\n\nprovides Appellants a right enforceable under section 1983 and the\n\nparties did not raise the question on appeal.6                 While we harbor\n\n\n6\n   The issue, however, was raised by this court at oral argument\nand the parties filed supplemental letters under Rule 28j\ndiscussing whether a private right of action exists.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdoubts as to whether section 1473p confers upon Appellants a\n\nprivate right of action, and at least one circuit has held that\n\nresidents   of   a   public   housing    complex   do   not    have   such    an\n\nunambiguous and \"privately enforceable federal right to prevent the\n\ndemolition of their housing developments,\" Anderson v. Jackson, 556\n\nF.3d 351, 356, 358 (5th Cir. 2009), we decline to address the issue\n\nhere. We thus assume, without deciding, that Appellants may pursue\n\na cause of action under section 1437p.\n\n            The question whether determination of the existence of a\n\nprivate cause of action is a jurisdictional inquiry or instead one\n\nthat goes to the merits of the claim is a thorny one.            Although we\n\nare obliged to decide as a threshold matter certain jurisdictional\n\nquestions that implicate our authority to hear a dispute under\n\nArticle III, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S.\n\n83, 94, 101-02 (1998), we are not so constrained where, as here,\n\nissues of statutory jurisdiction are in play,            Restoration Pres.\n\nMasonry, Inc. v. Grove Eur. Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 59-60 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also Davignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(appellate court remains free to bypass problematic jurisdictional\n\nissues   provided    those    issues    do   not   implicate    Article      III\n\nrequirements); Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 197 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (same).\n\n            We also assume, without deciding, that Appellants have a\n\nvalid claim under section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(APA) against HUD and proceed accordingly.7                  See Air Courier\n\nConference of Am. v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 523\n\nn.3 (1991) (\"Whether a cause of action exists [under the APA] is\n\nnot a question of jurisdiction, and may be assumed without being\n\ndecided.\" (citing Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 476 n.5 (1979));\n\nsee also R.I. Dep't. of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[W]hether the APA provides for judicial review\n\nof   [a]   nonfinal   ruling    is   not    [a   question]    that,   precisely\n\nspeaking,    implicates   the    subject-matter       jurisdiction      of   the\n\ncourt.\").\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment, \"taking the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom\n\nin the light most favorable to [Appellants].\"                Hoyos v. Telecorp\n\nCommc'ns, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).          Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate if there are no genuine issues as to any material fact\n\nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n7\n   In an order issued on February 7, 2007, the district court\ndenied HUD's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b) motion to\ndismiss Appellants' claims for failure to state a cause of action\nagainst HUD.    In its motion, HUD argued that the decision to\napprove the PRPHA's application for demolition was committed to the\nSecretary's discretion and was thus unreviewable pursuant to\nsection 701(a)(2) of the APA. The district court, however, never\nconsidered whether Appellants had a valid claim under APA section\n702, which provides a cause of action for any \"person suffering\nlegal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or\naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant\nstatute. . . .\" 5 U.S.C. § 702.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see, e.g., Collazo v. Nicholson, 535 F.3d\n\n41, 44 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                             III. Discussion\n\nA. Resident Consultation Claim Against the Commonwealth Defendants\n\n           Appellants challenge the adequacy and sufficiency of the\n\nprocedures employed by the PRPHA to consult with residents.                They\n\ncontend that neither the annual hearings held by the PRPHA nor the\n\nFebruary 25, 2005 meeting with Las Gladiolas residents satisfied\n\nthe statutory requirement of consultation.         Appellants argue that\n\nthe   notices   that   announced   both   the   annual   hearings    and    the\n\nFebruary 25th meeting were inadequate because they did not specify\n\nthat demolition of Las Gladiolas was to be discussed.               They also\n\nclaim that residents were not afforded a meaningful opportunity to\n\nbe heard because the annual meetings covered a panoply of issues\n\napart from demolition, and the final meeting with residents was\n\nheld just a few months prior to the filing of the application for\n\ndemolition and other topics like relocation were discussed.\n\n           Section 1437p governs demolition of a public housing\n\nproject and provides that the Secretary of HUD shall not approve an\n\napplication for demolition unless certain conditions are met. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437p.    Section 1437p(b) provides that\n\n           [t]he    Secretary   shall    disapprove    an\n           application [for demolition] if the Secretary\n           determines that . . . (2) the application was\n           not developed in consultation with (A)\n           residents who will be affected by the proposed\n           demolition or disposition; (B) each resident\n\n                                   -11-\n\f          advisory board and resident council, if any,\n          of the project (or portion thereof) that will\n          be affected by the proposed demolition or\n          disposition; and (C) appropriate government\n          officials.\n\n(emphasis added).8 The statute does not define \"consultation,\" and\n\nit does not provide specific requirements as to what type of notice\n\nmust be given, how many times consultation must occur, how many\n\nresidents must be present when demolition is discussed, or what\n\nopportunities residents must be provided to voice their opinions as\n\nto demolition before the local housing authority may be deemed to\n\nhave satisfied the general consultation requirement.\n\n          Following the general guidelines set forth by section\n\n1437p, the PRPHA held five public hearings from 2001 to 2005 to\n\ndiscuss the PRPHA's Annual Plans.     The Annual Plans of those five\n\nyears indicated that there was a planned application for demolition\n\nof Las Gladiolas and included a time line for the anticipated start\n\nand end dates for demolition. Las Gladiolas residents were present\n\nat these annual hearings9 and voiced their concerns regarding the\n\n\n8\n   The regulation that was in effect when the PRPHA submitted its\napplication for demolition provided that the public housing\nauthority's application for demolition should include \"[a]\ndescription of the PHA's consultations with tenants and any tenant\norganizations . . . with copies of any written comments which may\nhave been submitted to the PHA and the PHA's evaluation of the\ncomments.\" 24 C.F.R. § 970.8 (2005).\n9\n  Approximately eighty Las Gladiolas residents attended the April\n2001 hearing; twenty-nine residents attended the March 2002\nhearing; thirty-one residents attended the March 2003 hearing; one\nresident attended the March 2004 hearing; and six residents\nattended the March 2005 hearing.\n\n                               -12-\n\fPRPHA's plan for demolition.         For example, Aponte voiced his\n\nopposition to the demolition on at least three of the hearings.10\n\n          Besides holding annual hearings in each of the five years\n\nprior to the filing of the PRPHA's application for demolition,\n\nPRPHA officials met with members of Las Gladiolas residents'\n\ncouncil on October 18, 2001. Among other issues, they discussed an\n\nimplosion update for Las Gladiolas.          An additional and final\n\nmeeting specifically for Las Gladiolas residents was held on\n\nFebruary 22, 2005 to discuss \"important matters for the benefit of\n\nthe community.\"   The attendance sheet shows that approximately 170\n\nLas Gladiolas residents attended this meeting to discuss relocation\n\nconcerns, the possibility of the building's rehabilitation, and\n\nissues regarding demolition.       Although the meeting's minutes show\n\nthat relocation was the residents' principal concern, they also\n\nreveal that residents, including Aponte, were able to express their\n\nconcerns as to why the PRPHA had opted for demolition.11\n\n          We   note   that   the   PRPHA's   efforts   to   consult   with\n\nresidents were by no means ideal or extensive.         For example, the\n\npublished notices for both the annual hearings and the February\n\n\n\n10\n   Aponte testified at the April 2, 2001, March 27, 2002, and March\n28, 2003 hearings and stated his opposition to the proposed\ndemolition.   He also acknowledged that some residents favored\ndemolition.\n11\n   The minutes show that Aponte questioned the agency's explanation\nthat rehabilitation or remodeling was not feasible due to budgetary\nconstraints.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f22nd meeting did not indicate that demolition of Las Gladiolas was\n\nto be discussed, and there is no indication in the record that the\n\nPRPHA informed residents in any other manner that demolition would\n\nbe discussed in the annual hearings.          Cf. Anderson, 556 F.3d at 360\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in district court's denial of\n\npreliminary injunction where the record showed that the local\n\nhousing authority notified residents by mail of a meeting on the\n\nproposed   demolition   which       residents      attended    and   where   an\n\nadditional meeting was held with resident leaders to discuss\n\ndemolition); Project B.A.S.I.C. v.

Supp. 1501, 1511\n\n(D.R.I. 1989) (noting that consultation was met where the local\n\nhousing authority informed members of the tenant association of the\n\nplan for demolition; established a modernization committee with\n\ntenants; and allowed tenants to comment on the proposed demolition\n\nduring   public   meetings   held    by     the   Board   of   Commissioners).\n\nFurthermore, the annual hearings were not the ideal forum in which\n\ndemolitions should be addressed as the hearings were held to\n\ndiscuss a broad range of public housing issues.\n\n           Despite the limitations of the consultation performed by\n\nthe PRPHA, the record shows that the PRPHA took affirmative actions\n\nto inform residents about the plans for demolition, and residents\n\nwere afforded the opportunity, throughout the course of five years,\n\nto voice their concerns and provide comments regarding demolition.\n\nMoreover, the procedures employed by the PRPHA were effective as\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fthe residents, including Aponte, attended these meetings and were\n\nput on notice of the PRPHA's plan for demolition.         Residents not\n\nonly provided comments to the PRPHA in the annual hearings and the\n\nFebruary 22nd meeting, but they also requested and were granted a\n\nmeeting with the Secretary of the Commonwealth's Department of\n\nHousing to discuss demolition,12 and were able to voice their\n\nconcerns regarding demolition in other forums such as a committee\n\nof the Puerto Rico legislature.13\n\n             Although the process employed by the PRPHA was far from\n\nexemplary,   the   record   clearly   supports   the   conclusion   that,\n\nthroughout the course of five years, the PRPHA obtained comments\n\nfrom several residents and met with residents and the appointed\n\nresidents' council on several occasions.         We find that this is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the consultation requirement set forth in\n\nsection 1437p(b).14\n\n\n12\n   In his testimony at the 2002 annual hearing, Aponte explained\nthat a group of residents requested and was granted a meeting with\nthe Secretary of the Department of Housing of the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico, Ileana Echegoyen, to discuss demolition.\n13\n    The record shows that residents voiced their opposition to\ndemolition before a legislative committee and they also enlisted\nthe help of the School of Social Work of the University of Puerto\nRico in submitting alternative proposals to the PRPHA. The PRPHA\nalso established a support center that provided information and\ncounseling on demolition and relocation. However, the record does\nnot reveal whether the center was established prior to the filing\nof the PRPHA's application for demolition.\n14\n   Appellants argue there is a genuine issue of material fact as\nto whether the PRPHA consulted with the resident organization Las\nGladiolas Vive. Appellants, however, have not offered any evidence\n\n                                 -15-\n\fB. Due Process Claim\n\n           Appellants also claim that their rights to constitutional\n\nprocedural due process were infringed.              Appellants due process\n\nargument is inextricably bound to their contention that the PRPHA\n\ndid not develop its application in consultation with Las Gladiolas\n\nresidents.       They     concede   that     the    statutory        consultation\n\nrequirement complies with the minimum due process guarantees, but\n\ncontend that these procedural guarantees were not afforded in this\n\ncase.\n\n           The   threshold    question       in   any   claim      for   denial   of\n\nprocedural due process is whether plaintiffs were deprived of a\n\nliberty   or   property    interest    protected        by   the   United   States\n\nConstitution.    Lowe v. Scott, 959 F.2d 323, 334 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nIf a protected interest is found, we must then determine what\n\nprocess was due.    Goss v. López, 419 U.S. 565, 577 (1975).                \"[D]ue\n\nprocess is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands.\"         Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n\n481 (1972).    Despite this flexibility, it is well-settled that the\n\n\n\nshowing that Las Gladiolas Vive is a resident advisory board or\nresidents'    council    that    should    be   consulted    under\nsection 1437p(b)(2). Instead, they claim they are not required to\noffer proof at this stage in the proceedings regarding the\norganization's existence. Appellants' conclusory and unsupported\nassertion is insufficient to overcome the Commonwealth defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment. Martínez-Rodríguez v. Guevara, 597\nF.3d 414, 419 (1st Cir. 2010). Moreover, the record shows that the\nPRPHA met with the established residents' council of Las Gladiolas\nI and II prior to submitting the application for demolition.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fessential requirements of procedural due process include adequate\n\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard \"at a meaningful time and in\n\na meaningful manner.\"   Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 753 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nJordan Hosp., Inc. v. Shalala, 276 F.3d 72, 78 (1st Cir. 2002).   In\n\nevaluating the adequacy of the procedures employed we \"balanc[e] a\n\nnumber of factors, including the nature of the private and public\n\ninterests involved; the risk of erroneous deprivation accruing under\n\nthe procedures used by the state; and the probable benefit of\n\ndemanding additional procedural safeguards.\"    Amsden, 904 F.2d at\n\n753; see also Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).\n\n          Appellants rely on persuasive authority to show that they\n\nhave a protected property interest that would trigger procedural due\n\nprocess protections.    See Geneva Towers Tenants Org. v. Federated\n\nMortg. Investors, 504 F.2d 483, 488-92 (9th Cir. 1974) (holding that\n\ntenants of federally subsidized housing project had a protected\n\ninterest in continued receipt of low cost housing).   Assuming that\n\nAppellants have a protected property interest in the form of an\n\nexpectation to remain in their public housing units, we do not\n\nbelieve that the process residents were afforded ran afoul of this\n\nconstitutional guarantee.\n\n          Appellants' interest in participating in the decision\n\nprocess regarding demolition of their public housing units is\n\nsignificant.   Undoubtedly, the residents' input is an important\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fcomponent in the development of an application for demolition and\n\ntheir comments assist the local housing authority in, for example,\n\nconsidering alternatives to demolition and assessing the impact\n\ndemolition will have on residents.              But the government also has a\n\nsignificant interest in preserving flexibility when evaluating\n\nwhether demolition of a public housing building is appropriate.\n\nThese   competing interests are adequately balanced and honored\n\nthrough a process in which residents are notified of the proposal\n\nfor   demolition    and    given   a   meaningful     opportunity     to    provide\n\ncomments that the housing authority can consider.\n\n            \"[P]rocedural due process is simply a guarantee of fair\n\nprocedure,\"      Amsden,   904     F.2d    at   753   (citation     and    internal\n\nquotations omitted), and in this case Appellants were put on notice\n\nof the PRPHA's decision to demolish; were afforded the opportunity\n\nto participate in a series of hearings and meetings where PRPHA\n\nofficials discussed the plans for demolition; and were given the\n\nopportunity to comment on the proposed demolition before the PRPHA\n\nfiled     its    application     for      demolition.        More   importantly,\n\nconsultation was done over the course of five years, a reasonable\n\ntime span that gave residents a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\n\nViewing    the   competing     interests     involved   in    a   public   housing\n\nauthority's decision to request authorization to demolish a public\n\nhousing building, we cannot say that Appellants were deprived of the\n\nminimum procedural constitutional guarantees to which they were\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fentitled.    Appellants were afforded a fair procedure that also met\n\nthe general statutory requirement of consultation.\n\n            As there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding\n\nthe PRPHA's compliance with resident consultation prior to filing\n\nan application for demolition with HUD, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's     decision    dismissing      Appellants'   claims     against     the\n\nCommonwealth defendants.\n\nC. APA Claim Against HUD\n\n            Appellants claim that HUD violated section 1437p(b) in\n\napproving the PRPHA's application for demolition. They contend that\n\nthe PRPHA developed its application for demolition without meeting\n\nthe resident consultation requirement, and that therefore HUD's\n\napproval of the application was unlawful. They also allege that the\n\nevidence included in the administrative record is insufficient to\n\nestablish that the PRPHA complied with the consultation requirement.\n\nThey argue that the only documents appended to the application for\n\ndemolition included the minutes of the February 22, 2005 meeting and\n\na newspaper announcement for the 2004 public hearing.\n\n            Our review of HUD's decision to approve the application\n\nfor demolition is governed by the highly deferential standard of\n\nreview set forth in section 706(2)(A) of the APA.                      5 U.S.C.\n\n§   706(2)(A).     We    may     only    disturb   HUD's    decision    if   the\n\nadministrative    record    as    a     whole   reveals    the   decision    was\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fwith law.\"       Id.     We presume HUD's decision is valid and may only\n\ndisturb it if there is no rational basis to support it.                  See River\n\nStreet Donuts, LLC v. Napolitano, 558 F.3d 111, 114 (1st Cir. 2009);\n\nConservation Law Found. of New England v. Sec'y of the Interior, 864\n\nF.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            Given our conclusion that the PRPHA's efforts to consult\n\nwith residents met the minimum procedural requirements of section\n\n1437p(b), we cannot hold that HUD's approval of the application was\n\narbitrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\n\nWe   acknowledge        that    the    PRPHA's   application    provided     scant\n\ndocumentation on consultation to support the agency's application\n\nfor demolition. We cannot conclude, however, that in relying on the\n\ndocuments that were included in the administrative record -- which\n\ninclude documents showing that PRPHA officers met with Las Gladiolas\n\nresidents    and       with    the   certified   residents'    council,    meeting\n\nnotices, sign-in sheets, and the minutes of the February 25th\n\nmeeting -- HUD acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\n\n            We    have    reviewed      the   administrative    record    and   are\n\nconvinced it shows that the PRPHA engaged in efforts to inform\n\nresidents of the proposed demolition and that the PRPHA procured and\n\nreceived comments from residents and the appropriate residents'\n\ncouncil.    We affirm the district court's dismissal of Appellants'\n\nclaim as to HUD.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fD. De facto Demolition Claim\n\n          Appellants' final claim on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing their claim that since the year 2001, the\n\nPRPHA failed to properly maintain Las Gladiolas in an effort to\n\nforce demolition of the project in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1437(p)\n\nand its accompanying regulations.15\n\n          The only evidence that Appellants offer to support their\n\nclaim   that   the   PRPHA   intentionally   rendered   Las   Gladiolas\n\nuninhabitable by failing to maintain the buildings in safe, decent,\n\nand sanitary conditions, is a sworn statement given by Aponte on\n\nJuly 6, 2007 which generally addresses the buildings' condition at\n\n\n15\n    Appellants ground their constructive demolition claim on a\nseries of cases that recognized a private right of action for\nconstructive demolition under a repealed version of section\n1437p(d), which required HUD approval before a public housing\nauthority could \"take any action to demolish or dispose of a public\nhousing project.\" United States Housing Act of 1937, amended by\nPub. Law No. 100-242, § 121(d), 101 Stat. 1815 (1988).       Courts\napplying the former § 1437p(d) framework held that neglect of a\ndevelopment could establish a de facto demolition claim.       See,\ne.g., Tinsley v. Kemp, 750 F. Supp. 1001 (W.D. Mo. 1990); Concerned\nTenants Ass'n of Father Panik Village v. Pierce, 685 F. Supp. 316,\n321 (D.Conn. 1988).      In 1998, the Quality Housing and Work\nResponsibility Act eliminated the requirement of prior HUD\nSecretary approval.    Pub. Law No. 105-276, § 531(a), 112 Stat.\n2461, 2570 (1998). However, the regulation that was in effect when\nthe PRPHA filed its application for demolition, 24 C.F.R. § 970.12,\n53 Fed. Reg. 30984 (1988) (repealed, October 24, 2006), stated that\na Public Housing Authority (PHA) may not take any action to\ndemolish a building without prior HUD approval. Similarly, the\ncurrent regulation, 24 C.F.R. § 970.25 (effective November 24,\n2006), requires a PHA to obtain HUD approval prior to taking any\naction to demolish a public housing unit.       We need not decide\nwhether a right of action for constructive demolition exists under\nthe applicable regulations. As the district court did, we assume\nthat such an enforceable right exists.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fand around 2007, one year after the application for demolition had\n\nbeen submitted to HUD.16   Some portions of the statement address the\n\nbuildings' condition prior to 2006, stating that Las Gladiolas had\n\nbeen deteriorating since 2001 and that prior to 2001, the apartments\n\nwere   allegedly   in   compliance   with   regulations   and   received\n\n\"satisfactory ratings on the annual inspections.\"         However, the\n\nstatement lacks specificity as to the extent of the deterioration,\n\nwhen it started, its causes, or whether the conditions existed at\n\nthe time the PRPHA filed its application with HUD.\n\n           In order to survive a motion for summary judgment, the\n\nnon-moving party \"must . . . set out specific facts showing a\n\n\n16\n     Aponte declared under oath the following:\n       The living conditions in Las Gladiolas are very far from\n       being sanitary and decent. Before 2001, when the process\n       of relocation started, all the apartments received\n       satisfactory ratings on the annual inspections. Since\n       2001 the condition of the 4 towers has deteriorated\n       rapidly. The vacated apartments are filled with debris,\n       dirty water, and old clothes left there by the previous\n       tenants. Overall, most apartments have broken sinks and\n       water filtrations [sic]. The complex is experimenting\n       [sic] an infestation of plagues that include rats,\n       cockroaches, mosquitoes and bees. There has been almost\n       no efforts to fumigate, only one, but it was only a few\n       apartments.    The handrails are rotting, there is a\n       deficient illumination of the premises (especially in\n       common areas) and the storage rooms on every floor are\n       filled with debris and dead animals. The parking area\n       has no illumination and the grass around it is not\n       trimmed as it should be. The sewers constantly overflow,\n       the recreation areas for the children are completely\n       abandoned and vandalized, and the basketball courts are\n       semi-painted [sic]. . . . Out of the ten (10) elevators\n       only two (2) are partially working. It is getting worse\n       and worse with the passing of time. It was not like this\n       before they decided to implode the complex.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fgenuine issue for trial.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).      \"With respect to\n\neach issue on which the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at\n\ntrial, that party must 'present definite, competent evidence to\n\nrebut the motion.'\"       Martínez-Rodríguez, 597 F.3d at 419 (citations\n\nomitted).     \"If   the    evidence    is    merely   colorable,   or   is   not\n\nsignificantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\" Anderson\n\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986) (citations\n\nomitted).    The non-moving party \"may not rest upon conclusory\n\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"\n\nVineberg v. Bissonnette, 548 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            Drawing all inferences in favor of Appellants, we can\n\nconclude that Aponte's statement details a series of conditions\n\nwhich show that proper maintenance was generally not provided at the\n\ntime the statement was made.          We can also conclude that after the\n\nPRPHA began to consider a plan for demolition in 2001, the buildings\n\ndeteriorated.   However, Aponte's statement does not specify which\n\nconditions existed prior to the PRPHA's application for demolition,\n\nnor does it state whether the PRPHA was made aware of the specific\n\nconditions, or whether the PRPHA purposefully declined to address\n\nthe conditions Aponte detailed in his statement.17\n\n\n17\n    In his deposition testimony, the Director of the PRPHA, Mr.\nCarlos Laboy-Díaz, recognized that as of 2007, the PRPHA had\nreceived complaints from residents regarding problems with the\nbuildings' elevators and water system and complaints regarding\nsecurity issues in Las Gladiolas. Mr. Laboy explained that the\n\n                                      -23-\n\f          Even   assuming,    without     deciding,   that    a   claim   for\n\nconstructive   demolition    is   available   in   these     circumstances,\n\nAponte's statement is insufficient to overcome summary judgment as\n\nit includes general allegations and lacks specificity regarding the\n\nconditions that existed in Las Gladiolas prior to the filing of the\n\nPRPHA's application for demolition.           Though conditions in Las\n\nGladiolas seemed to be far from ideal in 2007, Appellants have\n\nfailed to show that the Commonwealth           defendants' purposefully\n\ncreated and maintained these conditions in order to bring about a\n\nde facto demolition.\n\n           As Appellants have failed to produce evidence to show\n\nthat Las Gladiolas was rendered uninhabitable due to the PRPHA's\n\nintentional acts or inaction, we cannot hold that the district court\n\nerred in dismissing this claim.18\n\n\n\n\nPRPHA had expended funds to repair the elevators and to fix\nproblems with the water system. He also explained that in 2005,\nsecurity cameras were installed.\n18\n   Given that Appellants failed to shoulder the burden of showing\nthat a triable issue exists as to their de facto demolition claim,\nwe need not examine whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in admitting and considering the maintenance expense\nreports of Las Gladiolas submitted by the Commonwealth defendants\nwhich do not appear to have been properly authenticated as required\nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e). See Carmona v. Toledo,\n215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"To be admissible at the summary\njudgment stage, documents must be authenticated by and attached to\nan affidavit that meets the requirements of Rule 56(e).\" (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                   -24-\n\f                         IV. Conclusions\n\n          Because we find there are no genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to PRPHA's compliance with resident consultation prior to\n\nfiling an application for demolition with HUD, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision to dismiss Appellants' claim against the\n\nCommonwealth defendants and HUD.   We also affirm the dismissal of\n\nAppellants' de facto demolition claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -25-\n\f",

After careful consideration,\n\nwe affirm the district court's dismissal of Appellants' claims.\n\n                  I. Facts and Procedural Background\n\n             The Las Gladiolas project has two high-rise buildings\n\nthat house 676 apartment units.           On April 28, 2005, the PRPHA\n\nsubmitted its application to HUD for demolition of Las Gladiolas\n\nstating that structural tests revealed that the buildings were no\n\nlonger suited for public housing purposes and that no reasonable\n\nand   cost-effective   plan   for   repairs    or   \"modernization\"   was\n\nfeasible.3\n\n             Prior to submitting its application for demolition, the\n\nPRPHA held five public hearings to discuss its Annual Plans.          Each\n\nAnnual Plan included demolition of Las Gladiolas as one of the\n\nagency's objectives, and demolition of Las Gladiolas was discussed\n\nin each of the five annual hearings.          The hearings were held on\n\nApril 2, 2001, March 27, 2002, March 28, 2003, March 25, 2004, and\n\nMarch 30, 2005.    The hearings were announced in local newspapers.\n\nThe published notices included the dates and locations of the\n\n\n\n3\n    The primary statutory criteria for demolition of a public\nhousing project are: (i) that the project is obsolete as to\nphysical condition, location, or other factors, making it\nunsuitable for housing purposes; and (ii) no reasonable program of\nmodifications is cost-effective to return the public housing\nproject or portion of the project to useful life. 42 U.S.C. § 1437\np(a)(1)(A).     Appellants have not challenged the PRPHA's\ncertification that Las Gladiolas met the criteria for demolition.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhearings; provided directions to a location where residents could\n\nview the plans; and informed residents that transportation to the\n\nhearings would be provided.         Many Las Gladiolas residents attended\n\nthese public hearings and voiced their concerns.4\n\n           On February 22, 2005, the PRPHA held a two hour and\n\nforty-five minute meeting with Las Gladiolas I & II's residents'\n\ncouncil   and    Las   Gladiolas    residents      to   discuss,   among    other\n\nmatters, the proposed demolition.            After this meeting, the PRPHA\n\nformally filed its application for demolition of the housing\n\nproject   with   HUD.      HUD    approved   the   PRPHA's    application    for\n\ndemolition on February 2, 2006.\n\n           Following      HUD's     approval    of      the   application    for\n\ndemolition, Appellants filed a class action suit on behalf of all\n\nresidents of Las Gladiolas seeking to stop or delay the demolition\n\nof Las Gladiolas.       The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief against the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the\n\nSecretary of the Department of Housing of Puerto Rico; and the\n\nDirector of the PRPHA in their official capacities (collectively,\n\nCommonwealth defendants); and against three HUD officers in their\n\nofficial capacities, namely, the Secretary of HUD; HUD's Field\n\nOffice Director for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; and HUD's\n\nDirector of Public Housing for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n\n4\n     During a March 11, 2002 meeting with residents, the PRPHA's\nplans for demolition were discussed.    The minutes of this last\nmeeting, however, were not submitted to the district court.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fThe complaint alleged that Plaintiffs had been deprived of their\n\ndue process right to consultation and of their statutory right to\n\nconsultation as recognized in 42 U.S.C. § 1437p.         Appellants also\n\nbrought a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1437p and 24 C.F.R. § 970.12,\n\nasserting that through inaction and neglect, the Commonwealth\n\ndefendants had kept two of the four buildings at Las Gladiolas in\n\na state of disrepair that amounted to the de facto or constructive\n\ndemolition of those buildings.      As to HUD, the complaint claimed\n\nthat   the   agency's   approval   of    the   PRPHA's   application   for\n\ndemolition was illegal because the application was not developed in\n\nconsultation with residents as required by section 1437p.5\n\n             In due course, the Commonwealth defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment.    The HUD defendants filed a Motion In Support of\n\n[the] Commonwealth Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment arguing\n\nthat if the Commonwealth was found to have complied with the\n\nstatutory requirements for resident consultation, HUD's approval of\n\nthe application for demolition would also be in compliance with the\n\nregulations and therefore summary judgment should be granted in\n\nHUD's favor.\n\n             In December 2008, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in the Commonwealth defendants' favor, finding that the\n\n\n5\n    In November 2005, Aponte filed an administrative complaint\nbefore HUD challenging the alleged unlawful actions taken by the\nCommonwealth defendants and requesting HUD's intervention. At the\ntime the briefs were filed in this case, HUD had not officially\nresponded to Aponte's administrative complaint.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fPRPHA had complied with the resident consultation requirement as\n\nprescribed in section 1437p and that Appellants had failed to show\n\nthat there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the\n\nCommonwealth defendants had failed to maintain Las Gladiolas.\n\nApproximately     one    month    later,      the   district   court     dismissed\n\nAppellants' claims against HUD, finding that HUD \"did not act\n\nunlawfully   in   approving       the     demolition.\"     Aponte-Rosario       v.\n\nAcevedo-Vilá, No. 06-1578, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. Jan. 29, 2009).\n\nAppellants   filed      this   timely     appeal    challenging    the   district\n\ncourt's dismissal of their claims.\n\n          II. Preliminary Issues and Standard of Review\n\nA. Appellants' Right of Action Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 5 U.S.C.\n§ 702\n          Appellants' main claim on appeal is that they were\n\ndeprived of their right to consultation as recognized in section\n\n1437p of the United States Housing Act.                   Appellants asserted\n\njurisdiction    for     the    resident    consultation    claim    against   the\n\nCommonwealth defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and against HUD\n\nunder section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 702.\n\n          The district court did not consider whether section 1437p\n\nprovides Appellants a right enforceable under section 1983 and the\n\nparties did not raise the question on appeal.6                 While we harbor\n\n\n6\n   The issue, however, was raised by this court at oral argument\nand the parties filed supplemental letters under Rule 28j\ndiscussing whether a private right of action exists.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdoubts as to whether section 1473p confers upon Appellants a\n\nprivate right of action, and at least one circuit has held that\n\nresidents   of   a   public   housing    complex   do   not    have   such    an\n\nunambiguous and \"privately enforceable federal right to prevent the\n\ndemolition of their housing developments,\" Anderson v.

Discussion\n\nA. Resident Consultation Claim Against the Commonwealth Defendants\n\n           Appellants challenge the adequacy and sufficiency of the\n\nprocedures employed by the PRPHA to consult with residents.                They\n\ncontend that neither the annual hearings held by the PRPHA nor the\n\nFebruary 25, 2005 meeting with Las Gladiolas residents satisfied\n\nthe statutory requirement of consultation.         Appellants argue that\n\nthe   notices   that   announced   both   the   annual   hearings    and    the\n\nFebruary 25th meeting were inadequate because they did not specify\n\nthat demolition of Las Gladiolas was to be discussed.               They also\n\nclaim that residents were not afforded a meaningful opportunity to\n\nbe heard because the annual meetings covered a panoply of issues\n\napart from demolition, and the final meeting with residents was\n\nheld just a few months prior to the filing of the application for\n\ndemolition and other topics like relocation were discussed.\n\n           Section 1437p governs demolition of a public housing\n\nproject and provides that the Secretary of HUD shall not approve an\n\napplication for demolition unless certain conditions are met. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437p.    Section 1437p(b) provides that\n\n           [t]he    Secretary   shall    disapprove    an\n           application [for demolition] if the Secretary\n           determines that . . . (2) the application was\n           not developed in consultation with (A)\n           residents who will be affected by the proposed\n           demolition or disposition; (B) each resident\n\n                                   -11-\n\f          advisory board and resident council, if any,\n          of the project (or portion thereof) that will\n          be affected by the proposed demolition or\n          disposition; and (C) appropriate government\n          officials.\n\n(emphasis added).8 The statute does not define \"consultation,\" and\n\nit does not provide specific requirements as to what type of notice\n\nmust be given, how many times consultation must occur, how many\n\nresidents must be present when demolition is discussed, or what\n\nopportunities residents must be provided to voice their opinions as\n\nto demolition before the local housing authority may be deemed to\n\nhave satisfied the general consultation requirement.\n\n          Following the general guidelines set forth by section\n\n1437p, the PRPHA held five public hearings from 2001 to 2005 to\n\ndiscuss the PRPHA's Annual Plans.     The Annual Plans of those five\n\nyears indicated that there was a planned application for demolition\n\nof Las Gladiolas and included a time line for the anticipated start\n\nand end dates for demolition. Las Gladiolas residents were present\n\nat these annual hearings9 and voiced their concerns regarding the\n\n\n8\n   The regulation that was in effect when the PRPHA submitted its\napplication for demolition provided that the public housing\nauthority's application for demolition should include \"[a]\ndescription of the PHA's consultations with tenants and any tenant\norganizations . . . with copies of any written comments which may\nhave been submitted to the PHA and the PHA's evaluation of the\ncomments.\" 24 C.F.R. § 970.8 (2005).\n9\n  Approximately eighty Las Gladiolas residents attended the April\n2001 hearing; twenty-nine residents attended the March 2002\nhearing; thirty-one residents attended the March 2003 hearing; one\nresident attended the March 2004 hearing; and six residents\nattended the March 2005 hearing.\n\n                               -12-\n\fPRPHA's plan for demolition.         For example, Aponte voiced his\n\nopposition to the demolition on at least three of the hearings.10\n\n          Besides holding annual hearings in each of the five years\n\nprior to the filing of the PRPHA's application for demolition,\n\nPRPHA officials met with members of Las Gladiolas residents'\n\ncouncil on October 18, 2001. Among other issues, they discussed an\n\nimplosion update for Las Gladiolas.          An additional and final\n\nmeeting specifically for Las Gladiolas residents was held on\n\nFebruary 22, 2005 to discuss \"important matters for the benefit of\n\nthe community.\"   The attendance sheet shows that approximately 170\n\nLas Gladiolas residents attended this meeting to discuss relocation\n\nconcerns, the possibility of the building's rehabilitation, and\n\nissues regarding demolition.       Although the meeting's minutes show\n\nthat relocation was the residents' principal concern, they also\n\nreveal that residents, including Aponte, were able to express their\n\nconcerns as to why the PRPHA had opted for demolition.11\n\n          We   note   that   the   PRPHA's   efforts   to   consult   with\n\nresidents were by no means ideal or extensive.         For example, the\n\npublished notices for both the annual hearings and the February\n\n\n\n10\n   Aponte testified at the April 2, 2001, March 27, 2002, and March\n28, 2003 hearings and stated his opposition to the proposed\ndemolition.   He also acknowledged that some residents favored\ndemolition.\n11\n   The minutes show that Aponte questioned the agency's explanation\nthat rehabilitation or remodeling was not feasible due to budgetary\nconstraints.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f22nd meeting did not indicate that demolition of Las Gladiolas was\n\nto be discussed, and there is no indication in the record that the\n\nPRPHA informed residents in any other manner that demolition would\n\nbe discussed in the annual hearings.          Cf. Anderson, 556 F.3d at 360\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in district court's denial of\n\npreliminary injunction where the record showed that the local\n\nhousing authority notified residents by mail of a meeting on the\n\nproposed   demolition   which       residents      attended    and   where   an\n\nadditional meeting was held with resident leaders to discuss\n\ndemolition); Project B.A.S.I.C. v.

We find that this is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the consultation requirement set forth in\n\nsection 1437p(b).14\n\n\n12\n   In his testimony at the 2002 annual hearing, Aponte explained\nthat a group of residents requested and was granted a meeting with\nthe Secretary of the Department of Housing of the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico, Ileana Echegoyen, to discuss demolition.\n13\n    The record shows that residents voiced their opposition to\ndemolition before a legislative committee and they also enlisted\nthe help of the School of Social Work of the University of Puerto\nRico in submitting alternative proposals to the PRPHA. The PRPHA\nalso established a support center that provided information and\ncounseling on demolition and relocation. However, the record does\nnot reveal whether the center was established prior to the filing\nof the PRPHA's application for demolition.\n14\n   Appellants argue there is a genuine issue of material fact as\nto whether the PRPHA consulted with the resident organization Las\nGladiolas Vive. Appellants, however, have not offered any evidence\n\n                                 -15-\n\fB. Due Process Claim\n\n           Appellants also claim that their rights to constitutional\n\nprocedural due process were infringed.              Appellants due process\n\nargument is inextricably bound to their contention that the PRPHA\n\ndid not develop its application in consultation with Las Gladiolas\n\nresidents.       They     concede   that     the    statutory        consultation\n\nrequirement complies with the minimum due process guarantees, but\n\ncontend that these procedural guarantees were not afforded in this\n\ncase.\n\n           The   threshold    question       in   any   claim      for   denial   of\n\nprocedural due process is whether plaintiffs were deprived of a\n\nliberty   or   property    interest    protected        by   the   United   States\n\nConstitution.

Assuming that\n\nAppellants have a protected property interest in the form of an\n\nexpectation to remain in their public housing units, we do not\n\nbelieve that the process residents were afforded ran afoul of this\n\nconstitutional guarantee.\n\n          Appellants' interest in participating in the decision\n\nprocess regarding demolition of their public housing units is\n\nsignificant.

But the government also has a\n\nsignificant interest in preserving flexibility when evaluating\n\nwhether demolition of a public housing building is appropriate.\n\nThese   competing interests are adequately balanced and honored\n\nthrough a process in which residents are notified of the proposal\n\nfor   demolition    and    given   a   meaningful     opportunity     to    provide\n\ncomments that the housing authority can consider.\n\n            \"[P]rocedural due process is simply a guarantee of fair\n\nprocedure,\"      Amsden,   904     F.2d    at   753   (citation     and    internal\n\nquotations omitted), and in this case Appellants were put on notice\n\nof the PRPHA's decision to demolish; were afforded the opportunity\n\nto participate in a series of hearings and meetings where PRPHA\n\nofficials discussed the plans for demolition; and were given the\n\nopportunity to comment on the proposed demolition before the PRPHA\n\nfiled     its    application     for      demolition.

APA Claim Against HUD\n\n            Appellants claim that HUD violated section 1437p(b) in\n\napproving the PRPHA's application for demolition. They contend that\n\nthe PRPHA developed its application for demolition without meeting\n\nthe resident consultation requirement, and that therefore HUD's\n\napproval of the application was unlawful. They also allege that the\n\nevidence included in the administrative record is insufficient to\n\nestablish that the PRPHA complied with the consultation requirement.\n\nThey argue that the only documents appended to the application for\n\ndemolition included the minutes of the February 22, 2005 meeting and\n\na newspaper announcement for the 2004 public hearing.\n\n            Our review of HUD's decision to approve the application\n\nfor demolition is governed by the highly deferential standard of\n\nreview set forth in section 706(2)(A) of the APA.                      5 U.S.C.\n\n§   706(2)(A).

However, the regulation that was in effect when\nthe PRPHA filed its application for demolition, 24 C.F.R. § 970.12,\n53 Fed. Reg. 30984 (1988) (repealed, October 24, 2006), stated that\na Public Housing Authority (PHA) may not take any action to\ndemolish a building without prior HUD approval. Similarly, the\ncurrent regulation, 24 C.F.R. § 970.25 (effective November 24,\n2006), requires a PHA to obtain HUD approval prior to taking any\naction to demolish a public housing unit.       We need not decide\nwhether a right of action for constructive demolition exists under\nthe applicable regulations.
