This  is an  appeal from  a district\n                     \n\ncourt order refusing to reopen a judgment entered pursuant to\n\na  settlement agreement.    Appellants, Valerie  and  Richard\n\nBrayall, filed their motion to reopen almost two years  after\n                                                      \n\nthe settlement order of dismissal.  \n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          The Brayalls, former Tupperware distributors, filed\n\nan action in May 1987 in Massachusetts superior court against\n\nappellees, Dart Industries  and various individuals (\"Dart\").\n\nThe complaint contained charges  that Dart had violated RICO.\n\nEssentially,   the   Brayalls   were   unhappy   with   their\n\ndistributorship,  claiming that  they were  misled as  to how\n\nmuch money they would earn.  As a result of  the RICO claims,\n\nDart removed the action to the Massachusetts federal district\n\ncourt.   The district court then remanded the state claims to\n\nstate court.\n\n          On August  30, 1989, the attorney  for the Brayalls\n\nsent a letter  to the  district court informing  it that  the\n\nRICO  claim had  been settled.   The  letter stated  that the\n\nparties  had  reached  an   agreement  \"in  principle\"  which\n\nincluded the  dismissal of  the RICO claim  \"with prejudice.\"\n\nThe letter went on to provide that the parties \"shall soon be\n\nfiling  the required paperwork.\"   Accordingly,  the district\n\ncourt  issued, on  August  31, 1989,  a  settlement order  of\n\ndismissal.   The  order provided  for the  dismissal \"without\n\n                             -2-\n\nprejudice to the  right of  any party upon  good cause  shown\n\nwithin 60 days,  to reopen  the action if  settlement is  not\n\nconsummated.\"  Nothing happened until  May 20, 1991, when the\n\nBrayalls, now appearing pro se, filed their motion to reopen.\n\n          As support for this motion, they argued that (1) no\n\n\"settlement papers or signed  agreements\" had been filed with\n\nthe  court;  (2)  a  \"suggestion   of  bankruptcy,\"  although\n\ndocketed  on February  20, 1990,  should have operated  as an\n\nautomatic stay of  the RICO  action; (3)  their attorney  had\n\nresigned  before the 60-day  period had ended;  (4) they were\n\nforced into bankruptcy due to the cost of the litigation; (5)\n\nevidence  was withheld  concerning  the RICO  claim; and  (6)\n\nthere existed \"overwhelming evidence\" of mail and wire fraud.\n\n          Dart opposed  this motion and moved  to enforce the\n\nsettlement.   Attached to  Dart's motion  was a letter  dated\n\nAugust  28, 1989, sent  by the Brayalls'  attorney to counsel\n\nfor Dart.  This  letter set forth  the specific terms of  the\n\nagreement; it not only  affirmed that the RICO action  was to\n\nbe dismissed  but also  detailed the financial  terms of  the\n\nsettlement  of  a  collection  action (also  pending  in  the\n\ndistrict court) initiated by Dart against the Brayalls.\n\n          In further support of  its opposition to the motion\n\nto  reopen,  Dart submitted  an  affidavit  of the  Brayalls'\n\nattorney filed in state court in which he stated:\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Agreements  were reached  to  settle  the  two\n     Federal Court  litigations in August of  1989.  The\n     terms were set  out in letter form and  the Federal\n     Court was notified.  However, the Brayalls withdrew\n     their  approval  of   the  settlements  before  the\n     confirmatory paperwork was  prepared and  executed.\n     The  Brayalls also discharged me, after I indicated\n     that I was not willing to renege on the agreements.\n\nAlso attached to Dart's  opposition was a letter sent  by the\n\nBrayalls  to a superior court  judge.  In  it, they indicated\n\nthat they had  agreed to  the settlement so  that they  could\n\nproceed to trial in the state case. \n\n          The  Brayalls  filed an  answer  to  the motion  to\n\nenforce  the settlement in which they  argued, in addition to\n\nthe claims in their motion to reopen, that their attorney had\n\nfailed to notify  the district  court that the  terms of  the\n\nsettlement  had   not  been  fully  agreed   upon,  that  the\n\nsettlement agreement  was unfair, that they  had settled only\n\nbecause they were facing bankruptcy, that Dart had refused to\n\nengage  in discovery  and that  the Brayalls  had not  waived\n\ntheir right to reopen the case.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          \"The decision to grant or deny a motion  for relief\n\nfrom a final judgment is committed to the sound discretion of\n\nthe  trial court.\"   United States v.  Boch Oldsmobile, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n909 F.2d 657, 660 (1st Cir. 1990).  Thus, we will reverse the\n\ndistrict court's decision only  upon a demonstration of abuse\n\nof  discretion.    Id.    Where  litigants  have  voluntarily\n                     \n\ndetermined  not to  pursue  their claims,  the party  seeking\n\n                             -4-\n\nrelief bears an especially heavy burden  to show the presence\n\nof  \"extraordinary circumstances.\"   Id.   The considerations\n                                       \n\nrelevant to  our inquiry on  appeal are whether  the Brayalls\n\ncan  show  a good  reason for  not  taking action  sooner and\n\nwhether Dart has  been prejudiced by the  delay.  See  id. at\n                                                         \n\n661.\n\n          The  reasons   stated  by   the  Brayalls   do  not\n\nadequately  explain the length  of time between  the order of\n\ndismissal and the filing of the motion to reopen.  It appears\n\nthat within the 60-day  period they had in fact  decided that\n\nthey  did  not  wish to  settle.    In  his affidavit,  their\n\nattorney  states that  they  withdrew their  approval of  the\n\nsettlement terms and, as a result, discharged him.   Further,\n\naccording  to  the  Brayalls  themselves,   their  attorney's\n\n\"resignation\" occurred before the  expiration of the 60 days.\n\nThus, it appears that the Brayalls were in a position to file\n\na motion to reopen within the time  limit set by the district\n\ncourt or at  least very  shortly thereafter.   Yet two  years\n\nelapsed before they did so.\n\n          Even if we disregarded the remarkable length of the\n\ndelay, it is impossible to discern from the Brayalls' filings\n\nany substantial  basis to  justify undoing a  final judgment.\n\nReferences to  exhaustion,  duress and  coercion abound,  but\n\nthere is no coherent account of facts to support such claims.\n\nIt  may well  be that  the expense  and burden  of litigation\n\n                             -5-\n\nimpelled the  Brayalls to countenance a  settlement, but that\n\nis part of many settlement equations and no basis for setting\n\none aside.   Nor is the strength of their  claims a basis for\n\nreopening or else no such dismissal would ever be final.\n\n          The Brayalls argue that there was no meeting of the\n\nminds as to their  settlement and that no signed  papers were\n\never filed.  This  argument misses the essential point:   the\n\nBrayalls  are  attacking a  judgment  dismissing  their case.\n                                    \n\nHaving discharged  their  attorney and  taken the  litigation\n\ninto  their own hands, it was their responsibility to file in\n\nthe district  court promptly if the  settlement collapsed and\n\nthey wished  to reopen.   They did not  do so and,  absent an\n\nextraordinary  excuse for  the lengthy lapse,  may not  do so\n\nnow.\n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment  of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed. \n                          \n\n                             -6-\n",

Nor is the strength of their  claims a basis for\n\nreopening or else no such dismissal would ever be final.\n\n          The Brayalls argue that there was no meeting of the\n\nminds as to their  settlement and that no signed  papers were\n\never filed.  This  argument misses the essential point:   the\n\nBrayalls  are  attacking a  judgment  dismissing  their case.\n                                    \n\nHaving discharged  their  attorney and  taken the  litigation\n\ninto  their own hands, it was their responsibility to file in\n\nthe district  court promptly if the  settlement collapsed and\n\nthey wished  to reopen.   They did not  do so and,  absent an\n\nextraordinary  excuse for  the lengthy lapse,  may not  do so\n\nnow.\n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment  of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed. \n                          \n\n                             -6-\n</pre>",
