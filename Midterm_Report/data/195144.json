In  these  consolidated\n                                \n\nappeals, petitioner  Tesfaye  Gebremichael  claims  that  the\n\nBoard of  Immigration Appeals  (the  Board or  BIA) erred  in\n\nfinding   him   ineligible   for   asylum,   withholding   of\n\ndeportation, and suspension of deportation.  See 8  U.S.C.   \n                                                \n\n1158(a),  1253(h),  and  1254(a)  (1988  &amp;  Supp.  IV  1992).\n\nPetitioner's  principal argument is  that he is  eligible for\n\nasylum as a result of  the detention and torture visited upon\n\nhim as a  means of persecuting his brother.   Petitioner also\n\nraises the vexing procedural issue of when the Board can take\n\n\"official  notice\" of  country  conditions without  giving an\n\nalien warning or a predecision opportunity to respond.  After\n\na  careful review,  we hold  that  petitioner is  statutorily\n\neligible for asylum  and that he is entitled  to a meaningful\n\nopportunity to respond  to extra-record facts noticed  by the\n\nBoard. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                         BACKGROUND1\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          Petitioner is an Ethiopian alien of Amhara descent.\n\nHe was born in 1960 in Addis Ababa, where some family members\n\ncontinue  to live.   In  his early  years he lived  under the\n\nshadow of the repressive Mengistu regime, although he himself\n\n                    \n\n1.  Since  neither  the  underlying  facts  nor  petitioner's\ncredibility are in dispute, we lay out the facts as described\nby petitioner's testimony and other information in the record\nsubmitted by him.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nnever  suffered physical  harm or  a  deprivation of  liberty\n\nuntil he  was older.2   Petitioner was allowed to  finish his\n\neducation.   In 1981, he received an  engineering degree from\n\nthe  University of Addis Ababa and was ordered to work at the\n\nEthiopian Construction Authority.  \n\n          In   September  1982,   the  military   authorities\n\narrested petitioner's father and younger brother as they were\n\nparticipating  in a  Seventh Day  Adventist service.3   It is\n\nundisputed  that  the  father  and brother  were  persecuted,\n\nalthough  it  is  unclear  whether  they  suffered  religious\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under the feudal regime  of Haile Selassie,  petitioner's\nfamily was the wealthy owner of several businesses.   Shortly\nafter  a revolution in  1974, the Dergue,  headed by Mengistu\nHaile Mariam, took  power and imposed a Marxist  regime.  The\nDergue carried out a campaign of repression that included the\nidentification  of individuals who had been among the wealthy\nclass under the  former government,  repression of  religious\nand political opposition activity, and extensive surveillance\nof civilians by local committees.  The Dergue confiscated the\nproperty  of  petitioner's  family.     Petitioner,  who  was\nfourteen  years  old  at  the  time,  became  active   in  an\nopposition organization,  although the Dergue  was apparently\nnot aware of  his political activity, if at  all, until after\nhe left the country.  In the \"Red Terror\" of 1976, the Dergue\nheightened its  repressive activity and killed many suspected\nopponents, frequently targeting families -- many of whom were\nAmhara  -- who  had enjoyed  a privileged status  under Haile\nSelassie.   Petitioner does not  claim that he or  his family\nfell victim to the Red Terror.\n\n3.  While the rest of petitioner's  immediate family remained\nmembers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, petitioner's father\nand  younger brother became Seventh Day Adventists just after\nthe revolution.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\npersecution, political persecution,  or both.4  In  any case,\n\npetitioner's  father was imprisoned for over two years before\n\nhe  was released.   Petitioner's brother was  also imprisoned\n\nbut, following his transfer to a hospital in January 1983, he\n\nmanaged to escape to the family home.  Petitioner then helped\n\n\"smuggle\" his brother out of the country.5\n\n          Shortly thereafter  petitioner was arrested  by the\n\nDergue.  Although  the authorities did not have  -- and never\n\nobtained  --  any  information  linking   petitioner  to  his\n\nbrother's escape, petitioner was accused of aiding the escape\n\nof  an  enemy of  the  state.   Petitioner was  taken  to the\n\nCentral  Investigation  Center,  controlled   by  the  agency\n\nresponsible for  investigating anti-revolutionary  activities\n\nand opposition  to the government.   Every day for  two weeks\n\nDergue personnel interrogated and tortured petitioner as they\n\ntried  to force him  to reveal  his brother's  hiding place.6\n\n                    \n\n4.  According  to petitioner,  in an  attempt  to coerce  his\nfather  and brother into  renouncing their religious beliefs,\nthe Dergue accused  them of \"using  the name of  God and  the\nchurch  to propagate false  information against the  state by\nworking  together with  foreign  Interventionists (i.e.,  the\nCIA) who sought to overthrow  the government.\"  To the extent\nthat  the Dergue imputed pro-Western political beliefs to the\nfather  and  brother,  they   may  have  suffered   political\npersecution.\n\n5.  The  brother has since  been granted political  asylum in\nthe United States.\n\n6.  Petitioner described his experience as follows:\n\n          Each day, I  would be taken from  my cell\n          to a  room where the  interrogations took\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nPetitioner was then  held for an additional three  and a half\n\nmonths  in a  different section  of the  Center.   He  was no\n\nlonger interrogated but  was occasionally forced to  crawl on\n\nsharp stones.   In  late June  1983, petitioner  was released\n\nafter the  Dergue  learned  that  his brother  had  left  the\n\ncountry.  Upon release he was threatened with execution if he\n\nwere  to  engage  in any  political  or  religious activities\n\ndisfavored by  the government.   There is little  evidence in\n\n                    \n\n          place.   There, two men  with masks  over\n          their heads would beat me on the soles of\n          my feet [and] then they would call in the\n          political cadre, who demanded information\n          about my brother.   I always said  that I\n          knew  nothing  about his  whereabouts  or\n          this escape.   The political  cadre would\n          then  order  the  other  men  to  inflict\n          various tortures on me  before I would be\n          subjected to the next round of questions.\n          Sometimes they would push my  head into a\n          tank of  filthy water until I nearly lost\n          consciousness.  Then they would let me up\n          and  I would  be  questioned  again.   At\n          other times  they would threaten  to kill\n          me and then  enact a mock execution.   In\n          still  another  method  used  to make  me\n          talk, they would throw me  onto the floor\n          of  a dark cell  and kick me  all over my\n          body, including my head and genitals.  On\n          other occasions  I would just  be beaten,\n          and  frequently I was made to crawl on my\n          knees over  sharp stones for a  half hour\n          at a  time.   In  all, the  interrogation\n          sessions  usually   lasted  approximately\n          three  hours, at the end of which I could\n          be physically thrown or kicked back  into\n          my cell.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthe  record  that  petitioner   was  ever  formally  charged,\n\nprosecuted, or convicted.7  \n\n          Fearing  additional  mistreatment   if  the  Dergue\n\nlearned  of his  role  in  his brother's  escape  or his  own\n\nopposition  political activities,  petitioner  made plans  to\n\nleave  the country.   He  obtained an  illegal  passport and,\n\nthrough UNESCO,  secured a  student visa  and scholarship  to\n\nattend graduate school in Sierra  Leone.  He left Ethiopia in\n\nOctober 1983.\n\n          After   completing  his   studies  in   June  1985,\n\npetitioner  still  feared  persecution  should  he  return to\n\nEthiopia but  believed he would  not be allowed to  remain in\n\nSierra Leone.  While it  is not clear when petitioner decided\n\nto  attempt to  stay in  the United  States, he  entered this\n\ncountry on June  23, 1985, with a six  month visitor's visa.8\n\nPetitioner applied for asylum on December 12, 1985.\n\n          At  a   deportation  hearing   later  that   month,\n\npetitioner conceded  deportability but moved  for three forms\n\nof  relief  from   deportation  under  the   Immigration  and\n\n                    \n\n7.  We   note  again  that  the  immigration  judge  did  not\ndiscredit petitioner's  testimony, which was  corroborated to\nan  extent by  a physical  examination  of petitioner  (which\nshowed permanent scars on his knees) as well as evidence from\nthe   State  Department   and   human  rights   organizations\ndescribing the Dergue's typical torture techniques.\n\n8.  Petitioner's brother was  living in the United  States at\nthe time.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nNationality  Act  (INA):  political asylum,9  withholding  of\n\ndeportation10  and  voluntary  departure.11     8  U.S.C.    \n\n1158(a), 1253(h), and 1254(e) (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992).  The IJ\n\ngranted  petitioner's  request  for voluntary  departure  but\n\ndenied  the other two applications.  Petitioner then appealed\n\nto  the Board,  which received  briefs in  November  1989 and\n\nheard oral argument in March 1990.  The Board did not issue a\n\ndecision until two years had passed.\n\n                    \n\n9.  Under  8 U.S.C.    1158(a)  the  Attorney General  (whose\nauthority  in these  matters  is delegated  to the  INS, with\nreview by the Board) has the discretion to grant asylum to an\nalien who  qualifies as a  \"refugee\" within the meaning  of 8\nU.S.C.    1101(a)(42)(A) (1988).   In relevant  part, section\n1101(a)(42)(A) defines \"refugee\" as\n\n          any  person who is outside any country of\n          such person's nationality  . . . and  who\n          is unable  or unwilling to return to, and\n          is unable  or unwilling to  avail himself\n          or  herself of  the  protection of,  that\n          country because of persecution or a well-\n          founded fear of persecution on account of\n          race,  religion, nationality,  membership\n          in   a   particular  social   group,   or\n          political opinion.\n\n10.  8  U.S.C.    1253(h)(1)  provides  that \"[t]he  Attorney\nGeneral shall  not deport  or return  any alien  . .  . to  a\ncountry  if the Attorney General determines that such alien's\nlife or  freedom  would  be threatened  in  such  country  on\naccount  of  race,  religion,  nationality, membership  in  a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\n\n11.  8  U.S.C.     1254(e)(1)   gives  the  Attorney  General\ndiscretion to \"permit any alien under deportation proceedings\n. . . to depart voluntarily from the United States at his own\nexpense in lieu of deportation if such alien  shall establish\nto the satisfaction  of the Attorney General that  he is, and\nhas  been, a person of good moral character for at least five\nyears  immediately preceding  his  application for  voluntary\ndeparture.\"\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          In the intervening time, conditions in Ethiopia had\n\nchanged drastically.  Mengistu fled  the country in May 1991,\n\nthe   Dergue  was  quickly   dismantled,  and   a  multiparty\n\ntransitional   government   was   established   to   organize\n\ndemocratic elections.   The transitional  government declared\n\nthat citizens in exile were welcome to return.\n\n          In  its decision on  March 25, 1992,  the Board not\n\nonly reviewed the  record de novo but also  looked beyond the\n                                 \n\nrecord to take administrative notice of the political changes\n\nin Ethiopia as  described in a state department  report.  The\n\nBoard did  not inform petitioner  of its intention  to notice\n\nthese facts,  nor did it  give  petitioner an  opportunity to\n\nrespond.    Although  it  extended  the  time  for  voluntary\n\ndeparture,  the   Board  affirmed   the  IJ's   finding  that\n\npetitioner  was not eligible for either asylum or withholding\n\nof deportation.\n\n          The Board  found petitioner  ineligible for  asylum\n\nfor  failure  to prove  either  past persecution  or  a well-\n\nfounded  fear of future persecution.  The Board reasoned that\n\npetitioner had not shown  that the \"reprehensible\"  detention\n\nand torture inflicted  on him in 1983 were \"to punish him for\n\none of the five grounds specified in the [INA] rather than to\n\ncompel him to reveal the whereabouts of his missing brother.\"\n\nIn re  Gebremichael, No. A26876916,  slip op. at 3  (BIA Mar.\n                   \n\n25,  1992)  (Gebremichael  I).

Relying  on\n\naffidavits and  background material, petitioner  claimed that\n\npersecution was once again part of the currency  of political\n\nconflict in Ethiopia.  There was evidence that the multiparty\n\ncoalition that  ousted Mengistu  had fractured  and that  the\n\ngovernment was  dominated by  Marxist members  of the  Tigray\n\nethnic group who  were increasingly  intolerant of  political\n\nand ethnic differences.  There was also evidence that, should\n\nhe  return to  Ethiopia,  petitioner could  face  persecution\n\nbased  on  his Amhara  ethnicity,14  his family's  privileged\n\nsocial  status before the 1974 revolution, and his expatriate\n\npolitical activity in opposition to the new government.\n\n          As  part of  his motion  for rehearing,  petitioner\n\nalso moved to reopen so that he could apply for suspension of\n\ndeportation on the ground that repatriation  would constitute\n\n\"extreme hardship\" to  him.

We note in passing that one federal court recently found\nthat  \"the Amharan people are now  the subject of persecution\nby the Tigrean  government that is in power  in Addis Ababa,\"\nand that  an Ethiopian alien  of Amhara descent had  raised a\n\"well-founded  fear  of  persecution.\"    United   States  v.\n                                                         \nDagnachew, 808 F.

The Board then reaffirmed its finding\n\nthat petitioner was  ineligible for asylum or  withholding of\n\ndeportation.\n\n          Finally, the Board found that petitioner  failed to\n\npresent prima facie evidence of \"extreme hardship\" sufficient\n                   \n\n                    \n\n15.

Getachew  and Yosef live\nwith petitioner, although there is no  evidence that they are\ncurrently dependent  on him.

Where  the  agency  denies a  motion  to  reopen  or\nreconsider   by   making   a   determination   of   statutory\neligibility,  that   determination  must   be  supported   by\nsubstantial evidence.

The\n\nBoard  did not find  that the harm  inflicted upon petitioner\n\nwas too mild to  constitute persecution.  Instead, the  Board\n\nessentially held that petitioner was merely a vehicle for the\n\npersecution   of  his   brother  and   not   the  victim   of\n\n\"persecution\"  within the  meaning  of the  INA.   The  Board\n\nreasonably found  that the Dergue did not  detain and torture\n\npetitioner because of his own  actual or imputed political or\n\nreligious beliefs.    Nonetheless,  however  reasonable  this\n\nfinding,  it does not  dispose of petitioner's  asylum claim.\n\nPetitioner argues --  and we agree -- that  he was persecuted\n\nfor other reasons equally cognizable under the INA. \n         \n\n          Petitioner's  strongest argument  is  that he  is a\n\nrefugee  because  he   was  mistreated  on  account   of  his\n\nrelationship  to his  brother.19   While  most asylum  claims\n\n                    \n\n19.

In  addition,  petitioner\nclaims that he is eligible for asylum based on a well-founded\nfear  that he  will face  future persecution  in Ethiopia  on\naccount  of his ethnicity, social status and political views.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ninvolve  other  types  of persecution,  the  INA  also offers\n\nrefugee status to victims of \"persecution on account of . . .\n\nmembership  in  a  particular  social  group.\"    8  U.S.C.  \n\n1101(a)(42)(A).20   An  applicant  qualifies as  a  \"refugee\"\n\nunder the INA if membership in a social group is \"at the root\n\nof  persecution,\"  such  that membership  itself  generates a\n\n\"specific threat to the  [applicant].\"  Ananeh-Firempong, 766\n                                                        \n\nF.2d   at   626-27   (citation   and   quotation    omitted).\n\nAccordingly,   we  must  determine  whether  a  family  is  a\n\ncognizable  \"social group\" within the meaning of the INA and,\n\nif  so, whether  petitioner's torture  and  detention by  the\n\nauthorities can be traced to his family membership.\n\n          In  laying out  general  principles governing  this\n\ntype of persecution, the Board has stated that\n\n                    \n\nIn light  of our  holding below that  petitioner is  a social\nrefugee based on  past persecution, we  do not address  these\nother theories.\n\n20.

In the\n\ncase  on appeal,  the  link  between  family  membership  and\n\npersecution is manifest:  as the record  makes clear and  the\n\nINS itself concedes, the Ethiopian security forces applied to\n\npetitioner the  \"time-honored theory  of cherchez  la famille\n                                                             \n\n(`look for  the family'),\"  the terrorization  of one  family\n\nmember to extract  information about the location  of another\n\nfamily member or  to force the missing family  member to come\n\nforward.  As  a result, we are compelled  to conclude that no\n\nreasonable  factfinder could fail to find that petitioner was\n\nsingled out for  mistreatment because of his  relationship to\n\nhis  brother.    Thus,  this  is  a  clear  case  of  \"[past]\n\npersecution on  account of .  . . membership in  a particular\n\nsocial group.\"  8  U.S.C.   1101(a)(42)(A).  Accordingly,  we\n\nmust determine what relief, if any, is necessary.\n\n          Remand  will  not always  be  appropriate when  the\n\nBoard has  erred in determining eligibility for discretionary\n\nrelief from  deportation.

In  this case, however,  the Board  has not\n\nclearly stated that it  would deny asylum if  petitioner were\n\neligible.   Quite the  contrary, the Board  has asserted that\n\n\"[b]ecause  we have  found  that  the  respondent  failed  to\n\nestablish his statutory  eligibility for asylum, we  need not\n\naddress whether he merits that form of relief in the exercise\n\nof  discretion.\"     Gebremichael   I,  slip   op.  at   3.22\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n22.

Nonetheless, compelling  circumstances\n \nappears to be an  alternative basis for granting asylum,  not\n                                                \nan independently sufficient  ground for denying asylum.

Moreover, Board precedent  and agency\nregulations  indicate  that  the Board  will  choose  to deny\nasylum if it finds that the agency has proven that it is more\nlikely than not that petitioner  lacks a well-founded fear of\npersecution.

Official Notice\n                   \n\n          Petitioner's  second  major  argument  is that  the\n\nBoard's taking  of official  notice of  extra-record material\n\nfell short  of fundamental standards of  procedural fairness.\n\nSince the noticed  material is  likely to  play an  important\n\n                    \n\n208.13(b)(1).  In this case,  a careful reading of the record\nsuggests  that  there  is   conflicting  evidence  about  the\nlikelihood  of  future  persecution.   As  will  be discussed\nbelow, our  crystal ball  may also  be clouded  by procedural\nerror.  Petitioner was not afforded an opportunity to respond\nto   the  noticed  fact   that  Amharas  have   not  suffered\npersecution  under the new  regime, a fact  which has clearly\nplayed an important role in the case.  As a result, we cannot\nconclude that remand would be a futile gesture.\n\n23.  We  note that  the Board appears  to have  misstated the\nagency's  own guidelines  for  exercising  discretion  in  an\nasylum case.  The Board stated:\n\n          Even if one were to assume, however, that\n          [petitioner's]  previous  experiences  in\n          Ethiopia did amount  to past persecution,\n          or that at the time  he left and for some\n          time  thereafter  he had  a  well-founded\n          fear of persecution should  he return, it\n          has not be established that he  presently\n          merits a grant of asylum.\n\nGebremichael I, slip  op. at 3.  The proper rule is that once\n              \nan applicant has shown past persecution, the burden shifts to\nthe  government  to show  that  the applicant  lacks  a well-\nfounded fear  of future  persecution.  See  In re  Chen, Int.\n                                                       \nDec. 3104, slip op. at 4; 8 C.F.R.   208.13(b).\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nrole on remand,24 we  address this issue  as well.  We  first\n\ndiscuss when  and how the  Board may take official  notice of\n\nextra-record facts.  We then determine whether it was  proper\n\nfor  the  Board  to  take notice  of  both  indisputable  and\n\ndisputable   facts   concerning   Ethiopia   without   giving\n\npetitioner  any  warning  or  a  predecision  opportunity  to\n\nrespond.\n\n          1.  The Legal Framework\n                                 \n\n          In    keeping   with    standard   principles    of\n\nadministrative  procedure   and   in  the   absence  of   any\n\nprohibition in the  INA itself, the Board  has the discretion\n\nto take \"official\" or \"administrative\" notice of extra-record\n\nlegislative facts.   See, e.g., Kaczmarczyk v.  INS, 933 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n588, 593 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S.

Professor\nDavis suggests -- and we agree -- that any useful legislative\nfact is properly subject to official notice whether that fact\nis disputable or  not.  3 Administrative Law Treatise, supra,\n                                                            \n  15.11, at 185-87.\n\n27.  Agency regulations promulgated  in 1990 already  provide\nprocedural protection governing the taking of official notice\nby  asylum officers.   See  55 Fed.  Reg. 30,674  (1990) (now\n                          \ncodified  at  8 C.F.R.     208.12(a) (1993))  (\"Prior  to the\nissuance of an adverse decision made in reliance  upon [state\ndepartment materials],  that material must be  identified and\nthe  applicant  must  be  provided  with  an  opportunity  to\ninspect, explain, and  rebut the material .  . . .\")   On its\nface, however, the regulation applies to asylum officers, not\nimmigration judges  or the Board of Immigration  Appeals.  In\nits 1992  decision on  the merits,  the  Board took  official\nnotice of conditions in Ethiopia without referring to section\n208.12(a).  Gebremichael I, slip op. at 2.  Similarly, in its\n                          \ndecision on the motion to reconsider, the Board  claimed that\nits notice-taking  authority derived from  its \"discretionary\npowers of review\"  under 8 C.F.R.    3.1(d)(1) (1993),  which\nsets forth the general powers of the Board.

The  distinction  between  disputable  and  undisputable\nfacts  has also unnecessarily  confused the question  of what\nprocedure  should  govern  official  notice  in   immigration\nproceedings.   For example, the Seventh Circuit has suggested\nthat only \"uncontroverted facts\" are noticeable and then only\nwhen  the applicant has  an adequate opportunity  to respond.\nKaczmarczyk,  933 F.2d  at 594-96.    In contrast,  the Ninth\n           \nCircuit has suggested that the  Board may take notice of both\nindisputable and disputable facts, see Castillo-Villagra, 972\n                                                        \nF.2d  at  1028, but  that  the  Board  need not  provide  any\nopportunity to  rebut  indisputable facts,  see Acewicz,  984\n                                                       \nF.2d at  1060.   The distinction  should  not be  dispositive\nbecause  an applicant  is ordinarily  entitled  \"not only  to\nrefute but, what in this situation is usually more important,\nto supplement, explain, and give different perspective to the\nfacts upon which  the agency relies.\"  Kaczmarczyk,  933 F.2d\n                                                  \nat 596 n.7  (quoting 4 Jacob A.

A  multiplicity of\n\nmotions   for  rehearing  in  this  context  would  have  two\n\nundesirable effects:  dilution of the  applicant's procedural\n\nrights  and   concentration  of  the   incentive  to  prolong\n\nlitigation.  Cf. INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 450 (1985)\n                                   \n\n(discussing  alien's incentive  to delay  deportation through\n\nmeritless  appeals).   Thus,  even if  the availability  of a\n\nmotion to reopen  or reconsider will ordinarily  suffice, the\n\ndemands of due process will, as always,  ultimately depend on\n\n                    \n\n29.  The motion to reopen process was clearly not designed as\nan opportunity to respond  to officially noticed facts.   See\n                                                             \ngenerally  Gomez-Vigil v. INS, 990 F.2d  1111, 1125 (9th Cir.\n                             \n1993) (per  curiam) (Fletcher, J., concurring)  (\"Section 3.2\nproceedings do  not suffice  because they  serve a  different\npurpose and  are intended to  provide relief for  a different\nproblem.\")   An applicant may be constitutionally entitled to\nmarshall old facts  in new ways, although a  motion to reopen\ncannot  be granted unless the evidence offered was previously\nunavailable.   See 8 C.F.R.   3.2.   Further, the filing of a\n                  \nmotion  to reopen  does not  automatically stay  deportation.\nSee Castillo-Villagra,  972 F.2d  at  1029; Kaczmarczyk,  933\n                                                       \nF.2d  at 597 n.9.   Vindication of  an applicant's procedural\nrights  thus  depends on  the  good  faith  of the  Board  in\nhandling the motion to reopen.   Accord Kaczmarczyk, 933 F.2d\n                                                   \nat 597 n.9.\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nthe  circumstances.

We  therefore  turn to  an  analysis  of  the\n\nparticular circumstances animating petitioner's case. \n\n          2.  Petitioner's Opportunity to Respond\n                                                 \n\n          As it was free to do, the Board took administrative\n\nnotice of legislative facts contained in two state department\n\nreports as evidence that petitioner lacks a well-founded fear\n\nof   persecution.    See  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights\n                                                             \n\nPractices  for 1992 (February 1993); Country Reports on Human\n                                                             \n\nRights Practices for  1991 (February 1992).  The  Board cited\n                          \n\nthe reports for the following  propositions:  (1) in late May\n\n1991, President Mengistu Haile-Mariam fled into exile; (2) in\n\nJuly  1991,  a  broad-based  national  conference  adopted  a\n\ncharter establishing a multiparty transitional government  to\n\norganize  elections   before  1994;   (3)  the   transitional\n\ngovernment declared that  all citizens in exile  were welcome\n\nto return; (4)  the change of government  brought significant\n\nimprovement  in human  rights,  particularly with  respect to\n\nfreedom  of  speech,  assembly,  association,  religion,  and\n\ntravel; and  (5) after the  1991 change of  government, there\n\nwere  no  widespread  acts   of  persecution  of  minorities,\n\nincluding  the  Amharas.   Gebremichael  I,  slip op.  at  2;\n                                          \n\nGebremichael II, slip op. at 4. \n               \n\n          Based  on the principles outlined above, all of the\n\nextra-record  facts considered by  the Board were  the proper\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nsubject of official notice.  This is true for the first three\n\n\"commonly  acknowledged  facts\"  concerning  the  change   of\n\ngovernment and statements in public documents.  It is equally\n\ntrue  for the  last two  propositions, even  though they  are\n\nreasonably disputable generalizations about actual conditions\n\nin Ethiopia.\n\n          The more  important question is  whether petitioner\n\nwas  afforded an  adequate  opportunity  to  respond  to  the\n\nnoticed  facts.   The Board  did not  warn petitioner  of its\n\nintention to use extra-record materials; in  neither instance\n\ndid  petitioner have  a  predecision opportunity  to respond.\n\nCf. Acewicz, 984  F.2d at 1061  (finding no procedural  error\n           \n\nwhere applicants did in fact offer evidence before IJ and BIA\n\nin response to noticed change of government).   Arguably, the\n\nmotion to reopen process allowed  the Board to cure the first\n\nprocedural   irregularity   because  petitioner   had   ample\n\nopportunity  to respond to  the material  originally noticed.\n\nHowever,  petitioner never had  an opportunity to  respond to\n\nthe material noticed in the Board's decision on the motion to\n\nreopen and reconsider -- the (disputable) fact that there had\n\nbeen  no widespread  persecution of  Amharas  after the  1991\n\nchange   of  government.    In  depriving  petitioner  of  an\n\nopportunity to  respond to this  newly noticed fact  prior to\n\nits adverse decision  on the motion to reopen and reconsider,\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nthe Board abused our presumption  of good faith and ran afoul\n\nof petitioner's procedural rights.30\n\nC.  Suspension of Deportation\n                             \n\n          In addition to requesting a rehearing on his asylum\n\nrequest,  petitioner  also moved  to  reopen his  deportation\n\nproceedings in order  to apply for suspension  of deportation\n\nunder 8  U.S.C.    1254(a)(1).  Since  the Board  has already\n\ndenied  the   motion  to  reopen  on  the  merits  and  since\n\nsuspension  will be petitioner's only remaining remedy if the\n\nBoard exercises  its discretion  to deny  asylum, we  briefly\n\naddress this issue as well.\n\n          Like an asylum  application, suspension involves  a\n\ntwo-step process: (1) a finding of statutory eligibility; and\n\n(2) an  exercise of agency  discretion.  See Vasquez  v. INS,\n                                                            \n\n767 F.2d 598, 601 (9th Cir. 1985).   An alien is eligible for\n\nsuspension of deportation if he\n\n          has been physically present in the United\n          States  for a  continuous  period of  not\n          less   than   seven   years   immediately\n          preceding  the  date of  [the  suspension\n          application;] is  a person of  good moral\n          character;   and   is  a   person   whose\n          deportation would, in the opinion of  the\n          Attorney  General,   result  in   extreme\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n30.  We take no  position on the exact nature  of the process\nthat was due,  such as whether petitioner was  entitled to an\nevidentiary  hearing or merely  an opportunity to  respond to\nthe  noticed facts with  an additional brief  supplemented by\naffidavits or other  documentary evidence.  Nor do  we decide\nin  this  case whether  an  applicant is  always  entitled to\nrespond  when the Board  takes notice of  indisputable extra-\n                                                      \nrecord facts.\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\n          hardship to  the alien or to  his spouse,\n                  \n          parent, or child, who is a citizen of the\n          United  States   or  an   alien  lawfully\n          admitted for permanent residence.\n\n8 U.S.C.   1254(a)(1) (emphasis supplied).\n\n          As with the asylum claim, the Board determined that\n\npetitioner failed to establish statutory eligibility, in this\n\ninstance  by  failing to  make  out  a  prima facie  case  of\n                                                   \n\n\"extreme hardship.\"31  Gebremichael II, slip op. at 4-6.

Petitioner  did not  make any  substantial\n\nallegations about possible economic hardship save his concern\n\nabout abandoning  a career in  the United States.   The Board\n\nalso  considered the  effect  of  past  persecution  and  the\n\npossibility of future  persecution but, in line  with its own\n\nprecedent, refused to attach great weight to such evidence in\n\ndeciding an application for  suspension of deportation, which\n\nis an alternative form of relief to asylum and withholding of\n\ndeportation.32   See Gebremichael II,  slip op. at  5 (citing\n                                    \n\nIn re Kojoory, 12 I. &amp; N.

In  these  consolidated\n                                \n\nappeals, petitioner  Tesfaye  Gebremichael  claims  that  the\n\nBoard of  Immigration Appeals  (the  Board or  BIA) erred  in\n\nfinding   him   ineligible   for   asylum,   withholding   of\n\ndeportation, and suspension of deportation.  See 8  U.S.C.   \n                                                \n\n1158(a),  1253(h),  and  1254(a)  (1988  &amp;  Supp.  IV  1992).\n\nPetitioner's  principal argument is  that he is  eligible for\n\nasylum as a result of  the detention and torture visited upon\n\nhim as a  means of persecuting his brother.   Petitioner also\n\nraises the vexing procedural issue of when the Board can take\n\n\"official  notice\" of  country  conditions without  giving an\n\nalien warning or a predecision opportunity to respond.  After\n\na  careful review,  we hold  that  petitioner is  statutorily\n\neligible for asylum  and that he is entitled  to a meaningful\n\nopportunity to respond  to extra-record facts noticed  by the\n\nBoard. \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                         BACKGROUND1\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          Petitioner is an Ethiopian alien of Amhara descent.\n\nHe was born in 1960 in Addis Ababa, where some family members\n\ncontinue  to live.   In  his early  years he lived  under the\n\nshadow of the repressive Mengistu regime, although he himself\n\n                    \n\n1.  Since  neither  the  underlying  facts  nor  petitioner's\ncredibility are in dispute, we lay out the facts as described\nby petitioner's testimony and other information in the record\nsubmitted by him.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nnever  suffered physical  harm or  a  deprivation of  liberty\n\nuntil he  was older.2   Petitioner was allowed to  finish his\n\neducation.   In 1981, he received an  engineering degree from\n\nthe  University of Addis Ababa and was ordered to work at the\n\nEthiopian Construction Authority.  \n\n          In   September  1982,   the  military   authorities\n\narrested petitioner's father and younger brother as they were\n\nparticipating  in a  Seventh Day  Adventist service.3   It is\n\nundisputed  that  the  father  and brother  were  persecuted,\n\nalthough  it  is  unclear  whether  they  suffered  religious\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under the feudal regime  of Haile Selassie,  petitioner's\nfamily was the wealthy owner of several businesses.   Shortly\nafter  a revolution in  1974, the Dergue,  headed by Mengistu\nHaile Mariam, took  power and imposed a Marxist  regime.  The\nDergue carried out a campaign of repression that included the\nidentification  of individuals who had been among the wealthy\nclass under the  former government,  repression of  religious\nand political opposition activity, and extensive surveillance\nof civilians by local committees.  The Dergue confiscated the\nproperty  of  petitioner's  family.     Petitioner,  who  was\nfourteen  years  old  at  the  time,  became  active   in  an\nopposition organization,  although the Dergue  was apparently\nnot aware of  his political activity, if at  all, until after\nhe left the country.  In the \"Red Terror\" of 1976, the Dergue\nheightened its  repressive activity and killed many suspected\nopponents, frequently targeting families -- many of whom were\nAmhara  -- who  had enjoyed  a privileged status  under Haile\nSelassie.   Petitioner does not  claim that he or  his family\nfell victim to the Red Terror.\n\n3.  While the rest of petitioner's  immediate family remained\nmembers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, petitioner's father\nand  younger brother became Seventh Day Adventists just after\nthe revolution.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\npersecution, political persecution,  or both.4  In  any case,\n\npetitioner's  father was imprisoned for over two years before\n\nhe  was released.   Petitioner's brother was  also imprisoned\n\nbut, following his transfer to a hospital in January 1983, he\n\nmanaged to escape to the family home.  Petitioner then helped\n\n\"smuggle\" his brother out of the country.5\n\n          Shortly thereafter  petitioner was arrested  by the\n\nDergue.  Although  the authorities did not have  -- and never\n\nobtained  --  any  information  linking   petitioner  to  his\n\nbrother's escape, petitioner was accused of aiding the escape\n\nof  an  enemy of  the  state.   Petitioner was  taken  to the\n\nCentral  Investigation  Center,  controlled   by  the  agency\n\nresponsible for  investigating anti-revolutionary  activities\n\nand opposition  to the government.   Every day for  two weeks\n\nDergue personnel interrogated and tortured petitioner as they\n\ntried  to force him  to reveal  his brother's  hiding place.6\n\n                    \n\n4.  According  to petitioner,  in an  attempt  to coerce  his\nfather  and brother into  renouncing their religious beliefs,\nthe Dergue accused  them of \"using  the name of  God and  the\nchurch  to propagate false  information against the  state by\nworking  together with  foreign  Interventionists (i.e.,  the\nCIA) who sought to overthrow  the government.\"  To the extent\nthat  the Dergue imputed pro-Western political beliefs to the\nfather  and  brother,  they   may  have  suffered   political\npersecution.\n\n5.  The  brother has since  been granted political  asylum in\nthe United States.\n\n6.  Petitioner described his experience as follows:\n\n          Each day, I  would be taken from  my cell\n          to a  room where the  interrogations took\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nPetitioner was then  held for an additional three  and a half\n\nmonths  in a  different section  of the  Center.   He  was no\n\nlonger interrogated but  was occasionally forced to  crawl on\n\nsharp stones.   In  late June  1983, petitioner  was released\n\nafter the  Dergue  learned  that  his brother  had  left  the\n\ncountry.  Upon release he was threatened with execution if he\n\nwere  to  engage  in any  political  or  religious activities\n\ndisfavored by  the government.   There is little  evidence in\n\n                    \n\n          place.   There, two men  with masks  over\n          their heads would beat me on the soles of\n          my feet [and] then they would call in the\n          political cadre, who demanded information\n          about my brother.   I always said  that I\n          knew  nothing  about his  whereabouts  or\n          this escape.   The political  cadre would\n          then  order  the  other  men  to  inflict\n          various tortures on me  before I would be\n          subjected to the next round of questions.\n          Sometimes they would push my  head into a\n          tank of  filthy water until I nearly lost\n          consciousness.  Then they would let me up\n          and  I would  be  questioned  again.   At\n          other times  they would threaten  to kill\n          me and then  enact a mock execution.   In\n          still  another  method  used  to make  me\n          talk, they would throw me  onto the floor\n          of  a dark cell  and kick me  all over my\n          body, including my head and genitals.  On\n          other occasions  I would just  be beaten,\n          and  frequently I was made to crawl on my\n          knees over  sharp stones for a  half hour\n          at a  time.   In  all, the  interrogation\n          sessions  usually   lasted  approximately\n          three  hours, at the end of which I could\n          be physically thrown or kicked back  into\n          my cell.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthe  record  that  petitioner   was  ever  formally  charged,\n\nprosecuted, or convicted.7  \n\n          Fearing  additional  mistreatment   if  the  Dergue\n\nlearned  of his  role  in  his brother's  escape  or his  own\n\nopposition  political activities,  petitioner  made plans  to\n\nleave  the country.   He  obtained an  illegal  passport and,\n\nthrough UNESCO,  secured a  student visa  and scholarship  to\n\nattend graduate school in Sierra  Leone.  He left Ethiopia in\n\nOctober 1983.\n\n          After   completing  his   studies  in   June  1985,\n\npetitioner  still  feared  persecution  should  he  return to\n\nEthiopia but  believed he would  not be allowed to  remain in\n\nSierra Leone.  While it  is not clear when petitioner decided\n\nto  attempt to  stay in  the United  States, he  entered this\n\ncountry on June  23, 1985, with a six  month visitor's visa.8\n\nPetitioner applied for asylum on December 12, 1985.\n\n          At  a   deportation  hearing   later  that   month,\n\npetitioner conceded  deportability but moved  for three forms\n\nof  relief  from   deportation  under  the   Immigration  and\n\n                    \n\n7.  We   note  again  that  the  immigration  judge  did  not\ndiscredit petitioner's  testimony, which was  corroborated to\nan  extent by  a physical  examination  of petitioner  (which\nshowed permanent scars on his knees) as well as evidence from\nthe   State  Department   and   human  rights   organizations\ndescribing the Dergue's typical torture techniques.\n\n8.  Petitioner's brother was  living in the United  States at\nthe time.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nNationality  Act  (INA):  political asylum,9  withholding  of\n\ndeportation10  and  voluntary  departure.11     8  U.S.C.    \n\n1158(a), 1253(h), and 1254(e) (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992).  The IJ\n\ngranted  petitioner's  request  for voluntary  departure  but\n\ndenied  the other two applications.  Petitioner then appealed\n\nto  the Board,  which received  briefs in  November  1989 and\n\nheard oral argument in March 1990.  The Board did not issue a\n\ndecision until two years had passed.\n\n                    \n\n9.  Under  8 U.S.C.    1158(a)  the  Attorney General  (whose\nauthority  in these  matters  is delegated  to the  INS, with\nreview by the Board) has the discretion to grant asylum to an\nalien who  qualifies as a  \"refugee\" within the meaning  of 8\nU.S.C.    1101(a)(42)(A) (1988).   In relevant  part, section\n1101(a)(42)(A) defines \"refugee\" as\n\n          any  person who is outside any country of\n          such person's nationality  . . . and  who\n          is unable  or unwilling to return to, and\n          is unable  or unwilling to  avail himself\n          or  herself of  the  protection of,  that\n          country because of persecution or a well-\n          founded fear of persecution on account of\n          race,  religion, nationality,  membership\n          in   a   particular  social   group,   or\n          political opinion.\n\n10.  8  U.S.C.    1253(h)(1)  provides  that \"[t]he  Attorney\nGeneral shall  not deport  or return  any alien  . .  . to  a\ncountry  if the Attorney General determines that such alien's\nlife or  freedom  would  be threatened  in  such  country  on\naccount  of  race,  religion,  nationality, membership  in  a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\n\n11.  8  U.S.C.     1254(e)(1)   gives  the  Attorney  General\ndiscretion to \"permit any alien under deportation proceedings\n. . . to depart voluntarily from the United States at his own\nexpense in lieu of deportation if such alien  shall establish\nto the satisfaction  of the Attorney General that  he is, and\nhas  been, a person of good moral character for at least five\nyears  immediately preceding  his  application for  voluntary\ndeparture.\"\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          In the intervening time, conditions in Ethiopia had\n\nchanged drastically.  Mengistu fled  the country in May 1991,\n\nthe   Dergue  was  quickly   dismantled,  and   a  multiparty\n\ntransitional   government   was   established   to   organize\n\ndemocratic elections.   The transitional  government declared\n\nthat citizens in exile were welcome to return.\n\n          In  its decision on  March 25, 1992,  the Board not\n\nonly reviewed the  record de novo but also  looked beyond the\n                                 \n\nrecord to take administrative notice of the political changes\n\nin Ethiopia as  described in a state department  report.  The\n\nBoard did  not inform petitioner  of its intention  to notice\n\nthese facts,  nor did it  give  petitioner an  opportunity to\n\nrespond.    Although  it  extended  the  time  for  voluntary\n\ndeparture,  the   Board  affirmed   the  IJ's   finding  that\n\npetitioner  was not eligible for either asylum or withholding\n\nof deportation.\n\n          The Board  found petitioner  ineligible for  asylum\n\nfor  failure  to prove  either  past persecution  or  a well-\n\nfounded  fear of future persecution.  The Board reasoned that\n\npetitioner had not shown  that the \"reprehensible\"  detention\n\nand torture inflicted  on him in 1983 were \"to punish him for\n\none of the five grounds specified in the [INA] rather than to\n\ncompel him to reveal the whereabouts of his missing brother.\"\n\nIn re  Gebremichael, No. A26876916,  slip op. at 3  (BIA Mar.\n                   \n\n25,  1992)  (Gebremichael  I).

The\n\nBoard  did not find  that the harm  inflicted upon petitioner\n\nwas too mild to  constitute persecution.  Instead, the  Board\n\nessentially held that petitioner was merely a vehicle for the\n\npersecution   of  his   brother  and   not   the  victim   of\n\n\"persecution\"  within the  meaning  of the  INA.   The  Board\n\nreasonably found  that the Dergue did not  detain and torture\n\npetitioner because of his own  actual or imputed political or\n\nreligious beliefs.    Nonetheless,  however  reasonable  this\n\nfinding,  it does not  dispose of petitioner's  asylum claim.\n\nPetitioner argues --  and we agree -- that  he was persecuted\n\nfor other reasons equally cognizable under the INA. \n         \n\n          Petitioner's  strongest argument  is  that he  is a\n\nrefugee  because  he   was  mistreated  on  account   of  his\n\nrelationship  to his  brother.19   While  most asylum  claims\n\n                    \n\n19.  Petitioner  also advances two  other theories to support\nhis  claim of  past persecution:  (1)  he is  a political  or\nreligious refugee because he was  an intended conduit for the\npolitical or religious persecution of another;  and (2) he is\na  political refugee because he suffered excessive punishment\nunder  suspicious  circumstances.   In  addition,  petitioner\nclaims that he is eligible for asylum based on a well-founded\nfear  that he  will face  future persecution  in Ethiopia  on\naccount  of his ethnicity, social status and political views.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ninvolve  other  types  of persecution,  the  INA  also offers\n\nrefugee status to victims of \"persecution on account of . . .\n\nmembership  in  a  particular  social  group.\"    8  U.S.C.  \n\n1101(a)(42)(A).20   An  applicant  qualifies as  a  \"refugee\"\n\nunder the INA if membership in a social group is \"at the root\n\nof  persecution,\"  such  that membership  itself  generates a\n\n\"specific threat to the  [applicant].\"  Ananeh-Firempong, 766\n                                                        \n\nF.2d   at   626-27   (citation   and   quotation    omitted).\n\nAccordingly,   we  must  determine  whether  a  family  is  a\n\ncognizable  \"social group\" within the meaning of the INA and,\n\nif  so, whether  petitioner's torture  and  detention by  the\n\nauthorities can be traced to his family membership.\n\n          In  laying out  general  principles governing  this\n\ntype of persecution, the Board has stated that\n\n                    \n\nIn light  of our  holding below that  petitioner is  a social\nrefugee based on  past persecution, we  do not address  these\nother theories.\n\n20.

In the\n\ncase  on appeal,  the  link  between  family  membership  and\n\npersecution is manifest:  as the record  makes clear and  the\n\nINS itself concedes, the Ethiopian security forces applied to\n\npetitioner the  \"time-honored theory  of cherchez  la famille\n                                                             \n\n(`look for  the family'),\"  the terrorization  of one  family\n\nmember to extract  information about the location  of another\n\nfamily member or  to force the missing family  member to come\n\nforward.  As  a result, we are compelled  to conclude that no\n\nreasonable  factfinder could fail to find that petitioner was\n\nsingled out for  mistreatment because of his  relationship to\n\nhis  brother.

Petitioner was not afforded an opportunity to respond\nto   the  noticed  fact   that  Amharas  have   not  suffered\npersecution  under the new  regime, a fact  which has clearly\nplayed an important role in the case.  As a result, we cannot\nconclude that remand would be a futile gesture.\n\n23.  We  note that  the Board appears  to have  misstated the\nagency's  own guidelines  for  exercising  discretion  in  an\nasylum case.  The Board stated:\n\n          Even if one were to assume, however, that\n          [petitioner's]  previous  experiences  in\n          Ethiopia did amount  to past persecution,\n          or that at the time  he left and for some\n          time  thereafter  he had  a  well-founded\n          fear of persecution should  he return, it\n          has not be established that he  presently\n          merits a grant of asylum.\n\nGebremichael I, slip  op. at 3.

Agency regulations promulgated  in 1990 already  provide\nprocedural protection governing the taking of official notice\nby  asylum officers.   See  55 Fed.

The  distinction  between  disputable  and  undisputable\nfacts  has also unnecessarily  confused the question  of what\nprocedure  should  govern  official  notice  in   immigration\nproceedings.   For example, the Seventh Circuit has suggested\nthat only \"uncontroverted facts\" are noticeable and then only\nwhen  the applicant has  an adequate opportunity  to respond.\nKaczmarczyk,  933 F.2d  at 594-96.    In contrast,  the Ninth\n           \nCircuit has suggested that the  Board may take notice of both\nindisputable and disputable facts, see Castillo-Villagra, 972\n                                                        \nF.2d  at  1028, but  that  the  Board  need not  provide  any\nopportunity to  rebut  indisputable facts,  see Acewicz,  984\n                                                       \nF.2d at  1060.   The distinction  should  not be  dispositive\nbecause  an applicant  is ordinarily  entitled  \"not only  to\nrefute but, what in this situation is usually more important,\nto supplement, explain, and give different perspective to the\nfacts upon which  the agency relies.\"  Kaczmarczyk,  933 F.2d\n                                                  \nat 596 n.7  (quoting 4 Jacob A.

A  multiplicity of\n\nmotions   for  rehearing  in  this  context  would  have  two\n\nundesirable effects:  dilution of the  applicant's procedural\n\nrights  and   concentration  of  the   incentive  to  prolong\n\nlitigation.

Petitioner's Opportunity to Respond\n                                                 \n\n          As it was free to do, the Board took administrative\n\nnotice of legislative facts contained in two state department\n\nreports as evidence that petitioner lacks a well-founded fear\n\nof   persecution.    See  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights\n                                                             \n\nPractices  for 1992 (February 1993); Country Reports on Human\n                                                             \n\nRights Practices for  1991 (February 1992).  The  Board cited\n                          \n\nthe reports for the following  propositions:  (1) in late May\n\n1991, President Mengistu Haile-Mariam fled into exile; (2) in\n\nJuly  1991,  a  broad-based  national  conference  adopted  a\n\ncharter establishing a multiparty transitional government  to\n\norganize  elections   before  1994;   (3)  the   transitional\n\ngovernment declared that  all citizens in exile  were welcome\n\nto return; (4)  the change of government  brought significant\n\nimprovement  in human  rights,  particularly with  respect to\n\nfreedom  of  speech,  assembly,  association,  religion,  and\n\ntravel; and  (5) after the  1991 change of  government, there\n\nwere  no  widespread  acts   of  persecution  of  minorities,\n\nincluding  the  Amharas.   Gebremichael  I,  slip op.  at  2;\n                                          \n\nGebremichael II, slip op. at 4. \n               \n\n          Based  on the principles outlined above, all of the\n\nextra-record  facts considered by  the Board were  the proper\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nsubject of official notice.  This is true for the first three\n\n\"commonly  acknowledged  facts\"  concerning  the  change   of\n\ngovernment and statements in public documents.  It is equally\n\ntrue  for the  last two  propositions, even  though they  are\n\nreasonably disputable generalizations about actual conditions\n\nin Ethiopia.\n\n          The more  important question is  whether petitioner\n\nwas  afforded an  adequate  opportunity  to  respond  to  the\n\nnoticed  facts.   The Board  did not  warn petitioner  of its\n\nintention to use extra-record materials; in  neither instance\n\ndid  petitioner have  a  predecision opportunity  to respond.\n\nCf. Acewicz, 984  F.2d at 1061  (finding no procedural  error\n           \n\nwhere applicants did in fact offer evidence before IJ and BIA\n\nin response to noticed change of government).   Arguably, the\n\nmotion to reopen process allowed  the Board to cure the first\n\nprocedural   irregularity   because  petitioner   had   ample\n\nopportunity  to respond to  the material  originally noticed.\n\nHowever,  petitioner never had  an opportunity to  respond to\n\nthe material noticed in the Board's decision on the motion to\n\nreopen and reconsider -- the (disputable) fact that there had\n\nbeen  no widespread  persecution of  Amharas  after the  1991\n\nchange   of  government.

Since  the Board  has already\n\ndenied  the   motion  to  reopen  on  the  merits  and  since\n\nsuspension  will be petitioner's only remaining remedy if the\n\nBoard exercises  its discretion  to deny  asylum, we  briefly\n\naddress this issue as well.\n\n          Like an asylum  application, suspension involves  a\n\ntwo-step process: (1) a finding of statutory eligibility; and\n\n(2) an  exercise of agency  discretion.
