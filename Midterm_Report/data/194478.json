For\n\nthe  reasons set forth below, we  affirm the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims except\n\nhis  First Amendment claim  for equitable relief.   We remand\n\nthat claim for further proceedings.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          As always, we review  the district court's  summary\n\njudgment ruling de novo,  reading the record in a  light most\n                       \n\namiable to  the nonmoving  party.   See Federal  Deposit Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v.  World Univ., Inc., No. 92-1389,  slip op. at 4 (1st\n                           \n\nCir. Oct. 22, 1992).  Plaintiff  is a career employee of  the\n\nState Insurance Fund of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"the\n\nFund\") who, at the  time he filed his complaint,  had accrued\n\nmore than twenty-three years of public service.  He also is a\n\nmember   of  the   New  Progressive   Party  (\"NPP\"),   whose\n\ngubernatorial candidate lost the general election of November\n\n6, 1984.\n\n          At the  time  the complaint  was  filed,  defendant\n\nCirilo  Tirado  Delgado  was  the  Fund's  Administrator  and\n\ndefendant Rafael  Rivera Gonzalez was the  Fund's Director of\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPersonnel.    Both  defendants  are members  of  the  Popular\n\nDemocratic  Party (\"PDP\"), whose  gubernatorial candidate won\n\nthe  1984  election.    Defendants were  appointed  to  their\n\npositions subsequent  to January  2,  1985, the  day the  PDP\n\ncandidate assumed the governorship of the Commonwealth.\n\n          Prior to the 1984  election, plaintiff was Chief of\n\nthe  Fund's Finance  Division.   Plaintiff  contends that  as\n\nChief, he directed, supervised, and  coordinated all Sections\n\nof the Finance Division,  including the Pay Vouchers Section,\n\nthe  Collections  Section,  and  the  Claims  and Attachments\n\nSection.   He further  asserts that he  coordinated \"all  the\n\ndeposits of funds  pertaining to the State  Insurance Fund in\n\nthe Government Bank and other commercial banks.\"  \n\n          The complaint  alleges that from July  1985 through\n\nNovember 1985,  defendants did not permit  plaintiff to carry\n\nout  the duties  of his  position.   It further  states that,\n\nsince  November 1985,  plaintiff has  been assigned  \"a small\n\namount  of functions  belonging  to lesser  positions in  the\n\n[Fund]. .  . .\"  Plaintiff's sworn declaration,  submitted in\n\nopposition to defendants' summary judgment  motion, clarifies\n\nthat, subsequent to the election, plaintiff was reassigned to\n\nthe  position  of  Assistant  to  the  Chief  of  the  Fund's\n\nCollection Division.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Defendants  contend  that  plaintiff's reassignment  took\nplace pursuant  to  a reorganization  of  the Fund  that  was\ncarried  out  late in  1985.    Plaintiff  asserts  that  the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          Plaintiff  claims that, since his reassignment, the\n\nfunctions and  duties  of  the  Assistant  to  the  Chief  of\n\nCollections have not been  delegated to him, and that  he has\n\nbeen  allotted only nominal tasks which take no more than ten\n\nminutes  a day to perform.  Plaintiff further claims that the\n\nChief of  the Fund's Collection Division,  whom plaintiff now\n\nis assisting, previously  was under his supervision.  He also\n\nalleges that  defendants have  deprived him of  the following\n\npreviously-obtained   rights   and  benefits:   (1)  personal\n\nsecretary, (2) parking space,  (3) office, (4) telephone, (5)\n\nsupervision  of other  employees,  and (6)  access to  office\n\nrecords and  documents.  Finally, plaintiff  contends that he\n\nwas  placed in  a  lower  salary  scale which  has  adversely\n\naffected his ability  to obtain certain pay  raises, and that\n\nhe  is subject  to  daily ridicule  and harassment  which, in\n\nconjunction with  the other circumstances of  his job change,\n\ncause him to feel as if he  actually has been discharged from\n\nhis   employment.2     It   is   plaintiff's  position   that\n\ndefendants' actions were precipitated by his affiliation with\n\nthe NPP.\n\n                    \n\nreorganization was  a sham whose  true purpose was  to demote\nemployees who were  members of  the NPP and  to replace  them\nwith  PDP members.  Plaintiff further asserts that he was, in\nfact,  replaced  by  active PDP  members,  and  that  all the\nemployees   who   were   demoted   pursuant   to   the   1985\nreorganization were affiliated with the NPP.\n\n2.  The record reveals, however,  that plaintiff has not left\nhis employment with the Fund.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          In  June  of  1986,  plaintiff  filed  this  action\n\npursuant  to, inter  alia, 42  U.S.C.    1983,  alleging that\n                         \n\ndefendants had  violated rights  secured him under  the First\n\nand  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiff's  complaint  sought  both  damages  and  equitable\n\nrelief  in the  form of  temporary and  permanent injunctions\n\ndirecting  defendants to  reinstate plaintiff  to his  former\n\nemployment  and  to  refrain  from acting  toward  him  in an\n\nunconstitutional  manner.   Subsequently, defendants  filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff's  claims\n\nunder    1983 were insufficiently supported  to forestall the\n\nentry of judgment in their favor.  The district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion,  ruling (1) that  plaintiff  had not been\n\nconstructively discharged, (2) that plaintiff had not offered\n\nsufficient  proof on his claim that,  since his transfer, his\n\nwork situation  was so  \"unreasonably inferior to  the norm,\"\n\nsee Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209,  1218\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (en banc) (announcing this circuit's standard\n\nfor  evaluating  First Amendment  political affiliation-based\n\nemployment discrimination  claims where the employee  has not\n\nbeen   discharged)   (hereinafter  \"the   Agosto-de-Feliciano\n                                                             \n\nclaim\"), that it violated the First Amendment,3 and (3)  that\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  district court  alternatively  ruled  that  even  if\nplaintiff had adequately supported his First Amendment claim,\ndefendants would be entitled  to qualified immunity therefrom\ninsofar  as  plaintiff was  seeking  civil  damages from  the\ndefendants in their individual capacities.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nplaintiff  had  not  been  deprived  of  any  property  right\n\nprotected   by  the  Fourteenth   Amendment.4     On  appeal,\n\nplaintiff challenges all of the district court's rulings.  We\n\ndiscuss each in turn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  The First Amendment\n                       \n\n1.  Plaintiff's Constructive Discharge Claim\n                                            \n\n          Plaintiff  argues that the  district court erred in\n\nruling that  he was not constructively  discharged.  However,\n\nwe recently  made  clear that  a  First Amendment  \"claim  of\n\nconstructive discharge  due to a demotion  or transfer cannot\n\nsucceed when  a claimant, in fact, has  not left employment.\"\n\nPedro-Cos  v. Contreras, 976 F.2d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 1992) (per\n                       \n\ncuriam) (surveying pertinent First Circuit authority).  Here,\n\nthe  record   reflects  that  plaintiff  has   not  left  his\n\nemployment with  the Fund.  Thus,  his constructive discharge\n\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n2.  Plaintiff's Agosto-de-Feliciano Claim5\n\n2.  Plaintiff's Agosto-de-Feliciano Claim5\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n4.  At  the  same  time,  the court  also  dismissed  several\npendent state claims brought by plaintiff.\n\n5.  In   his  concurrence,  Judge   Torruella  questions  the\ncontinuing  vitality of  Agosto-de-Feliciano in light  of the\n                                            \nSupreme  Court's  ruling  in  Rutan v.  Republican  Party  of\n                                                             \nIllinois, 110 S.  Ct. 2729 (1990).  Because we  find, as will\n        \nbe discussed  more fully  infra, that there  exist sufficient\n                               \ngenuine  and material factual disputes to  warrant a trial on\nplaintiff's  claim  for  equitable  relief  even  under   the\narguably  more stringent  standard  set  forth in  Agosto-de-\n                                                             \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n     a.  Civil Damages\n                      \n\n          Plaintiff  also  takes  issue  with   the  district\n\ncourt's alternative ruling, see supra note 3, that defendants\n                                     \n\nare entitled  to qualified immunity from his  claim for civil\n\ndamages  under Agosto-de-Feliciano.6   However, we repeatedly\n                                  \n\nhave  stated  that,  prior  to  our  decision  in  Agosto-de-\n                                                             \n\nFeliciano  and the Supreme Court's  decision in Rutan, it was\n                                                     \n\nnot  clearly established that  the constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst  politically  motivated   firings  applied  to  other\n                                         \n\npersonnel  actions, such as promotions, transfers, demotions,\n\nand hirings.  See, e.g., Pedro-Cos, 976 F.2d at 85;  Valiente\n                                                             \n\nv.  Rivera, 966 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1992); Castro-Aponte v.\n                                                          \n\nLigia-Rubero, 953 F.2d 1429, 1430 (1st Cir. 1992).  Here, all\n            \n\nthe complained of adverse  personnel actions took place prior\n\nto  our  decision  in  Agosto-de-Feliciano  and  the  Supreme\n                                          \n\nCourt's decision in Rutan.  As a result, the district court's\n                         \n\nruling that  defendants were entitled  to qualified  immunity\n\nfrom plaintiff's claim for civil damages was plainly correct.\n\n     b.  Equitable Relief\n                         \n\n                    \n\nFeliciano, we do not reach this issue.\n         \n\n6.  The doctrine of  qualified immunity shields  governmental\nofficials performing discretionary  functions from  liability\nfor civil damages when their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory  or  constitutional rights  of which  a\nreasonable person  would have known.   See Rivera  v. Murphy,\n                                                            \nNo. 92-1688, slip op.  at 7 (1st Cir. Nov.  10, 1992) (citing\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).\n                    \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Plaintiff's  claim  for   equitable  relief   under\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano    to     redress    perceived    ongoing\n                   \n\nconstitutional violations  by defendants presents  us with  a\n\nconsiderably  more  difficult issue.    As  noted above,  the\n\ndistrict  court  held  that   plaintiff  did  not   introduce\n\nsufficient  proof on  this claim  to warrant  a trial.   More\n\nspecifically,  the   court  ruled  that  plaintiff   had  not\n\n\"produced enough evidence\"  of a sufficiently severe  decline\n\nin  his work conditions for a factfinder to conclude, under a\n\n\"clear  and convincing  evidence\" standard,  that plaintiff's\n\nwork  situation is \"unreasonably inferior to the norm for the\n\nposition.\"   See generally  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d  at\n                                               \n\n1218-20.  The court  also ruled that plaintiff had  failed to\n\nadduce  evidence sufficient  for a  factfinder to  determine,\n\nunder  a  \"preponderance  of  the  evidence\"  standard,  that\n\ndefendants'  true  motivation  in  taking  their actions  was\n\npolitical affiliation-based discrimination.  See id. at 1220.\n                                                    \n\nIn so doing, the  court found that the allegations  set forth\n\nin  plaintiff's   sworn  complaint  and  elaborated  upon  in\n\nplaintiff's sworn declaration were \"conclusory\"  and, without\n\nmore,  were insufficient  to  defeat  defendants' motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment.  We do not share the district court's view\n\nof plaintiff's evidence.\n\n          Summary judgment acts \"to pierce the boilerplate of\n\nthe pleadings  and  assay  the parties'  proof  in  order  to\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndetermine  whether trial  is  actually required.\"   Wynne  v.\n                                                         \n\nTufts Univ.

It is appropriate where \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions,  answers to  interrogatories, and  admissions on\n\nfile, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as  to any  material fact and  that the  moving\n\nparty  is entitled to judgment as a  matter of law.\"  Fed.

Although the \"unreasonably inferior\n\nto the norm\" standard is not  self-defining and its contours,\n\nat times, may be difficult to ascertain, we have specifically\n\nnoted  some  situations  where  a factfinder  would,  in  all\n\nlikelihood,  be  entitled  to  find  an  employee's  new  job\n\nsituation to  be \"unreasonably inferior.\"   See generally id.\n                                                             \n\nat 1219.

First of all, we do\n\nnot agree  with the  district court that  the allegations  in\n\nplaintiff's sworn complaint, as  elaborated upon in his sworn\n\ndeclaration, are \"conclusory.\"   Rather, our review reveals a\n\nseries of  factual assertions  that are probative  of whether\n\ndefendants are discriminating against  plaintiff on the basis\n\nof his political affiliation.7\n\n          More  importantly, we  find that  plaintiff's sworn\n\nallegations, if believed, could allow a reasonable factfinder\n\nto  find  for  plaintiff.     We  note  that   the  following\n\nallegations  by plaintiff  have in  no way  been conclusively\n\nrebutted:\n\n     (1) that prior to his reassignment, plaintiff      \n         directed,   supervised,  and   coordinated  the\n     Fund's      Finance Division;     \n\n     (2) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         assisting a person who previously was under his\n         supervision;\n\n     (3) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has not \n         been delegated the functions and duties of his \n         new job title;\n\n     (4) that since his reassignment, plaintiff only has\n         been assigned clerical tasks which take ten    \n         minutes a day to perform;\n\n     (5) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         deprived of his supervisory status;\n\n     (6) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         placed in a lower pay scale where he no longer \n         can obtain certain pay raises;\n\n                    \n\n7.  The assertions at  issue are  set forth in  Section I  of\nthis opinion.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n     (7) that plaintiff is a known member of the NPP;\n\n     (8) that plaintiff's prior position was filled by  \n         members of the PDP; and\n\n     (9) that everyone who was demoted during the 1985  \n         reorganization was affiliated with the NPP.\n\nSimply put, we view sworn allegations (1)-(6) as a sufficient\n\nevidentiary  basis for  a  reasonable factfinder  to find  by\n\nclear   and  convincing  evidence  that  plaintiff's  current\n\nposition   is   \"unreasonably   inferior   to   the   norm.\"8\n\nSimilarly,   we  believe   that  allegations   (7)-(9)  could\n\nconstitute an adequate foundation for that same factfinder to\n\nconclude by  a preponderance of the  evidence that defendants\n\nwere motivated  by discrimination  on the basis  of political\n\naffiliation.   Accordingly, we  find that the  district court\n\nshould  not  have  entered summary  judgment  on  plaintiff's\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano claim insofar  as that claim was  seeking\n                   \n\nequitable relief.9 \n\n                    \n\n8.  We note the similarity  between these allegations and the\nexamples of situations that we previously indicated should go\nto the jury.  See Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1219.\n                                     \n\n9.  In their brief, defendants go to  great lengths to assert\na \"changeover\"  defense.  See  generally Agosto-de-Feliciano,\n                                                            \n889 F.2d at 1220-22.  In  so doing, they argue that plaintiff\nwas transferred as part of a legitimate reorganization of the\nFund in  1985.  See  supra note  1.   As stated,  defendants'\n                          \nchangeover  defense may  articulate a  legitimate reason  for\nplaintiff's reassignment.   However,  it makes no  attempt to\nexplain why the reorganization took place along the political\nlines  alleged  by  plaintiff.    Accordingly,  there  remain\ngenuine  issues  of  material fact  as  to  whether the  1985\nreorganization was pretextual.  See id. at 1221-22.\n                                       \n     Moreover,   in  presenting  us   with  their  changeover\nargument, defendants do  not deny or  attempt to explain  why\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.  The Due Process Clause\n                          \n\n          Plaintiff's  final  argument is  that  the district\n\ncourt erred  in granting  defendants summary judgment  on his\n\nclaim,  as  set  forth   generally  in  his  complaint,  that\n\n\"plaintiff's  property interests are being adversely affected\n\nby defendants['] actions . . . in  violation of [plaintiff's]\n\nrights  to due  process under  the Fourteenth Amendment.  . .\n\n.\"10  We disagree with plaintiff's contention.\n\n          Plaintiff's due process claim depends on his having\n\nbeen deprived of a property right without due process of law.\n\nSee Cleveland Bd. of  Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S.  532, 538\n                                         \n\n(1985).   To establish such  a right, \"a  person clearly must\n\nhave more that  an abstract need  or desire for  it.   [S/h]e\n\nmust have more than  a unilateral expectation of it.   [S/h]e\n\n                    \n\nplaintiff (1) has not been delegated the functions and duties\nof his new  job title,  (2) is assigned  only clerical  tasks\nwhich  take  ten minutes  a  day to  perform,  or (3)  is now\nassisting   a   former  subordinate.     Nor   do  defendants\nconclusively refute  plaintiff's claim that  he now  is in  a\nlower pay scale.  Accordingly, defendants' changeover defense\ndoes  not provide us with  an alternative basis for affirming\nthe district  court's entry of  summary judgment in  favor of\ndefendants  on  plaintiff's  Agosto-de-Feliciano   claim  for\n                                                \nequitable relief. \n\n10.  On appeal, plaintiff alleges for the first time that the\nproperty  interests  of   which  he  was   unconstitutionally\ndeprived were the right to remain Chief of the Fund's Finance\nDivision and the  right to  remain in the  same salary  scale\nregardless of his reassignment.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nmust, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\"\n\nBoard   of  Regents  v.

In\n\nfact, plaintiff never  clearly identified the property  right\n\nor rights of which he allegedly  was deprived.11  Nor did  he\n\nattempt  (1)  to identify  the source  of  any such  right or\n\nrights; (2) to explain  how the right or rights  are entitled\n\nto constitutional protection; (3)  to specify the facts which\n\nallegedly support his due  process claim; or (4) to  cite any\n\nlegal authority tending to strengthen his claim.  In light of\n\n                    \n\n11.  At  one  point  in   his  memorandum  in  opposition  to\ndefendants' summary judgment  motion, plaintiff  seems to  be\nasserting that he was deprived of continued public employment\nto which he was legitimately, and therefore constitutionally,\nentitled.  See Roth, 408 U.S.  at 577.  As the district court\n                   \nnoted,  this  argument  fails  for  the  simple  reason  that\nplaintiff has remained employed by the Fund.   \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nthese omissions, it is  apparent that plaintiff presented his\n\ndue  process claim  to  the district  court  in only  a  most\n\nperfunctory manner.

See Federal  Deposit Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v.  World Univ., Inc., No. 92-1389,  slip op. at 4 (1st\n                           \n\nCir. Oct. 22, 1992).  Plaintiff  is a career employee of  the\n\nState Insurance Fund of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"the\n\nFund\") who, at the  time he filed his complaint,  had accrued\n\nmore than twenty-three years of public service.  He also is a\n\nmember   of  the   New  Progressive   Party  (\"NPP\"),   whose\n\ngubernatorial candidate lost the general election of November\n\n6, 1984.\n\n          At the  time  the complaint  was  filed,  defendant\n\nCirilo  Tirado  Delgado  was  the  Fund's  Administrator  and\n\ndefendant Rafael  Rivera Gonzalez was the  Fund's Director of\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPersonnel.    Both  defendants  are members  of  the  Popular\n\nDemocratic  Party (\"PDP\"), whose  gubernatorial candidate won\n\nthe  1984  election.    Defendants were  appointed  to  their\n\npositions subsequent  to January  2,  1985, the  day the  PDP\n\ncandidate assumed the governorship of the Commonwealth.\n\n          Prior to the 1984  election, plaintiff was Chief of\n\nthe  Fund's Finance  Division.   Plaintiff  contends that  as\n\nChief, he directed, supervised, and  coordinated all Sections\n\nof the Finance Division,  including the Pay Vouchers Section,\n\nthe  Collections  Section,  and  the  Claims  and Attachments\n\nSection.   He further  asserts that he  coordinated \"all  the\n\ndeposits of funds  pertaining to the State  Insurance Fund in\n\nthe Government Bank and other commercial banks.\"  \n\n          The complaint  alleges that from July  1985 through\n\nNovember 1985,  defendants did not permit  plaintiff to carry\n\nout  the duties  of his  position.   It further  states that,\n\nsince  November 1985,  plaintiff has  been assigned  \"a small\n\namount  of functions  belonging  to lesser  positions in  the\n\n[Fund]. .  . .\"  Plaintiff's sworn declaration,  submitted in\n\nopposition to defendants' summary judgment  motion, clarifies\n\nthat, subsequent to the election, plaintiff was reassigned to\n\nthe  position  of  Assistant  to  the  Chief  of  the  Fund's\n\nCollection Division.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Defendants  contend  that  plaintiff's reassignment  took\nplace pursuant  to  a reorganization  of  the Fund  that  was\ncarried  out  late in  1985.    Plaintiff  asserts  that  the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          Plaintiff  claims that, since his reassignment, the\n\nfunctions and  duties  of  the  Assistant  to  the  Chief  of\n\nCollections have not been  delegated to him, and that  he has\n\nbeen  allotted only nominal tasks which take no more than ten\n\nminutes  a day to perform.  Plaintiff further claims that the\n\nChief of  the Fund's Collection Division,  whom plaintiff now\n\nis assisting, previously  was under his supervision.  He also\n\nalleges that  defendants have  deprived him of  the following\n\npreviously-obtained   rights   and  benefits:   (1)  personal\n\nsecretary, (2) parking space,  (3) office, (4) telephone, (5)\n\nsupervision  of other  employees,  and (6)  access to  office\n\nrecords and  documents.  Finally, plaintiff  contends that he\n\nwas  placed in  a  lower  salary  scale which  has  adversely\n\naffected his ability  to obtain certain pay  raises, and that\n\nhe  is subject  to  daily ridicule  and harassment  which, in\n\nconjunction with  the other circumstances of  his job change,\n\ncause him to feel as if he  actually has been discharged from\n\nhis   employment.2     It   is   plaintiff's  position   that\n\ndefendants' actions were precipitated by his affiliation with\n\nthe NPP.\n\n                    \n\nreorganization was  a sham whose  true purpose was  to demote\nemployees who were  members of  the NPP and  to replace  them\nwith  PDP members.  Plaintiff further asserts that he was, in\nfact,  replaced  by  active PDP  members,  and  that  all the\nemployees   who   were   demoted   pursuant   to   the   1985\nreorganization were affiliated with the NPP.\n\n2.  The record reveals, however,  that plaintiff has not left\nhis employment with the Fund.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          In  June  of  1986,  plaintiff  filed  this  action\n\npursuant  to, inter  alia, 42  U.S.C.    1983,  alleging that\n                         \n\ndefendants had  violated rights  secured him under  the First\n\nand  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiff's  complaint  sought  both  damages  and  equitable\n\nrelief  in the  form of  temporary and  permanent injunctions\n\ndirecting  defendants to  reinstate plaintiff  to his  former\n\nemployment  and  to  refrain  from acting  toward  him  in an\n\nunconstitutional  manner.   Subsequently, defendants  filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff's  claims\n\nunder    1983 were insufficiently supported  to forestall the\n\nentry of judgment in their favor.  The district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion,  ruling (1) that  plaintiff  had not been\n\nconstructively discharged, (2) that plaintiff had not offered\n\nsufficient  proof on his claim that,  since his transfer, his\n\nwork situation  was so  \"unreasonably inferior to  the norm,\"\n\nsee Agosto-de-Feliciano v.

Here,\n\nthe  record   reflects  that  plaintiff  has   not  left  his\n\nemployment with  the Fund.  Thus,  his constructive discharge\n\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n2.

At  the  same  time,  the court  also  dismissed  several\npendent state claims brought by plaintiff.\n\n5.  In   his  concurrence,  Judge   Torruella  questions  the\ncontinuing  vitality of  Agosto-de-Feliciano in light  of the\n                                            \nSupreme  Court's  ruling  in  Rutan v.

Civil Damages\n                      \n\n          Plaintiff  also  takes  issue  with   the  district\n\ncourt's alternative ruling, see supra note 3, that defendants\n                                     \n\nare entitled  to qualified immunity from his  claim for civil\n\ndamages  under Agosto-de-Feliciano.6   However, we repeatedly\n                                  \n\nhave  stated  that,  prior  to  our  decision  in  Agosto-de-\n                                                             \n\nFeliciano  and the Supreme Court's  decision in Rutan, it was\n                                                     \n\nnot  clearly established that  the constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst  politically  motivated   firings  applied  to  other\n                                         \n\npersonnel  actions, such as promotions, transfers, demotions,\n\nand hirings.

As a result, the district court's\n                         \n\nruling that  defendants were entitled  to qualified  immunity\n\nfrom plaintiff's claim for civil damages was plainly correct.\n\n     b.

As  noted above,  the\n\ndistrict  court  held  that   plaintiff  did  not   introduce\n\nsufficient  proof on  this claim  to warrant  a trial.   More\n\nspecifically,  the   court  ruled  that  plaintiff   had  not\n\n\"produced enough evidence\"  of a sufficiently severe  decline\n\nin  his work conditions for a factfinder to conclude, under a\n\n\"clear  and convincing  evidence\" standard,  that plaintiff's\n\nwork  situation is \"unreasonably inferior to the norm for the\n\nposition.\"   See generally  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d  at\n                                               \n\n1218-20.

First of all, we do\n\nnot agree  with the  district court that  the allegations  in\n\nplaintiff's sworn complaint, as  elaborated upon in his sworn\n\ndeclaration, are \"conclusory.\"   Rather, our review reveals a\n\nseries of  factual assertions  that are probative  of whether\n\ndefendants are discriminating against  plaintiff on the basis\n\nof his political affiliation.7\n\n          More  importantly, we  find that  plaintiff's sworn\n\nallegations, if believed, could allow a reasonable factfinder\n\nto  find  for  plaintiff.     We  note  that   the  following\n\nallegations  by plaintiff  have in  no way  been conclusively\n\nrebutted:\n\n     (1) that prior to his reassignment, plaintiff      \n         directed,   supervised,  and   coordinated  the\n     Fund's      Finance Division;     \n\n     (2) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         assisting a person who previously was under his\n         supervision;\n\n     (3) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has not \n         been delegated the functions and duties of his \n         new job title;\n\n     (4) that since his reassignment, plaintiff only has\n         been assigned clerical tasks which take ten    \n         minutes a day to perform;\n\n     (5) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         deprived of his supervisory status;\n\n     (6) that since his reassignment, plaintiff has been\n         placed in a lower pay scale where he no longer \n         can obtain certain pay raises;\n\n                    \n\n7.  The assertions at  issue are  set forth in  Section I  of\nthis opinion.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n     (7) that plaintiff is a known member of the NPP;\n\n     (8) that plaintiff's prior position was filled by  \n         members of the PDP; and\n\n     (9) that everyone who was demoted during the 1985  \n         reorganization was affiliated with the NPP.\n\nSimply put, we view sworn allegations (1)-(6) as a sufficient\n\nevidentiary  basis for  a  reasonable factfinder  to find  by\n\nclear   and  convincing  evidence  that  plaintiff's  current\n\nposition   is   \"unreasonably   inferior   to   the   norm.\"8\n\nSimilarly,   we  believe   that  allegations   (7)-(9)  could\n\nconstitute an adequate foundation for that same factfinder to\n\nconclude by  a preponderance of the  evidence that defendants\n\nwere motivated  by discrimination  on the basis  of political\n\naffiliation.   Accordingly, we  find that the  district court\n\nshould  not  have  entered summary  judgment  on  plaintiff's\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano claim insofar  as that claim was  seeking\n                   \n\nequitable relief.9 \n\n                    \n\n8.  We note the similarity  between these allegations and the\nexamples of situations that we previously indicated should go\nto the jury.  See Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1219.\n                                     \n\n9.  In their brief, defendants go to  great lengths to assert\na \"changeover\"  defense.  See  generally Agosto-de-Feliciano,\n                                                            \n889 F.2d at 1220-22.  In  so doing, they argue that plaintiff\nwas transferred as part of a legitimate reorganization of the\nFund in  1985.  See  supra note  1.   As stated,  defendants'\n                          \nchangeover  defense may  articulate a  legitimate reason  for\nplaintiff's reassignment.   However,  it makes no  attempt to\nexplain why the reorganization took place along the political\nlines  alleged  by  plaintiff.    Accordingly,  there  remain\ngenuine  issues  of  material fact  as  to  whether the  1985\nreorganization was pretextual.  See id. at 1221-22.\n                                       \n     Moreover,   in  presenting  us   with  their  changeover\nargument, defendants do  not deny or  attempt to explain  why\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.  The Due Process Clause\n                          \n\n          Plaintiff's  final  argument is  that  the district\n\ncourt erred  in granting  defendants summary judgment  on his\n\nclaim,  as  set  forth   generally  in  his  complaint,  that\n\n\"plaintiff's  property interests are being adversely affected\n\nby defendants['] actions . . . in  violation of [plaintiff's]\n\nrights  to due  process under  the Fourteenth Amendment.  . .\n\n.\"10  We disagree with plaintiff's contention.\n\n          Plaintiff's due process claim depends on his having\n\nbeen deprived of a property right without due process of law.\n\nSee Cleveland Bd. of  Educ. v.
