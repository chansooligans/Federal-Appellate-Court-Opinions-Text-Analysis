This sentencing appeal has two  foci.  We\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\nconsider each in turn.\n\n          First, defendant-appellant Carlos Daniel Rosa-Hernandez\n\nclaims that the  district court erred in refusing to treat him as\n\na minor player in  the offense of conviction (a  drug-trafficking\n\ncrime).    See U.S.S.G.     3B1.2(b) (providing  for  a two-level\n              \n\nreduction in the  applicable offense level if the  defendant is a\n\nminor participant).   Absent  mistake of law,  we review  a trial\n\njudge's  role-in-the-offense  assessments only  for  clear error.\n\nSee United  States v. Garcia,  954 F.2d  12, 18 (1st  Cir. 1992);\n                            \n\nUnited States v.  Akitoye, 923 F.2d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1991).  We\n                         \n\napproach  this  task  mindful that,  \"[a]s  with  other sentence-\n\ndecreasing adjustments, a  defendant must shoulder the  burden of\n\nproving  his   entitlement  to  a   downward  role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment.\"  United  States v. Ocasio-Rivera, No.  92-2100, slip\n                                             \n\nop. at 5 (1st Cir. April 1, 1993).\n\n          Appellant did  not challenge the  factual underpinnings\n\nof the presentence  investigation report.   From the contents  of\n\nthat report, the district court could permissibly have found that\n\nappellant actively  participated in a  meeting on April  16, 1992\n\nwith  his cohort,  Miguel Rodriguez-Gonzalez, and  a confidential\n\ninformant (who was acting as  an internuncio for the  prospective\n\npurchaser, a government  agent); that, when the  undercover agent\n\njoined the  trio, appellant made  it clear  that he did  not want\n\nanybody to  see his (appellant's)  face; that, after the  men had\n\nshooed the purchaser  away, the informant emerged  from a further\n\n                                2\n\nmeeting  with appellant  and  Rodriguez-Gonzalez,  met  with  the\n\nagent,  and gave him  instructions, attributed to  appellant, for\n\ndelivery of  the purchase  money to a  specific site  (a shopping\n\ncenter);  that,  thereafter,   appellant  transported  Rodriguez-\n\nGonzalez  and the  informant  to the  shopping  center, where  he\n\nintroduced the informant to Julio Gomez-Gonzalez; and that, later\n\nthe same afternoon,  the informant and   Gomez-Gonzalez attempted\n\nto consummate the sale of  five kilograms of cocaine for $85,000.\n\nAt  the time of the  arrest, appellant was  still at the shopping\n\ncenter, standing  by his truck, and  (or so the court  could have\n\nfound)  either overseeing  or  keeping  watch  to  safeguard  the\n\ntransaction.\n\n          To  be sure,  appellant  was  not  a  direct,  hands-on\n\nparticipant  at the  time of  sale.   Nevertheless, based  on the\n\nfacts recounted  above, the  lower court  supportably could  have\n\nfound  that appellant was  a full-fledged player  in the venture.\n\nIn  short, given,  especially, the  burden  of proof,  we do  not\n\nbelieve that the court was legally required to accept appellant's\n\nself-serving claim  that he  was a  minor participant.   Compare,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Ocasio-Rivera, slip op. at 5-7; United States v. Ortiz, 966\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 707,  717 (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,  113 S.

Rosado-Sierra,  938 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991) (per  curiam); United States  v. Osorio, 929 F.2d  753, 764\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1991);  United States v.  Cepeda, 907 F.2d 11,  12 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1990).   In  the  final analysis,  when  there are  several\n\n                                3\n\nplausible views of  the record, \"the sentencing  court's adoption\n\nof one such view cannot be  clearly erroneous.\"  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSt. Cyr,  977 F.2d 698, 706  (1st Cir. 1992).   So it is  in this\n       \n\ncase.\n\n          Appellant's remaining  asseveration is  no more  hardy.\n\nHe  claims that,  as part  of  a plea  agreement, the  government\n\npromised that it  would \"not oppose [his] request  for a downward\n\nadjustment for his role in the offense,\" Appellant's Brief at 11,\n\nbut  reneged on the promise.  The problems with this argument are\n\nmany     and  they  are insurmountable.    The  most  fundamental\n\ndifficulty is the ephemeral nature of the alleged agreement:  the\n\nrecord does not contain  a whisper of a hint of  an intimation of\n\nthe supposed promise.   Moreover, appellant, who  was represented\n\nat all times by able counsel, did not assert the existence of any\n\nsuch promise in the written petition that accompanied his request\n\nto  the district  court for  permission to  plead guilty,  in the\n\ncolloquy that  transpired during the change-of-plea  hearing, see\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R.  Crim.  P.  11,  or  in his  written  objections  to  the\n\npresentence report.  In point of fact, on the first two  of these\n\noccasions,  appellant explicitly  denied  that any  promises, not\n\npreviously disclosed, had been made to him.  \n\n          We  see  no  reason  to  look  behind  appellant's  own\n\nstatements.   We have repeatedly refused to imply plea agreements\n\nor plea agreement  provisions out of thin air,  see, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir.  1992); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Atwood,  963 F.2d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1992); Garcia, 954\n                                                            \n\n                                4\n\nF.2d  at 17;  United States v.  Hogan, 862 F.2d  386, 388-89 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1988), and  we adhere to  that view today.   If there  was a\n\npromise   and we emphasize that we have found no sign of one   it\n\nshould have been made known to  the district court no later  than\n\nthe date of the Rule 11 hearing, not kept hidden amidst counsel's\n\nor defendant's  unspoken reveries.   See Garcia,  954 F.2d  at 17\n                                               \n\nn.3; Hogan, 862 F.2d at 389 n.4.\n          \n\n          The upshot is  that appellant has no case.   Because it\n\nclearly appears  that Rosa-Hernandez  was lawfully  sentenced and\n\nthat his appeal  presents no substantial question, we  need go no\n\nfurther.  See 1st Cir. Loc.R. 27.1.\n             \n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                5\n\n                                6\n",

In  the  final analysis,  when  there are  several\n\n                                3\n\nplausible views of  the record, \"the sentencing  court's adoption\n\nof one such view cannot be  clearly erroneous.\"  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSt. Cyr,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706  (1st Cir. 1992).   So it is  in this\n       \n\ncase.\n\n          Appellant's remaining  asseveration is  no more  hardy.\n\nHe  claims that,  as part  of  a plea  agreement, the  government\n\npromised that it  would \"not oppose [his] request  for a downward\n\nadjustment for his role in the offense,\" Appellant's Brief at 11,\n\nbut  reneged on the promise.  The problems with this argument are\n\nmany     and  they  are insurmountable.    The  most  fundamental\n\ndifficulty is the ephemeral nature of the alleged agreement:  the\n\nrecord does not contain  a whisper of a hint of  an intimation of\n\nthe supposed promise.   Moreover, appellant, who  was represented\n\nat all times by able counsel, did not assert the existence of any\n\nsuch promise in the written petition that accompanied his request\n\nto  the district  court for  permission to  plead guilty,  in the\n\ncolloquy that  transpired during the change-of-plea  hearing, see\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R.  Crim.  P.  11,  or  in his  written  objections  to  the\n\npresentence report.  In point of fact, on the first two  of these\n\noccasions,  appellant explicitly  denied  that any  promises, not\n\npreviously disclosed, had been made to him.  \n\n          We  see  no  reason  to  look  behind  appellant's  own\n\nstatements.   We have repeatedly refused to imply plea agreements\n\nor plea agreement  provisions out of thin air,  see, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

If there  was a\n\npromise   and we emphasize that we have found no sign of one   it\n\nshould have been made known to  the district court no later  than\n\nthe date of the Rule 11 hearing, not kept hidden amidst counsel's\n\nor defendant's  unspoken reveries.

Because it\n\nclearly appears  that Rosa-Hernandez  was lawfully  sentenced and\n\nthat his appeal  presents no substantial question, we  need go no\n\nfurther.  See 1st Cir.
