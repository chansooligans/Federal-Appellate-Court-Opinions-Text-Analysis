Esvin Anibal Reyes Beteta, a\n\nGuatemalan national, petitions for review of an order of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an immigration judge's (IJ)\n\ndecision to deny his application for withholding of removal.                        The\n\npetition is denied.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             Reyes     entered    the     United          States      illegally      in\n\napproximately May 2002.          Removal proceedings against him were\n\ninitiated through a Notice to Appear on May 24, 2005, charging him\n\nwith entering the United States without inspection.                    See 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง    1182(a)(6)(A)(i).        Reyes   conceded          removability        but   sought\n\nwithholding of removal.1\n\n             Reyes's   testimony,     which       the    IJ   found    credible      for\n\npurposes of rendering a decision, may be briefly summarized.\n\nReyes, born in October 1983, testified that he was a young child\n\nduring the Guatemalan civil war in the 1980s.                 During that time two\n\nof    his   cousins    were   murdered       by   armed       men,    and    an   uncle\n\ndisappeared.     In addition, guerillas took some of his parents'\n\nland, placing the family in fear and causing them to work their\n\nfarmland during the day and sleep in nearby mountains at night.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Reyes also sought asylum, which the IJ denied as a matter of\nlaw after finding that Reyes's untimely filing was not excused by\nchanged or extraordinary circumstances.     The BIA affirmed that\ndecision, and the petitioner has not pursued his asylum claim here.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            Reyes left his village in 1997 and moved to Guatemala\n\nCity, where he worked as a street vendor for two years.       During\n\nthis time, he was harassed by gang members who would steal his\n\ngoods and money, but they did not steal from those who paid them\n\noff.   He later worked in a store in Guatemala City.   He returned to\n\nhis village in December 2001, after gang members attempted to rob\n\nthe store, threatened him when he defended the store, and later\n\nreturned to look for him in retaliation for his efforts.          He\n\nremained at his family's farm until he came to the United States in\n\nMay 2002.\n\n            Reyes testified that since he has been in the United\n\nStates, family members in Guatemala have told him that they have\n\nbeen threatened and harassed because gang members knew that he was\n\nliving and working in the United States.   He also testified that he\n\nfears that he will be killed by gang members or ex-guerillas if he\n\nreturns to Guatemala because he resisted them while in Guatemala\n\nCity and because he will be presumed to have money based on his\n\ntime in the United States.   Reyes also testified that there is no\n\nsafe place for him in Guatemala, as the police do not protect poor\n\npeople from gang violence.     Neither Reyes nor his family ever\n\nreported any of their violent interactions to police because, he\n\ntestified, the police were corrupt and fearful of stopping gang\n\nactivity.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            At the conclusion of the hearing the IJ denied Reyes's\n\napplication on the grounds that he had failed to establish either\n\npast persecution or a threat of persecution if he returned to\n\nGuatemala.     The IJ found that Reyes's treatment in Guatemala did\n\nnot rise to the level of persecution, but was instead the by-\n\nproduct   of   gang    members'      motivation    to    enrich   themselves     by\n\nstealing.\n\n            Similarly, the IJ found that Reyes failed to show that he\n\nwould be unable to avoid similar confrontations upon returning to\n\nGuatemala, noting that Reyes was unharmed after he returned from\n\nGuatemala City to his parents' farm.           Moreover, to the extent that\n\nReyes would, as he feared, be targeted upon his return, the\n\nmotivation for such hostility would again be monetary gain.                    The\n\napplication      for   withholding     of   removal     was   therefore   denied,\n\nalthough Reyes's request for voluntary departure was granted.\n\n            Reyes appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision on essentially the same grounds relied upon by the IJ.\n\nThe BIA first found that Reyes had failed to demonstrate that he\n\nhad been persecuted in the past, both because he did not recall\n\nthat he suffered any difficulties personally that rose to the level\n\nof persecution, and because the theft and extortion that took place\n\nin   Guatemala    City   did   not    constitute      persecution   based   on   a\n\nprotected ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f              The BIA also rejected Reyes's claim that he would be\n\npersecuted upon his return to Guatemala based on his status as a\n\nGuatemalan returning from the United States.                The BIA found that\n\ngang members and ex-guerillas would target anyone who might be a\n\npotential source of money or valuables, and would not limit their\n\ncriminal activity to Guatemalans returning from the United States.\n\nThe   BIA    also    found   that    Reyes's   opposition    to   the   criminal\n\nactivities of gangs and ex-guerillas is not a form of political\n\nopinion protected by immigration laws.              This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              When the BIA has adopted an IJ's ruling, but has also\n\nexamined some of the IJ's conclusions, we review both the BIA's and\n\nIJ's opinions.         Matovu v. Holder, 577 F.3d 383, 386 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).      Our scope of review is limited.         We appraise the BIA's and\n\nIJ's findings of fact under the \"substantial evidence\" standard,\n\naccepting them as long as they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"      Sharari v. Gonzalez, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nWe review the BIA's legal determinations de novo, albeit according\n\n\"substantial        deference   to    the   BIA's    interpretations    of   the\n\nunderlying statutes and regulations according to administrative law\n\nprinciples.\"        Scatambuli v. Holder, 558 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            To be eligible for withholding of removal, Reyes must\n\nshow    either   that    he   has   suffered   past   persecution     due   to   a\n\nstatutorily      protected      ground,      thus   creating     a   rebuttable\n\npresumption that he may suffer future persecution upon return to\n\nGuatemala; or he must demonstrate a clear probability that he will\n\nbe persecuted on account of a protected ground when he returns.\n\nLopez-Castro v. Holder, 577 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing Da\n\nSilva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir 2005)).              The statutorily\n\nprotected grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, and political opinion.              Lopez-Castro, 577\n\nF.3d at 52; 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(b)(1).\n\n            To qualify as persecution, a petitioner's experience\n\n\"must    rise    above   unpleasantness,       harassment,     and   even   basic\n\nsuffering.\"      Decky v. Holder, 587 F.3d 104, 110 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nMoreover, \"[p]ersecution, within the context of the immigration\n\nstatutes, does not include all treatment that our society regards\n\nas unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\"                    Id.\n\n(quoting Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\n            The record supports the BIA's conclusion regarding both\n\npast and future persecution.           While the abduction and murder of\n\nReyes's cousins and uncle prior to his arrival in the United States\n\nis disturbing, the record supports the BIA's conclusion that Reyes\n\nfailed to establish that his past hardships rose to the level of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpersecution.2       It is undisputed that he witnessed none of the\n\nviolence, does not remember his uncle or cousins, and does not\n\nremember hiding in the mountains.              He testified that his family\n\n\"suspects\" that guerillas -- now gang members -- were behind his\n\nrelatives' deaths.          Thus, even if we were to assume that the\n\nkillings constituted persecution against Reyes, \"[w]ithout knowing\n\nwho was responsible for the killings or what had prompted them, it\n\nis no more than a guess that a nexus existed between the deaths and\n\na statutorily protected ground.\"             Lopez-Castro, 577 F.3d at 52.\n\n            As to the probability of future persecution, we first\n\nnote that Reyes acknowledged in his testimony that the guerillas\n\nare no longer a force in Guatemala.            This blunts most of the impact\n\nof his claim of future persecution. The petitioner asserts that he\n\nis part of protected social groups consisting of \"Guatemalan street\n\nvendors who have resisted gangs,\" \"expatriates returning from\n\nworking in the United States and are perceived to have wealth,\" and\n\n\"Guatemalans whose families have resisted the guerillas.\"                 But the\n\ntestimony is clear that the gang action was in no way a targeted\n\nactivity; it was instead a widespread form of organized extortion.\n\nWe   have   held   that    a    \"risk   of   victimization   through    economic\n\nterrorism    is    not    the   functional     equivalent    of   a   statutorily\n\nprotected ground . . . .\"          Lopez-Castro, 577 F.3d at 54; see also\n\n\n      2\n      Reyes does not challenge the BIA's conclusion that the theft\nof his money and goods while he worked as a street vendor did not\nconstitute persecution.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fRuiz v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 31, 37 (finding that threats motivated by\n\ngreed do not implicate a protected ground); Lopez de Hincapie v.\n\nGonzalez, 494 F.3d 213, 219-220 (1st Cir. 2007) (common criminals'\n\nattempts to extort money not connected to protected ground).\n\nFinally, Reyes also testified that the gangs that robbed him in\n\nGuatemala City did not follow him back to his parents' farm when he\n\nreturned there, because he \"was already a grown up, not like six\n\nyears before.\"   This suggests that at most, while Reyes was an easy\n\ntarget as a youth, adulthood has lessened his vulnerability to the\n\npoint where future victimization is far from probable.\n\n          Against this legal and factual backdrop, we have little\n\ntrouble affirming the decision of the BIA. The petition for review\n\nis therefore denied.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given the basis for our disposition, we need not address\nReyes's argument that the BIA improperly employed a \"social\nvisibility\" test in determining whether any of Reyes's proposed\ngroups constitute a \"social group\" within the meaning of the\nimmigration laws. See Mendez-Barrera v. Holder, 602 F.3d 21, 25-27\n(1st Cir. 2010). In any event, we have explicitly affirmed the\nrelevance of the social visibility inquiry to social group\nanalysis. Faye v. Holder, 580 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

While the abduction and murder of\n\nReyes's cousins and uncle prior to his arrival in the United States\n\nis disturbing, the record supports the BIA's conclusion that Reyes\n\nfailed to establish that his past hardships rose to the level of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpersecution.2       It is undisputed that he witnessed none of the\n\nviolence, does not remember his uncle or cousins, and does not\n\nremember hiding in the mountains.              He testified that his family\n\n\"suspects\" that guerillas -- now gang members -- were behind his\n\nrelatives' deaths.          Thus, even if we were to assume that the\n\nkillings constituted persecution against Reyes, \"[w]ithout knowing\n\nwho was responsible for the killings or what had prompted them, it\n\nis no more than a guess that a nexus existed between the deaths and\n\na statutorily protected ground.\"             Lopez-Castro, 577 F.3d at 52.\n\n            As to the probability of future persecution, we first\n\nnote that Reyes acknowledged in his testimony that the guerillas\n\nare no longer a force in Guatemala.            This blunts most of the impact\n\nof his claim of future persecution. The petitioner asserts that he\n\nis part of protected social groups consisting of \"Guatemalan street\n\nvendors who have resisted gangs,\" \"expatriates returning from\n\nworking in the United States and are perceived to have wealth,\" and\n\n\"Guatemalans whose families have resisted the guerillas.\"                 But the\n\ntestimony is clear that the gang action was in no way a targeted\n\nactivity; it was instead a widespread form of organized extortion.\n\nWe   have   held   that    a    \"risk   of   victimization   through    economic\n\nterrorism    is    not    the   functional     equivalent    of   a   statutorily\n\nprotected ground . . . .\"          Lopez-Castro, 577 F.3d at 54; see also\n\n\n      2\n      Reyes does not challenge the BIA's conclusion that the theft\nof his money and goods while he worked as a street vendor did not\nconstitute persecution.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fRuiz v.

The petition for review\n\nis therefore denied.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given the basis for our disposition, we need not address\nReyes's argument that the BIA improperly employed a \"social\nvisibility\" test in determining whether any of Reyes's proposed\ngroups constitute a \"social group\" within the meaning of the\nimmigration laws.
