On October 19, 1987, Southworth\n                          \n\nMachinery, Inc. (\"Southworth\") filed in the district court an\n\nadmiralty  suit in  rem against  the vessel  F/V Corey  Pride\n                       \n\n(\"Corey Pride\") and in personam against All Trawl, Inc. (\"All\n                               \n\nTrawl\"),  Robert  Anderson, and  James  Corey  for breach  of\n\ncontract.   All Trawl  is a Massachusetts  commercial fishing\n\ncorporation which owns  the Corey Pride  and Anderson is  All\n\nTrawl's president.  James Corey is identified in Southworth's\n\ncomplaint as either an agent or principal of All Trawl.  \n\n     Southworth sought to recover a balance of $12,148.28 due\n\nfor  its assembly  and installation  of a  refurbished diesel\n\nengine  for the  Corey  Pride pursuant  to  an oral  contract\n\nbetween itself and  Anderson.  Shortly  after the engine  was\n\ninstalled  on the  vessel by  a Southworth  employee, a  fire\n\nbroke out  on the Corey  Pride while it was  out at sea  on a\n\nfishing expedition.   Claiming  that the  fire was caused  by\n\ndefective  engine parts  and faulty  installation, defendants\n\nCorey  Pride,  All Trawl,  and  Anderson filed  counterclaims\n\nagainst Southworth for breach  of contract, breach of express\n\nand  implied  warranties,  and breach  of  the  Massachusetts\n\nConsumer  Protection Act,  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 93A  (\"chapter\n\n93A\").  An additional claim for negligence was later asserted\n\nat trial.  \n\n     Southworth's  claims against  Anderson  and James  Corey\n\nwere dismissed  without  objection  prior to  trial.    As  a\n\n                             -2-\n\nresult,  James  Corey  was out  of  the  case altogether  and\n\nAnderson continued only as  a counterclaimant.  The remaining\n\nclaims were tried in December  1990 before a magistrate judge\n\nby  consent of the  parties.   28 U.S.C.    636(c).    At the\n\nconclusion  of the  trial,  the magistrate  judge found  that\n\nSouthworth had  breached express and implied  warranties, its\n\nduty of care, and chapter 93A in connection with its sale and\n\ninstallation of  the engine,  and that these  breaches caused\n\nthe  fire   aboard  the  Corey  Pride.     Specifically,  the\n\nmagistrate  judge  found  that  the  fire  was  caused  by  a\n\ndefective makeshift oil pressure line connected to the engine\n\nand installed by Southworth's agent.   All Trawl and Anderson\n\nwere awarded  $38,509 in  damages together with  interest and\n\ncosts.\n\n     The magistrate judge declined to  award multiple damages\n\nunder chapter 93A  for willful or  knowing violations of  the\n\nstatute.    The  magistrate  judge  also  declined  to  award\n\nattorney's fees  to All Trawl and Anderson under chapter 93A,\n\nconcluding  that such  an award  would conflict  with general\n\nfederal maritime law  under which the parties bear  their own\n\nlegal  fees.    Lastly,  the magistrate  judge held  that All\n\nTrawl was liable to Southworth for the $12,148.28 balance due\n\nunder  the contract  for the  purchase of  the engine,  which\n\n                             -3-\n\nremained in workable condition  after the fire and  which the\n\nCorey Pride continued to use.1\n\n     Judgment  was entered  by separate  order on  January 3,\n\n1992.   In this appeal,  All Trawl and  Anderson contend that\n\nthe magistrate  judge erred  in disallowing multiple  damages\n\nand attorney's  fees  and  in  holding All  Trawl  liable  to\n\nSouthworth for the  balance due under  the purchase and  sale\n\ncontract.   Southworth has not appealed  the judgment against\n\nit.\n\n     We  address  at the  outset  a  question concerning  our\n\nappellate  jurisdiction.     The  judgment  entered   by  the\n\nmagistrate on  January 3, 1992,  did not formally  dispose of\n\nall of the  claims against all of the parties.   See  Fed. R.\n                                                    \n\nCiv.  P. 54(b).  Accordingly,  this court issued  an order to\n\nthe  parties  raising  the  subject of  our  jurisdiction  to\n\nconsider this appeal.   Southworth responded with a motion to\n\ndismiss  the  appeal,  contending  that the  judgment  was  a\n\nnonfinal and hence unappealable order.  See 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n                                           \n\n     Our subsequent  review of  the record has  revealed that\n\ncertain  claims  omitted from  the  January  3 judgment  were\n\ndismissed prior to trial  and others were disposed of  in the\n\nmagistrate judge's written decision.  The \"separate document\"\n\n                    \n\n     1The magistrate judge also held that Anderson was liable\nfor the balance of the  purchase price.  At oral argument  in\nthis  court, Southworth  conceded that  the judgment  against\nAnderson was incorrect since  all claims against Anderson had\nbeen dismissed before trial.\n\n                             -4-\n\nrule does  not defeat  appellate jurisdiction where  a timely\n\nappeal is filed and  the parties do not suffer  any prejudice\n\nfrom the absence of a  separate document entering judgment on\n\nclaims  that were  clearly disposed of  in an  earlier order.\n\nSmith v.  Massachussetts Dep't of Correction,  936 F.2d 1390,\n                                            \n\n1393-94   (1st   Cir.   1991);      Smith-Bey   v.   Hospital\n                                                             \n\nAdministrator, 841 F.2d 751, 756 (7th Cir. 1988).\n             \n\n     The  only seemingly  unresolved  matter that  may be  of\n\nlingering  interest to  the  parties is  Southworth's in  rem\n                                                             \n\nclaim against the  Corey Pride  under a maritime  lien.   The\n\nmagistrate judge's opinion did  not explicitly address the in\n                                                             \n\nrem  claim.  However, under  28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(3), we have\n   \n\njurisdiction over interlocutory decrees in admiralty cases as\n\nlong as the order appealed from finally determines the rights\n\nand  liabilities of  the  parties on  a  particular claim  or\n\nissue.   See  Martha's Vineyard  Scuba Headquarters,  Inc. v.\n                                                          \n\nUnidentified,  Wrecked &amp;  Abandoned  Steam Vessel,  833  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1059,  1062-64 (1st Cir. 1987).  Since the claims involved in\n\nthis  appeal were  conclusively  decided  by  the  magistrate\n\njudge, we have jurisdiction over them.  \n\n     Turning  to  the  merits,  we  affirm  the  magistrate's\n\ndisallowance of multiple damages under chapter 93A.   Section\n\n11 of chapter 93A governing business disputes provides for up\n\nto three times the  amount of actual damages for  \"willful or\n\nknowing\" violations  of section 2, which  prohibits unfair or\n\n                             -5-\n\ndeceptive trade  practices.2  Anderson and  All Trawl premise\n\ntheir claim  for multiple damages on  Southworth's failure to\n\nadequately  investigate the cause of  the fire and  to make a\n\nreasonable   settlement  offer.     This  failure   to  fully\n\ninvestigate, say  Anderson and  All Trawl, constituted  a bad\n\nfaith response to their demand for relief under chapter 93A.\n\n     It  is unclear  whether section  11 permits  recovery of\n\nmultiple damages  under  such a  theory  where bad  faith  is\n\nproved.   Section 9  provides for  multiple  damages where  a\n\ndemand is refused in bad faith, but section 9 is by its terms\n\ninapplicable (see note 2,  above) and section 11 has  no such\n                                \n\ncounterpart language.  Massachusetts case  law is murky as to\n\nwhether  the bad  faith  refusal  concept  can be  read  into\n\nsection 11.  Glickman v. Brown, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 238 n.\n                              \n\n7, 486 N.E.2d 737, 743 n. 7 (1985), expressly holds  that the\n\nbad faith  response provision \"has no  application\" to claims\n\ngoverned by section 11.  On the other hand, the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial  Court has  employed language that  may look\n\n                    \n\n     2Section 11  applies to claims brought  by \"[a]ny person\nwho engages in  the conduct of any trade or  commerce and who\nsuffers any loss  of money or property  . . . as  a result of\n[unfair  competition or  unfair  or deceptive  practices]  by\nanother person  who engages in any trade or commerce . . . .\"\nMass.  Gen.  L. ch.  93A,     11.   Section  9,  which has  a\ndifferent  multiple  damage   provision,  applies  to  \"[a]ny\nperson, other than a person entitled to bring an action under\nsection eleven  of this chapter  . . .  .\"  Mass. Gen.  L. ch\n93A,   9(1).  There is no question that the parties here were\nacting in a  business context.  At trial,  Anderson testified\nthat he purchased the engine for business reasons.\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe other way.   International Fidelity  Ins. Co. v.  Wilson,\n                                                            \n\n387 Mass. 841, 857, 443 N.E.2d 1308, 1318 (1983). \n\n     We  need not  pursue  the issue  because the  magistrate\n\njudge  found that Southworth did not act  in bad faith.   The\n\nmagistrate  judge agreed  that Southworth  did not  conduct a\n\nfull investigation  of the accident when  rejecting liability\n\nbut found that this  was due to its reasonable  belief, after\n\nsome  amount of investigation, that the cause of the fire was\n\nelectrical.   Shortly  after  receiving notice  of the  fire,\n\nSouthworth sent its employee who had  installed the engine to\n\ninvestigate.   The employee did not observe any problems with\n\nthe  engine and reported that the fire was possibly caused by\n\nan electrical  failure.   An electrician not  associated with\n\nSouthworth had installed temporary  wiring on the Corey Pride\n\ndays before the fire broke out.\n\n     All  Trawl's own investigator  determined that  the fire\n\nwas  caused by oil leaks  from the engine  but Southworth not\n\nsurprisingly  chose  to rely  on  its employee's  assessment.\n\nBased on  this evidence  the magistrate judge  concluded that\n\nSouthworth's  belief that it was not responsible for the fire\n\nwas  \"not  unfounded,\"  and   thus  its  failure  to  conduct\n\nadditional  investigation did  not warrant  multiple damages.\n\nThe magistrate  judge's finding  is supported by  the record,\n\nhas not  been challenged on  appeal, and  therefore ends  the\n\nmatter.  \n\n                             -7-\n\n     We also affirm the magistrate judge's determination that\n\nAll  Trawl is liable for  the unpaid portion  of the purchase\n\nprice of the  engine.  Because the engine was  not damaged by\n\nthe  fire  aside from  some  minor paint  peeling,  All Trawl\n\ndecided to  keep the engine for  use on the Corey  Pride.  At\n\ntrial, Anderson  testified that the  engine was still  in use\n\nand that he was satisfied with its operation.   Under section\n\n2-607  of the Uniform  Commercial Code,3 a  buyer who accepts\n\ngoods is  liable for the  contract price, although  the buyer\n\nmay recover damages resulting  from any defect.   4 Anderson,\n\nUniform Commercial Code    2-607:15 (3d ed. 1983); Micromedia\n                                                             \n\nv.

The  magistrate judge found  that\n\nthe  predominant purpose of  the contract  was to  provide an\n\nengine and that the supply of labor was only incidental.  See\n                                                             \n\nCambridge  Plating Co.,  Inc.  v.

In any event, by\n\nretaining  the engine and obtaining damages for the harm done\n\nthrough misinstallation,  All Trawl has been  restored to the\n\nposition  it  would  have  been  in  had  the  contract  been\n\nperformed.  This  is the  general aim of  suits for  contract\n\ndamages, Farnsworth, Contracts   12.8, at 871 (2d  ed. 1990),\n                              \n\nand there  is no reason why  All Trawl should be  placed in a\n\nposition  even   better  than  it  would   have  obtained  if\n\nSouthworth had flawlessly performed the original contract.  \n\n     The  remaining  issue  concerns  attorney's  fees  under\n\nchapter  93A.   Prevailing  claimants under  chapter 93A  are\n\nordinarily  entitled to  recover  reasonable attorney's  fees\n\nincurred  in connection  with the chapter  93A claim.   Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 93A,   11.   Although finding that Southworth had\n\nbreached chapter 93A, the  magistrate judge declined to award\n\nattorney's  fees.  She  reasoned  that such  an  award  would\n\nconflict with  federal maritime  law under which  the parties\n\npay their  own fees absent bad faith or oppressive litigation\n\ntactics. See Templeman  v. Chris Craft  Corp., 770 F.2d  245,\n                                             \n\n250 (1st Cir.) cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1021 (1985); Goodman v.\n                                                          \n\n1973 26 Foot Trojan Vessel, 859 F.2d 71, 74 (8th Cir. 1988).\n                          \n\n     Under  the  \"saving  to  suitors\" clause,  28  U.S.C.   \n\n1331(1), claimants in an admiralty case are not restricted to\n\nmaritime  relief but  may  also pursue  remedies provided  by\n\nstate law.  E.g.,  Ellenwood v. Exxon Shipping Co.,  984 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n                             -9-\n\n1270,  1279 (1st Cir. 1993).   However, \"the  extent to which\n\nstate  law  may  be  used  to  remedy  maritime  injuries  is\n\nconstrained  by  a  so-called `reverse-Erie'  doctrine  which\n                                           \n\nrequires that the substantive remedies afforded by the States\n\nconform to governing federal  maritime standards.\"   Offshore\n                                                             \n\nLogistics,  Inc. v.

On October 19, 1987, Southworth\n                          \n\nMachinery, Inc. (\"Southworth\") filed in the district court an\n\nadmiralty  suit in  rem against  the vessel  F/V Corey  Pride\n                       \n\n(\"Corey Pride\") and in personam against All Trawl, Inc. (\"All\n                               \n\nTrawl\"),  Robert  Anderson, and  James  Corey  for breach  of\n\ncontract.   All Trawl  is a Massachusetts  commercial fishing\n\ncorporation which owns  the Corey Pride  and Anderson is  All\n\nTrawl's president.  James Corey is identified in Southworth's\n\ncomplaint as either an agent or principal of All Trawl.  \n\n     Southworth sought to recover a balance of $12,148.28 due\n\nfor  its assembly  and installation  of a  refurbished diesel\n\nengine  for the  Corey  Pride pursuant  to  an oral  contract\n\nbetween itself and  Anderson.  Shortly  after the engine  was\n\ninstalled  on the  vessel by  a Southworth  employee, a  fire\n\nbroke out  on the Corey  Pride while it was  out at sea  on a\n\nfishing expedition.   Claiming  that the  fire was caused  by\n\ndefective  engine parts  and faulty  installation, defendants\n\nCorey  Pride,  All Trawl,  and  Anderson filed  counterclaims\n\nagainst Southworth for breach  of contract, breach of express\n\nand  implied  warranties,  and breach  of  the  Massachusetts\n\nConsumer  Protection Act,  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 93A  (\"chapter\n\n93A\").  An additional claim for negligence was later asserted\n\nat trial.  \n\n     Southworth's  claims against  Anderson  and James  Corey\n\nwere dismissed  without  objection  prior to  trial.    As  a\n\n                             -2-\n\nresult,  James  Corey  was out  of  the  case altogether  and\n\nAnderson continued only as  a counterclaimant.  The remaining\n\nclaims were tried in December  1990 before a magistrate judge\n\nby  consent of the  parties.   28 U.S.C.    636(c).    At the\n\nconclusion  of the  trial,  the magistrate  judge found  that\n\nSouthworth had  breached express and implied  warranties, its\n\nduty of care, and chapter 93A in connection with its sale and\n\ninstallation of  the engine,  and that these  breaches caused\n\nthe  fire   aboard  the  Corey  Pride.     Specifically,  the\n\nmagistrate  judge  found  that  the  fire  was  caused  by  a\n\ndefective makeshift oil pressure line connected to the engine\n\nand installed by Southworth's agent.   All Trawl and Anderson\n\nwere awarded  $38,509 in  damages together with  interest and\n\ncosts.\n\n     The magistrate judge declined to  award multiple damages\n\nunder chapter 93A  for willful or  knowing violations of  the\n\nstatute.    The  magistrate  judge  also  declined  to  award\n\nattorney's fees  to All Trawl and Anderson under chapter 93A,\n\nconcluding  that such  an award  would conflict  with general\n\nfederal maritime law  under which the parties bear  their own\n\nlegal  fees.    Lastly,  the magistrate  judge held  that All\n\nTrawl was liable to Southworth for the $12,148.28 balance due\n\nunder  the contract  for the  purchase of  the engine,  which\n\n                             -3-\n\nremained in workable condition  after the fire and  which the\n\nCorey Pride continued to use.1\n\n     Judgment  was entered  by separate  order on  January 3,\n\n1992.   In this appeal,  All Trawl and  Anderson contend that\n\nthe magistrate  judge erred  in disallowing multiple  damages\n\nand attorney's  fees  and  in  holding All  Trawl  liable  to\n\nSouthworth for the  balance due under  the purchase and  sale\n\ncontract.   Southworth has not appealed  the judgment against\n\nit.\n\n     We  address  at the  outset  a  question concerning  our\n\nappellate  jurisdiction.     The  judgment  entered   by  the\n\nmagistrate on  January 3, 1992,  did not formally  dispose of\n\nall of the  claims against all of the parties.   See  Fed. R.\n                                                    \n\nCiv.  P. 54(b).  Accordingly,  this court issued  an order to\n\nthe  parties  raising  the  subject of  our  jurisdiction  to\n\nconsider this appeal.   Southworth responded with a motion to\n\ndismiss  the  appeal,  contending  that the  judgment  was  a\n\nnonfinal and hence unappealable order.  See 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n                                           \n\n     Our subsequent  review of  the record has  revealed that\n\ncertain  claims  omitted from  the  January  3 judgment  were\n\ndismissed prior to trial  and others were disposed of  in the\n\nmagistrate judge's written decision.  The \"separate document\"\n\n                    \n\n     1The magistrate judge also held that Anderson was liable\nfor the balance of the  purchase price.  At oral argument  in\nthis  court, Southworth  conceded that  the judgment  against\nAnderson was incorrect since  all claims against Anderson had\nbeen dismissed before trial.\n\n                             -4-\n\nrule does  not defeat  appellate jurisdiction where  a timely\n\nappeal is filed and  the parties do not suffer  any prejudice\n\nfrom the absence of a  separate document entering judgment on\n\nclaims  that were  clearly disposed of  in an  earlier order.\n\nSmith v.

Since the claims involved in\n\nthis  appeal were  conclusively  decided  by  the  magistrate\n\njudge, we have jurisdiction over them.  \n\n     Turning  to  the  merits,  we  affirm  the  magistrate's\n\ndisallowance of multiple damages under chapter 93A.   Section\n\n11 of chapter 93A governing business disputes provides for up\n\nto three times the  amount of actual damages for  \"willful or\n\nknowing\" violations  of section 2, which  prohibits unfair or\n\n                             -5-\n\ndeceptive trade  practices.2  Anderson and  All Trawl premise\n\ntheir claim  for multiple damages on  Southworth's failure to\n\nadequately  investigate the cause of  the fire and  to make a\n\nreasonable   settlement  offer.     This  failure   to  fully\n\ninvestigate, say  Anderson and  All Trawl, constituted  a bad\n\nfaith response to their demand for relief under chapter 93A.\n\n     It  is unclear  whether section  11 permits  recovery of\n\nmultiple damages  under  such a  theory  where bad  faith  is\n\nproved.   Section 9  provides for  multiple  damages where  a\n\ndemand is refused in bad faith, but section 9 is by its terms\n\ninapplicable (see note 2,  above) and section 11 has  no such\n                                \n\ncounterpart language.

The\n\nmagistrate  judge agreed  that Southworth  did not  conduct a\n\nfull investigation  of the accident when  rejecting liability\n\nbut found that this  was due to its reasonable  belief, after\n\nsome  amount of investigation, that the cause of the fire was\n\nelectrical.   Shortly  after  receiving notice  of the  fire,\n\nSouthworth sent its employee who had  installed the engine to\n\ninvestigate.   The employee did not observe any problems with\n\nthe  engine and reported that the fire was possibly caused by\n\nan electrical  failure.   An electrician not  associated with\n\nSouthworth had installed temporary  wiring on the Corey Pride\n\ndays before the fire broke out.\n\n     All  Trawl's own investigator  determined that  the fire\n\nwas  caused by oil leaks  from the engine  but Southworth not\n\nsurprisingly  chose  to rely  on  its employee's  assessment.\n\nBased on  this evidence  the magistrate judge  concluded that\n\nSouthworth's  belief that it was not responsible for the fire\n\nwas  \"not  unfounded,\"  and   thus  its  failure  to  conduct\n\nadditional  investigation did  not warrant  multiple damages.\n\nThe magistrate  judge's finding  is supported by  the record,\n\nhas not  been challenged on  appeal, and  therefore ends  the\n\nmatter.  \n\n                             -7-\n\n     We also affirm the magistrate judge's determination that\n\nAll  Trawl is liable for  the unpaid portion  of the purchase\n\nprice of the  engine.  Because the engine was  not damaged by\n\nthe  fire  aside from  some  minor paint  peeling,  All Trawl\n\ndecided to  keep the engine for  use on the Corey  Pride.
