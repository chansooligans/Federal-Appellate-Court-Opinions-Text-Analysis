We consider today a golconda  of\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nchallenges  mined  by defendant-appellant  Paul  J.  Savoie in  a\n\nrelentless  effort  to  ameliorate  a  sentence  imposed  in  the\n\ndistrict  court.  Concluding, as we do, that appellant is digging\n\nin barren soil, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          For several years, appellant led a  double life.  While\n\nserving  as a  policy adviser  to the  mayor of  Pawtucket, Rhode\n\nIsland, he was also part of a trio of high-ranking city officials\n\nwho  systematically  exploited  the  public  trust  for  personal\n\nprofit.  The other  two members of the tarnished troika  were the\n\nmayor, Brian Sarault, see  United States v. Sarault, 975  F.2d 17\n                                                   \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992),  and the  acting public  works  director, Louis\n\nSimon.    Because  of  the  extensive  range  and  reach  of  the\n\ntriumvirate's  illegal  activities,  we  abjure  any  attempt  to\n\ndescribe the plot  at this juncture.  We will,  however, refer to\n\ncertain  relevant  outrages in  connection  with  our canvass  of\n\nappellant's arguments on appeal.\n\n          Savoie  eventually  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of\n\nracketeering, see 18 U.S.C.    1962(c) (1988), and two  counts of\n                 \n\nextortion,  see 18  U.S.C.    1951 (1988).1   At  sentencing, the\n               \n\ndistrict court reviewed the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport), appellant's objections thereto, and transcripts of grand\n\n                    \n\n     1The other twenty-seven counts in the  indictment, including\nnumerous  charges of  attempted extortion,  conspiracy to  commit\nextortion, and  receiving bribes, were dismissed  by agreement at\nthe time of sentencing.\n\n                                2\n\njury testimony  furnished by the government.   Appellant chose to\n\npresent  no independent  evidence (although  he did  rely on  his\n\ndescription of  the offense as  related to the  probation officer\n\nand incorporated in the PSI Report).\n\n          For the most part, the  district court adopted the  PSI\n\nReport's suggested findings.   The court calculated the guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR) at 41-51 months (offense level 22/criminal\n\nhistory  category I) and imposed an incarcerative sentence at the\n\ntop of  the range.  The  court also imposed a  three-year term of\n\nsupervised  release,  a  $7,500   fine,  a  $150  special  felony\n\nassessment, and  150 hours  of community  service.   Finally, the\n\ncourt   ordered  Savoie  to  make  restitution   in  the  sum  of\n\n$93,476.67.  This appeal followed.\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          We  have grouped  appellant's  myriad complaints  under\n\nfour headings.  We discuss them sequentially.\n\n             A.  The Role-in-the-Offense Adjustment.\n                                                   \n\n          The sentencing guidelines  mandate a three-level upward\n\nadjustment if  \"the defendant was a  manager or supervisor .  . .\n\nand the criminal  activity involved five or  more participants or\n\nwas  otherwise  extensive.\"   U.S.S.G.     3B1.1(b) (Nov.  1991).\n\nAppellant claims that the district court erred in relying on this\n\nproviso.   In  this case,  the  criminal activity  was  extensive\n\nenough to satisfy the  guideline.  The only cognizable  question,\n\nthen, is whether the  sentencing court erred in  determining that\n\nappellant was  a manager or  supervisor of the  ring.  Where,  as\n\n                                3\n\nhere,  the sentencing  court's decision  to apply  a role-in-the-\n\noffense adjustment is factbound, we review the determination only\n\nfor clear  error.  See  United States v.  Dietz, 950 F.2d  50, 52\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 48\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862 (1989).\n                        \n\n          In  making  a  role-in-the-offense  determination,  the\n\nsentencing court need not  wear blinders but may look  beyond the\n\ncount  of conviction  to the  whole  of the  defendant's relevant\n\nconduct.   See United States  v. Ruiz-Batista, 956  F.2d 351, 353\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir.),  cert.  denied, 113  S.  Ct.  105  (1992); see  also\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch. 3,  Pt.B, intro.  comment.   Managerial status  may\n\nattach if there is  evidence that a defendant, in  committing the\n\ncrime, exercised  control over, or was  otherwise responsible for\n\noverseeing  the activities of, at  least one other  person.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  United States  v. Veilleux,  949 F.2d  522, 524  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991);  United States  v. Akitoye,  923 F.2d  221, 227  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991);  United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1220-21 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1990).   The evidence of  such control need  not be direct.   See\n                                                                 \n\nDiaz-Villafane,  874  F.2d  at  48  (observing  that  felons  are\n              \n\n\"unlikely  to   make  much   use  of  position   descriptions  or\n\norganizational  charts\").     Where  numerous   participants  are\n\ninvolved, or  the criminal  activity is otherwise  extensive, the\n\ncourt must often make  hierarchical distinctions between those at\n\nthe  very  top  of the  criminal  enterprise  (the  organizers or\n\nleaders)  and   those  who,  while  in   positions  of  executive\n\nauthority,   are  lower  on  the  totem  pole  (the  managers  or\n\n                                4\n\nsupervisors).   In making such fine distinctions,  the indicia of\n\nexecutive status include  such things as the  defendant's role in\n\nrecruiting accomplices, the degree  and nature of the defendant's\n\nparticipation  in  planning  and  implementing  the offense,  the\n\ndefendant's   exercise  of  decisionmaking   authority,  and  the\n\ndefendant's  level of remuneration relative to other participants\n\n(including the  presence or absence of a claimed right to a share\n\nof  the crime's fruits).   See U.S.S.G.    3B1.1, comment. (n.3);\n                              \n\nsee also United  States v. Sostre,  967 F.2d 728,  733 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992);  United States  v. Panet-Collazo, 960  F.2d 256,  261 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 220 (1992).\n                   \n\n          Here,  the record is fairly bursting  at the seams with\n\nevidence  buttressing the  inference  of managerial  status.   In\n\naddition to  extorting funds himself, appellant used internuncios\n\n(e.g., Joseph Stifano, Robert Langlois) as conduits for obtaining\n     \n\nbribes;2 manipulated Pawtucket's highway  director (Ron Lieto) in\n\norder  to extract  free services  for  himself from  a contractor\n\ndoing business with  the City; gave occasional  directions to his\n\nfellow triumvir, Louis  Simon; and, in  general, as the  district\n\njudge  aptly put  it,  \"made some  rather significant  decisions,\n\nincluding the decision of  how much [would be demanded]  and from\n\nwhom [it would be extorted].\"\n\n          We are  completely unmoved by appellant's  plea that he\n\n                    \n\n     2The RICO count to which appellant pleaded described twenty-\nfour separate  racketeering acts.   Act No.  17, described  infra\n                                                                 \nnote  6,  is  an excellent  example  of  how  appellant used  go-\nbetweens.\n\n                                5\n\nwas merely a footsoldier  in Mayor Sarault's iniquitous army.   A\n\ndefendant  need not be the  highest ranking member  of a criminal\n\ntroupe in  order  to be  a manager  or supervisor.   Indeed,  the\n\napplicable  guideline provision  stresses  that  managerial  role\n\nadjustments,  as  opposed  to  other  upward  role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustments,   apply   to  defendants   who   were  managers   or\n\nsupervisors,  but  not organizers  or  leaders.   See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n\n3B1.1(b).  In  other words, Sarault's acknowledged status  as the\n\ncommander-in-chief  is not  in  any sense  inconsistent with  the\n\ncourt's finding that  appellant was his  lieutenant.  See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.  Iguaran-Palmar, 926  F.2d 7, 10  n.1 (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1991).\n\n          We  will not  paint the  lily.   Appellant was  a prime\n\nmover in a pervasive pattern of municipal  corruption lasting for\n\nseveral years.  He  gave orders, participated in setting  policy,\n\nmade decisions, and shared handsomely in the booty.  The evidence\n\nhere is  more  than sufficient  to  ground the  district  court's\n\nfinding that appellant served the  ring in a managerial capacity.\n\nSee  United States v. St. Cyr, 977  F.2d 698, 706 (1st Cir. 1992)\n                             \n\n(holding  that \"when there are two plausible views of the record,\n\nthe sentencing  court's  adoption  of  one such  view  cannot  be\n\nclearly  erroneous\"); Diaz-Villafane,  874 F.2d  at 49  (similar;\n                                    \n\ndiscussing role-in-the-offense adjustments).\n\n                    B.  The Restitution Order.\n                                             \n\n          As part of  the Victim  and Witness  Protection Act  of\n\n1982 (VWPA),  Congress authorized  district courts to  order that\n\n                                6\n\nconvicted defendants make restitution to victims.  See 18  U.S.C.\n                                                      \n\n     3556,  3663,  3664  (1988  &amp;  Supp.  1990).3    The  federal\n\nsentencing  guidelines  themselves require  such  orders  in many\n\ncircumstances.    See U.S.S.G.    5E1.1.    In this  instance the\n                     \n\ndistrict  court  ordered  restitution,  directing  that appellant\n\nrepay,  in  installments,  a  total of  $93,476.67.4    Appellant\n\nattacks the order on three grounds.  He is shooting blanks.\n\n          1.    The Computation.    The  VWPA  provides that,  in\n          1.    The Computation.\n                               \n\ndetermining  the  size  of  a restitution  order,  a  court  must\n\nconsider, among  other things, \"the amount of  the loss sustained\n\nby any victim as a result of the offense.\"  18 U.S.C.    3664(a).\n\nWhen  this amount is disputed, the government bears the burden of\n\nestablishing  it  by a  preponderance of  the  evidence.   See 18\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.    3664(d).   Because  a determination  of victim  loss is\n\nfact-intensive,  we review it only  for clear error.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Teehee, 893 F.2d 271, 273-75 (10th Cir. 1990).\n                \n\n          The  law cannot  be blind  to  the fact  that criminals\n\nrarely keep detailed records of their lawless dealings, totalling\n\nup  every column  and  accounting for  every misbegotten  dollar.\n\nHence, the preponderance standard must be applied in a practical,\n\ncommon-sense   way.    So  long  as   the  basis  for  reasonable\n\napproximation  is  at  hand,   difficulties  in  achieving  exact\n\n                    \n\n     3Until November 1, 1986, the last two of these sections were\ncodified at 18 U.S.C.    3579 &amp; 3580, respectively.\n\n     4Of  this amount, $89,876.67  represented restitution to the\nCity of Pawtucket while  the remainder represented restitution to\nother victims.  Savoie does not challenge the latter component of\nthe restitution order.\n\n                                7\n\nmeasurements  will  not  preclude  a trial  court  from  ordering\n\nrestitution.  See United  States v. Hand, 863 F.2d 1100, 1104 (3d\n                                        \n\nCir. 1988);  see also S. Rep.  No. 532, 97th Cong.,  2d Sess. 31,\n                     \n\nreprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2515, 2537 (explaining that \"where\n            \n\nthe  precise amount owed  is difficult  to determine,  [the VWPA]\n\nauthorizes  the  court   to  reach  an   expeditious,  reasonable\n\ndetermination   of   appropriate    restitution   by    resolving\n\nuncertainties  with  a  view  toward achieving  fairness  to  the\n\nvictim\").\n\n          In this case,  appellant contends that the  restitution\n\norder is invalid because the  court's recapitulation of losses to\n\nvictims lacks  an adequate evidentiary foundation.   We disagree.\n\nThe  racketeering  count   to  which  appellant   pleaded  guilty\n\nenumerated  twenty-four racketeering  acts.   The  computation of\n\nvictim  loss   followed  this   roadmap.    The   district  court\n\nscrutinized  transcripts  of  grand jury  testimony  designed  to\n\ndocument  the aggregate amount of money involved in each episode.\n\nThe  court then attempted to  ascertain how much  of the extorted\n\nmoney appellant pocketed.5\n\n          To be sure,  reconstructing the tally was  not a black-\n\nand-white proposition.  There were points at which the guideposts\n\nbecame blurred and shadings  of gray emerged   but on  the whole,\n\nthe  available  evidence  was adequate  to  the  task.   In  some\n\ninstances, there were  specific percentages or amounts  described\n\n                    \n\n     5We  take  no  view  on  whether,  in  these  circumstances,\nrestitution  was necessarily  limited  to what  appellant himself\npocketed.\n\n                                8\n\nin the testimony.   In other  instances, the court's  calculation\n\nrested  on  testimony  establishing  the  coconspirators' general\n\nintent  about how  the  spoils  should  be  divided.    In  every\n\ninstance, the record  contained, at a  bare minimum, a  plausible\n\nbasis   on   which   to   predicate   reasonable   estimates   or\n\napproximations.  No more was exigible.\n\n          Given  the  district  court's   meticulous,  act-by-act\n\nreconstruction of  the amounts extorted, and  the court's founded\n\nestimates of the sums  retained by appellant, we cannot  say that\n\nthe court erred in compiling the overall loss amount.6\n\n                    \n\n     6While a complete catalog  of record support for  the victim\nloss   calculation  would   trespass   unduly  on   the  reader's\nindulgence, we sketch, by way of representative illustration, the\nevidence relating to two racketeering acts.\n\n          A.   Act No.  15.  A vendor  testified before the grand\n          A.   Act No.  15.\n                          \njury that he  paid appellant a  ten percent cash kickback  on all\nsales  his company made to  the City.   The vendor reported gross\nsales  to  the City  of $6,043.62  in  1988, $34,313.53  in 1989,\n$40,518.91 in 1990, and  $27,459.85 in 1991.  Because  he stopped\nmaking payments after Sarault  was arrested in June of  1991, the\nvendor  estimated that the  kickbacks for that  year were roughly\nequivalent  to  five percent  of  annual sales.    This evidence,\ncoupled with the eminently reasonable assumption that the amounts\nin  question  could  otherwise  have  been  subtracted  from  the\ninflated prices charged to  the City, provides sufficient support\nfor  the district  court's $9,460  victim loss calculation.   The\nrecord  also supports  a conclusion  that appellant  retained one\nhundred  percent of these kickbacks.   The vendor  stated that he\npaid  the money to Savoie, and  other testimony indicates, unlike\nin other  instances, that  neither Sarault nor  Simon received  a\ndime.\n\n          B.   Act No.  17.  Langlois  told the  grand jury  that\n          B.   Act No.  17.\n                          \nappellant asked  him to relay a  message to a  property owner who\nwanted a zoning variance.   The message, in  brief, was that  the\nowner's \"problem\"  could be  solved if  the wheels  of government\nwere  lubricated to the  tune of $5,000.   The owner accepted the\noffer, received  the variance, and  paid the  bribe to  Langlois.\nLanglois then brought the money to appellant.  Because one of the\nringleaders told the grand jury that \"Paul [Savoie] normally took\n\n                                9\n\n          2.  Ability to Pay.  In fashioning a restitution order,\n          2.  Ability to Pay.\n                            \n\na sentencing court does not function merely as a type of judicial\n\nabacus,  toting  up  the amount  of  loss  and  writing down  the\n\nappropriate  figure.   The court  must also \"consider  . .  . the\n\nfinancial  resources of  the defendant,  the financial  needs and\n\nearning ability of the  defendant and the defendant's dependents,\n\nand  such  other factors  as the  court  deems appropriate.\"   18\n\nU.S.C.   3664(a).   Noting that the court below  made no specific\n\nfindings with  regard to these considerations,  appellant asserts\n\nthat the restitution  order must fall.   We review this  claim of\n\nlegal error de novo.  See St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 701.\n                                 \n\n          There has been considerable  debate over when, if ever,\n\nthe  VWPA  may  require  a  restitution-ordering  court  to  make\n\nexplicit  findings concerning a  defendant's financial condition.\n\nAt least four circuits  have held that specific findings  are not\n\nrequired  in  this  general  context.     See  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCannizzaro,  871 F.2d 809,  810-12 (9th Cir.),  cert. denied, 493\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 895 (1989);  United States  v.

We rule that a district judge need not make\n\nopen-court  findings  on the  statutory  factors  when issuing  a\n\nrestitution  order so long as  the record on  appeal reveals that\n\nthe judge made implicit  findings or otherwise adequately evinced\n\nhis consideration of those  factors.  After all, the  VWPA itself\n\ndemands  no more  than  that the  district  court \"consider\"  the\n\nfactors  enumerated therein.  18  U.S.C.   3664(a).   The statute\n\nmakes no mention of  mandatory findings   a circumstance  that we\n\nbelieve is consistent with Congress's stated desire not unduly to\n\ncomplicate or  prolong the sentencing process  through the VWPA's\n\nrestitutionary  provisions.  See  18 U.S.C.    3663(d).  Whatever\n                                \n\nmay be the rule in a more extreme case   a matter on which  we do\n\nnot opine    we believe that  the absence of express  findings is\n\nnot fatal in cases in which the record clearly indicates that the\n\n                    \n\n     7The Tenth  Circuit has  sent mixed  signals on this  issue.\nAfter initially  favoring explicit findings, the  court has since\nrepudiated  the need for such findings and stated that a district\njudge only  need consider  the  defendant's financial  condition.\nCompare  United States v. Hill,  798 F.2d 402,  406-07 (10th Cir.\n                              \n1986)  (requiring   specific  findings)  with  United  States  v.\n                                                             \nMorrison, 938 F.2d  168, 171-72 (10th  Cir. 1991) (not  requiring\n        \nspecific  findings) and United States v. Rogat, 924 F.2d 983 F.2d\n                                              \n983,  986 (10th  Cir.)  (same), cert.  denied,  111 S.  Ct.  1637\n                                             \n(1991).\n\n                                11\n\ncourt gave thought to the requisite factors.\n\n          Here,  we  are  satisfied  that the  court  below  duly\n\nconsidered the  statutory factors.   The PSI  Report contained  a\n\nlengthy  discussion  of  them.   The  district  court  explicitly\n\nadopted  the PSI  Report's  findings and,  despite the  statutory\n\nburden  placed upon him, see 18 U.S.C.   3664(d), appellant never\n                            \n\noffered   evidence  suggesting   that  his   financial  condition\n\nconstituted a  barrier to  effecting full restitution.   Finally,\n\nthe  information  in  the  record   does  not  suggest  that  the\n\nrestitution order, payable in installments, is beyond appellant's\n\nreach, given his accessible assets and earning capacity.  In such\n\ncircumstances,  there is no basis for  assuming that the district\n\ncourt  ignored   the  statutory   mandate  by  failing   to  mull\n\nappellant's financial situation.\n\n          3.   The  Civil  Settlement.   The  VWPA provides  that\n          3.   The  Civil  Settlement.\n                                     \n\ncourts \"shall not impose  restitution with respect to a  loss for\n\nwhich the victim has received or is to receive compensation.\"  18\n\nU.S.C.   3663(e)(1).  On July  24, 1992, three days before he was\n\nsentenced,  appellant  signed  an  agreement  with  the  City  of\n\nPawtucket, settling Pawtucket's  claims against him  for $52,000,\n\npayable over  time.  Appellant  asserts that by  negotiating this\n\nsettlement he effectively  fulfilled (or, at least, set a ceiling\n\non) his restitutionary obligations vis-a-vis  Pawtucket's losses.\n\nWe  afford  plenary  review  to  the  web  of  essentially  legal\n\nquestions surrounding the settlement agreement's effect.  See St.\n                                                                 \n\nCyr, 977 F.2d at 701.\n   \n\n                                12\n\n          At the outset, we  remark that the settlement agreement\n\nupon which  appellant relies is  a particularly poor  vehicle for\n\nconferring special treatment:  its scope is limited; its language\n\nskirts  any  admission of  responsibility;8  and  the promise  it\n\nmemorializes is, at  present, no  more than that    an  executory\n\npromise to pay.   No money has yet changed  hands and the planned\n\nfuture payments extend over a protracted period.\n\n          Beyond these  infirmities, the sockdolager is  that the\n\nsettlement between  Savoie and the City  concerns potential civil\n\nliability.  But, the sort of  restitution imposed below is not  a\n\ncivil  affair; it is a  criminal penalty meant  to have deterrent\n\nand  rehabilitative effects.  See Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36,\n                                                   \n\n49  &amp; n.10 (1986).  Private parties  cannot simply agree to waive\n\nthe  application of a criminal statute.  See, e.g., Hairston, 888\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1153  (holding that a  civil settlement did  not necessarily\n\npreclude a restitution  order under  the VWPA  because the  penal\n\npurpose of that act was not a litigated issue in the civil case);\n\nUnited States v. Rico Indus.,  Inc., 854 F.2d 710, 715  (5th Cir.\n                                   \n\n1988) (similar), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1078 (1989).  Because the\n                             \n\nlaw will  not tolerate privately  negotiated end runs  around the\n\ncriminal  justice system,  we reject  appellant's claim  that the\n\ndistrict court could no longer order him to make restitution.  At\n\n                    \n\n     8By its terms, the settlement is restricted to claims by the\nCity  arising out  of  \"extortion by  Louis  Simon and  Brian  J.\nSarault.\"  The  agreement recites  that appellant \"denies  . .  .\nliability and disputes the  legal effect of the  alleged events.\"\nIn  turn,  the City  agrees  that the  settlement  \"is not  to be\nconstrued as an admission  of responsibility on the part  of Paul\nSavoie.\"\n\n                                13\n\nthe  same time  and for  the same  reason, we  reject appellant's\n\nrelated claim  that the  settlement figure  capped the  amount of\n\nrestitution that could be ordered.\n\n          Appellant  also contends  that  the  settlement  amount\n\nshould  at least have been  set off against  the district court's\n\nrestitution   figure.     The  statute  itself   dispatches  this\n\ncontention.   The VWPA  contemplates setting off  amounts already\n\npaid under a restitution order against amounts later recovered in\n\ncivil  proceedings.   See 18 U.S.C.    3663(e)(2).   There  is no\n                         \n\nmention  of setoffs operating in the opposite direction.  What is\n\nmore, the setoff  provision is based upon  actual payments rather\n\nthan promises to pay at some future date(s).\n\n          We  have said  enough.   In the  circumstances  of this\n\ncase, appellant has failed to prove that the restitution order is\n\n\"with respect to  a loss for which the victim  has received or is\n\nto receive compensation.\"  18 U.S.C.   3663(e)(1).  The order may\n\nstand.9\n\n                          C.  The Fine.\n                                      \n\n          Appellant's  next  foray  implicates  the  fine  levied\n\nagainst  him.   He asseverates  that, in  imposing the  fine, the\n\ndistrict  court shirked  its  statutory duty.   Appellate  courts\n\nreview the imposition of fines under the sentencing guidelines by\n\nresort  to an abuse-of-discretion  rubric.  See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     9This  is not to say,  however, that appellant  must pay the\npiper twice.  We see no reason why, in the  circumstances of this\ncase, any payments made  under the restitution order, so  long as\ndestined for the City  of Pawtucket, should not also  be credited\nagainst appellant's liability under the settlement agreement.\n\n                                14\n\nRivera,  971 F.2d  876,  895 (2d  Cir.  1992); United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nWashington-Williams,  945 F.2d  325, 326  (10th Cir.  1991).   We\n                   \n\ndiscern no abuse here.10  \n\n          Following Congress's  lead,  see 18  U.S.C.     3553(b)\n                                          \n\n(1988), the sentencing guidelines provide that the district court\n\n\"shall impose a  fine in  all cases, except  where the  defendant\n\nestablishes that  he is unable to  pay and is  unlikely to become\n\nable  to  pay any  fine.\"   U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(a).   We  take this\n\nlanguage to  mean exactly what it says:   under the guidelines, a\n\nfine  is  the  rule     and  it  is  the  defendant's  burden  to\n\ndemonstrate that his case is an exception.   See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nHickey,  917  F.2d 901,  907 (6th  Cir.  1990); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nPerez, 871 F.2d  45, 48  (6th Cir.), cert.  denied, 492 U.S.  910\n                                                  \n\n(1989).  Since appellant offered  no significant evidence on  the\n\n\"inability to pay\" issue, there is no basis for setting aside the\n\n$7,500  fine    a  fine pegged  at the  nadir  of the  applicable\n\nguideline range for the offense of conviction.\n\n          Appellant's   two   related  arguments   are  similarly\n\nunavailing.  First, the district court's failure to make  express\n\nfindings in open court concerning appellant's financial condition\n\nand  prospects does not necessitate reversal.   See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Wilfred American Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d 717, 719-20 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1992) (interpreting similar  language in predecessor statute\n\nas neither requiring findings  nor allowing an appellate tribunal\n\n                    \n\n     10Because the claim is meritless, we need not decide whether\nappellant  waived  this issue  by failing  to  raise it  below in\nsufficient detail.\n\n                                15\n\nto presume that a district court ignored relevant evidence in the\n\nrecord);  United States v.

Second, appellant's assault on the\n\nviability of U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(i) (a guideline dealing with fines\n\nimposed to cover the cost of imprisonment) is a red herring.  The\n\nrecord contains no indication that the district court imposed the\n\n$7,500 fine pursuant to that provision.\n\n        D.  Compliance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(D).\n                                                        \n\n          When a defendant alleges that  a PSI Report contains an\n\nidentified  inaccuracy, the  district  court must  either make  a\n\nfinding concerning the allegation or make a determination that no\n\nfinding  is necessary because the  matter will not  be taken into\n\naccount at sentencing.   See Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D).   The\n                            \n\ncourt must also append a  written record of any such findings  or\n\ndeterminations  to the PSI Report.  Id.  This protocol serves the\n                                       \n\ndual purpose of protecting the defendant's due process rights and\n\nsupplying a  clear record for future  proceedings (say, appellate\n\nreview or consideration for parole).  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nLevy,  897  F.2d  596, 599  (1st  Cir.  1990);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nGerante,  891 F.2d  364, 367  (1st Cir.  1989); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nBruckman,  874 F.2d 57, 63-64  (1st Cir. 1989).

Serino, 835  F.2d  924, 932  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1987).   Thus, the record in a given case may show that the court\n\nhas \"ma[d]e 'implicit' findings  on disputed factual questions by\n\naccepting  the  government's  recommendations  at  the sentencing\n\nhearing.\"  United States v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc., 922 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n54, 58 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The  circumstances here  are  analogous to  those  that\n\nconfronted  the  Wells court.    The  judge  presented  both  the\n                      \n\nprosecutor and defense counsel with an opportunity to voice their\n\nconcerns  anent the  contents  of  the  PSI  Report.    He  heard\n\narguments  from  both  sides   about  disputed  matters.    After\n\nargument,   the  judge   accepted  the   government's  sentencing\n\nrecommendations and  then indicated  in writing,  as part  of the\n\njudgment, that  he had \"adopt[ed] the  factual findings . .  . in\n\nthe  presentence  report.\"    We   think  that  this  writing  is\n\ntantamount to  the slightly more  elaborate notation made  by the\n\njudge in Wells, 922 F.2d at 58,  and that the purposes of Rule 32\n              \n\nwere equally served.  The only logically  inferable conclusion is\n\nthat the  court rejected each  and all of  appellant's fact-based\n\nchallenges to the PSI Report.  See id.; see also United States v.\n                                                              \n\nCruz,     F.2d    ,     (1st Cir. 1992) [No. 91-1047, slip op. at\n    \n\n                                17\n\n12-15];  Gerante, 891 F.2d at 367; Bruckman,  874 F.2d at 64.  In\n                                           \n\nshort,   the  district   court  made   adequately  particularized\n\nfindings,   and   created    a   minimally   sufficient   written\n\nmemorialization of those findings,  when it expressly adopted the\n\nfacts  as limned in  the PSI Report,  thereby necessarily finding\n\nagainst appellant on all disputed matters of fact.  Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(c)(3)(D) was not violated.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need  go no  further.11  Although  appellant parades\n\na  battery  of  challenges before  us,  none  pass  muster.   The\n\njudgment below must, therefore, be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     11Appellant further  hints,  without providing  any  detail,\nthat the sentencing court may have failed to \"state in open court\nthe reasons  for its  imposition of  the particular  sentence\" as\nrequired by 18 U.S.C.   3553(c) (1988).  Read in conjunction with\nthe  pointed   comments  delivered  by  the   district  court  at\nsentencing,  this suggestion  borders on  the frivolous.   At any\nrate, we  will not attempt to  fathom what appellant may  have in\nmind, for it is our established rule that  \"issues adverted to in\na perfunctory  manner, unaccompanied by some  effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"  United States v.

Savoie in  a\n\nrelentless  effort  to  ameliorate  a  sentence  imposed  in  the\n\ndistrict  court.  Concluding, as we do, that appellant is digging\n\nin barren soil, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          For several years, appellant led a  double life.  While\n\nserving  as a  policy adviser  to the  mayor of  Pawtucket, Rhode\n\nIsland, he was also part of a trio of high-ranking city officials\n\nwho  systematically  exploited  the  public  trust  for  personal\n\nprofit.  The other  two members of the tarnished troika  were the\n\nmayor, Brian Sarault, see  United States v. Sarault, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590894\"><a href=\"/opinion/590894/united-states-v-brian-j-sarault/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                                   \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992),  and the  acting public  works  director, Louis\n\nSimon.    Because  of  the  extensive  range  and  reach  of  the\n\ntriumvirate's  illegal  activities,  we  abjure  any  attempt  to\n\ndescribe the plot  at this juncture.  We will,  however, refer to\n\ncertain  relevant  outrages in  connection  with  our canvass  of\n\nappellant's arguments on appeal.\n\n          Savoie  eventually  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of\n\nracketeering, see 18 U.S.C.    1962(c) (1988), and two  counts of\n                 \n\nextortion,  see 18  U.S.C.    1951 (1988).1   At  sentencing, the\n               \n\ndistrict court reviewed the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport), appellant's objections thereto, and transcripts of grand\n\n                    \n\n     1The other twenty-seven counts in the  indictment, including\nnumerous  charges of  attempted extortion,  conspiracy to  commit\nextortion, and  receiving bribes, were dismissed  by agreement at\nthe time of sentencing.\n\n                                2\n\njury testimony  furnished by the government.   Appellant chose to\n\npresent  no independent  evidence (although  he did  rely on  his\n\ndescription of  the offense as  related to the  probation officer\n\nand incorporated in the PSI Report).\n\n          For the most part, the  district court adopted the  PSI\n\nReport's suggested findings.   The court calculated the guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR) at 41-51 months (offense level 22/criminal\n\nhistory  category I) and imposed an incarcerative sentence at the\n\ntop of  the range.  The  court also imposed a  three-year term of\n\nsupervised  release,  a  $7,500   fine,  a  $150  special  felony\n\nassessment, and  150 hours  of community  service.   Finally, the\n\ncourt   ordered  Savoie  to  make  restitution   in  the  sum  of\n\n$93,476.67.  This appeal followed.\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          We  have grouped  appellant's  myriad complaints  under\n\nfour headings.  We discuss them sequentially.\n\n             A.  The Role-in-the-Offense Adjustment.\n                                                   \n\n          The sentencing guidelines  mandate a three-level upward\n\nadjustment if  \"the defendant was a  manager or supervisor .  . .\n\nand the criminal  activity involved five or  more participants or\n\nwas  otherwise  extensive.\"   U.S.S.G.     3B1.1(b) (Nov.  1991).\n\nAppellant claims that the district court erred in relying on this\n\nproviso.   In  this case,  the  criminal activity  was  extensive\n\nenough to satisfy the  guideline.  The only cognizable  question,\n\nthen, is whether the  sentencing court erred in  determining that\n\nappellant was  a manager or  supervisor of the  ring.  Where,  as\n\n                                3\n\nhere,  the sentencing  court's decision  to apply  a role-in-the-\n\noffense adjustment is factbound, we review the determination only\n\nfor clear  error.

Where  numerous   participants  are\n\ninvolved, or  the criminal  activity is otherwise  extensive, the\n\ncourt must often make  hierarchical distinctions between those at\n\nthe  very  top  of the  criminal  enterprise  (the  organizers or\n\nleaders)  and   those  who,  while  in   positions  of  executive\n\nauthority,   are  lower  on  the  totem  pole  (the  managers  or\n\n                                4\n\nsupervisors).   In making such fine distinctions,  the indicia of\n\nexecutive status include  such things as the  defendant's role in\n\nrecruiting accomplices, the degree  and nature of the defendant's\n\nparticipation  in  planning  and  implementing  the offense,  the\n\ndefendant's   exercise  of  decisionmaking   authority,  and  the\n\ndefendant's  level of remuneration relative to other participants\n\n(including the  presence or absence of a claimed right to a share\n\nof  the crime's fruits).

In\n\naddition to  extorting funds himself, appellant used internuncios\n\n(e.g., Joseph Stifano, Robert Langlois) as conduits for obtaining\n     \n\nbribes;2 manipulated Pawtucket's highway  director (Ron Lieto) in\n\norder  to extract  free services  for  himself from  a contractor\n\ndoing business with  the City; gave occasional  directions to his\n\nfellow triumvir, Louis  Simon; and, in  general, as the  district\n\njudge  aptly put  it,  \"made some  rather significant  decisions,\n\nincluding the decision of  how much [would be demanded]  and from\n\nwhom [it would be extorted].\"\n\n          We are  completely unmoved by appellant's  plea that he\n\n                    \n\n     2The RICO count to which appellant pleaded described twenty-\nfour separate  racketeering acts.   Act No.  17, described  infra\n                                                                 \nnote  6,  is  an excellent  example  of  how  appellant used  go-\nbetweens.\n\n                                5\n\nwas merely a footsoldier  in Mayor Sarault's iniquitous army.   A\n\ndefendant  need not be the  highest ranking member  of a criminal\n\ntroupe in  order  to be  a manager  or supervisor.   Indeed,  the\n\napplicable  guideline provision  stresses  that  managerial  role\n\nadjustments,  as  opposed  to  other  upward  role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustments,   apply   to  defendants   who   were  managers   or\n\nsupervisors,  but  not organizers  or  leaders.   See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n\n3B1.1(b).  In  other words, Sarault's acknowledged status  as the\n\ncommander-in-chief  is not  in  any sense  inconsistent with  the\n\ncourt's finding that  appellant was his  lieutenant.  See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

Appellant was  a prime\n\nmover in a pervasive pattern of municipal  corruption lasting for\n\nseveral years.

In this  instance the\n                     \n\ndistrict  court  ordered  restitution,  directing  that appellant\n\nrepay,  in  installments,  a  total of  $93,476.67.4    Appellant\n\nattacks the order on three grounds.

We disagree.\n\nThe  racketeering  count   to  which  appellant   pleaded  guilty\n\nenumerated  twenty-four racketeering  acts.   The  computation of\n\nvictim  loss   followed  this   roadmap.    The   district  court\n\nscrutinized  transcripts  of  grand jury  testimony  designed  to\n\ndocument  the aggregate amount of money involved in each episode.\n\nThe  court then attempted to  ascertain how much  of the extorted\n\nmoney appellant pocketed.5\n\n          To be sure,  reconstructing the tally was  not a black-\n\nand-white proposition.  There were points at which the guideposts\n\nbecame blurred and shadings  of gray emerged   but on  the whole,\n\nthe  available  evidence  was adequate  to  the  task.   In  some\n\ninstances, there were  specific percentages or amounts  described\n\n                    \n\n     5We  take  no  view  on  whether,  in  these  circumstances,\nrestitution  was necessarily  limited  to what  appellant himself\npocketed.\n\n                                8\n\nin the testimony.   In other  instances, the court's  calculation\n\nrested  on  testimony  establishing  the  coconspirators' general\n\nintent  about how  the  spoils  should  be  divided.    In  every\n\ninstance, the record  contained, at a  bare minimum, a  plausible\n\nbasis   on   which   to   predicate   reasonable   estimates   or\n\napproximations.  No more was exigible.\n\n          Given  the  district  court's   meticulous,  act-by-act\n\nreconstruction of  the amounts extorted, and  the court's founded\n\nestimates of the sums  retained by appellant, we cannot  say that\n\nthe court erred in compiling the overall loss amount.6\n\n                    \n\n     6While a complete catalog  of record support for  the victim\nloss   calculation  would   trespass   unduly  on   the  reader's\nindulgence, we sketch, by way of representative illustration, the\nevidence relating to two racketeering acts.\n\n          A.   Act No.  15.  A vendor  testified before the grand\n          A.   Act No.  15.\n                          \njury that he  paid appellant a  ten percent cash kickback  on all\nsales  his company made to  the City.   The vendor reported gross\nsales  to  the City  of $6,043.62  in  1988, $34,313.53  in 1989,\n$40,518.91 in 1990, and  $27,459.85 in 1991.  Because  he stopped\nmaking payments after Sarault  was arrested in June of  1991, the\nvendor  estimated that the  kickbacks for that  year were roughly\nequivalent  to  five percent  of  annual sales.    This evidence,\ncoupled with the eminently reasonable assumption that the amounts\nin  question  could  otherwise  have  been  subtracted  from  the\ninflated prices charged to  the City, provides sufficient support\nfor  the district  court's $9,460  victim loss calculation.   The\nrecord  also supports  a conclusion  that appellant  retained one\nhundred  percent of these kickbacks.   The vendor  stated that he\npaid  the money to Savoie, and  other testimony indicates, unlike\nin other  instances, that  neither Sarault nor  Simon received  a\ndime.\n\n          B.   Act No.  17.  Langlois  told the  grand jury  that\n          B.   Act No.  17.\n                          \nappellant asked  him to relay a  message to a  property owner who\nwanted a zoning variance.   The message, in  brief, was that  the\nowner's \"problem\"  could be  solved if  the wheels  of government\nwere  lubricated to the  tune of $5,000.   The owner accepted the\noffer, received  the variance, and  paid the  bribe to  Langlois.\nLanglois then brought the money to appellant.

The court  must also \"consider  . .  . the\n\nfinancial  resources of  the defendant,  the financial  needs and\n\nearning ability of the  defendant and the defendant's dependents,\n\nand  such  other factors  as the  court  deems appropriate.\"   18\n\nU.S.C.   3664(a).   Noting that the court below  made no specific\n\nfindings with  regard to these considerations,  appellant asserts\n\nthat the restitution  order must fall.   We review this  claim of\n\nlegal error de novo.

We rule that a district judge need not make\n\nopen-court  findings  on the  statutory  factors  when issuing  a\n\nrestitution  order so long as  the record on  appeal reveals that\n\nthe judge made implicit  findings or otherwise adequately evinced\n\nhis consideration of those  factors.

The statute\n\nmakes no mention of  mandatory findings   a circumstance  that we\n\nbelieve is consistent with Congress's stated desire not unduly to\n\ncomplicate or  prolong the sentencing process  through the VWPA's\n\nrestitutionary  provisions.

The PSI  Report contained  a\n\nlengthy  discussion  of  them.   The  district  court  explicitly\n\nadopted  the PSI  Report's  findings and,  despite the  statutory\n\nburden  placed upon him, see 18 U.S.C.   3664(d), appellant never\n                            \n\noffered   evidence  suggesting   that  his   financial  condition\n\nconstituted a  barrier to  effecting full restitution.   Finally,\n\nthe  information  in  the  record   does  not  suggest  that  the\n\nrestitution order, payable in installments, is beyond appellant's\n\nreach, given his accessible assets and earning capacity.  In such\n\ncircumstances,  there is no basis for  assuming that the district\n\ncourt  ignored   the  statutory   mandate  by  failing   to  mull\n\nappellant's financial situation.\n\n          3.

Appellant  asserts that by  negotiating this\n\nsettlement he effectively  fulfilled (or, at least, set a ceiling\n\non) his restitutionary obligations vis-a-vis  Pawtucket's losses.\n\nWe  afford  plenary  review  to  the  web  of  essentially  legal\n\nquestions surrounding the settlement agreement's effect.  See St.\n                                                                 \n\nCyr, 977 F.2d at 701.\n   \n\n                                12\n\n          At the outset, we  remark that the settlement agreement\n\nupon which  appellant relies is  a particularly poor  vehicle for\n\nconferring special treatment:  its scope is limited; its language\n\nskirts  any  admission of  responsibility;8  and  the promise  it\n\nmemorializes is, at  present, no  more than that    an  executory\n\npromise to pay.   No money has yet changed  hands and the planned\n\nfuture payments extend over a protracted period.\n\n          Beyond these  infirmities, the sockdolager is  that the\n\nsettlement between  Savoie and the City  concerns potential civil\n\nliability.  But, the sort of  restitution imposed below is not  a\n\ncivil  affair; it is a  criminal penalty meant  to have deterrent\n\nand  rehabilitative effects.  See Kelly v.

Because the\n                             \n\nlaw will  not tolerate privately  negotiated end runs  around the\n\ncriminal  justice system,  we reject  appellant's claim  that the\n\ndistrict court could no longer order him to make restitution.  At\n\n                    \n\n     8By its terms, the settlement is restricted to claims by the\nCity  arising out  of  \"extortion by  Louis  Simon and  Brian  J.\nSarault.\"  The  agreement recites  that appellant \"denies  . .  .\nliability and disputes the  legal effect of the  alleged events.\"\nIn  turn,  the City  agrees  that the  settlement  \"is not  to be\nconstrued as an admission  of responsibility on the part  of Paul\nSavoie.\"\n\n                                13\n\nthe  same time  and for  the same  reason, we  reject appellant's\n\nrelated claim  that the  settlement figure  capped the  amount of\n\nrestitution that could be ordered.\n\n          Appellant  also contends  that  the  settlement  amount\n\nshould  at least have been  set off against  the district court's\n\nrestitution   figure.     The  statute  itself   dispatches  this\n\ncontention.   The VWPA  contemplates setting off  amounts already\n\npaid under a restitution order against amounts later recovered in\n\ncivil  proceedings.   See 18 U.S.C.    3663(e)(2).   There  is no\n                         \n\nmention  of setoffs operating in the opposite direction.  What is\n\nmore, the setoff  provision is based upon  actual payments rather\n\nthan promises to pay at some future date(s).\n\n          We  have said  enough.   In the  circumstances  of this\n\ncase, appellant has failed to prove that the restitution order is\n\n\"with respect to  a loss for which the victim  has received or is\n\nto receive compensation.\"  18 U.S.C.   3663(e)(1).  The order may\n\nstand.9\n\n                          C.  The Fine.\n                                      \n\n          Appellant's  next  foray  implicates  the  fine  levied\n\nagainst  him.   He asseverates  that, in  imposing the  fine, the\n\ndistrict  court shirked  its  statutory duty.   Appellate  courts\n\nreview the imposition of fines under the sentencing guidelines by\n\nresort  to an abuse-of-discretion  rubric.  See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     9This  is not to say,  however, that appellant  must pay the\npiper twice.  We see no reason why, in the  circumstances of this\ncase, any payments made  under the restitution order, so  long as\ndestined for the City  of Pawtucket, should not also  be credited\nagainst appellant's liability under the settlement agreement.\n\n                                14\n\nRivera,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588113\"><a href=\"/opinion/588113/united-states-v-george-rivera-ward-johnson-walter-david-cook-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  895 (2d  Cir.  1992); United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nWashington-Williams,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568608\"><a href=\"/opinion/568608/united-states-v-glenda-r-washington-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326  (10th Cir.  1991).

First, the district court's failure to make  express\n\nfindings in open court concerning appellant's financial condition\n\nand  prospects does not necessitate reversal.   See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Wilfred American Educ.

Second, appellant's assault on the\n\nviability of U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(i) (a guideline dealing with fines\n\nimposed to cover the cost of imprisonment) is a red herring.  The\n\nrecord contains no indication that the district court imposed the\n\n$7,500 fine pursuant to that provision.\n\n        D.  Compliance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(D).\n                                                        \n\n          When a defendant alleges that  a PSI Report contains an\n\nidentified  inaccuracy, the  district  court must  either make  a\n\nfinding concerning the allegation or make a determination that no\n\nfinding  is necessary because the  matter will not  be taken into\n\naccount at sentencing.   See Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D).   The\n                            \n\ncourt must also append a  written record of any such findings  or\n\ndeterminations  to the PSI Report.  Id.  This protocol serves the\n                                       \n\ndual purpose of protecting the defendant's due process rights and\n\nsupplying a  clear record for future  proceedings (say, appellate\n\nreview or consideration for parole).

The  judge  presented  both  the\n                      \n\nprosecutor and defense counsel with an opportunity to voice their\n\nconcerns  anent the  contents  of  the  PSI  Report.    He  heard\n\narguments  from  both  sides   about  disputed  matters.    After\n\nargument,   the  judge   accepted  the   government's  sentencing\n\nrecommendations and  then indicated  in writing,  as part  of the\n\njudgment, that  he had \"adopt[ed] the  factual findings . .  . in\n\nthe  presentence  report.\"    We   think  that  this  writing  is\n\ntantamount to  the slightly more  elaborate notation made  by the\n\njudge in Wells, 922 F.2d at 58,  and that the purposes of Rule 32\n              \n\nwere equally served.

Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(c)(3)(D) was not violated.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need  go no  further.11  Although  appellant parades\n\na  battery  of  challenges before  us,  none  pass  muster.

Read in conjunction with\nthe  pointed   comments  delivered  by  the   district  court  at\nsentencing,  this suggestion  borders on  the frivolous.
