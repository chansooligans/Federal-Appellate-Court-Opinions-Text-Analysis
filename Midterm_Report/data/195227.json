We affirm.\n\n                      I.  Factual Background\n                                            \n\n      In August  1992, Robert George  Forbes, a  Jamaican citizen,\n\nwas  deported from  New York  to Jamaica.   The  following month,\n\nForbes  attempted  to reenter  the  United  States  with a  false\n\npassport that had been altered to include his picture.  A federal\n\ngrand jury in the District of Puerto Rico subsequently returned a\n\ntwo count indictment against Forbes, charging him with unlawfully\n\nusing an altered passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    1543, and\n\nwith unlawfully  attempting to  reenter the  United States  after\n\nhaving previously been arrested and  deported, in violation of  8\n\nU.S.C.   1326.1  \n\n                    \n\n     1The indictment reads as follows:\n                            Count One\n           On  or about  September 20,  1992, in  the District  of\n      Puerto Rico, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, \n                       Robert George Forbes\n                          also known as\n                      Julian David Brynteson\n      the defendant herein, while applying  for admission into the\n      United   States  of   America,  willfully,   knowingly,  and\n      unlawfully, did  use an  altered  passport,  to wit:  United\n      Kingdom passport  number 003856139  in  the  name of  JULIAN\n      DAVID BRYNTESON which passport had  been altered by removing\n      the photograph  of the owner  and replacing it  with one  of\n      the defendant.  All in violation of Title 18, United  States\n      Code, Section 1543.\n\n                            COUNT TWO\n                                     \n           On  or about  September  20, 1992,  in the  district of\n      Puerto Rico and within the jurisdiction of this Court, \n                       Robert George Forbes\n                          also known as\n                      Julian David Brynteson\n\n                               -2-\n\n      On December 16, 1992, Forbes entered into a plea  agreement,\n\nin which he pled guilty only to the charge of unlawfully entering\n\nthe  United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C.    1326.  As part of\n\nhis plea, Forbes  waived his right to appeal  \"any legal sentence\n\nimposed by the Court under  the Sentencing Guidelines as a result\n\nof this Plea Agreement.\"  \n\n      Forbes' presentence report (PSR)  computed his total offense\n\nlevel at 21: 8 points were assigned as the base offense level for\n\nconvictions under 8 U.S.C.    1326, 16 points were  added for his\n\nprevious deportation after a conviction for an aggravated felony,\n\nand 3 points were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility and\n\ntimely  notifying authorities of  his intention to  plead guilty.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.      2L1.2(a), (b)(2);  3E1.1(b)(2).   The PSR  also\n   \n\nrecommended  a  criminal  history category  of  III,  based  on 4\n\ncriminal history points.  See U.S.S.G.   5, Part A.\n                             \n\n      At  a  sentencing  hearing  held  on  March  12,  1993,  the\n\ndistrict  court adopted  the  recommendations  of  the  PSR,  and\n\ndetermined the corresponding  sentencing guidelines  range to  be\n\n46-57 months.  Based on  evidence of Forbes' cooperation with the\n\ngovernment  in  other  cases, and  his  continued  willingness to\n\n                    \n\n      the  defendant herein,  being an  alien  previously arrested\n      and deported  from the United States,  that is, on or  about\n      August  18,  1992, to  Jamaica,  willfully,  knowingly,  and\n      unlawfully did attempt  to reenter the United States from  a\n      place outside of the United  States without having obtained,\n      prior  to  his  reembarkation,   the  express  consent   and\n      permission   from  the   Attorney  General  of   the  United\n      Stat[e]s.  All in violation of Title 8, United States  Code,\n      Section 1326.\n\n                               -3-\n\ncooperate in the  future, the sentencing judge  departed downward\n\nfrom the applicable guideline range, and imposed a sentence of 36\n\nmonths  plus  three years  of  supervised release.    This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n      Forbes argues  that the  waiver of  his right  to appeal  is\n\nineffective, because it  was not knowingly and  voluntarily made;\n\nand that, even were the waiver effective, he still has a right to\n\nappeal  his sentence,  because the  court erred  in applying  the\n\nSentencing Guidelines to  compute his sentence.   He also  claims\n\nthat the  government's failure  to allege  in his  indictment the\n\naggravated felony used  to enhance his sentence under  8 U.S.C.  \n\n1326(b)(2) renders the  indictment sufficient only to  charge him\n\nwith a  violation of 8 U.S.C.   1326(a).   Forbes' final claim is\n\nthat the use of a prior felony conviction to enhance his sentence\n\nunder     1326   violates  the  ex  post  facto   clause  of  the\n                                               \n\nConstitution.\n\n                    II.  The Waiver Provision\n                                             \n\n      By  its  terms,  the  waiver   provision  in  Forbes'   plea\n\nagreement is narrow, covering only  the right to appeal any legal\n                                                                 \n\nsentence imposed  under the Sentencing  Guidelines.  We  need not\n\nreach  the  question  of  whether  his  waiver  was  knowing  and\n\nvoluntary,  nor whether Forbes'  claims lie  beyond the  scope of\n\nthis waiver, because his  appeal suffers from a more  fundamental\n\ndefect.  Because  he failed to raise any of  these claimed errors\n\nbefore the district court, with the exception of his challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of  the indictment, see infra at  5-14, we cannot\n                                             \n\n                               -4-\n\ncorrect them  absent a showing  of plain error, United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nCarozza, 4 F.3d  70, 86-87 (1st Cir. 1993).  As we discuss below,\n       \n\nForbes has failed to make such a showing here.  \n\n                 III.  Forbes' Section 1326 Claim\n                                                 \n\n      Forbes  pled  guilty  to  one   count  of  unlawful  reentry\n\nfollowing deportation, in violation of  8 U.S.C.   1326, the full\n\ntext  of which is  set forth in  the margin.2   Subsection (b) of\n\nthis provision  was added  by Congress as  part of  the Anti-Drug\n\nAbuse Act of 1988, see Pub. L. 100-690, Title VII,   7345(a), 102\n                      \n\nStat. 4471  (codified as amended  at 8 U.S.C.    1326(b) (1988)).\n\nForbes'  indictment  alleged  only  unlawful  reentry   following\n\n                    \n\n     2This statute provides:\n\n      (a) Subject  to subsection  (b) of  this section,  any alien\n      who--\n           (1) has  been arrested  and  deported  or excluded  and\n      deported, and thereafter\n           (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time  found\n      in,   the  United   States,   unless   (A)   prior  to   his\n      reembarkation at a place  outside the United  States or  his\n      application   for   admission   from   foreign    contiguous\n      territory, the Attorney General  has expressly consented  to\n      such alien's reapplying for admission;  or (B) with  respect\n      to an  alien previously excluded  and deported,  unless such\n      alien shall  establish that  he was not  required to  obtain\n      such advance consent under this chapter or any prior Act,\n\n      shall be fined under  Title 18, or imprisoned not more  than\n2 years, or both.\n\n      (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of  this section, in  the\n      case of any alien described in such subsection--\n           (1) whose  deportation was subsequent  to a  conviction\n      for  commission  of  a  felony  (other  than  an  aggravated\n      felony),  such  alien  shall  be   fined  under  Title   18,\n      imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; or\n           (2)  whose deportation  was subsequent to  a conviction\n      for commission of an aggravated felony, such  alien shall be\n      fined under such  Title, imprisoned not more than 15  years,\n      or both.\n\n                               -5-\n\ndeportation,  and did  not  include any  reference  to his  prior\n\naggravated   felony  conviction.      Forbes   claims  that   the\n\ngovernment's failure to  allege the prior aggravated  felony that\n\npermitted it  to sentence him  within the limits set  forth under\n\nsubsection  (b)(2)  renders  the  indictment  sufficient only  to\n\ncharge a violation  of   1326(a), and requires  that his sentence\n\nbe contained  within  the statutory  maximum  set forth  by  that\n\nsubsection.  If, as Forbes contends, \n\n  1326(a) and   1326(b) describe separate and distinct  offenses,\n\nhis sentence  cannot stand,  because he  cannot be  sentenced and\n\nconvicted under a statutory provision under which he has not been\n\nindicted.   Hamling v.  United States, 418  U.S. 87,  117 (1974);\n                                     \n\nUnited States  v.  McDonough, 959  F.2d 1137,  1140-41 (1st  Cir.\n                            \n\n1992).          The government  replies  that  Forbes' failure  to\n\npresent this issue before the district court bars this court from\n\nconsidering  it on  appeal.    It claims,  further,  that    1326\n\ndescribes only  a single  offense, and that  subsection (b)  is a\n\nsentence  enhancement  provision,  which  permits  the  court  to\n\nincrease  the  penalties   for  a  violation  depending   on  the\n\ndefendant's criminal record.  \n\n      Forbes'  failure  to  point  out  perceived  defects  in the\n\nindictment does not  preclude our consideration of  this argument\n\non appeal.  Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2), an\n\nobjection that an indictment fails to  state an essential element\n\nof an  offense \"shall be noticed by the  court at any time during\n\nthe pendency of  the proceedings.\"  This objection  may be raised\n\n                               -6-\n\nby  a defendant  for the first  time on appeal,  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nSeuss, 474 F.2d  385, 387 n.2 (1st  Cir. 1973), or by  an appeals\n     \n\ncourt sua sponte, see United States v. Saade, 652 F.2d 1126, 1133\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1981)  (citing cases).  When such an objection is urged\n\nfor  the   first  time  on  appeal,  courts  have  required  that\n\nindictments be construed  liberally, finding an indictment  to be\n\nsufficient unless there is no reasonable construction by which it\n\ncould charge  an offense for  which the defendant  was convicted.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.  Wilson, 884 F.2d 174,  179-181 (5th\n                                    \n\nCir. 1989).   While  statutory citation,  standing alone,  cannot\n\nsubstitute  for setting  forth the  elements of  a crime,  it may\n\nreinforce other references  in the indictment so as  to render it\n\nvalid.  United States v. McLennan, 672 F.2d 239, 243-44 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1982).\n\n      Forbes'  indictment  follows  the  language  of  8  U.S.C.  \n\n1326(a).    It makes  no reference  to the  fact that  Forbes was\n\ndeported subsequent  to a  conviction for  an aggravated  felony.\n\nIf, as Forbes  maintains, an aggravated  felony conviction is  an\n\nelement of a    1326(b) offense, his  indictment is insufficient,\n\nbecause  it fails to set  out an essential  element of an offense\n\nunder that section.\n\n      Whether   1326(a) and    1326(b) describe separate  criminal\n\noffenses, with  different elements  and maximum  penalties, or  a\n\nsingle  offense,   allowing  sentence  enhancement  based   on  a\n\ndefendant's  criminal history, is an issue of first impression in\n\n                               -7-\n\nthis  court.3   The  District  Court for  the  District of  Rhode\n\nIsland, the only court within  our circuit to address this issue,\n\nrecently held that   1326(a) and   1326(b) set forth separate and\n\ndistinct offenses, with different elements and maximum penalties.\n\nUnited States v. Vieira-Candelario, 811 F. Supp. 762, 768 (D.R.I.\n                                  \n\n1993).   The Fifth  and the Ninth  Circuits, both  of which  have\n\ntackled  this issue in the past two  years, have come to opposite\n\nconclusions.  See United States  v. Campos-Martinez, 976 F.2d 589\n                                                   \n\n(9th Cir. 1992) (sections 1326(a) and (b) state separate crimes);\n\nUnited States  v. Gonzalez-Medina, 976  F.2d 570 (9th  Cir. 1992)\n                                 \n\n(same)4; United States v. Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d 943  (5th Cir.\n                                        \n\n1993) (section  1326(b)  is a  sentence enhancement  provision)5;\n\nsee also  United States v. Crawford,  815 F. Supp. 920  (E.D. Va.\n                                   \n\n1993) (same).\n\n      In determining whether a statute  is a sentence  enhancement\n\nprovision  or  a  separate  criminal  offense,  we  look  at  its\n\nlanguage,  structure, and legislative history.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3We have,  however, noted the  issue.  See United  States v.\n                                                              \nZapata, 1  F.3d 46, 50 n.5 (1st  Cir. 1993) (citing United States\n                                                                 \nv. Vieira-Candelario, 811 F. Supp. 762, 768 (D.R.I. 1993)).\n                    \n\n     4The Ninth  Circuit decisions  gave no  rationale for  their\nconclusion  that these  provisions  described separate  offenses,\nwith different elements and maximum sentences, other  than to say\nthat this statute was similar to 8 U.S.C.   1325, which counted a\nprior conviction  for illegal entry  as an element of  the felony\noffense under  that section.   See  Campos-Martinez, 976  F.2d at\n                                                   \n591-92; Gonzalez-Medina, 976 F.2d at 572-73.\n                       \n\n     5Judge  King wrote a dissenting opinion in which she adopted\nthe  Ninth Circuit's analysis in Campos-Martinez and the District\n                                                \nof Rhode  Island's analysis  in Vieira-Candelario.   999  F.2d at\n                                                 \n947-950.\n\n                               -8-\n\nStates v.

We have  noted that  particular structural  features,\n\nsuch as a  penalty that is a  multiplier of the sentence  for the\n\nunderlying  crime,  or  a   title  denoting  it  as   a  sentence\n\nenhancement provision, may indicate that a statutory provision is\n\na sentence  enhancer, but we  have not treated these  features as\n\nconclusive.   See id. at  718-19.  Our  analysis begins with  the\n                     \n\nstatute's language and structure.\n\n      In  our view,  the  language  and  structure are  unhelpful,\n\nbecause the  provisions are  subject to  two plausible  readings.\n\nThe first  was adopted by the  Fifth Circuit and used  to support\n\nits  conclusion that  subsection (b)  is  a sentence  enhancement\n\nprovision.   Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d  at 946.  That  court noted\n                           \n\nthat,  in drafting the  introductory language of  subsections (a)\n\nand   (b),  Congress   intertwined   the   two  provisions:   the\n\nintroductory  language  of  subsection  (a)  states  \"subject  to\n\nsubsection (b) of this section,\" and the introductory language of\n\nsubsection  (b)  states,  \"subject  to  subsection  (a)  of  this\n\nsection.\"   The  Fifth Circuit  found  that it  would be  \"highly\n\nunlikely that Congress would structure  the statute in such a way\n\nthat subsection (b) is  dependent on elements of subsection  (a),\n\nif  it intended  for subsection  (b)  to be  a separate  criminal\n\noffense.\"  Id.; accord Crawford, 815 F.

Vasquez-Olvera,  999 F.2d  at 948\n                                              \n\n(King, J. dissenting);  see also Vieira-Candelario, 811  F.

The\n\nfact that each subsection makes  reference to the other is simply\n\nthe  logical way  of  indicating  the  relationship  between  the\n\narguably two separate crimes.  \n\n      Nor does the title of the statute offer sufficient  guidance\n\nabout whether subsection (b) is a sentence enhancer or a separate\n\nelement  of the  crime.   Before 1988,  the statute  was entitled\n\n\"Reentry of deported alien.\"  In 1988, the statute was amended to\n\nadd  subsection (b),  and  to  change the  title  to \"Reentry  of\n\ndeported  alien;   criminal  penalties  for  reentry  of  certain\n\ndeported aliens.\"  One  court has argued that this change  in the\n\ntitle indicates  that in  amending    1326, Congress  intended to\n\ncreate  enhanced penalties for  certain aliens who  committed the\n                                       \n\nunderlying offense  of  unlawfully reentering  the United  States\n\nfollowing deportation.

While this\n                                \n\nargument has some force, we think that a competing interpretation\n\nis equally permissible.   The bifurcated structure of    1326 and\n\nthe apparent incorporation of the elements of subsection (a) into\n\nsubsection  (b) might  also suggest  that  Congress intended  the\n\nbroad title of the offense (\"reentry of deported alien\") to apply\n\n                               -10-\n\nto both separate offenses in the different subsections.  Vasquez-\n                                                                 \n\nOlvera, 999 F.2d at 949 (King, J., dissenting).  Finally, we have\n      \n\nnot  found any  legislative  history  discussing this  particular\n\naspect of 8 U.S.C.   1326(b)(2).  Lacking   insight    from   the\n\nlanguage, structure and  legislative history we are  compelled to\n\ntake a broader look  at the factors  implicated by a decision  to\n\nclassify a provision either as  a sentence enhancer or a separate\n\ncrime.   In  so doing,  we  have  found guidance  in  a  previous\n\ndecision of  this court  addressing a similar  issue.   In United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714 (1st Cir. 1989), we were  asked to\n                \n\ndetermine  whether the  Armed  Career Criminal  Act, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n1202(a) (Supp.  1984)  (ACCA)6,  was a  sentence  enhancer  or  a\n\nseparate substantive  crime.  Section  1202(a) penalized receipt,\n\npossession, or  transportation of  firearms by  those with  prior\n\nfelony convictions.   The ACCA amended  this statute to  increase\n\nthe minimum  penalty for  a person who  \"receives, possesses,  or\n\ntransports in  commerce  . .  .  any firearm  and  who has  three\n\nprevious felony convictions.\"  18 U.S.C.   1202(a) (Supp.  1984).\n\nRumney, like  Forbes, challenged  his sentence  under the  higher\n\nmaximum,  arguing that the  government's failure to  allege three\n\nprior convictions  in  the  indictment  rendered  the  indictment\n\ninsufficient to charge a violation of the ACCA.  867 F.2d at 717.\n\n      We  resolved  the  question  in  Rumney  primarily  based on\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n     6The statute  has since  been recodified  into two  separate\nprovisions.    The  first  sentence  of  the  former     1202(a),\ndescribing  the  unlawful conduct,  now  appears at  18  U.S.C.  \n922(g), while the  ACCA provision has been  incorporated into the\nother penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C.   924(e).  \n\n                               -11-\n\nlegislative history, which demonstrated Congress' intent that the\n\nACCA  be  a  sentence  enhancer,  and  not  a separate  statutory\n\nelement.  We  also observed, however, that the  special nature of\n\nthe  disputed  prior  crimes  provision   further  supported  its\n\nclassification  as a  sentence enhancer.   Rumney, 867  F.2d 714,\n                                                 \n\n718-19; see  also United  States v. Jackson,  824 F.2d  21, 25-26\n                                           \n\n(D.C. Cir. 1987).  \n\n      We felt it  significant that if the disputed provision  were\n\ndeemed a separate  element, the government  would be required  to\n\nplace evidence of the defendant's prior felony convictions before\n\nthe jury.   The introduction  of prior crimes evidence  is highly\n\nprejudicial, and  should not  be permitted  lightly, Rumney,  867\n                                                           \n\nF.2d at  719; see  also Jackson,  824 F.2d  at 25  (noting strong\n                               \n\nCongressional policy  of avoiding  introduction of  this type  of\n\npotentially  prejudicial  evidence  in criminal  trials).   Thus,\n\nstrong  policy reasons for keeping information about prior crimes\n\nfrom the jury  counselled in favor of our  determination that the\n\nACCA  was a  sentence enhancer,  an issue  to be  decided  by the\n\njudge.\n\n      In addition, under  traditional sentencing procedures, proof\n\nof  a defendant's prior felony  convictions typically is the type\n\nof individual background information considered by the judge, and\n\nnot the jury, see Gov't  of Virgin Islands v. Castillo,  550 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n850, 853 n.5  (3rd Cir. 1977); see  also id. at 854  (noting that\n                                            \n\nadditional language in statutory provision that increased penalty\n\nfor  conduct which  was already a  crime was  in the nature  of a\n\n                               -12-\n\nsentencing statute  rather than  a substantive offense  statute).\n\nCompare United  States v.  Michael, 10 F.3d  838, 842  (D.C. Cir.\n                                  \n\n1993)   (concluding   that  statutory   amendment   singling  out\n\npossession of cocaine base for  especially harsh penalties was  a\n\nseparate element, and not a sentence enhancer, based, in part, on\n\nobservation  that unlike  consideration  of prior  crimes,  whose\n\nadmission   before   the  jury   was   highly  prejudicial,   the\n\ndetermination of the character of  the drug was an aspect of  the\n\nevents associated with  the crime itself, and a  fact that juries\n\ntypically resolve).   And,  as we noted  in Rumney,  \"the primary\n                                                  \n\nrationale  for requiring sentencing factors to  be submitted to a\n\njury -- the necessity for  accurate factfinding -- does not apply\n\nin  the instant case.   Prior  convictions are  highly verifiable\n\nmatters  of record  which need  not be  subject to  jury inquiry.\n\nBecause defendants  had received  the totality of  constitutional\n\nprotections  due   in  the   prior  proceedings,   no  additional\n\nfactfinding  is necessary.\"    867 F.2d  at  719 (quoting  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Brewer, 853 F.2d 1319, 1326 (6th Cir. 1988)).7\n                \n\n      This reasoning  similarly applies here.   If we find that   \n\n1326(b)   is  a  separate  element,  a  defendant's  past  felony\n\n                    \n\n     7As  the Fifth  Circuit has  explained in  the context  of a\nsimilar recidivist statute, prior  convictions \"have no  relation\nto  the circumstances  of the  wrongdoing  constituting the  most\nrecent offense, but rather to something which is wholly unrelated\nthereto.   Further, they  do not relate  to determining  what the\naccused  has  done  but  rather  what the  state  has  previously\n                                                                 \ndetermined that  he has done.   And  that previous  determination\nmust have  been a  formal, judicial determination  of guilt;  and\n                                                           \nhence  one  as  to  which  the  full  measure  of  constitutional\nprotections was available.\"  Buckley v. Butler, 825 F.2d 895, 903\n                                              \n(5th Cir. 1987).\n\n                               -13-\n\nconviction  would  have  to  be  revealed to  the  jury.8    This\n\ninformation  is  especially  prejudicial   where,  as  here,  the\n\nunderlying crime (unlawful  reentry following deportation)  might\n\nnot  be viewed  by the  jury as  particularly egregious.   In the\n\nabsence  of Congressional direction,  we are reluctant  to impose\n\nthat burden  on defendants.   We realize that the  defendant here\n\nargues for a determination that    1326(b) is a separate element.\n\nThe  posture  of   this  particular  case  makes   that  position\n\nstrategically desirable.  But the  omission of an element from an\n\nindictment is an  error easily remedied by  the government, while\n\nthe prejudice  from the  introduction of prior  crimes is  not so\n\neasily neutralized.  In the  long run, we believe that defendants\n\nhave  more to  lose  than  gain from  the  interpretation of  the\n\nprovision urged by Forbes on this appeal.\n\n      Thus,  while we  have no direction from  the statute itself,\n\npolicy and  precedent  persuade  us  that     1326(b)  should  be\n\nconstrued  as a sentence  enhancement provision.   The indictment\n\ntherefore need not  have alleged Forbes' prior  aggravated felony\n\nconviction to permit his sentencing under   1326(b).  \n\n                IV.  Sentencing Guidelines Claims\n                                                 \n\n      Forbes raises three additional claims  of error with  regard\n\nto the  calculation of his  sentence.  First, he  argues that the\n\nsentencing court  erred in increasing  his base offense  level by\n\n                    \n\n     8In some cases,  this may include evidence of  more than one\nconviction.  For example, an aggravated felony within the meaning\nof 8  U.S.C.    1326(b)(2)  might be  made up  of  more than  one\ncriminal act.  See infra at 15-17.\n                        \n\n                               -14-\n\nsixteen points  under guideline  provision 2L1.2(b)(2), based  on\n\nthe finding that Forbes previously was deported after having been\n\nconvicted  for  an aggravated  felony.   Forbes  claims  that the\n\noffense  on which the  government relied  to support  the sixteen\n\npoint  penalty  enhancement  does not  qualify  as  an aggravated\n\nfelony.    Second,  he  contends  that  the  application  of  the\n\naggravated  felony enhancement to this conviction violates the ex\n                                                                 \n\npost facto clause of the Constitution.  Finally, he argues that a\n          \n\n1986  violation for  which he  received  a conditional  discharge\n\nsentence should not have been  included in the calculation of his\n\ncriminal history category.\n\n      As   noted  above,  Forbes  did  not  raise   any  of  these\n\nchallenges before the  district court, and they  consequently are\n\nsubject to only plain error review.  See p. 4 supra.  \n                                                   \n\n                               -15-\n\n               A.  Aggravated felony determination\n                                                  \n\n      The  Sentencing  Guidelines relating  to  offenses  under  8\n\nU.S.C.   1326 are set forth at  U.S.S.G.   2L1.2.  This provision\n\nsets the  base offense level  for unlawful entry into  the United\n\nStates  at  8, with  an  increase of  4 levels  if  the defendant\n\npreviously was deported  after conviction for a felony,  or 16 if\n\nthe defendant  previously was  deported after  conviction for  an\n\naggravated  felony.9    Forbes argues  that  his  1988 conviction\n\nunder N.Y. Penal Law   220.09 (McKinney 1989) does not qualify as\n\nan aggravated  felony.  He  claims, therefore, that  by assigning\n\nhim 16 points for this  conviction, the court overstated his base\n\noffense level.\n\n                    \n\n     9The  offense of  conviction,  8  U.S.C.     1326,  and  the\napplicable  guidelines,  U.S.S.G.      2L1.2,  share  a   similar\nstructure,  but serve  different functions.    Section 1326  sets\nforth the elements  of the offense and the  maximum penalties for\nconvictions  under  this section.    Once  a  defendant has  been\nconvicted, the  guidelines operate to  determine the  appropriate\npenalty within this  range.  In this case,  the guidelines direct\nthe  court to consider  specific offense characteristics  under  \n2L1.2, which include previous deportation following an aggravated\nfelony conviction, in order to determine the applicable guideline\nsentencing range,  see U.S.S.G.     1B1.2(b)  &amp; application  n.2;\n                      \n2L1.2(b)(2).   Under  the guidelines,  courts  may consider  such\ninformation for sentencing  purposes even where this  conduct was\nnot an element of the offense of conviction.  For example,  if we\nwere to hold  that   1326(a) and (b) were  two separate offenses,\nand that Forbes could be convicted and sentenced only under \n   1326(a), we still  could consider his  prior aggravated felony\nconviction in calculating his sentence under 2L1.2.  The sentence\nwe  could impose  however, would have  to be within  the two year\nrange set forth  in   1326(a).   See United States v.  Arias, 941\n                                                            \nF.2d 996 (9th Cir.  1991) (holding that defendants'  prior felony\nconvictions, though not  encompassed within a conviction  under  \n1326(a),  could  still  be  considered in  computing  defendants'\nsentence  under  U.S.S.G.    2L1.2,  provided  that  the sentence\nimposed did  not exceed  the two-year  statutory maximum  under  \n1326(a)).\n\n                               -16-\n\n      \"Aggravated  felony\"  is  defined  in  paragraph  7  of  the\n\nApplication Notes to   2L1.2 to include \"any  illicit trafficking\n\nin any  controlled  substance  (as defined  in  21  U.S.C.  802),\n\nincluding any drug trafficking crime  as defined in 18 U.S.C. 924\n\n(c)(2) . . . \" and applies to offenses in violation of federal or\n\nstate law.\n\n      A  \"drug  trafficking  crime\"  is  defined  in  18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c)(2)  to include \"any felony punishable under the Controlled\n\nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances\n\nImport and  Export Act (21 U.S.C.  951 et seq.), or  the Maritime\n\nDrug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.  App. 1901 et seq.).\"  For  a\n\ndrug offense to come within  this statute, and, in turn,  to meet\n\nthe definition of \"aggravated felony,\" it must meet two criteria:\n\nfirst, the  offense must be  punishable under one of  these three\n\nenumerated statutes; and  second, the offense  must be a  felony.\n\nAmaral v. I.N.S., 977 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                \n\n      Forbes   argues  that   the  New   York  offense,   Criminal\n\nPossession of  a Controlled Substance in the  Fourth Degree, does\n\nnot meet either criterion, and  therefore should not be construed\n\nas  an  aggravated  felony.    His  argument  fails   because  it\n\nmisapprehends  the   operation  of   the  applicable   sentencing\n\nguideline.\n\n      Possession of drugs is punishable under  21 U.S.C.   844(a),\n\na part of the Controlled  Substances Act.

Any person who violates  this subsection may\n      be sentenced  to a term of  imprisonment of not  more than 1\n      year,  and shall  be fined  a minimum  of $1,000,  or  both,\n      except  that  if  he  commits  such  offense  after a  prior\n      conviction under  this subchapter or  subchapter II  of this\n      chapter,  or a  prior conviction  for any  drug or  narcotic\n      offense  chargeable under  the law  of any State  has become\n      final, he shall be  sentenced to a term of imprisonment  for\n      not less than 15 days  but not more than  2 years, and shall\n      be fined a minimum of $2,500 . . . .\n\n      A felony  is defined under  the Controlled Substances Act as\n\n\"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or\n\nState Law as a  felony.\"  21 U.S.C.   802(13).  Under 18 U.S.C.  \n\n3559(a), an  offense is a  felony if the maximum  term authorized\n\nfor the offense  is \"more  than one year.\"   The maximum  penalty\n\nauthorized under 21 U.S.C.    844(a) for simple possession is one\n\nyear.  However, one prior conviction turns simple possession into\n\na felony since  the maximum penalty increases to over a year.  In\n\nthis case,  Forbes' 1987  conviction for  Criminal Possession  of\n\nMarijuana in the Fifth Degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \n\n  221.10  (McKinney 1989),  converts his  later conviction  under\n\nN.Y.  Penal  Law    220.09  into  a  felony.10   Because  Forbes'\n\nconviction  is  a  felony  punishable  by  one  of  the  statutes\n\n                    \n\n     10Moreover,  possession  is  a felony  under  the applicable\nstate law.   In New  York, the maximum imprisonment  for Criminal\nPossession of  a Controlled  Substance in  the  Fourth Degree  is\nfifteen  years, see  N.Y. Penal  Law     220.09 (McKinney  1989),\n                   \n70.00 (McKinney  1987), and  any criminal  offense punishable  by\nmore than one  year is a felony, N.Y. Penal Law   10.00 (McKinney\n1987).   Thus, under  the definition of  a felony in  21 U.S.C.  \n802(13), Forbes' possession  conviction, which is a  felony under\nNew York  Law, is also  a felony under the  Controlled Substances\nAct.\n\n                               -18-\n\nenumerated in 18 U.S.C    924(c)(2), it therefore qualifies as an\n\naggravated felony within the meaning of U.S.S.G.   2L1.2.\n\n                               -19-\n\n                 B.  Ex post facto determination\n                                                \n\n      The  ex post  facto provision  of the  Constitution bars the\n                         \n\nretrospective application  of laws  that materially  disadvantage\n\nthe defendant.  See  U.S. Const., Art. I,    9, cl. 3; Art.  I,  \n                   \n\n10, cl. 1.  A central concern of the ex post facto prohibition is\n                                                  \n\nto  assure  that legislative  acts  \"give fair  warning  of their\n\neffect  and permit  individuals to  rely  on their  meaning until\n\nexplicitly changed.\"  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430 (1987)\n                                       \n\n(quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28-29 (1981)).\n                         \n\n      Forbes  argues that  the use  of  his prior  convictions  to\n\ntrigger  the  aggravated   felony  enhancement  provision  of    \n\n1326(b)(2) violates the  ex post facto provision both because the\n                                      \n\nconvictions on which this enhancement was based occurred prior to\n\nthe  effective date of  the amendments adding  subsection (b)(2),\n\nand  because  he  had  no  fair warning  of  the  possible  post-\n\nconviction  effects of the  aggravated felony determination.   In\n\nsupport of his  claimed lack of \"fair warning,\"  Forbes points to\n\nhis comment to the district  judge at his sentencing hearing that\n\nhe had  not been told by the immigration  judge that he was being\n\ndeported \"on an aggravated felony.\" \n\n      In Gryger v. Burke,  334 U.S. 728 (1948), the Supreme  Court\n                        \n\naddressed  Forbes'  first  argument  in the  context  of  a state\n\nhabitual criminal act.   In that case, the  Court upheld, against\n\nan ex post  facto challenge,  a state  habitual criminal  statute\n                 \n\nenhancing  penalties for  crimes on  the  basis of  a defendant's\n\nprior  criminal convictions, including  one which occurred before\n\n                               -20-\n\nthe  enactment of  the  statute.    Id.  at  732.    Gryger  thus\n                                                           \n\nrecognized  the  legislature's  authority to  enact  an  enhanced\n\npenalty  for future  conduct preceded  by  a criminal  conviction\n\nobtained  prior to enactment  of the enhanced  penalty provision.\n\nSee Covington v. Sullivan, 823 F.2d 37, 39 (2d Cir. 1987).  \n                         \n\n      Forbes was  convicted of  a violation  of 8  U.S.C.    1326,\n\nwhich applies to  aliens who illegally reenter the  United States\n\nfollowing  deportation.   By  its  terms,  the  amendment  adding\n\nsubsection (b)  applies to  any alien who  enters or  attempts to\n\nenter the United States after November  18, 1988 (the date of the\n\nAct's enactment). See Pub. L.  100-690, Title VII,   7345(b), 102\n                     \n\nStat. 4471.  Forbes violated  this statute by attempting to enter\n\nthe  United  States  illegally  on September  20,  1992,  and the\n\ndistrict court  enhanced  his  punishment  based  on  convictions\n\nentered prior to the effective date of the Act.  \n\n      Forbes  cannot  claim that  subsection  (b)(2)  \"makes  more\n\nonerous   the  punishment   for  crimes   committed  before   its\n\nenactment.\"  Weaver, 450  U.S. at 36.   Forbes is being  punished\n                   \n\nfor the  crime of unlawful reentry, in violation  of   1326.  The\n\nenhancement provision  increases the punishment  for this  crime.\n                                                         \n\nIt does  not affect the  punishment that Forbes received  for the\n\ncrimes he  committed prior to the effective date  of the Act.  As\n\nthe Gryger Court observed,  the fact that prior convictions  that\n          \n\nfactored  into  a  defendant's increased  sentence  preceded  the\n\nenactment of  an enhancement  provision does not  render the  Act\n\ninvalidly retroactive.   334  U.S. at 732.   Rather,  an enhanced\n\n                               -21-\n\npenalty  \"is  not  to  be viewed  as  either  a  new jeopardy  or\n\nadditional penalty  for the  earlier crimes.   It is  a stiffened\n\npenalty  for the  latest  crime,  which is  considered  to be  an\n\naggravated offense because a repetitive one.\"  Id.\n                                                  \n\n      Nor does  Forbes' claim that he  lacked fair warning of  the\n\napplication of the aggravated felony provision  to his crime have\n\nmerit.   He may,  in fact, have  been unaware  of this;  but fair\n\nnotice,  as the  sentencing judge  stated, is  \"what the  statute\n\nsays, not what the  immigration officer might tell you.\"   At the\n\ntime  of Forbes'  unlawful reentry,    1326  plainly provided  an\n\nenhanced sentence  based on  prior conviction  for an  aggravated\n\nfelony.\n\n                C.  Conditional discharge sentence\n                                                  \n\n      Forbes' final  claim is  that the  district  court erred  in\n\ncalculating  his criminal  history by  factoring  in one  offense\n\nlevel  point for a  prior conditional discharge  sentence that he\n\nreceived for pleading guilty to Unlawful Possession of Marijuana,\n\nin violation  of N.Y.  Penal Law    221.05  (McKinney 1989).   He\n\nclaims that this  disposition was not a  criminal conviction, and\n\ntherefore does  not justify a  point under  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(c),\n\nwhich  adds  one  point  for  each  sentence  received  following\n\ncriminal conviction.  \n\n      We  need not reach  the merits of  this claim  because it is\n\nevident that  no plain  error occurred.   Forbes points  out that\n\nexcluding  the  challenged violation  from  his  criminal history\n\ncategory  would reduce his designated sentencing range from 46-57\n\n                               -22-\n\nmonths to  41-51 months.   The sentence imposed, after  the court\n\ndeparted  downward, was  only  36 months.   Because  the sentence\n\nForbes  received is  still below  the guidelines  range  which he\n\nadvocates as correct,  we can find no plain error.  See Carrozza,\n                                                                \n\n4 F.3d at 87-91.  \n\n      The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                     \n\n                               -23-\n",

Sec. 1326.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1992, Robert George Forbes, a Jamaican citizen, was deported from New York to Jamaica.  The following month, Forbes attempted to reenter the United States with a false passport that had been altered to include his picture.  A federal grand jury in the District of Puerto Rico subsequently returned a two count indictment against Forbes, charging him with unlawfully using an altered passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1543, and with unlawfully attempting to reenter the United States after having previously been arrested and deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1992, Forbes entered into a plea agreement, in which he pled guilty only to the charge of unlawfully entering the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  As part of his plea, Forbes waived his right to appeal \"any legal sentence imposed by the Court under the Sentencing Guidelines as a result of this Plea Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' presentence report (PSR) computed his total offense level at 21:  8 points were assigned as the base offense level for convictions under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, 16 points were added for his previous deportation after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and 3 points were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility and timely notifying authorities of his intention to plead guilty.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 2L1.2(a), (b)(2);  3E1.1(b)(2).  The PSR also recommended a criminal history category of III, based on 4 criminal history points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5, Part A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing held on March 12, 1993, the district court adopted the recommendations of the PSR, and determined the corresponding sentencing guidelines range to be 46-57 months.  Based on evidence of Forbes' cooperation with the government in other cases, and his continued willingness to cooperate in the future, the sentencing judge departed downward from the applicable guideline range, and imposed a sentence of 36 months plus three years of supervised release.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes argues that the waiver of his right to appeal is ineffective, because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made;  and that, even were the waiver effective, he still has a right to appeal his sentence, because the court erred in applying the Sentencing Guidelines to compute his sentence.  He also claims that the government's failure to allege in his indictment the aggravated felony used to enhance his sentence under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) renders the indictment sufficient only to charge him with a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  Forbes' final claim is that the use of a prior felony conviction to enhance his sentence under Sec. 1326 violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Waiver Provision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the waiver provision in Forbes' plea agreement is narrow, covering only the right to appeal any legal sentence imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines.  We need not reach the question of whether his waiver was knowing and voluntary, nor whether Forbes' claims lie beyond the scope of this waiver, because his appeal suffers from a more fundamental defect.  Because he failed to raise any of these claimed errors before the district court, with the exception of his challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment, see infra at 1296-1300, we cannot correct them absent a showing of plain error, United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 86-87 (1st Cir.1993).  As we discuss below, Forbes has failed to make such a showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Forbes' Section 1326 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes pled guilty to one count of unlawful reentry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, the full text of which is set forth in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Subsection (b) of this provision was added by Congress as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, see Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b) (1988)).  Forbes' indictment alleged only unlawful reentry following deportation, and did not include any reference to his prior aggravated felony conviction.  Forbes claims that the government's failure to allege the prior aggravated felony that permitted it to sentence him within the limits set forth under subsection (b)(2) renders the indictment sufficient only to charge a violation of Sec. 1326(a), and requires that his sentence be contained within the statutory maximum set forth by that subsection.  If, as Forbes contends, Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) describe separate and distinct offenses, his sentence cannot stand, because he cannot be sentenced and convicted under a statutory provision under which he has not been indicted.  Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2907, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974);  United States v. McDonough, 959 F.2d 1137, 1140-41 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government replies that Forbes' failure to present this issue before the district court bars this court from considering it on appeal.  It claims, further, that Sec. 1326 describes only a single offense, and that subsection (b) is a sentence enhancement provision, which permits the court to increase the penalties for a violation depending on the defendant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' failure to point out perceived defects in the indictment does not preclude our consideration of this argument on appeal.  Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2), an objection that an indictment fails to state an essential element of an offense \"shall be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of the proceedings.\"   This objection may be raised by a defendant for the first time on appeal, United States v. Seuss, 474 F.2d 385, 387 n. 2 (1st Cir.1973), or by an appeals court sua sponte, see United States v. Saade, 652 F.2d 1126, 1133 (1st Cir.1981) (citing cases).  When such an objection is urged for the first time on appeal, courts have required that indictments be construed liberally, finding an indictment to be sufficient unless there is no reasonable construction by which it could charge an offense for which the defendant was convicted.  See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 884 F.2d 174, 179-181 (5th Cir.1989).  While statutory citation, standing alone, cannot substitute for setting forth the elements of a crime, it may reinforce other references in the indictment so as to render it valid.  United States v. McLennan, 672 F.2d 239, 243-44 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' indictment follows the language of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  It makes no reference to the fact that Forbes was deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony.  If, as Forbes maintains, an aggravated felony conviction is an element of a Sec. 1326(b) offense, his indictment is insufficient, because it fails to set out an essential element of an offense under that section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) describe separate criminal offenses, with different elements and maximum penalties, or a single offense, allowing sentence enhancement based on a defendant's criminal history, is an issue of first impression in this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The District Court for the District of Rhode Island, the only court within our circuit to address this issue, recently held that Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) set forth separate and distinct offenses, with different elements and maximum penalties.  United States v. Vieira-Candelario, 811 F.Supp. 762, 768 (D.R.I.1993).  The Fifth and the Ninth Circuits, both of which have tackled this issue in the past two years, have come to opposite conclusions.  See United States v. Campos-Martinez, 976 F.2d 589 (9th Cir.1992) (sections 1326(a) and (b) state separate crimes);  United States v. Gonzalez-Medina, 976 F.2d 570 (9th Cir.1992) (same)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>;  United States v.

See, e.g., United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714, 717-18 (1st Cir.1989) (examining these factors in holding that provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 was a sentence enhancer, and not a separate offense).  We have noted that particular structural features, such as a penalty that is a multiplier of the sentence for the underlying crime, or a title denoting it as a sentence enhancement provision, may indicate that a statutory provision is a sentence enhancer, but we have not treated these features as conclusive.  See id. at 718-19.   Our analysis begins with the statute's language and structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the language and structure are unhelpful, because the provisions are subject to two plausible readings.  The first was adopted by the Fifth Circuit and used to support its conclusion that subsection (b) is a sentence enhancement provision.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 946.   That court noted that, in drafting the introductory language of subsections (a) and (b), Congress intertwined the two provisions:  the introductory language of subsection (a) states \"subject to subsection (b) of this section,\" and the introductory language of subsection (b) states, \"Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section.\"   The Fifth Circuit found that it would be \"highly unlikely that Congress would structure the statute in such a way that subsection (b) is dependent on elements of subsection (a), if it intended for subsection (b) to be a separate criminal offense.\"  Id.;  accord Crawford, 815 F.Supp. at 923.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe it just as likely, however, that subsection (b) incorporates the offense described in subsection (a), and simply adds the additional element regarding a prior conviction of a felony or aggravated felony.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 948 (King, J. dissenting);   see also Vieira-Candelario, 811 F.Supp. at 767 (finding the statute's plain language ambiguous).  The fact that each subsection makes reference to the other is simply the logical way of indicating the relationship between the arguably two separate crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the title of the statute offer sufficient guidance about whether subsection (b) is a sentence enhancer or a separate element of the crime.  Before 1988, the statute was entitled \"Reentry of deported alien.\"   In 1988, the statute was amended to add subsection (b), and to change the title to \"Reentry of deported alien;  criminal penalties for reentry of certain deported aliens.\"   One court has argued that this change in the title indicates that in amending Sec. 1326, Congress intended to create enhanced penalties for certain aliens who committed the underlying offense of unlawfully reentering the United States following deportation.  Crawford, 815 F.Supp. at 924;  see also United States v. Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 945.   While this argument has some force, we think that a competing interpretation is equally permissible.  The bifurcated structure of Sec. 1326 and the apparent incorporation of the elements of subsection (a) into subsection (b) might also suggest that Congress intended the broad title of the offense (\"reentry of deported alien\") to apply to both separate offenses in the different subsections.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 949 (King, J., dissenting).  Finally, we have not found any legislative history discussing this particular aspect of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking insight from the language, structure and legislative history we are compelled to take a broader look at the factors implicated by a decision to classify a provision either as a sentence enhancer or a separate crime.  In so doing, we have found guidance in a previous decision of this court addressing a similar issue.  In United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714 (1st Cir.1989), we were asked to determine whether the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(a) (Supp.1984) (ACCA)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>, was a sentence enhancer or a separate substantive crime.  Section 1202(a) penalized receipt, possession, or transportation of firearms by those with prior felony convictions.  The ACCA amended this statute to increase the minimum penalty for a person who \"receives, possesses, or transports in commerce ... any firearm and who has three previous felony convictions.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(a) (Supp.1984).  Rumney, like Forbes, challenged his sentence under the higher maximum, arguing that the government's failure to allege three prior convictions in the indictment rendered the indictment insufficient to charge a violation of the ACCA.  867 F.2d at 717.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We resolved the question in Rumney primarily based on legislative history, which demonstrated Congress' intent that the ACCA be a sentence enhancer, and not a separate statutory element.  We also observed, however, that the special nature of the disputed prior crimes provision further supported its classification as a sentence enhancer.  Rumney, 867 F.2d 714, 718-19;  see also United States v. Jackson, 824 F.2d 21, 25-26 (D.C.Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We felt it significant that if the disputed provision were deemed a separate element, the government would be required to place evidence of the defendant's prior felony convictions before the jury.  The introduction of prior crimes evidence is highly prejudicial, and should not be permitted lightly, Rumney, 867 F.2d at 719;  see also Jackson, 824 F.2d at 25 (noting strong Congressional policy of avoiding introduction of this type of potentially prejudicial evidence in criminal trials).  Thus, strong policy reasons for keeping information about prior crimes from the jury counselled in favor of our determination that the ACCA was a sentence enhancer, an issue to be decided by the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, under traditional sentencing procedures, proof of a defendant's prior felony convictions typically is the type of individual background information considered by the judge, and not the jury, see Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Castillo, 550 F.2d 850, 853 n. 5 (3rd Cir.1977);  see also id. at 854 (noting that additional language in statutory provision that increased penalty for conduct which was already a crime was in the nature of a sentencing statute rather than a substantive offense statute).  Compare United States v. Michael, 10 F.3d 838, 842 (D.C.Cir.1993) (concluding that statutory amendment singling out possession of cocaine base for especially harsh penalties was a separate element, and not a sentence enhancer, based, in part, on observation that unlike consideration of prior crimes, whose admission before the jury was highly prejudicial, the determination of the character of the drug was an aspect of the events associated with the crime itself, and a fact that juries typically resolve).  And, as we noted in Rumney, \"the primary rationale for requiring sentencing factors to be submitted to a jury--the necessity for accurate factfinding--does not apply in the instant case.  Prior convictions are highly verifiable matters of record which need not be subject to jury inquiry.  Because defendants had received the totality of constitutional protections due in the prior proceedings, no additional factfinding is necessary.\"  867 F.2d at 719 (quoting United States v. Brewer, 853 F.2d 1319, 1326 (6th Cir.1988)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning similarly applies here.  If we find that Sec. 1326(b) is a separate element, a defendant's past felony conviction would have to be revealed to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  This information is especially prejudicial where, as here, the underlying crime (unlawful reentry following deportation) might not be viewed by the jury as particularly egregious.  In the absence of Congressional direction, we are reluctant to impose that burden on defendants.  We realize that the defendant here argues for a determination that Sec. 1326(b) is a separate element.  The posture of this particular case makes that position strategically desirable.  But the omission of an element from an indictment is an error easily remedied by the government, while the prejudice from the introduction of prior crimes is not so easily neutralized.  In the long run, we believe that defendants have more to lose than gain from the interpretation of the provision urged by Forbes on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while we have no direction from the statute itself, policy and precedent persuade us that Sec. 1326(b) should be construed as a sentence enhancement provision.  The indictment therefore need not have alleged Forbes' prior aggravated felony conviction to permit his sentencing under Sec. 1326(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Sentencing Guidelines Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes raises three additional claims of error with regard to the calculation of his sentence.  First, he argues that the sentencing court erred in increasing his base offense level by sixteen points under guideline provision 2L1.2(b)(2), based on the finding that Forbes previously was deported after having been convicted for an aggravated felony.  Forbes claims that the offense on which the government relied to support the sixteen point penalty enhancement does not qualify as an aggravated felony.  Second, he contends that the application of the aggravated felony enhancement to this conviction violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  Finally, he argues that a 1986 violation for which he received a conditional discharge sentence should not have been included in the calculation of his criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Forbes did not raise any of these challenges before the district court, and they consequently are subject to only plain error review.  See p. 1296 supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Aggravated felony determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines relating to offenses under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326 are set forth at U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2.  This provision sets the base offense level for unlawful entry into the United States at 8, with an increase of 4 levels if the defendant previously was deported after conviction for a felony, or 16 if the defendant previously was deported after conviction for an aggravated felony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Forbes argues that his 1988 conviction under N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 220.09 (McKinney 1989) does not qualify as an aggravated felony.  He claims, therefore, that by assigning him 16 points for this conviction, the court overstated his base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Aggravated felony\" is defined in paragraph 7 of the Application Notes to Sec. 2L1.2 to include \"any illicit trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802), including any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(2) ...\" and applies to offenses in violation of federal or state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"drug trafficking crime\" is defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(2) to include \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.App.1901 et seq.).\"   For a drug offense to come within this statute, and, in turn, to meet the definition of \"aggravated felony,\" it must meet two criteria:  first, the offense must be punishable under one of these three enumerated statutes;  and second, the offense must be a felony.  Amaral v. I.N.S., 977 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes argues that the New York offense, Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Fourth Degree, does not meet either criterion, and therefore should not be construed as an aggravated felony.  His argument fails because it misapprehends the operation of the applicable sentencing guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possession of drugs is punishable under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844(a), a part of the Controlled Substances Act.  This statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless such substance was obtained directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription order, from a practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.  Any person who violates this subsection may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 1 year, and shall be fined a minimum of $1,000, or both, except that if he commits such offense after a prior conviction under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, or a prior conviction for any drug or narcotic offense chargeable under the law of any State has become final, he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than 15 days but not more than 2 years, and shall be fined a minimum of $2,500....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A felony is defined under the Controlled Substances Act as \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State Law as a felony.\"  21 U.S.C. Sec. 802(13).  Under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3559(a), an offense is a felony if the maximum term authorized for the offense is \"more than one year.\"   The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844(a) for simple possession is one year.  However, one prior conviction turns simple possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.  In this case, Forbes' 1987 conviction for Criminal Possession of Marijuana in the Fifth Degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 221.10 (McKinney 1989), converts his later conviction under N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 220.09 into a felony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because Forbes' conviction is a felony punishable by one of the statutes enumerated in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(2), it therefore qualifies as an aggravated felony within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Ex post facto determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ex post facto provision of the Constitution bars the retrospective application of laws that materially disadvantage the defendant.  See U.S. Const., Art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3;  Art.  I, Sec. 10, cl. 1.  A central concern of the ex post facto prohibition is to assure that legislative acts \"give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.\"  Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987) (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28-29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 963-64, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes argues that the use of his prior convictions to trigger the aggravated felony enhancement provision of Sec. 1326(b)(2) violates the ex post facto provision both because the convictions on which this enhancement was based occurred prior to the effective date of the amendments adding subsection (b)(2), and because he had no fair warning of the possible post-conviction effects of the aggravated felony determination.  In support of his claimed lack of \"fair warning,\" Forbes points to his comment to the district judge at his sentencing hearing that he had not been told by the immigration judge that he was being deported \"on an aggravated felony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gryger v. Burke, 334 U.S. 728, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683 (1948), the Supreme Court addressed Forbes' first argument in the context of a state habitual criminal act.  In that case, the Court upheld, against an ex post facto challenge, a state habitual criminal statute enhancing penalties for crimes on the basis of a defendant's prior criminal convictions, including one which occurred before the enactment of the statute.  Id. at 732, 68 S.Ct. at 1258-59.  Gryger thus recognized the legislature's authority to enact an enhanced penalty for future conduct preceded by a criminal conviction obtained prior to enactment of the enhanced penalty provision.  See Covington v. Sullivan, 823 F.2d 37, 39 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes was convicted of a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, which applies to aliens who illegally reenter the United States following deportation.  By its terms, the amendment adding subsection (b) applies to any alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States after November 18, 1988 (the date of the Act's enactment).  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471.  Forbes violated this statute by attempting to enter the United States illegally on September 20, 1992, and the district court enhanced his punishment based on convictions entered prior to the effective date of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes cannot claim that subsection (b)(2) \"makes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.\"    Weaver, 450 U.S. at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 968.   Forbes is being punished for the crime of unlawful reentry, in violation of Sec. 1326.  The enhancement provision increases the punishment for this crime.  It does not affect the punishment that Forbes received for the crimes he committed prior to the effective date of the Act.  As the Gryger Court observed, the fact that prior convictions that factored into a defendant's increased sentence preceded the enactment of an enhancement provision does not render the Act invalidly retroactive.  334 U.S. at 732, 68 S.Ct. at 1258-59.   Rather, an enhanced penalty \"is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes.  It is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Forbes' claim that he lacked fair warning of the application of the aggravated felony provision to his crime have merit.  He may, in fact, have been unaware of this;  but fair notice, as the sentencing judge stated, is \"what the statute says, not what the immigration officer might tell you.\"   At the time of Forbes' unlawful reentry, Sec. 1326 plainly provided an enhanced sentence based on prior conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Conditional discharge sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' final claim is that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history by factoring in one offense level point for a prior conditional discharge sentence that he received for pleading guilty to Unlawful Possession of Marijuana, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 221.05 (McKinney 1989).  He claims that this disposition was not a criminal conviction, and therefore does not justify a point under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c), which adds one point for each sentence received following criminal conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the merits of this claim because it is evident that no plain error occurred.  Forbes points out that excluding the challenged violation from his criminal history category would reduce his designated sentencing range from 46-57 months to 41-51 months.  The sentence imposed, after the court departed downward, was only 36 months.  Because the sentence Forbes received is still below the guidelines range which he advocates as correct, we can find no plain error.

Further, they do not relate to determining what the accused has done but rather what the state has previously determined that he has done.  And that previous determination must have been a formal, judicial determination of guilt;  and hence one as to which the full measure of constitutional protections was available.\"  Buckley v.

For example, an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) might be made up of more than one criminal act.  See infra at 1300-1301</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The offense of conviction, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, and the applicable guidelines, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, share a similar structure, but serve different functions.  Section 1326 sets forth the elements of the offense and the maximum penalties for convictions under this section.  Once a defendant has been convicted, the guidelines operate to determine the appropriate penalty within this range.  In this case, the guidelines direct the court to consider specific offense characteristics under Sec. 2L1.2, which include previous deportation following an aggravated felony conviction, in order to determine the applicable guideline sentencing range, see U.S.S.G. Secs. 1B1.2(b) &amp; application n. 2;  2L1.2(b)(2).  Under the guidelines, courts may consider such information for sentencing purposes even where this conduct was not an element of the offense of conviction.  For example, if we were to hold that Sec. 1326(a) and (b) were two separate offenses, and that Forbes could be convicted and sentenced only under Sec. 1326(a), we still could consider his prior aggravated felony conviction in calculating his sentence under 2L1.2.  The sentence we could impose however, would have to be within the two year range set forth in Sec. 1326(a).  See United States v. Arias-Granados, 941 F.2d 996 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that defendants' prior felony convictions, though not encompassed within a conviction under Sec. 1326(a), could still be considered in computing defendants' sentence under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, provided that the sentence imposed did not exceed the two-year statutory maximum under Sec. 1326(a))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Moreover, possession is a felony under the applicable state law.  In New York, the maximum imprisonment for Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Fourth Degree is fifteen years, see N.Y.

Thus, under the definition of a felony in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 802(13), Forbes' possession conviction, which is a felony under New York Law, is also a felony under the Controlled Substances Act</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1326.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1992, Robert George Forbes, a Jamaican citizen, was deported from New York to Jamaica.  The following month, Forbes attempted to reenter the United States with a false passport that had been altered to include his picture.  A federal grand jury in the District of Puerto Rico subsequently returned a two count indictment against Forbes, charging him with unlawfully using an altered passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1543, and with unlawfully attempting to reenter the United States after having previously been arrested and deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1992, Forbes entered into a plea agreement, in which he pled guilty only to the charge of unlawfully entering the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  As part of his plea, Forbes waived his right to appeal \"any legal sentence imposed by the Court under the Sentencing Guidelines as a result of this Plea Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' presentence report (PSR) computed his total offense level at 21:  8 points were assigned as the base offense level for convictions under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, 16 points were added for his previous deportation after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and 3 points were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility and timely notifying authorities of his intention to plead guilty.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 2L1.2(a), (b)(2);  3E1.1(b)(2).  The PSR also recommended a criminal history category of III, based on 4 criminal history points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5, Part A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing held on March 12, 1993, the district court adopted the recommendations of the PSR, and determined the corresponding sentencing guidelines range to be 46-57 months.  Based on evidence of Forbes' cooperation with the government in other cases, and his continued willingness to cooperate in the future, the sentencing judge departed downward from the applicable guideline range, and imposed a sentence of 36 months plus three years of supervised release.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes argues that the waiver of his right to appeal is ineffective, because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made;  and that, even were the waiver effective, he still has a right to appeal his sentence, because the court erred in applying the Sentencing Guidelines to compute his sentence.  He also claims that the government's failure to allege in his indictment the aggravated felony used to enhance his sentence under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2) renders the indictment sufficient only to charge him with a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  Forbes' final claim is that the use of a prior felony conviction to enhance his sentence under Sec. 1326 violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Waiver Provision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the waiver provision in Forbes' plea agreement is narrow, covering only the right to appeal any legal sentence imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines.  We need not reach the question of whether his waiver was knowing and voluntary, nor whether Forbes' claims lie beyond the scope of this waiver, because his appeal suffers from a more fundamental defect.  Because he failed to raise any of these claimed errors before the district court, with the exception of his challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment, see infra at 1296-1300, we cannot correct them absent a showing of plain error, United States v. Carrozza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629118\"><a href=\"/opinion/629118/united-states-v-robert-f-carrozza-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 86-87 (1st Cir.1993).  As we discuss below, Forbes has failed to make such a showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Forbes' Section 1326 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes pled guilty to one count of unlawful reentry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, the full text of which is set forth in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Subsection (b) of this provision was added by Congress as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, see Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b) (1988)).  Forbes' indictment alleged only unlawful reentry following deportation, and did not include any reference to his prior aggravated felony conviction.  Forbes claims that the government's failure to allege the prior aggravated felony that permitted it to sentence him within the limits set forth under subsection (b)(2) renders the indictment sufficient only to charge a violation of Sec. 1326(a), and requires that his sentence be contained within the statutory maximum set forth by that subsection.  If, as Forbes contends, Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) describe separate and distinct offenses, his sentence cannot stand, because he cannot be sentenced and convicted under a statutory provision under which he has not been indicted.

It claims, further, that Sec. 1326 describes only a single offense, and that subsection (b) is a sentence enhancement provision, which permits the court to increase the penalties for a violation depending on the defendant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' failure to point out perceived defects in the indictment does not preclude our consideration of this argument on appeal.  Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2), an objection that an indictment fails to state an essential element of an offense \"shall be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of the proceedings.\"   This objection may be raised by a defendant for the first time on appeal, United States v. Seuss, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"308736\"><a href=\"/opinion/308736/united-states-v-harry-f-seuss/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 387 n. 2 (1st Cir.1973), or by an appeals court sua sponte, see United States v.

When such an objection is urged for the first time on appeal, courts have required that indictments be construed liberally, finding an indictment to be sufficient unless there is no reasonable construction by which it could charge an offense for which the defendant was convicted.  See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span>, 179-181 (5th Cir.1989).  While statutory citation, standing alone, cannot substitute for setting forth the elements of a crime, it may reinforce other references in the indictment so as to render it valid.  United States v. McLennan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400081\"><a href=\"/opinion/400081/united-states-v-earl-mclennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 243-44 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' indictment follows the language of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a).  It makes no reference to the fact that Forbes was deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony.  If, as Forbes maintains, an aggravated felony conviction is an element of a Sec. 1326(b) offense, his indictment is insufficient, because it fails to set out an essential element of an offense under that section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) describe separate criminal offenses, with different elements and maximum penalties, or a single offense, allowing sentence enhancement based on a defendant's criminal history, is an issue of first impression in this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The District Court for the District of Rhode Island, the only court within our circuit to address this issue, recently held that Sec. 1326(a) and Sec. 1326(b) set forth separate and distinct offenses, with different elements and maximum penalties.

See, e.g., United States v. Rumney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518388\"><a href=\"/opinion/518388/united-states-v-arthur-w-rumney/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 717-18 (1st Cir.1989) (examining these factors in holding that provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 was a sentence enhancer, and not a separate offense).  We have noted that particular structural features, such as a penalty that is a multiplier of the sentence for the underlying crime, or a title denoting it as a sentence enhancement provision, may indicate that a statutory provision is a sentence enhancer, but we have not treated these features as conclusive.  See id. at 718-19.   Our analysis begins with the statute's language and structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the language and structure are unhelpful, because the provisions are subject to two plausible readings.  The first was adopted by the Fifth Circuit and used to support its conclusion that subsection (b) is a sentence enhancement provision.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 946.   That court noted that, in drafting the introductory language of subsections (a) and (b), Congress intertwined the two provisions:  the introductory language of subsection (a) states \"subject to subsection (b) of this section,\" and the introductory language of subsection (b) states, \"Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section.\"   The Fifth Circuit found that it would be \"highly unlikely that Congress would structure the statute in such a way that subsection (b) is dependent on elements of subsection (a), if it intended for subsection (b) to be a separate criminal offense.\"  Id.;  accord Crawford, 815 F.Supp. at 923.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe it just as likely, however, that subsection (b) incorporates the offense described in subsection (a), and simply adds the additional element regarding a prior conviction of a felony or aggravated felony.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 948 (King, J. dissenting);   see also Vieira-Candelario, 811 F.Supp. at 767 (finding the statute's plain language ambiguous).  The fact that each subsection makes reference to the other is simply the logical way of indicating the relationship between the arguably two separate crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the title of the statute offer sufficient guidance about whether subsection (b) is a sentence enhancer or a separate element of the crime.  Before 1988, the statute was entitled \"Reentry of deported alien.\"   In 1988, the statute was amended to add subsection (b), and to change the title to \"Reentry of deported alien;  criminal penalties for reentry of certain deported aliens.\"   One court has argued that this change in the title indicates that in amending Sec. 1326, Congress intended to create enhanced penalties for certain aliens who committed the underlying offense of unlawfully reentering the United States following deportation.  Crawford, 815 F.Supp. at 924;  see also United States v. Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 945.   While this argument has some force, we think that a competing interpretation is equally permissible.  The bifurcated structure of Sec. 1326 and the apparent incorporation of the elements of subsection (a) into subsection (b) might also suggest that Congress intended the broad title of the offense (\"reentry of deported alien\") to apply to both separate offenses in the different subsections.  Vasquez-Olvera, 999 F.2d at 949 (King, J., dissenting).  Finally, we have not found any legislative history discussing this particular aspect of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking insight from the language, structure and legislative history we are compelled to take a broader look at the factors implicated by a decision to classify a provision either as a sentence enhancer or a separate crime.  In so doing, we have found guidance in a previous decision of this court addressing a similar issue.  In United States v. Rumney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518388\"><a href=\"/opinion/518388/united-states-v-arthur-w-rumney/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), we were asked to determine whether the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(a) (Supp.1984) (ACCA)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>, was a sentence enhancer or a separate substantive crime.  Section 1202(a) penalized receipt, possession, or transportation of firearms by those with prior felony convictions.  The ACCA amended this statute to increase the minimum penalty for a person who \"receives, possesses, or transports in commerce ... any firearm and who has three previous felony convictions.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(a) (Supp.1984).  Rumney, like Forbes, challenged his sentence under the higher maximum, arguing that the government's failure to allege three prior convictions in the indictment rendered the indictment insufficient to charge a violation of the ACCA.  867 F.2d at 717.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We resolved the question in Rumney primarily based on legislative history, which demonstrated Congress' intent that the ACCA be a sentence enhancer, and not a separate statutory element.  We also observed, however, that the special nature of the disputed prior crimes provision further supported its classification as a sentence enhancer.  Rumney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518388\"><a href=\"/opinion/518388/united-states-v-arthur-w-rumney/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 718-19;  see also United States v.

The introduction of prior crimes evidence is highly prejudicial, and should not be permitted lightly, Rumney, 867 F.2d at 719;  see also Jackson, 824 F.2d at 25 (noting strong Congressional policy of avoiding introduction of this type of potentially prejudicial evidence in criminal trials).  Thus, strong policy reasons for keeping information about prior crimes from the jury counselled in favor of our determination that the ACCA was a sentence enhancer, an issue to be decided by the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, under traditional sentencing procedures, proof of a defendant's prior felony convictions typically is the type of individual background information considered by the judge, and not the jury, see Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Castillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343407\"><a href=\"/opinion/343407/government-of-the-virgin-islands-v-david-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 853 n. 5 (3rd Cir.1977);  see also id. at 854 (noting that additional language in statutory provision that increased penalty for conduct which was already a crime was in the nature of a sentencing statute rather than a substantive offense statute).  Compare United States v. Michael, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658292\"><a href=\"/opinion/658292/united-states-v-dennis-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span>, 842 (D.C.Cir.1993) (concluding that statutory amendment singling out possession of cocaine base for especially harsh penalties was a separate element, and not a sentence enhancer, based, in part, on observation that unlike consideration of prior crimes, whose admission before the jury was highly prejudicial, the determination of the character of the drug was an aspect of the events associated with the crime itself, and a fact that juries typically resolve).  And, as we noted in Rumney, \"the primary rationale for requiring sentencing factors to be submitted to a jury--the necessity for accurate factfinding--does not apply in the instant case.  Prior convictions are highly verifiable matters of record which need not be subject to jury inquiry.  Because defendants had received the totality of constitutional protections due in the prior proceedings, no additional factfinding is necessary.\"  867 F.2d at 719 (quoting United States v. Brewer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510062\"><a href=\"/opinion/510062/united-states-v-curtis-lee-brewer-86-6155-james-phillip-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1326 (6th Cir.1988)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning similarly applies here.  If we find that Sec. 1326(b) is a separate element, a defendant's past felony conviction would have to be revealed to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  This information is especially prejudicial where, as here, the underlying crime (unlawful reentry following deportation) might not be viewed by the jury as particularly egregious.  In the absence of Congressional direction, we are reluctant to impose that burden on defendants.  We realize that the defendant here argues for a determination that Sec. 1326(b) is a separate element.  The posture of this particular case makes that position strategically desirable.  But the omission of an element from an indictment is an error easily remedied by the government, while the prejudice from the introduction of prior crimes is not so easily neutralized.  In the long run, we believe that defendants have more to lose than gain from the interpretation of the provision urged by Forbes on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while we have no direction from the statute itself, policy and precedent persuade us that Sec. 1326(b) should be construed as a sentence enhancement provision.  The indictment therefore need not have alleged Forbes' prior aggravated felony conviction to permit his sentencing under Sec. 1326(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

First, he argues that the sentencing court erred in increasing his base offense level by sixteen points under guideline provision 2L1.2(b)(2), based on the finding that Forbes previously was deported after having been convicted for an aggravated felony.  Forbes claims that the offense on which the government relied to support the sixteen point penalty enhancement does not qualify as an aggravated felony.  Second, he contends that the application of the aggravated felony enhancement to this conviction violates the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.  Finally, he argues that a 1986 violation for which he received a conditional discharge sentence should not have been included in the calculation of his criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Forbes did not raise any of these challenges before the district court, and they consequently are subject to only plain error review.  See p. 1296 supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Aggravated felony determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines relating to offenses under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326 are set forth at U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2.  This provision sets the base offense level for unlawful entry into the United States at 8, with an increase of 4 levels if the defendant previously was deported after conviction for a felony, or 16 if the defendant previously was deported after conviction for an aggravated felony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Forbes argues that his 1988 conviction under N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 220.09 (McKinney 1989) does not qualify as an aggravated felony.  He claims, therefore, that by assigning him 16 points for this conviction, the court overstated his base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Aggravated felony\" is defined in paragraph 7 of the Application Notes to Sec. 2L1.2 to include \"any illicit trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802), including any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(2) ...\" and applies to offenses in violation of federal or state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"drug trafficking crime\" is defined in 18 U.S.C.

His argument fails because it misapprehends the operation of the applicable sentencing guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possession of drugs is punishable under 21 U.S.C.

Any person who violates this subsection may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 1 year, and shall be fined a minimum of $1,000, or both, except that if he commits such offense after a prior conviction under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, or a prior conviction for any drug or narcotic offense chargeable under the law of any State has become final, he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than 15 days but not more than 2 years, and shall be fined a minimum of $2,500....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A felony is defined under the Controlled Substances Act as \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State Law as a felony.\"  21 U.S.C. Sec. 802(13).  Under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3559(a), an offense is a felony if the maximum term authorized for the offense is \"more than one year.\"   The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 844(a) for simple possession is one year.  However, one prior conviction turns simple possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.  In this case, Forbes' 1987 conviction for Criminal Possession of Marijuana in the Fifth Degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 221.10 (McKinney 1989), converts his later conviction under N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 220.09 into a felony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because Forbes' conviction is a felony punishable by one of the statutes enumerated in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(2), it therefore qualifies as an aggravated felony within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

See U.S. Const., Art.  I, Sec. 9, cl. 3;  Art.  I, Sec. 10, cl. 1.

In support of his claimed lack of \"fair warning,\" Forbes points to his comment to the district judge at his sentencing hearing that he had not been told by the immigration judge that he was being deported \"on an aggravated felony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gryger v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1683</span></span> (1948), the Supreme Court addressed Forbes' first argument in the context of a state habitual criminal act.  In that case, the Court upheld, against an ex post facto challenge, a state habitual criminal statute enhancing penalties for crimes on the basis of a defendant's prior criminal convictions, including one which occurred before the enactment of the statute.  Id. at 732, 68 S.Ct. at 1258-59.  Gryger thus recognized the legislature's authority to enact an enhanced penalty for future conduct preceded by a criminal conviction obtained prior to enactment of the enhanced penalty provision.  See Covington v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490960\"><a href=\"/opinion/490960/curtis-covington-v-james-e-sullivan-superintendent-of-sing-sing/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes was convicted of a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, which applies to aliens who illegally reenter the United States following deportation.  By its terms, the amendment adding subsection (b) applies to any alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States after November 18, 1988 (the date of the Act's enactment).  See Pub.L. 100-690, Title VII, Sec. 7345(a), 102 Stat. 4471.  Forbes violated this statute by attempting to enter the United States illegally on September 20, 1992, and the district court enhanced his punishment based on convictions entered prior to the effective date of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes cannot claim that subsection (b)(2) \"makes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.\"    Weaver, 450 U.S. at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 968.   Forbes is being punished for the crime of unlawful reentry, in violation of Sec. 1326.  The enhancement provision increases the punishment for this crime.  It does not affect the punishment that Forbes received for the crimes he committed prior to the effective date of the Act.  As the Gryger Court observed, the fact that prior convictions that factored into a defendant's increased sentence preceded the enactment of an enhancement provision does not render the Act invalidly retroactive.  334 U.S. at 732, 68 S.Ct. at 1258-59.   Rather, an enhanced penalty \"is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes.  It is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Forbes' claim that he lacked fair warning of the application of the aggravated felony provision to his crime have merit.  He may, in fact, have been unaware of this;  but fair notice, as the sentencing judge stated, is \"what the statute says, not what the immigration officer might tell you.\"   At the time of Forbes' unlawful reentry, Sec. 1326 plainly provided an enhanced sentence based on prior conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Conditional discharge sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forbes' final claim is that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history by factoring in one offense level point for a prior conditional discharge sentence that he received for pleading guilty to Unlawful Possession of Marijuana, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 221.05 (McKinney 1989).  He claims that this disposition was not a criminal conviction, and therefore does not justify a point under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c), which adds one point for each sentence received following criminal conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the merits of this claim because it is evident that no plain error occurred.  Forbes points out that excluding the challenged violation from his criminal history category would reduce his designated sentencing range from 46-57 months to 41-51 months.  The sentence imposed, after the court departed downward, was only 36 months.  Because the sentence Forbes received is still below the guidelines range which he advocates as correct, we can find no plain error.

Sec. 1326, and the applicable guidelines, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2, share a similar structure, but serve different functions.  Section 1326 sets forth the elements of the offense and the maximum penalties for convictions under this section.  Once a defendant has been convicted, the guidelines operate to determine the appropriate penalty within this range.  In this case, the guidelines direct the court to consider specific offense characteristics under Sec. 2L1.2, which include previous deportation following an aggravated felony conviction, in order to determine the applicable guideline sentencing range, see U.S.S.G. Secs. 1B1.2(b) &amp; application n. 2;  2L1.2(b)(2).  Under the guidelines, courts may consider such information for sentencing purposes even where this conduct was not an element of the offense of conviction.  For example, if we were to hold that Sec. 1326(a) and (b) were two separate offenses, and that Forbes could be convicted and sentenced only under Sec. 1326(a), we still could consider his prior aggravated felony conviction in calculating his sentence under 2L1.2.  The sentence we could impose however, would have to be within the two year range set forth in Sec. 1326(a).  See United States v.

Sec. 2L1.2, provided that the sentence imposed did not exceed the two-year statutory maximum under Sec. 1326(a))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Moreover, possession is a felony under the applicable state law.
