From  a welter  of\n                                      \n\nvarious  claims,  sounding  in   both  contract  and   tort,\n\nAppellant Benefit  Management of Maine, Inc.  (\"Benefit\"), a\n\nretail purveyor  of various insurance products,  here raises\n\nthe  propriety  of two  pre-trial  rulings  as well  as  two\n\naspects of the directed  verdict which ultimately dashed its\n\nhopes.   After a thorough review of the entire trial record,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n               Since the  four issues raised on appeal arise\n\nout  of the  contractual relations  between the  parties, we\n\nsketch  those  matters briefly  at  the  outset  to put  the\n\nfollowing discussion in context.1\n\n               On   or  about  September  9,  1983,  Benefit\n\nexecuted  a  Group  Agency  Agreement  with  Northbrook Life\n\nInsurance  Company (\"Northbrook\").   Under the  Group Agency\n\nAgreement, Benefit  had an exclusive agency  to sell certain\n\nNorthbrook  group health  insurance products  in Maine,  New\n\nHampshire,  and Vermont.    On  or  about  April  13,  1984,\n\n                    \n\n1  As Benefit's case began  to sink on  summary judgment and\nultimately foundered  upon a  directed verdict, we  draw all\nreasonable   inferences   in  Benefit's   favor  throughout.\nContinental  Grain  Co.  v.  Puerto  Rico  Maritime Shipping\n                                                            \nAuth., 972 F.2d 426, 431  (1st Cir. 1992) (inferences  drawn\n     \nagainst  party prevailing  on summary judgment);  DiPalma v.\n                                                         \nWestinghouse Electric  Corp., 938 F.2d 1463,  1464 (1st Cir.\n                            \n1991) (inferences drawn against party prevailing on directed\nverdict).\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nNorthbrook  and  its  parent  Allstate  Life  Insurance  Co.\n\n(\"Allstate\")  contracted  with   Equitable  Life   Assurance\n\nSociety of the United States (\"Equitable\") to have Equitable\n\nagents sell certain insurance products of Northbrook.  Since\n\nthis   Northbrook-Equitable  agreement   arguably  infringed\n\nBenefit's exclusive agency,  Northbrook offered, and Benefit\n\naccepted, an Amended Group Agency Agreement which  permitted\n\nthe  sales by the Equitable Agents in return for a reduction\n\nin  Benefit's franchise  fee  as well  as added  contractual\n\nprotections for Benefit.\n\n               On  March  18,  1988,   Northbrook,  claiming\n\nsevere  business losses,  sent  Benefit a  formal notice  of\n\nwithdrawal  and suspension pursuant  to the  Amended General\n\nAgency  Agreement.2   At the  same time,  Northbrook offered\n\nBenefit a limited Service Agreement (\"the Northbrook Service\n\nAgreement\")  which allowed Benefit certain renewal marketing\n\nand  extended  claims  paying authority  on  the  Northbrook\n\npolicies then in force which were being serviced by Benefit.\n\n                    \n2 This notice stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Current   business  conditions   have  caused\n       Northbrook  to  revaluate  its  Group  Agency\n       operations, resulting in our  withdrawal from\n       the small-to-medium sized employer group life\n       and health insurance market in certain market\n       territories.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nLikewise, Allstate offered Benefit a service agreement (\"the\n\nAllstate Service Agreement\") which granted Benefit marketing\n\nand  claims  administration  authority  for  certain  future\n\ninsurance business under the Allstate name.\n\n               Benefit was reluctant to enter into these two\n\nservice   agreements   (collectively   the   \"1988   Service\n\nAgreements\") since the  offer was extended  for but a  short\n\ntime and  then on a 'take  it or leave it  basis,' and since\n\nthe termination  provisions were  less favorable to  Benefit\n\nthan those found in  the  Amended General  Agency Agreement.\n\nThe   alternative,   however,   was   no   further  business\n\nrelationship at all  with a most lucrative  account.3  Since\n\nAllstate  was  dangling  the   prospect  of  a  longer  term\n\nrelationship,4 Benefit signed.\n\n                    \n3 During 1988, Benefit derived more than 65% of its revenues\nfrom its Northbrook  business --  a sum  of over  $2,000,000\nfrom  which Benefit  received  commissions of  approximately\n$665,000.\n\n4 Allstate's agents communicated with Benefit as follows:\n\n       The term of the new Allstate contract is one year.\n       We anticipate that during this year  major changes\n       will   evolve  in   our  strategy   of  healthcare\n       delivery.  . .  .   This  provision  has not  been\n       included with  the idea  of terminating  without a\n       continuation option.   It  has been placed  in the\n       contract to prompt renegotiation more favorable to\n       all  parties when  the cycle  is complete  and our\n       local market strategy is solidified.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n               Less  than  two months  later  Northbrook and\n\nAllstate  gave notice  that they  were terminating  the 1988\n\nService Agreements with Benefit.\n\n               This action ensued,  Benefit charging,  among\n\nother  claims, breach of contract and fraud.  Certain of its\n\nclaims   succumbed  to   summary  judgment;   the  remainder\n\ncollapsed  when  the District  Court  allowed  a motion  for\n\ndirected  verdict  in  favor  of  Northbrook  and  Allstate.\n\nBenefit's appeal raises four issues.\n\n          1.  Denial  by the Magistrate  Judge of  Benefit's\n                                                            \n\nMotion\n      \n\n              to Compel\n                       \n\n               On April 23, 1991, in the course of preparing\n\nfor  trial, Benefit  moved to  compel discovery  of fourteen\n\ndocuments  which Allstate  and Northbrook had  withheld from\n\nproduction on the  grounds that they  were protected by  the\n\nattorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine.  In\n\nsupport  of its  motion, Benefit  argued that  the documents\n\nwere subject to the crime-fraud exception to the privilege.\n\n               After a  hearing and  an in camera  review of\n                                                 \n\nthe documents, the Magistrate Judge denied the motion due to\n\nBenefit's failure to make  the requisite prima facie showing\n                                                    \n\nof fraud.   On  June 10,  1991, Benefit  filed a  motion for\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nreconsideration.  No memorandum in support of the motion was\n\nfiled,  in violation of Local  Rule 19 of  the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District  of Maine.  Instead, Benefit\n\nsubmitted  an amended  Rule 19  Statement of  Material Facts\n\nsigned by  counsel for Benefit for  submission in opposition\n\nto  the  pending summary  judgment  motion  by Allstate  and\n\nNorthbrook.   After a  hearing, the Magistrate  Judge denied\n\nthe motion to reconsider.   No transcript of the  hearing is\n\navailable in the record.\n\n               On  July 10,  1991, the  first day  of trial,\n\nBenefit filed a \"Motion for Reconsideration By the Presiding\n\nJudge of a \n\nDecision  of the Magistrate Judge Entered July 2, 1991.\"  No\n\nsupporting  memorandum  was  filed.    The  District   Judge\n\ninformed  Benefit that he would not  rule immediately on the\n\nmotion,  that he would not reverse the Magistrate Judge on a\n\n\"judgment call\" on a discovery issue, but that \"[i]f, on the\n\nother hand,  there's a  matter of  law  here involved,  some\n\nlegal issue  that you  can indicate was  erroneously decided\n\nand you are clearly right, well then, I would maybe hear you\n\nat 4 o'clock  next Friday afternoon or  something.\"  Benefit\n\nhas  presented no  evidence that it  raised the  issue again\n\nwith the  District Court  or pressed  for a  ruling thereon.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nAccordingly, we rule that  Benefit has waived this  issue by\n\nits failure to develop the record in the District Court.\n\n               Pursuant to 28  U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A) (1991),\n\n\"[a] judge may designate a magistrate to hear and  determine\n\nany  pretrial  matter   pending  before   the  court   [with\n\nexceptions not relevant  here] . . . . A  judge of the court\n\nmay reconsider  any pretrial matter  under this subparagraph\n\n(A) where it has  been shown that the magistrate's  order is\n\nclearly  erroneous or contrary to law.\"  See also Park Motor\n                                                            \n\nMart, Inc.  v.

Consideration of discovery matters  by a magistrate\n\njudge comes within the purview  of the above subsection (A).\n\nSee Detection Systems, Inc. v.

Interpreting\n                        \n\n                    \n\n5 Subsection (b)(1)(B) of 28 U.S.C.   636 permits a district\njudge to  designate a  magistrate judge to  conduct hearings\nand to submit proposed  findings of fact and recommendations\nregarding dispositive motions and other matters specifically\nexcepted from subsection (b)(1)(A).   A district judge shall\n                                                            \nmake a de novo review  of these findings if a  party objects\n                                           \nwithin the required time period.  It is undisputed, however,\nthat subsection (b)(1)(A) applies  to the instant  discovery\nmatter.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nthis subsection, the First  Circuit has stated that \"[u]nder\n\nsubsection (b)(1)(A) certain pretrial matters may be decided\n\nwithout  further reference  to the  district judge,  but the\n\njudge 'may reconsider . . . where it has been shown that the\n\nmagistrate's  order  is  clearly  erroneous or  contrary  to\n\nlaw.'\"  ParkMotor Mart,616 F.2d at604 (omission inoriginal).\n                      \n\n               In the  instant case, the  District Judge was\n\nunder no obligation to review the decision of the Magistrate\n\nJudge.     The  District  Judge  here   offered  Benefit  an\n\nopportunity to  present something concrete showing  that the\n\ndecision was clearly erroneous but the opportunity was never\n\nexercised by  Benefit.   Other than  concerns as  to subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, we are  reluctant to consider on appeal\n\na  matter  upon  which  the  District  Judge  was  given  no\n\nopportunity  to rule.

Upon\n                              \n\nthis record, we conclude Benefit waived its challenge to the\n\nruling of the Magistrate Judge.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n          2.   Exclusion  of  the  Group   Agency  Agreement\n                                                            \n\nClaims\n      \n\n               Benefit filed its complaint on June 19, 1990.\n\nOn the day  prior to the expiration  of its right to  amend,\n\nBenefit moved to amend its  complaint and the District Court\n\nduly  allowed this  motion.   When  Northbrook and  Allstate\n\nchallenged  the amended  complaint by  a motion  for summary\n\njudgment, the briefing revealed a dispute concerning whether\n\nBenefit had claimed, in  its amended complaint, a breach  of\n\nthe Amended  General Agency  Agreement.  The  District Court\n\nruled that no such claim  had been set forth in  the Amended\n\nComplaint.  \n\n               Benefit argues that mention of \"contracts\" in\n\nCounts I and II  of the Amended Complaint are  references to\n\nthe  Amended General Agency Agreement as well as to the 1988\n\nService Agreements.  Benefit  also argues that references to\n\n\"agreements\"  throughout the  Amended Complaint  are to  the\n\nAmended  General  Agency  Agreement  and  the  1988  Service\n\nAgreements.  Lastly, Benefit urges that it pursued its claim\n\nfor  breach of  the Amended  General  Agency Agreement  in a\n\nnumber  of  significant  pleadings  and  that  Allstate  and\n\nNorthbrook  were  fully prepared  and  would  not have  been\n\nprejudiced by the trial of these claims.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n               These  arguments are unpersuasive.  A reading\n\nof   the  Amended   Complaint  as   a  whole   supports  the\n\ndetermination  of  the  District   Court  that  the  Amended\n\nComplaint does not state  a claim for breach of  the Amended\n\nGeneral Agency Agreement.  In its recitation of the facts in\n\nthe Amended Complaint, Benefit makes a perfunctory reference\n\nto Northbrook's  exercise of the  Withdrawal and  Suspension\n\nclause of the Amended  General Agency Agreement by alleging,\n\n\"Northbrook  exercised  its   termination  power  under  the\n\nAgreement.\"  This allegation does not challenge Northbrook's\n\nactions in  any way.  Moreover,  a fair reading  of the word\n\n\"contracts\"  in  Counts  I  and  II  is  most  reasonably  a\n\nreference to the 1988  Service Agreements.  In fact,  as the\n\nDistrict  Court  observed,  Count  I  (alleging  breach   of\n\ncontract against  Allstate) could  not refer to  the Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreement since Allstate  was not a party to\n\nthat  agreement and  had  no  contractual relationship  with\n\nBenefit prior to the 1988 Allstate Service Agreement.\n\n               Finally,  Benefit's  argument  that   it  has\n\npursued its claim  for breach of the Amended  General Agency\n\nAgreement  throughout the  pleadings  and that  Allstate and\n\nNorthbrook should therefore have been on notice and prepared\n\nto respond to these claims at trial is \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nwithout  merit.   This  is tantamount  to  a claim  that the\n\nDistrict  Court ought have allowed a further motion to amend\n\nthe complaint -- a motion Benefit never made.  Rule 15(a) of\n\nthe Federal  Rules of  Civil Procedure permits  amendment to\n\nthe  pleadings \"by leave of  court or by  written consent of\n\nthe adverse party.\"  Rule 15(b) provides that  pleadings may\n\nbe  amended  to conform  to  the evidence  where  issues not\n\nraised  by the pleadings are tried by the express or implied\n\nconsent  of  the parties.    Here,  Northbrook and  Allstate\n\noppose any such amendment  and the District Court  was never\n\nasked to approve a  further amendment.  Even if  the actions\n\nof the District Court could be  interpreted as a denial of a\n\nmotion by  Benefit to  further amend the  Amended Complaint,\n\nsuch a denial was well within the discretion of the district\n\njudge.  See  Riofrio Anda  v. Ralston Purina  Co., 959  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1149, 1154-55  (1st Cir.  1992) (affirming district  court's\n\ndenial of motion to amend after deadline  for amendments has\n\npassed as consistent with purpose of Rule 15[b]).  Here, the\n\noriginal Complaint was filed on June 19, 1990.  The District\n\nCourt ordered that  all amendments to the pleadings  be made\n\nby November 30, 1990.  Since Benefit did not  even raise the\n\nissue before  the summary judgment hearing on  or about June\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n24,  1991, there was no  abuse of discretion  in denying any\n\nfurther motion to amend.\n\n          3.   Fraud\n                    \n\n               We  next  consider  whether Northbrook's  and\n\nAllstate's conduct was fraudulent.  As to this aspect of the\n\ncase, Benefit  relies especially upon the  testimony of Mark\n\nStadler,  former  general  manager of  Northbrook.   Stadler\n\nadministered  the  34  Northbrook General  Agencies  (NGA's)\n\nincluding Benefit,  and he  and  others at  Northbrook  used\n\nlanguage such as \"partners\" and \"partnerships\" as matter  of\n\ncourse in referring to  the NGA's.  In February,  1988, when\n\nNorthbrook  was  considering  withdrawal  from  the  Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreements, however, Stadler, in an internal\n\nmemo, opined that the  NGA's \"are sitting ducks!\"   Two days\n\nlater, in  another internal memo, he  sketched this approach\n\nto further contract negotiations:\n\n               -- Terminate Northbrook Contracts - reinstate\n\nunder\n                  Allstate\n\n               -- Remove Exclusivity Clause\n\n               --  Run  out Northbrook  Certificates  .  . .\n\nrollover to\n                  Allstate Paper . . .\n\n               -- Immediately begin writing Allstate . . .\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n               -- Limit term of agreement to one year\n\nBenefit also  presented evidence that in  March, 1988, prior\n\nto the issuance of the  notice of Withdrawal and Suspension,\n\nAllstate had  been advised  by  McKinsey &amp;  Co., a  business\n\nconsulting company,  that Allstate  would need to  invest at\n\nleast $100,000,000 into its  group life and health insurance\n\nbusiness in order to be competitive.\n\n               Then, four days before Northbrook  issued its\n\nformal withdrawal  and suspension  notice, Stadler wrote  to\n\nhis superior, noting  that \"all  of the NGA's  feel that  we\n\nhave Breached [sic]  our agreement  not to act  in a  matter\n\ndetrimental to them\" and suggesting:\n\n       I  believe  we need  to  ask  ourselves if  the\n       tables were turned would  we sign the [proposed\n       1988 Service] agreements as they  are currently\n       worded.   I doubt it.  The NGA's have been good\n       partners.  We should not turn our backs on them\n       now.\n\n               During  the  same period,  as  the  negotiations\n\nleading to the execution of the 1988 Service Agreements spun out,\n\nAllstate and  Northbrook agents continued to  claim that Allstate\n\n\"will  be a player in the health insurance business,\" despite the\n\nfact that other Allstate representatives were, even then, meeting\n\nwith Goldman  Sachs  investment bankers  to discuss  the sale  of\n\nAllstate's group life and health business.\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n               From   this  evidence  and  other  corroborating\n\ncircumstances, Benefit  argues strenuously that it can reasonably\n\nbe inferred that Northbrook and Allstate -- in league together --\n\nconcocted the notice of withdrawal and suspension of the  Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreement  primarily to  get out  from under  its\n\nterms.  Then,  well knowing  that they were  ultimately going  to\n\ndump Benefit just as soon as it suited them, they  offered in its\n\nplace the 1988 Service Agreements.\n\n               There is no dispute  as to the  fraud claim  but\n\nthat the law of Maine applies.  In Maine,\n\n       [a] defendant is liable for fraud or deceit  if\n       he (1) makes  a false representation  (2) of  a\n       material fact (3) with knowledge of its falsity\n       or in reckless disregard of whether it is  true\n       or  false  (4)  for  the  purpose  of  inducing\n       another  to act  or to  refrain from  acting in\n       reliance  upon   it,  and  (5)   the  plaintiff\n       justifiably relies upon  the representation  as\n       true and acts upon it to his damage.\n\nJourdain  v. Dineen,  527  A.2d 1304,  1307  (Me. 1987)  (quoting\n                \n\nLetellier v. Small, 400 A.2d 371,  376 [Me. 1979]).  Moreover, to\n               \n\nsustain its burden  on the  claim of fraud,  Benefit \"must  prove\n\nevery element of [its] claim by clear and convincing evidence; in\n\nother words,  evidence that establishes every  factual element to\n\nbe highly probable.\"  Wildes v. Ocean National Bank of Kennebunk,\n                                                             \n\n498 A.2d 601, 602 (Me. 1985).\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\n               Benefit  asserts  that  in   order  to  properly\n\nexercise its rights under the Withdrawal and Suspension clause of\n\nthe Amended  General Agency  Agreement,6 Northbrook had  not only\n\nto cease marketing  group life and  health insurance through  the\n\nNGA  distribution  system,  but  also  through  all  distribution\n\nsystems in  Benefit's territory  as well, including  Equinet, the\n\nEquitable distribution system.  Benefit argues that the Notice of\n\nWithdrawal and Suspension and accompanying letter dated March 18,\n\n1988  represented  that  \"Northbrook was  ceasing  and suspending\n\nmarketing group  life and health insurance  policies in Benefit's\n\nterritory,\"  which  notice,  Benefit   says,  was  false  because\n\nNorthbrook maintained an ongoing  contract with Equitable to sell\n\nthe same products  in Benefit's  territory.7  In  support of  its\n\n                    \n\n6  The  Withdrawal  and  Suspension clause  of  the  Amended\nGeneral Agency Agreement states:\n       The  Company [Northbrook]  may withdraw  all or\n       any part of the authority granted to the  Group\n       Agency  [Benefit] in  Sections 1 and  2 hereof,\n       with respect to any line or lines of  insurance\n       which the Company has decided to cease or  sus-\n       pend writing  in any or all  of the location(s)\n       in which  the Group Agency has  been authorized\n       hereunder.  The Company will give not less than\n       one hundred eighty (180) days advance notice to\n       the Group  Agency prior  to  such cessation  or\n       suspension.\n\nApp. I at 105.\n\n7 Prior to trial in the District Court, Benefit's counsel at\nvarious times had pointed to  other oral statements as being\nallegedly false.  These  other promissory estoppel and fraud\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nargument,  Benefit has  provided  us with  numerous citations  to\n\ndocuments and  testimony by  Allstate and Northbrook  officers to\n\nshow  that the  Withdrawal  and Suspension  was  not intended  to\n\naffect the Equinet distribution system.\n\n               Where,  as  here, the  District Court  has ruled\n\nthat  the  evidence  is  insufficient  to  sustain  a  particular\n\nproposition, our standard of review is well settled:\n\n       [W]e  must find  that, viewing the  evidence in\n       the  light most  favorable  to  the  non-moving\n       party, reasonable  jurors could come to but one\n       conclusion.    We  must  give  [Benefit]  every\n       benefit   of    every   legitimate   inference.\n       However,  such  inferences   may  not  rest  on\n       conjecture  or  speculation,  but   rather  the\n       evidence  offered must  make 'the  existence of\n       the fact to be  inferred more probable than its\n       nonexistence.'\n\nDiPalma v.  Westinghouse Electric Corp., 938 F.2d 1463, 1464 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1991) (quoting Goldstein  v.

While it is true, as Benefit\n\nclaims,  that the Notice of  Withdrawal and Suspension states not\n\nonly  that   Northbrook  is  planning  to   discontinue  its  NGA\n\ndistribution system, of which Benefit was  a part, but goes on to\n\nrepresent  that Northbrook  is  withdrawing  from \"the  small-to-\n\nmedium  size employer group  life and health  insurance market in\n\ncertain market  territories,\" App. I at  227, this representation\n\nwas  not  false.   After an  exhaustive  trek through  the entire\n\nrecord, we find no indication that Benefit presented any evidence\n\nfrom  which it  could  be inferred  that  Northbrook or  Allstate\n\ncontinued to sell  group policy insurance in Benefit's area after\n\nMarch,  1988, when  Northbrook  represented that  it would  stop.\n\nMuch of the evidence presented by Benefit implies that Northbrook\n\nintended  to  continue selling  products through  Equitable after\n\nthat  date, but Benefit has  not shown that  Northbrook ever made\n\nany such  sales.  Since  no jury could reasonably  find that this\n\nrepresentation was false, an essential element of the fraud claim\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nis  absent.   The  District  Court thus  appropriately  granted a\n\ndirected verdict.8\n\n          4.   Breach of Contract9\n          4.   Breach of Contract\n                                 \n\n               Benefit   argues   that  the   District   Court,\n\nmisinterpreting and misapplying Illinois law, improperly directed\n\na verdict for Allstate and Northbrook on its claims for breach of\n\nthe two  1988 Service Agreements  and breach of the  duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.\n\n               Since we  here review a  diversity case  brought\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Maine, we\n\nmust determine the applicable law as  would a court of the  state\n\nof Maine.   Klaxon v. Stentor  Electric Mfg.  Co., 313 U.S.  487,\n                                              \n\n                    \n\n8 In  his opinion, the  District Judge stated  that Allstate\nand Northbrook could not have marketed group life and health\ninsurance  in Maine after January 1,  1988, because they had\nsold  this portion of the business to Metropolitan.  Even if\nthere were evidence  to the contrary, as Benefit says, i.e.,\nthat the  Equitable business was exempted  from the transfer\nto Metropolitan, Benefit still has shown no  actual sales by\nEquitable, only the potential  for sales.  Any error  by the\ntrial judge regarding this matter is therefore harmless.\n\n9  Benefit also argues on this point that the District Court\nimproperly characterized the  testimony of Benefit's damages\nexpert as contrary to the evidence.   We need not reach this\nissue since it was not a ground  on which the District Court\nbased  its directed  verdict,  viz., \"[The  weakness of  the\nexpert  testimony]  is  not  an independent  ground  of  the\nCourt's   granting  the   motion   for   directed   verdict,\nnevertheless  it's a factor.  It's sort of a background con-\nsideration  which the Court has not felt it should ignore. .\n. .\"\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n496-97 (1941).   Each of  the 1988  Service Agreements  contained\n\nchoice of law  provisions stating that Illinois law  would govern\n\neach  contract.     Since   a  Maine  court,   under  established\n\nprinciples, would  honor contractual choice of law  and apply the\n\nlaw of the state of Illinois in  this case, we shall do the same,\n\nas did the trial  court.  Lincoln Pulp &amp; Paper Co., Inc. v. Dravo\n                                                              \n\nCorp.,  436 F. Supp. 262, 268 (D. Me. 1977).\n  \n\n               Benefit's  Amended Complaint  asserted  separate\n\nclaims for breach of contract (Counts I and II) and breach of the\n\nduty  of good  faith and  fair dealing  (Counts V  and VI).   The\n\nDistrict  Court consolidated  the breach  of fair  dealing counts\n\nwith  the breach of contract counts, ruling that Illinois did not\n\nrecognize an independent cause  of action for breach of  the duty\n\nof good faith.\n\n               The District Court then  directed a verdict  for\n\nNorthbrook and  Allstate  on  the contract  claims.    The  court\n\nreasoned  (1) that  where independent  business people  knowingly\n\nenter into  a contract,  they must  bear  responsibility for  its\n\nterms,  (2) that  the Northbrook  Service Agreement  provided for\n\ntermination  upon  90  days   notice  and  the  Allstate  Service\n\nAgreement likewise  provided for termination, albeit  on 180 days\n\nnotice,  (3) that the requisite  notices had been  given, and (4)\n\nthat,  even in the context of a franchise agreement, the covenant\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nof  good  faith  and  fair  dealing does  not  supervene  express\n\ncontractual terms.   Benefit here challenges the decision  of the\n\nDistrict Court to fold the issue  of good faith and fair  dealing\n\ninto the  two contract counts (thus dismissing  those counts that\n\nasserted  that issue as an  independent cause of  action) and its\n\nultimate  legal  conclusion  that,  notwithstanding  the  implied\n\ncovenant of good  faith, the  express terms of  the 1988  Service\n\nAgreements governed and were fulfilled.\n\n               Benefit relies on  P&amp;W Supply Co., Inc. v.

In\n\nIllinois, the term \"good faith\" refers to \"an implied undertaking\n\nnot to take opportunistic  advantage in a way that could not have\n\nbeen contemplated at  the time of  drafting, and which  therefore\n\nwas not resolved explicitly by the parties.\"  Kham &amp; Nate's Shoes\n                                                              \n\nNo. 2,  Inc. v.

This evidence,  coupled with\n\nthe  fact that Northbrook and  Allstate treated all  the NGA's as\n\nshabbily  as  they  had  Benefit  conclusively  demonstrates  the\n\nabsence of malice toward Benefit.

The \"good hands\" people are here\n\nrevealed as  much less  than the  cooperative partners they  held\n\nthemselves out  to  be.   Instead, this  record makes  abundantly\n\nclear that  both Allstate and Northbrook  single-mindedly pursued\n\ntheir economic advantage with  little regard for the consequences\n\nto Benefit and the other NGA's and maneuvered in such a way as to\n\nsqueeze the  last bit of service  out of their soon  to be dumped\n\n\"partners.\"\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\n               Their  conduct, however,  driven  as  it was  by\n\neconomic necessity, does not rise to the level of bad faith under\n\nthe law of Illinois.

Since\n\nthis   Northbrook-Equitable  agreement   arguably  infringed\n\nBenefit's exclusive agency,  Northbrook offered, and Benefit\n\naccepted, an Amended Group Agency Agreement which  permitted\n\nthe  sales by the Equitable Agents in return for a reduction\n\nin  Benefit's franchise  fee  as well  as added  contractual\n\nprotections for Benefit.\n\n               On  March  18,  1988,   Northbrook,  claiming\n\nsevere  business losses,  sent  Benefit a  formal notice  of\n\nwithdrawal  and suspension pursuant  to the  Amended General\n\nAgency  Agreement.2   At the  same time,  Northbrook offered\n\nBenefit a limited Service Agreement (\"the Northbrook Service\n\nAgreement\")  which allowed Benefit certain renewal marketing\n\nand  extended  claims  paying authority  on  the  Northbrook\n\npolicies then in force which were being serviced by Benefit.\n\n                    \n2 This notice stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Current   business  conditions   have  caused\n       Northbrook  to  revaluate  its  Group  Agency\n       operations, resulting in our  withdrawal from\n       the small-to-medium sized employer group life\n       and health insurance market in certain market\n       territories.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nLikewise, Allstate offered Benefit a service agreement (\"the\n\nAllstate Service Agreement\") which granted Benefit marketing\n\nand  claims  administration  authority  for  certain  future\n\ninsurance business under the Allstate name.\n\n               Benefit was reluctant to enter into these two\n\nservice   agreements   (collectively   the   \"1988   Service\n\nAgreements\") since the  offer was extended  for but a  short\n\ntime and  then on a 'take  it or leave it  basis,' and since\n\nthe termination  provisions were  less favorable to  Benefit\n\nthan those found in  the  Amended General  Agency Agreement.\n\nThe   alternative,   however,   was   no   further  business\n\nrelationship at all  with a most lucrative  account.3  Since\n\nAllstate  was  dangling  the   prospect  of  a  longer  term\n\nrelationship,4 Benefit signed.\n\n                    \n3 During 1988, Benefit derived more than 65% of its revenues\nfrom its Northbrook  business --  a sum  of over  $2,000,000\nfrom  which Benefit  received  commissions of  approximately\n$665,000.\n\n4 Allstate's agents communicated with Benefit as follows:\n\n       The term of the new Allstate contract is one year.\n       We anticipate that during this year  major changes\n       will   evolve  in   our  strategy   of  healthcare\n       delivery.  . .  .   This  provision  has not  been\n       included with  the idea  of terminating  without a\n       continuation option.

Certain of its\n\nclaims   succumbed  to   summary  judgment;   the  remainder\n\ncollapsed  when  the District  Court  allowed  a motion  for\n\ndirected  verdict  in  favor  of  Northbrook  and  Allstate.\n\nBenefit's appeal raises four issues.\n\n          1.  Denial  by the Magistrate  Judge of  Benefit's\n                                                            \n\nMotion\n      \n\n              to Compel\n                       \n\n               On April 23, 1991, in the course of preparing\n\nfor  trial, Benefit  moved to  compel discovery  of fourteen\n\ndocuments  which Allstate  and Northbrook had  withheld from\n\nproduction on the  grounds that they  were protected by  the\n\nattorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine.  In\n\nsupport  of its  motion, Benefit  argued that  the documents\n\nwere subject to the crime-fraud exception to the privilege.\n\n               After a  hearing and  an in camera  review of\n                                                 \n\nthe documents, the Magistrate Judge denied the motion due to\n\nBenefit's failure to make  the requisite prima facie showing\n                                                    \n\nof fraud.   On  June 10,  1991, Benefit  filed a  motion for\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nreconsideration.  No memorandum in support of the motion was\n\nfiled,  in violation of Local  Rule 19 of  the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District  of Maine.  Instead, Benefit\n\nsubmitted  an amended  Rule 19  Statement of  Material Facts\n\nsigned by  counsel for Benefit for  submission in opposition\n\nto  the  pending summary  judgment  motion  by Allstate  and\n\nNorthbrook.   After a  hearing, the Magistrate  Judge denied\n\nthe motion to reconsider.   No transcript of the  hearing is\n\navailable in the record.\n\n               On  July 10,  1991, the  first day  of trial,\n\nBenefit filed a \"Motion for Reconsideration By the Presiding\n\nJudge of a \n\nDecision  of the Magistrate Judge Entered July 2, 1991.\"  No\n\nsupporting  memorandum  was  filed.    The  District   Judge\n\ninformed  Benefit that he would not  rule immediately on the\n\nmotion,  that he would not reverse the Magistrate Judge on a\n\n\"judgment call\" on a discovery issue, but that \"[i]f, on the\n\nother hand,  there's a  matter of  law  here involved,  some\n\nlegal issue  that you  can indicate was  erroneously decided\n\nand you are clearly right, well then, I would maybe hear you\n\nat 4 o'clock  next Friday afternoon or  something.\"  Benefit\n\nhas  presented no  evidence that it  raised the  issue again\n\nwith the  District Court  or pressed  for a  ruling thereon.\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nAccordingly, we rule that  Benefit has waived this  issue by\n\nits failure to develop the record in the District Court.\n\n               Pursuant to 28  U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A) (1991),\n\n\"[a] judge may designate a magistrate to hear and  determine\n\nany  pretrial  matter   pending  before   the  court   [with\n\nexceptions not relevant  here] . . . .

Upon\n                              \n\nthis record, we conclude Benefit waived its challenge to the\n\nruling of the Magistrate Judge.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n          2.   Exclusion  of  the  Group   Agency  Agreement\n                                                            \n\nClaims\n      \n\n               Benefit filed its complaint on June 19, 1990.\n\nOn the day  prior to the expiration  of its right to  amend,\n\nBenefit moved to amend its  complaint and the District Court\n\nduly  allowed this  motion.   When  Northbrook and  Allstate\n\nchallenged  the amended  complaint by  a motion  for summary\n\njudgment, the briefing revealed a dispute concerning whether\n\nBenefit had claimed, in  its amended complaint, a breach  of\n\nthe Amended  General Agency  Agreement.  The  District Court\n\nruled that no such claim  had been set forth in  the Amended\n\nComplaint.  \n\n               Benefit argues that mention of \"contracts\" in\n\nCounts I and II  of the Amended Complaint are  references to\n\nthe  Amended General Agency Agreement as well as to the 1988\n\nService Agreements.  Benefit  also argues that references to\n\n\"agreements\"  throughout the  Amended Complaint  are to  the\n\nAmended  General  Agency  Agreement  and  the  1988  Service\n\nAgreements.  Lastly, Benefit urges that it pursued its claim\n\nfor  breach of  the Amended  General  Agency Agreement  in a\n\nnumber  of  significant  pleadings  and  that  Allstate  and\n\nNorthbrook  were  fully prepared  and  would  not have  been\n\nprejudiced by the trial of these claims.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n               These  arguments are unpersuasive.  A reading\n\nof   the  Amended   Complaint  as   a  whole   supports  the\n\ndetermination  of  the  District   Court  that  the  Amended\n\nComplaint does not state  a claim for breach of  the Amended\n\nGeneral Agency Agreement.  In its recitation of the facts in\n\nthe Amended Complaint, Benefit makes a perfunctory reference\n\nto Northbrook's  exercise of the  Withdrawal and  Suspension\n\nclause of the Amended  General Agency Agreement by alleging,\n\n\"Northbrook  exercised  its   termination  power  under  the\n\nAgreement.\"  This allegation does not challenge Northbrook's\n\nactions in  any way.  Moreover,  a fair reading  of the word\n\n\"contracts\"  in  Counts  I  and  II  is  most  reasonably  a\n\nreference to the 1988  Service Agreements.  In fact,  as the\n\nDistrict  Court  observed,  Count  I  (alleging  breach   of\n\ncontract against  Allstate) could  not refer to  the Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreement since Allstate  was not a party to\n\nthat  agreement and  had  no  contractual relationship  with\n\nBenefit prior to the 1988 Allstate Service Agreement.\n\n               Finally,  Benefit's  argument  that   it  has\n\npursued its claim  for breach of the Amended  General Agency\n\nAgreement  throughout the  pleadings  and that  Allstate and\n\nNorthbrook should therefore have been on notice and prepared\n\nto respond to these claims at trial is \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nwithout  merit.   This  is tantamount  to  a claim  that the\n\nDistrict  Court ought have allowed a further motion to amend\n\nthe complaint -- a motion Benefit never made.  Rule 15(a) of\n\nthe Federal  Rules of  Civil Procedure permits  amendment to\n\nthe  pleadings \"by leave of  court or by  written consent of\n\nthe adverse party.\"  Rule 15(b) provides that  pleadings may\n\nbe  amended  to conform  to  the evidence  where  issues not\n\nraised  by the pleadings are tried by the express or implied\n\nconsent  of  the parties.    Here,  Northbrook and  Allstate\n\noppose any such amendment  and the District Court  was never\n\nasked to approve a  further amendment.  Even if  the actions\n\nof the District Court could be  interpreted as a denial of a\n\nmotion by  Benefit to  further amend the  Amended Complaint,\n\nsuch a denial was well within the discretion of the district\n\njudge.

Here, the\n\noriginal Complaint was filed on June 19, 1990.  The District\n\nCourt ordered that  all amendments to the pleadings  be made\n\nby November 30, 1990.  Since Benefit did not  even raise the\n\nissue before  the summary judgment hearing on  or about June\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n24,  1991, there was no  abuse of discretion  in denying any\n\nfurther motion to amend.\n\n          3.   Fraud\n                    \n\n               We  next  consider  whether Northbrook's  and\n\nAllstate's conduct was fraudulent.  As to this aspect of the\n\ncase, Benefit  relies especially upon the  testimony of Mark\n\nStadler,  former  general  manager of  Northbrook.   Stadler\n\nadministered  the  34  Northbrook General  Agencies  (NGA's)\n\nincluding Benefit,  and he  and  others at  Northbrook  used\n\nlanguage such as \"partners\" and \"partnerships\" as matter  of\n\ncourse in referring to  the NGA's.  In February,  1988, when\n\nNorthbrook  was  considering  withdrawal  from  the  Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreements, however, Stadler, in an internal\n\nmemo, opined that the  NGA's \"are sitting ducks!\"   Two days\n\nlater, in  another internal memo, he  sketched this approach\n\nto further contract negotiations:\n\n               -- Terminate Northbrook Contracts - reinstate\n\nunder\n                  Allstate\n\n               -- Remove Exclusivity Clause\n\n               --  Run  out Northbrook  Certificates  .  . .\n\nrollover to\n                  Allstate Paper . . .\n\n               -- Immediately begin writing Allstate . . .\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n               -- Limit term of agreement to one year\n\nBenefit also  presented evidence that in  March, 1988, prior\n\nto the issuance of the  notice of Withdrawal and Suspension,\n\nAllstate had  been advised  by  McKinsey &amp;  Co., a  business\n\nconsulting company,  that Allstate  would need to  invest at\n\nleast $100,000,000 into its  group life and health insurance\n\nbusiness in order to be competitive.\n\n               Then, four days before Northbrook  issued its\n\nformal withdrawal  and suspension  notice, Stadler wrote  to\n\nhis superior, noting  that \"all  of the NGA's  feel that  we\n\nhave Breached [sic]  our agreement  not to act  in a  matter\n\ndetrimental to them\" and suggesting:\n\n       I  believe  we need  to  ask  ourselves if  the\n       tables were turned would  we sign the [proposed\n       1988 Service] agreements as they  are currently\n       worded.   I doubt it.  The NGA's have been good\n       partners.  We should not turn our backs on them\n       now.\n\n               During  the  same period,  as  the  negotiations\n\nleading to the execution of the 1988 Service Agreements spun out,\n\nAllstate and  Northbrook agents continued to  claim that Allstate\n\n\"will  be a player in the health insurance business,\" despite the\n\nfact that other Allstate representatives were, even then, meeting\n\nwith Goldman  Sachs  investment bankers  to discuss  the sale  of\n\nAllstate's group life and health business.\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n               From   this  evidence  and  other  corroborating\n\ncircumstances, Benefit  argues strenuously that it can reasonably\n\nbe inferred that Northbrook and Allstate -- in league together --\n\nconcocted the notice of withdrawal and suspension of the  Amended\n\nGeneral  Agency Agreement  primarily to  get out  from under  its\n\nterms.  Then,  well knowing  that they were  ultimately going  to\n\ndump Benefit just as soon as it suited them, they  offered in its\n\nplace the 1988 Service Agreements.\n\n               There is no dispute  as to the  fraud claim  but\n\nthat the law of Maine applies.  In Maine,\n\n       [a] defendant is liable for fraud or deceit  if\n       he (1) makes  a false representation  (2) of  a\n       material fact (3) with knowledge of its falsity\n       or in reckless disregard of whether it is  true\n       or  false  (4)  for  the  purpose  of  inducing\n       another  to act  or to  refrain from  acting in\n       reliance  upon   it,  and  (5)   the  plaintiff\n       justifiably relies upon  the representation  as\n       true and acts upon it to his damage.\n\nJourdain  v.

While it is true, as Benefit\n\nclaims,  that the Notice of  Withdrawal and Suspension states not\n\nonly  that   Northbrook  is  planning  to   discontinue  its  NGA\n\ndistribution system, of which Benefit was  a part, but goes on to\n\nrepresent  that Northbrook  is  withdrawing  from \"the  small-to-\n\nmedium  size employer group  life and health  insurance market in\n\ncertain market  territories,\" App. I at  227, this representation\n\nwas  not  false.   After an  exhaustive  trek through  the entire\n\nrecord, we find no indication that Benefit presented any evidence\n\nfrom  which it  could  be inferred  that  Northbrook or  Allstate\n\ncontinued to sell  group policy insurance in Benefit's area after\n\nMarch,  1988, when  Northbrook  represented that  it would  stop.\n\nMuch of the evidence presented by Benefit implies that Northbrook\n\nintended  to  continue selling  products through  Equitable after\n\nthat  date, but Benefit has  not shown that  Northbrook ever made\n\nany such  sales.

Even if\nthere were evidence  to the contrary, as Benefit says, i.e.,\nthat the  Equitable business was exempted  from the transfer\nto Metropolitan, Benefit still has shown no  actual sales by\nEquitable, only the potential  for sales.  Any error  by the\ntrial judge regarding this matter is therefore harmless.\n\n9  Benefit also argues on this point that the District Court\nimproperly characterized the  testimony of Benefit's damages\nexpert as contrary to the evidence.   We need not reach this\nissue since it was not a ground  on which the District Court\nbased  its directed  verdict,  viz., \"[The  weakness of  the\nexpert  testimony]  is  not  an independent  ground  of  the\nCourt's   granting  the   motion   for   directed   verdict,\nnevertheless  it's a factor.

The\n\nDistrict  Court consolidated  the breach  of fair  dealing counts\n\nwith  the breach of contract counts, ruling that Illinois did not\n\nrecognize an independent cause  of action for breach of  the duty\n\nof good faith.\n\n               The District Court then  directed a verdict  for\n\nNorthbrook and  Allstate  on  the contract  claims.    The  court\n\nreasoned  (1) that  where independent  business people  knowingly\n\nenter into  a contract,  they must  bear  responsibility for  its\n\nterms,  (2) that  the Northbrook  Service Agreement  provided for\n\ntermination  upon  90  days   notice  and  the  Allstate  Service\n\nAgreement likewise  provided for termination, albeit  on 180 days\n\nnotice,  (3) that the requisite  notices had been  given, and (4)\n\nthat,  even in the context of a franchise agreement, the covenant\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nof  good  faith  and  fair  dealing does  not  supervene  express\n\ncontractual terms.   Benefit here challenges the decision  of the\n\nDistrict Court to fold the issue  of good faith and fair  dealing\n\ninto the  two contract counts (thus dismissing  those counts that\n\nasserted  that issue as an  independent cause of  action) and its\n\nultimate  legal  conclusion  that,  notwithstanding  the  implied\n\ncovenant of good  faith, the  express terms of  the 1988  Service\n\nAgreements governed and were fulfilled.\n\n               Benefit relies on  P&amp;W Supply Co., Inc. v.

This evidence,  coupled with\n\nthe  fact that Northbrook and  Allstate treated all  the NGA's as\n\nshabbily  as  they  had  Benefit  conclusively  demonstrates  the\n\nabsence of malice toward Benefit.

The \"good hands\" people are here\n\nrevealed as  much less  than the  cooperative partners they  held\n\nthemselves out  to  be.   Instead, this  record makes  abundantly\n\nclear that  both Allstate and Northbrook  single-mindedly pursued\n\ntheir economic advantage with  little regard for the consequences\n\nto Benefit and the other NGA's and maneuvered in such a way as to\n\nsqueeze the  last bit of service  out of their soon  to be dumped\n\n\"partners.\"\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\n               Their  conduct, however,  driven  as  it was  by\n\neconomic necessity, does not rise to the level of bad faith under\n\nthe law of Illinois.
