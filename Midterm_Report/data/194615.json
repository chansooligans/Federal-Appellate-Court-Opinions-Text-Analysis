Appellants  Ebenezer Aluko\n                                   \n\nand Henry Olawale Balogun pled  guilty to conspiracy, mail fraud,\n\nand insurance  fraud in violation  of 18  U.S.C.    371,  1341-42\n\n(1984)  and  42  U.S.C.    408(a)(7)(B)  (1991).    Specifically,\n\nappellants procured  insurance  coverage on  vehicles  registered\n\nunder fictitious  names.  The conspiracy entailed one hundred and\n\ntwenty-four fraudulent  claims amounting  to $620,000.1   Balogun\n\nand another co-defendant  initiated the scheme on April  1, 1989;\n\nAluko joined the conspiracy on or about October 6, 1990.\n\n          The  district  court  sentenced  Aluko  to  twenty-four\n\nmonths  in   prison2   and  Balogun   to  thirty-three   months.3\n\nAppellants appeal their sentences.\n\n          \"We review  a trial  court's  determinations under  the\n\n[United  States]  Sentencing  Guidelines only  for  clear error.\"\n\nUnited States  v. Panet-Collazo,  960 F.2d  256,  262 (1st  Cir.)\n                               \n\n(citing  United States v. Sklar,  920 F.2d 107,  110-11 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1990)),  cert.  denied,  113 S.  Ct.  645  (1992).   However,  we\n                      \n\ninterpret provisions of the relevant  guidelines de novo.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).  Because we\n                 \n\nfind  no clear  error  in the  district  court's calculation,  we\n\naffirm Balogun's  sentence.  However,  we find that  the district\n\n                    \n\n1  Although  the claims amounted to  $620,000, appellants' arrest\nprevented the collection of $403,000.\n\n2    The  judge also  imposed  a  three-year  term of  supervised\nrelease, restitution of $16,750, and a $50 special assessment.\n\n3  The judge  also imposed a three-year supervised  release term,\nrestitution  of $100,000 if the defendant was not deported, and a\n$200 special assessment.\n\n                               -3-\n\ncourt  improperly interpreted  a  guideline  relevant to  Aluko's\n\nsentence.    Thus, we  vacate that  sentence  and remand  for re-\n\nsentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n          We address the appeals in turn.\n\nAppellant Aluko\n               \n\n          At   his  sentencing   hearing,  Aluko   contested  his\n\npresentence  report's calculation  of  offense  level  under  the\n\nUnited   States   Sentencing   Guidelines   (\"U.S.S.G.\").4     In\n\ncalculating the  total offense  level in the  presentence report,\n\nthe probation officer  based his calculation  on all one  hundred\n\nand  twenty-four   fraudulent  claims   filed  as  part   of  the\n\nconspiracy.   As these claims  amounted to $620,000,  he enhanced\n\nAluko's base  offense level  by ten  levels pursuant to  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(1)(K) (Nov. 1991) (ten level offense increase required\n\nfor losses  between $500,000  and $800,000).    In addition,  the\n\nprobation  officer concluded  that Aluko's  participation in  the\n\nscheme involved  more than  minimal planning.   Thus, he  further\n\nenhanced Aluko's offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2) (Nov. 1991).5  Finally, the probation officer  also\n\nsubtracted  two levels  for  acceptance of  responsibility.   The\n\ndistrict court adopted the presentence report calculation.\n\n                    \n\n4  Both parties  agree that the 1991 sentencing  guidelines apply\nto this case.\n\n5  Section 2F1.1(b)(2) provides:\n\n            If the  offense involved . .  . more than\n            minimal  planning .  .  . increase  by  2\n            levels.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          At  sentencing, Aluko challenged the presentence report\n\non two  grounds, both of which he revives in this appeal.  First,\n\nAluko contends that the government established his involvement in\n\nonly ten of  the one hundred  and twenty-four fraudulent  claims,\n\nand that  he can only be  held responsible for those  ten claims.\n\nHe  asserts that  the  rest of  the  claims were  actions of  co-\n\nconspirators which were not  reasonably foreseeable to him.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1),  Application  Note 1  (Nov.  1991)  (for\n\nsentencing  purposes, defendant  is accountable  for \"conduct  of\n\nothers  in  furtherance of  the  execution  of jointly-undertaken\n\ncriminal   activity  that  was   reasonably  foreseeable  by  the\n                                                        \n\ndefendant\") (emphasis added).\n\n          In  its  sentencing ruling,  the  district court  never\n\ndiscussed whether Aluko's co-conspirators' additional one hundred\n\nand  fourteen fraudulent  claims were  reasonably foreseeable  to\n\nAluko.  The court simply concluded that Aluko\n\n            was a conspirator with two  other people.\n            He   was   an  important   part   of  the\n            conspiracy  regardless  of the  numerical\n            figures  involved in claims  filed, or in\n            amount of  money that he  received.   And\n            so,  he's  responsible   for  the   whole\n            conspiracy.  It's seldom that we find co-\n            conspirators who know  all facets of  the\n            operation.  They know they're involved in\n            a conspiracy and they're involved  at one\n            tier level or another and, therefore, are\n            integral parts and necessary parts of the\n            success of the whole conspiracy.\n\n            (sentencing hearing transcript at 14).\n\n          This language  suggests that once a  defendant plays an\n\nintegral  role in a  conspiracy, he is  liable for co-conspirator\n\n                               -5-\n\nacts  in  furtherance  of  the conspiracy,  regardless  of  their\n\nforeseeability.   While  this  language  correctly describes  the\n\nproper  standard for  a defendant's  criminal conviction  for co-\n                                                        \n\nconspirator acts, United States  v. Fusaro, 708 F.2d 17,  21 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1983),  it  does   not  correctly  describe  a  defendant's\n\nresponsibility  for   these  actions  for   sentencing  purposes.\n                                                                \n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1),  Application  Note 1;  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1025-26 n.11 (1st Cir. 1992).\n       \n\n          We  might  in some  circumstances  treat  a finding  of\n\nforeseeability as inherent in  the nature of the conspiracy.   In\n\nthis   case,  however,   it  appears   that  the   judge  thought\n\nforeseeability inherent  in all conspiracies.   This  is not  the\n                               \n\nlaw.\n\n          In addition, some of the co-conspirator acts presumably\n\noccurred before Aluko joined the conspiracy as he joined one year\n\nafter  it  began.   By definition,  acts  that occurred  before a\n\ndefendant enters  a conspiracy  cannot be foreseeable.   O'Campo,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at 1026.\n\n          Accordingly, we vacate Aluko's sentence and remand  for\n\na determination of which, if  any, of co-defendants' actions were\n\nreasonably  foreseeable  to  Aluko,6  and  for  re-sentencing  in\n\naccordance with that determination.\n\n          Second, Aluko argues that he played a  minimal or minor\n\nrole in the conspiracy,  and thus deserved a downward  adjustment\n\n                    \n\n6  We note that this determination should also address  the issue\nof  which co-conspirator conduct, if any, took place before Aluko\njoined the conspiracy.\n\n                               -6-\n\nto his total  offense level pursuant  to U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(a)  and\n\n(b)  (Nov. 1991).7    We  first  note  that  defendants  are  not\n\nautomatically entitled to  a downward adjustment, whatever  their\n\nrole  in the crime.   United States v.  Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n506,  514 (1st  Cir.  1991).   Indeed, the  record  in this  case\n\nadequately supports the district court's denial of the reduction.\n\nAluko indicated that his  involvement in the conspiracy  began on\n\nOctober 6, 1990.   He remained active in the  conspiracy until he\n\nwas  arrested one  year later.   He was  directly involved  in at\n\nleast  ten fraudulent  claims.   Ultimately, the  court concluded\n\nthat Aluko was an integral part of the conspiracy and granted him\n\nno reduction.  We find no clear error in this determination.\n\nAppellant Balogun\n                 \n\n          Before Balogun's sentencing, the government objected to\n\nhis  presentence report,  claiming that  his total  offense level\n\nshould  have  been  increased  two points  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.\n\n  3B1.1(c)  (Nov.  1991).8   Specifically, the  government argued\n\n                    \n\n7  Section 3B1.2(a) provides:\n\n            If   the   defendant   was    a   minimal\n            participant  in  any  criminal  activity,\n            decrease by 4 levels.\n\n   Section 3B1.2(b) provides:\n\n            If the defendant  was a minor participant\n            in  any criminal activity,  decrease by 2\n            levels. \n\n8  Section 3B1.1(c) provides:\n\n            If  the  defendant   was  an   organizer,\n            leader,  manager,  or  supervisor in  any\n            criminal activity other than described in\n\n                               -7-\n\nthat  Balogun was  an \"organizer, leader,  or supervisor\"  of the\n\nconspiracy  for the  purposes of  that section.   The  sentencing\n\njudge accepted the government's representations and increased the\n\ntotal offense level from sixteen to eighteen.\n\n          Balogun  offers  two  principal  arguments  against the\n\njudge's calculation of his  sentence.  First, he argues  that the\n\ndistrict   court   impermissibly  relied   on   the  prosecutor's\n\nstatements  in  reaching  its   conclusion.    Balogun  does  not\n\nchallenge  the  facts  at   issue;  however,  he  challenges  the\n\napplication of   3B1.1(c) to these facts.\n\n          Application Note 3 of U.S.S.G.   3B1.1 counsels that in\n\ndetermining  whether  a defendant  is  an  organizer, leader,  or\n\nsupervisor  pursuant  to   3B1.1(c),  the  court should  consider\n\nfactors   including:     (1)  decision   making   authority;  (2)\n\nparticipation in the offense; (3) recruitment of accomplices; (4)\n\nclaimed  right to a larger share of  the fruits of the crime; (5)\n\ndegree of planning or organizing; (6) nature of illegal activity;\n\nand (7) degree of control over others.\n\n          The  undisputed facts  in  the present  case show  that\n\nBalogun  initiated the conspiracy with another co-conspirator; he\n\nreceived significantly more money from the conspiracy than Aluko;\n\nhe used cars fraudulently registered to Aluko to stage accidents;\n\nand he paid  Aluko for his cooperation in the scheme.  We find no\n\nclear error in the  district court's conclusion that Balogun  fit\n\nthe role of an organizer, leader, or supervisor.\n\n                    \n\n            (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          Second,  Balogun  argues that  the  sentence adjustment\n\nresulted in impermissible double  counting because in addition to\n\nthe  increase for being an organizer,  supervisor, or leader, the\n\ndistrict court also accepted the presentence report's enhancement\n\nof Balogun's sentence for more than minimal  planning pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2).\n\n          In United States  v. Fuller, 897  F.2d 1217, 1222  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1990),  we reversed  an  enhancement  based on    3B1.1(c),\n\nnoting  our concern  that  such an  enhancement  would result  in\n\ndouble  counting.  The sentencing  court in that  case based both\n\nits   3B1.1(c)  and its    2F1.1(b)(2) enhancements on  one fact:\n\nthe quantity of marijuana involved.  See id.\n                                           \n\n          Balogun argues that the sentencing judge considered the\n\nelaborate  nature of the scheme  in applying the  increase for an\n\norganizer, leader, or supervisor  even though that complexity was\n\nalready  accounted   for  in  the  more   than  minimal  planning\n\nenhancement.   In support  of this contention,  Balogun notes the\n\nfollowing statements by the sentencing judge.\n\n            . . . I'm  satisfied that Mr. Balogun and\n            Mr. [Oyelele] were the organizers of this\n            scheme.  They were the people who thought\n            this matter up, maybe with help of others\n            unknown, and  Aluko was  just one of  the\n            people who was initiated into the scheme,\n            to  be part of some facets of it.  So I'm\n                                                     \n            satisfied that Balogun and [Oyelele] were\n                     \n            organizers and leaders and supervisors of\n            this matter. . . .\n\n            This  was a fairly  elaborate scheme, one\n            that required a lot of planning and a lot\n            of organization, and  a lot of fraudulent\n            documents.    And,  therefore,  I  think,\n            under   the   circumstances,  the   total\n\n                               -9-\n\n            offense level should be 20. . . .  \n\n            (sentencing transcript at 9) (emphasis added).\n\nAs we  see  it, this  language  shows that  the court  based  his\n\n  3B1.1(c)  enhancement decision on  Balogun's initiation  of the\n\nscheme and recruitment  of Aluko,  not on the  complexity of  the\n\nscheme.   The judge's allusion  to the scheme's  elaborate nature\n\nsimply  provided  further   superfluous  justification  for   the\n\nresulting   total  offense   level.

Because we\n                 \n\nfind  no clear  error  in the  district  court's calculation,  we\n\naffirm Balogun's  sentence.  However,  we find that  the district\n\n                    \n\n1  Although  the claims amounted to  $620,000, appellants' arrest\nprevented the collection of $403,000.\n\n2    The  judge also  imposed  a  three-year  term of  supervised\nrelease, restitution of $16,750, and a $50 special assessment.\n\n3  The judge  also imposed a three-year supervised  release term,\nrestitution  of $100,000 if the defendant was not deported, and a\n$200 special assessment.\n\n                               -3-\n\ncourt  improperly interpreted  a  guideline  relevant to  Aluko's\n\nsentence.    Thus, we  vacate that  sentence  and remand  for re-\n\nsentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n          We address the appeals in turn.\n\nAppellant Aluko\n               \n\n          At   his  sentencing   hearing,  Aluko   contested  his\n\npresentence  report's calculation  of  offense  level  under  the\n\nUnited   States   Sentencing   Guidelines   (\"U.S.S.G.\").4     In\n\ncalculating the  total offense  level in the  presentence report,\n\nthe probation officer  based his calculation  on all one  hundred\n\nand  twenty-four   fraudulent  claims   filed  as  part   of  the\n\nconspiracy.   As these claims  amounted to $620,000,  he enhanced\n\nAluko's base  offense level  by ten  levels pursuant to  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(1)(K) (Nov. 1991) (ten level offense increase required\n\nfor losses  between $500,000  and $800,000).    In addition,  the\n\nprobation  officer concluded  that Aluko's  participation in  the\n\nscheme involved  more than  minimal planning.   Thus, he  further\n\nenhanced Aluko's offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2) (Nov. 1991).5  Finally, the probation officer  also\n\nsubtracted  two levels  for  acceptance of  responsibility.   The\n\ndistrict court adopted the presentence report calculation.\n\n                    \n\n4  Both parties  agree that the 1991 sentencing  guidelines apply\nto this case.\n\n5  Section 2F1.1(b)(2) provides:\n\n            If the  offense involved . .  . more than\n            minimal  planning .  .  . increase  by  2\n            levels.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          At  sentencing, Aluko challenged the presentence report\n\non two  grounds, both of which he revives in this appeal.  First,\n\nAluko contends that the government established his involvement in\n\nonly ten of  the one hundred  and twenty-four fraudulent  claims,\n\nand that  he can only be  held responsible for those  ten claims.\n\nHe  asserts that  the  rest of  the  claims were  actions of  co-\n\nconspirators which were not  reasonably foreseeable to him.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1),  Application  Note 1  (Nov.  1991)  (for\n\nsentencing  purposes, defendant  is accountable  for \"conduct  of\n\nothers  in  furtherance of  the  execution  of jointly-undertaken\n\ncriminal   activity  that  was   reasonably  foreseeable  by  the\n                                                        \n\ndefendant\") (emphasis added).\n\n          In  its  sentencing ruling,  the  district court  never\n\ndiscussed whether Aluko's co-conspirators' additional one hundred\n\nand  fourteen fraudulent  claims were  reasonably foreseeable  to\n\nAluko.  The court simply concluded that Aluko\n\n            was a conspirator with two  other people.\n            He   was   an  important   part   of  the\n            conspiracy  regardless  of the  numerical\n            figures  involved in claims  filed, or in\n            amount of  money that he  received.   And\n            so,  he's  responsible   for  the   whole\n            conspiracy.  It's seldom that we find co-\n            conspirators who know  all facets of  the\n            operation.  They know they're involved in\n            a conspiracy and they're involved  at one\n            tier level or another and, therefore, are\n            integral parts and necessary parts of the\n            success of the whole conspiracy.\n\n            (sentencing hearing transcript at 14).\n\n          This language  suggests that once a  defendant plays an\n\nintegral  role in a  conspiracy, he is  liable for co-conspirator\n\n                               -5-\n\nacts  in  furtherance  of  the conspiracy,  regardless  of  their\n\nforeseeability.

In\n\nthis   case,  however,   it  appears   that  the   judge  thought\n\nforeseeability inherent  in all conspiracies.   This  is not  the\n                               \n\nlaw.\n\n          In addition, some of the co-conspirator acts presumably\n\noccurred before Aluko joined the conspiracy as he joined one year\n\nafter  it  began.   By definition,  acts  that occurred  before a\n\ndefendant enters  a conspiracy  cannot be foreseeable.

Indeed, the  record  in this  case\n\nadequately supports the district court's denial of the reduction.\n\nAluko indicated that his  involvement in the conspiracy  began on\n\nOctober 6, 1990.   He remained active in the  conspiracy until he\n\nwas  arrested one  year later.   He was  directly involved  in at\n\nleast  ten fraudulent  claims.   Ultimately, the  court concluded\n\nthat Aluko was an integral part of the conspiracy and granted him\n\nno reduction.  We find no clear error in this determination.\n\nAppellant Balogun\n                 \n\n          Before Balogun's sentencing, the government objected to\n\nhis  presentence report,  claiming that  his total  offense level\n\nshould  have  been  increased  two points  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.\n\n  3B1.1(c)  (Nov.  1991).8   Specifically, the  government argued\n\n                    \n\n7  Section 3B1.2(a) provides:\n\n            If   the   defendant   was    a   minimal\n            participant  in  any  criminal  activity,\n            decrease by 4 levels.\n\n   Section 3B1.2(b) provides:\n\n            If the defendant  was a minor participant\n            in  any criminal activity,  decrease by 2\n            levels. \n\n8  Section 3B1.1(c) provides:\n\n            If  the  defendant   was  an   organizer,\n            leader,  manager,  or  supervisor in  any\n            criminal activity other than described in\n\n                               -7-\n\nthat  Balogun was  an \"organizer, leader,  or supervisor\"  of the\n\nconspiracy  for the  purposes of  that section.   The  sentencing\n\njudge accepted the government's representations and increased the\n\ntotal offense level from sixteen to eighteen.\n\n          Balogun  offers  two  principal  arguments  against the\n\njudge's calculation of his  sentence.  First, he argues  that the\n\ndistrict   court   impermissibly  relied   on   the  prosecutor's\n\nstatements  in  reaching  its   conclusion.    Balogun  does  not\n\nchallenge  the  facts  at   issue;  however,  he  challenges  the\n\napplication of   3B1.1(c) to these facts.\n\n          Application Note 3 of U.S.S.G.   3B1.1 counsels that in\n\ndetermining  whether  a defendant  is  an  organizer, leader,  or\n\nsupervisor  pursuant  to   3B1.1(c),  the  court should  consider\n\nfactors   including:     (1)  decision   making   authority;  (2)\n\nparticipation in the offense; (3) recruitment of accomplices; (4)\n\nclaimed  right to a larger share of  the fruits of the crime; (5)\n\ndegree of planning or organizing; (6) nature of illegal activity;\n\nand (7) degree of control over others.\n\n          The  undisputed facts  in  the present  case show  that\n\nBalogun  initiated the conspiracy with another co-conspirator; he\n\nreceived significantly more money from the conspiracy than Aluko;\n\nhe used cars fraudulently registered to Aluko to stage accidents;\n\nand he paid  Aluko for his cooperation in the scheme.  We find no\n\nclear error in the  district court's conclusion that Balogun  fit\n\nthe role of an organizer, leader, or supervisor.\n\n                    \n\n            (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          Second,  Balogun  argues that  the  sentence adjustment\n\nresulted in impermissible double  counting because in addition to\n\nthe  increase for being an organizer,  supervisor, or leader, the\n\ndistrict court also accepted the presentence report's enhancement\n\nof Balogun's sentence for more than minimal  planning pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2).\n\n          In United States  v. Fuller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537727\"><a href=\"/opinion/537727/united-states-v-leonard-r-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1222  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1990),  we reversed  an  enhancement  based on    3B1.1(c),\n\nnoting  our concern  that  such an  enhancement  would result  in\n\ndouble  counting.  The sentencing  court in that  case based both\n\nits   3B1.1(c)  and its    2F1.1(b)(2) enhancements on  one fact:\n\nthe quantity of marijuana involved.  See id.\n                                           \n\n          Balogun argues that the sentencing judge considered the\n\nelaborate  nature of the scheme  in applying the  increase for an\n\norganizer, leader, or supervisor  even though that complexity was\n\nalready  accounted   for  in  the  more   than  minimal  planning\n\nenhancement.   In support  of this contention,  Balogun notes the\n\nfollowing statements by the sentencing judge.\n\n            . . . I'm  satisfied that Mr. Balogun and\n            Mr. [Oyelele] were the organizers of this\n            scheme.  They were the people who thought\n            this matter up, maybe with help of others\n            unknown, and  Aluko was  just one of  the\n            people who was initiated into the scheme,\n            to  be part of some facets of it.  So I'm\n                                                     \n            satisfied that Balogun and [Oyelele] were\n                     \n            organizers and leaders and supervisors of\n            this matter. . . .\n\n            This  was a fairly  elaborate scheme, one\n            that required a lot of planning and a lot\n            of organization, and  a lot of fraudulent\n            documents.    And,  therefore,  I  think,\n            under   the   circumstances,  the   total\n\n                               -9-\n\n            offense level should be 20. . . .  \n\n            (sentencing transcript at 9) (emphasis added).\n\nAs we  see  it, this  language  shows that  the court  based  his\n\n  3B1.1(c)  enhancement decision on  Balogun's initiation  of the\n\nscheme and recruitment  of Aluko,  not on the  complexity of  the\n\nscheme.   The judge's allusion  to the scheme's  elaborate nature\n\nsimply  provided  further   superfluous  justification  for   the\n\nresulting   total  offense   level.     We   therefore  find   no\n\nimpermissible double counting.9\n\n          We affirm Balogun's sentence in its entirety.\n\n          Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n9   As an alternative  ground, we  note that as  Balogun did  not\nclearly raise this issue  in the district court, he  is precluded\nfrom raising it on appeal.
