After  entering  insolvency\n          SELYA,   Circuit  Judge.\n                                 \n\nproceedings,   plaintiff-appellant   Newport   Plaza   Associates\n\n(Newport),  a  Rhode  Island  limited partnership,  commenced  an\n\nadversary proceeding against Durfee Attleboro Bank (the Bank), in\n\nwhich it claimed that the Bank  failed to honor an oral agreement\n\nconcerning the resumption of financing for a stalled construction\n\nproject.    The  bankruptcy court  and  the  district court  both\n\nrejected the  claim.  The third  time is not the  charm:  because\n\nthe  record shows  beyond peradventure  that the  parties entered\n\ninto a  subsequent written contract, the terms  of which directly\n\ncontradicted,   and  therefore   superseded,  the   alleged  oral\n\nagreement, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On February 8, 1988,  Newport executed and delivered to\n\nthe   Bank  a   promissory  note,   construction  mortgage,   and\n\nconstruction loan agreement in order to finance the erection of a\n\nshopping plaza in Newport, Rhode Island.   Construction came to a\n\nscreeching halt that November due to difficulties between Newport\n\nand  its general contractor, DRL, Inc.   When DRL and a number of\n\nsubcontractors placed mechanics'  liens on the  property, Newport\n\ndefaulted on the loan.\n\n          Newport tried repeatedly to work out an agreement under\n\nwhich the Bank would be willing to restart the project.   Newport\n\nclaims  that  on December  20, 1988,  the  Bank agreed  to resume\n\nfinancing  the  work  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  original\n\nconstruction  loan  agreement  if  Newport,  within  a reasonable\n\n                                2\n\nperiod of  time, resolved the mechanics'  liens, brought interest\n\npayments current,  reaffirmed  occupancy commitments  from  third\n\nparties,  and replaced  DRL with  a suitably  qualified builder.1\n\nNewport also  claims that  it complied  with these conditions  no\n\nlater than March of 1989,  but that the Bank reneged on  the oral\n\nagreement.\n\n          On October  13, 1989,  with the project  still dormant,\n\nNewport  submitted a written proposal to the Bank anent continued\n\nfinancing.  This proposal did not mention the oral agreement.  By\n\nletter  dated November 1, 1989, the Bank notified Newport that it\n\nhad \"decided not to  allow restarting of the project.\"   Instead,\n\nthe Bank offered,  \"without waiving any . .  . rights,\" to accept\n\n$881,000 in full  satisfaction of the balance due ($1,381,000) on\n\nthe  promissory note.  The  Bank's terms required  Newport, if it\n\naccepted  the offer, to tender  $881,000 in a  lump sum within 90\n\ndays  and, in the interim,  to submit weekly  progress reports on\n\nthe status  of the project  and its efforts  to obtain  the funds\n\nneeded to buy  out the Bank's position.  The  letter, the text of\n\nwhich  is reproduced in the  appendix, gave Newport  two weeks in\n\nwhich to accept the offer.   It made no reference to  the alleged\n\noral agreement.\n\n          Newport's  partners  signed  and  returned  the  letter\n\nbefore the appointed deadline.   Thereafter, they failed to  make\n\nthe lump-sum payment within  the stipulated 90-day period.   When\n\n                    \n\n     1The Bank  steadfastly denies these allegations.   Since the\ncase was  decided  below  on  summary  judgment,  we  assume  for\nargument's sake that the oral agreement existed.\n\n                                3\n\nthe Bank  initiated foreclosure  proceedings, Newport  sought the\n\nprotection of Chapter 11.2\n\n          In  due course,  Newport filed  suit in  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  alleging a  breach  of the  oral  agreement.   After  some\n\nprocedural  skirmishing,  not  material  for  our  purposes,  the\n\nbankruptcy court granted the  Bank's motion for summary judgment.\n\nIn re Newport Plaza  Assocs., 129 B.R. 326 (Bankr.  D.R.I. 1991).\n                            \n\nThe court  held that  the letter exchange  constituted an  accord\n\nbetween  the  parties,  wherein  the  Bank  agreed  to  discharge\n\nNewport's  original  obligation in  return  for  Newport's timely\n\npayment of a  portion of the  outstanding balance.   Id. at  327.\n                                                        \n\nThe  court ruled that because  the Bank explicitly  stated in the\n\noffering  letter  that it  would  not  allow  restarting  of  the\n\nproject, and  Newport  accepted the  terms  of that  letter,  the\n\nexchange \"created new contractual obligations between the parties\n\nand replaced the  alleged December 20, 1988 oral agreement  . . .\n\n.\"   Id.  The bankruptcy court ruled, alternatively, that Newport\n        \n\nhad neither  established the existence  of an oral  agreement nor\n\nshown  performance of  its obligations thereunder.3   See  id. at\n                                                              \n\n327 n.1.\n\n          Newport  appealed.    The  district  court  convened  a\n\n                    \n\n     2The  bankruptcy  court,  following  a   contested  hearing,\neventually  granted  the  Bank's   motion  for  relief  from  the\nautomatic   stay.     The   foreclosure  proceedings   have  been\nconsummated.  \n\n     3Because  this appeal  is susceptible  to resolution  on the\nground that the letter  exchange extinguished any oral agreement,\nsee infra, we do not consider this alternative holding.\n         \n\n                                4\n\nhearing, afforded  de novo review, and  rendered summary judgment\n                          \n\nore  tenus.  In its  bench decision, the  district court reasoned\n          \n\nthat  whether an oral agreement existed was of no consequence, as\n\nany  such  agreement  was  \"completely  inconsistent\"   with  the\n\nsubsequent exchange of correspondence.  That correspondence,  the\n\ncourt   ruled,  constituted  an  accord,  superseding  any  prior\n\nagreement  between  the parties.   On  March  3, 1992,  the clerk\n\nentered final judgment.\n\n          Newport again  appeals.   The gist  of its  argument is\n\nthat the  district court  erred in holding  that, as a  matter of\n\nlaw, Newport  relinquished the right to  resuscitate the original\n\nfinancing arrangement   a right supposedly conferred by  the oral\n\nagreement    when it signed  and returned the  November 1 letter.\n\nBecause we agree with the district court that the letter exchange\n\nconstituted a  valid contract in which  the parties unambiguously\n\nexpressed their mutual intention  that the Bank would  not supply\n\nfunds  to restart  the project,  we  reject Newport's  attempt to\n\nenforce the prior oral agreement and affirm the entry of judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nII.  THRESHOLD LEGAL MATTERS\n\n          We  begin by  explicating certain  legal  principles in\n\norder to set the stage for a discussion of the merits.\n\n                A.  The Summary Judgment Standard.\n                                                 \n\n          The summary judgment standard  is familiar and has been\n\nfrequently  elucidated.   Rather than  attempting to  reinvent so\n\nserviceable a wheel, we  merely observe that, as the  civil rules\n\n                                5\n\nthemselves  provide, summary  judgment is  appropriate when  \"the\n\npleadings,   depositions,   answers   to   interrogatories,   and\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\n\nthat  there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled  to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c).  The opponent of  a properly focused Rule\n\n56 motion must demonstrate,  by competent evidence, the existence\n\nof a  triable issue  which is  both genuine  and material  to its\n\nclaim.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48\n                                           \n\n(1986); Garside  v. Osco  Drug, Inc., 895  F.2d 46, 48  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1990).  \"In this context, 'genuine' means that the evidence about\n\nthe fact is  such that a reasonable jury  could resolve the point\n\nin favor of the nonmoving party.\"  United States v. One Parcel of\n                                                                 \n\nReal Property, Etc. (Great  Harbor Neck), 960 F.2d 200,  204 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992).  \"In the same context, 'material' means that the fact\n\nis one susceptible  of altering the  outcome of the  litigation.\"\n\nRivera-Muriente  v. Agosto-Alicea,  959 F.2d  349, 352  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1992).\n\n          We afford  plenary review  to  the entry  of a  summary\n\njudgment.   Garside, 895  F.2d at 48.   In so  doing, this court,\n                   \n\nlike the courts  below, must read the  record in the  manner most\n\ngratifying to the party  opposing summary judgment, indulging all\n\nreasonable  inferences  in  that  party's  favor.    See  Rivera-\n                                                                 \n\nMuriente,  959 F.2d at 352;  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,  904 F.2d 112,\n                                                 \n\n115 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                        B.  Choice of Law.\n                                         \n\n                                6\n\n          In this case, the  underlying contract claim depends on\n\nstate  law.   The  parties briefed  and  argued the  case  on the\n\napparent  understanding  that   Rhode  Island  law  governs   the\n\nsignificance  of their  actions and  the interpretation  of their\n\nagreements.   Both  lower courts  adjudicated the  controversy on\n\nthat basis.   When opposing  parties agree to  the source  of the\n\nsubstantive law  that controls their rights  and obligations, and\n\nno  jurisdictional concerns are present, a court is at liberty to\n\naccept such an agreement without independent inquiry.  See Moores\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 n.2 (1st Cir. 1987); Mathewson\n                                                                 \n\nCorp. v.  Allied Marine Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850 , 853 n.3 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1987).  We do so here.\n\n                      C.  What's in a Name?\n                                          \n\n          The parties have expended considerable  effort debating\n\nwhether the November 1 letter agreement should be evaluated as an\n\naccord and satisfaction or as a novation.  We deem it unnecessary\n\nto venture into this Serbonian bog.\n\n          The  Rhode  Island   Supreme  Court  has  traditionally\n\nmanifested a  concern with  substance  rather than  form in  this\n\nfuliginous  corner of  the  law, hesitating  to  draw fine  lines\n\nbetween  these two  closely  allied kinds  of contracts  where no\n\nnecessity exists for  doing so.   See,  e.g., Mello  v. Coy  Real\n                                                                 \n\nEstate  Co.,  234  A.2d  667,  671-72  (R.I. 1967)  (noting  that\n           \n\ndissimilarities  between the  two theories  are frequently  of no\n\nconcern,  as  both  \"operate  to  discharge all  the  rights  and\n\nobligations emanating from a  prior agreement\"); Salo Landscape &amp;\n                                                                 \n\n                                7\n\nConstr. Co. v. Liberty Elec. Co., 376 A.2d 1379, 1382 (R.I. 1977)\n                                \n\n(holding that, when the parties' subsequent agreement created new\n\ncontractual  rights  and  obligations  which  extinguished  those\n\narising  under the original contract,  \"it matters not\" whether a\n\ncourt  refers  to  the  subsequent  agreement  as an  accord  and\n\nsatisfaction  or as a rescission  followed by the  formation of a\n\nnew contract); see also Masse  v. Masse, 313 A.2d 642,  645 (R.I.\n                                       \n\n1974)   (stating  that  either   a  release  or   an  accord  and\n\nsatisfaction of  an alimony  judgment \"will  bind the  parties if\n\nfully complied with and supported  by sufficient consideration\").\n\nFederal courts,  construing state  law, have often  exhibited the\n\nsame  disinclination.     For  example,   the  Seventh   Circuit,\n\nconfronted with  an analogous  fact  pattern, chose  practicality\n\nover pettifoggery.  See Calder v. Camp Grove State Bank, 892 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n629,  633 (7th Cir. 1990)  (concluding that a  \"difference in the\n\ncharacterization of  the [agreement] does not  affect the outcome\n\nof  this case, since, under Illinois law releases, novations, and\n\naccords  and  satisfactions  are  all contracts  subject  to  the\n\nrequirement  of mutual  intent and the  constraints of  the parol\n\nevidence rule\").\n\n          The lesson to be learned from all of this is that, when\n\nit would serve  no useful purpose  to distinguish between  accord\n\nand satisfaction, on  the one  hand, and novation,  on the  other\n\nhand, courts should refrain  from performing what will amount  to\n\nno more than an exercise  in semantics.  So  it is here.  If  the\n\nNovember 1 agreement  constitutes a valid contract, it  binds the\n\n                                8\n\nparties  in substantially the same  manner whether we  call it an\n\naccord and satisfaction or a novation, operating to discharge all\n\nthe rights  and obligations  emanating from the  preexisting oral\n\nagreement.\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The  crux of  this appeal  involves a dispute  over the\n\ninterpretation of the letter agreement.  We have recognized that,\n\nin  certain circumstances,  summary  judgment  is an  appropriate\n\nvehicle for resolving contract-interpretation  disputes.  The key\n\nis the lack of any ambiguity.  See FDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 21\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1992);  see also Fashion House,  Inc. v. K Mart  Corp.,\n                                                                \n\n892  F.2d  1076,  1083 (1st  Cir.  1989)  (same  rule applies  in\n\ndirected-verdict context).   It is only when ambiguity looms that\n\nthe interpretation  of  contract language,  itself  acknowledged,\n\nbecomes a question of fact for the jury rather than a question of\n\nlaw  for the judge.  See Singh, 977  F.2d at 21; In re Navigation\n                                                                 \n\nTechnology Corp., 880  F.2d 1491,  1495 (1st Cir.  1989).   These\n                \n\nprinciples  are   in   overall  harmony   with   Rhode   Island's\n\njurisprudence.  See, e.g., Judd Realty, Inc. v. Tedesco, 400 A.2d\n                                                       \n\n952, 955 (R.I. 1979);  Fryzel v. Domestic Credit Corp.,  385 A.2d\n                                                      \n\n663, 666-67 (R.I. 1978);  O'Connor v.

Acceptance of the Agreement.\n                                                \n\n          We first address Newport's  claim that there remains an\n\nissue of disputed  material fact  as to whether,  by signing  and\n\nreturning  the November  1  letter in  the  manner requested,  it\n\nintended  to accept the proposed terms and thereby form a binding\n\ncontract.  Newport argues that, in the letter, the Bank agreed to\n\nrelease  Newport from  its loan  obligations only  upon Newport's\n\nperformance of three acts:   (1) returning the letter,  signed as\n\naccepted, within two weeks; (2)  delivering a certified check for\n\n$881,000  within  the  period  prescribed for  payment;  and  (3)\n\ntransmitting  written progress  reports  betweentimes.    Because\n\nNewport performed  only one  of the three  acts    return of  the\n\nletter     it envisions  an issue  of  fact regarding  whether it\n\nintended  to accept  the  November 1  offer.   Although  we  give\n\n                    \n\nlanguage.\n\n                                11\n\nappellant's counsel  high marks for ingenuity, we  do not believe\n\nthat the letter can be construed in so elastic a manner.\n\n          Under  Rhode  Island law,  the  Bank,  as the  offeror,\n\ncontrolled the offer and the terms of its  acceptance.  See B &amp; D\n                                                                 \n\nAppraisals  v. Gaudette Mach. Movers, Inc., 733 F.

It is  a basic  tenet of  contract law  that an\n\nofferor may, as a  condition of the offer's acceptance,  call for\n\nan act,  a forbearance, or a  return promise from the  offeree in\n\nexchange  for   the  offeror's  promise  or   performance.    See\n                                                                 \n\nMcLaughlin v. Stevens, 296 F. Supp.  610, 613 (D.R.I. 1969).   So\n                     \n\nlong as the offeror sets forth what is being sought in reasonably\n\ncertain  terms, he may bind the  offeree immediately by requiring\n\nacceptance  in the form of  a return promise  rather than through\n\nperformance.  See B &amp; D Appraisals, 733 F. Supp. at 508.\n                                  \n\n          Viewed  against  this   backdrop,  Newport's   position\n\nappears totally  irreconcilable with the unambiguous  language of\n\nthe  Bank's November 1 letter.   After setting forth the terms of\n\nthe offer, the Bank states the  terms of its acceptance:  \"If you\n\nare in agreement  with the terms  and conditions detailed  above,\n\nplease so indicate by dating, executing and returning one copy of\n\nthis letter  for our files.\"   This language  is nose-on-the-face\n\nplain:  the Bank  asked for a return promise    nothing more   as\n\nthe indicium of acceptance.\n\n          Should  any doubt linger, we are quick to remark that a\n\ncourt  is duty bound to construe contractual terms in the context\n\nof  the contract  as a  whole.   See Woonsocket  Teachers' Guild,\n                                                                 \n\n                                12\n\nLocal  951 v.

Here, the letter,  read in its  entirety,\n\ndispels  any possible  claim of  ambiguity.   It states  that the\n\n\"offer  will  expire November  14, 1989,  and  we must  have your\n\nsigned acceptance  in our hands by  2:00 p.m. on that  date.\"  It\n\nthen  notes that, should Newport accept the offer, the Bank \"must\n\nalso receive\" the  progress reports and  the lump-sum payment  as\n\npromised.\n\n          Words are  not endlessly malleable.   They have meaning\n\nand  content.   The  particular  combination  of words  that  the\n\nparties  utilized   here,  taken  in  the   stated  sequence,  is\n\nsusceptible of  no reasonable interpretation other  than that the\n\nparties  intended themselves  to be  fully bound  coincident with\n\nNewport's return of the letter, endorsed \"APPROVED AND ACCEPTED,\"\n\nby the date and time specified.  In contemplation of law, Newport\n\naccepted  the  terms  of  the  offering  letter  by  signing  and\n\nreturning it.\n\n               B.  The Effect of Newport's Consent.\n                                                  \n\n          Newport  also  claims that,  even  if  it accepted  the\n\noffer, there  remains a  question of  fact regarding  whether, by\n\ndoing so, it intended to relinquish its right to sue the Bank for\n\nfailure  to resume  financing the  project pursuant  to  the oral\n\nagreement.   This claim rests chiefly on an affidavit from Ronald\n\nKutrieb, one of Newport's principals, professing his belief that,\n\nin signing the letter,  he was not surrendering  Newport's rights\n\n                                13\n\nunder  the oral agreement.6  In our view, this initiative ignores\n\nboth unambiguous language and settled law.  We explain briefly.\n\n          As we have previously  indicated, the plain language of\n\nthe November 1 letter is difficult to overcome.  To  be sure, the\n\nletter  made   no  reference  to  the   earlier  oral  agreement.\n\nNevertheless,  the   Bank  did  not  mince  words.    The  letter\n\nunequivocally  stated  that the  Bank had  \"decided not  to allow\n\nrestarting of the  project.\"   These words are  definite.   Their\n\npurport is not contradicted  by any other term in  the agreement.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the quoted language, taken in context, is\n\nsusceptible  to no  other  reasonable interpretation  than as  an\n\nexpression  of the  parties'  mutual agreement  that construction\n\nfinancing for the  project would  no longer be  furnished by  the\n\nBank.\n\n          In such  clear-cut circumstances, the courts  below had\n\nno principled choice but  to hold that Newport, by  accepting the\n\noffer  in  the manner  indicated,  assented  to  the \"no  further\n\nfinancing\" term.  See Fireman's  Fund, 391 A.2d at 102;  see also\n                                                                 \n\nTheroux  v.

Contracts ordinarily depend on  objective\n\n                    \n\n     6The Bank's letter transposed  two vowels in Kutrieb's name.\nMoreover, one of Newport's  partners, Joseph J. Dabek, apparently\ndid not sign  the letter.  The parties do  not mention either the\nmisspelling   or   the   omission   and  we,   too,   deem   them\ninconsequential.\n\n                                14\n\nindicia  of consent,  not on  a party's  subjective expectations.\n\nWhen, as in this  instance, the parties' intent is  made manifest\n\nby  the express terms of a written agreement, fairly construed, a\n\ncourt  interpreting  the  agreement  should  not  look  to  \"some\n\nundisclosed  intent that  may have  existed in  the minds  of the\n\ncontracting parties but [should  be governed by] the intent  that\n\nis  expressed  by  the   language  contained  in  the  contract.\"\n\nWoonsocket Teachers' Guild, 367 A.2d at 205; accord Westinghouse,\n                                                                \n\n410 A.2d at 991  n.10; see also Smith v.

The Bank's explicit\n\ndisclaimer  of any  intention  to  restart  the  project  in  the\n\nsubsequent  letter  agreement directly  contradicts  the supposed\n\noral  agreement (wherein the  Bank allegedly agreed  to pour more\n\n                                15\n\nmoney  into the  project  upon Newport's  fulfillment of  certain\n\nconditions).    Given  this   direct  contradiction,  the  letter\n\nagreement, being  later in  time, necessarily superseded  any and\n\nall prior oral  agreements anent restarting construction.  It is,\n\nafter  all, settled  law  that,  if the  terms  of  a prior  oral\n\nnegotiation  are  dealt  with, or  covered  by,  a  later written\n\nagreement between the parties on the  same general subject, then,\n\npresumably,  the latter was intended to supersede the former, and\n\nshould be  so construed.

Since  the  Bank\n\nultimately foreclosed and retained the right to pursue collection\n\nof the  entire indebtedness,  this thesis runs,  Newport received\n\nnothing of value in return for relinquishing its rights under the\n\noral agreement.  We disagree.\n\n                                16\n\n          The  November 1  agreement  was  supported by  valuable\n\nconsideration on both sides.   For its part, the Bank was willing\n\nto  shave approximately  half  a million  dollars from  Newport's\n\noutstanding debt.  Although Newport would not reap the benefit of\n\nthis considerable  savings  unless and  until  it made  a  timely\n\npayment of $881,000, the  value of the opportunity, coupled  with\n\nNewport's forbearance  for the 90-day waiting  period, was itself\n\nsubstantial  and  furnished  valid  consideration  for  Newport's\n\nreturn promise.

CONCLUSION\n\n                                17\n\n          We  need go  no  further.   In  the November  1  letter\n\nagreement, the  parties unequivocally agreed that  the Bank would\n\nnot  resume financing  the ill-fated  construction project.   The\n\nletter agreement  superseded,  and thus  extinguished, all  prior\n\nnegotiations on the same  general topic.  This means,  of course,\n\nthat  Newport's attempt  to  sue for  a  failure to  restart  the\n\nproject pursuant to the parties' earlier oral agreement cannot be\n\ncountenanced even if such  an agreement existed at one  moment in\n\ntime.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                18\n\n                             APPENDIX\n\n                                       November 1, 1989\n\nNewport Plaza Associates, L.P.\nc/o Capital Growth Companies\nMr. Ronald E.

The  bankruptcy court  and  the  district court  both\n\nrejected the  claim.  The third  time is not the  charm:  because\n\nthe  record shows  beyond peradventure  that the  parties entered\n\ninto a  subsequent written contract, the terms  of which directly\n\ncontradicted,   and  therefore   superseded,  the   alleged  oral\n\nagreement, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On February 8, 1988,  Newport executed and delivered to\n\nthe   Bank  a   promissory  note,   construction  mortgage,   and\n\nconstruction loan agreement in order to finance the erection of a\n\nshopping plaza in Newport, Rhode Island.   Construction came to a\n\nscreeching halt that November due to difficulties between Newport\n\nand  its general contractor, DRL, Inc.   When DRL and a number of\n\nsubcontractors placed mechanics'  liens on the  property, Newport\n\ndefaulted on the loan.\n\n          Newport tried repeatedly to work out an agreement under\n\nwhich the Bank would be willing to restart the project.   Newport\n\nclaims  that  on December  20, 1988,  the  Bank agreed  to resume\n\nfinancing  the  work  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  original\n\nconstruction  loan  agreement  if  Newport,  within  a reasonable\n\n                                2\n\nperiod of  time, resolved the mechanics'  liens, brought interest\n\npayments current,  reaffirmed  occupancy commitments  from  third\n\nparties,  and replaced  DRL with  a suitably  qualified builder.1\n\nNewport also  claims that  it complied  with these conditions  no\n\nlater than March of 1989,  but that the Bank reneged on  the oral\n\nagreement.\n\n          On October  13, 1989,  with the project  still dormant,\n\nNewport  submitted a written proposal to the Bank anent continued\n\nfinancing.  This proposal did not mention the oral agreement.  By\n\nletter  dated November 1, 1989, the Bank notified Newport that it\n\nhad \"decided not to  allow restarting of the project.\"   Instead,\n\nthe Bank offered,  \"without waiving any . .  . rights,\" to accept\n\n$881,000 in full  satisfaction of the balance due ($1,381,000) on\n\nthe  promissory note.  The  Bank's terms required  Newport, if it\n\naccepted  the offer, to tender  $881,000 in a  lump sum within 90\n\ndays  and, in the interim,  to submit weekly  progress reports on\n\nthe status  of the project  and its efforts  to obtain  the funds\n\nneeded to buy  out the Bank's position.  The  letter, the text of\n\nwhich  is reproduced in the  appendix, gave Newport  two weeks in\n\nwhich to accept the offer.   It made no reference to  the alleged\n\noral agreement.\n\n          Newport's  partners  signed  and  returned  the  letter\n\nbefore the appointed deadline.   Thereafter, they failed to  make\n\nthe lump-sum payment within  the stipulated 90-day period.   When\n\n                    \n\n     1The Bank  steadfastly denies these allegations.   Since the\ncase was  decided  below  on  summary  judgment,  we  assume  for\nargument's sake that the oral agreement existed.\n\n                                3\n\nthe Bank  initiated foreclosure  proceedings, Newport  sought the\n\nprotection of Chapter 11.2\n\n          In  due course,  Newport filed  suit in  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  alleging a  breach  of the  oral  agreement.   After  some\n\nprocedural  skirmishing,  not  material  for  our  purposes,  the\n\nbankruptcy court granted the  Bank's motion for summary judgment.\n\nIn re Newport Plaza  Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Bankr.  D.R.I. 1991).\n                            \n\nThe court  held that  the letter exchange  constituted an  accord\n\nbetween  the  parties,  wherein  the  Bank  agreed  to  discharge\n\nNewport's  original  obligation in  return  for  Newport's timely\n\npayment of a  portion of the  outstanding balance.   Id. at  327.\n                                                        \n\nThe  court ruled that because  the Bank explicitly  stated in the\n\noffering  letter  that it  would  not  allow  restarting  of  the\n\nproject, and  Newport  accepted the  terms  of that  letter,  the\n\nexchange \"created new contractual obligations between the parties\n\nand replaced the  alleged December 20, 1988 oral agreement  . . .\n\n.\"   Id.  The bankruptcy court ruled, alternatively, that Newport\n        \n\nhad neither  established the existence  of an oral  agreement nor\n\nshown  performance of  its obligations thereunder.3   See  id. at\n                                                              \n\n327 n.1.\n\n          Newport  appealed.    The  district  court  convened  a\n\n                    \n\n     2The  bankruptcy  court,  following  a   contested  hearing,\neventually  granted  the  Bank's   motion  for  relief  from  the\nautomatic   stay.     The   foreclosure  proceedings   have  been\nconsummated.  \n\n     3Because  this appeal  is susceptible  to resolution  on the\nground that the letter  exchange extinguished any oral agreement,\nsee infra, we do not consider this alternative holding.\n         \n\n                                4\n\nhearing, afforded  de novo review, and  rendered summary judgment\n                          \n\nore  tenus.  In its  bench decision, the  district court reasoned\n          \n\nthat  whether an oral agreement existed was of no consequence, as\n\nany  such  agreement  was  \"completely  inconsistent\"   with  the\n\nsubsequent exchange of correspondence.  That correspondence,  the\n\ncourt   ruled,  constituted  an  accord,  superseding  any  prior\n\nagreement  between  the parties.   On  March  3, 1992,  the clerk\n\nentered final judgment.\n\n          Newport again  appeals.   The gist  of its  argument is\n\nthat the  district court  erred in holding  that, as a  matter of\n\nlaw, Newport  relinquished the right to  resuscitate the original\n\nfinancing arrangement   a right supposedly conferred by  the oral\n\nagreement    when it signed  and returned the  November 1 letter.\n\nBecause we agree with the district court that the letter exchange\n\nconstituted a  valid contract in which  the parties unambiguously\n\nexpressed their mutual intention  that the Bank would  not supply\n\nfunds  to restart  the project,  we  reject Newport's  attempt to\n\nenforce the prior oral agreement and affirm the entry of judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nII.  THRESHOLD LEGAL MATTERS\n\n          We  begin by  explicating certain  legal  principles in\n\norder to set the stage for a discussion of the merits.\n\n                A.  The Summary Judgment Standard.\n                                                 \n\n          The summary judgment standard  is familiar and has been\n\nfrequently  elucidated.   Rather than  attempting to  reinvent so\n\nserviceable a wheel, we  merely observe that, as the  civil rules\n\n                                5\n\nthemselves  provide, summary  judgment is  appropriate when  \"the\n\npleadings,   depositions,   answers   to   interrogatories,   and\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\n\nthat  there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled  to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c).  The opponent of  a properly focused Rule\n\n56 motion must demonstrate,  by competent evidence, the existence\n\nof a  triable issue  which is  both genuine  and material  to its\n\nclaim.

The  parties briefed  and  argued the  case  on the\n\napparent  understanding  that   Rhode  Island  law  governs   the\n\nsignificance  of their  actions and  the interpretation  of their\n\nagreements.   Both  lower courts  adjudicated the  controversy on\n\nthat basis.   When opposing  parties agree to  the source  of the\n\nsubstantive law  that controls their rights  and obligations, and\n\nno  jurisdictional concerns are present, a court is at liberty to\n\naccept such an agreement without independent inquiry.

So  it is here.  If  the\n\nNovember 1 agreement  constitutes a valid contract, it  binds the\n\n                                8\n\nparties  in substantially the same  manner whether we  call it an\n\naccord and satisfaction or a novation, operating to discharge all\n\nthe rights  and obligations  emanating from the  preexisting oral\n\nagreement.\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The  crux of  this appeal  involves a dispute  over the\n\ninterpretation of the letter agreement.  We have recognized that,\n\nin  certain circumstances,  summary  judgment  is an  appropriate\n\nvehicle for resolving contract-interpretation  disputes.  The key\n\nis the lack of any ambiguity.

Newport argues that, in the letter, the Bank agreed to\n\nrelease  Newport from  its loan  obligations only  upon Newport's\n\nperformance of three acts:   (1) returning the letter,  signed as\n\naccepted, within two weeks; (2)  delivering a certified check for\n\n$881,000  within  the  period  prescribed for  payment;  and  (3)\n\ntransmitting  written progress  reports  betweentimes.

This claim rests chiefly on an affidavit from Ronald\n\nKutrieb, one of Newport's principals, professing his belief that,\n\nin signing the letter,  he was not surrendering  Newport's rights\n\n                                13\n\nunder  the oral agreement.6  In our view, this initiative ignores\n\nboth unambiguous language and settled law.  We explain briefly.\n\n          As we have previously  indicated, the plain language of\n\nthe November 1 letter is difficult to overcome.  To  be sure, the\n\nletter  made   no  reference  to  the   earlier  oral  agreement.\n\nNevertheless,  the   Bank  did  not  mince  words.    The  letter\n\nunequivocally  stated  that the  Bank had  \"decided not  to allow\n\nrestarting of the  project.\"   These words are  definite.   Their\n\npurport is not contradicted  by any other term in  the agreement.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the quoted language, taken in context, is\n\nsusceptible  to no  other  reasonable interpretation  than as  an\n\nexpression  of the  parties'  mutual agreement  that construction\n\nfinancing for the  project would  no longer be  furnished by  the\n\nBank.\n\n          In such  clear-cut circumstances, the courts  below had\n\nno principled choice but  to hold that Newport, by  accepting the\n\noffer  in  the manner  indicated,  assented  to  the \"no  further\n\nfinancing\" term.  See Fireman's  Fund, 391 A.2d at 102;  see also\n                                                                 \n\nTheroux  v.

Contracts ordinarily depend on  objective\n\n                    \n\n     6The Bank's letter transposed  two vowels in Kutrieb's name.\nMoreover, one of Newport's  partners, Joseph J.

Since  the  Bank\n\nultimately foreclosed and retained the right to pursue collection\n\nof the  entire indebtedness,  this thesis runs,  Newport received\n\nnothing of value in return for relinquishing its rights under the\n\noral agreement.

Although Newport would not reap the benefit of\n\nthis considerable  savings  unless and  until  it made  a  timely\n\npayment of $881,000, the  value of the opportunity, coupled  with\n\nNewport's forbearance  for the 90-day waiting  period, was itself\n\nsubstantial  and  furnished  valid  consideration  for  Newport's\n\nreturn promise.

In  the November  1  letter\n\nagreement, the  parties unequivocally agreed that  the Bank would\n\nnot  resume financing  the ill-fated  construction project.   The\n\nletter agreement  superseded,  and thus  extinguished, all  prior\n\nnegotiations on the same  general topic.  This means,  of course,\n\nthat  Newport's attempt  to  sue for  a  failure to  restart  the\n\nproject pursuant to the parties' earlier oral agreement cannot be\n\ncountenanced even if such  an agreement existed at one  moment in\n\ntime.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                18\n\n                             APPENDIX\n\n                                       November 1, 1989\n\nNewport Plaza Associates, L.P.\nc/o Capital Growth Companies\nMr. Ronald E.
