Westcott\n                                            \n\nConstruction Co.  (\"Westcott\") appeals from an  order of the\n\nUnited  States  District Court  for  the  District of  Rhode\n\nIsland, Francis  J. Boyle, Judge, denying  Westcott's motion\n                                \n\nfor  summary  judgment  and  granting   defendant  Firemen's\n\nInsurance (\"Firemen's\") cross-motion  for summary  judgment.\n\nWestcott  sought to enforce the  terms of a performance bond\n\nexecuted by Firemen's on behalf of Westcott's subcontractor,\n\nCrouse Combustion  Systems (\"Crouse\"), in which Westcott was\n\nnamed  as  obligee.   In particular,  Westcott sought  to be\n\nindemnified for payments made to the City of Cranston, Rhode\n\nIsland (\"Cranston\"), for  damages suffered by the  town as a\n\nresult of Crouse's delays. \n\n          Westcott,  Crouse  and  Cranston   previously  had\n\nparticipated in lengthy arbitration proceedings in which the\n\narbitrators  had  established  damages  owed  by  Crouse  to\n\nWestcott and by Westcott to Cranston, as well as by Cranston\n\nto Westcott.   Westcott argues that the arbitrators were not\n\nasked  to  consider Crouse's  duty  to  indemnify and  that,\n\ntherefore,  this question is  open to the  courts to decide.\n\nWestcott initially petitioned  the arbitrators to reconsider\n\nthe  award.    After   that  request  was  denied,  Westcott\n\nunsucessfully sought  to vacate or  modify the award  in the\n\nRhode  Island state  courts  on the  ground  that the  award\n\nfailed  to consider Westcott's indemnification claim against\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nCrouse.    Westcott then  sought  relief against  Firemen's,\n\nCrouse's  surety  on the  performance  bond,  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the  District of Rhode Island, and\n\nafter losing there,  now seeks  redress in this  court.   We\n\nfind Westcott's appeal  clearly foreclosed by res  judicata,\n\nin  fact so clearly that we award  double costs on behalf of\n\nFiremen's.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          In  November, 1981, Firemen's issued a performance\n\nbond  to subcontractor  Crouse, with  Westcott, the  general\n\ncontractor,  as  obligee, for  a wastewater  treatment plant\n\nbeing built for the city of Cranston, Rhode Island.   When a\n\ndispute  arose  over  the  project,  Westcott,  Crouse   and\n\nCranston submitted  their damage claims to  arbitration.  On\n\nApril 25,  1989, the  arbitrators issued their  findings and\n\naward.   After finding  Crouse responsible  for much  of the\n\ndelay  damages, the  arbitrators  awarded Cranston  $314,000\n\nfrom Westcott and awarded  Westcott $384,000 from Crouse and\n\n$117,600  from Cranston  (for  delays caused  by the  city).\n\nWestcott  filed a  motion on  May 10,  1989, requesting  the\n\narbitrators to  reconsider the award as  it allegedly failed\n\nto require Crouse to  make good on its performance  bond and\n\nthus  to  indemnify  Westcott   for  the  $314,000  paid  to\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nCranston.    The arbitrators  denied  Westcott's motion  for\n\nreconsideration and modification of their decision.   \n\n          Westcott then sought to modify or vacate the award\n\nin  state court, arguing that  the award had  failed to pass\n\nthrough the  $314,000 in  damages to  Crouse.   The Superior\n\nCourt's  denial of  Westcott's  motion was  affirmed by  the\n\nRhode Island Supreme  Court,  Westcott Constr. Corp. v. City\n                                                            \n\nof  Cranston, 586 A.2d  542 (R.I. 1991)  (per curiam), which\n            \n\nconcluded  that   Westcott  had  submitted  its  claims  for\n\nadditional  damages to  the  arbitrators  and therefore  the\n\nclaim was not open to the court to decide.\n\n          Westcott  then brought  suit against  Firemen's as\n\nCrouse's  surety in the District of Rhode Island.  The claim\n\nwas dismissed.  Westcott now appeals.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\n          Westcott,  on this  appeal, requests  us to  award\n\nindemnification damages against Firemen's,  maintaining that\n\nthe question  of indemnication  was never considered  by the\n\narbitrators  or by  the state  courts.   The  district court\n\nruled against Westcott, finding this claim foreclosed by res\n\njudicata.    As  the  district  court  stated,  \"[i]t  seems\n\nabundantly clear to  me that the Rhode  Island Supreme Court\n\nhas  already considered  and decided  the controversy.\"   We\n\nagree with the  district court's assessment.  That the Rhode\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nIsland Supreme Court considered this issue is clear from the\n\nlanguage of  the opinion.   As that  court noted,  \"Westcott\n\nargues that the $1,000-per-day award to the city should have\n\nbeen  'passed through'  to Crouse  and that,  therefore, the\n\narbitrators' award  is  imperfect.\"   Westcott  Construction\n                                                            \n\nCorp., 586 A.2d at 543.  We fail to see how Westcott's state\n     \n\ncourt  claim differs from its federal one.  Indeed, it seems\n\nclear  that this issue  was submitted to  the arbitrators as\n\nwell.  Westcott itself, in its motion to the arbitrators for\n\nreconsideration and modification of their decision, admitted\n\nthat  \"[t]he  parties  agreed  at  the  initial  hearing  on\n\nSeptember  5,  1986  that  all   matters  between  Cranston,\n\nWestcott,  Crouse  and  the  other  subcontractors would  be\n\ndecided.\"   As Firemen's notes,  this statement demonstrates\n\nthat the  arbitrators  were  to  consider  Westcott's  claim\n\nagainst Crouse.   \n\n          Res Judicata bars Westcott's claim.  See Coates v.\n                                                            \n\nColeman, 51 A.2d 81,  85 (1947).  \"[A] state  court judgment\n       \n\ncommands the same res judicata effects in federal court that\n\nit would  have in the court that entered it.\"  18 Charles A.\n\nWright,  Arthur  R.  Miller  &amp;  Edward  H.  Cooper,  Federal\n                                                            \n\nPractice and Procedure   4469, at 659-60 (1981).  In Griffin\n                                                            \n\nv.  State of R.I., 760  F.2d 359 (1st  Cir.) (applying Rhode\n                 \n\nIsland law),  cert. denied, 474  U.S. 845 (1985),  the First\n                          \n\nCircuit explained that res  judicata operates as an absolute\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nbar  to the relitigation of the same cause of action between\n\nparties  (or  their  privies)  and  that  a  prior  judgment\n\nrendered  on the merits is conclusive not only to the issues\n\nwhich were determined but as to all matters which might have\n\nbeen determined as well.   Id. at  360; see also Corrado  v.\n                                                            \n\nProvidence Redevelopment Agency, 320 A.2d 331, 332 (1973).  \n                               \n\n          All the requirements for applying res judicata are\n\nmet  in this case.   As in Griffin,  the appellant \"contends\n                                  \n\nthat the  'causes of  action' in  Rhode  Island and  federal\n\ncourts differed, and thus argues that  res judicata does not\n\nbar her federal court action.\"  760 F.2d at 360.  And, as in\n\nGriffin, \"[a]n analysis of  the cause of action here  and in\n       \n\nthe  prior state proceedings  clearly establishes  that both\n\nare essentially the  same.\"  Id. at  361.  The  federal case\n                                \n\ninvolves the same subject matter and the same parties as did\n\nthe state  case,  and  contests the  same  point:  that  the\n\narbitrators  did  not  consider  Westcott's  indemnity claim\n\nagainst Crouse. \n\n          Firemen's, as surety, is only liable to the extent\n\nits  principal, Crouse, is  liable.  See  Rhode Island Hosp.\n                                                            \n\nTrust  Nat'l Bank v. Ohio Cas.  Ins. Co., 789 F.2d 74, 77-79\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986).   Firemen's benefits  just as  Crouse does\n\nfrom the  application of res  judicata.   Id. at 77.   Thus,\n                                             \n\nFiremen's, as surety for Crouse, is not legally bound to pay\n\nthe $314,000 Westcott seeks. \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          This   application  of  res  judicata  effects  no\n\ninjustice.   None of  the grounds justifying  departure from\n\nthe doctrine of  res judicata are present in this case.  See\n                                                            \n\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments   20 (1982); 18 Charles A.\n\nWright,  Arthur  R.  Miller  &amp;  Edward  H.  Cooper,  Federal\n                                                            \n\nPractice and Procedure    4435-4447 (1981) (earlier judgment\n                      \n\nentered without jurisdiction; improper venue; non-joinder or\n\nmisjoinder  of  parties;  prematurity;  failure  to  satisfy\n\ncondition precedent; and dismissal without prejudice).\n\n          After examining the history of this litigation and\n\nWestcott's repeated presentation of  the same issue, we find\n\nit appropriate to assess a  monetary penalty of double costs\n\nagainst  Westcott for a frivolous  appeal.  Fed.  R. App. P.\n\n38.  Rule  38 provides that \"[i]f  a court of  appeals shall\n\ndetermine that  an appeal is  frivolous, it  may award  just\n\ndamages and single  or double  costs to the  appellee.\"   As\n\nthis  Circuit  stated  in  Natasha,  Inc.  v.  Evita  Marine\n                                                            \n\nCharters,  Inc., 763  F.2d 468,  471 (1st Cir.  1985), \"[a]n\n               \n\nappeal  is  frivolous when  the  result is  obvious,  or the\n\narguments  are 'wholly without merit.'\"  Id. at 472 (quoting\n                                            \n\nNLRB v.

First, such suits  must be\n\ndeterred  in order  to  ease the  burden  on the  courts  of\n\nappeals  and, second,  in order  to protect  against \"strike\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nsuits\"  or  appeals brought  to delay  paying damages.

Westcott's attempt to distinguish its state\n\ncourt claims from those brought in the federal courts has no\n\nmerit  as res  judicata clearly  foreclosed  its claim.   In\n\nlight  of  this  determination,  we award  double  costs  to\n\nFiremen's.\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n                                   \n\n          We affirm  the district  court's grant of  summary\n\njudgment  to Firemen's on  the grounds  of res  judicata and\n\naward double costs.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n",

Boyle, Judge, denying  Westcott's motion\n                                \n\nfor  summary  judgment  and  granting   defendant  Firemen's\n\nInsurance (\"Firemen's\") cross-motion  for summary  judgment.\n\nWestcott  sought to enforce the  terms of a performance bond\n\nexecuted by Firemen's on behalf of Westcott's subcontractor,\n\nCrouse Combustion  Systems (\"Crouse\"), in which Westcott was\n\nnamed  as  obligee.   In particular,  Westcott sought  to be\n\nindemnified for payments made to the City of Cranston, Rhode\n\nIsland (\"Cranston\"), for  damages suffered by the  town as a\n\nresult of Crouse's delays. \n\n          Westcott,  Crouse  and  Cranston   previously  had\n\nparticipated in lengthy arbitration proceedings in which the\n\narbitrators  had  established  damages  owed  by  Crouse  to\n\nWestcott and by Westcott to Cranston, as well as by Cranston\n\nto Westcott.   Westcott argues that the arbitrators were not\n\nasked  to  consider Crouse's  duty  to  indemnify and  that,\n\ntherefore,  this question is  open to the  courts to decide.\n\nWestcott initially petitioned  the arbitrators to reconsider\n\nthe  award.    After   that  request  was  denied,  Westcott\n\nunsucessfully sought  to vacate or  modify the award  in the\n\nRhode  Island state  courts  on the  ground  that the  award\n\nfailed  to consider Westcott's indemnification claim against\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nCrouse.    Westcott then  sought  relief against  Firemen's,\n\nCrouse's  surety  on the  performance  bond,  in the  United\n\nStates District Court for the  District of Rhode Island, and\n\nafter losing there,  now seeks  redress in this  court.   We\n\nfind Westcott's appeal  clearly foreclosed by res  judicata,\n\nin  fact so clearly that we award  double costs on behalf of\n\nFiremen's.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          In  November, 1981, Firemen's issued a performance\n\nbond  to subcontractor  Crouse, with  Westcott, the  general\n\ncontractor,  as  obligee, for  a wastewater  treatment plant\n\nbeing built for the city of Cranston, Rhode Island.   When a\n\ndispute  arose  over  the  project,  Westcott,  Crouse   and\n\nCranston submitted  their damage claims to  arbitration.  On\n\nApril 25,  1989, the  arbitrators issued their  findings and\n\naward.   After finding  Crouse responsible  for much  of the\n\ndelay  damages, the  arbitrators  awarded Cranston  $314,000\n\nfrom Westcott and awarded  Westcott $384,000 from Crouse and\n\n$117,600  from Cranston  (for  delays caused  by the  city).\n\nWestcott  filed a  motion on  May 10,  1989, requesting  the\n\narbitrators to  reconsider the award as  it allegedly failed\n\nto require Crouse to  make good on its performance  bond and\n\nthus  to  indemnify  Westcott   for  the  $314,000  paid  to\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nCranston.    The arbitrators  denied  Westcott's motion  for\n\nreconsideration and modification of their decision.   \n\n          Westcott then sought to modify or vacate the award\n\nin  state court, arguing that  the award had  failed to pass\n\nthrough the  $314,000 in  damages to  Crouse.   The Superior\n\nCourt's  denial of  Westcott's  motion was  affirmed by  the\n\nRhode Island Supreme  Court,  Westcott Constr. Corp. v. City\n                                                            \n\nof  Cranston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2316621\"><a href=\"/opinion/2316621/westcott-construction-corp-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (R.I. 1991)  (per curiam), which\n            \n\nconcluded  that   Westcott  had  submitted  its  claims  for\n\nadditional  damages to  the  arbitrators  and therefore  the\n\nclaim was not open to the court to decide.\n\n          Westcott  then brought  suit against  Firemen's as\n\nCrouse's  surety in the District of Rhode Island.  The claim\n\nwas dismissed.  Westcott now appeals.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\n          Westcott,  on this  appeal, requests  us to  award\n\nindemnification damages against Firemen's,  maintaining that\n\nthe question  of indemnication  was never considered  by the\n\narbitrators  or by  the state  courts.   The  district court\n\nruled against Westcott, finding this claim foreclosed by res\n\njudicata.    As  the  district  court  stated,  \"[i]t  seems\n\nabundantly clear to  me that the Rhode  Island Supreme Court\n\nhas  already considered  and decided  the controversy.\"   We\n\nagree with the  district court's assessment.  That the Rhode\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nIsland Supreme Court considered this issue is clear from the\n\nlanguage of  the opinion.   As that  court noted,  \"Westcott\n\nargues that the $1,000-per-day award to the city should have\n\nbeen  'passed through'  to Crouse  and that,  therefore, the\n\narbitrators' award  is  imperfect.\"   Westcott  Construction\n                                                            \n\nCorp., 586 A.2d at 543.  We fail to see how Westcott's state\n     \n\ncourt  claim differs from its federal one.  Indeed, it seems\n\nclear  that this issue  was submitted to  the arbitrators as\n\nwell.  Westcott itself, in its motion to the arbitrators for\n\nreconsideration and modification of their decision, admitted\n\nthat  \"[t]he  parties  agreed  at  the  initial  hearing  on\n\nSeptember  5,  1986  that  all   matters  between  Cranston,\n\nWestcott,  Crouse  and  the  other  subcontractors would  be\n\ndecided.\"   As Firemen's notes,  this statement demonstrates\n\nthat the  arbitrators  were  to  consider  Westcott's  claim\n\nagainst Crouse.   \n\n          Res Judicata bars Westcott's claim.

And, as in\n\nGriffin, \"[a]n analysis of  the cause of action here  and in\n       \n\nthe  prior state proceedings  clearly establishes  that both\n\nare essentially the  same.\"  Id. at  361.  The  federal case\n                                \n\ninvolves the same subject matter and the same parties as did\n\nthe state  case,  and  contests the  same  point:  that  the\n\narbitrators  did  not  consider  Westcott's  indemnity claim\n\nagainst Crouse. \n\n          Firemen's, as surety, is only liable to the extent\n\nits  principal, Crouse, is  liable.
