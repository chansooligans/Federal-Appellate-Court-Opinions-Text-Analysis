In  1991,   petitioner  New   England\n          Per   Curiam.\n                      \n\nIndustries,  Inc.  (NEI),  a  jewelry  manufacturer  operating  a\n\nfactory in Providence, Rhode  Island, received citations from the\n\nOccupational  Safety  and Health  Administration  (OSHA) alleging\n\nviolations  of   some  twenty  occupational   safety  and  health\n\nstandards.     These  citations   became  final  orders   of  the\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) pursuant\n\nto  a settlement  entered into  between  NEI and  the government.\n\nUnder  the terms of this  settlement, NEI agreed,  inter alia, to\n                                                             \n\nabate and correct the cited violations by specific dates in 1991.\n\n          By  the start  of  1992, OSHA  still  had not  received\n\nverification  that  NEI  had  completed  the  agreed corrections.\n\nThus, it conducted  a follow-up inspection  on January 23,  1992.\n\nThis inspection resulted in the  issuance, on February 13,  1992,\n\nof citations alleging failures to abate five of the earlier cited\n\nviolations, as well as  some new citations for  so-called \"repeat\n\nviolations.\"  NEI contested the citations.  On December 18, 1992,\n\nthe  Secretary of Labor moved for summary judgment with regard to\n\nsix of  the alleged violations (some  from each group).   NEI did\n\nnot oppose the initiative, and  an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\n\ngranted summary judgment on January 11,  1993.  On January 20,  a\n\nhearing  was held  on the  remaining three  violations.   The ALJ\n\nthereafter wrote a decision finding that the remaining violations\n\nhad  occurred,  affirming  all  nine   citations,  and  assessing\n\npenalties as proposed by  the Secretary.  OSHRC  declined review,\n\nand the decision became a final order.  This proceeding followed.\n\n                                2\n\n          We have carefully reviewed the record and the appellate\n\nbriefs.   We find  that, for  the most  part, the arguments  that\n\npetitioner  seeks to  raise  in this  court  were not  seasonably\n\npresented  to the  ALJ and  are, therefore,  not  properly before\n\nus.1   See 29 U.S.C.    660(a); see also Eagle  Eye Fishing Corp.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

As we  have stated, \"[i]n the usual  administrative law\n\ncase,  a  court  ought not  to  consider  points  which were  not\n\nseasonably  raised before  the agency.\"   Massachusetts  Dep't of\n                                                                 \n\nPub.

Nothing  about the\n                    \n\ninstant case removes it from the sweep of the general rule.\n\n          We need go  no further.   Apart from  issues that  have\n\nbeen   procedurally  defaulted,   petitioner  raises   no  fairly\n\ndebatable  issues  of  either  law  or fact.    Consequently,  we\n\nsummarily  dismiss the petitions for review, see 1st Cir. R.27.1,\n                                                \n\nand direct enforcement of the challenged order.\n\n          The petitions for review  are denied and dismissed, and\n                                                                 \n\nthe orders appealed from will be enforced.

We  often have  warned that, in  the summary  judgment\ncontext,  \"the  decision to  sit idly  by  and allow  the summary\njudgment proponent  to configure the  record is  likely to  prove\nfraught with consequence.\"  Kelly v.
