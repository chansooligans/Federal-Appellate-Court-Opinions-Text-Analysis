This  appeal arises  from\n                                   \n\nplaintiff  Maria  Sanchez's  claim that  Omar  Santiago  sexually\n\nharassed  her and that their employer condoned his behavior.  The\n\ndistrict  court dismissed the suit as time-barred.  We vacate and\n\nremand.\n\n                                I.\n\n     In 1988, Sanchez  was employed at  the Puerto Rico  Electric\n\nPower  Authority (PREPA).   She alleged that  from September 1988\n\nfor a period of approximately two years, Santiago, a fellow PREPA\n\nemployee,  harassed  her  sexually.     The  harassment  included\n\ninvitations  to dinner and to accompany Santiago to a motel, wolf\n\nwhistles,  taunts,  stalking,  threats  to harm  her  if  Sanchez\n\ncomplained  of  his  behavior,  and a  threat  against  Sanchez's\n\nboyfriend.\n\n     Sanchez lodged  a number of complaints against Santiago.  In\n\nNovember  1988,  Santiago  met   with  his  supervisor  regarding\n\nSanchez's complaints.   He denied any wrongdoing.   Sanchez filed\n\ncomplaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEOC) of\n\nPREPA  in December  1988 and  May 1989.   In  July 1989,  an EEOC\n\nofficer  allegedly  attempted to  persuade  Sanchez  to drop  the\n\ncharges  against  Santiago  and  recommended  that  she  confront\n\nSantiago  on  her own.    At  some point  in  1989,  PREPA issued\n\nSantiago a warning to desist his behavior.\n\n     Nonetheless, Santiago continued  to harass Sanchez, and  she\n\nfiled  a third  EEOC  complaint  in  April  1990.    A  drawn-out\n\ninvestigation followed.   On  July 2, 1990,  Sanchez submitted  a\n\nletter  of resignation,  effective  July  20.   She  stated  that\n\nSantiago's offensive  behavior, compounded by PREPA's  failure to\n\ndiscipline him, forced her to resign.  On  July 18, 1990, Sanchez\n\nmet a final time with  an EEOC officer.  She left  PREPA two days\n\nlater.\n\n     On July  17, 1991, Sanchez  filed suit against  Santiago and\n\nvarious  other  employees of  PREPA  (collectively \"defendants\"),\n\nalleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983, and  the Puerto Rico  Civil Code.1   The basis\n\nfor the suit was  the sexual harassment, condoned by  PREPA, that\n\nculminated in her constructive discharge.\n\n     Defendants  moved on  various grounds  to dismiss  the suit.\n\nThe motion was  referred to a  magistrate judge, who  recommended\n\nthat  the Title VII claim  be dismissed for  Sanchez's failure to\n\ncomply  with  administrative  filing requirements  and  that  the\n\nremaining claims proceed as timely filed.  Defendants objected to\n\nthe  latter  recommendation.    The district  court  agreed  with\n\ndefendants and  dismissed the entire complaint.   Sanchez appeals\n\nonly  that portion of the  order dismissing the  section 1983 and\n\ntort claims as time-barred.\n\n                               II.\n\n     We  review  the  dismissal  of plaintiff's  suit  under  the\n\nsummary judgment  standard because  the district court  relied on\n\n                    \n\n     1   Sanchez's  sister Teresa  also sued,  claiming emotional\ndistress damages  incurred  from supporting  Sanchez through  her\nordeal.  She was not, however, designated as an appellant  in the\nnotice to appeal.  Accordingly, she is not a party to the present\nappeal.  Pontarelli v. Stone, 930 F.2d 104, 108 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                            \n\n                               -3-\n\nmaterial other than the pleadings to determine defendants' motion\n\nto dismiss.  The  federal rules of civil procedure  provide that,\n\non a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, if\n\n\"matters  outside the pleading are  presented to and not excluded\n\nby the  court, the  motion shall  be treated  as one  for summary\n\njudgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 . . . .\"  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).   Defendants' motion  to dismiss therefore  was\n\nconverted to a motion for summary judgment.\n\n     Our review of summary  judgment is plenary, and we  read the\n\nrecord  in the light most  favorable to the  party contesting it.\n\nPagano v.  Frank, 983 F.2d 343,  347 (1st Cir. 1993).   We affirm\n                \n\nthe decision  below only  if we are  satisfied that  there is  no\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact and that defendants are entitled\n\nto judgment  as a matter of law.  Advance Financial Corp. v. Isla\n                                                                 \n\nRica  Sales, Inc.,  747 F.2d  21,  26 (1st  Cir. 1984).   We  now\n                 \n\nconsider  whether the  district court  erred in  determining that\n\nSanchez's suit was time-barred as a matter of law.\n\n     The limitations period for a  section 1983 claim is governed\n\nby the law of the  forum state.  Wilson v. Garcia, 471  U.S. 261,\n                                                 \n\n276,  280  (1985).   In Puerto  Rico,  the applicable  statute of\n\nlimitations is the one-year  period established for tort actions.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann., tit. 31,   5298(2);   Torres v. Superintendent of\n                                                                 \n\nPolice, 893 F.2d 404,  406 (1st Cir.  1990).  Accordingly, to  be\n      \n\ntimely filed,  Sanchez's section 1983  and tort claims  must have\n\n                               -4-\n\naccrued within  one year  of July 17,  1991, the  date she  filed\n\nsuit.\n\n     The  district court found that Sanchez  filed her suit late.\n\nBecause  Sanchez  based her  resignation  on  PREPA's failure  to\n\naddress her complaints against Santiago, the court concluded that\n\nthe limitations period began  on the date she learned  that PREPA\n\nwould not  act and that this date was July  2, 1990, the date she\n\ntendered her resignation.  It thus ignored evidence in the record\n\nof events following that date.\n\n     Sanchez argues that the district court erred in finding that\n\nthe limitations period commenced July 2.  She contends that PREPA\n\ncontinued to refuse to discipline Santiago after that date.  From\n\n1988 through the date of her departure, Sanchez met with officers\n\nof PREPA  several  times to  seek redress  but failed,  allegedly\n\nbecause of PREPA's ongoing  policy not to discipline an  employee\n\naffiliated with the Popular  Democratic Party.  Her last  bid for\n\naction occurred July 18.  Sanchez therefore asserts that, because\n\nPREPA's   unlawful  practice  continued   until  she   left,  the\n\nlimitations period did not begin to run until July 20.\n\n     A claim  alleging a violation  that occurs over  an extended\n\nperiod  is timely  so long  as some  of the challenged  acts fall\n\nwithin  the statutory period.  See Bruno v. Western Electric Co.,\n                                                                \n\n829 F.2d 957,  960 (10th Cir. 1987); Goldman  v. Sears, Roebuck &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 607 F.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir. 1979).  This claim will not be\n   \n\nsaved, however, if only the consequences of the alleged violation\n\n                               -5-\n\nfall within the limitations period.  De Leon Otero v. Rubero, 820\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 18, 19 (1st Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).\n\n     We  conclude  that Sanchez  has raised  sufficient questions\n\nregarding  the  continuation  of  PREPA's  alleged  violation  to\n\npreclude  summary judgment  for  defendants at  this  preliminary\n\nstage  of   the  proceeding.    After  July  2,  both  Santiago's\n\nsupervisor and the director  of human resources assured Sanchez's\n\nsupervisor that  the investigation  of her charges  was still  in\n\nprogress.   Sanchez  also met  with the  EEOC on  July 18,  in an\n\napparent last-ditch  effort to determine whether  relief could be\n\nobtained.    A  factfinder  could  determine  that  these  events\n\ndemonstrate  foot-dragging by  PREPA,  consistent with  Sanchez's\n\ntheory that it did  not want to discipline Santiago, or that they\n\ndemonstrate  that Sanchez could  not be  certain until  after the\n\nJuly 18 meeting that PREPA would  not act.  Based on this record,\n\nwe are persuaded  that defendants have  not shown that  Sanchez's\n\nsuit is time-barred as a matter of law.2  \n\n     Defendants rely heavily on  Delaware State College v. Ricks,\n                                                                \n\n449  U.S.  250,  257-58  (1980),  to  argue  that  Sanchez cannot\n\ndemonstrate a violation that continues past July 2.  In our view,\n\nhowever, this case is distinguishable from Ricks.   The plaintiff\n                                                \n\nthere  was  denied tenure  in March  1974.   Following  its usual\n\npractice, the  college offered him a  one-year terminal contract,\n\nwhich expired in June 1975.   In April 1975, Ricks filed a charge\n\n                    \n\n     2  Because we find that the district court was  premature in\ndetermining the  accrual date  of Sanchez's claims,  we need  not\ndiscuss the issue of equitable tolling.\n\n                               -6-\n\nof discrimination with the EEOC.  The Supreme Court held that the\n\nfiling was not timely because Ricks's claim accrued from the date\n\nof the alleged discriminatory  action -- the denial of  tenure --\n\nnot  from the  date of  actual termination,  which was  merely \"a\n\ndelayed,  but inevitable,  consequence\"  of the  unlawful action.\n\nId. at 257-58.  \n  \n\n     The  Court  placed  great   emphasis  on  the  finality  and\n\ncertainty of the  college's decision to deny tenure,  noting that\n\nit capped an \"unbroken array of negative decisions.\"  Id. at 262.\n                                                        \n\nNo  subsequent action  by  Ricks  alone  could secure  tenure  or\n\nprevent his eventual departure.  We therefore understand Ricks to\n                                                              \n\nrequire  that   a  decision  to  terminate   employment  must  be\n\n\"unequivocal,  and   communicated  in  a  manner   such  that  no\n\nreasonable  person could think there might be a retreat or change\n\nin  position prior to the termination.\"  See Hoesterey v. City of\n                                                                 \n\nCathedral City, 945 F.2d 317, 320 (9th Cir. 1991).  \n              \n\n     By contrast,  the letter of resignation  from Sanchez lacked\n\nsuch  finality.   Although Sanchez  submitted her  resignation on\n\nJuly 2, she reserved 18 days for it to take effect.  This waiting\n\nperiod reasonably could indicate, as Sanchez avers, that if PREPA\n\nended  the hostile  atmosphere forcing  her departure,  she might\n\nrescind  her  resignation.   Thus,  until she  actually  left her\n\nemployment, her constructive discharge was not certain.\n\n     We emphasize  that our decision  expresses no view  upon the\n\nmerits of Sanchez's claims.  On remand, she still must prove that\n\n                               -7-\n\ndefendants refused to  act and that  they maintained this  policy\n\nduring the limitations period.\n\n     Vacated and remanded.  No costs.\n                                    \n\n                               -8-\n",

She alleged that  from September 1988\n\nfor a period of approximately two years, Santiago, a fellow PREPA\n\nemployee,  harassed  her  sexually.     The  harassment  included\n\ninvitations  to dinner and to accompany Santiago to a motel, wolf\n\nwhistles,  taunts,  stalking,  threats  to harm  her  if  Sanchez\n\ncomplained  of  his  behavior,  and a  threat  against  Sanchez's\n\nboyfriend.\n\n     Sanchez lodged  a number of complaints against Santiago.

She left  PREPA two days\n\nlater.\n\n     On July  17, 1991, Sanchez  filed suit against  Santiago and\n\nvarious  other  employees of  PREPA  (collectively \"defendants\"),\n\nalleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983, and  the Puerto Rico  Civil Code.1   The basis\n\nfor the suit was  the sexual harassment, condoned by  PREPA, that\n\nculminated in her constructive discharge.\n\n     Defendants  moved on  various grounds  to dismiss  the suit.\n\nThe motion was  referred to a  magistrate judge, who  recommended\n\nthat  the Title VII claim  be dismissed for  Sanchez's failure to\n\ncomply  with  administrative  filing requirements  and  that  the\n\nremaining claims proceed as timely filed.  Defendants objected to\n\nthe  latter  recommendation.    The district  court  agreed  with\n\ndefendants and  dismissed the entire complaint.   Sanchez appeals\n\nonly  that portion of the  order dismissing the  section 1983 and\n\ntort claims as time-barred.\n\n                               II.\n\n     We  review  the  dismissal  of plaintiff's  suit  under  the\n\nsummary judgment  standard because  the district court  relied on\n\n                    \n\n     1   Sanchez's  sister Teresa  also sued,  claiming emotional\ndistress damages  incurred  from supporting  Sanchez through  her\nordeal.  She was not, however, designated as an appellant  in the\nnotice to appeal.  Accordingly, she is not a party to the present\nappeal.  Pontarelli v.

Accordingly, to  be\n      \n\ntimely filed,  Sanchez's section 1983  and tort claims  must have\n\n                               -4-\n\naccrued within  one year  of July 17,  1991, the  date she  filed\n\nsuit.\n\n     The  district court found that Sanchez  filed her suit late.\n\nBecause  Sanchez  based her  resignation  on  PREPA's failure  to\n\naddress her complaints against Santiago, the court concluded that\n\nthe limitations period began  on the date she learned  that PREPA\n\nwould not  act and that this date was July  2, 1990, the date she\n\ntendered her resignation.  It thus ignored evidence in the record\n\nof events following that date.\n\n     Sanchez argues that the district court erred in finding that\n\nthe limitations period commenced July 2.  She contends that PREPA\n\ncontinued to refuse to discipline Santiago after that date.  From\n\n1988 through the date of her departure, Sanchez met with officers\n\nof PREPA  several  times to  seek redress  but failed,  allegedly\n\nbecause of PREPA's ongoing  policy not to discipline an  employee\n\naffiliated with the Popular  Democratic Party.  Her last  bid for\n\naction occurred July 18.  Sanchez therefore asserts that, because\n\nPREPA's   unlawful  practice  continued   until  she   left,  the\n\nlimitations period did not begin to run until July 20.\n\n     A claim  alleging a violation  that occurs over  an extended\n\nperiod  is timely  so long  as some  of the challenged  acts fall\n\nwithin  the statutory period.

After  July  2,  both  Santiago's\n\nsupervisor and the director  of human resources assured Sanchez's\n\nsupervisor that  the investigation  of her charges  was still  in\n\nprogress.   Sanchez  also met  with the  EEOC on  July 18,  in an\n\napparent last-ditch  effort to determine whether  relief could be\n\nobtained.    A  factfinder  could  determine  that  these  events\n\ndemonstrate  foot-dragging by  PREPA,  consistent with  Sanchez's\n\ntheory that it did  not want to discipline Santiago, or that they\n\ndemonstrate  that Sanchez could  not be  certain until  after the\n\nJuly 18 meeting that PREPA would  not act.  Based on this record,\n\nwe are persuaded  that defendants have  not shown that  Sanchez's\n\nsuit is time-barred as a matter of law.2  \n\n     Defendants rely heavily on  Delaware State College v. Ricks,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  257-58  (1980),  to  argue  that  Sanchez cannot\n\ndemonstrate a violation that continues past July 2.  In our view,\n\nhowever, this case is distinguishable from Ricks.   The plaintiff\n                                                \n\nthere  was  denied tenure  in March  1974.   Following  its usual\n\npractice, the  college offered him a  one-year terminal contract,\n\nwhich expired in June 1975.   In April 1975, Ricks filed a charge\n\n                    \n\n     2  Because we find that the district court was  premature in\ndetermining the  accrual date  of Sanchez's claims,  we need  not\ndiscuss the issue of equitable tolling.\n\n                               -6-\n\nof discrimination with the EEOC.  The Supreme Court held that the\n\nfiling was not timely because Ricks's claim accrued from the date\n\nof the alleged discriminatory  action -- the denial of  tenure --\n\nnot  from the  date of  actual termination,  which was  merely \"a\n\ndelayed,  but inevitable,  consequence\"  of the  unlawful action.\n\nId. at 257-58.  \n  \n\n     The  Court  placed  great   emphasis  on  the  finality  and\n\ncertainty of the  college's decision to deny tenure,  noting that\n\nit capped an \"unbroken array of negative decisions.\"  Id. at 262.\n                                                        \n\nNo  subsequent action  by  Ricks  alone  could secure  tenure  or\n\nprevent his eventual departure.  We therefore understand Ricks to\n                                                              \n\nrequire  that   a  decision  to  terminate   employment  must  be\n\n\"unequivocal,  and   communicated  in  a  manner   such  that  no\n\nreasonable  person could think there might be a retreat or change\n\nin  position prior to the termination.\"  See Hoesterey v. City of\n                                                                 \n\nCathedral City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568606\"><a href=\"/opinion/568606/paul-r-hoesterey-v-the-city-of-cathedral-city-jack-r-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (9th Cir. 1991).  \n              \n\n     By contrast,  the letter of resignation  from Sanchez lacked\n\nsuch  finality.   Although Sanchez  submitted her  resignation on\n\nJuly 2, she reserved 18 days for it to take effect.  This waiting\n\nperiod reasonably could indicate, as Sanchez avers, that if PREPA\n\nended  the hostile  atmosphere forcing  her departure,  she might\n\nrescind  her  resignation.   Thus,  until she  actually  left her\n\nemployment, her constructive discharge was not certain.\n\n     We emphasize  that our decision  expresses no view  upon the\n\nmerits of Sanchez's claims.  On remand, she still must prove that\n\n                               -7-\n\ndefendants refused to  act and that  they maintained this  policy\n\nduring the limitations period.\n\n     Vacated and remanded.
