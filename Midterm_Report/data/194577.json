Lopez-Romo, United  States Attorney, and  Hernan Rios, Jr.,\n                                                                   \nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n     COFFIN,  Senior  Circuit  Judge.    Defendant  appeals  from\n                                    \n\njudgments  of conviction  for importing  cocaine into  the United\n\nStates,  21 U.S.C.     952(a), and  for  possessing a  non-listed\n\ncontrolled substance on board  an aircraft, 21 U.S.C.    955.  In\n\naddition to having read appellate counsel's brief and listened to\n\noral argument,  we also have  read supplemental and  reply briefs\n\nfiled by appellant  himself.   Our conclusion,  after giving  due\n\nattention to all  claims, is  that we must  affirm the  judgments\n\nbelow.  \n\n                          A. Sufficiency\n\n     We  address first  whether  the evidence  was sufficient  to\n\nsupport  the verdicts.  Appellant testified to a series of events\n\nbeginning  with  meetings  at   his  father's  bar  in  Medellin,\n\nColombia, with two men who said that appellant  owed them a favor\n\nand who  wanted his  passport number and  photographs; continuing\n\nwith a rendezvous at a street corner; a taxi ride  to the airport\n\nand a  flight to the  island of  San Andres; the  receipt of  two\n\nheavy suitcases supposedly containing clothes,  as well as an air\n\nticket (purchased  by one person and reconfirmed  by another) for\n\ntravel from Nicaragua to Panama and then to Madrid, and $2,000 in\n\ncash; and subsequent travel to Panama for a three-day stay during\n\nwhich appellant called home a number of  times but did not reveal\n\nhis  whereabouts, fearing threatened  harm to  his family  if the\n\ntruth were told.  He also expressed his apprehension that unnamed\n\npersons were plotting to cut out one of his body organs.   \n\n     Appellant was apprehended when his plane landed in San Juan.\n\nHe  had   manifested  nervousness  and  the   customs  officials'\n\nsuspicions were  aroused by the  fact that his  passport revealed\n\nexits from  a country less identified  with narcotics trafficking\n\nthan Colombia.  The  two suitcases, bearing the claim  numbers on\n\nhis ticket, emitted a chemical odor; when samples of the suitcase\n\nmaterial  were tested,  they  revealed the  presence of  cocaine.\n\nAppellant, a  22-year-old student,  whose earnings  in connection\n\nwith his father's bar approached $13 a month, was found with cash\n\nand records of expenditure totalling over $4,000.\n\n     The most important  guide to note is  that the jury was  not\n\nobligated to believe appellant's testimony.It   could  disbelieve\n\npart or all of it.  It also could conclude that  the picture of a\n\nyoung man going without  information as to what he  was carrying,\n\nwhom he had  met, precisely where he was to go  or whom he was to\n\nsee upon arrival  in Madrid, possessed  of two excessively  heavy\n\nsuitcases, smelling of chemicals though purportedly carrying only\n\nclothes  and a substantial amount  of cash, was  an unlikely one.\n\nAs we said in a similar case involving an air  passenger en route\n\nfrom Colombia to  Madrid with cocaine-impregnated  suitcases, \"We\n\ncannot say that  a reasonable juror could not reason in this way;\n                                             \n\nor  that  such a  juror must  have a  reasonable doubt  about the\n                            \n\nconclusion.\"  United States v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936  F.2d 623, 624\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (emphasis in original).\n\n                               -3-\n\n                       B. Expert Testimony\n\n     Appellant also  challenges the  testimony of a  U.S. Customs\n\nchemist, who had been  qualified as an expert, and  who testified\n\nabout  the tests  he  had made  on  material extracted  from  the\n\nsuitcases.   The grounds for challenge are that the testimony was\n\nmisleading  and confusing  as  to  the  presence  and  amount  of\n\ncontrolled substance, and that the testing  technique used by the\n\nwitness was not trustworthy.  The witness possessed a B.S. degree\n\nin chemistry from the  University of Puerto Rico, had  done three\n\nyears  of graduate  work, and  had spent  five years  in training\n\nactivity while  on the job.  He had performed hundreds of tests a\n\nyear, and had  been qualified as an expert in  a number of cases.\n\nHe  testified  that  he had  had  experience  on  only two  prior\n\noccasions with drug-impregnated luggage  but had through  reading\n\nknown how to conduct accurate testing.  \n\n     At  the  end  of  cross examination  as  to  qualifications,\n\ndefendant's  trial  counsel  said,  \"That's   all,  your  Honor.\"\n\nWhereupon the court allowed  examination to proceed.  At  the end\n\nof  cross examination directed at  the testing and  at the method\n\nused  in extrapolating  the percentage  of cocaine  found in  the\n\nsamples to determine the amount present in the suitcases, counsel\n\nsimply  stated  that she  had no  more  questions.   No objection\n\nhaving  been  made  at any  time  to  the  qualifications of  the\n\nwitness, the  method or the results of testing, appellant's heavy\n\nburden  is to demonstrate plain error to the extent that manifest\n\ninjustice will result if  the judgment is allowed to  stand.  The\n\n                               -4-\n\nrecord   does  not   allow   appellant  to   carry  this   burden\n\nsuccessfully.    It  makes  clear that  although  the  method  of\n\nconcealing cocaine by impregnating  suitcase liners with the drug\n\nmay be  novel, the technique of  sampling, determining percentage\n\nof  the drug in the  samples, and extrapolating  to ascertain the\n\ntotal  amount   of  contraband  in  the  two  suitcases  was  not\n\nparticularly novel or exotic.   The specific half dozen  tests to\n\nwhich the  samples were  subjected to determine  the presence  of\n\ncocaine  base, such  as  ultraviolet  spectrophotometric and  gas\n\nchromatography tests,  have been widely accepted.   The method of\n\ndetermining the  quantity of  cocaine base  contained in  the two\n\nsuitcases  was  explained  carefully   and  at  length,  with  no\n\nsuggestion  that the method was novel.  Moreover, for purposes of\n\nsentencing, the court used an amount less than  one third of that\n\nextrapolated by the witness.\n\n     In his pro  se reply brief, appellant has cited  a number of\n\ncases, such as  Turpin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,  Inc., 959\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1349, 1352 (6th Cir. 1992) (involving the proof of causation\n\nof  Bendectin  birth  defects),  where the  state  of  scientific\n\nstudies, literature, and  opinion is in such  turmoil that courts\n\nbring  to  bear  \"close  judicial analysis\"  of  proposed  expert\n\ntestimony.  There is nothing in this record to place this case in\n\nthe company of those at the cutting edge of scientific inquiry.\n\n                         C. Other Issues\n\n     Appellant was allowed to  file supplemental and reply briefs\n\nraising  additional issues.  None  of these was  preserved in the\n\n                               -5-\n\ntrial  court.  Our consideration of them is therefore limited; we\n\nreview only to  prevent a  serious miscarriage of  justice.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States v. Newman,  No. 91-2303, slip op.  at 15 (1st Cir.\n                        \n\nDec. 31, 1992).\n\n     1.  The  fact  that  the  indictment  charged an  amount  of\n\ncontraband (10.9 kilograms of  cocaine) greatly in excess of  the\n\namount proven  (1,547 grams of cocaine  base) is not  a basis for\n\nreversal.   The discrepancy between charge and proof did not mean\n\nthat a  different or an additional offense  had been proven.  The\n\npetit jury  operated under  proper instructions for  weighing the\n\nevidence and in fact acquitted on Count I (charging possession of\n\na  large enough  amount  to indicate  an  intent to  distribute),\n\nshowing  that  it  was not  misled  into  thinking  that over  10\n\nkilograms of cocaine were involved.\n\n     2. The  same observation disposes of  appellant's contention\n\nthat Count III could not stand without Count I. \n\n     3. The fact  that the indictment charged that  the defendant\n\n\"knowingly and  willfully\"  committed the  offenses, whereas  the\n\nstatutes  contained no  such requirements,  could only  help, not\n\nhurt, defendant.  \n\n     4. Appellant's  concern over  the possibility that  Count II\n\n(21  U.S.C.   952(a)) and Count III  (21 U.S.C.   955) charge the\n\nsame  crime  and thus  violate  the  proscription against  double\n\njeopardy  has  been  specifically   addressed  by  us  and  found\n\nunjustified in  United States v. Franchi-Forlando,  838 F.2d 585,\n                                                 \n\n589-591 (1st Cir. 1988).  5.  Appellant  claims  that  the  court\n\n                               -6-\n\nshould have  given an  instruction  on the  possibility that  his\n\nactions were attributable to  duress.  There having been  no such\n\nrequest, we would need a much more persuasive record to fault the\n\njudge for not including an instruction on his own initiative.  \n\n     6. Appellant asserts error in sentencing by arguing that the\n\ncontrolled substance  involved was not cocaine  base but cocaine,\n\nor at least that there is uncertainty over this point.  But it is\n\nclear that the chemist identified it as cocaine base, without any\n\nobjection by  defense counsel,  and without  any evidence  to the\n\ncontrary.   Indeed,  the  chemist was  subjected to  considerable\n\nquestioning  regarding  the  distinctions  between   cocaine  and\n\ncocaine base.\n\n     7. Appellant also argues for a downward departure because of\n\nduress, and for an additional downward departure because of \n\nhis  asserted minimal  role  as a  mere  \"mule.\"   As  an initial\n\nmatter, we note that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider a\n\nrequest  for downward  departure.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nAmparo, 961  F.2d 288,  292 (1st  Cir. 1992).   This argument  is\n      \n\nequally unavailing  on the  merits.   What the  court did  was to\n\nassume an amount  (500 grams)  well below what  the chemist  felt\n\ncertain was proven (1,547 grams); this established a base offense\n\nlevel of 36.   The court then  granted a two-point reduction  for\n\nminor participation and another two-point reduction for accepting\n\nresponsibility.   This  produced  a total  offense  level of  32,\n\nwhich, for a  defendant with  a Criminal History  Category of  I,\n\ncalled for  a sentence within  the range of  121 and 155  months.\n\n                               -7-\n\nThe court imposed a sentence of 121 months. It  noted  that   the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence was 10 years, or 120 months.  Not only\n\nis the  support for further  downward departures  for duress  and\n\nminimal  role nonexistent, therefore,  but the  mandatory minimum\n\nfloor is an impassable barrier to any further meaningful relief.\n\n     The judgments  of conviction are not  attributable to errors\n\nof either court or counsel, but must be \n\n     AFFIRMED.    \n\n                               -8-\n",

The witness possessed a B.S. degree\n\nin chemistry from the  University of Puerto Rico, had  done three\n\nyears  of graduate  work, and  had spent  five years  in training\n\nactivity while  on the job.  He had performed hundreds of tests a\n\nyear, and had  been qualified as an expert in  a number of cases.\n\nHe  testified  that  he had  had  experience  on  only two  prior\n\noccasions with drug-impregnated luggage  but had through  reading\n\nknown how to conduct accurate testing.  \n\n     At  the  end  of  cross examination  as  to  qualifications,\n\ndefendant's  trial  counsel  said,  \"That's   all,  your  Honor.\"\n\nWhereupon the court allowed  examination to proceed.  At  the end\n\nof  cross examination directed at  the testing and  at the method\n\nused  in extrapolating  the percentage  of cocaine  found in  the\n\nsamples to determine the amount present in the suitcases, counsel\n\nsimply  stated  that she  had no  more  questions.   No objection\n\nhaving  been  made  at any  time  to  the  qualifications of  the\n\nwitness, the  method or the results of testing, appellant's heavy\n\nburden  is to demonstrate plain error to the extent that manifest\n\ninjustice will result if  the judgment is allowed to  stand.  The\n\n                               -4-\n\nrecord   does  not   allow   appellant  to   carry  this   burden\n\nsuccessfully.    It  makes  clear that  although  the  method  of\n\nconcealing cocaine by impregnating  suitcase liners with the drug\n\nmay be  novel, the technique of  sampling, determining percentage\n\nof  the drug in the  samples, and extrapolating  to ascertain the\n\ntotal  amount   of  contraband  in  the  two  suitcases  was  not\n\nparticularly novel or exotic.   The specific half dozen  tests to\n\nwhich the  samples were  subjected to determine  the presence  of\n\ncocaine  base, such  as  ultraviolet  spectrophotometric and  gas\n\nchromatography tests,  have been widely accepted.   The method of\n\ndetermining the  quantity of  cocaine base  contained in  the two\n\nsuitcases  was  explained  carefully   and  at  length,  with  no\n\nsuggestion  that the method was novel.  Moreover, for purposes of\n\nsentencing, the court used an amount less than  one third of that\n\nextrapolated by the witness.\n\n     In his pro  se reply brief, appellant has cited  a number of\n\ncases, such as  Turpin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580319\"><a href=\"/opinion/580319/34-fed-r-evid-serv-1206-prodliabrep-cch-p-13088-gary-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1352 (6th Cir. 1992) (involving the proof of causation\n\nof  Bendectin  birth  defects),  where the  state  of  scientific\n\nstudies, literature, and  opinion is in such  turmoil that courts\n\nbring  to  bear  \"close  judicial analysis\"  of  proposed  expert\n\ntestimony.  There is nothing in this record to place this case in\n\nthe company of those at the cutting edge of scientific inquiry.\n\n                         C. Other Issues\n\n     Appellant was allowed to  file supplemental and reply briefs\n\nraising  additional issues.  None  of these was  preserved in the\n\n                               -5-\n\ntrial  court.  Our consideration of them is therefore limited; we\n\nreview only to  prevent a  serious miscarriage of  justice.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States v. Newman,  No. 91-2303, slip op.  at 15 (1st Cir.\n                        \n\nDec. 31, 1992).\n\n     1.  The  fact  that  the  indictment  charged an  amount  of\n\ncontraband (10.9 kilograms of  cocaine) greatly in excess of  the\n\namount proven  (1,547 grams of cocaine  base) is not  a basis for\n\nreversal.   The discrepancy between charge and proof did not mean\n\nthat a  different or an additional offense  had been proven.  The\n\npetit jury  operated under  proper instructions for  weighing the\n\nevidence and in fact acquitted on Count I (charging possession of\n\na  large enough  amount  to indicate  an  intent to  distribute),\n\nshowing  that  it  was not  misled  into  thinking  that over  10\n\nkilograms of cocaine were involved.\n\n     2. The  same observation disposes of  appellant's contention\n\nthat Count III could not stand without Count I. \n\n     3. The fact  that the indictment charged that  the defendant\n\n\"knowingly and  willfully\"  committed the  offenses, whereas  the\n\nstatutes  contained no  such requirements,  could only  help, not\n\nhurt, defendant.  \n\n     4. Appellant's  concern over  the possibility that  Count II\n\n(21  U.S.C.   952(a)) and Count III  (21 U.S.C.   955) charge the\n\nsame  crime  and thus  violate  the  proscription against  double\n\njeopardy  has  been  specifically   addressed  by  us  and  found\n\nunjustified in  United States v. Franchi-Forlando,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501181\"><a href=\"/opinion/501181/united-states-v-orlando-franchi-forlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                 \n\n589-591 (1st Cir. 1988).  5.  Appellant  claims  that  the  court\n\n                               -6-\n\nshould have  given an  instruction  on the  possibility that  his\n\nactions were attributable to  duress.  There having been  no such\n\nrequest, we would need a much more persuasive record to fault the\n\njudge for not including an instruction on his own initiative.  \n\n     6. Appellant asserts error in sentencing by arguing that the\n\ncontrolled substance  involved was not cocaine  base but cocaine,\n\nor at least that there is uncertainty over this point.  But it is\n\nclear that the chemist identified it as cocaine base, without any\n\nobjection by  defense counsel,  and without  any evidence  to the\n\ncontrary.   Indeed,  the  chemist was  subjected to  considerable\n\nquestioning  regarding  the  distinctions  between   cocaine  and\n\ncocaine base.\n\n     7. Appellant also argues for a downward departure because of\n\nduress, and for an additional downward departure because of \n\nhis  asserted minimal  role  as a  mere  \"mule.\"   As  an initial\n\nmatter, we note that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider a\n\nrequest  for downward  departure.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nAmparo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/581358/united-states-v-luz-maria-amparo-aka-luz-maria-amparo-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  292 (1st  Cir. 1992).   This argument  is\n      \n\nequally unavailing  on the  merits.   What the  court did  was to\n\nassume an amount  (500 grams)  well below what  the chemist  felt\n\ncertain was proven (1,547 grams); this established a base offense\n\nlevel of 36.   The court then  granted a two-point reduction  for\n\nminor participation and another two-point reduction for accepting\n\nresponsibility.   This  produced  a total  offense  level of  32,\n\nwhich, for a  defendant with  a Criminal History  Category of  I,\n\ncalled for  a sentence within  the range of  121 and 155  months.\n\n                               -7-\n\nThe court imposed a sentence of 121 months. It  noted  that   the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence was 10 years, or 120 months.  Not only\n\nis the  support for further  downward departures  for duress  and\n\nminimal  role nonexistent, therefore,  but the  mandatory minimum\n\nfloor is an impassable barrier to any further meaningful relief.\n\n     The judgments  of conviction are not  attributable to errors\n\nof either court or counsel, but must be \n\n     AFFIRMED.    \n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
