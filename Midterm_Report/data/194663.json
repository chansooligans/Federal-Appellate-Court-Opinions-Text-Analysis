Charles Donald Lema,  convicted of  various\n    CYR, Circuit  Judge.\n                       \n\ndrug charges, appeals the dismissal of his petition for postconviction\n\nrelief  under 28 U.S.C.    2255.   Lema asserts that  his attorney was\n\nineffective, his  trial was  tainted by prosecutorial  misconduct, and\n\nhis sentencing proceeding was infected by factual error.  We affirm.\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n    In  1989,  following a  federal  undercover  operation,  Lema  was\n\nindicted  on two counts of conspiring with Raymond Souza to distribute\n\ncocaine to  Alex Hood, a DEA  informant, and on two  related counts of\n\naiding and abetting Souza's cocaine distributions.  The first brace of\n\ncounts charged that on December 15, 1988, Lema aided and abetted Souza\n\nin the sale of one kilogram of cocaine to Hood [the \"December transac-\n\ntion\"].  The second brace of counts charged that on  January 25, 1989,\n\nLema,  Souza, and  a third  man, Alberto  Monsalve-Zapata, sold  three\n\nkilograms of  cocaine to Hood  and another  undercover agent,  Michael\n\nBansmer, as  part of  a ten-kilogram  transaction negotiated by  Souza\n\n[the  \"January transaction\"].   The government  does not  dispute that\n\nSouza  took the most active  role in arranging  and consummating these\n\ntransactions; however, it suggests that Lema's culpability was reason-\n\nably inferable from his presence, with Souza, throughout both transac-\n\ntions,  and from certain telltale  statements made in  the presence of\n\nundercover officers,  indicating Lema's  knowing participation in  the\n\ndistribution scheme.2\n\n    Lema pleaded not guilty  to all charges.   Prior to trial, he dis-\n\ncharged  his  court-appointed  counsel  and  retained  David  Pomeroy,\n\nEsquire.   Lema  met  with  Pomeroy several  times,  and  emphatically\n\nexpressed his desire to testify  at trial.3  In furtherance of  Lema's\n\nstated desire to testify, Pomeroy filed a motion in limine to preclude\n\ncross-examination about  Lema's prior  criminal conviction for  inter-\n\nstate transportation of  stolen property.   The motion  was denied  on\n\nAugust 7, 1991.\n\n    Trial began the  next day.  At  trial, the defense contended  that\n\nthough Lema  may have been at  the scene of the  drug transactions, he\n\nneither actively participated in, nor was he aware of, Souza's cocaine\n\ndealings  on those occasions.  The government's case was based largely\n\non the testimony of Hood and Bansmer, who testified to Lema's presence\n\nat the  scene of the drug  exchanges.  The purport  of their testimony\n\nwas that it would have been  virtually impossible for Lema not to have\n\nknown that Souza was conducting drug  transactions on those occasions.\n\nAt the close of the government's case, Lema conferred with Pomeroy and\n\n                    \n\n2For a fuller description of Lema's involvement in these transactions,\nand his subsequent trial, see United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561 (1st\n                                                   \nCir. 1990).\n\n3Lema  also recommended that Pomeroy call  three witnesses to corrobo-\nrate his  story:  Souza,  Ann Marie  Burke, and Patricia  Lyons.   See\n                                                                      \ninfra at pp. 12-17. \n     \n\n                                  3\n\nagain expressed his desire  to testify.  Pomeroy no  less emphatically\n\nadvised Lema  that the government's case was weak and that    in light\n\nof the denial of the motion in limine    Lema's testimony would expose\n\nhim to  cross-examination concerning his prior  conviction, would lose\n\nthe sympathy  of the jury, and therefore would be unwise.  An argument\n\nensued,  witnessed  by  courtroom  observers; Lema  did  not  testify.\n\nPomeroy  then recalled one  witness, a DEA agent  who had attempted to\n\nrecord the  December  drug transaction  but failed  to capture  Lema's\n\nvoice on tape.  The defense rested.\n\n    At closing  argument, the prosecutor  acknowledged that Lema  said\n\nlittle during the course of  the two drug transactions, but  urged the\n\njury  to infer Lema's knowledge  of Souza's drug  dealings, and Lema's\n\nintent to participate in  the drug distribution scheme, from  the fact\n\nthat  Lema had been present  and remained silent  during both transac-\n\ntions.  Lema was convicted on all counts.\n\n    Thereafter, Lema, acting pro se, moved  for a new trial,  accusing\n                                   \n\nPomeroy of ineffective assistance.   At Lema's request, Pomeroy  with-\n\ndrew,  and successor counsel was  appointed to represent  Lema at sen-\n\ntencing.   The district court dismissed Lema's motion for new trial as\n\nuntimely.   The  court sentenced  Lema to  135 months  in prison.   We\n\naffirmed Lema's conviction on direct appeal.  See note 1 supra.\n                                                              \n\n    Undaunted,  Lema moved  for  vacation  of sentence  and new  trial\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.   The district court summarily denied  four of\n\nLema's habeas claims but reserved judgment on the fifth, which alleged\n\nthat  Pomeroy prevented  him from  testifying.   After  an evidentiary\n\n                                  4\n\nhearing,  a  magistrate-judge recommended  denial  of the  ineffective\n\nassistance claim.   The  district court thereupon  denied the  section\n\n2255 petition in its entirety.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n    This appeal has two  parts:  a  formal appeal, filed by  appellate\n\ncounsel,  asserting ineffective  assistance  by trial  counsel; and  a\n\nsupplemental pro se brief,  raising claims of prosecutorial misconduct\n                   \n\nand sentencing error.  We address each in turn.\n\nA.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\n                                     \n\n    The Sixth  Amendment guarantees criminal  defendants the right  to\n\neffective assistance of  counsel.  Strickland v.  Washington, 466 U.S.\n                                                            \n\n668, 687 (1984).  But \"[t]he Constitution  does not guarantee a defen-\n\ndant a  letter-perfect defense  or a  successful defense; rather,  the\n\nperformance standard is that  of reasonably effective assistance under\n\nthe circumstances then obtaining.\"  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d\n                                                            \n\n302, 309-10 (1st Cir.  1991) (citation omitted), cert. denied,  112 S.\n                                                             \n\nCt. 986 (1992).  A petitioner bears a very heavy burden on an ineffec-\n\ntive assistance claim.   The  habeas court must  \"evaluate the  [chal-\n\nlenged] conduct  from counsel's perspective at  the time,\" Strickland,\n                                                                     \n\n466 U.S. at 689, considering \"the totality of the circumstances before\n\nit,\" Perron v.  Perrin, 742 F.2d 669, 673 (1st  Cir. 1984), and making\n                      \n\n\"every effort . . . to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,\"\n\n                                  5\n\nStrickland, 466  U.S. at 689.   It \"must indulge a  strong presumption\n          \n\nthat counsel's conduct falls within a wide range of reasonable profes-\n\nsional assistance; that  is, the defendant must  overcome the presump-\n\ntion that, under  the circumstances, the  challenged action 'might  be\n\nconsidered sound trial strategy.'\"  Id. (citation omitted).  Moreover,\n                                       \n\nthe  court must not only  find that defense  counsel's performance was\n\ndeficient, but that it  was so prejudicial as to  undermine confidence\n\nin the  outcome of the trial,  see id. at 693-94,  and the fundamental\n                                      \n\nfairness of the result.  Lockhart  v. Fretwell, 61 U.S.L.W. 4155 (Jan.\n                                              \n\n25, 1993).\n\n    The  burden  is  on  the  petitioner  to  demonstrate  ineffective\n\nassistance by  a preponderance of the  evidence.  See Myatt  v. United\n                                                                      \n\nStates, 875 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1989); United States  v. DiCarlo, 575\n                                                                 \n\nF.2d 952, 954 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  439 U.S. 834 (1978).  Where a\n                                      \n\npetition  \"(1) is  inadequate on  its face,  or (2)  although facially\n\nadequate, is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files\n\nand records of the  case,\" DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954, summary dismissal\n                                                                      \n\nis appropriate.  Moreover, \"even a section 2255 petition predicated on\n\nspecific assertions of fact  allegedly supported in the record  may be\n\ndismissed  summarily by the district court,\" Barrett v. United States,\n                                                                     \n\n965 F.2d 1184, 1186 (1st Cir. 1992), provided \"the  district court can\n\n. . .

Lema now claims that Pomeroy's advice\n\nin effect prevented Lema from  testifying, and amounted to ineffective\n                   \n\nassistance of counsel,  see United  States v. Teague,  953 F.2d  1525,\n                                                    \n\n1532, 1534 (11th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 113 S.

The difficult  line courts must  draw between earnest\n\ncounseling  and overt  coercion is  guided by  several considerations,\n\nincluding:  (1)  whether the defendant  knew about his  constitutional\n\nright to  testify, and if not, whether he was informed by counsel, see\n                                                                      \n\n                    \n\n475  U.S. 157, 164 (1986) (\"[a]lthough this Court has never explicitly\nheld that a  criminal defendant has a due process  right to testify in\nhis own behalf . . . the right has long been assumed\").

We  review these district  court findings for\n\n\"clear error.\"  See  Ouimette v.

For example, in  an August 16,  1989 letter to  Lema,\n\nPomeroy  recalls, among other things, that Lema \"elected not to testi-\n                                                        \n\nfy,\"  after considering the effect  of the district  court's denial of\n\nthe motion in limine.  More generally, Lema was neither  a newcomer to\n\nthe  American justice  system nor  unaware  that he  had the  right to\n\ntestify in his own defense.  Indeed, the apparent vehemence with which\n\nLema at first  insisted on  testifying, as evidenced  by his  argument\n\nwith  Pomeroy, fairly may  have reflected Lema's  clear awareness that\n\nthe ultimate decision was his to make.  The district court supportably\n\nfound that Lema was not coerced into waiving the right to testify.5\n\n    2.The Failure to Call Proposed Defense Witnesses.\n                                                    \n\n    Lema asserts,  as a second  basis for the \"ineffective assistance\"\n\nclaim, that  Pomeroy neither interviewed, nor  presented, three poten-\n\ntial  defense witnesses proposed by  Lema, thereby depriving  him of a\n\n\"viable defense,\" see United States v.

The  district court  summarily\n\ndismissed the claim, apparently on the ground that Lema's section 2255\n\nmotion failed conclusively to \"overcome the presumption that . . . the\n\nchallenged  action  'might  be  considered  sound  trial   strategy.'\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689.  We agree.\n          \n\n    The  decision  whether to  call  a  particular  witness is  almost\n\nalways strategic, requiring a  balancing of the benefits and  risks of\n\nthe  anticipated testimony.  The witness may not testify as anticipat-\n\ned, see Porter, 924 F.2d at  397, or the witness's demeanor or charac-\n              \n\nter  may impress the jury unfavorably and taint the jury's perceptions\n\nof  the accused;  or  the testimony,  though  sympathetic, may  prompt\n\njurors  to draw  inferences  unfavorable to  the  accused, see,  e.g.,\n                                                                     \n\nUnited  States v.

Lema's  affidavit, attached to\nand referenced in the  section 2255 motion, made clear  the identities\n                 \nof the witnesses and the nature of their anticipated testimony.

The government's  case was relatively weak,  based\n\nlargely  on  the testimony  of two  witnesses,  one a  paid informant.\n\nReasonably competent trial counsel might well have determined that the\n\nbest  prospect  for acquittal  lay  in  discrediting the  government's\n\nwitnesses,  rather than  presenting  additional testimony  which could\n\nappear to legitimate  the government's case  or raise questions  about\n\nthe  defense not  previously suggested  by the  government's evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the availability of the putative testimony was problemat-\n\n                                  13\n\nic at best.7  Finally, Pomeroy was  well aware of the risks in calling\n\nSouza,  even assuming  he  was available  to  testify:   Lema  himself\n\nmentioned to Pomeroy  that, just prior to  starting out with  Souza on\n\nthe January drug transaction, Lema had said to Souza \"I  don't want to\n\nbe involved.\"  Had Souza testified to this admission, it clearly would\n\nhave invited the reasonable inference that Lema knew in advance of the\n\nillegal purpose of the January transaction.8\n\n                    \n\n7Lema presented no  affidavit from  Souza, and  no credible  evidence,\nthat Souza's  testimony would  have been available.   At  the time  of\nLema's trial, Souza  was awaiting sentencing; he therefore  retained a\nvalid Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

R.  Evid. 801, absent the  testimony of Souza, whose  \"avail-\n   \nability\" was entirely conjectural.  See supra note 6. \n                                             \n    The testimony  of  the third  individual, Lyons,  was tenuous  and\ncollateral,  and would  not have  absolved Lema.   Lema  contends that\nLyons would have testified that she declined an invitation to accompa-\nny Souza  to Maine just before the January transaction.  We are unable\nto discern  any  relevance in  this testimony.   However,  if it  were\nadmissible, and the jury were to infer that Lyons had  refused because\nshe  knew in advance of  Souza's illegal purpose,  the testimony might\nhave tended to undercut Lema's claim of ignorance as well.\n\n                                  14\n\n    Lema argues  that these strategic  considerations are entitled  to\n\nlittle or no deference, since Pomeroy not only neglected to call these\n\nwitnesses but  failed to investigate  their potential testimony.

A government agent (Bansmer)  testified\n\nthat Lema said nothing during the second (January) drug exchange:  but\n\nHood, the informant, testified  that Lema said to Souza, \"let's do the\n\ndeal  and get  going,\" perhaps  implying knowledge  of the  purpose of\n\nSouza's  trip.   Lema now  asserts that Pomeroy  should have  used the\n\ngovernment's  tape recordings of the  incident (which did  not pick up\n\nLema's  voice)  to impeach  Hood's testimony.   Indeed,  Lema charges,\n\nPomeroy did  not even attempt to obtain the tapes to learn what was on\n\nthem.\n\n    The district court found that Pomeroy's cross-examination of  Hood\n\nshowed that Pomeroy was aware  of the contents of the tapes,  and that\n\nthe  decision not to play  the tapes at  trial was a  matter of \"trial\n\nstrategy\":\n\n    The  record reveals  that Lema's  defense counsel  engaged in\n    extensive cross-examination  about the existence  of tapes of\n    the . . . transactions and attempted to establish \"that there\n    were no recordings that  backed up the testimony of  the gov-\n    ernment's witnesses.\"  Lema, 909 F.2d  at 567.

The factual finding that Pomeroy had access to the tapes\n\n                                  17\n\nwas not clearly  erroneous, and  our own reading  of Pomeroy's  cross-\n\nexamination of Hood accords with the district court's understanding.9\n\n    While these trial tactics may appear  dubious to the petitioner in\n\nhindsight,  especially  in  the  grim reflection  of  the  intervening\n\nconvictions, the  reviewing court  must be  persuaded that  the failed\n\ntrial  strategy was not within  the \"wide range  of reasonable profes-\n\nsional  assistance\" contemplated by Strickland.   We are not persuaded\n                                              \n\nthat the failure to introduce the tapes was beyond Strickland's pale.\n                                                             \n\n    4.Other Claims.\n                  \n\n    The two remaining  claims emphasized in Lema's supplemental pro se\n                                                                      \n\nbrief  are without merit.   First, Lema alleges  that the prosecutor's\n\nclosing  argument included an  indirect comment  on Lema's  failure to\n\ntestify.  Although  Lema states  a cognizable claim  under Griffin  v.\n                                                                  \n\nCalifornia, 380 U.S. 609,  614 (1965) (prosecutor's comment  on defen-\n          \n\ndant's  failure  to  testify  violates Fifth  Amendment),  our  review\n\nconvinces  us  that the  claim  is  unsubstantiated.   The  transcript\n\nreveals that the  prosecutor's comments were  not addressed to  Lema's\n\n                    \n\n9Lema asserts that  Pomeroy was  \"surprised\" at trial  when Hood  (the\ngovernment's first witness) stated that he had worn a recording device\nduring  the January transaction.  Fairly read, however, we believe the\ntranscript is  ambiguous:   it appears  that Pomeroy  either misunder-\nstood, or failed  to recall, Hood's earlier testimony  that he had not\nworn  a recorder  during a  different meeting  with Souza.   Moreover,\n                                     \ndocumentary  evidence confirms  that Pomeroy  had access to  the tapes\nprior  to trial.   Pomeroy wrote to  the prosecutor on  March 8, 1989,\nexpressing  his understanding that \"you will have  copies of the . . .\naudio  recordings for our review  sometime next week,\"  and, when Lema\nreceived Pomeroy's files in  fall 1989, the files contained  a partial\ntranscript of the tapes.\n\n                                  18\n\nsilence  at trial,  but  merely pointed  out,  as evidence  of  Lema's\n                 \n\ncomplicity,  that Lema was present and remained silent while both drug\n\ntransactions were carried  out by Souza.  Such evidence is both admis-\n\nsible and potentially probative.  See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d\n                                                            \n\n707, 714 (1st Cir. 1992) (defendant's silent presence at drug transac-\n\ntion \"patently implied  participation\" where surrounding circumstances\n\nindicated  knowledge thereof).

Lema  argues that only four\n\nkilograms of cocaine  changed hands  while he was  present; the  other\n\n                    \n\n10United  States v.

The court  found that  the prosecutor's  references were\n\"manifestly intended\" to call attention to  the defendant's failure to\ntestify.  Id.  at 188.  In Lema's case,  by contrast, the prosecutor's\n             \nreference to  Lema's silence  plainly called attention  to the  defen-\ndant's silence at the scene of the crime.\n                                        \n\n                                  19\n\nseven kilograms were part of a deal negotiated by Souza outside Lema's\n                                                       \n\npresence, and,  in any event, only four  of these seven kilograms were\n\never accounted for by the police.  The claim is baseless.\n\n    The evidence adduced at trial and  at sentencing    including  the\n\nfact that Lema was with  Souza at the scene of both  cocaine exchanges\n\n   would have  supported a  reasonable inference that  Lema and  Souza\n\nwere   coconspirators,  chargeable  with  all  intended  distributions\n                                             \n\nnegotiated by either conspirator.

The first brace of\n\ncounts charged that on December 15, 1988, Lema aided and abetted Souza\n\nin the sale of one kilogram of cocaine to Hood [the \"December transac-\n\ntion\"].  The second brace of counts charged that on  January 25, 1989,\n\nLema,  Souza, and  a third  man, Alberto  Monsalve-Zapata, sold  three\n\nkilograms of  cocaine to Hood  and another  undercover agent,  Michael\n\nBansmer, as  part of  a ten-kilogram  transaction negotiated by  Souza\n\n[the  \"January transaction\"].   The government  does not  dispute that\n\nSouza  took the most active  role in arranging  and consummating these\n\ntransactions; however, it suggests that Lema's culpability was reason-\n\nably inferable from his presence, with Souza, throughout both transac-\n\ntions,  and from certain telltale  statements made in  the presence of\n\nundercover officers,  indicating Lema's  knowing participation in  the\n\ndistribution scheme.2\n\n    Lema pleaded not guilty  to all charges.   Prior to trial, he dis-\n\ncharged  his  court-appointed  counsel  and  retained  David  Pomeroy,\n\nEsquire.   Lema  met  with  Pomeroy several  times,  and  emphatically\n\nexpressed his desire to testify  at trial.3  In furtherance of  Lema's\n\nstated desire to testify, Pomeroy filed a motion in limine to preclude\n\ncross-examination about  Lema's prior  criminal conviction for  inter-\n\nstate transportation of  stolen property.   The motion  was denied  on\n\nAugust 7, 1991.\n\n    Trial began the  next day.  At  trial, the defense contended  that\n\nthough Lema  may have been at  the scene of the  drug transactions, he\n\nneither actively participated in, nor was he aware of, Souza's cocaine\n\ndealings  on those occasions.  The government's case was based largely\n\non the testimony of Hood and Bansmer, who testified to Lema's presence\n\nat the  scene of the drug  exchanges.  The purport  of their testimony\n\nwas that it would have been  virtually impossible for Lema not to have\n\nknown that Souza was conducting drug  transactions on those occasions.\n\nAt the close of the government's case, Lema conferred with Pomeroy and\n\n                    \n\n2For a fuller description of Lema's involvement in these transactions,\nand his subsequent trial, see United States v.

See\n                                                                      \ninfra at pp. 12-17. \n     \n\n                                  3\n\nagain expressed his desire  to testify.  Pomeroy no  less emphatically\n\nadvised Lema  that the government's case was weak and that    in light\n\nof the denial of the motion in limine    Lema's testimony would expose\n\nhim to  cross-examination concerning his prior  conviction, would lose\n\nthe sympathy  of the jury, and therefore would be unwise.  An argument\n\nensued,  witnessed  by  courtroom  observers; Lema  did  not  testify.\n\nPomeroy  then recalled one  witness, a DEA agent  who had attempted to\n\nrecord the  December  drug transaction  but failed  to capture  Lema's\n\nvoice on tape.  The defense rested.\n\n    At closing  argument, the prosecutor  acknowledged that Lema  said\n\nlittle during the course of  the two drug transactions, but  urged the\n\njury  to infer Lema's knowledge  of Souza's drug  dealings, and Lema's\n\nintent to participate in  the drug distribution scheme, from  the fact\n\nthat  Lema had been present  and remained silent  during both transac-\n\ntions.  Lema was convicted on all counts.\n\n    Thereafter, Lema, acting pro se, moved  for a new trial,  accusing\n                                   \n\nPomeroy of ineffective assistance.   At Lema's request, Pomeroy  with-\n\ndrew,  and successor counsel was  appointed to represent  Lema at sen-\n\ntencing.   The district court dismissed Lema's motion for new trial as\n\nuntimely.   The  court sentenced  Lema to  135 months  in prison.   We\n\naffirmed Lema's conviction on direct appeal.  See note 1 supra.\n                                                              \n\n    Undaunted,  Lema moved  for  vacation  of sentence  and new  trial\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.   The district court summarily denied  four of\n\nLema's habeas claims but reserved judgment on the fifth, which alleged\n\nthat  Pomeroy prevented  him from  testifying.   After  an evidentiary\n\n                                  4\n\nhearing,  a  magistrate-judge recommended  denial  of the  ineffective\n\nassistance claim.   The  district court thereupon  denied the  section\n\n2255 petition in its entirety.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n    This appeal has two  parts:  a  formal appeal, filed by  appellate\n\ncounsel,  asserting ineffective  assistance  by trial  counsel; and  a\n\nsupplemental pro se brief,  raising claims of prosecutorial misconduct\n                   \n\nand sentencing error.

Moreover,\n                                     \ndocumentary  evidence confirms  that Pomeroy  had access to  the tapes\nprior  to trial.
