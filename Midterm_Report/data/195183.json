Plaintiff-appellant  Theresa\n          Cyr,  Circuit   Judge.\n                               \n\nPhinney  was struck  and  injured  by a  backhoe  operated by  an\n\nemployee of  Middlesex  Corporation,  an  independent  contractor\n\nengaged  by the  United States  to resurface  roads at  Pease Air\n\nForce Base  in New  Hampshire.   After exhausting  administrative\n\nremedies, see  28 U.S.C.    2675, plaintiff brought  this Federal\n             \n\nTort  Claims  Act [FTCA]  suit,  alleging, inter  alia,  that the\n                                                      \n\nUnited  States breached  a nondelegable  duty of  care under  New\n\nHampshire law  by allowing its  contractor to  operate a  backhoe\n\nwith an  inoperative safety alarm.   The United States  moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the grounds  that it has not waived sovereign\n\nimmunity  from suit  for the  torts of  its contractors,  see id.\n                                                                 \n\n  2671; United States  v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392,  399 (1976), and,\n                                \n\nin  any event, that the \"discretionary function exception\" to the\n\nFTCA, see id.   2680(a), shields it from any such liability.  The\n             \n\ndistrict  court dismissed on  the sovereign immunity  ground, and\n\nPhinney appealed.   We now affirm, substantially  for the reasons\n\nstated in the unpublished district court opinion.  See Phinney v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States, No. 90-467-JD, slip op. (D. N.H. July 12, 1993).  \n             \n\n          Although  appellant  concedes   that  Middlesex  was  a\n\n\"contractor,\" within  the meaning of 28 U.S.C.   2671, see United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Orleans,  425 U.S. 807,  814-15 (1976), she  challenges\n                 \n\nthe  district court  ruling, under  New  Hampshire law,  that the\n\n                                2\n\nactivity  Middlesex contracted to  perform for the  United States\n\nwas not inherently dangerous. \n\n          The district court relied primarily on Wilson v. Nooter\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 499  F.2d 705 (1st Cir. 1974), where  we held, as a matter\n     \n\nof law, that the defendant  was not liable to the  injured plain-\n\ntiff  under the \"inherent danger\"  exception to the New Hampshire\n\nindependent contractor rule because:  \n\n          the lateral  movement of the  boom . . .  was\n          not a  necessary or  anticipated part  of the\n          project.   It could,  and  should, have  been\n                 \n          prevented by setting the proper switch in the\n          crane.  [The plaintiff]  did not allege,  and\n          the evidence does not show, that  [the defen-\n          dant] knew or  should have known at  the time\n                                                       \n          it engaged the Ferguson crane that the crane-\n                                       \n          's operators would fail to set that switch.\n\nId. at 708  (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).   Similarly, the\n   \n\ndistrict court in  this case ruled that the  United States, \"when\n\nit contracted  with Middlesex, had  no reason to suspect  or know\n\nthat  Middlesex would allow  its employees to  work with malfunc-\n\ntioning equipment.\"  Phinney, slip  op. at 8-9.  Consequently, as\n                            \n\nwe explained  in Wilson, 499  F.2d at 708, the  \"inherent danger\"\n                       \n\nexception is unavailing  to appellant because it was  not \"'natu-\n\nrally to be  apprehended'\" by the United  States, at the time  it\n                                                                 \n\ncontracted with  Middlesex, that  a backhoe  with an  inoperative\n                          \n\nalarm system would be used to perform the road surfacing work.\n\n          Appellant counters  that  Carr  v.  Merrimack  Farmer's\n                                                                 \n\nExch., Inc., 146 A.2d 276 (N.H. 1958),  is a case more closely in\n           \n\npoint.   In Carr, a  contractor hired  by the defendant  to truck\n                \n\n                                3\n\nbaled hay piled the bales dangerously high, and  the hay fell and\n\ninjured  the plaintiff.  Id.  at 278.   The New Hampshire Supreme\n                            \n\nCourt first noted  that transporting baled  hay is not  generally\n                                                                 \n\nconsidered \"inherently dangerous.\"   Id. at 279.   The court went\n                                        \n\non to  hold, however, that  since the plaintiff had  alleged that\n\nthe  defendant knew  or should  have  known that  the bales  were\n                                                                 \n\nstacked too high, the trucking\n                \n\n          could . . . reasonably be found to present an\n          unreasonable risk of  injury to the traveling\n          public of such magnitude  that the defendant,\n          assuming  its  knowledge of  the facts  or of\n                                                       \n          circumstances  charging it  with such  knowl-\n                                                       \n          edge, could reasonably be found under  a duty\n              \n          to avoid it.\n\nId. (emphasis  added).   Appellant  insists that  her proffer    \n   \n\nthat the United States had actual knowledge of the malfunctioning\n\nalarm system  on the backhoe     was  enough to fend  off summary\n\njudgment, see Carr, 146 A.2d at 280.\n                  \n\n          Appellant  correctly notes that the court must consider\n\nthe  circumstances in  each  case  in  ascertaining  whether  the\n\nactivity to be performed under the contract is inherently danger-\n\nous.  See Wilson, 499 F.2d at 707 n.4 (test is an objective one).\n                \n\nThe  critical considerations for present purposes are whether the\n\nUnited  States reasonably  should  have  known,  at the  time  it\n                                                                 \n\ncontracted with Middlesex, that either the inherent nature of the\n                         \n\nwork itself, see  Wilson, 499 F.2d at 708, or the manner in which\n                        \n\nit  would be performed by  the contractor, see  Carr, 146 A.2d at\n                                                    \n\n279, made  it unreasonably dangerous  so as to render  the United\n\n                                4\n\nStates'  duty of care  nondelegable.  Other  New Hampshire cases,\n\nincluding  Carr, as  well as  the Restatement  (Second) of  Torts\n               \n\n  416 cmt.  a, corroborate  the Wilson  rationale, and  appellant\n                                      \n\npoints to no  contrary New Hampshire authority.1   Thus, although\n\nappellant  proffered  that  the  backhoe  operator   (appellant's\n\nhusband) had  informed a  representative of  the Pease Air  Force\n\nBase  Civil Engineering Department, before the accident, that the\n                                                       \n\nbackhoe  alarm worked only intermittently, there is no intimation\n\nthat this  information had been  acquired by the time  the United\n\nStates entered into the road surfacing contract with Middlesex.\n\n          Finally, appellant argues that the contract requirement\n\nthat  the  backhoe be  equipped  with an  operative  safety alarm\n\n\"compels the conclusion that it recognized that such equipment is\n\n                    \n\n     1As  Carr, 146 A.2d at 276,  arose on motion to dismiss, the\n              \ncourt was  compelled to  assume that the  defendant knew,  at the\ntime  the contract  was made,  that  the bales  had been  stacked\ndangerously high.  Thus, Carr is not  in point.  Further, in Lane\n                                                                 \nv. Groetz, 230 A.2d 741 (N.H.  1967), decided after Carr, the New\n                                                        \nHampshire Supreme Court held that the \"inherent danger\" exception\ndid not apply  where the plaintiff's  decedent fell on a  path in\nthe snow  shoveled by the  defendant's contractor, since  \"it was\nnot  a 'necessary  and anticipated  part of  the work'  which the\n[defendant] sought to  have done, that the path  should cross the\nstreet drain, and this consequence of causing the path to be made\nwas  not 'naturally to be apprehended'  in advance.\"  Id. at 744,\n                                                         \nciting Thomas  v. Harrington,  54  A. 285  (N.H. 1903)  (emphasis\n                            \nadded); see  Carr, 146 A.2d  at 279.  Similarly,  the Restatement\n                 \n(Second) of Torts  states that:  \"[the  inherent danger exception\nis  a form  of the  rule that]  the employer  remains liable  for\ninjuries  resulting from dangers  which he should  contemplate at\n                                                                 \nthe time that  he enters into  the contract, and cannot  shift to\n                                           \nthe contractor the responsibility for such dangers, or for taking\nprecautions  against them.\"   Restatement  (Second)  of Torts  at\n  416 cmt. a (emphasis added).  \n\n                                5\n\ninherently dangerous.\"  On the contrary, these contractual safety\n\nprecautions  clearly cut  against  the  application  of  the  New\n\nHampshire \"inherent danger\" exception in these circumstances.  In\n\nCarr,  the New  Hampshire  Supreme Court  adverted  to just  such\n    \n\ncontractual precautions:\n\n          One who employs an  independent contractor to\n          do work  which the employer  should recognize\n          as necessarily creating, during its progress,\n          conditions containing an unreasonable risk of\n          bodily harm to others unless special  precau-\n                                                       \n          tions are taken, is  subject to liability for\n               \n          bodily  harm caused by them by the absence of\n          such precautions,  if the employer  (a) fails\n          to provide  in the contract that the contrac-\n                                                       \n          tor should take such precautions . . . or (b)\n                                          \n          fails to exercise reasonable care to  provide\n          in some other  manner for the taking  of such\n          precautions.\n\n146 A.2d at 278  (quoting Restatement of the Law:   Torts,   413)\n\n(emphasis added).  Thus, assuming arguendo that there  was reason\n                                          \n\nto  believe,  at the  time  the  United  States  contracted  with\n\nMiddlesex, that  it  would be  unreasonably  dangerous to  use  a\n\nbackhoe without an operative alarm system to perform the required\n\nroad surfacing work, there is nothing to indicate that the United\n\nStates failed  \"to provide  in the contract  that the  contractor\n\nshould take [special]  precautions\" as contemplated in  Carr, 146\n                                                            \n\nA.2d at 278. \n\n          The \"inherent danger\" determination respecting a parti-\n\ncular  activity turns on  whether its proper  performance entails\n               \n\nundue risk to others, see Wilson, 499  F.2d at 708 (danger \"not a\n                                \n\nnecessary or anticipated part of the project\").

See id.; Lane,\n                                                                \n\n230  A.2d at  744; Restatement  (Second)  of Torts    427 cmt.  d\n\n(\"inherent  danger\"  exception  \"has  no  application  where  the\n\nnegligence of the contractor creates  a new risk, not inherent in\n\nthe work itself or in the ordinary or prescribed way of doing it,\n                                                \n\nand not reasonably to be contemplated by the employer\") (emphasis\n\nadded).  As appellant failed  to demonstrate that this case comes\n\nwithin either version of  the \"inherent danger\" exception  to the\n\nNew Hampshire independent  contractor rule, see Wilson,  499 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 708; Carr, 146 A.2d at 276, summary judgment was proper.2\n            \n\n          Since  the United States  has not waived  its sovereign\n\nimmunity from suit for the  torts of its independent contractors,\n\nand  Phinney failed  to  demonstrate a  trialworthy  issue as  to\n\nwhether  the United States  owed her an  independent nondelegable\n\nduty  under New  Hampshire  law,  the  district  court  correctly\n\ndismissed the  FTCA action for  lack of subject  matter jurisdic-\n\ntion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     2Therefore,  we take no view of the \"discretionary function\"\nargument advanced by  the government or of the related discussion\nin  Clark v.

After exhausting administrative remedies, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2675, plaintiff brought this Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA] suit, alleging, inter alia, that the United States breached a non-delegable duty of care under New Hampshire law by allowing its contractor to operate a backhoe with an inoperative safety alarm.  The United States moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it has not waived sovereign immunity from suit for the torts of its contractors, see id. Sec. 2671;  United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), and, in any event, that the \"discretionary function\" exception to the FTCA, see id. Sec. 2680(a), shields it from any such liability.  The district court dismissed on the sovereign immunity ground, and Phinney appealed.  We now affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the unpublished district court opinion.  See Phinney v. United States, No. 90-467-JD, slip op., 1993 WL 594344 (D.N.H. July 12, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant concedes that Middlesex was a \"contractor,\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2671, see United States v. Orleans, 425 U.S. 807, 814-15, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 1976, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976), she challenges the district court ruling, under New Hampshire law, that the activity Middlesex contracted to perform for the United States was not inherently dangerous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied primarily on Wilson v. Nooter Corp., 499 F.2d 705 (1st Cir.1974), where we held, as a matter of law, that the defendant was not liable to the injured plaintiff under the \"inherent danger\" exception to the New Hampshire independent contractor rule because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>the lateral movement of the boom ... was not a necessary or anticipated part of the project.   It could, and should, have been prevented by setting the proper switch in the crane.  [The plaintiff] did not allege, and the evidence does not show, that [the defendant] knew or should have known at the time it engaged the Ferguson crane that the crane's operators would fail to set that switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 708 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).  Similarly, the district court in this case ruled that the United States, \"when it contracted with Middlesex, had no reason to suspect or know that Middlesex would allow its employees to work with malfunctioning equipment.\"  Phinney, slip op. at 8-9.  Consequently, as we explained in Wilson, 499 F.2d at 708, the \"inherent danger\" exception is unavailing to appellant because it was not \" 'naturally to be apprehended' \" by the United States, at the time it contracted with Middlesex, that a backhoe with an inoperative alarm system would be used to perform the road surfacing work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant counters that Carr v. Merrimack Farmer's Exch., Inc., 101 N.H. 445, 146 A.2d 276 (1958), is a case more closely in point.  In Carr, a contractor hired by the defendant to truck baled hay piled the bales dangerously high, and the hay fell and injured the plaintiff.  Id. 146 A.2d at 278.   The New Hampshire Supreme Court first noted that transporting baled hay is not generally considered \"inherently dangerous.\"  Id. 146 A.2d at 279.   The court went on to hold, however, that since the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant knew or should have known that the bales were stacked too high, the trucking</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>could ... reasonably be found to present an unreasonable risk of injury to the traveling public of such magnitude that the defendant, assuming its knowledge of the facts or of circumstances charging it with such knowledge, could reasonably be found under a duty to avoid it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).  Appellant insists that her proffer--that the United States had actual knowledge of the malfunctioning alarm system on the backhoe--was enough to fend off summary judgment, see Carr, 146 A.2d at 280.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant correctly notes that the court must consider the circumstances in each case in ascertaining whether the activity to be performed under the contract is inherently dangerous.  See Wilson, 499 F.2d at 707 n. 4 (test is an objective one).  The critical considerations for present purposes are whether the United States reasonably should have known, at the time it contracted with Middlesex, that either the inherent nature of the work itself, see Wilson, 499 F.2d at 708, or the manner in which it would be performed by the contractor, see Carr, 146 A.2d at 279, made it unreasonably dangerous so as to render the United States' duty of care nondelegable.  Other New Hampshire cases, including Carr, as well as the Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 416 cmt. a, corroborate the Wilson rationale, and appellant points to no contrary New Hampshire authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Thus, although appellant proffered that the backhoe operator (appellant's husband) had informed a representative of the Pease Air Force Base Civil Engineering Department, before the accident, that the backhoe alarm worked only intermittently, there is no intimation that this information had been acquired by the time the United States entered into the road surfacing contract with Middlesex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant argues that the contract requirement that the backhoe be equipped with an operative safety alarm \"compels the conclusion that it recognized that such equipment is inherently dangerous.\"   On the contrary, these contractual safety precautions clearly cut against the application of the New Hampshire \"inherent danger\" exception in these circumstances.  In Carr, the New Hampshire Supreme Court adverted to just such contractual precautions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>One who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as necessarily creating, during its progress, conditions containing an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for bodily harm caused by them by the absence of such precautions, if the employer (a) fails to provide in the contract that the contractor should take such precautions ... or (b) fails to exercise reasonable care to provide in some other manner for the taking of such precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">146 A.2d at 278 (quoting Restatement of the Law:  Torts, Sec. 413) (emphasis added).  Thus, assuming arguendo that there was reason to believe, at the time the United States contracted with Middlesex, that it would be unreasonably dangerous to use a backhoe without an operative alarm system to perform the required road surfacing work, there is nothing to indicate that the United States failed \"to provide in the contract that the contractor should take [special] precautions\" as contemplated in Carr, 146 A.2d at 278.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"inherent danger\" determination respecting a particular activity turns on whether its proper performance entails undue risk to others, see Wilson, 499 F.2d at 708 (danger \"not a necessary or anticipated part of the project \").  The possibility that an employee might perform the work in a negligent fashion does not make the activity inherently dangerous.  See id.;  Lane, 230 A.2d at 744;  Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 427 cmt. d (\"inherent danger\" exception \"has no application where the negligence of the contractor creates a new risk, not inherent in the work itself or in the ordinary or prescribed way of doing it, and not reasonably to be contemplated by the employer\") (emphasis added).  As appellant failed to demonstrate that this case comes within either version of the \"inherent danger\" exception to the New Hampshire independent contractor rule, see Wilson, 499 F.2d at 708;  Carr, 146 A.2d at 276, summary judgment was proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity from suit for the torts of its independent contractors, and Phinney failed to demonstrate a trialworthy issue as to whether the United States owed her an independent nondelegable duty under New Hampshire law, the district court correctly dismissed the FTCA action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As Carr, 146 A.2d at 276, arose on motion to dismiss, the court was compelled to assume that the defendant knew, at the time the contract was made, that the bales had been stacked dangerously high.  Thus, Carr is not in point.  Further, in Lane v. Groetz, 108 N.H. 173, 230 A.2d 741 (1967), decided after Carr, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the \"inherent danger\" exception did not apply where the plaintiff's decedent fell on a path in the snow shoveled by the defendant's contractor, since \"it was not a 'necessary and anticipated part of the work' which the [defendant] sought to have done, that the path should cross the street drain, and this consequence of causing the path to be made was not 'naturally to be apprehended' in advance.\"  Id. 230 A.2d at 744, citing Thomas v. Harrington, 72 N.H. 45, 54 A. 285 (1903) (emphasis added);  see Carr, 146 A.2d at 279.   Similarly, the Restatement (Second) of Torts states that:  \"[the inherent danger exception is a form of the rule that] the employer remains liable for injuries resulting from dangers which he should contemplate at the time that he enters into the contract, and cannot shift to the contractor the responsibility for such dangers, or for taking precautions against them.\"   Restatement (Second) of Torts at Sec. 416 cmt. a (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Therefore, we take no view of the \"discretionary function\" argument advanced by the government or of the related discussion in Clark v.
