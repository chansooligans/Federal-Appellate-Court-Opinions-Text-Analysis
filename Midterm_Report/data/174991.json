Julia Vanchurina, a native and\n\ncitizen of Russia, and her husband Svetomir Radisavlevic, a native\n\nof Yugoslavia and citizen of Serbia, seek review of a final order\n\nof removal of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").                         The BIA\n\nupheld an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of Vanchurina's request\n\nfor       asylum,      of   which   Radisavlevic         would     be    a   derivative\n\nbeneficiary, and Vanchurina's request for withholding of removal.\n\nWe deny their petition.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                 Vanchurina and Radisavlevic entered the United States on\n\nMay 17, 2006, as non-immigrant visitors.                       On October 30, 2006,\n\nprior      to    the   expiration    of    their      visas,    Vanchurina     filed   an\n\naffirmative asylum application with the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity on the basis of past persecution, with Radisavlevic listed\n\nas    a    derivative       beneficiary.         An   asylum     officer     found   that\n\nVanchurina failed to establish that she was a refugee and referred\n\nthe       case   to    an   IJ.     On    February      5,     2007,    Vanchurina     and\n\nRadisavlevic were served with a Notice to Appear charging each of\n\nthem with removability, which they conceded.\n\n                 On June 5, 2008, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic testified\n\nbefore an IJ at a hearing on Vanchurina's petition for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.              As a spouse cannot be a derivative\n\nbeneficiary of withholding of removal, and                      Radisavlevic did not\n\nfile an independent application, the only relief he requested was\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fasylum.   Neither petitioner requested relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.\n\n            We briefly summarize their testimony, which the IJ found\n\ncredible.\n\n            In 1998, Vanchurina started a small internet business in\n\nMoscow.   The company was successful, with revenues of $10,000 per\n\nmonth, and governmental monitoring organizations--the Internal\n\nRevenue Service and Ministry of Communications--soon began to make\n\nweekly \"inspections\" of her business premises.           She started to\n\nreceive phone calls stating that she needed to pay a price to stop\n\nthe inspections, but she refused to pay and told the police about\n\nthe incidents.    Although the police refused to take a report, they\n\ntold her that if anyone threatened her life, they would intervene.\n\n            At   approximately   the    same   time,   Radisavlevic   was\n\nsubjected to separate economic coercion.         He was the head of a\n\nconstruction crew building a hotel in Russia, and when he sought\n\npayment of $20,000 for work that his crew had done, he was forced,\n\nat gunpoint, to sign a promissory note to instead pay this sum to\n\nthe company.     He went to the police but they refused to take a\n\nreport, so Vanchurina and Radisavlevic paid the sum in $1,000\n\nmonthly installments, at one point under threat that their visiting\n\ngrandson would be taken if they did not pay.\n\n            In November of 2000, Vanchurina's place of business was\n\nraided by the police, who seized her office equipment and called\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fher in for questioning.         The police told her that they would plant\n\nnarcotics and weapons in her office if she did not pay them $2,000\n\nper month.     When she refused, she was subjected to questioning\n\nevery morning for five days in a row, which ended only when she\n\nthreatened     to    have   her      son   file     suit   against    them   in   an\n\ninternational court.           The phone calls then stopped, but only\n\ntemporarily, and at the end of 2001, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic\n\nreceived a phone call threatening to kidnap their grandson.\n\n          In        response    to     these       threats,   which     Vanchurina\n\ncharacterized as \"scary,\" she sold her internet business for\n\n$20,000--one fifth of the value that she estimates it was worth--\n\nand moved to the suburbs of Moscow, where she and Radisavlevic\n\nbegan construction on a house.                   Soon thereafter, local police\n\ncommenced frequent inspections of the house, and Vanchurina was\n\ntold that she needed to pay them $500 per month for protection from\n\nfurther inspections and coercion.                 After she refused to pay, a\n\ncontainer of waste was set on fire close to their house on three\n\noccasions; each occasion was followed by a phone call asking\n\nwhether she was frightened and whether she realized that she needed\n\nto pay for protection.         During the winter of 2005, the electricity\n\nand gas service to their house was cut several times; Vanchurina\n\nattributed this to the extortion attempts, but did not provide\n\nevidence that the cuts were intentional.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f          Vanchurina and Radisavlevic did not attempt to avoid the\n\nthreats by changing phone numbers or leaving the Moscow area.\n\nVanchurina explained that the reason they refused to pay on the\n\nthreats to their house was that she did not want to \"play along\"\n\nwith the corrupt system--that doing so was against her conscience\n\nand Christian beliefs.    In 2006, they moved to the United States to\n\nescape the threats and demands.          Vanchurina believes that the\n\nthreats and demands will resume if they return to Russia and that\n\nthe only way to avoid them would be to \"give everything away and be\n\n. . . poor.\"\n\n          In an oral decision dated June 5, 2008, the IJ found\n\ntheir testimony credible, but denied Vanchurina's petition for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal, concluding that Vanchurina and\n\nRadisavlevic \"were subjected to extortion and it was no doubt an\n\nunpleasant     and   frightening   experience,   but   the   experiences\n\ndescribed . . . do not rise to the level of persecution.\"        The IJ\n\nfurther held that even if this extortion constituted persecution,\n\n\"the basis for the victimization . . . was economic and at no point\n\ndoes the evidence reveal that respondents were victimized on\n\naccount of one of the five protected areas.\"             See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A). Finding Vanchurina ineligible for asylum, the IJ\n\nfound that she could not meet the more stringent standard for\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f               The    BIA     affirmed    the    IJ's    denial    of    Vanchurina's\n\napplication for asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds\n\nthat \"the nature and context of the respondents' claim--one that\n\nentails criminal extortion and threats--does not implicate an\n\nenumerated protected ground.\"               The BIA found that because the\n\nrespondents did not qualify for asylum, they failed to meet the\n\nhigher burden for withholding of removal.\n\n                                           II.\n\n               No pure question of law is presented by this petition.\n\nWe   review     the    BIA's    findings    under       the   substantial     evidence\n\nstandard.       Matovu v. Holder, 577 F.3d 383, 386 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\"Under this deferential standard, we accept these findings so long\n\nas they are grounded in reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole,\" id. (quoting Sharari\n\nv. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted), and grant a petition only \"if the record compels a\n\nconclusion contrary to that reached by the agency,\" Lopez Perez v.\n\nHolder, 587 F.3d 456, 460 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n               An     applicant     for     asylum       must     demonstrate    past\n\npersecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, on\n\ngrounds of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"                 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nA    showing     of    past     persecution      gives    rise    to    a   rebuttable\n\npresumption of future persecution.               Anacassus v. Holder, 602 F.3d\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f14, 19 (1st Cir. 2010).       Otherwise, a petitioner must provide\n\n\"specific proof\" that his or her fear of future persecution \"is\n\nboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\"      Decky v.\n\nHolder, 587 F.3d 104, 110 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Castillo-Diaz v.\n\nHolder, 562 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            An alien's experiences \"must add up to more than ordinary\n\nharassment, mistreatment, or suffering\" to meet the requirement of\n\n\"persecution.\"    Lopez de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 217\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).     Persecution need not be physical, see Un v.\n\nGonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 210 (1st Cir. 2005), but economic extortion\n\ndoes not rise to the level of economic persecution unless it\n\ninvolves the \"deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage\n\nor the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment, or other\n\nessentials of life,\" Kadri v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting In re T-Z, 24 I & N. Dec. 163, 171 (BIA 2007))\n\n(internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n            Substantial evidence supports the BIA's finding that \"the\n\nnature and context of the respondents' claim--one that entails\n\ncriminal extortion and threats\"--did not establish grounds for\n\nasylum.   The fact that the police threatened to plant narcotics or\n\nweapons in Vanchurina's office if she did not pay them was a threat\n\nand did not itself cause a deprivation of liberty.     Likewise, the\n\nweekly governmental \"inspections\" of Vanchurina's business and the\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fburning of trash near her house did not deprive her of housing or\n\nemployment.     She did sell her business, Moscow apartment, and\n\ncountry house to escape from these threats, but she was not coerced\n\nto do so; in fact, this result was contrary to the wishes of those\n\nmaking the threats, who wanted money. Of the numerous threats that\n\nVanchurina and Radisavlevic received, they paid money in response\n\nto one--the 1998 threat to Radisavlevic at work--and failed to\n\nspecify   how     these    payments     imposed    a     \"severe   economic\n\ndisadvantage.\"     On the contrary, they testified to facts--such as\n\ntheir construction of a \"large house\" in a \"nice neighborhood\" in\n\nthe Moscow suburbs--that could lead the BIA reasonably to conclude\n\notherwise.\n\n             Substantial   evidence    also   supports   the   finding   that\n\nVanchurina was not subjected to extortion on account of a protected\n\nground. Vanchurina contends that \"small business owners\" should be\n\ntreated as    a \"social group\" under the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct on the grounds that the group has particular and well-defined\n\nboundaries that would be generally recognized by others in the\n\ncommunity.    However, in evaluating claims for asylum on grounds of\n\nmembership in a social group, \"the key is whether the claimed\n\npersecution is aimed at an individual because of his or her\n\naffiliation with a group of persons, all of whom share a common,\n\nimmutable characteristic.\"      Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    The IJ and BIA were not compelled to conclude on these\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ffacts that the individual economic extortion of Vanchurina was on\n\nprotected grounds.     Cf. López-Castro v. Holder, 577 F.3d 49, 54\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (\"A country-wide risk of victimization through\n\neconomic   terrorism     is     not     the    functional    equivalent   of   a\n\nstatutorily   protected       ground,    and    hostile   treatment   based    on\n\neconomic considerations is not persecution.\").\n\n           Furthermore, even if \"small business owners\" were a\n\n\"social group\" within the meaning of the statute, Vanchurina would\n\nneed to establish that she was persecuted \"on account of\" her\n\nmembership in this group.        Vanchurina did not provide any evidence\n\nthat she was being targeted because she was a small business owner,\n\nrather than merely because she had money.                   Because the \"facts\n\ninvite the inference that whoever was threatening the petitioner\n\ntargeted her because of greed, not because of her political opinion\n\nor membership in a particular social group,\" Lopez de Hincapie, 494\n\nF.3d at 219, the BIA did nor err in finding that Vanchurina did not\n\nsatisfy the statutory criteria.\n\n           The petition is denied.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f",

The BIA upheld an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of Vanchurina's request for asylum, of which Radisavlevic would be a derivative beneficiary, and Vanchurina's request for withholding of removal. We deny their petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Vanchurina and Radisavlevic entered the United States on May 17, 2006, as non-immigrant visitors. On October 30, 2006, prior to the expiration of their visas, Vanchurina filed an affirmative asylum application with the Department of Homeland Security on the basis of past persecution, with Radisavlevic listed as a derivative beneficiary. An asylum officer found that Vanchurina failed to establish that she was a refugee and referred the case to an IJ. On February 5, 2007, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic were served with a Notice to Appear charging each of them with removability, which they conceded.</p>\n<p>On June 5, 2008, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic testified before an IJ at a hearing on Vanchurina's petition for asylum and withholding of removal. As a spouse cannot be a derivative beneficiary of withholding of removal, and Radisavlevic did not file an independent application, the only relief he requested was asylum. Neither petitioner requested relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>We briefly summarize their testimony, which the IJ found credible.</p>\n<p>In 1998, Vanchurina started a small internet business in Moscow.

The fact that the police threatened to plant narcotics or weapons in Vanchurina's office if she did not pay them was a threat and did not itself cause a deprivation of liberty. Likewise, the weekly governmental \"inspections\" of Vanchurina's business and the burning of trash near her house did not deprive her of housing or employment. She did sell her business, Moscow apartment, and country house to escape from these threats, but she was not coerced to do so; in fact, this result was contrary to the wishes of those making the threats, who wanted money. Of the numerous threats that Vanchurina and Radisavlevic received, they paid money in response to onethe 1998 threat to Radisavlevic at workand failed to specify how these payments imposed a \"severe economic disadvantage.\" On the contrary, they testified to factssuch as their construction of a \"large house\" in a \"nice neighborhood\" in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> the Moscow suburbsthat could lead the BIA reasonably to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Vanchurina was not subjected to extortion on account of a protected ground. Vanchurina contends that \"small business owners\" should be treated as a \"social group\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act on the grounds that the group has particular and well-defined boundaries that would be generally recognized by others in the community. However, in evaluating claims for asylum on grounds of membership in a social group, \"the key is whether the claimed persecution is aimed at an individual because of his or her affiliation with a group of persons, all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic.\" <i>Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005). The IJ and BIA were not compelled to conclude on these facts that the individual economic extortion of Vanchurina was on protected grounds. <i>Cf. </i><i>López-Castro v. Holder,</i> 577 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2009) (\"A country-wide risk of victimization through economic terrorism is not the functional equivalent of a statutorily protected ground, and hostile treatment based on economic considerations is not persecution.\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if \"small business owners\" were a \"social group\" within the meaning of the statute, Vanchurina would need to establish that she was persecuted \"on account of\" her membership in this group. Vanchurina did not provide any evidence that she was being targeted because she was a small business owner, rather than merely because she had money. Because the \"facts invite the inference that whoever was threatening the petitioner targeted her because of greed, not because of her political opinion or membership in a particular social group,\" <i>Lopez de Hincapie,</i> 494 F.3d at 219, the BIA did nor err in finding that Vanchurina did not satisfy the statutory criteria.</p>\n<p>The petition is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n</div>",

Messuri, Trial Attorney, were on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Julia Vanchurina, a native and citizen of Russia, and her husband Svetomir Radisavlevic, a native of Yugoslavia and citizen of Serbia, seek review of a final order of removal of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). The BIA upheld an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of Vanchurina's request for asylum, of which Radisavlevic would be a derivative beneficiary, and Vanchurina's request for withholding of removal. We deny their petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Vanchurina and Radisavlevic entered the United States on May 17, 2006, as non-immigrant visitors. On October 30, 2006, prior to the expiration of their visas, Vanchurina filed an affirmative asylum application with the Department of Homeland Security on the basis of past persecution, with Radisavlevic listed as a derivative beneficiary. An asylum officer found that Vanchurina failed to establish that she was a refugee and referred the case to an IJ. On February 5, 2007, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic were served with a Notice to Appear charging each of them with removability, which they conceded.</p>\n<p>On June 5, 2008, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic testified before an IJ at a hearing on Vanchurina's petition for asylum and withholding of removal. As a spouse cannot be a derivative beneficiary of withholding of removal, and Radisavlevic did not file an independent application, the only relief he requested was asylum. Neither petitioner requested relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>We briefly summarize their testimony, which the IJ found credible.</p>\n<p>In 1998, Vanchurina started a small internet business in Moscow. The company was successful, with revenues of $10,000 per month, and governmental monitoring organizationsthe Internal Revenue Service and Ministry of Communications soon began to make weekly \"inspections\" of her business premises. She started to receive phone calls stating that she needed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> to pay a price to stop the inspections, but she refused to pay and told the police about the incidents. Although the police refused to take a report, they told her that if anyone threatened her life, they would intervene.</p>\n<p>At approximately the same time, Radisavlevic was subjected to separate economic coercion. He was the head of a construction crew building a hotel in Russia, and when he sought payment of $20,000 for work that his crew had done, he was forced, at gunpoint, to sign a promissory note to instead pay this sum to the company. He went to the police but they refused to take a report, so Vanchurina and Radisavlevic paid the sum in $1,000 monthly installments, at one point under threat that their visiting grandson would be taken if they did not pay.</p>\n<p>In November of 2000, Vanchurina's place of business was raided by the police, who seized her office equipment and called her in for questioning. The police told her that they would plant narcotics and weapons in her office if she did not pay them $2,000 per month. When she refused, she was subjected to questioning every morning for five days in a row, which ended only when she threatened to have her son file suit against them in an international court. The phone calls then stopped, but only temporarily, and at the end of 2001, Vanchurina and Radisavlevic received a phone call threatening to kidnap their grandson.</p>\n<p>In response to these threats, which Vanchurina characterized as \"scary,\" she sold her internet business for $20,000one fifth of the value that she estimates it was worthand moved to the suburbs of Moscow, where she and Radisavlevic began construction on a house. Soon thereafter, local police commenced frequent inspections of the house, and Vanchurina was told that she needed to pay them $500 per month for protection from further inspections and coercion. After she refused to pay, a container of waste was set on fire close to their house on three occasions; each occasion was followed by a phone call asking whether she was frightened and whether she realized that she needed to pay for protection. During the winter of 2005, the electricity and gas service to their house was cut several times; Vanchurina attributed this to the extortion attempts, but did not provide evidence that the cuts were intentional.</p>\n<p>Vanchurina and Radisavlevic did not attempt to avoid the threats by changing phone numbers or leaving the Moscow area. Vanchurina explained that the reason they refused to pay on the threats to their house was that she did not want to \"play along\" with the corrupt systemthat doing so was against her conscience and Christian beliefs. In 2006, they moved to the United States to escape the threats and demands. Vanchurina believes that the threats and demands will resume if they return to Russia and that the only way to avoid them would be to \"give everything away and be ... poor.\"</p>\n<p>In an oral decision dated June 5, 2008, the IJ found their testimony credible, but denied Vanchurina's petition for asylum and withholding of removal, concluding that Vanchurina and Radisavlevic \"were subjected to extortion and it was no doubt an unpleasant and frightening experience, but the experiences described ... do not rise to the level of persecution.\" The IJ further held that even if this extortion constituted persecution, \"the basis for the victimization ... was economic and at no point does the evidence reveal that respondents were victimized on account of one of the five protected areas.\" <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). Finding Vanchurina ineligible for asylum, the IJ found that she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> could not meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of Vanchurina's application for asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that \"the nature and context of the respondents' claimone that entails criminal extortion and threatsdoes not implicate an enumerated protected ground.\" The BIA found that because the respondents did not qualify for asylum, they failed to meet the higher burden for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>No pure question of law is presented by this petition. We review the BIA's findings under the substantial evidence standard. <i>Matovu v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203964\"><a href=\"/opinion/203964/matovu-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 386 (1st Cir.2009). \"Under this deferential standard, we accept these findings so long as they are grounded in reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Sharari v.

A showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <i>Anacassus v.
