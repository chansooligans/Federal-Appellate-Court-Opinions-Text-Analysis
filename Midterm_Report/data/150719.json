Marie Ritza Balan, a native and\n\ncitizen of Haiti, petitions for review of an order by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming the ruling of an immigration\n\njudge (\"IJ\") denying Balan's application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval (\"WOR\"), and relief under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").     For very good reason, the IJ found that Balan's claims of\n\npersecution were not credible and that Balan had failed to show\n\neither past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution.\n\nBalan may apply if she is eligible for temporary protected status\n\nunder a moratorium declared after the recent disasters in Haiti.\n\nDesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 75 Fed. Reg.\n\n3476-02, 3477-78 (Jan. 21, 2010).          That may affect whether the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security executes an order of removal, but\n\nit does not affect adjudication of her petition.\n\n                                    I.\n\n             Balan arrived in the United States without inspection at\n\nSt. Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, on May 13, 2004.             On June 23,\n\n2004, she filed an affirmative application for asylum, WOR, and CAT\n\nrelief, asserting that she feared returning to Haiti because she\n\nwould   be   subject   to   persecution   on   account   of   her   husband's\n\ninvolvement in politics.\n\n             We describe Balan's application, which differed from her\n\ntestimony.     Balan stated that her husband was the driver for a\n\nHaitian political leader, Evans Paul.          Evans Paul was the former\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmayor of Port-Au-Prince and a founder of the Democratic Unity\n\nFederation (known in Haiti as KID), a political party opposed to\n\nformer Haitian president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Aristide's\n\npolitical party, the Lavalas Party. On February 29, 2004, Aristide\n\nresigned from the presidency.\n\n          Balan alleged that following Aristide's resignation, her\n\nhusband   was   shot   and   she   was   kidnapped   and   threatened.\n\nSpecifically, Balan stated that on March 4, 2004, after her husband\n\ndropped off Paul at his home, Balan's husband's car was surrounded\n\nby a group of Lavalas party supporters.         When Balan's husband\n\nrefused to get out of the car and instead drove away, he was shot\n\nbut not killed.\n\n          Then, on April 17, 2004, a group of people broke into\n\nBalan's house while her husband was away and asked where her\n\nhusband was.    The people then beat her, kidnapped her, and told\n\nBalan they were going to kill her.       When they arrived at a bushy\n\narea outside of town, the group let her go, purportedly because she\n\nwas a woman.      They told Balan that if she did not leave her\n\nhusband, they would kill Balan and her husband.      Balan left Haiti\n\nand made her way to the United States.\n\n          After an interview with an asylum officer, Balan was\n\ndenied relief and referred for a hearing before an IJ.      The asylum\n\nofficer found that Balan's testimony lacked credibility because she\n\n\"was unable to provide sufficient detail to establish her claim.\"\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fBalan could not name the day on which her husband was shot or the\n\npolitical party to which he belonged.     Further, after asserting\n\nthat she was aware of the contents of her asylum application,\n\nduring the interview, Balan gave the officer a materially differing\n\naccount of the April 17 kidnapping, saying that the persons who\n\nabducted her were police officers and that they raped her before\n\nshe was released.\n\n          In March 2006 the Department of Homeland Security served\n\nBalan with a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability.\n\nBalan apparently conceded removability.\n\n          A month before her hearing before the IJ, Balan submitted\n\nan affidavit that repeated the shooting and kidnapping incidents\n\nshe alleged in her asylum application.   But she did not allege that\n\nshe had been sexually assaulted during the April 17 abduction or\n\nthat the people who abducted her were police officers.\n\n          An IJ heard Balan's claims on November 28, 2007.    Balan\n\nwas the only witness to testify.     She recounted the incident in\n\nwhich her husband was shot, saying it occurred on the same date she\n\nhad listed in her asylum application, March 4, 2004.       She also\n\ndescribed a kidnapping incident similar in some ways to the one\n\nalleged in her asylum application, in which five men searching for\n\nher husband abducted and beat her and then left her outside of\n\ntown, with a warning that she would be killed if she stayed with\n\nher husband.   Significantly, though, Balan testified that this\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fincident occurred on February 14, 2004.                  That date placed the\n\nincident before rather than after the shooting, as Balan had stated\n\nin her earlier application.              Balan also made no mention of the\n\nsexual assault she had alleged during her asylum interview but did\n\nnot mention in her application.\n\n                  Balan testified that she had not had any other problems\n\nin Haiti.          However, when asked specifically about the April 17,\n\n2004, incident described in her asylum application, Balan testified\n\nthat she had also been abducted that day and that it was a separate\n\nincident from the one she described as having occurred on February\n\n14.\n\n                  When cross-examined about these inconsistencies, Balan\n\nsaid       that    she   did   not   understand   the   questions.   She   also\n\nacknowledged that she told the asylum officer that she had been\n\nsexually assaulted during the April 17, 2004, incident but made no\n\nsuch claim in her asylum application or in her hearing testimony.\n\nShe did not explain any of these discrepancies.\n\n                  Citing these inconsistencies,1 Balan's failure to explain\n\nthem, and Balan's \"feigned lack of understanding\" during the\n\nhearing of questions meant to address the inconsistencies, the IJ,\n\n\n\n       1\n          The IJ also noted that Balan gave inconsistent accounts\nregarding her husband's whereabouts. She told the asylum officer\nthat her husband had been turned back to Haiti after he had tried\nto escape to the United States by boat. At the hearing, Balan said\nthat he escaped to Guadeloupe and was ultimately arrested in Saint\nMartin and sent back to Haiti.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fin an oral opinion, found Balan's testimony \"non-credible and\n\nunreliable.\"   The IJ also found that, even assuming her testimony\n\nwas credible, Balan could not establish a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution because the groups she claimed to be threatening her,\n\nsupporters of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, were\n\nno longer in power.   Because Balan could not meet the burden for\n\nasylum, the IJ also concluded that Balan could not meet the heavier\n\nburden to show entitlement to WOR.     Finally, the IJ found Balan not\n\nentitled to CAT relief because the group she feared was not a part\n\nof the government.\n\n          Balan appealed to the BIA, although she did not object to\n\nthe IJ's credibility findings.    In its written opinion, the BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision, concluding that the adverse credibility\n\nfinding made it impossible for Balan to show past persecution, that\n\nBalan could not show future persecution, and that she was not\n\nentitled to WOR or CAT relief.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          \"When 'the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling' but\n\nalso 'discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review\n\nboth the IJ's and BIA's opinions.'          We also review the IJ's\n\ncredibility determination when the BIA adopted it.\"           Weng v.\n\nHolder, 593 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting     Cuko v. Mukasey,\n\n522 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 2008)) (internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           We review findings of fact for substantial evidence and\n\nare required \"to uphold the agency's findings so long as the record\n\ndoes not 'compel a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary\n\ndetermination.'\"       Rivas-Mira v.

Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008)).\n\nWe uphold credibility findings if \"the IJ has given reasoned\n\nconsideration to the evidence and has provided a cogent explanation\n\nfor his finding.\"      Muñoz-Monsalve v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2008). Legal conclusions are generally reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n           To receive asylum, an applicant must show that she is a\n\n\"refugee,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b), meaning that she is unwilling to\n\nreturn to her home country \"because of persecution or a well\n\nfounded   fear    of   persecution   on     account   of   race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion,\" id. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Anacassus v. Holder, 602\n\nF.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2010).               An applicant that shows past\n\npersecution is \"presumed to have a well-founded fear\" of future\n\npersecution.     8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).\n\n           An applicant may meet her burden to show past or future\n\npersecution on the basis of her own testimony alone.           See Settenda\n\nv. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).               But incredible\n\ntestimony can be \"disregarded or sharply discounted,\" Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2005), and for that reason\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f\"an adverse credibility finding can prove fatal\" to a claim, Pan v.\n\nGonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Although Balan argues to us that she was a victim of past\n\npersecution, she does not challenge the BIA's and IJ's credibility\n\nfindings, which means that any challenge to the credibility finding\n\nis waived.       See Pangemanan v. Holder, 569 F.3d 1, 3 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).      In    any   event,   we    would    affirm    the    BIA's    and    IJ's\n\ncredibility      determinations       because   they     clearly   gave       Balan's\n\nevidence      \"reasoned      consideration\"        and      provided          \"cogent\n\nexplanation[s]\" for their conclusions. Muñoz-Monsalve, 511 F.3d at\n\n5.     Both cited to specific inconsistencies in her testimony and\n\nexplained why they undermined the credibility of her account.\n\n            Since Balan was the only person to testify to her past\n\npersecution, she has provided no credible evidence to support a\n\nfinding of past persecution, and we are not compelled to find\n\ncontrary to the BIA's conclusion that Balan has failed to meet her\n\nburden.\n\n            In any event, substantial evidence supports the BIA's and\n\nIJ's    findings     that   Balan     cannot    show     likelihood      of   future\n\npersecution because of changed circumstances in Haiti.                          Balan\n\nasserts on appeal that Haiti remains a dangerous place for her as\n\na general matter, but she cites to no evidence in the record that\n\nsupports her position.       Balan's testimony and the country reports\n\nshe submitted do not compel a contrary finding.                 At most they show\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthat Balan was afraid of the Lavalas party, which, as the IJ and\n\nBIA noted, is no longer in power in Haiti.\n\n          Because we are affirming the BIA's and IJ's findings on\n\nthe asylum claim, we also affirm denial of Balan's claim for WOR.\n\nSee Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; Settenda, 377 F.3d at 93.\n\n          Balan also failed to raise a challenge to the BIA's and\n\nIJ's findings on her CAT claim, which is therefore waived.   In any\n\nevent, substantial evidence supported the conclusion that Balan\n\nwould not be subjected to torture by or with the acquiescence of\n\nthe Haitian government if she were removed to Haiti.   See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c).\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

On June 23,\n\n2004, she filed an affirmative application for asylum, WOR, and CAT\n\nrelief, asserting that she feared returning to Haiti because she\n\nwould   be   subject   to   persecution   on   account   of   her   husband's\n\ninvolvement in politics.\n\n             We describe Balan's application, which differed from her\n\ntestimony.     Balan stated that her husband was the driver for a\n\nHaitian political leader, Evans Paul.          Evans Paul was the former\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmayor of Port-Au-Prince and a founder of the Democratic Unity\n\nFederation (known in Haiti as KID), a political party opposed to\n\nformer Haitian president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Aristide's\n\npolitical party, the Lavalas Party. On February 29, 2004, Aristide\n\nresigned from the presidency.\n\n          Balan alleged that following Aristide's resignation, her\n\nhusband   was   shot   and   she   was   kidnapped   and   threatened.\n\nSpecifically, Balan stated that on March 4, 2004, after her husband\n\ndropped off Paul at his home, Balan's husband's car was surrounded\n\nby a group of Lavalas party supporters.         When Balan's husband\n\nrefused to get out of the car and instead drove away, he was shot\n\nbut not killed.\n\n          Then, on April 17, 2004, a group of people broke into\n\nBalan's house while her husband was away and asked where her\n\nhusband was.    The people then beat her, kidnapped her, and told\n\nBalan they were going to kill her.       When they arrived at a bushy\n\narea outside of town, the group let her go, purportedly because she\n\nwas a woman.      They told Balan that if she did not leave her\n\nhusband, they would kill Balan and her husband.      Balan left Haiti\n\nand made her way to the United States.\n\n          After an interview with an asylum officer, Balan was\n\ndenied relief and referred for a hearing before an IJ.      The asylum\n\nofficer found that Balan's testimony lacked credibility because she\n\n\"was unable to provide sufficient detail to establish her claim.\"\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fBalan could not name the day on which her husband was shot or the\n\npolitical party to which he belonged.     Further, after asserting\n\nthat she was aware of the contents of her asylum application,\n\nduring the interview, Balan gave the officer a materially differing\n\naccount of the April 17 kidnapping, saying that the persons who\n\nabducted her were police officers and that they raped her before\n\nshe was released.\n\n          In March 2006 the Department of Homeland Security served\n\nBalan with a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability.\n\nBalan apparently conceded removability.\n\n          A month before her hearing before the IJ, Balan submitted\n\nan affidavit that repeated the shooting and kidnapping incidents\n\nshe alleged in her asylum application.   But she did not allege that\n\nshe had been sexually assaulted during the April 17 abduction or\n\nthat the people who abducted her were police officers.\n\n          An IJ heard Balan's claims on November 28, 2007.    Balan\n\nwas the only witness to testify.     She recounted the incident in\n\nwhich her husband was shot, saying it occurred on the same date she\n\nhad listed in her asylum application, March 4, 2004.       She also\n\ndescribed a kidnapping incident similar in some ways to the one\n\nalleged in her asylum application, in which five men searching for\n\nher husband abducted and beat her and then left her outside of\n\ntown, with a warning that she would be killed if she stayed with\n\nher husband.   Significantly, though, Balan testified that this\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fincident occurred on February 14, 2004.                  That date placed the\n\nincident before rather than after the shooting, as Balan had stated\n\nin her earlier application.              Balan also made no mention of the\n\nsexual assault she had alleged during her asylum interview but did\n\nnot mention in her application.\n\n                  Balan testified that she had not had any other problems\n\nin Haiti.          However, when asked specifically about the April 17,\n\n2004, incident described in her asylum application, Balan testified\n\nthat she had also been abducted that day and that it was a separate\n\nincident from the one she described as having occurred on February\n\n14.\n\n                  When cross-examined about these inconsistencies, Balan\n\nsaid       that    she   did   not   understand   the   questions.   She   also\n\nacknowledged that she told the asylum officer that she had been\n\nsexually assaulted during the April 17, 2004, incident but made no\n\nsuch claim in her asylum application or in her hearing testimony.\n\nShe did not explain any of these discrepancies.\n\n                  Citing these inconsistencies,1 Balan's failure to explain\n\nthem, and Balan's \"feigned lack of understanding\" during the\n\nhearing of questions meant to address the inconsistencies, the IJ,\n\n\n\n       1\n          The IJ also noted that Balan gave inconsistent accounts\nregarding her husband's whereabouts. She told the asylum officer\nthat her husband had been turned back to Haiti after he had tried\nto escape to the United States by boat. At the hearing, Balan said\nthat he escaped to Guadeloupe and was ultimately arrested in Saint\nMartin and sent back to Haiti.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fin an oral opinion, found Balan's testimony \"non-credible and\n\nunreliable.\"   The IJ also found that, even assuming her testimony\n\nwas credible, Balan could not establish a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution because the groups she claimed to be threatening her,\n\nsupporters of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, were\n\nno longer in power.   Because Balan could not meet the burden for\n\nasylum, the IJ also concluded that Balan could not meet the heavier\n\nburden to show entitlement to WOR.     Finally, the IJ found Balan not\n\nentitled to CAT relief because the group she feared was not a part\n\nof the government.\n\n          Balan appealed to the BIA, although she did not object to\n\nthe IJ's credibility findings.    In its written opinion, the BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision, concluding that the adverse credibility\n\nfinding made it impossible for Balan to show past persecution, that\n\nBalan could not show future persecution, and that she was not\n\nentitled to WOR or CAT relief.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          \"When 'the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling' but\n\nalso 'discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review\n\nboth the IJ's and BIA's opinions.'

See Pangemanan v.

In    any   event,   we    would    affirm    the    BIA's    and    IJ's\n\ncredibility      determinations       because   they     clearly   gave       Balan's\n\nevidence      \"reasoned      consideration\"        and      provided          \"cogent\n\nexplanation[s]\" for their conclusions. Muñoz-Monsalve, 511 F.3d at\n\n5.     Both cited to specific inconsistencies in her testimony and\n\nexplained why they undermined the credibility of her account.\n\n            Since Balan was the only person to testify to her past\n\npersecution, she has provided no credible evidence to support a\n\nfinding of past persecution, and we are not compelled to find\n\ncontrary to the BIA's conclusion that Balan has failed to meet her\n\nburden.\n\n            In any event, substantial evidence supports the BIA's and\n\nIJ's    findings     that   Balan     cannot    show     likelihood      of   future\n\npersecution because of changed circumstances in Haiti.                          Balan\n\nasserts on appeal that Haiti remains a dangerous place for her as\n\na general matter, but she cites to no evidence in the record that\n\nsupports her position.       Balan's testimony and the country reports\n\nshe submitted do not compel a contrary finding.                 At most they show\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthat Balan was afraid of the Lavalas party, which, as the IJ and\n\nBIA noted, is no longer in power in Haiti.\n\n          Because we are affirming the BIA's and IJ's findings on\n\nthe asylum claim, we also affirm denial of Balan's claim for WOR.\n\nSee Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; Settenda, 377 F.3d at 93.\n\n          Balan also failed to raise a challenge to the BIA's and\n\nIJ's findings on her CAT claim, which is therefore waived.   In any\n\nevent, substantial evidence supported the conclusion that Balan\n\nwould not be subjected to torture by or with the acquiescence of\n\nthe Haitian government if she were removed to Haiti.   See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(c).\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
