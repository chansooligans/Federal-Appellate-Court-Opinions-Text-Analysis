He  asserts that  the trial  court  erred in\n\ndenying his Motion for  a Judgment of Acquittal in  that the\n\ngovernment presented insufficient evidence at trial to prove\n\nthat  he  aided and  abetted  mail fraud.    Furthermore, he\n\nasserts  that  the  trial  judge  erred  in  admitting  into\n\nevidence  under  Rule  801(d)(1)(B)   certain  conversations\n\nbetween a government witness and another  party.  We REVERSE\n\nthe   conviction,   finding   the   evidence   insufficient.\n\nTherefore, we do not reach the Rule 801(d)(1)(B) issue.\n\nI.   \n  \n\n          In September  of 1987, David Morrison,  who at the\n\ntime resided  in a halfway house  in Roxbury, Massachusetts,\n\ncontacted  his brother,  James  Morrison, a  captain in  the\n\nBoston Fire Department.  David wished to purchase a new car,\n\nbut  was unable  to  obtain credit,  so  he asked  James  to\n\npurchase and register the  car in his own name,  using money\n\nsupplied  by David  both for  the down  payment and  for all\n\nsubsequent car  payments.   James agreed, and  purchased the\n\ncar, a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice [\"the Caprice\" or \"the  car\"],\n\nin  the   manner  outlined.     General  Motors   Acceptance\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nCorporation (\"GMAC\") financed the  purchase, and the car was\n\ninsured, in James Morrison's  name, through Aetna  Insurance\n\nCompany (\"Aetna\").   David  Morrison took possession  of the\n\ncar.\n\n          One night in  the following  month, October  1987,\n\nJames Morrison was at  work at a firehouse on  Oliver Street\n\nin Boston.   His  brother, David  Morrison, appeared at  the\n\nfirehouse in an intoxicated condition, and informed him that\n\nsomething had happened to the car, that it was in the middle\n\nof  an  intersection close  to  the firehouse,  and  that it\n\n\"won't go.\"   [Tr. 2: 129]   James went to look  at the car,\n\nrealized  that the frame appeared  to be broken,  and had it\n\ntowed  to a  lot beside the  firehouse.   A few  days later,\n\nDavid again visited James at the firehouse, and later on the\n\nsame day  the brothers communicated  by telephone.   On  the\n\nfollowing day, a tow  truck showed up at the  firehouse, the\n\ndriver asking for James Morrison.   James provided him  with\n\nthe  keys to the Caprice,  after which the  driver towed the\n\ncar away.  \n\n          A day later, James Morrison reported to the Boston\n\nPolice  that  the  car  had been  stolen  from  outside  the\n\nfirehouse on  Oliver Street.    He also  filed an  insurance\n\nclaim  with Aetna,  again  claiming that  the  car had  been\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nstolen.  Aetna allowed the claim and issued two checks dated\n\nDecember 12, 1987.   Both checks  were sent by  mail to  the\n\ndesignated payees, the first in  the amount of $14,545.05 to\n\nGMAC (the basis of Count 3 of the indictment) and the second\n\nin the amount of  $1,750.95 to James Morrison (the  basis of\n\nCount 4 of the indictment).\n\n          The story now shifts to a United States government\n\nfacility  in Watertown,  Massachusetts, where  the Chevrolet\n\nCaprice next appeared.  This facility was run by the General\n\nServices  Administration (\"GSA\")  and consisted  of a  large\n\nfield and a  number of  warehouses.  GSA  operated a  firing\n\nrange at the Watertown  facility which was used by  a number\n\nof federal law enforcement agencies and which was staffed by\n\nJustin  Gleason,  a  Federal  Protective   Services  (\"FPS\")\n\nSergeant.    The warehouses  were  used  by several  federal\n\nagencies (IRS,  DEA, Customs,  GSA), primarily for  storage.\n\nSome space at the Watertown  facility was leased to  private\n\ncompanies, among them Warner  Brothers, which used the space\n\nto  store  vehicles used  in the  filming of  the television\n\nseries  Spenser  for  Hire   (\"SFH\").    Pursuant  to  lease\n\nagreements  with GSA,  Warner  Brothers rented  Building 236\n\nfrom October 1985 through June 1987; upon the expiration  of\n\nthe lease GSA informally extended the tenancy until November\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n1987.  Building 236 was used  by the SFH special effects and\n\ntransportation  crews.    The  transportation   crew,  which\n\ntransported cars, trucks, and  trailers between Building 236\n\nand filming locations around  the Boston area, was comprised\n\nof  members of  Local  25 of  the  Teamsters Union.    These\n\nmembers  included  defendant Paul  Loder,  who  worked as  a\n\ndriver, and his co-defendant,  Richard Murray, who worked as\n\na  \"co-captain\" of  the  transportation crew.   Murray  also\n\nowned  Star  Auto  Parts  in  Somerville,  Massachusetts,  a\n\ncompany that was licensed to buy and sell auto  parts and to\n\noperate a junkyard, and,  prior to the events of  this case,\n\nLoder had worked there for Murray.   \n\n          Another   of  the   buildings  at   the  Watertown\n\nfacility, Building 234, contained a fenced off space where a\n\nnumber of new FPS police vehicles were being stored.  Justin\n\nGleason,1  the FPS  Sergeant who  staffed the  firing range,\n\n                    \n\n1Justin  Gleason was  indicted for  two counts  of receiving\nunlawful  gratuities  in  return  for  overlooking  unlawful\nactivities at the  Watertown facility.  He  was charged with\nreceiving the use of two Ford cars, a 1987 Thunderbird and a\n1988 Country Squire Wagon, that had been furnished to SFH by\nFord Motor  Company for  filming purposes.   These cars  had\nbeen  subject to water damage  so, although they appeared to\nbe in excellent  condition, Ford would not  sell or warranty\nthem  and instead  furnished  them to  SFH  to be  used  for\nspecial effects  purposes.   In  September of  1990, a  jury\nreturned  a  guilty verdict  against  Gleason  on these  two\ncounts of receiving gratuities.   At his sentencing hearing,\nGleason agreed  to cooperate  with the government  in return\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ntestified that  in the fall of  1987 he became aware  that a\n\n1987 Chevrolet  Caprice was  parked among the  FPS vehicles.\n\nRunning a  Vehicle Identification  Number (\"VIN\")  check, he\n\nlearned that the Caprice was registered to Morrison.  Asking\n\nMurray about the car, Gleason  was informed that Murray \"had\n\nbeen roped into something  that he can't get  out of and  he\n\nwas  going to  get  rid  of  it.\"   [Tr.  2:193]    In  this\n\nconversation  and  subsequent  conversations, Gleason  asked\n\nMurray repeatedly to remove  the car from Building 234.   In\n\none of these conversations, Murray told Gleason that the car\n\nwas  registered to \"a high  official, the captain  of a fire\n\ndepartment,\" and  that the  car was  in a  damaged condition\n\nbecause \"somebody got drunk and ran over a Jersey  barrier.\"\n\n[Tr. 2:194]  Gleason also testified to having a conversation\n\nwith Loder about the Chevrolet Caprice, in which  Loder said\n\nthat he  was helping Murray get  rid of the car  and that he\n\n                    \n\nfor a recommendation by the government that he be  sentenced\nto  probation only.   He did in  fact receive  a sentence of\nprobation.  Gleason  testified before the grand  jury and at\ntrial as an immunized witness.  At trial, the information as\nto  Gleason's guilty  verdict, sentencing,  and immunization\nwas  presented to the jury on direct examination.  This gave\nrise  to defendant's second claim  on appeal, that the lower\ncourt erred in permitting the government to introduce  prior\nconsistent statements of Gleason to Adams because it was the\ngovernment, not the defendant, who first raised the issue of\nGleason's credibility in its opening statement and in direct\nexamination of Gleason.  Because we grant defendant's motion\nfor acquittal, we do not reach this second issue.     \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nhad  \"taken  the  plate off  for  insurance.\"   [Tr.  2:195]\n\nFinally,  Gleason  testified  that,  when  he  went  to  the\n\nWatertown facility one weekend, he discovered the front gate\n\nopen.  He went to Building 234 and there he saw Murray and a\n\nsecond individual whose face was obscured by a welder's mask\n\ncutting the top off  the Caprice.  He  again told Murray  to\n\nget the car out of the building, and  when he returned later\n\nthe Caprice was gone.     \n\n          On  November  5, 1987,  during  the  course of  an\n\ninvestigation into the activities at the Watertown facility,\n\nFPS Criminal Investigator William Adams noticed two vehicles\n\nin  that area  that  did  not belong  to  FPS  -- a  vehicle\n\nbelonging  to  Justin  Gleason,  and  the Chevrolet  Caprice\n\nregistered to James Morrison.   Adams and Gleason were long-\n\nstanding  acquaintances,   having  met   in  1978.     In  a\n\nconversation  on November 5, Gleason  told Adams that he had\n\nmade arrangements to keep  the vehicle in storage for  a few\n\nweeks until it could be cut  up.  By running the VIN through\n\nthe  National  Crime Information  Center  (\"NCIC\") computer,\n\nAdams learned that  the Caprice had been reported  stolen on\n\nOctober 28, 1987.  Adams arranged for a special agent of the\n\nInternal Revenue  Service (\"IRS\")  to  come to  the site  on\n\nNovember  25, 1987 to take  pictures of the  Caprice.  Adams\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nconducted surveillance, and at  some point after November 25\n\nhe  noticed that the car  had been removed;  however, he did\n\nnot  know  precisely  when  the car  was  removed  from  the\n\nWatertown GSA facility.  \n\n          Between December of 1987 and early summer of 1988,\n\nAdams,  without Gleason's knowledge,  tape recorded a number\n\nof  conversations between  Adams and  Gleason.   In  a taped\n\nconversation on  February 8,  1988, Gleason told  Adams that\n\nMurray hid the car \"until they could get rid of it\" and that\n\nMurray  said he wanted to get the  parts from the car.  [Tr.\n\n3:112-114]     The  tapes,  however,  did   not  corroborate\n\nGleason's  testimony that  he had  seen Murray  and another,\n\nunidentified  person cutting up  the Caprice.   Furthermore,\n\nGleason did not  say to Adams on tape that Loder admitted to\n\nGleason  that  he  helped Murray  to  get  rid  of the  car,\n\nalthough Gleason later testified that Loder did indeed admit\n\nto this.2           \n\n                    \n\n2Defendant   argues  that   several  facts   call  Gleason's\ncredibility, which is  central to  Loder's conviction,  into\nquestion.     Gleason   testified  to   consulting   with  a\npsychiatrist  shortly after  his conviction  due to  fear of\nbeing  accused of  something  he did  not  do.   He  further\ntestified to taking a number of medications, due both to his\npsychiatric condition  and to a back  injury, which affected\nhis  memory, particularly  with  regard to  dates.   Gleason\ndenied ever using a counterfeit Massachusetts Police license\nplate on  his car,  but Adams  and Belmont  Police Detective\nJohn Trischetta testified to  seeing a fake police  plate on\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nII.\n   \n\n          When   a   defendant   challenges   his   criminal\n\nconviction, claiming  that the government failed  to present\n\nsufficient  evidence to  prove the  defendant guilty  of the\n\ncharged crime, the court is faced with a formidable standard\n\nof  review.  In examining  such a challenge,  the court must\n\n\"view the evidence, together with all reasonable  inferences\n\nthat  may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to\n\nthe  government,\"   United States  v. Campa, 679  F.2d 1006,\n                                           \n\n1010 (1st Cir. 1982),  and while so doing, must  ask whether\n\n\"a rational trier of  facts could have found guilt  beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"  United States v.

The\n                              \n\ncourt  must  apply this  standard  both  to  direct  and  to\n\ncircumstantial   evidence;  \"[c]ircumstantial   evidence  is\n\nintrinsically no different from testimonial evidence, and is\n\nentitled to similar weight.\"   United States v.

Finally,  Gleason testified to  obeying all\nterms  and conditions  of his federal  parole, but  on cross\nexamination  he  conceded  that  he had  been  convicted  of\nshoplifting while on federal  parole, although no action had\nbeen taken against him by his probation officer.  \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthe government may use  circumstantial evidence to prove its\n\ncase.   However,  the  total evidence,  with all  reasonable\n\ninferences  made   in  the  light  most   favorable  to  the\n\ngovernment, must be such that a rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found guilt  beyond a reasonable doubt.

Furthermore, the government need\n     \n\nnot   present  evidence  that   precludes  every  reasonable\n\nhypothesis  inconsistent with  guilt in  order to  sustain a\n\nconviction.

In\n\nother words, the government must present evidence that would\n\nallow  a rational trier of  fact to conclude  that Loder had\n\nknowledge that he  was furthering mail  fraud.  Although  he\n\nneed not  be aware of all  the details of the  mail fraud, a\n\ngeneral suspicion on Loder's  part that his participation in\n\ndismantling  the Caprice was  \"for some  nefarious purpose\"4\n\nis not enough to make him guilty of aiding and abetting mail\n\nfraud.    \n\n          In  this case,  the  government  claims  that  the\n\nrecord supports the conclusion that Paul Loder  was aware of\n\n                    \n\n4Near  the  close  of  the  evidence,  the  judge  made  the\nfollowing comment at a side bar conference:\n          I  don't understand  the evidence.   You\n          say these  two guys  get a car  and they\n          cut it up.   Certainly they have to know\n          when they  cut up a  brand-new car  that\n          there is some nefarious purpose.\n(Tr. 4:7).  Accepting  the trial judge's characterization of\nwhat  the defendant  would \"have  to know,\"  the requirement\nthat the defendant share the specific criminal intent of the\nprincipal would still not be met.   \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nthe fraudulent scheme planned by the  Morrisons, and that he\n\nwas a willing  participant in  that scheme.   In support  of\n\nthis assertion,  the government points to  several pieces of\n\nevidence:  Loder  had, in  the  past, worked  for  Murray at\n\nMurray's  auto  parts  store  and   was  currently  Murray's\n\nsubordinate  on  the  transportation  crew  of SFH;  Gleason\n\ntestified  that, in  separate  conversations with  him, both\n\nMurray  and  Loder  had  talked  about  getting rid  of  the\n\nCaprice, and  Loder mentioned keeping the  license plate for\n\ninsurance;  Gleason also  testified that  he saw  Murray and\n\nanother person  whose face  was obscured by  a welding  mask\n\ncutting  the  roof  off  of  the  Caprice  in  a  government\n\nwarehouse on  a weekend; and the  Caprice, although damaged,\n\nwas a brand  new car.  The government argues that a rational\n\ntrier of fact could reasonably infer from this evidence that\n\nLoder  and  Murray were  responsible  for  the Caprice,  had\n\ndismantled and disposed of it, and did so for some nefarious\n\npurpose.   The  government further  maintains that  the jury\n\ncould as easily have inferred or concluded from the evidence\n\nthat  the  nefarious  purpose   was  that  of  a  fraudulent\n\ninsurance scheme as  that the nefarious purpose  was that of\n\ndisposal of a stolen  car.  The defendants counter  with the\n\nargument that even  if the  evidence would allow  a jury  to\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nconclude that Loder participated  in dismantling the car and\n\nknew there was something wrong with doing so, the government\n\nhas  nevertheless failed  to  show the  specific intent  and\n\nknowledge necessary  to sustain  a conviction of  aiding and\n\nabetting in mail fraud.  \n\n          The government contends that the evidence supports\n\na  finding that  Loder did  have specific  knowledge  of the\n                          \n\nMorrisons'  insurance  scam and  that  he  acted in  willful\n\nfurtherance of  the scam.   They  first  maintain, and  this\n\ncourt agrees,  that based  on Gleason's testimony,  the jury\n\ncould appropriately  conclude that  Murray had  knowledge of\n\nthe  Morrisons'  identity,  of  the   circumstances  of  the\n\naccident  in  which  the  Caprice  was  damaged,  and,  most\n\nimportantly,  of the Morrisons'  fraudulent insurance claim.\n\nThe prosecution then  asserts that \"[b]ecause  the defendant\n\nand Murray dismantled  and disposed of the car together, the\n\njury could  reasonably conclude  as well that  Murray passed\n\nsuch information on to  the defendant in explanation of  the\n\npurpose  of their efforts.\"   (Appellee's Br. at  20)   This\n\nassertion  is at  the core  of the  government's case;  if a\n\nrational  jury  could  reasonably  infer  from  the evidence\n\npresented first  that Loder  did help Murray  to disassemble\n\nthe Caprice and second that  Murray explained the mail fraud\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nscheme  to  Loder,  then  this  court  must  uphold  Loder's\n\nconviction.\n\n          The question then, is whether these two inferences\n\nare indeed  reasonable.   This  court finds  that the  first\n\ninference, that  the person helping Murray  to dismantle the\n\nCaprice was Paul Loder, is reasonable.  Although the face of\n\nthe person that Gleason saw helping Murray was obscured by a\n\nwelding mask, Gleason nevertheless testified that Loder told\n\nhim that he helped Murray to get rid of the Caprice.  Should\n\nthe jurors chose  to believe Gleason,  it is reasonable  for\n\nthem to conclude that Loder  did as he said he would  do and\n\nhelped  Murray  to  dismantle  the  car.    Indeed,  such  a\n\nconclusion would  be supported  by Loder's own  admission of\n\nactual  participation.   It  is true  that  Gleason did  not\n\nmention  Loder's admission  of helping Murray  while Gleason\n\nwas  on tape.  However,  a reasonable jury could nonetheless\n\nhave  believed that Loder did tell Gleason that he helped to\n\ndismantle the car.  Likewise, the defendant's concerns as to\n\nGleason's  reliability as  a witness  are not  sufficient to\n\nendanger the  jury's factual  finding with regard  to Loder.\n\nDrawing, as we must, all  reasonable inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government, we find that nothing would\n\ninhibit  a   rational  jury   from  believing  Gleason   and\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nconcluding that Loder  assisted Murray in  disassembling the\n\nCaprice.   \n\n          However, we reject the notion that a rational jury\n\ncould have  reasonably made  the second inference  at issue.\n\nTo assume that just because  Murray and Loder dismantled the\n\ncar  together therefore  Murray  told Loder  that they  were\n\ndoing  so in  furtherance  of a  scheme  of mail  fraud,  is\n\nunreasonable   and implausible.   This  court finds  that no\n\nevidence at  trial was presented that would allow a rational\n\ntrier  of  fact  to   conclude  that  Murray  conveyed  this\n\ninformation to  Loder.   No one testified  to telling  Loder\n\nabout the mail fraud, no  one testified that Loder mentioned\n\nknowing about the mail fraud, no one even testified to being\n\ntold that Loder had been told  about the mail fraud.   While\n\nit is  true that circumstantial  evidence must be  given the\n\nsame   weight   as  testimonial   evidence   in  determining\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, in  this case, even giving  the\n\ngovernment  the benefit  of  the  doubt, the  circumstantial\n\nevidence is too  weak to support  a reasonable inference  of\n\nguilt.\n\n          We have also considered whether a reasonable  jury\n\ncould  conclude --  even  without any  direct disclosure  to\n\nLoder by Murray -- that Loder must have known that insurance\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nfraud  was  the objective  in destroying  the  car.   If the\n\nsurreptitious  destruction of  cars occurred  only  for this\n\npurpose, or at  least rarely  for any other,  that might  be\n\nenough for a jury  to infer knowledge on Loder's part.   But\n\nin fact there are other plausible reasons for such an action\n\n(e.g., \"chopping\" a stolen  car to recover parts; destroying\n     \n\nthe evidence  of  another  crime such  as  bank  robbery  or\n\nkidnapping).   Thus, absent  additional evidence, we  do not\n\nthink that a jury  could conclude beyond a reasonable  doubt\n\nthat Loder must have known that the purpose in this instance\n\nwas  insurance fraud.   This court declines  to sustain Paul\n\nLoder's conviction.                       \n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n",

A few days later, David again visited James at the firehouse, and later on the same day the brothers communicated by telephone.  On the following day, a tow truck showed up at the firehouse, the driver asking for James Morrison.  James provided him with the keys to the Caprice, after which the driver towed the car away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A day later, James Morrison reported to the Boston Police that the car had been stolen from outside the firehouse on Oliver Street.  He also filed an insurance claim with Aetna, again claiming that the car had been stolen.  Aetna allowed the claim and issued two checks dated December 12, 1987.  Both checks were sent by mail to the designated payees, the first in the amount of $14,545.05 to GMAC (the basis of Count 3 of the indictment) and the second in the amount of $1,750.95 to James Morrison (the basis of Count 4 of the indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story now shifts to a United States government facility in Watertown, Massachusetts, where the Chevrolet Caprice next appeared.  This facility was run by the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") and consisted of a large field and a number of warehouses.  GSA operated a firing range at the Watertown facility which was used by a number of federal law enforcement agencies and which was staffed by Justin Gleason, a Federal Protective Services (\"FPS\") Sergeant.  The warehouses were used by several federal agencies (IRS, DEA, Customs, GSA), primarily for storage.  Some space at the Watertown facility was leased to private companies, among them Warner Brothers, which used the space to store vehicles used in the filming of the television series Spenser for Hire (\"SFH\").  Pursuant to lease agreements with GSA, Warner Brothers rented Building 236 from October 1985 through June 1987;  upon the expiration of the lease GSA informally extended the tenancy until November 1987.  Building 236 was used by the SFH special effects and transportation crews.  The transportation crew, which transported cars, trucks, and trailers between Building 236 and filming locations around the Boston area, was comprised of members of Local 25 of the Teamsters Union.  These members included defendant Paul Loder, who worked as a driver, and his co-defendant, Richard Murray, who worked as a \"co-captain\" of the transportation crew.  Murray also owned Star Auto Parts in Somerville, Massachusetts, a company that was licensed to buy and sell auto parts and to operate a junkyard, and, prior to the events of this case, Loder had worked there for Murray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another of the buildings at the Watertown facility, Building 234, contained a fenced off space where a number of new FPS police vehicles were being stored.  Justin Gleason,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the FPS Sergeant who staffed the firing range, testified that in the fall of 1987 he became aware that a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice was parked among the FPS vehicles.  Running a Vehicle Identification Number (\"VIN\") check, he learned that the Caprice was registered to Morrison.  Asking Murray about the car, Gleason was informed that Murray \"had been roped into something that he can't get out of and he was going to get rid of it.\"  [Tr. 2:193] In this conversation and subsequent conversations, Gleason asked Murray repeatedly to remove the car from Building 234.  In one of these conversations, Murray told Gleason that the car was registered to \"a high official, the captain of a fire department,\" and that the car was in a damaged condition because \"somebody got drunk and ran over a Jersey barrier.\"  [Tr. 2:194] Gleason also testified to having a conversation with Loder about the Chevrolet Caprice, in which Loder said that he was helping Murray get rid of the car and that he had \"taken the plate off for insurance.\"  [Tr. 2:195] Finally, Gleason testified that, when he went to the Watertown facility one weekend, he discovered the front gate open.  He went to Building 234 and there he saw Murray and a second individual whose face was obscured by a welder's mask cutting the top off the Caprice.  He again told Murray to get the car out of the building, and when he returned later the Caprice was gone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 1987, during the course of an investigation into the activities at the Watertown facility, FPS Criminal Investigator William Adams noticed two vehicles in that area that did not belong to FPS--a vehicle belonging to Justin Gleason, and the Chevrolet Caprice registered to James Morrison.  Adams and Gleason were long-standing acquaintances, having met in 1978.  In a conversation on November 5, Gleason told Adams that he had made arrangements to keep the vehicle in storage for a few weeks until it could be cut up.  By running the VIN through the National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") computer, Adams learned that the Caprice had been reported stolen on October 28, 1987.  Adams arranged for a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to come to the site on November 25, 1987 to take pictures of the Caprice.  Adams conducted surveillance, and at some point after November 25 he noticed that the car had been removed;  however, he did not know precisely when the car was removed from the Watertown GSA facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December of 1987 and early summer of 1988, Adams, without Gleason's knowledge, tape recorded a number of conversations between Adams and Gleason.  In a taped conversation on February 8, 1988, Gleason told Adams that Murray hid the car \"until they could get rid of it\" and that Murray said he wanted to get the parts from the car.  [Tr. 3:112-114] The tapes, however, did not corroborate Gleason's testimony that he had seen Murray and another, unidentified person cutting up the Caprice.  Furthermore, Gleason did not say to Adams on tape that Loder admitted to Gleason that he helped Murray to get rid of the car, although Gleason later testified that Loder did indeed admit to this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant challenges his criminal conviction, claiming that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty of the charged crime, the court is faced with a formidable standard of review.  In examining such a challenge, the court must \"view the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government,\" United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d 1006, 1010 (1st Cir.1982), and while so doing, must ask whether \"a rational trier of facts could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 239 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1738, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988).  See also United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520, 527 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied 489 U.S. 1021, 109 S.Ct. 1144, 103 L.Ed.2d 204 (1989).  The court must apply this standard both to direct and to circumstantial evidence;  \"[c]ircumstantial evidence is intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence, and is entitled to similar weight.\"  United States v. Van Helden, 920 F.2d 99, 101 (1st Cir.1990) (citations omitted).  Thus, the government may use circumstantial evidence to prove its case.  However, the total evidence, with all reasonable inferences made in the light most favorable to the government, must be such that a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d at 1006.   Furthermore, the government need not present evidence that precludes every reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt in order to sustain a conviction.  United States v. Guerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d 1071, 1075 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029, 106 S.Ct. 1233, 89 L.Ed.2d 342 (1986).  Rather, the jury is at liberty to select freely among a variety of reasonable alternative constructions of the evidence.  United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110, 103 S.Ct. 738, 74 L.Ed.2d 960 (1983).

Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1989) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  See also United States v. Valencia, 907 F.2d 671, 680 (7th Cir.1990) (\"The state of mind required for conviction as an aider and abettor is the same state of mind as required for the principal offense.\");  United States v. Barclay, 560 F.2d 812 (7th Cir.1977) (appeals court reversed a conviction for bank fraud and abetting bank fraud because the trial judge's instructions permitted the defendant to be convicted without finding that he knew that the principal was going to make a false entry with the specific intent to defraud the bank, and without finding that the defendant shared the principal's specific intent to defraud the bank);  United States v. Gallishaw, 428 F.2d 760 (2d Cir.1970) (when defendant supplied a machine gun to principal which principal later used in a bank robbery, the appeals court reversed defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit a bank robbery and aiding and abetting a bank robbery because trial judge's instructions allowed jury to convict defendant without a finding that defendant shared principal's specific intent to rob a bank).  The specific intent requirement of the crime of aiding and abetting requires that the defendant consciously share the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act;  \"[a] general suspicion that an unlawful act may occur is not enough.\"  United States v. Labat, 905 F.2d 18, 23 (2d Cir.1990).  However, the government may prove its case through circumstantial evidence, and need not preclude every reasonable hypothesis in order to sustain a conviction.  See supra pp. 588-89.  Also, \"[i]t is well settled that a culpable aider and abetter need not perform the substantive offense, be present when it is performed, or be aware of the details of its execution.\"  United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 217 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to sustain a conviction in the instant case, the government must show that the defendant, Paul Loder, consciously shared in the specific criminal intent of the principals, the Morrisons, to commit mail fraud.  In other words, the government must present evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to conclude that Loder had knowledge that he was furthering mail fraud.  Although he need not be aware of all the details of the mail fraud, a general suspicion on Loder's part that his participation in dismantling the Caprice was \"for some nefarious purpose\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is not enough to make him guilty of aiding and abetting mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government claims that the record supports the conclusion that Paul Loder was aware of the fraudulent scheme planned by the Morrisons, and that he was a willing participant in that scheme.  In support of this assertion, the government points to several pieces of evidence:  Loder had, in the past, worked for Murray at Murray's auto parts store and was currently Murray's subordinate on the transportation crew of SFH;  Gleason testified that, in separate conversations with him, both Murray and Loder had talked about getting rid of the Caprice, and Loder mentioned keeping the license plate for insurance;  Gleason also testified that he saw Murray and another person whose face was obscured by a welding mask cutting the roof off of the Caprice in a government warehouse on a weekend;  and the Caprice, although damaged, was a brand new car.  The government argues that a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer from this evidence that Loder and Murray were responsible for the Caprice, had dismantled and disposed of it, and did so for some nefarious purpose.  The government further maintains that the jury could as easily have inferred or concluded from the evidence that the nefarious purpose was that of a fraudulent insurance scheme as that the nefarious purpose was that of disposal of a stolen car.  The defendants counter with the argument that even if the evidence would allow a jury to conclude that Loder participated in dismantling the car and knew there was something wrong with doing so, the government has nevertheless failed to show the specific intent and knowledge necessary to sustain a conviction of aiding and abetting in mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the evidence supports a finding that Loder did have specific knowledge of the Morrisons' insurance scam and that he acted in willful furtherance of the scam.  They first maintain, and this court agrees, that based on Gleason's testimony, the jury could appropriately conclude that Murray had knowledge of the Morrisons' identity, of the circumstances of the accident in which the Caprice was damaged, and, most importantly, of the Morrisons' fraudulent insurance claim.  The prosecution then asserts that \"[b]ecause the defendant and Murray dismantled and disposed of the car together, the jury could reasonably conclude as well that Murray passed such information on to the defendant in explanation of the purpose of their efforts.\"  (Appellee's Br. at 20) This assertion is at the core of the government's case;  if a rational jury could reasonably infer from the evidence presented first that Loder did help Murray to disassemble the Caprice and second that Murray explained the mail fraud scheme to Loder, then this court must uphold Loder's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question then, is whether these two inferences are indeed reasonable.  This court finds that the first inference, that the person helping Murray to dismantle the Caprice was Paul Loder, is reasonable.  Although the face of the person that Gleason saw helping Murray was obscured by a welding mask, Gleason nevertheless testified that Loder told him that he helped Murray to get rid of the Caprice.  Should the jurors chose to believe Gleason, it is reasonable for them to conclude that Loder did as he said he would do and helped Murray to dismantle the car.  Indeed, such a conclusion would be supported by Loder's own admission of actual participation.  It is true that Gleason did not mention Loder's admission of helping Murray while Gleason was on tape.  However, a reasonable jury could nonetheless have believed that Loder did tell Gleason that he helped to dismantle the car.  Likewise, the defendant's concerns as to Gleason's reliability as a witness are not sufficient to endanger the jury's factual finding with regard to Loder.  Drawing, as we must, all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the government, we find that nothing would inhibit a rational jury from believing Gleason and concluding that Loder assisted Murray in disassembling the Caprice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we reject the notion that a rational jury could have reasonably made the second inference at issue.  To assume that just because Murray and Loder dismantled the car together therefore Murray told Loder that they were doing so in furtherance of a scheme of mail fraud, is unreasonable and implausible.  This court finds that no evidence at trial was presented that would allow a rational trier of fact to conclude that Murray conveyed this information to Loder.  No one testified to telling Loder about the mail fraud, no one testified that Loder mentioned knowing about the mail fraud, no one even testified to being told that Loder had been told about the mail fraud.  While it is true that circumstantial evidence must be given the same weight as testimonial evidence in determining sufficiency of the evidence, in this case, even giving the government the benefit of the doubt, the circumstantial evidence is too weak to support a reasonable inference of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also considered whether a reasonable jury could conclude--even without any direct disclosure to Loder by Murray--that Loder must have known that insurance fraud was the objective in destroying the car.  If the surreptitious destruction of cars occurred only for this purpose, or at least rarely for any other, that might be enough for a jury to infer knowledge on Loder's part.  But in fact there are other plausible reasons for such an action (e.g., \"chopping\" a stolen car to recover parts;  destroying the evidence of another crime such as bank robbery or kidnapping).  Thus, absent additional evidence, we do not think that a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Loder must have known that the purpose in this instance was insurance fraud.  This court declines to sustain Paul Loder's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Justin Gleason was indicted for two counts of receiving unlawful gratuities in return for overlooking unlawful activities at the Watertown facility.  He was charged with receiving the use of two Ford cars, a 1987 Thunderbird and a 1988 Country Squire Wagon, that had been furnished to SFH by Ford Motor Company for filming purposes.  These cars had been subject to water damage so, although they appeared to be in excellent condition, Ford would not sell or warranty them and instead furnished them to SFH to be used for special effects purposes.  In September of 1990, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Gleason on these two counts of receiving gratuities.  At his sentencing hearing, Gleason agreed to cooperate with the government in return for a recommendation by the government that he be sentenced to probation only.  He did in fact receive a sentence of probation.  Gleason testified before the grand jury and at trial as an immunized witness.  At trial, the information as to Gleason's guilty verdict, sentencing, and immunization was presented to the jury on direct examination.  This gave rise to defendant's second claim on appeal, that the lower court erred in permitting the government to introduce prior consistent statements of Gleason to Adams because it was the government, not the defendant, who first raised the issue of Gleason's credibility in its opening statement and in direct examination of Gleason.  Because we grant defendant's motion for acquittal, we do not reach this second issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant argues that several facts call Gleason's credibility, which is central to Loder's conviction, into question.  Gleason testified to consulting with a psychiatrist shortly after his conviction due to fear of being accused of something he did not do.  He further testified to taking a number of medications, due both to his psychiatric condition and to a back injury, which affected his memory, particularly with regard to dates.  Gleason denied ever using a counterfeit Massachusetts Police license plate on his car, but Adams and Belmont Police Detective John Trischetta testified to seeing a fake police plate on Gleason's car.  Finally, Gleason testified to obeying all terms and conditions of his federal parole, but on cross examination he conceded that he had been convicted of shoplifting while on federal parole, although no action had been taken against him by his probation officer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The specific language of the mail fraud statute is as follows:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

David wished to purchase a new car, but was unable to obtain credit, so he asked James to purchase and register the car in his own name, using money supplied by David both for the down payment and for all subsequent car payments.  James agreed, and purchased the car, a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice [\"the Caprice\" or \"the car\"], in the manner outlined.  General Motors Acceptance Corporation (\"GMAC\") financed the purchase, and the car was insured, in James Morrison's name, through Aetna Insurance Company (\"Aetna\").  David Morrison took possession of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One night in the following month, October 1987, James Morrison was at work at a firehouse on Oliver Street in Boston.  His brother, David Morrison, appeared at the firehouse in an intoxicated condition, and informed him that something had happened to the car, that it was in the middle of an intersection close to the firehouse, and that it \"won't go.\"  [Tr. 2:  129] James went to look at the car, realized that the frame appeared to be broken, and had it towed to a lot beside the firehouse.  A few days later, David again visited James at the firehouse, and later on the same day the brothers communicated by telephone.  On the following day, a tow truck showed up at the firehouse, the driver asking for James Morrison.  James provided him with the keys to the Caprice, after which the driver towed the car away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A day later, James Morrison reported to the Boston Police that the car had been stolen from outside the firehouse on Oliver Street.  He also filed an insurance claim with Aetna, again claiming that the car had been stolen.  Aetna allowed the claim and issued two checks dated December 12, 1987.  Both checks were sent by mail to the designated payees, the first in the amount of $14,545.05 to GMAC (the basis of Count 3 of the indictment) and the second in the amount of $1,750.95 to James Morrison (the basis of Count 4 of the indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story now shifts to a United States government facility in Watertown, Massachusetts, where the Chevrolet Caprice next appeared.  This facility was run by the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") and consisted of a large field and a number of warehouses.  GSA operated a firing range at the Watertown facility which was used by a number of federal law enforcement agencies and which was staffed by Justin Gleason, a Federal Protective Services (\"FPS\") Sergeant.  The warehouses were used by several federal agencies (IRS, DEA, Customs, GSA), primarily for storage.  Some space at the Watertown facility was leased to private companies, among them Warner Brothers, which used the space to store vehicles used in the filming of the television series Spenser for Hire (\"SFH\").  Pursuant to lease agreements with GSA, Warner Brothers rented Building 236 from October 1985 through June 1987;  upon the expiration of the lease GSA informally extended the tenancy until November 1987.  Building 236 was used by the SFH special effects and transportation crews.  The transportation crew, which transported cars, trucks, and trailers between Building 236 and filming locations around the Boston area, was comprised of members of Local 25 of the Teamsters Union.  These members included defendant Paul Loder, who worked as a driver, and his co-defendant, Richard Murray, who worked as a \"co-captain\" of the transportation crew.  Murray also owned Star Auto Parts in Somerville, Massachusetts, a company that was licensed to buy and sell auto parts and to operate a junkyard, and, prior to the events of this case, Loder had worked there for Murray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another of the buildings at the Watertown facility, Building 234, contained a fenced off space where a number of new FPS police vehicles were being stored.  Justin Gleason,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the FPS Sergeant who staffed the firing range, testified that in the fall of 1987 he became aware that a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice was parked among the FPS vehicles.  Running a Vehicle Identification Number (\"VIN\") check, he learned that the Caprice was registered to Morrison.  Asking Murray about the car, Gleason was informed that Murray \"had been roped into something that he can't get out of and he was going to get rid of it.\"  [Tr. 2:193] In this conversation and subsequent conversations, Gleason asked Murray repeatedly to remove the car from Building 234.  In one of these conversations, Murray told Gleason that the car was registered to \"a high official, the captain of a fire department,\" and that the car was in a damaged condition because \"somebody got drunk and ran over a Jersey barrier.\"  [Tr. 2:194] Gleason also testified to having a conversation with Loder about the Chevrolet Caprice, in which Loder said that he was helping Murray get rid of the car and that he had \"taken the plate off for insurance.\"  [Tr. 2:195] Finally, Gleason testified that, when he went to the Watertown facility one weekend, he discovered the front gate open.  He went to Building 234 and there he saw Murray and a second individual whose face was obscured by a welder's mask cutting the top off the Caprice.  He again told Murray to get the car out of the building, and when he returned later the Caprice was gone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 1987, during the course of an investigation into the activities at the Watertown facility, FPS Criminal Investigator William Adams noticed two vehicles in that area that did not belong to FPS--a vehicle belonging to Justin Gleason, and the Chevrolet Caprice registered to James Morrison.  Adams and Gleason were long-standing acquaintances, having met in 1978.  In a conversation on November 5, Gleason told Adams that he had made arrangements to keep the vehicle in storage for a few weeks until it could be cut up.  By running the VIN through the National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") computer, Adams learned that the Caprice had been reported stolen on October 28, 1987.  Adams arranged for a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to come to the site on November 25, 1987 to take pictures of the Caprice.  Adams conducted surveillance, and at some point after November 25 he noticed that the car had been removed;  however, he did not know precisely when the car was removed from the Watertown GSA facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December of 1987 and early summer of 1988, Adams, without Gleason's knowledge, tape recorded a number of conversations between Adams and Gleason.  In a taped conversation on February 8, 1988, Gleason told Adams that Murray hid the car \"until they could get rid of it\" and that Murray said he wanted to get the parts from the car.  [Tr. 3:112-114] The tapes, however, did not corroborate Gleason's testimony that he had seen Murray and another, unidentified person cutting up the Caprice.  Furthermore, Gleason did not say to Adams on tape that Loder admitted to Gleason that he helped Murray to get rid of the car, although Gleason later testified that Loder did indeed admit to this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant challenges his criminal conviction, claiming that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty of the charged crime, the court is faced with a formidable standard of review.

In other words, the government must present evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to conclude that Loder had knowledge that he was furthering mail fraud.  Although he need not be aware of all the details of the mail fraud, a general suspicion on Loder's part that his participation in dismantling the Caprice was \"for some nefarious purpose\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is not enough to make him guilty of aiding and abetting mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government claims that the record supports the conclusion that Paul Loder was aware of the fraudulent scheme planned by the Morrisons, and that he was a willing participant in that scheme.  In support of this assertion, the government points to several pieces of evidence:  Loder had, in the past, worked for Murray at Murray's auto parts store and was currently Murray's subordinate on the transportation crew of SFH;  Gleason testified that, in separate conversations with him, both Murray and Loder had talked about getting rid of the Caprice, and Loder mentioned keeping the license plate for insurance;  Gleason also testified that he saw Murray and another person whose face was obscured by a welding mask cutting the roof off of the Caprice in a government warehouse on a weekend;  and the Caprice, although damaged, was a brand new car.  The government argues that a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer from this evidence that Loder and Murray were responsible for the Caprice, had dismantled and disposed of it, and did so for some nefarious purpose.  The government further maintains that the jury could as easily have inferred or concluded from the evidence that the nefarious purpose was that of a fraudulent insurance scheme as that the nefarious purpose was that of disposal of a stolen car.  The defendants counter with the argument that even if the evidence would allow a jury to conclude that Loder participated in dismantling the car and knew there was something wrong with doing so, the government has nevertheless failed to show the specific intent and knowledge necessary to sustain a conviction of aiding and abetting in mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the evidence supports a finding that Loder did have specific knowledge of the Morrisons' insurance scam and that he acted in willful furtherance of the scam.  They first maintain, and this court agrees, that based on Gleason's testimony, the jury could appropriately conclude that Murray had knowledge of the Morrisons' identity, of the circumstances of the accident in which the Caprice was damaged, and, most importantly, of the Morrisons' fraudulent insurance claim.  The prosecution then asserts that \"[b]ecause the defendant and Murray dismantled and disposed of the car together, the jury could reasonably conclude as well that Murray passed such information on to the defendant in explanation of the purpose of their efforts.\"  (Appellee's Br. at 20) This assertion is at the core of the government's case;  if a rational jury could reasonably infer from the evidence presented first that Loder did help Murray to disassemble the Caprice and second that Murray explained the mail fraud scheme to Loder, then this court must uphold Loder's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question then, is whether these two inferences are indeed reasonable.  This court finds that the first inference, that the person helping Murray to dismantle the Caprice was Paul Loder, is reasonable.  Although the face of the person that Gleason saw helping Murray was obscured by a welding mask, Gleason nevertheless testified that Loder told him that he helped Murray to get rid of the Caprice.  Should the jurors chose to believe Gleason, it is reasonable for them to conclude that Loder did as he said he would do and helped Murray to dismantle the car.  Indeed, such a conclusion would be supported by Loder's own admission of actual participation.  It is true that Gleason did not mention Loder's admission of helping Murray while Gleason was on tape.  However, a reasonable jury could nonetheless have believed that Loder did tell Gleason that he helped to dismantle the car.  Likewise, the defendant's concerns as to Gleason's reliability as a witness are not sufficient to endanger the jury's factual finding with regard to Loder.  Drawing, as we must, all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the government, we find that nothing would inhibit a rational jury from believing Gleason and concluding that Loder assisted Murray in disassembling the Caprice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we reject the notion that a rational jury could have reasonably made the second inference at issue.  To assume that just because Murray and Loder dismantled the car together therefore Murray told Loder that they were doing so in furtherance of a scheme of mail fraud, is unreasonable and implausible.  This court finds that no evidence at trial was presented that would allow a rational trier of fact to conclude that Murray conveyed this information to Loder.  No one testified to telling Loder about the mail fraud, no one testified that Loder mentioned knowing about the mail fraud, no one even testified to being told that Loder had been told about the mail fraud.  While it is true that circumstantial evidence must be given the same weight as testimonial evidence in determining sufficiency of the evidence, in this case, even giving the government the benefit of the doubt, the circumstantial evidence is too weak to support a reasonable inference of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also considered whether a reasonable jury could conclude--even without any direct disclosure to Loder by Murray--that Loder must have known that insurance fraud was the objective in destroying the car.  If the surreptitious destruction of cars occurred only for this purpose, or at least rarely for any other, that might be enough for a jury to infer knowledge on Loder's part.  But in fact there are other plausible reasons for such an action (e.g., \"chopping\" a stolen car to recover parts;  destroying the evidence of another crime such as bank robbery or kidnapping).  Thus, absent additional evidence, we do not think that a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Loder must have known that the purpose in this instance was insurance fraud.  This court declines to sustain Paul Loder's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Justin Gleason was indicted for two counts of receiving unlawful gratuities in return for overlooking unlawful activities at the Watertown facility.  He was charged with receiving the use of two Ford cars, a 1987 Thunderbird and a 1988 Country Squire Wagon, that had been furnished to SFH by Ford Motor Company for filming purposes.  These cars had been subject to water damage so, although they appeared to be in excellent condition, Ford would not sell or warranty them and instead furnished them to SFH to be used for special effects purposes.  In September of 1990, a jury returned a guilty verdict against Gleason on these two counts of receiving gratuities.  At his sentencing hearing, Gleason agreed to cooperate with the government in return for a recommendation by the government that he be sentenced to probation only.  He did in fact receive a sentence of probation.  Gleason testified before the grand jury and at trial as an immunized witness.  At trial, the information as to Gleason's guilty verdict, sentencing, and immunization was presented to the jury on direct examination.  This gave rise to defendant's second claim on appeal, that the lower court erred in permitting the government to introduce prior consistent statements of Gleason to Adams because it was the government, not the defendant, who first raised the issue of Gleason's credibility in its opening statement and in direct examination of Gleason.  Because we grant defendant's motion for acquittal, we do not reach this second issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant argues that several facts call Gleason's credibility, which is central to Loder's conviction, into question.  Gleason testified to consulting with a psychiatrist shortly after his conviction due to fear of being accused of something he did not do.  He further testified to taking a number of medications, due both to his psychiatric condition and to a back injury, which affected his memory, particularly with regard to dates.  Gleason denied ever using a counterfeit Massachusetts Police license plate on his car, but Adams and Belmont Police Detective John Trischetta testified to seeing a fake police plate on Gleason's car.  Finally, Gleason testified to obeying all terms and conditions of his federal parole, but on cross examination he conceded that he had been convicted of shoplifting while on federal parole, although no action had been taken against him by his probation officer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The specific language of the mail fraud statute is as follows:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

Accepting the trial judge's characterization of what the defendant would \"have to know,\" the requirement that the defendant share the specific criminal intent of the principal would still not be met.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
