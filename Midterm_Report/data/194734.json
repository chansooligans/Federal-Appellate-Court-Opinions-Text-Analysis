He based his argument on the present overcrowding in federal prisons and his past service to the community.

He argued that his family required his presence and support, that he had served his country in the army, that he had received commendations from work and that his conduct at prison was exemplary.  He also suggested that his sentence was excessive and not in line with the Sentencing Guidelines.  The court denied this motion on June 13, 1990.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; and (3) petitioner's due process rights had been violated because he was indicted only for perjury concerning testimony before the grand jury in 1986 when he had been asked the same questions and had given the same answers before a second grand jury in 1988.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; 2255 motion on January 23, 1992.  It held that a review of the sentencing hearing revealed that petitioner had had an adequate opportunity to object to the PSI.  Next, the court addressed petitioner's statement, written above his signature on the PSI, that he disagreed with some of the government's comments which, he claimed, had never been before the district court.  The court ruled that this was not a sufficiently particular charge that required the sentencing judge to make specific findings concerning disputed factual allegations.  As for his sentence, the court pointed out that it was within the limits set by law.  Finally, the court concluded that petitioner's due process claim was meritless.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; 2255 motion, filed on February 6, 1992 -- approximately two weeks after the dismissal of the second petition.  In this motion, petitioner claims that the district court violated his due process rights when it did not alter his sentence after we reversed his conviction on Count One.  He claims that testimony concerning this count \"permeated\" the entire trial and that sentencing was \"heavily weighted\" towards the conduct charged in Count One.  He acknowledges, however, that as the sentences were to run concurrently, the court did not necessarily have to change the length of his sentence.  Yet, he maintains, the stigma still remains.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Petitioner also asserts that his due process rights were violated when the prosecutor asked the defense witnesses about their knowledge concerning petitioner's temporary suspension from his job as a result of an alleged fraudulent insurance claim.  Petitioner avers that the insurance claim issue was irrelevant, erroneous and misleading.  The repeated use of this improper character evidence by the prosecutor, petitioner states, directly resulted in the finding of his guilt.  Thus, he concludes that the prosecutor's actions cannot be characterized as harmless error.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Petitioner's second and third grounds for relief are that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal.  First, he asserts that it was \"common knowledge\" at trial that counsel had Lyme's disease for which he was being treated.  The treatment included the use of antihistamines which, according to petitioner, can induce side effects such as cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and drowsiness.  This, he maintains, affected his attorney's performance.  Second, petitioner alleges that his trial counsel \"carelessly\" allowed the prosecutor to ask each defense witness about the \"misleading\" insurance issue.  Finally, petitioner asserts that trial counsel failed in his general duty to make sure that evidence of petitioner's good character was presented to the jury.  As for appellate counsel, petitioner charges that he, too, provided constitutionally defective assistance when he failed to file a timely motion for a new trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; 2255 motion.

Thus, once the government satisfies its burden by first pleading the existence of abuse of the writ, as it did here, the burden shifts to petitioner to establish cause for failing to raise in earlier habeas petitions the grounds presented in the subsequent petition and prejudice therefrom.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> at 1470.

He argued that his family required his presence and support, that he had served his country in the army, that he had received commendations from work and that his conduct at prison was exemplary.

It held that a review of the sentencing hearing revealed that petitioner had had an adequate opportunity to object to the PSI.  Next, the court addressed petitioner's statement, written above his signature on the PSI, that he disagreed with some of the government's comments which, he claimed, had never been before the district court.  The court ruled that this was not a sufficiently particular charge that required the sentencing judge to make specific findings concerning disputed factual allegations.  As for his sentence, the court pointed out that it was within the limits set by law.  Finally, the court concluded that petitioner's due process claim was meritless.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; 2255 motion, filed on February 6, 1992 -- approximately two weeks after the dismissal of the second petition.  In this motion, petitioner claims that the district court violated his due process rights when it did not alter his sentence after we reversed his conviction on Count One.  He claims that testimony concerning this count \"permeated\" the entire trial and that sentencing was \"heavily weighted\" towards the conduct charged in Count One.  He acknowledges, however, that as the sentences were to run concurrently, the court did not necessarily have to change the length of his sentence.  Yet, he maintains, the stigma still remains.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Petitioner also asserts that his due process rights were violated when the prosecutor asked the defense witnesses about their knowledge concerning petitioner's temporary suspension from his job as a result of an alleged fraudulent insurance claim.  Petitioner avers that the insurance claim issue was irrelevant, erroneous and misleading.  The repeated use of this improper character evidence by the prosecutor, petitioner states, directly resulted in the finding of his guilt.  Thus, he concludes that the prosecutor's actions cannot be characterized as harmless error.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Petitioner's second and third grounds for relief are that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal.  First, he asserts that it was \"common knowledge\" at trial that counsel had Lyme's disease for which he was being treated.  The treatment included the use of antihistamines which, according to petitioner, can induce side effects such as cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and drowsiness.  This, he maintains, affected his attorney's performance.  Second, petitioner alleges that his trial counsel \"carelessly\" allowed the prosecutor to ask each defense witness about the \"misleading\" insurance issue.  Finally, petitioner asserts that trial counsel failed in his general duty to make sure that evidence of petitioner's good character was presented to the jury.  As for appellate counsel, petitioner charges that he, too, provided constitutionally defective assistance when he failed to file a timely motion for a new trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi'; 2255 motion.

In </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">McCleskey</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">, the district court determined that the petitioner had not abused the writ when he filed his second federal habeas petition.

The </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">McCleskey</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> Court emphasized that this standard applies only to a \"narrow class of cases\" in which \"a constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of one innocent of the crime.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">  Petitioner must make a \"`colorable showing of factual innocence'\" to meet this test.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">i</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">d.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> at 1471 (quoting </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Kuhlmann</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Wilson</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111726\"><a href=\"/opinion/111726/kuhlmann-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 454 (1986)).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Although petitioner does not directly address this question, he generally argues that the use by the prosecutor of the alleged insurance fraud issue was \"prejudicial and devastating.\"  Further, petitioner suggests that when the government pursued Count One at trial, it was aware that the charge was time-barred.  By nonetheless presenting evidence concerning the 1979 examination, the government \"deliberately deceived the court and jury. . . .\"  It did so, according to petitioner, because \"this illegal charge was the only hope of prejudicing the jury to find [petitioner] guilty.\"  Without Count One, petitioner asserts, the government had no case and would have been forced to drop the other charges.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">This is insufficient to satisfy the miscarriage of justice standard.  Petitioner's claims that without Count One, there would have been no case and that, in any event, he would have been found not guilty, are allegations which are conclusory in nature.  Petitioner's characterizations and opinion of the government's case do not come close to a \"colorable showing of factual innocence.\"  Indeed, petitioner has not made, on direct appeal or in any of his motions, a sufficiency of the evidence claim.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">Andiarena</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier 10cpi';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585783\"><a href=\"/opinion/585783/oscar-andiarena-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 719 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).
