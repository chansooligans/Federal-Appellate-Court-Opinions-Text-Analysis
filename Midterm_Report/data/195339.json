On  February 6,\n                                          \n\n1989, Eric Clausen (\"Clausen\"),  plaintiff-appellee, slipped,\n\nfell, and injured his back while  working as a pile driver at\n\na  job site  at a  fuel terminal  facility on  the Piscataqua\n\nRiver,  Portsmouth  Harbor,  Newington,  New  Hampshire.    A\n\nMassachusetts  resident, Clausen  sued for  negligence, under\n\nthe  diversity jurisdiction,  in the  United States  District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire.  Defendants were the\n\nowner  of  the  facility,  Storage  Tank   Development  Corp.\n\n(\"Storage  Tank\"),  a  New  Hampshire  corporation,  and  the\n\noccupier  of the  facility,  Sea-3, Inc.  (\"Sea-3\"), a  Texas\n\ncorporation.  Defendants filed third-party complaints against\n\nClausen's employer, Goudreau Construction Corp. (\"Goudreau\").\n\n          Clausen's claims went to trial beginning on October\n\n5,  1992.   Storage  Tank's  and  Sea-3's third-party  claims\n\nagainst  Goudreau were omitted from  that trial.1  On October\n\n9,  1992, the jury  returned a  special verdict  in Clausen's\n\nfavor, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a), finding him to have\n\nbeen  damaged in the amount  of $1,426,000.2   On October 13,\n\n1992, the district court  entered judgment in accordance with\n\nthe  special verdict.   On  December 31,  1992, the  district\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district  court  ordered  a separate  trial  of  the\ndefendants' third-party  claims against Goudreau  pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 42(b).\n\n2.  Responding  to special  questions,  the jury  apportioned\nliability  against Storage Tank at 37.5%, Sea-3 at 37.5%, and\nGoudreau at 25%.\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt clarified its October 13, 1992,  judgment to hold Sea-3\n\nand  Storage Tank jointly and severally liable to Clausen for\n\n$1,426,000,  with prejudgment  interest  at the  rate of  ten\n\npercent (10%)  from the date of the  complaint to the date of\n\nthe  verdict, plus  costs.   On January  22, 1993,  Sea-3 and\n\nStorage  Tank  filed  separate  notices of  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict court's  December 31,  1992, amended judgment.3   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                    APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          Clausen  argues  that  we  do  not  have  appellate\n\njurisdiction over  Storage Tank's appeal because the district\n\ncourt's  December  31,  1992,  amended judgment  was  not  an\n\nappealable \"final decision\" as that term is used in 28 U.S.C.\n\n  1291 (1988).4  We trace the procedural history.\n\n          When  Storage Tank  filed its  notice of  appeal on\n\nJanuary  22, 1993,  from  the district  court's December  31,\n\n                    \n\n3.  On March  1, 1994, Sea-3 and Clausen reached a settlement\nagreement  in  which Sea-3  agreed  to  withdraw its  appeal.\nAccordingly, on March 7, 1994, we entered an order dismissing\nSea-3's appeal pursuant  to Fed.  R. App. P.  42(b).   Hence,\nStorage Tank remains the sole appellant. \n\n4.  28 U.S.C.   1291 (1988) states in pertinent part:\n\n          The courts of  appeals (other than  the United\n     States Court of  Appeals for  the Federal  Circuit)\n     shall have jurisdiction of  appeals from all  final\n                                                        \n     decisions of district courts of the United States .\n                                                      \n     . . .\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -4-\n\n1992,  amended  judgment,  its  own  unresolved,  third-party\n\nclaims were  still pending against Goudreau.   This situation\n\nwas problematic because a judgment\n\n     that  completely  disposes  of  . . . any  separate\n     claim  in  the  suit[,]  without disposing  of  the\n     third-party  claim,  is  not  appealable  unless  a\n     judgment is entered by the district court [pursuant\n     to  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.  54(b)5]   on  the  express\n     determination  that there  is  no just  reason  for\n     delay, and  an express  direction for the  entry of\n     judgment.\n\n6 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice   54.36 (2d\n                                                 \n\ned.  1993).   As the district  court had  not yet  entered an\n\nappealable judgment within Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b),  this court\n\nadvised Storage Tank, by order entered February 9, 1993, that\n\n\"[u]pon  review of the record  in this case,  it appears that\n\nthis court may not  have jurisdiction to consider the  appeal\n\nbecause  a third  party complaint . . . may  be outstanding.\"\n\nWe  directed  Storage  Tank  \"either to  move  for  voluntary\n\ndismissal under  Fed. R. App. P.  42(b) or to show  cause why\n\n[its] appeal should not be dismissed.\"  \n\n                    \n\n5.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) states in pertinent part:\n\n          When  more  than  one  claim  for  relief   is\n     presented  in  an  action,   whether  as  a  claim,\n     counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or\n     when multiple parties  are involved, the court  may\n     direct the entry of  a final judgment as to  one or\n     more but fewer  than all of  the claims or  parties\n     only upon an express determination that there is no\n     just reason for delay and upon an express direction\n     for the entry of judgment.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Following our February  9, 1993, show cause  order,\n\nClausen on February  19 moved the district court  to \"certify\n\n[pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)] that the judgment entered\n\non October 13 and amended on December 31, 1992[,] is a `final\n\njudgment'  and `that  there is  no just  reason for  delay.'\"\n\nStorage Tank  then moved this  court for  additional time  to\n\nrespond to our February 9, 1993, show cause order.  On  March\n\n4, 1993,  we granted  appellant's motion, extending  the time\n\nwithin which  Storage Tank could  respond to our  February 9,\n\n1993,  order until  March 23,  1993.  In  our March  4, 1993,\n\norder  we instructed  Storage Tank  that, \"[i]f  the district\n\ncourt  certifies its  [judgment]  as final  pursuant to  Rule\n\n54(b),  then,  in  order  to  avoid  any  . . . doubts  [over\n\njurisdiction], appellant[]  should file  [a] new  notice[] of\n\nappeal.\" \n\n          On March 31, 1993,  over objection by the appellant\n\nand after oral argument, the district court  entered an order\n\nin which it  found, pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b), \"that\n\nthe judgment entered on  December 31, 1992, in favor  of Eric\n\nClausen and  against Storage  Tank . . . is a  final judgment\n\nand  that there  is  no just  reason  for delaying  appellate\n\nreview.\"    Notwithstanding our  earlier  direction  that, to\n\navoid jurisdictional complications, Storage Tank submit a new\n\nnotice of appeal following the district court's Fed.  R. Civ.\n\n                             -6-\n\nP.  54(b)  certification,  Storage  Tank did  not  take  such\n\naction. \n\n          Clausen now contends that as Storage Tank's  notice\n\nof appeal    filed on January 22, 1993, more than  two months\n\nprior to the  district court's entry of  judgment pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)    was  premature, it should be treated\n\nas  a nullity.6  Clausen  is undoubtedly correct that Storage\n\nTank's  notice of  appeal  filed after  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n6.  Clausen cites Willhauck v. Halpin, 919 F.2d 788 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n1990),  for the proposition that \"a Notice of Appeal which is\npremature ``simply self-destructs'' and  should be treated as\na nullity.\"  Id. at 792 (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer\n                                                             \nDiscount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S. Ct. 400, 403, 74 L. Ed.\n            \n2d 225, 229 (1982)  (quoting 9 James W. Moore et al., Moore's\n                                                             \nFederal  Practice     204.12[1]  (1982))).    This  \"nullity\"\n                 \nprinciple,  however,  does  not  apply  to  this  case.    In\nWillhauck, unlike here, we dismissed the  plaintiffs' initial\n         \nappeal on the  merits of  the case for  want of  jurisdiction\nbecause \"the plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal from the\ndistrict  court's   denial  of  their  Motion   for  Judgment\nNotwithstanding the Verdict, or in the Alternative, for a New\nTrial, one day prior  to the lower court's entry  of judgment\non the Motion.\"  Id. at 790 n.2.  The fact that the  district\n                    \ncourt had not yet entered  judgment on motions filed pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50(b) and/or 59 when the Willhaucks filed\ntheir notice of appeal was dispositive because, under Fed. R.\nApp. P.  4(a)(4) (pre  1993 amendment),  a  notice of  appeal\n                                                             \nshall have no effect if it is filed before the disposition of\n                    \na motion\n\n     (i) for judgment under  Rule 50(b); (ii) under Rule\n     52(b) to amend or make additional findings of fact,\n     whether or not an  alteration of the judgment would\n     be required  if the motion is  granted; (iii) under\n     Rule  59 to  alter or amend  the judgment;  or (iv)\n     under Rule 59 for a new trial.\n\nSignificantly,  Fed. R.  App. P.  4(a)(4) does  not expressly\nnullify  a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) motion.\n\n                             -7-\n\nentry of its amended judgment, but before its Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n54(b) certification, was premature.  See, e.g., Tidler v. Eli\n                                                             \n\nLilly &amp; Co.,  824 F.2d 84, 85 (D.C. Cir.  1987).  The amended\n           \n\njudgment   was  unappealable   until   the   district   court\n\n\"direct[ed] the  entry of  a final  judgment .  .  . upon  an\n\nexpress determination that there is no just reason  for delay\n\nand upon  an express  direction for  the entry of  judgment.\"\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b).  This was eventually done, and we are\n\nat a loss as to why Storage Tank's  attorney failed to follow\n\nour  instruction to file a new notice of appeal following the\n\ndistrict  court's Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b)  certification.7  We\n\nconclude, nonetheless, that the prematurity of Storage Tank's\n\nnotice of appeal does not deprive us of jurisdiction over the\n\ncurrent appeal.\n\n          The  majority  of   circuits  that  have  addressed\n\njurisdictional quagmires similar to this one have held that a\n\nbelated  Fed.  R.  Civ.   P.  54(b)  certification  ripens  a\n\npremature   notice  of   appeal  as   of  the  date   of  the\n\ncertification.  See, e.g., United States v. Hardage, 982 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1491,  1494-95 (10th  Cir.  1993); Harrison  v.

Although Clausen argues  to the contrary,\n\nwe  believe  that the  district  court's  December 31,  1992,\n\namended judgment  was sufficiently a \"decision\"  for purposes\n\nof Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2). \n\n          In  FirsTier,  the petitioner  filed its  notice of\n                      \n\nappeal on  February 8,  1989, after  the  district court  had\n\nannounced  from  the  bench, on  January  26,  1989, that  it\n\nintended  to grant summary  judgment for the  respondent.  On\n\nMarch  3, 1989,  the district  court entered  judgment.   The\n\nquestion  addressed by  the  Court was  whether the  district\n\ncourt's bench ruling  was a \"decision\" under  Rule 4(a)(2) so\n\nthat the petitioner's premature notice of appeal would relate\n\nforward  to  the date  of  the  judgment, thereby  conferring\n\njurisdiction  upon the court of appeals.  In finding that the\n\nbench ruling  was a \"decision\"  under Rule 4(a)(2),  and that\n\nthe  court  of  appeals  had jurisdiction  to  entertain  the\n\nappeal, the Court held that \"Rule 4(a)(2) permits a notice of\n\nappeal from a  nonfinal decision  to operate as  a notice  of\n\nappeal  from the  final judgment only  when a  district court\n\nannounces a decision that  would be appealable if immediately\n                                   \n\nfollowed by  the entry of judgment.\"  Id. at 276 (emphasis in\n                                         \n\noriginal).  The Court  qualified this principle by explaining\n\n                             -11-\n\nthat Rule 4(a)(2) does not permit a \"notice of  appeal from a\n\nclearly interlocutory decision     such as a discovery ruling\n\nor a  sanction order under  Rule 11  of the Federal  Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure     to serve as  a notice of appeal  from the\n\nfinal judgment.\"  Id.\n                     \n\n          In  this case,  the district  court's December  31,\n\n1992,  amended judgment  was  not literally  a decision  that\n\nwould be appealable if immediately  followed by the entry  of\n\njudgment.   This is because,  with third-party claims  as yet\n\nunresolved, the  December 31, 1992, amended  judgment did not\n\ndispose of all the  claims in the case.   Therefore, judgment\n\ncould  not perfunctorily  be  entered  following  the  ruling\n          \n\nabsent the certification called for by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\nTo  certify,  the  district  court had  to  make  an  express\n\ndetermination  of no just reason for delay.  Only having done\n\nso was it  free to enter a  final judgment upon  its December\n\n31,  1992, amended judgment.   Thus,  the December  31, 1992,\n\namended judgment here does  not, at first blush, seem  to fit\n\nwithin  the  Court's language  in  FirsTier  and its  progeny\n                                           \n\nindicating  that a  decision  that would  be appealable  when\n\nimmediately followed  by the  entry of  judgment is  one that\n\n\"form[s]  the basis  of a  final judgment  without subsequent\n\nintervention by the district court.\"  Serine v. Peterson, 989\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 371,  373 (9th Cir. 1993); see Strasburg v. State Bar, 1\n                                                          \n\nF.3d 468, 472 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"Whereas the district court in\n\n                             -12-\n\nFirsTier  had  only ministerial  functions  left  to complete\n        \n\nafter announcing summary judgment, the district court's order\n\nhere  notified the  parties that  they should  expect further\n\ndispositive rulings by the court.\").\n\n          On the other hand,  the nonfinal December 31, 1992,\n\namended   judgment  in   this  case   was  not   irremediably\n\ninterlocutory as were the examples the Court used in FirsTier\n                                                             \n\nto describe rulings the premature  appeal from which Fed.  R.\n\nApp.  P.  4(a)(2) cannot  cure.   The  examples given  were a\n\ndiscovery ruling or  a sanction  order under Rule  11 of  the\n\nFederal  Rules of Civil Procedure.  There is no commonly used\n\nprocedure  for transforming  such interlocutory  rulings into\n\nappealable, final  dispositions, as Rule 54(b)  allows in the\n\ninstance of decisions that  dispose of some, but not  all, of\n\nthe claims in  a case.   Thus, the  district court's  amended\n\njudgment  in this  case falls  somewhere along  the continuum\n\nbetween an unalterably interlocutory decision, the notice  of\n\nappeal from which can never serve as a notice of appeal  from\n\nthe final judgment, FirsTier, 498 U.S.  at 276, and decisions\n                            \n\nthat would be appealable  under Rule 4(a)(2) when immediately\n\nfollowed  by  the entry  of  judgment.   We  ask,  therefore,\n\nwhether the district court's amended judgment is close enough\n\nto  a  \"decision  that  would be  appealable  if  immediately\n                                \n\nfollowed by the entry  of judgment,\" id., to be  a \"decision\"\n                                        \n\n                             -13-\n\nfor  purposes of  Fed.  R. App.  P. 4(a)(2).   Our  answer is\n\n\"Yes.\"9\n\n          The  district court's  December  31, 1992,  amended\n\njudgment bears  far more similarity to a  decision that would\n\nbe  appealable  if  immediately  followed  by  the  entry  of\n\njudgment than  to the purely interlocutory  decrees described\n\nin FirsTier.   Unlike these, the  December 31, 1992,  amended\n           \n\njudgment was a decision that purported to  dispose finally of\n\nall  of Clausen's claims against Storage Tank, if not all the\n\nclaims in the  lawsuit.   The decision  lacked finality  only\n\nbecause the district court had to find that there was no just\n\nreason  for delay  and certify  it as  appealable immediately\n\npursuant  to Fed. R. Civ.  P. 54(b).   Although this required\n\nthe district  court to make an  additional finding concerning\n\nthe appropriateness of an  immediate appeal, that finding did\n\nnot affect the substance or the scope of the amended judgment\n\nfrom which  the  premature appeal  was taken.   Rather,  once\n\nmade,  the district  court's  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 54(b)  ruling\n\ninstantly converted the substance of the former interlocutory\n\namended  judgment  into  a   wholly  appealable  one  without\n                                                             \n\nmodifying or enlarging that decision in any way.  \n                                               \n\n                    \n\n9.  FirsTier,  of  course, did  not involve  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n            \n54(b); hence, the Court should not necessarily be expected to\nhave anticipated the niceties of the present situation, which\nis sui generis.  \n              \n\n                             -14-\n\n          The  primary  difference between  the  December 31,\n\n1992,  decision in this case and the bench ruling in FirsTier\n                                                             \n\nwas  that the  district  court here  could not  perfunctorily\n\nenter  judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.  58.  Rather, it had to\n\nsatisfy itself and certify that  the decision was, in effect,\n\nappropriate for immediate appeal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n54(b), notwithstanding its failure to resolve all claims made\n\nin  the lawsuit.10   This difference, however,  does not make\n\nthe district  court's December 31, 1992,  amended judgment so\n\ndissimilar from the district court's bench ruling in FirsTier\n                                                             \n\nthat Storage Tank  should lose the protection of  the savings\n\nclause of  Fed. R. App.  P. 4(a)(2).  In  both instances, the\n\nprematurely-appealed decisions  remained absolutely unaltered\n\nto and through entry of an appealable judgment.    \n\n          Consequently, we  hold that,  by virtue of  Fed. R.\n\nApp. P.  4(a)(2), Storage  Tank's premature notice  of appeal\n\nripened when  the district  court certified its  December 31,\n\n1992, amended judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  As\n\nwe  have appellate jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of the\n\nappeal.\n\n                             II.\n\n                    \n\n10.  It could be said  that, for the purposes of Fed. R. App.\nP. 4(a)(2), a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification  plays the\nsame role as entry of judgment under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 58.  In\nother  words, \"entry of judgment,\" as  that phrase appears in\nFed.  R. App. P. 4(a)(2),  encompasses Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b)\ncertifications.\n\n                             -15-\n\n                         BACKGROUND \n\n          Storage  Tank  owns  docking  facilities  along the\n\nPiscataqua River in Newington,  New Hampshire.  These include\n\na  walkway-pier that  first extends perpendicularly  from the\n\nshore line into the  water, and then turns ninety  degrees to\n\nthe  left and  extends  upstream.   A concrete  mooring cell,\n\nreferred to as Cell Three, is located in the water beyond the\n\nend  of the  walkway-pier.11   Cell  Three,  at the  time  of\n\nClausen's injury,  was connected to  the end of  the walkway-\n\npier  by the ramp upon  which Clausen slipped  and fell.  The\n\nramp sloped downward to Cell Three from the walkway-pier.  In\n\nApril 1992, the ramp was replaced by Storage Tank, at Sea-3's\n\nrequest,  with a set of  steps because the  concrete cell cap\n\nhad settled.\n\n          Sea-3  imports  and distributes  petroleum products\n\nthroughout New England.   At all material times, Sea-3  had a\n\nfirst-priority  contractual  right,  under  a  so-called Dock\n\nAgreement with  Storage Tank, to  occupy and use  the docking\n\nfacilities.  In  1983, Sea-3  sought to  improve the  docking\n\nfacilities by making structural changes to Cell Three.  Sea-3\n\ncontracted with Goudreau  to perform the work.   Storage Tank\n\nwas not a party to that contract.\n\n                    \n\n11.  The  mooring cells  were filled  with gravel  and capped\nwith  concrete  to  provide  support  for  the  dolphins  and\nbollards upon which vessels attached their mooring lines.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          On February 5, 1989, Goudreau hired Clausen to work\n\non Cell Three as a  pile driver.  Clausen's first day  on the\n\njob was February  6, 1989,  the day he  suffered his  injury.\n\nWhen  Clausen arrived  at the job  site at  7:00 a.m.  on the\n\nmorning of February 6, 1989, it was snowing.  Between one and\n\ntwo inches of fresh  snow had accumulated on the dock.   Upon\n\nreceiving  permission   to  begin   work,  Clausen   and  his\n\ncoworkers,  Daniel  Woundy,  William  Burroughs,  and Kenneth\n\nKing,  the foreman, proceeded  down the  walkway-pier towards\n\nCell Three.  Prior to the group's arrival at Cell Three, King\n\ninstructed  Clausen to go back and retrieve an air compressor\n\nhose  that was stored in a guardhouse.  Clausen retrieved the\n\nair compressor hose  and then headed  back down the  walkway-\n\npier toward the ramp that  connected the walkway-pier to Cell\n\nThree.  Somewhere along the ramp that connected  the walkway-\n\npier to Cell  Three, Clausen slipped,  fell, and injured  his\n\nback.   \n\n          Immediately  after  the  fall, Clausen  experienced\n\npain  that radiated down his back to  his ankle.  Despite the\n\npain, Clausen continued to work until his lunch break.  After\n\nlunch,  Clausen was in too much pain to continue working, and\n\nhe decided  to go home for  the day.  Upon  arriving at home,\n\nClausen  immediately made an  appointment with a chiropractor\n\nfor 3:00 p.m. that afternoon.\n\n                             -17-\n\n          For   approximately   eight  weeks   following  the\n\naccident, Clausen  was treated  by his chiropractor.   A  CAT\n\nscan taken two months after the accident revealed a herniated\n\ndisk at the L5-S1 level.  Consequently, Clausen was  referred\n\nto  Dr. Gerwin  Neumann, a  neurosurgeon at  the New  England\n\nBaptist  Hospital.  After confirming the  diagnosis of a disk\n\nherniation in L5-S1,  Dr. Neumann, in May 1989, performed the\n\nfirst of  what would eventually be  five operations performed\n\non various disks in Clausen's back.\n\n          At  trial,   Clausen,  the  only   witness  to  the\n\naccident,  testified  that the  ramp  on  which  he fell  was\n\nconstructed of  what looked  like two-inch thick  by ten-inch\n\nwide \"staging  planks\" that were joined together  by a couple\n\nof slats.  Clausen further testified that the ramp was ten to\n\ntwelve  feet  long and  was covered  by  snow.   According to\n\nClausen,  the ramp protruded up  over the walkway-pier by ten\n\nto twelve inches so  that he had to step up onto  the ramp in\n\norder  to proceed  down to  Cell Three.   Clausen's testimony\n\nrevealed  that he initially stepped up onto the ramp with his\n\nleft foot.  He did  not have his hand on the  railing because\n\nit did  not come up high enough for him to reach it.  Clausen\n\nthen lifted  his right foot  off the  ground, and, as  he was\n\nabout to place it on  the ramp, his left foot slipped  and he\n\nstarted  to fall.   Clausen  testified that,  as he  fell, he\n\ntwisted to the right and twisted back to the left and grabbed\n\n                             -18-\n\nonto  the railing with his right  hand as he was coming down.\n\nThen  he hit  the ramp.   At that point,  Clausen was holding\n\nonto  the railing and had one hand  on the ramp.  He then let\n\nhimself go and slid down the ramp the rest of the way to Cell\n\nThree.  According  to Clausen's trial testimony,  once he got\n\nto the bottom, he looked back up and saw a sheet of ice about\n\none-half inch thick covering the ramp from top to bottom.12\n\n          Based on Clausen's testimony, the defendants argued\n\nat trial  that Clausen had actually slipped on staging planks\n\nthat had been placed by Goudreau  employees over the existing\n\nramp that  connected  the walkway-pier  to  Cell Three.    No\n\nwitness testified  at trial, however, to  having seen staging\n\nplanks  placed over  the ramp.   To  the contrary,  there was\n\n                    \n\n12.  Clausen's  trial  testimony  did  not  comport  with his\nearlier answers  to interrogatories  with regard to  where he\nslipped and fell on the ramp.  In response to interrogatories\nthat  inquired about  how and  where  his fall  had occurred,\nClausen did not state that he slipped as he stepped onto  the\nramp, but  rather answered  that \"[t]he incident  occurred at\nthe junction of the concrete cell and  a gangplank connecting\nthe cell to the pier\" and that \"[a]s [he] was moving from the\ngangplank to the cell,  [he] was suddenly caused to  slip and\nfall.\"  \n\n     Clausen's trial testimony  was consistent, however, with\nprevious deposition testimony in which he stated:\n\n     So as I stepped up with  my left foot and I went to\n     reach  for [the rail],  I brought my  right foot up\n     and  that's when I slipped and fell.  And I twisted\n     my  back and as I  came back around,  that's when I\n     grabbed ahold of  the railing and I  just fell down\n     on my backside.\n\n                             -19-\n\ntestimony that the ramp  was \"fixed\" between the walkway-pier\n\nand  Cell Three  and that  it did  not  protrude up  over the\n\nwalkway-pier, but was \"flush\" with it so that one had to step\n\ndown onto the  ramp when walking  to Cell Three.   There  was\n\nfurther testimony  that the  ramp had  cleats or  treads, ten\n\ninches  to one foot apart,  running crosswise all  the way up\n\nthe length of the ramp.  The ramp itself, according to  trial\n\nwitnesses,  was approximately  five  feet wide  by five  feet\n\nlong.\n\n          Clausen also  testified at trial that  he still had\n\nback  pain  that radiated  down his  left  leg.   Dr. Neumann\n\ntestified that there was a direct causal relationship between\n\nthe accident on the ramp and Clausen's herniated disks, which\n\nrequired  five operations  to repair.   He  further testified\n\nthat Clausen can lift  no more than fifteen to  twenty pounds\n\nand  is totally  disabled from  a strenuous  job.   He noted,\n\nhowever,  that,  if  Clausen's  medical  condition  were   to\n\nstabilize, he could engage in sedentary or clerical activity.\n\n          To  establish  damages  at  trial,  Clausen  called\n\nRobert  Doucette,  an  expert  economist,  to  testify  about\n\nClausen's loss  of earning  capacity.   Doucette said  he had\n\nexamined Clausen's tax  returns, copies  of union  contracts,\n\nmedical  records, and  statistical information  pertaining to\n\nwork-life expectancy.   He  testified that he  used Clausen's\n\nunion  contract to calculate Clausen's  base wage rate at the\n\n                             -20-\n\ntime  of his injury.   In reliance on  the contract, Doucette\n\nconcluded that  Clausen was  earning a gross  hourly wage  of\n\n$18.45 when  the accident  occurred.   He then  adjusted this\n\nfigure  upward to  $23.85 per hour  to account  for Clausen's\n\nfringe benefits  under the union contract,  which included an\n\nannuity fund,  a pension fund,  and health  insurance.   From\n\nthese  preliminary figures,  Doucette concluded  that it  was\n\nreasonable  to  anticipate  that  Clausen would  have  earned\n\napproximately  $875,000  in  gross  wages  and   $391,000  in\n\nbenefits from the  time he was  injured, at age  thirty-four,\n\nthrough the age of his work-life expectancy.13\n\n          Doucette   adjusted   these   gross    figures   by\n\nsubtracting  income  taxes,  adding   the  average  value  of\n\nhousehold  services at minimum wage, and adding a lump sum to\n\nmeet income tax liability on interest earnings.  After making\n\nthese adjustments, Doucette concluded that the  present value\n\nof Clausen's  earning  capacity on  the  date of  his  injury\n\ntotaled approximately $1,250,000.  He explained that this sum\n\nrepresents the  amount of  economic value that  Clausen could\n\nhave been expected to produce if he had not been injured, and\n\nany pecuniary damages attributable  to the injury is measured\n\n                    \n\n13.  According to Doucette, work-life expectancy expresses an\naverage of  how long a  person may be  expected to be  in the\nlabor force earning income.   It is a function  of a person's\nage, sex, level of education, and activity level.\n\n                             -21-\n\nby  the difference  between  $1,250,000 and  what Clausen  is\n\nstill able to earn in the future. \n\n                             III.\n\n          Storage  Tank contends that the district court made\n\nerrors  both during trial and after trial.  Among the former,\n\nStorage Tank  alleges mistaken  evidentiary rulings  and jury\n\ninstructions.  It argues that the district court erred in (1)\n\nallowing evidence of subsequent remedial  measures undertaken\n\non  the ramp  where  Clausen slipped  and  fell, (2)  denying\n\nStorage  Tank's  counsel  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine\n\nClausen's  economist,  Doucette,  on  the  subject  of  union\n\nbenefits that  Clausen allegedly received after the accident,\n\nand  (3)  instructing  the   jury  to  assess  fault  against\n\nGoudreau, a non-party to the trial.  In the category of post-\n\ntrial error, Storage Tank objects to the district court's (1)\n\nrefusal to file its  Renewed Motion for Judgment as  a Matter\n\nof Law,  (2) denial of its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of\n\nLaw,  and (3)  denial of  its  Motion to  Alter or  Amend the\n\nJudgment.\n\n          We find merit in none of these arguments.\n\nA.   Alleged Trial Errors\n\n     1.   Evidence of Subsequent Remedial Measures\n                                                  \n\n          Storage Tank complains of the allowance of evidence\n\nthat,  in 1992, Storage Tank, at  Sea-3's request, replaced a\n\nramp on which  Clausen fell with  a set of  steps.  Prior  to\n\n                             -22-\n\ntrial, Storage Tank had  filed a motion in limine  seeking to\n\nexclude evidence  of the changes made to the ramp both on the\n\nissues of negligence and control.  Storage Tank argued in its\n\nmotion that  evidence  of  subsequent  remedial  measures  is\n\ninadmissible  under Fed.  R. Evid.  40714 to  prove negligent\n\nor culpable conduct.  It also contended that,  although there\n\nwas  an unresolved issue in  the case about whether Goudreau,\n\nStorage  Tank,  Sea-3,  or  some  combination  of  the  three\n\ncontrolled the area where  Clausen fell, the evidence of  the\n\nramp's replacement  in this case carried  no probative weight\n\nwith  regard to the control issue.  The district court denied\n\nStorage Tank's motion in limine, but limited the scope of the\n\nevidence to  the issue of who had control over the area where\n\nClausen's  injury occurred.   At  the end  of the  trial, the\n\ndistrict  court gave the jury a  limiting instruction to this\n\neffect.\n\n                    \n\n14.  Fed. R. Evid. 407 states:\n\n          When,  after  an  event,  measures  are  taken\n     which, if  taken  previously, would  have made  the\n     event  less  likely  to   occur,  evidence  of  the\n     subsequent  measures  is  not admissible  to  prove\n     negligence  or culpable conduct  in connection with\n     the  event.    This   rule  does  not  require  the\n                                                        \n     exclusion of  evidence of subsequent  measures when\n                                                        \n     offered  for  another  purpose,  such   as  proving\n                                                        \n     ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary\n                                                        \n     measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\n                                               \n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -23-\n\n          On appeal, Storage  Tank insists that the  district\n\ncourt  should not have allowed Clausen to introduce  evidence\n\nof the replacement of the ramp under the control exception to\n\nFed. R.  Evid. 407.  It contends  that the probative value of\n\nthe evidence  was \"substantially outweighed by  the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of  the issues, or misleading the\n\njury.\"    Fed. R.  Evid.  403.15   Clausen  asserts, however,\n\nthat  we need not reach the merits of Storage Tank's argument\n\nbecause  it did not preserve  the issue for  appeal by timely\n\nobjecting  at trial to the  admission of the  evidence of the\n\nramp's replacement.  We agree.\n\n          During  the  charging  conference,   the  following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n     Mr. Clinton:   First  of  all,   your  Honor,   the\n     remedial  instruction with  regard to the  issue of\n     control  of the  stairs  in 1992  was only  for the\n     purpose of control.\n\n     The Court:     In other words, you admitted it only\n     for the  purpose of control and  not for liability?\n     When it came in, there was no objection.  I was    \n\n     Mr. Clinton:   Well, I objected.\n\n                    \n\n15.  Fed. R. Evid. 403, in full, states:\n\n          Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if\n     its probative value is substantially  outweighed by\n     the  danger of unfair  prejudice, confusion  of the\n     issues,   or    misleading   the   jury,    or   by\n     considerations of  undue delay, waste  of time,  or\n     needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -24-\n\n     The Court:     When?  Not when it  was offered, not\n     when it came in.  I'll be glad to put in  something\n     like that, but I was sitting here waiting    \n\n     Mr. Clinton:   I filed  a motion in  limine instead\n     of repeating.  You denied the motion  in limine, so\n     I figured you ruled.\n\n     The Court:     But when no objection came, I didn't\n     know  at that  point whether  you had  changed your\n     position or what. . . .\n\nFrom this colloquy,  it appears that  Storage Tank felt  that\n\nthe district court's earlier denial  of its motion in  limine\n\nhad relieved it of any need to object to the admission of the\n\nevidence  of the subsequent repair at the time it was offered\n\nat trial. \n\n          In United  States v.  Reed, 977  F.2d 14  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992), we said that \"[a] motion in limine without subsequent,\n                                         \n\ncontemporaneous  objection  at trial,  .  .  . is  ordinarily\n\ninsufficient to preserve  an evidentiary ruling for  appeal.\"\n\nId. at 17 (citing Fed. R.  Evid. 103(a)).  More recently,  we\n   \n\nexpanded upon this general proposition by holding:\n\n          Where  an  objection   to  evidence  has  been\n     overruled in limine, it makes sense to require that\n     the  objection   be  renewed  at  trial.    However\n     definite the denial of  the motion to exclude prior\n     to  trial, it is  child's play for  the opponent of\n     the  evidence  to  renew  the  objection  when  the\n     evidence  is actually  offered; and  requiring this\n     renewal   gives  the   trial  judge  a   chance  to\n     reconsider  the ruling  with the  concrete evidence\n     presented in the actual context of the trial.\n\nFusco v.

As the Fifth  Circuit explained in\n\nCollins v.

When a\n     party files numerous  motions in limine,  the trial\n     court  may not  pay  close attention  to each  one,\n     believing   that   many   of   them    are   purely\n     hypothetical.  Thus, a party whose motion in limine\n     has been  overruled must  object when the  error he\n     sought to prevent with his motion is about to occur\n     at  trial.   This  will  give  the trial  court  an\n     opportunity to reconsider the grounds of the motion\n     in    light    of     the    actual  instead     of\n     hypothetical  circumstances at trial.\n\nId. at 784.

It  is utterly  clear  that the  district court's\n\ndecision  to permit the evidence  of the changes  made to the\n\nramp in 1992, whether right or wrong, was not plain error.\n\n          Although Fed. R. Evid. 407 proscribes the admission\n\nof   evidence  of  subsequent  remedial  measures  to  \"prove\n\n                             -27-\n\nnegligence or culpable conduct,\"  it allows such evidence, as\n\nalready  noted, \"when  offered for  another purpose,  such as\n\nproving .  . .  control.\"   Fed. R. Evid.  407.   The parties\n\nagree that control  of the ramp  area where Clausen's  injury\n\noccurred was a material issue in this case.  According to the\n\nappellant, one aspect of the control issue arose because both\n\nStorage Tank and  Sea-3 asserted that Goudreau was in control\n\nof the work site and was, therefore, responsible for clearing\n\nand  sanding the  area  where the  plaintiff  fell.   Clausen\n\npoints  out that a second aspect of the control issue in this\n\ncase,  not  alluded  to  by Storage  Tank,  involved  whether\n\nStorage  Tank, Sea-3,  or both  jointly, controlled  the area\n\nwhere Clausen fell if Goudreau, at that time, did not control\n\nthe ramp.16\n\n          To be  sure, Storage Tank argues  that the evidence\n\nthat  it made  changes to  the ramp  at the request  of Sea-3\n\nsubsequent to  Clausen's accident was  inadmissible under the\n\n                    \n\n16.  The  trial judge's  summary of  the control  issue sheds\nadditional light on the parties' arguments:\n\n     As  I understand  it,  and as  I'm putting  it, the\n     defendants,  one, deny that  there was an accident,\n     two, they say  if there was  an accident, each  one\n     denies that  it was responsible  and maintains that\n     any  fault  was that  either  of  the plaintiff  or\n     Goudreau or both, and to each one there's an  issue\n     as to who was  in control of the premises.   You're\n                                                        \n     not  in agreement  on that,  although you  both say\n                                                        \n     that Goudreau  was in control of  the premises, but\n                                                        \n     if not, then who was?\n                          \n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -28-\n\ncontrol exception to Fed.  R. Evid. 407 because  the evidence\n\nfailed  to satisfy  the independent  requirements of  Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403.  Storage Tank maintains that, because the ramp was\n\nreplaced in 1992,  approximately three years  after Clausen's\n\nfall, the evidence  is not probative of  whether Storage Tank\n\nor Sea-3  controlled the ramp, either  separately or jointly,\n\nin 1989,  particularly since, according to  Storage Tank, the\n\narea had been exclusively occupied by Goudreau when Clausen's\n\ninjury occurred.  Whatever can be said for such arguments had\n\nStorage Tank preserved its right to argue the merits, they do\n\nnot come close to  demonstrating that it was plain  error for\n\nthe district  court to believe  that the evidence  carried at\n\nleast  some probative weight as to who controlled the ramp in\n\n1989.\n\n          Storage  Tank  also suggests  that  it  was greatly\n\nprejudiced because the jury may have used the evidence of the\n\nramp's  replacement  for an  improper  purpose.   The  judge,\n\nhowever,  instructed  the   jury  that  \"[e]vidence   of  the\n\nsubsequent  installation   of  stairs  in  1992  is  evidence\n\nrelevant  only on  the issue  of control.   It  is not  to be\n\nconsidered evidence of liability or fault.\"  According to the\n\nadvisory  committee's  notes  to  Fed. R.  Evid.  403,  \"[i]n\n\nreaching a decision  whether to exclude on  grounds of unfair\n\nprejudice,  consideration should  be  given to  the  probable\n\neffectiveness  or  lack   of  effectiveness  of   a  limiting\n\n                             -29-\n\ninstruction.\"  Although limiting instructions  may not always\n\nbe effective,  see, e.g.,  United States v.

Cross-Examination of Clausen's Expert, Doucette\n                                                         \n\n          At  trial,  Clausen  testified  that,  as  a  union\n\nmember,  he  had   enjoyed  certain  union  employee   fringe\n\nbenefits, including a  pension plan, an  annuity fund, and  a\n\n\"health and welfare dental plan.\"   Clausen did not  mention,\n\nin  this   regard,  workers'  compensation   payments,  union\n\ndisability  benefits, or social security disability benefits.\n\nLater  in the  trial, Clausen's  expert, Doucette,  estimated\n\nClausen's  pecuniary damages  (i.e.,  lost future  earnings),\n                                   \n\nincluding  wages  and fringe  benefits  lost  because of  his\n\ninability to  perform his former  job due to the  injury.  In\n\ndetermining this figure, Doucette testified that Clausen,  at\n\nthe time  of his injury, had  earned \"a gross hourly  wage of\n\n                             -30-\n\n$18.45  per hour.\"  He  also testified that  Clausen had then\n\nenjoyed  fringe benefits    consisting of \"an annuity fund, a\n\npension  fund,  and  health  and  welfare,  which  is  health\n\ninsurance\"     the  gross future  value of  which, calculated\n\nfrom  the time of Clausen's  injury through his  age of work-\n\nlife expectancy, totaled $391,000.   Doucette did not mention\n\nworkers' compensation payments, union disability benefits, or\n\nsocial security disability benefits.\n\n          Prior  to  cross-examining  Doucette,  counsel  for\n\nStorage Tank requested \n\n     a  ruling that [he] be allowed on cross-examination\n     to go into the  union benefits, such as [Clausen's]\n                                                        \n     disability benefits that  he's currently  receiving\n                                                        \n     and  any Social Security  benefits, since they have\n                                                        \n     opened it up by bringing it in as being factors.\n                                                    \n\n(emphasis added).  Counsel  for Clausen strenuously objected,\n\nsaying  the   mentioned  evidence   had  gone  \"only   as  to\n\n[Clausen's] earnings,\" there being \"nothing said with respect\n\nto [Clausen]  being economically  deprived now because  of no\n\nmoney  or  anything  like that.\"    After  hearing  from both\n\nparties,  the  court  denied  Storage  Tank's  request.    In\n\nresponse, Storage Tank's counsel made an offer of proof: \n\n     Note  my exception,  your Honor,  but on  the basis\n     this is the collateral  [source rule].  He's raised\n     the  issue.   This is  an offer.   He's  raised the\n     [issue] of  fringe benefits  under unions and  he's\n     currently receiving disability benefits.\n\n          The  district court  denied Storage  Tank's request\n\nundoubtedly  because of  New  Hampshire's  collateral  source\n\n                             -31-\n\nrule,17   which   provides  that   \"a   plaintiff   [who]  is\n\ncompensated  in  whole or  in part  for  his damages  by some\n\nsource  independent  of  the  tort-feasor  .  .  .  is  still\n\npermitted  to make  full recovery against  him.\"   Moulton v.\n                                                          \n\nGroveton Papers Co.,  114 N.H.  505, 509, 323  A.2d 906,  909\n                   \n\n(1974).

The  Supreme  Court  of  New  Hampshire  has\nsummarized these rationales as follows:\n\n     The   basic  argument  advanced  for  [the  rule's]\n     application is  that a  tort-feasor  should not  be\n     allowed to escape the consequences  of his wrongful\n     act  merely  because  his  victim  has  received  a\n     benefit  from  a   collateral  source  which  would\n     constitute  a windfall to  the defendant wrongdoer.\n     It is  also pointed out that in  many instances the\n     plaintiff has  paid for these benefits  in the form\n     of insurance premiums  or concessions in  the wages\n     he received  because of  such fringe benefits.   If\n     such  considerations   are  not  present   and  the\n     payments are gratuitous, it is maintained  that the\n     maker of  these payments did not  intend to relieve\n     the tort-feasor of any liability, but rather to aid\n     the plaintiff  by doing him a  favor. . . .   It is\n     also  argued  that the  collateral  source rule  is\n     designed  to  offset   the  inability  of  ordinary\n     damages   to   adequately  compensate   an  injured\n     accident victim.\n\nMoulton v.

We do not\n\nagree.   Storage Tank's  counsel sought permission  to cross-\n\nexamine Doucette as to \"disability benefits that [Clausen] is\n\ncurrently receiving and any Social Security benefits.\"  These\n\nwere not the benefits Clausen and Doucette had testified were\n\nlost  by reason  of  Clausen's injury     Doucette  mentioned\n\nClausen's loss  of  \"an annuity  fund,  a pension  fund,  and\n\nhealth and welfare, which is health insurance.\"  The district\n\ncourt  had  good  reason  to  think  that  Storage  Tank  was\n\nproposing to  delve into  different contemporary  benefits in\n                                   \n\norder to persuade the jury to reduce its damages award by the\n\namount  of  collateral  payments  that were  currently  being\n\nreceived  from  other  sources  by  the  disabled  plaintiff.\n\nPreventing such  inquiry was consistent  with New Hampshire's\n\ncollateral source  rule.    If Storage  Tank  had  wished  to\n\n                             -35-\n\nexamine  Doucette  on  the  accuracy of  his  projections  of\n\nClausen's economic loss relative to the annuity fund, pension\n\nfund, and health insurance,  it needed to say so,  see infra,\n                                                            \n\nrather than  merely saying  it wanted to  cross-examine about\n\ndisability  and social  security benefits  now being  paid to\n\nClausen.  \n\n          Storage  Tank's reliance  on Haskins  is misplaced.\n                                              \n\nIn  Haskins,  the  plaintiff,  on   direct  examination,  had\n           \n\ntestified  that  certain medical  bills  had  been paid  from\n\ncollateral  sources, namely,  Blue  Cross, Blue  Shield,  and\n\nMedicaid.     The  district  court  allowed  the  defendant's\n\nattorney to \"elicit[] further information concerning the type\n\nand scope  of the collateral source payments.\"   Haskins, 612\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 375.   Here, by contrast, Clausen and  Doucette never\n\ntestified  that  Clausen   was  receiving  collateral  source\n\npayments  (e.g.,  workers'  compensation,   union  disability\n               \n\nbenefits, or  social security disability  benefits).  Rather,\n\nthey  testified  that Clausen  had  permanently lost  certain\n\nemployee  benefits  by  reason  of his  accident  (i.e.,  \"an\n                                                       \n\nannuity  fund, a pension fund, and health and welfare\").  The\n\ndistrict  court  could  reasonably  believe  that  Doucette's\n\ntestimony   concerning  the  purported  value  of  particular\n\nbenefits  that  Clausen had  allegedly  lost  because of  his\n\ninjury  did   not  \"open  the   door\"  to   cross-examination\n\n                             -36-\n\nconcerning  the  receipt by  Clausen of  what appeared  to be\n\ndifferent benefits.19   \n\n          We recognize  that there  is some force  to Storage\n\nTank's  argument, relying on Lange, that, notwithstanding the\n                                  \n\ncollateral  source  rule,  it was  entitled  to cross-examine\n\nDoucette regarding  Clausen's receipt of  disability benefits\n\nto show that  Clausen had not actually lost employee benefits\n\nas indicated by Doucette on direct examination.  In this same\n\nvein,  Storage  Tank asserts  that,  had  the district  court\n\npermitted it to demonstrate on cross-examination that Clausen\n\nhad not  lost his  employee benefits, it  would have  thereby\n\nimpeached  Doucette's credibility.    We need  not reach  the\n\nmerits  of these  arguments,  however,  because Storage  Tank\n\nraises them for the first time on appeal. \n\n          We have held that \"[a] party may not claim error on\n\nappeal in the exclusion of evidence unless the district court\n\nwas told not only  what the party intended to prove  but also\n\nfor what purpose.\"   Tate v.

Specifically, counsel for Sea-3 argued to the district\n\ncourt that \"we should  not have Goudreau Corporation, because\n\nthey're  not a party to this case,  and . . . to include them\n\nwould  confuse the  jury  with respect  to finding  liability\n\nagainst  a party that's not here.\"  Counsel for Sea-3 further\n\nasserted that  \"[m]y concern is  that we have  an [indemnity]\n\naction against Goudreau . . . [a]nd I don't want this  jury's\n\nfinding to be on  that process [sic], and, hence, I object to\n\nits presence  here.\"  Counsel for Storage Tank neither joined\n\nin   Sea-3's  objection  nor  expressed  any  dissatisfaction\n\nwhatsoever  with the  inclusion  of Goudreau  in the  special\n\nverdict questions.\n\n          Counsel  for Sea-3  again raised  his objection  to\n\nGoudreau's inclusion  in the  special verdict  questions just\n\nprior  to  the  district court's  charge  to  the  jury.   He\n\nmaintained  that his  only problem  with the  special verdict\n\nquestions  was  \"the inclusion  of  Goudreau.\"   Counsel  for\n\nStorage  Tank,  on the  other hand,  stated  that he  had \"no\n\nproblem\" with the special  verdict questions and that  he had\n\n\"no objection\" to the  instructions.  Notwithstanding Sea-3's\n\nobjection, the  district court did not  exclude Goudreau from\n\nthe special  verdict questions, which were given  to the jury\n\nin nearly  identical form  to the  Joint Request  for Special\n\nJury Questions submitted previously by the parties.   \n\n                             -40-\n\n          On appeal, Storage  Tank argues  that the  district\n\ncourt  committed reversible  error  by allowing  the jury  to\n\nassign liability to Goudreau because Goudreau was not a party\n\ndefendant  at trial.  It contends that the district court, by\n\nallowing  the  jury  to  apportion  fault  against  Goudreau,\n\nviolated  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    507:7-e, I(a) (1986), which\n\norders  the trial court to  \"[i]nstruct the jury to determine\n\n. . . the  amount of damages  to be awarded  to each claimant\n\nand  against   each   defendant  in   accordance   with   the\n\nproportionate fault of  each of the  parties.\"  Storage  Tank\n\ninterprets  this statute to mean that it is impermissible for\n\na  trial court to instruct  a jury to  find the proportionate\n\nfault of a non-party.   In this context, Storage  Tank argues\n\nthat Goudreau was not a party in its trial with Clausen, and,\n\ntherefore, the district court, by virtue of    507:7-e, I(a),\n\nerred  by instructing  the  jury to  apportion fault  against\n\nGoudreau.\n\n          Clausen   counters   Storage  Tank's   argument  by\n\nasserting that Storage Tank failed to preserve for appeal the\n\nissue that the district  court did not comply with  N.H. Rev.\n\nStat.  Ann.   507:7-e, I(a).  He points out that Storage Tank\n\nnot only  asked that Goudreau be included  in special verdict\n\nquestions  in the  parties'  Joint Request  for Special  Jury\n\nQuestions,  but also failed to object  to the special verdict\n\nquestions at any time during trial.  We agree with Clausen.\n\n                             -41-\n\n          Fed. R. Civ.

Alleged Post-Trial Errors\n\n     1.   Refusal to File  Storage Tank's Renewed  Motion for\n                                                             \n          Judgment as a  Matter of Law and  Denial of Storage\n                                                             \n          Tank's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                                                       \n\n          At the end of evidence, Storage Tank filed a Motion\n\nfor Judgment as  a Matter  of Law, which  the district  court\n\n                    \n\n20.  The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has not addressed the\nissue and it  is unclear,  insofar as we  are aware,  whether\nthird-party defendants, who are not involved in the immediate\ntrial involving  the plaintiff  and the defendant(s),  are or\nare not \"parties\"  as that  term appears in  N.H. Rev.  Stat.\nAnn.   507:7-e.    \n\n                             -43-\n\ndenied.  Within ten days after the entry of judgment, Storage\n\nTank  filed, pursuant  to Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 50(b),  a Renewed\n\nMotion for Judgment  as a Matter of Law.   The district court\n\nrefused to file the later motion because it failed to include\n\na certificate  of compliance with  U.S. Dist. Ct.  R., D.N.H.\n\n11(b).21   On appeal, Storage  Tank assigns error  to both of\n\nthese decisions. \n\n          a.   Refusal to File Storage Tank's  Renewed Motion\n                                                             \n               for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                                              \n\n          Storage  Tank initially contends  that the district\n\ncourt erred  in  refusing  to  file its  Renewed  Motion  for\n\nJudgment as a Matter  of Law for failure to comply  with U.S.\n\nDist.  Ct. R., D.N.H 11(b).  According to Storage Tank, Local\n\nRule 11 does not apply to  a Renewed Motion for Judgment as a\n\nMatter of Law.  We disagree.\n\n          U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  R., D.N.H.  11(a)(1)  states that\n\n\"[m]otions other than during trial will be considered only if\n                                  \n\nsubmitted separately from other pleadings on a document using\n\nthe word `Motion' in the  title.  The Clerk shall  not accept\n\n                    \n\n21.  District of New Hampshire Local Rule 11(b) states:\n\n     (b)  SEEKING CONCURRENCE IN MOTIONS\n\n          The moving  party shall  certify to  the court\n     that  he has  made a good  faith attempt  to obtain\n     concurrence in  the relief  sought.  If  the moving\n     party has obtained concurrence,  he shall so  state\n     in the body of the motion so the court may consider\n     it without delay.\n\n                             -44-\n\nany  motions not  in compliance  with procedures  outlined in\n\nthese Rules.\"   (emphasis  added).  Assuming,  arguendo, that\n                                                       \n\nthe phrase \"any motions\" in the second sentence of Local Rule\n\n11(a)(1)  means \"any  motions other  than during  trial,\" the\n\nissue  becomes whether  a Renewed  Motion for  Judgment as  a\n\nMatter of Law  is a  trial motion,  which is  not subject  to\n\nLocal Rule 11, or  a \"motion other than during  trial,\" which\n\nis subject to  Local Rule  11.  Like  the district court,  we\n\nconclude  that a Renewed Motion  for Judgment as  a Matter of\n\nLaw,  which may be filed as many  as ten days after the entry\n\nof  judgment, is a \"motion other than during trial\" that must\n\ncomply with the strictures of Local Rule 11(b).  Accordingly,\n\nthe  district court was entitled to enforce its local rule by\n\nrefusing to  file Storage Tank's Renewed  Motion for Judgment\n\nas a Matter of  Law, and we cannot say that,  by doing so, it\n\nengaged  in a clear injustice.  See Atlas Truck Leasing, Inc.\n                                                             \n\nv.

On  appeal, Storage  Tank raises  two\n\nadditional arguments not made in its Motion for Judgment as a\n\nMatter  of  Law.   First,  it contends  that  Clausen's trial\n\n                             -46-\n\ntestimony unequivocally established  that he fell on  staging\n\nplanks  that   had  been  placed  over   the  existing  ramp.\n\nConsequently, Storage Tank maintains that, because it did not\n\neither  own or  control staging planks     or  receive notice\n\nthat staging planks had been placed over the existing ramp   \n\nthere was insufficient evidence  upon which a reasonable jury\n\ncould  have found  Storage Tank  negligent.   Second, Storage\n\nTank asserts that \"Goudreau . . .  assumed responsibility for\n\nthe  safety   of  the  work  area  pursuant  to  the  written\n\ncontract.\"  We decline  to reach the merits of  these freshly\n\nraised arguments, however, because \"[a]ppellate review may be\n\nobtained only on the specific ground stated in the motion for\n\ndirected verdict.\"  Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell\n                                                             \n\nBd.  of  Realtors,  850  F.2d 803,  810  (1st  Cir.)  (citing\n                 \n\nPstragowski v.

Ed. 2d 381 (1988).\n\n          With regard  to whether Clausen  was contributorily\n\nnegligent for failing to  observe an obvious danger,  we find\n\nsufficient evidence  upon which a reasonable  jury could find\n\nthat he was not.  Clausen was injured on his first day on the\n\njob and on his first trip down the ramp.   He, therefore, had\n\nno prior  personal experience with the  slippery condition of\n\nthe ramp.  Moreover, Clausen testified that the one-half-inch\n\nsheet of  ice that caked the  ramp was concealed by  snow and\n\n                             -47-\n\nthat  nobody had  told him  prior to  the accident  about the\n\npresence of ice on the ramp.  Similarly unavailing is Storage\n\nTank's contention that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof  law because  it  did not  receive  notice of  the  ramp's\n\ndangerous  condition  or  an  opportunity  to  take  remedial\n\naction.  Because there  was evidence at trial from  which the\n\njury  could reasonably find that  Storage Tank knew or should\n\nhave known that ice and snow would accumulate on the ramp and\n\nthat Storage  Tank was responsible for taking action to clear\n\nthe ramp, the jury \"could likewise  find that reasonable care\n\nrequired that [Storage Tank]  should have taken such action.\"\n\nTremblay  v.

On  February 6,\n                                          \n\n1989, Eric Clausen (\"Clausen\"),  plaintiff-appellee, slipped,\n\nfell, and injured his back while  working as a pile driver at\n\na  job site  at a  fuel terminal  facility on  the Piscataqua\n\nRiver,  Portsmouth  Harbor,  Newington,  New  Hampshire.    A\n\nMassachusetts  resident, Clausen  sued for  negligence, under\n\nthe  diversity jurisdiction,  in the  United States  District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire.  Defendants were the\n\nowner  of  the  facility,  Storage  Tank   Development  Corp.\n\n(\"Storage  Tank\"),  a  New  Hampshire  corporation,  and  the\n\noccupier  of the  facility,  Sea-3, Inc.  (\"Sea-3\"), a  Texas\n\ncorporation.  Defendants filed third-party complaints against\n\nClausen's employer, Goudreau Construction Corp. (\"Goudreau\").\n\n          Clausen's claims went to trial beginning on October\n\n5,  1992.   Storage  Tank's  and  Sea-3's third-party  claims\n\nagainst  Goudreau were omitted from  that trial.1  On October\n\n9,  1992, the jury  returned a  special verdict  in Clausen's\n\nfavor, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a), finding him to have\n\nbeen  damaged in the amount  of $1,426,000.2   On October 13,\n\n1992, the district court  entered judgment in accordance with\n\nthe  special verdict.   On  December 31,  1992, the  district\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district  court  ordered  a separate  trial  of  the\ndefendants' third-party  claims against Goudreau  pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 42(b).\n\n2.  Responding  to special  questions,  the jury  apportioned\nliability  against Storage Tank at 37.5%, Sea-3 at 37.5%, and\nGoudreau at 25%.\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt clarified its October 13, 1992,  judgment to hold Sea-3\n\nand  Storage Tank jointly and severally liable to Clausen for\n\n$1,426,000,  with prejudgment  interest  at the  rate of  ten\n\npercent (10%)  from the date of the  complaint to the date of\n\nthe  verdict, plus  costs.   On January  22, 1993,  Sea-3 and\n\nStorage  Tank  filed  separate  notices of  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict court's  December 31,  1992, amended judgment.3   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                    APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          Clausen  argues  that  we  do  not  have  appellate\n\njurisdiction over  Storage Tank's appeal because the district\n\ncourt's  December  31,  1992,  amended judgment  was  not  an\n\nappealable \"final decision\" as that term is used in 28 U.S.C.\n\n  1291 (1988).4  We trace the procedural history.\n\n          When  Storage Tank  filed its  notice of  appeal on\n\nJanuary  22, 1993,  from  the district  court's December  31,\n\n                    \n\n3.  On March  1, 1994, Sea-3 and Clausen reached a settlement\nagreement  in  which Sea-3  agreed  to  withdraw its  appeal.\nAccordingly, on March 7, 1994, we entered an order dismissing\nSea-3's appeal pursuant  to Fed.  R. App. P.  42(b).   Hence,\nStorage Tank remains the sole appellant. \n\n4.  28 U.S.C.   1291 (1988) states in pertinent part:\n\n          The courts of  appeals (other than  the United\n     States Court of  Appeals for  the Federal  Circuit)\n     shall have jurisdiction of  appeals from all  final\n                                                        \n     decisions of district courts of the United States .\n                                                      \n     . . .\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -4-\n\n1992,  amended  judgment,  its  own  unresolved,  third-party\n\nclaims were  still pending against Goudreau.   This situation\n\nwas problematic because a judgment\n\n     that  completely  disposes  of  . . . any  separate\n     claim  in  the  suit[,]  without disposing  of  the\n     third-party  claim,  is  not  appealable  unless  a\n     judgment is entered by the district court [pursuant\n     to  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.  54(b)5]   on  the  express\n     determination  that there  is  no just  reason  for\n     delay, and  an express  direction for the  entry of\n     judgment.\n\n6 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice   54.36 (2d\n                                                 \n\ned.  1993).   As the district  court had  not yet  entered an\n\nappealable judgment within Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b),  this court\n\nadvised Storage Tank, by order entered February 9, 1993, that\n\n\"[u]pon  review of the record  in this case,  it appears that\n\nthis court may not  have jurisdiction to consider the  appeal\n\nbecause  a third  party complaint . . . may  be outstanding.\"\n\nWe  directed  Storage  Tank  \"either to  move  for  voluntary\n\ndismissal under  Fed. R. App. P.  42(b) or to show  cause why\n\n[its] appeal should not be dismissed.\"  \n\n                    \n\n5.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) states in pertinent part:\n\n          When  more  than  one  claim  for  relief   is\n     presented  in  an  action,   whether  as  a  claim,\n     counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or\n     when multiple parties  are involved, the court  may\n     direct the entry of  a final judgment as to  one or\n     more but fewer  than all of  the claims or  parties\n     only upon an express determination that there is no\n     just reason for delay and upon an express direction\n     for the entry of judgment.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Following our February  9, 1993, show cause  order,\n\nClausen on February  19 moved the district court  to \"certify\n\n[pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)] that the judgment entered\n\non October 13 and amended on December 31, 1992[,] is a `final\n\njudgment'  and `that  there is  no just  reason for  delay.'\"\n\nStorage Tank  then moved this  court for  additional time  to\n\nrespond to our February 9, 1993, show cause order.  On  March\n\n4, 1993,  we granted  appellant's motion, extending  the time\n\nwithin which  Storage Tank could  respond to our  February 9,\n\n1993,  order until  March 23,  1993.  In  our March  4, 1993,\n\norder  we instructed  Storage Tank  that, \"[i]f  the district\n\ncourt  certifies its  [judgment]  as final  pursuant to  Rule\n\n54(b),  then,  in  order  to  avoid  any  . . . doubts  [over\n\njurisdiction], appellant[]  should file  [a] new  notice[] of\n\nappeal.\" \n\n          On March 31, 1993,  over objection by the appellant\n\nand after oral argument, the district court  entered an order\n\nin which it  found, pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b), \"that\n\nthe judgment entered on  December 31, 1992, in favor  of Eric\n\nClausen and  against Storage  Tank . . . is a  final judgment\n\nand  that there  is  no just  reason  for delaying  appellate\n\nreview.\"    Notwithstanding our  earlier  direction  that, to\n\navoid jurisdictional complications, Storage Tank submit a new\n\nnotice of appeal following the district court's Fed.  R. Civ.\n\n                             -6-\n\nP.  54(b)  certification,  Storage  Tank did  not  take  such\n\naction. \n\n          Clausen now contends that as Storage Tank's  notice\n\nof appeal    filed on January 22, 1993, more than  two months\n\nprior to the  district court's entry of  judgment pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)    was  premature, it should be treated\n\nas  a nullity.6  Clausen  is undoubtedly correct that Storage\n\nTank's  notice of  appeal  filed after  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n6.

There, the Supreme Court decided that,  \"under [Fed.\n\nR.

Although Clausen argues  to the contrary,\n\nwe  believe  that the  district  court's  December 31,  1992,\n\namended judgment  was sufficiently a \"decision\"  for purposes\n\nof Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2). \n\n          In  FirsTier,  the petitioner  filed its  notice of\n                      \n\nappeal on  February 8,  1989, after  the  district court  had\n\nannounced  from  the  bench, on  January  26,  1989, that  it\n\nintended  to grant summary  judgment for the  respondent.  On\n\nMarch  3, 1989,  the district  court entered  judgment.   The\n\nquestion  addressed by  the  Court was  whether the  district\n\ncourt's bench ruling  was a \"decision\" under  Rule 4(a)(2) so\n\nthat the petitioner's premature notice of appeal would relate\n\nforward  to  the date  of  the  judgment, thereby  conferring\n\njurisdiction  upon the court of appeals.  In finding that the\n\nbench ruling  was a \"decision\"  under Rule 4(a)(2),  and that\n\nthe  court  of  appeals  had jurisdiction  to  entertain  the\n\nappeal, the Court held that \"Rule 4(a)(2) permits a notice of\n\nappeal from a  nonfinal decision  to operate as  a notice  of\n\nappeal  from the  final judgment only  when a  district court\n\nannounces a decision that  would be appealable if immediately\n                                   \n\nfollowed by  the entry of judgment.\"  Id. at 276 (emphasis in\n                                         \n\noriginal).  The Court  qualified this principle by explaining\n\n                             -11-\n\nthat Rule 4(a)(2) does not permit a \"notice of  appeal from a\n\nclearly interlocutory decision     such as a discovery ruling\n\nor a  sanction order under  Rule 11  of the Federal  Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure     to serve as  a notice of appeal  from the\n\nfinal judgment.\"  Id.\n                     \n\n          In  this case,  the district  court's December  31,\n\n1992,  amended judgment  was  not literally  a decision  that\n\nwould be appealable if immediately  followed by the entry  of\n\njudgment.   This is because,  with third-party claims  as yet\n\nunresolved, the  December 31, 1992, amended  judgment did not\n\ndispose of all the  claims in the case.   Therefore, judgment\n\ncould  not perfunctorily  be  entered  following  the  ruling\n          \n\nabsent the certification called for by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\nTo  certify,  the  district  court had  to  make  an  express\n\ndetermination  of no just reason for delay.  Only having done\n\nso was it  free to enter a  final judgment upon  its December\n\n31,  1992, amended judgment.   Thus,  the December  31, 1992,\n\namended judgment here does  not, at first blush, seem  to fit\n\nwithin  the  Court's language  in  FirsTier  and its  progeny\n                                           \n\nindicating  that a  decision  that would  be appealable  when\n\nimmediately followed  by the  entry of  judgment is  one that\n\n\"form[s]  the basis  of a  final judgment  without subsequent\n\nintervention by the district court.\"  Serine v.

R.\n\nApp.  P.  4(a)(2) cannot  cure.   The  examples given  were a\n\ndiscovery ruling or  a sanction  order under Rule  11 of  the\n\nFederal  Rules of Civil Procedure.  There is no commonly used\n\nprocedure  for transforming  such interlocutory  rulings into\n\nappealable, final  dispositions, as Rule 54(b)  allows in the\n\ninstance of decisions that  dispose of some, but not  all, of\n\nthe claims in  a case.   Thus, the  district court's  amended\n\njudgment  in this  case falls  somewhere along  the continuum\n\nbetween an unalterably interlocutory decision, the notice  of\n\nappeal from which can never serve as a notice of appeal  from\n\nthe final judgment, FirsTier, 498 U.S.  at 276, and decisions\n                            \n\nthat would be appealable  under Rule 4(a)(2) when immediately\n\nfollowed  by  the entry  of  judgment.   We  ask,  therefore,\n\nwhether the district court's amended judgment is close enough\n\nto  a  \"decision  that  would be  appealable  if  immediately\n                                \n\nfollowed by the entry  of judgment,\" id., to be  a \"decision\"\n                                        \n\n                             -13-\n\nfor  purposes of  Fed.  R. App.  P. 4(a)(2).   Our  answer is\n\n\"Yes.\"9\n\n          The  district court's  December  31, 1992,  amended\n\njudgment bears  far more similarity to a  decision that would\n\nbe  appealable  if  immediately  followed  by  the  entry  of\n\njudgment than  to the purely interlocutory  decrees described\n\nin FirsTier.   Unlike these, the  December 31, 1992,  amended\n           \n\njudgment was a decision that purported to  dispose finally of\n\nall  of Clausen's claims against Storage Tank, if not all the\n\nclaims in the  lawsuit.   The decision  lacked finality  only\n\nbecause the district court had to find that there was no just\n\nreason  for delay  and certify  it as  appealable immediately\n\npursuant  to Fed. R. Civ.  P. 54(b).   Although this required\n\nthe district  court to make an  additional finding concerning\n\nthe appropriateness of an  immediate appeal, that finding did\n\nnot affect the substance or the scope of the amended judgment\n\nfrom which  the  premature appeal  was taken.   Rather,  once\n\nmade,  the district  court's  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 54(b)  ruling\n\ninstantly converted the substance of the former interlocutory\n\namended  judgment  into  a   wholly  appealable  one  without\n                                                             \n\nmodifying or enlarging that decision in any way.  \n                                               \n\n                    \n\n9.  FirsTier,  of  course, did  not involve  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n            \n54(b); hence, the Court should not necessarily be expected to\nhave anticipated the niceties of the present situation, which\nis sui generis.  \n              \n\n                             -14-\n\n          The  primary  difference between  the  December 31,\n\n1992,  decision in this case and the bench ruling in FirsTier\n                                                             \n\nwas  that the  district  court here  could not  perfunctorily\n\nenter  judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.  58.  Rather, it had to\n\nsatisfy itself and certify that  the decision was, in effect,\n\nappropriate for immediate appeal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n54(b), notwithstanding its failure to resolve all claims made\n\nin  the lawsuit.10   This difference, however,  does not make\n\nthe district  court's December 31, 1992,  amended judgment so\n\ndissimilar from the district court's bench ruling in FirsTier\n                                                             \n\nthat Storage Tank  should lose the protection of  the savings\n\nclause of  Fed. R. App.  P. 4(a)(2).  In  both instances, the\n\nprematurely-appealed decisions  remained absolutely unaltered\n\nto and through entry of an appealable judgment.    \n\n          Consequently, we  hold that,  by virtue of  Fed. R.\n\nApp. P.  4(a)(2), Storage  Tank's premature notice  of appeal\n\nripened when  the district  court certified its  December 31,\n\n1992, amended judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  As\n\nwe  have appellate jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of the\n\nappeal.\n\n                             II.\n\n                    \n\n10.  It could be said  that, for the purposes of Fed. R. App.\nP. 4(a)(2), a Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification  plays the\nsame role as entry of judgment under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 58.  In\nother  words, \"entry of judgment,\" as  that phrase appears in\nFed.  R. App. P. 4(a)(2),  encompasses Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b)\ncertifications.\n\n                             -15-\n\n                         BACKGROUND \n\n          Storage  Tank  owns  docking  facilities  along the\n\nPiscataqua River in Newington,  New Hampshire.  These include\n\na  walkway-pier that  first extends perpendicularly  from the\n\nshore line into the  water, and then turns ninety  degrees to\n\nthe  left and  extends  upstream.   A concrete  mooring cell,\n\nreferred to as Cell Three, is located in the water beyond the\n\nend  of the  walkway-pier.11   Cell  Three,  at the  time  of\n\nClausen's injury,  was connected to  the end of  the walkway-\n\npier  by the ramp upon  which Clausen slipped  and fell.  The\n\nramp sloped downward to Cell Three from the walkway-pier.  In\n\nApril 1992, the ramp was replaced by Storage Tank, at Sea-3's\n\nrequest,  with a set of  steps because the  concrete cell cap\n\nhad settled.\n\n          Sea-3  imports  and distributes  petroleum products\n\nthroughout New England.   At all material times, Sea-3  had a\n\nfirst-priority  contractual  right,  under  a  so-called Dock\n\nAgreement with  Storage Tank, to  occupy and use  the docking\n\nfacilities.  In  1983, Sea-3  sought to  improve the  docking\n\nfacilities by making structural changes to Cell Three.  Sea-3\n\ncontracted with Goudreau  to perform the work.   Storage Tank\n\nwas not a party to that contract.\n\n                    \n\n11.  The  mooring cells  were filled  with gravel  and capped\nwith  concrete  to  provide  support  for  the  dolphins  and\nbollards upon which vessels attached their mooring lines.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          On February 5, 1989, Goudreau hired Clausen to work\n\non Cell Three as a  pile driver.  Clausen's first day  on the\n\njob was February  6, 1989,  the day he  suffered his  injury.\n\nWhen  Clausen arrived  at the job  site at  7:00 a.m.  on the\n\nmorning of February 6, 1989, it was snowing.  Between one and\n\ntwo inches of fresh  snow had accumulated on the dock.   Upon\n\nreceiving  permission   to  begin   work,  Clausen   and  his\n\ncoworkers,  Daniel  Woundy,  William  Burroughs,  and Kenneth\n\nKing,  the foreman, proceeded  down the  walkway-pier towards\n\nCell Three.  Prior to the group's arrival at Cell Three, King\n\ninstructed  Clausen to go back and retrieve an air compressor\n\nhose  that was stored in a guardhouse.  Clausen retrieved the\n\nair compressor hose  and then headed  back down the  walkway-\n\npier toward the ramp that  connected the walkway-pier to Cell\n\nThree.  Somewhere along the ramp that connected  the walkway-\n\npier to Cell  Three, Clausen slipped,  fell, and injured  his\n\nback.   \n\n          Immediately  after  the  fall, Clausen  experienced\n\npain  that radiated down his back to  his ankle.  Despite the\n\npain, Clausen continued to work until his lunch break.  After\n\nlunch,  Clausen was in too much pain to continue working, and\n\nhe decided  to go home for  the day.  Upon  arriving at home,\n\nClausen  immediately made an  appointment with a chiropractor\n\nfor 3:00 p.m. that afternoon.\n\n                             -17-\n\n          For   approximately   eight  weeks   following  the\n\naccident, Clausen  was treated  by his chiropractor.   A  CAT\n\nscan taken two months after the accident revealed a herniated\n\ndisk at the L5-S1 level.  Consequently, Clausen was  referred\n\nto  Dr. Gerwin  Neumann, a  neurosurgeon at  the New  England\n\nBaptist  Hospital.  After confirming the  diagnosis of a disk\n\nherniation in L5-S1,  Dr. Neumann, in May 1989, performed the\n\nfirst of  what would eventually be  five operations performed\n\non various disks in Clausen's back.\n\n          At  trial,   Clausen,  the  only   witness  to  the\n\naccident,  testified  that the  ramp  on  which  he fell  was\n\nconstructed of  what looked  like two-inch thick  by ten-inch\n\nwide \"staging  planks\" that were joined together  by a couple\n\nof slats.  Clausen further testified that the ramp was ten to\n\ntwelve  feet  long and  was covered  by  snow.   According to\n\nClausen,  the ramp protruded up  over the walkway-pier by ten\n\nto twelve inches so  that he had to step up onto  the ramp in\n\norder  to proceed  down to  Cell Three.   Clausen's testimony\n\nrevealed  that he initially stepped up onto the ramp with his\n\nleft foot.  He did  not have his hand on the  railing because\n\nit did  not come up high enough for him to reach it.  Clausen\n\nthen lifted  his right foot  off the  ground, and, as  he was\n\nabout to place it on  the ramp, his left foot slipped  and he\n\nstarted  to fall.   Clausen  testified that,  as he  fell, he\n\ntwisted to the right and twisted back to the left and grabbed\n\n                             -18-\n\nonto  the railing with his right  hand as he was coming down.\n\nThen  he hit  the ramp.   At that point,  Clausen was holding\n\nonto  the railing and had one hand  on the ramp.  He then let\n\nhimself go and slid down the ramp the rest of the way to Cell\n\nThree.  According  to Clausen's trial testimony,  once he got\n\nto the bottom, he looked back up and saw a sheet of ice about\n\none-half inch thick covering the ramp from top to bottom.12\n\n          Based on Clausen's testimony, the defendants argued\n\nat trial  that Clausen had actually slipped on staging planks\n\nthat had been placed by Goudreau  employees over the existing\n\nramp that  connected  the walkway-pier  to  Cell Three.    No\n\nwitness testified  at trial, however, to  having seen staging\n\nplanks  placed over  the ramp.   To  the contrary,  there was\n\n                    \n\n12.  Clausen's  trial  testimony  did  not  comport  with his\nearlier answers  to interrogatories  with regard to  where he\nslipped and fell on the ramp.  In response to interrogatories\nthat  inquired about  how and  where  his fall  had occurred,\nClausen did not state that he slipped as he stepped onto  the\nramp, but  rather answered  that \"[t]he incident  occurred at\nthe junction of the concrete cell and  a gangplank connecting\nthe cell to the pier\" and that \"[a]s [he] was moving from the\ngangplank to the cell,  [he] was suddenly caused to  slip and\nfall.\"  \n\n     Clausen's trial testimony  was consistent, however, with\nprevious deposition testimony in which he stated:\n\n     So as I stepped up with  my left foot and I went to\n     reach  for [the rail],  I brought my  right foot up\n     and  that's when I slipped and fell.  And I twisted\n     my  back and as I  came back around,  that's when I\n     grabbed ahold of  the railing and I  just fell down\n     on my backside.\n\n                             -19-\n\ntestimony that the ramp  was \"fixed\" between the walkway-pier\n\nand  Cell Three  and that  it did  not  protrude up  over the\n\nwalkway-pier, but was \"flush\" with it so that one had to step\n\ndown onto the  ramp when walking  to Cell Three.   There  was\n\nfurther testimony  that the  ramp had  cleats or  treads, ten\n\ninches  to one foot apart,  running crosswise all  the way up\n\nthe length of the ramp.  The ramp itself, according to  trial\n\nwitnesses,  was approximately  five  feet wide  by five  feet\n\nlong.\n\n          Clausen also  testified at trial that  he still had\n\nback  pain  that radiated  down his  left  leg.   Dr. Neumann\n\ntestified that there was a direct causal relationship between\n\nthe accident on the ramp and Clausen's herniated disks, which\n\nrequired  five operations  to repair.   He  further testified\n\nthat Clausen can lift  no more than fifteen to  twenty pounds\n\nand  is totally  disabled from  a strenuous  job.   He noted,\n\nhowever,  that,  if  Clausen's  medical  condition  were   to\n\nstabilize, he could engage in sedentary or clerical activity.\n\n          To  establish  damages  at  trial,  Clausen  called\n\nRobert  Doucette,  an  expert  economist,  to  testify  about\n\nClausen's loss  of earning  capacity.   Doucette said  he had\n\nexamined Clausen's tax  returns, copies  of union  contracts,\n\nmedical  records, and  statistical information  pertaining to\n\nwork-life expectancy.   He  testified that he  used Clausen's\n\nunion  contract to calculate Clausen's  base wage rate at the\n\n                             -20-\n\ntime  of his injury.   In reliance on  the contract, Doucette\n\nconcluded that  Clausen was  earning a gross  hourly wage  of\n\n$18.45 when  the accident  occurred.   He then  adjusted this\n\nfigure  upward to  $23.85 per hour  to account  for Clausen's\n\nfringe benefits  under the union contract,  which included an\n\nannuity fund,  a pension fund,  and health  insurance.   From\n\nthese  preliminary figures,  Doucette concluded  that it  was\n\nreasonable  to  anticipate  that  Clausen would  have  earned\n\napproximately  $875,000  in  gross  wages  and   $391,000  in\n\nbenefits from the  time he was  injured, at age  thirty-four,\n\nthrough the age of his work-life expectancy.13\n\n          Doucette   adjusted   these   gross    figures   by\n\nsubtracting  income  taxes,  adding   the  average  value  of\n\nhousehold  services at minimum wage, and adding a lump sum to\n\nmeet income tax liability on interest earnings.  After making\n\nthese adjustments, Doucette concluded that the  present value\n\nof Clausen's  earning  capacity on  the  date of  his  injury\n\ntotaled approximately $1,250,000.  He explained that this sum\n\nrepresents the  amount of  economic value that  Clausen could\n\nhave been expected to produce if he had not been injured, and\n\nany pecuniary damages attributable  to the injury is measured\n\n                    \n\n13.  According to Doucette, work-life expectancy expresses an\naverage of  how long a  person may be  expected to be  in the\nlabor force earning income.   It is a function  of a person's\nage, sex, level of education, and activity level.\n\n                             -21-\n\nby  the difference  between  $1,250,000 and  what Clausen  is\n\nstill able to earn in the future. \n\n                             III.\n\n          Storage  Tank contends that the district court made\n\nerrors  both during trial and after trial.  Among the former,\n\nStorage Tank  alleges mistaken  evidentiary rulings  and jury\n\ninstructions.  It argues that the district court erred in (1)\n\nallowing evidence of subsequent remedial  measures undertaken\n\non  the ramp  where  Clausen slipped  and  fell, (2)  denying\n\nStorage  Tank's  counsel  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine\n\nClausen's  economist,  Doucette,  on  the  subject  of  union\n\nbenefits that  Clausen allegedly received after the accident,\n\nand  (3)  instructing  the   jury  to  assess  fault  against\n\nGoudreau, a non-party to the trial.  In the category of post-\n\ntrial error, Storage Tank objects to the district court's (1)\n\nrefusal to file its  Renewed Motion for Judgment as  a Matter\n\nof Law,  (2) denial of its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of\n\nLaw,  and (3)  denial of  its  Motion to  Alter or  Amend the\n\nJudgment.\n\n          We find merit in none of these arguments.\n\nA.   Alleged Trial Errors\n\n     1.   Evidence of Subsequent Remedial Measures\n                                                  \n\n          Storage Tank complains of the allowance of evidence\n\nthat,  in 1992, Storage Tank, at  Sea-3's request, replaced a\n\nramp on which  Clausen fell with  a set of  steps.  Prior  to\n\n                             -22-\n\ntrial, Storage Tank had  filed a motion in limine  seeking to\n\nexclude evidence  of the changes made to the ramp both on the\n\nissues of negligence and control.  Storage Tank argued in its\n\nmotion that  evidence  of  subsequent  remedial  measures  is\n\ninadmissible  under Fed.  R. Evid.  40714 to  prove negligent\n\nor culpable conduct.  It also contended that,  although there\n\nwas  an unresolved issue in  the case about whether Goudreau,\n\nStorage  Tank,  Sea-3,  or  some  combination  of  the  three\n\ncontrolled the area where  Clausen fell, the evidence of  the\n\nramp's replacement  in this case carried  no probative weight\n\nwith  regard to the control issue.  The district court denied\n\nStorage Tank's motion in limine, but limited the scope of the\n\nevidence to  the issue of who had control over the area where\n\nClausen's  injury occurred.   At  the end  of the  trial, the\n\ndistrict  court gave the jury a  limiting instruction to this\n\neffect.\n\n                    \n\n14.  Fed. R. Evid. 407 states:\n\n          When,  after  an  event,  measures  are  taken\n     which, if  taken  previously, would  have made  the\n     event  less  likely  to   occur,  evidence  of  the\n     subsequent  measures  is  not admissible  to  prove\n     negligence  or culpable conduct  in connection with\n     the  event.    This   rule  does  not  require  the\n                                                        \n     exclusion of  evidence of subsequent  measures when\n                                                        \n     offered  for  another  purpose,  such   as  proving\n                                                        \n     ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary\n                                                        \n     measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\n                                               \n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -23-\n\n          On appeal, Storage  Tank insists that the  district\n\ncourt  should not have allowed Clausen to introduce  evidence\n\nof the replacement of the ramp under the control exception to\n\nFed. R.  Evid. 407.  It contends  that the probative value of\n\nthe evidence  was \"substantially outweighed by  the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of  the issues, or misleading the\n\njury.\"    Fed. R.  Evid.  403.15   Clausen  asserts, however,\n\nthat  we need not reach the merits of Storage Tank's argument\n\nbecause  it did not preserve  the issue for  appeal by timely\n\nobjecting  at trial to the  admission of the  evidence of the\n\nramp's replacement.  We agree.\n\n          During  the  charging  conference,   the  following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n     Mr. Clinton:   First  of  all,   your  Honor,   the\n     remedial  instruction with  regard to the  issue of\n     control  of the  stairs  in 1992  was only  for the\n     purpose of control.\n\n     The Court:     In other words, you admitted it only\n     for the  purpose of control and  not for liability?\n     When it came in, there was no objection.  I was    \n\n     Mr. Clinton:   Well, I objected.\n\n                    \n\n15.  Fed. R. Evid. 403, in full, states:\n\n          Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if\n     its probative value is substantially  outweighed by\n     the  danger of unfair  prejudice, confusion  of the\n     issues,   or    misleading   the   jury,    or   by\n     considerations of  undue delay, waste  of time,  or\n     needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -24-\n\n     The Court:     When?  Not when it  was offered, not\n     when it came in.  I'll be glad to put in  something\n     like that, but I was sitting here waiting    \n\n     Mr. Clinton:   I filed  a motion in  limine instead\n     of repeating.  You denied the motion  in limine, so\n     I figured you ruled.\n\n     The Court:     But when no objection came, I didn't\n     know  at that  point whether  you had  changed your\n     position or what. . . .\n\nFrom this colloquy,  it appears that  Storage Tank felt  that\n\nthe district court's earlier denial  of its motion in  limine\n\nhad relieved it of any need to object to the admission of the\n\nevidence  of the subsequent repair at the time it was offered\n\nat trial. \n\n          In United  States v.  Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592213\"><a href=\"/opinion/592213/united-states-v-daniel-l-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992), we said that \"[a] motion in limine without subsequent,\n                                         \n\ncontemporaneous  objection  at trial,  .  .  . is  ordinarily\n\ninsufficient to preserve  an evidentiary ruling for  appeal.\"\n\nId. at 17 (citing Fed.

More recently,  we\n   \n\nexpanded upon this general proposition by holding:\n\n          Where  an  objection   to  evidence  has  been\n     overruled in limine, it makes sense to require that\n     the  objection   be  renewed  at  trial.    However\n     definite the denial of  the motion to exclude prior\n     to  trial, it is  child's play for  the opponent of\n     the  evidence  to  renew  the  objection  when  the\n     evidence  is actually  offered; and  requiring this\n     renewal   gives  the   trial  judge  a   chance  to\n     reconsider  the ruling  with the  concrete evidence\n     presented in the actual context of the trial.\n\nFusco v.

It  is utterly  clear  that the  district court's\n\ndecision  to permit the evidence  of the changes  made to the\n\nramp in 1992, whether right or wrong, was not plain error.\n\n          Although Fed. R. Evid. 407 proscribes the admission\n\nof   evidence  of  subsequent  remedial  measures  to  \"prove\n\n                             -27-\n\nnegligence or culpable conduct,\"  it allows such evidence, as\n\nalready  noted, \"when  offered for  another purpose,  such as\n\nproving .  . .  control.\"   Fed. R. Evid.  407.   The parties\n\nagree that control  of the ramp  area where Clausen's  injury\n\noccurred was a material issue in this case.  According to the\n\nappellant, one aspect of the control issue arose because both\n\nStorage Tank and  Sea-3 asserted that Goudreau was in control\n\nof the work site and was, therefore, responsible for clearing\n\nand  sanding the  area  where the  plaintiff  fell.   Clausen\n\npoints  out that a second aspect of the control issue in this\n\ncase,  not  alluded  to  by Storage  Tank,  involved  whether\n\nStorage  Tank, Sea-3,  or both  jointly, controlled  the area\n\nwhere Clausen fell if Goudreau, at that time, did not control\n\nthe ramp.16\n\n          To be  sure, Storage Tank argues  that the evidence\n\nthat  it made  changes to  the ramp  at the request  of Sea-3\n\nsubsequent to  Clausen's accident was  inadmissible under the\n\n                    \n\n16.  The  trial judge's  summary of  the control  issue sheds\nadditional light on the parties' arguments:\n\n     As  I understand  it,  and as  I'm putting  it, the\n     defendants,  one, deny that  there was an accident,\n     two, they say  if there was  an accident, each  one\n     denies that  it was responsible  and maintains that\n     any  fault  was that  either  of  the plaintiff  or\n     Goudreau or both, and to each one there's an  issue\n     as to who was  in control of the premises.   You're\n                                                        \n     not  in agreement  on that,  although you  both say\n                                                        \n     that Goudreau  was in control of  the premises, but\n                                                        \n     if not, then who was?\n                          \n\n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -28-\n\ncontrol exception to Fed.  R. Evid. 407 because  the evidence\n\nfailed  to satisfy  the independent  requirements of  Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403.  Storage Tank maintains that, because the ramp was\n\nreplaced in 1992,  approximately three years  after Clausen's\n\nfall, the evidence  is not probative of  whether Storage Tank\n\nor Sea-3  controlled the ramp, either  separately or jointly,\n\nin 1989,  particularly since, according to  Storage Tank, the\n\narea had been exclusively occupied by Goudreau when Clausen's\n\ninjury occurred.  Whatever can be said for such arguments had\n\nStorage Tank preserved its right to argue the merits, they do\n\nnot come close to  demonstrating that it was plain  error for\n\nthe district  court to believe  that the evidence  carried at\n\nleast  some probative weight as to who controlled the ramp in\n\n1989.\n\n          Storage  Tank  also suggests  that  it  was greatly\n\nprejudiced because the jury may have used the evidence of the\n\nramp's  replacement  for an  improper  purpose.   The  judge,\n\nhowever,  instructed  the   jury  that  \"[e]vidence   of  the\n\nsubsequent  installation   of  stairs  in  1992  is  evidence\n\nrelevant  only on  the issue  of control.   It  is not  to be\n\nconsidered evidence of liability or fault.\"  According to the\n\nadvisory  committee's  notes  to  Fed. R.  Evid.  403,  \"[i]n\n\nreaching a decision  whether to exclude on  grounds of unfair\n\nprejudice,  consideration should  be  given to  the  probable\n\neffectiveness  or  lack   of  effectiveness  of   a  limiting\n\n                             -29-\n\ninstruction.\"  Although limiting instructions  may not always\n\nbe effective,  see, e.g.,  United States v.

Cross-Examination of Clausen's Expert, Doucette\n                                                         \n\n          At  trial,  Clausen  testified  that,  as  a  union\n\nmember,  he  had   enjoyed  certain  union  employee   fringe\n\nbenefits, including a  pension plan, an  annuity fund, and  a\n\n\"health and welfare dental plan.\"   Clausen did not  mention,\n\nin  this   regard,  workers'  compensation   payments,  union\n\ndisability  benefits, or social security disability benefits.\n\nLater  in the  trial, Clausen's  expert, Doucette,  estimated\n\nClausen's  pecuniary damages  (i.e.,  lost future  earnings),\n                                   \n\nincluding  wages  and fringe  benefits  lost  because of  his\n\ninability to  perform his former  job due to the  injury.  In\n\ndetermining this figure, Doucette testified that Clausen,  at\n\nthe time  of his injury, had  earned \"a gross hourly  wage of\n\n                             -30-\n\n$18.45  per hour.\"  He  also testified that  Clausen had then\n\nenjoyed  fringe benefits    consisting of \"an annuity fund, a\n\npension  fund,  and  health  and  welfare,  which  is  health\n\ninsurance\"     the  gross future  value of  which, calculated\n\nfrom  the time of Clausen's  injury through his  age of work-\n\nlife expectancy, totaled $391,000.   Doucette did not mention\n\nworkers' compensation payments, union disability benefits, or\n\nsocial security disability benefits.\n\n          Prior  to  cross-examining  Doucette,  counsel  for\n\nStorage Tank requested \n\n     a  ruling that [he] be allowed on cross-examination\n     to go into the  union benefits, such as [Clausen's]\n                                                        \n     disability benefits that  he's currently  receiving\n                                                        \n     and  any Social Security  benefits, since they have\n                                                        \n     opened it up by bringing it in as being factors.\n                                                    \n\n(emphasis added).  Counsel  for Clausen strenuously objected,\n\nsaying  the   mentioned  evidence   had  gone  \"only   as  to\n\n[Clausen's] earnings,\" there being \"nothing said with respect\n\nto [Clausen]  being economically  deprived now because  of no\n\nmoney  or  anything  like that.\"    After  hearing  from both\n\nparties,  the  court  denied  Storage  Tank's  request.    In\n\nresponse, Storage Tank's counsel made an offer of proof: \n\n     Note  my exception,  your Honor,  but on  the basis\n     this is the collateral  [source rule].  He's raised\n     the  issue.   This is  an offer.   He's  raised the\n     [issue] of  fringe benefits  under unions and  he's\n     currently receiving disability benefits.\n\n          The  district court  denied Storage  Tank's request\n\nundoubtedly  because of  New  Hampshire's  collateral  source\n\n                             -31-\n\nrule,17   which   provides  that   \"a   plaintiff   [who]  is\n\ncompensated  in  whole or  in part  for  his damages  by some\n\nsource  independent  of  the  tort-feasor  .  .  .  is  still\n\npermitted  to make  full recovery against  him.\"   Moulton v.\n                                                          \n\nGroveton Papers Co.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2059465\"><a href=\"/opinion/2059465/moulton-v-groveton-papers-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span>  <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  909\n                   \n\n(1974).

Courts have\n\nheld,  for  instance,  that,   under  the  Federal  Rules  of\n\nEvidence, \"evidence  of collateral benefits  [ordinarily] has\n\n                    \n\n18.  Courts have expressed various  policy rationales for the\ncollateral  source   rule.     \"Most  fall  into   two  broad\ncategories.   The rule is  intended either (1)  to punish the\ntortfeasor, or (2)  to ensure that the injured party receives\nbenefits for which he or she has contracted.\"   Jacobsen, The\n                                                             \nCollateral Source Rule and  the Role of the Jury,  supra note\n                                                        \n17,  at  528.    The  Supreme  Court  of  New  Hampshire  has\nsummarized these rationales as follows:\n\n     The   basic  argument  advanced  for  [the  rule's]\n     application is  that a  tort-feasor  should not  be\n     allowed to escape the consequences  of his wrongful\n     act  merely  because  his  victim  has  received  a\n     benefit  from  a   collateral  source  which  would\n     constitute  a windfall to  the defendant wrongdoer.\n     It is  also pointed out that in  many instances the\n     plaintiff has  paid for these benefits  in the form\n     of insurance premiums  or concessions in  the wages\n     he received  because of  such fringe benefits.   If\n     such  considerations   are  not  present   and  the\n     payments are gratuitous, it is maintained  that the\n     maker of  these payments did not  intend to relieve\n     the tort-feasor of any liability, but rather to aid\n     the plaintiff  by doing him a  favor. . . .   It is\n     also  argued  that the  collateral  source rule  is\n     designed  to  offset   the  inability  of  ordinary\n     damages   to   adequately  compensate   an  injured\n     accident victim.\n\nMoulton v.

We do not\n\nagree.   Storage Tank's  counsel sought permission  to cross-\n\nexamine Doucette as to \"disability benefits that [Clausen] is\n\ncurrently receiving and any Social Security benefits.\"  These\n\nwere not the benefits Clausen and Doucette had testified were\n\nlost  by reason  of  Clausen's injury     Doucette  mentioned\n\nClausen's loss  of  \"an annuity  fund,  a pension  fund,  and\n\nhealth and welfare, which is health insurance.\"  The district\n\ncourt  had  good  reason  to  think  that  Storage  Tank  was\n\nproposing to  delve into  different contemporary  benefits in\n                                   \n\norder to persuade the jury to reduce its damages award by the\n\namount  of  collateral  payments  that were  currently  being\n\nreceived  from  other  sources  by  the  disabled  plaintiff.\n\nPreventing such  inquiry was consistent  with New Hampshire's\n\ncollateral source  rule.    If Storage  Tank  had  wished  to\n\n                             -35-\n\nexamine  Doucette  on  the  accuracy of  his  projections  of\n\nClausen's economic loss relative to the annuity fund, pension\n\nfund, and health insurance,  it needed to say so,  see infra,\n                                                            \n\nrather than  merely saying  it wanted to  cross-examine about\n\ndisability  and social  security benefits  now being  paid to\n\nClausen.  \n\n          Storage  Tank's reliance  on Haskins  is misplaced.\n                                              \n\nIn  Haskins,  the  plaintiff,  on   direct  examination,  had\n           \n\ntestified  that  certain medical  bills  had  been paid  from\n\ncollateral  sources, namely,  Blue  Cross, Blue  Shield,  and\n\nMedicaid.     The  district  court  allowed  the  defendant's\n\nattorney to \"elicit[] further information concerning the type\n\nand scope  of the collateral source payments.\"   Haskins, 612\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 375.   Here, by contrast, Clausen and  Doucette never\n\ntestified  that  Clausen   was  receiving  collateral  source\n\npayments  (e.g.,  workers'  compensation,   union  disability\n               \n\nbenefits, or  social security disability  benefits).  Rather,\n\nthey  testified  that Clausen  had  permanently lost  certain\n\nemployee  benefits  by  reason  of his  accident  (i.e.,  \"an\n                                                       \n\nannuity  fund, a pension fund, and health and welfare\").  The\n\ndistrict  court  could  reasonably  believe  that  Doucette's\n\ntestimony   concerning  the  purported  value  of  particular\n\nbenefits  that  Clausen had  allegedly  lost  because of  his\n\ninjury  did   not  \"open  the   door\"  to   cross-examination\n\n                             -36-\n\nconcerning  the  receipt by  Clausen of  what appeared  to be\n\ndifferent benefits.19   \n\n          We recognize  that there  is some force  to Storage\n\nTank's  argument, relying on Lange, that, notwithstanding the\n                                  \n\ncollateral  source  rule,  it was  entitled  to cross-examine\n\nDoucette regarding  Clausen's receipt of  disability benefits\n\nto show that  Clausen had not actually lost employee benefits\n\nas indicated by Doucette on direct examination.  In this same\n\nvein,  Storage  Tank asserts  that,  had  the district  court\n\npermitted it to demonstrate on cross-examination that Clausen\n\nhad not  lost his  employee benefits, it  would have  thereby\n\nimpeached  Doucette's credibility.    We need  not reach  the\n\nmerits  of these  arguments,  however,  because Storage  Tank\n\nraises them for the first time on appeal. \n\n          We have held that \"[a] party may not claim error on\n\nappeal in the exclusion of evidence unless the district court\n\nwas told not only  what the party intended to prove  but also\n\nfor what purpose.\"   Tate v.

[a]nd I don't want this  jury's\n\nfinding to be on  that process [sic], and, hence, I object to\n\nits presence  here.\"  Counsel for Storage Tank neither joined\n\nin   Sea-3's  objection  nor  expressed  any  dissatisfaction\n\nwhatsoever  with the  inclusion  of Goudreau  in the  special\n\nverdict questions.\n\n          Counsel  for Sea-3  again raised  his objection  to\n\nGoudreau's inclusion  in the  special verdict  questions just\n\nprior  to  the  district court's  charge  to  the  jury.   He\n\nmaintained  that his  only problem  with the  special verdict\n\nquestions  was  \"the inclusion  of  Goudreau.\"   Counsel  for\n\nStorage  Tank,  on the  other hand,  stated  that he  had \"no\n\nproblem\" with the special  verdict questions and that  he had\n\n\"no objection\" to the  instructions.  Notwithstanding Sea-3's\n\nobjection, the  district court did not  exclude Goudreau from\n\nthe special  verdict questions, which were given  to the jury\n\nin nearly  identical form  to the  Joint Request  for Special\n\nJury Questions submitted previously by the parties.   \n\n                             -40-\n\n          On appeal, Storage  Tank argues  that the  district\n\ncourt  committed reversible  error  by allowing  the jury  to\n\nassign liability to Goudreau because Goudreau was not a party\n\ndefendant  at trial.  It contends that the district court, by\n\nallowing  the  jury  to  apportion  fault  against  Goudreau,\n\nviolated  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    507:7-e, I(a) (1986), which\n\norders  the trial court to  \"[i]nstruct the jury to determine\n\n. . . the  amount of damages  to be awarded  to each claimant\n\nand  against   each   defendant  in   accordance   with   the\n\nproportionate fault of  each of the  parties.\"  Storage  Tank\n\ninterprets  this statute to mean that it is impermissible for\n\na  trial court to instruct  a jury to  find the proportionate\n\nfault of a non-party.   In this context, Storage  Tank argues\n\nthat Goudreau was not a party in its trial with Clausen, and,\n\ntherefore, the district court, by virtue of    507:7-e, I(a),\n\nerred  by instructing  the  jury to  apportion fault  against\n\nGoudreau.\n\n          Clausen   counters   Storage  Tank's   argument  by\n\nasserting that Storage Tank failed to preserve for appeal the\n\nissue that the district  court did not comply with  N.H. Rev.\n\nStat.  Ann.   507:7-e, I(a).  He points out that Storage Tank\n\nnot only  asked that Goudreau be included  in special verdict\n\nquestions  in the  parties'  Joint Request  for Special  Jury\n\nQuestions,  but also failed to object  to the special verdict\n\nquestions at any time during trial.  We agree with Clausen.\n\n                             -41-\n\n          Fed. R. Civ.

Refusal to File  Storage Tank's Renewed  Motion for\n                                                             \n          Judgment as a  Matter of Law and  Denial of Storage\n                                                             \n          Tank's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                                                       \n\n          At the end of evidence, Storage Tank filed a Motion\n\nfor Judgment as  a Matter  of Law, which  the district  court\n\n                    \n\n20.  The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has not addressed the\nissue and it  is unclear,  insofar as we  are aware,  whether\nthird-party defendants, who are not involved in the immediate\ntrial involving  the plaintiff  and the defendant(s),  are or\nare not \"parties\"  as that  term appears in  N.H. Rev.  Stat.\nAnn.   507:7-e.    \n\n                             -43-\n\ndenied.  Within ten days after the entry of judgment, Storage\n\nTank  filed, pursuant  to Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 50(b),  a Renewed\n\nMotion for Judgment  as a Matter of Law.   The district court\n\nrefused to file the later motion because it failed to include\n\na certificate  of compliance with  U.S. Dist. Ct.  R., D.N.H.\n\n11(b).21   On appeal, Storage  Tank assigns error  to both of\n\nthese decisions. \n\n          a.   Refusal to File Storage Tank's  Renewed Motion\n                                                             \n               for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n                                              \n\n          Storage  Tank initially contends  that the district\n\ncourt erred  in  refusing  to  file its  Renewed  Motion  for\n\nJudgment as a Matter  of Law for failure to comply  with U.S.\n\nDist.  Ct. R., D.N.H 11(b).  According to Storage Tank, Local\n\nRule 11 does not apply to  a Renewed Motion for Judgment as a\n\nMatter of Law.  We disagree.\n\n          U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  R., D.N.H.  11(a)(1)  states that\n\n\"[m]otions other than during trial will be considered only if\n                                  \n\nsubmitted separately from other pleadings on a document using\n\nthe word `Motion' in the  title.  The Clerk shall  not accept\n\n                    \n\n21.  District of New Hampshire Local Rule 11(b) states:\n\n     (b)  SEEKING CONCURRENCE IN MOTIONS\n\n          The moving  party shall  certify to  the court\n     that  he has  made a good  faith attempt  to obtain\n     concurrence in  the relief  sought.  If  the moving\n     party has obtained concurrence,  he shall so  state\n     in the body of the motion so the court may consider\n     it without delay.\n\n                             -44-\n\nany  motions not  in compliance  with procedures  outlined in\n\nthese Rules.\"   (emphasis  added).  Assuming,  arguendo, that\n                                                       \n\nthe phrase \"any motions\" in the second sentence of Local Rule\n\n11(a)(1)  means \"any  motions other  than during  trial,\" the\n\nissue  becomes whether  a Renewed  Motion for  Judgment as  a\n\nMatter of Law  is a  trial motion,  which is  not subject  to\n\nLocal Rule 11, or  a \"motion other than during  trial,\" which\n\nis subject to  Local Rule  11.  Like  the district court,  we\n\nconclude  that a Renewed Motion  for Judgment as  a Matter of\n\nLaw,  which may be filed as many  as ten days after the entry\n\nof  judgment, is a \"motion other than during trial\" that must\n\ncomply with the strictures of Local Rule 11(b).  Accordingly,\n\nthe  district court was entitled to enforce its local rule by\n\nrefusing to  file Storage Tank's Renewed  Motion for Judgment\n\nas a Matter of  Law, and we cannot say that,  by doing so, it\n\nengaged  in a clear injustice.

First,  it contends  that  Clausen's trial\n\n                             -46-\n\ntestimony unequivocally established  that he fell on  staging\n\nplanks  that   had  been  placed  over   the  existing  ramp.\n\nConsequently, Storage Tank maintains that, because it did not\n\neither  own or  control staging planks     or  receive notice\n\nthat staging planks had been placed over the existing ramp   \n\nthere was insufficient evidence  upon which a reasonable jury\n\ncould  have found  Storage Tank  negligent.

Clausen was injured on his first day on the\n\njob and on his first trip down the ramp.   He, therefore, had\n\nno prior  personal experience with the  slippery condition of\n\nthe ramp.  Moreover, Clausen testified that the one-half-inch\n\nsheet of  ice that caked the  ramp was concealed by  snow and\n\n                             -47-\n\nthat  nobody had  told him  prior to  the accident  about the\n\npresence of ice on the ramp.  Similarly unavailing is Storage\n\nTank's contention that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof  law because  it  did not  receive  notice of  the  ramp's\n\ndangerous  condition  or  an  opportunity  to  take  remedial\n\naction.  Because there  was evidence at trial from  which the\n\njury  could reasonably find that  Storage Tank knew or should\n\nhave known that ice and snow would accumulate on the ramp and\n\nthat Storage  Tank was responsible for taking action to clear\n\nthe ramp, the jury \"could likewise  find that reasonable care\n\nrequired that [Storage Tank]  should have taken such action.\"\n\nTremblay  v.

We  decline  to  disturb   the  district  court's\n\nconclusion that  Clausen presented evidence sufficient  for a\n\nreasonable jury to find Storage Tank negligent.  \n\n     2.
