Waterville  Industries, Inc.,\n                            \n\nbrought suit against the  Finance Authority of Maine (\"FAME\")\n\nseeking  contribution to  \"response  costs\" assessed  against\n\nWaterville  Industries by the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nunder the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation\n\nand  Liability Act  (\"CERCLA\"),  42 U.S.C.      9601 et  seq.\n                                                            \n\nFAME,  claiming the  protection  of  statutory exceptions  to\n\nCERCLA liability, appeals from the  district court's decision\n\nthat  it is  responsible  for  60  percent  of  those  costs.\n\nWaterville Industries cross-appeals from the district court's\n\nrefusal to order  FAME to contribute to its  attorneys' fees.\n\nWe  conclude  that FAME  is  exempt  from contribution  under\n\nCERCLA and  therefore do not reach  the cross-appeal relating\n\nto the amount of contribution.\n\n                              I.\n\n     This  action arises out of efforts to clean up two waste\n\nwater  lagoons   located  at   a  defunct  textile   mill  in\n\nWaterville,  Maine.   Although  the genesis  of  the mill  is\n\nneither  clear from the record  nor critical to  the case, it\n\nappears  that the  First Hartford  Corporation developed  the\n\nmill  in  the early  1970's with  state  assistance.1   In or\n\n                    \n\n     1First Hartford's  role was  carried out by  two related\ncorporations,  First Hartford Corporation  and First Hartford\nRealty Corporation; the  latter held  the lease  on the  real\nproperty  in  question but  subleased  it  to First  Hartford\nCorporation.   We refer  throughout the opinion  to the  dual\nenterprise as \"First Hartford.\"   \n\n                             -3-\n\nabout 1972, First Hartford acquired the  property, sold it to\n\nWaterville Textile Development Corporation --  a quasi-public\n\ncorporation unconnected with the appellee in this case -- and\n\nthen  leased it back.   Loans in connection  with the project\n\nwere made to First  Hartford by Society for Savings,  an out-\n\nof-state lender,  and secured  by mortgages on  the property,\n\nwhich Society for Savings held.  The loans were guaranteed by\n\nappellant FAME, an instrumentality of the state of Maine.2\n\n     In  1980, First Hartford defaulted  on the loans.   As a\n\nresult,  FAME  pursuant  to  its  guarantee  made substantial\n\npayments to Society for Savings to cure the defaults, assumed\n\nFirst Hartford's future obligations  to Society for  Savings,\n\nand received from the latter an assignment of the  mortgages.\n\nOn the  same day  that it  received the  mortgages, March 14,\n\n1980, FAME  accepted  a  deed  in lieu  of  foreclosure  from\n\nWaterville  Textile  Development Corporation  and  became the\n\nholder of title to the property.\n\n     On  the same day, FAME leased the property back to First\n\nHartford to allow First  Hartford to continue to  operate the\n\nmill.   The new lease required First Hartford to make monthly\n\npayments directly to Society for Savings to cover obligations\n\ncoming due on the original debt  which FAME had assumed.  The\n\n                    \n\n     2In 1972, FAME's functions were carried out by the Maine\nIndustrial  Building  Authority.    That  entity   was  later\nsucceeded by the Maine Guarantee Authority which was  in turn\nsucceeded by FAME.   In this opinion, we will  for simplicity\nrefer to the successive entities as \"FAME.\"\n\n                             -4-\n\nlease  also  required First  Hartford  to  pay an  additional\n\n$22,340 per month  directly to  FAME.  During  the period  in\n\nwhich First Hartford operated  the mill as a lessee  of FAME,\n\nFirst Hartford  released certain  hazardous  wastes into  two\n\nlagoons associated with the mill.  \n\n     First Hartford continued to experience financial trouble\n\nafter the March 14, 1980, transactions, and filed for Chapter\n\n11  bankruptcy  protection  on  February  20,  1981.    First\n\nHartford ceased  operations at the  mill on October  6, 1981.\n\nApparently a dispute then occurred between First Hartford and\n\nFAME as to  whether First Hartford had a  continuing interest\n\nin  the property.  This dispute was resolved in a \"settlement\n\nstipulation\"  approved by  the bankruptcy  court on  July 29,\n\n1982,  which provided  that \"title  to the  Real Property  is\n\nvested solely in [FAME],\" but which gave First Hartford until\n\nOctober 15, 1982, to find a buyer for the property. \n\n     First Hartford did not find a buyer by October 15, 1982,\n\nand  on  or about  March 29,  1983,  FAME contracted  with an\n\nauctioneer  to sell  the property.   An  auction was  held on\n\nAugust  19, 1983, and  MKY Realty  was the  high bidder.   On\n\nSeptember 23,  1983,  FAME  and  MKY Realty  entered  into  a\n\ncontract  for the sale of  the property, and  on November 15,\n\n1983,  FAME conveyed  the  property to  Gano Industries,  the\n\nnominee of  MKY Realty.   Gano Industries  later changed  its\n\nname to Waterville Industries, the appellee in this case.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                             II.\n\n     In  September  1988,  the  EPA  filed an  administrative\n\ncomplaint against Waterville Industries seeking penalties and\n\nresponse costs  under CERCLA in connection  with the clean-up\n\nof  the lagoons.    As the  current  owner of  the  property,\n\nWaterville  Industries was  liable for  such costs  under the\n\nstatute.   42  U.S.C.    9607(a)(1).   Waterville  Industries\n\nentered into a  consent agreement  with EPA to  clean up  the\n\nproperty.  It has  now incurred substantial engineering costs\n\nin  connection with  the clean-up,  and further  expenses are\n\nexpected.   Waterville Industries  then  brought this  action\n\npursuant to CERCLA   contending that FAME, as a  former owner\n\nof the property,  is liable  for contribution.   42 U.S.C.   \n\n9613(f)  (authorizing contribution action  against \"any other\n\nperson  who is  liable  or potentially  liable\" for  clean-up\n\ncosts).\n\n     CERCLA holds  several categories of  persons liable  for\n\nthe clean-up of hazardous substances at a facility, including\n\n\"any  person who  at the  time of  disposal of  any hazardous\n\nsubstance  owned  or  operated  any facility  at  which  such\n\nhazardous  substances  were  disposed  of[.]\"   42  U.S.C.   \n\n9607(a)(2).  Waterville Industries argues that FAME is liable\n\nfor contribution  because  it \"owned\"  the  property  between\n\nMarch 14,  1980,  and  October  6, 1981,  during  which  time\n\nhazardous substances were released  into the lagoons by First\n\n                             -6-\n\nHartford.   The statute, however, contains  exceptions to the\n\ndefinition of  an \"owner,\"  one of which  excludes from  that\n\nstatus  \"a   person,  who,  without   participating  in   the\n\nmanagement  of  a  vessel   or  facility,  holds  indicia  of\n\nownership primarily  to protect his security  interest in the\n\nvessel or facility.\"  42 U.S.C.   9601(20)(A).\n\n     FAME  has contended  throughout the  litigation that  it\n\nfalls  within  this security  interest exception  from CERCLA\n\nliability.  Waterville Industries' main response is that when\n\nFAME  accepted a  deed in  lieu of  foreclosure on  March 14,\n\n1980, it \"became the owner in fee simple of the land, and the\n\nmortgages merged  into the  deed and  disappeared.\"   At that\n\npoint,  Waterville Industries  argues, FAME  no longer  had a\n\n\"security interest\"  to protect  because it was  the outright\n\nowner  of the  property, and  therefore the  secured creditor\n\nexception  by its  terms became  inapplicable.   The district\n\ncourt accepted this reasoning, holding:\n\n     From March 14, 1980,  to October 6, 1981 [the  date\n     First  Hartford ceased  operations,] [FAME]  was an\n     owner with a leasehold relationship to the operator\n     and  was during  that time  no longer  protecting a\n     security interest as it might have been had it been\n     a mortgagee or as  it might have done prior  to its\n     taking the March 14, 1980, deed.\n\n     Our  own  analysis  begins  with   the  construction  of\n\nCERCLA's security  interest  exception, plainly  an issue  of\n\n                             -7-\n\nlaw.3    The  purpose of  the  exception,  apparent from  its\n\nlanguage  and  the  statutory  context,  is  to  shield  from\n\nliability those  \"owners\" who are in  essence lenders holding\n\ntitle to the property as security for the debt.  Congress may\n\nhave been concerned with maintaining sources of credit or may\n\nhave thought  that CERCLA's far-reaching liability  should be\n\nlimited to those owners  who had the real equity  interest in\n\nthe  property.  In  all events, legislative  history and case\n\nlaw  confirm that Congress had  in mind not  only the classic\n\ncase of the bank mortgage but also equivalent devices serving\n\nthe same function, such as lease financing arrangements.4\n\n     Our review  of the  record persuades  us that  what FAME\n\nreceived  from  Waterville  Textile  Development  Corporation\n\nthrough  the March  14,  1980, transactions  was the  nominal\n\ntitle typical of the lender in a lease financing transaction.\n\nWaterville Textile Development Corporation was a quasi-public\n\ndevelopment  corporation used  in  connection with  the  1972\n\nloans  in order to hold  title to the  property; it purchased\n\n                    \n\n     3In  this  case,  we  have accepted  the  trial  court's\nfindings of fact,  as supplemented by other facts  drawn from\nthe record.  In re Crown Sportswear,  Inc., 575 F.2d 991, 993\n                                          \n(1st Cir. 1978).\n\n     4See H.R.  Rep. No. 172, pt. 1, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 36\n         \n(1979)  (an \"owner\"  does not  include a person  who \"hold[s]\ntitle  . . . in connection with a lease financing arrangement\nunder  the appropriate banking  laws, rules or regulations\");\nIn  re  Bergsoe Metal  Corp., 910  F.2d  668 (9th  Cir. 1991)\n                            \n(lease financing is a security interest under CERCLA).\n\n                             -8-\n\nthe  property from First Hartford  for $1 and  then leased it\n\nback  to First  Hartford.   That  lease  in turn  gave  First\n\nHartford an option  to buy the property for $1  at the end of\n\nthe  lease (or,  based on formula  payments, even  before the\n\nlease  expired if  it  chose).   This  is an  ordinary  lease\n\nfinancing arrangement, commonly called a sale and lease back.\n\nSee, e.g., In re PCH Assocs., 949 F.2d 585, 599-600 (2d  Cir.\n                            \n\n1991).\n\n     When  FAME   acquired  title  from   Waterville  Textile\n\nDevelopment Corporation on March 14, 1980, it  simultaneously\n\nre-leased  the  property  to  First  Hartford,  altering  the\n\npayment terms as already described.  But the new lease, which\n\nis  part of  the  record,  also  provides that  \"[e]xcept  as\n\nmodified  or referred to by  the terms of  this Agreement, in\n\nall  other  respects,  the  Underlying  Leases  and  Sublease\n\nbetween  [Waterville  Textile] Development,  [First Hartford]\n\nRealty and  First  Hartford shall  remain in  full force  and\n\neffect.\"   Thus, First  Hartford's  payment obligations  were\n\naltered but its option to buy the property for $1 remained in\n\nforce and  the lease  financing character of  the transaction\n\nremained unchanged.\n\n     The  payments required  under  the new  March 14,  1980,\n\nlease reinforce our conclusion.  First Hartford was committed\n\nto continue  payments to Society  for Savings just  as before\n\nand also  to  make  monthly payments  of  just  over  $22,000\n\n                             -9-\n\ndirectly to  FAME.  Although Waterville  Industries points to\n\nthe  latter  payment  as  \"profits\"  inconsistent   with  the\n\nsupposed passive- lender  role of FAME, the  lease shows that\n\nthe total payments were to be limited to $868,982.   We think\n\nthe  fair inference  from  this  limitation  supports  FAME's\n\nexplanation that  the payments to  it were intended  to repay\n\nFAME for its own  payments to Society for Savings  made under\n\nthe guarantee in order to cure First  Hartford's own default.\n\nThere are yet other signs that FAME's interest  was that of a\n\nsecurity holder.5\n\n     We  think that  the able  district  judge may  have been\n\nmisled on the security  interest issue by the failure  of the\n\nparties  to  develop the  precise  rights  of First  Hartford\n\nunder the March 14, 1980,  lease, including (by incorporation\n\nof  the original 1972 lease)  the option to  purchase for $1.\n\nAlthough   the   security  interest   exception   was  argued\n\nvigorously on both sides  in this court, the facts as  to the\n\noption are  not mentioned  in the briefs.   If  FAME had  re-\n\nleased  the property  to Waterville  Industries on  March 14,\n\n1980,  without continuing  the purchase  option, our  line of\n\nanalysis would be different and FAME's current position could\n\nbe weaker.  \n\n                    \n\n     5For example, First Hartford continued to be responsible\nfor real estate taxes and the payment schedule  provided that\nthe  monthly sums payable to FAME were to be applied first to\n\"interest,\" which suggests repayment of a debt.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     Our  view of the matter  accords with that  of the Ninth\n\nCircuit in  In re Bergsoe Metal Corp., 910 F.2d 668 (9th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991).   There the court upheld the exemption claim under the\n\nsecurity interest exception of a titular owner who held title\n\nto  property merely  as  security  in  a  sale-and-lease-back\n\ntransaction.    While  there are  factual  distinctions,  the\n\nholding and thrust  of the case supports FAME's exempt status\n\nin the  year following March 14, 1980.  We note also that EPA\n\nhas recently adopted regulations declaring that  the security\n\ninterest exception  applies to \"title held  pursuant to lease\n\nfinancing transactions.\"  40  C.F.R.   300.1100(b)(1).  These\n\nregulations do not govern for they were not in  effect at the\n\ntime  of the events in this case.6   Since our reading of the\n\nstatute  on this issue does not rest upon the regulations, we\n\nneed not resolve arguments between the parties concerning the\n\nweight to be accorded to the EPA's views.\n\n     The more difficult problem for FAME is  its status under\n\nthe  exemption after  October  6, 1981,  when First  Hartford\n                    \n\nceased  operation.     Thereafter--precisely  when  is   less\n\ncertain--First Hartford presumably lost  its rights under the\n\nlease and,  as sometimes happens to  security holders, FAME's\n\ntitular ownership became real and no longer merely a security\n\n                    \n\n     6The regulations are currently under review in the D. C.\nCircuit in cases not yet briefed or argued.  Michigan v. EPA,\n                                                            \nC.A.

However, we  think such a maturation  of ownership\n\ndoes  not  divest  the  owner of  protection  under  CERCLA's\n\nsecurity  interest exception  so long  as the  owner proceeds\n\nwithin  a reasonable time to divest itself of ownership.  Why\n\nthis is so, and how FAME then fares under this reading of the\n\nstatute,  are separate  questions  which we  address in  that\n\norder.\n\n     Admittedly,  CERCLA itself  does not  explicitly provide\n\nany period  for divestiture after the collapse of a financing\n\narrangement, but such a \"safety zone\" seems to us implicit in\n\nthe  statute.  Were  it otherwise, every  sale and lease-back\n\narrangement would  subject the  lender-lessor to the  risk of\n\nsudden CERCLA  liability whenever  the lessee, by  default or\n\notherwise,  lost  its  contractual   rights  to  regain  full\n\nownership.   So long as the  lender-lessor makes a reasonably\n\nprompt effort to divest itself of its unwelcome ownership, we\n\nthink continued coverage under the exception serves its basic\n\npolicy:  to protect  bona fide lenders and to  avoid imposing\n\nliability on \"owners\" who  are not in fact seeking  to profit\n\nfrom   the  investment  opportunity   normally  presented  by\n\nprolonged  ownership.  The sparse  case law on  this point is\n\ndivided with  two decisions  supporting our approach  and one\n\nopposed.7  \n\n                    \n\n     7Supporting our  view are United States  v.

Ohio\n                \n\n                             -12-\n\n     EPA has followed the  same path in its  new regulations.\n\nIt  provides  a safe  harbor of  12  months within  which the\n\nsecurity  interest  holder  may  take  title  and  offer  the\n\nproperty  for sale,  noting that one  who delays  longer \"may\n\nstill be able to show that it has acted consistently with the\n\nexemption .  . . .\"   57 Fed.  Reg. 18,344, 18,364  (Apr. 29,\n\n1992).       Again,  we   have  reached  our  own  conclusion\n\nindependently of the  regulations, which  technically do  not\n\napply to pre-adoption events.   Certainly EPA's choice of  12\n\nmonths  for its safe harbor cannot govern this case, for such\n\nbright-line  rules make  sense  only when  known to  affected\n\nparties  in  advance.   Instead,  we  think the  question  is\n\nwhether, under  all the circumstances, FAME  acted reasonably\n\npromptly  to  divest  itself  of  ownership  once  the  lease\n\narrangement ended.\n\n     The  earliest  time that  one  would  expect a  security\n\nholder to start to divest itself of unwelcome ownership would\n\nordinarily be  when the  security holder obtained  full title\n\nfree of serious encumbrances.  So long as First Hartford held\n\na lease  with an option to buy for  $1, FAME was still only a\n\n                    \n\n1985).    At  odds  with  our  approach  is  Guidice  v.

First Hartford\n\nfiled for Chapter 11 reorganization on February 20, 1981, and\n\nceased operation of  the mill on October 6, 1981.   FAME then\n\nfiled an application in  the bankruptcy proceeding seeking an\n\norder declaring  it the owner  of the property  and directing\n\nFirst  Hartford  to   surrender  possession;  First  Hartford\n\nopposed  the application.  Not until July 15, 1982, did First\n\nHartford  and FAME  enter into  a stipulation  that \"affirmed\n\nthat  title to the real property was vested solely in [FAME's\n\npredecessor] and terminated the  rights of First Hartford and\n\nFirst Hartford  Realty in  the various leases.\"8   Even  then\n\nFirst  Hartford was given until  October 15, 1982,  to seek a\n\nbuyer for the property.\n\n     Thus,  it was only after October 15, 1982, that FAME was\n\nfinally  in a position to give  an unclouded and unencumbered\n\ntitle to a purchaser.  Within  six months of that date,  FAME\n\nhad  contracted (in late  March 1983)  with an  auctioneer to\n\nsell  the property.    After  an  auction,  FAME  agreed  (in\n\nSeptember  1983)  to sell  the  property to  MKY  Realty, the\n\nsuccessful  auction bidder,  and it  conveyed title  not long\n\nafterwards (in  November 1983).   Based  on this  sequence of\n\n                    \n\n     8The  stipulation  provided  that  \"First  Hartford  and\nRealty waive any and  all rights or claims to be declared the\nlegal  or  equitable owner  of  the  real property.\"    First\nHartford was also granted a right to the proceeds of any sale\nso far as they exceeded a specified sum,  apparently computed\nto approximate  FAME's  own past  and  pending debts  on  the\nguarantees.  \n\n                             -14-\n\nevents,  we  think it  is  apparent that  FAME  made diligent\n\nefforts to dispose of the property in a timely fashion: until\n\nOctober 1981,  FAME had only  a security interest;  a quarrel\n\nover  First Hartford's interest delayed matters until October\n\n1982; and within  six months thereafter, FAME  had placed the\n\nproperty on the market leading to its sale within the year.\n\n                             III.\n\n     In conclusion, we are satisfied based on the record that\n\nFAME is  fully protected by the  security interest exception.\n\nWaterville Industries  complains bitterly in  its brief  that\n\nFAME sold it  the property through MKY Realty  without making\n\nfull  disclosure of  the hazardous  wastes or  of notices  of\n\nviolation  sent to  FAME,  and there  is separate  litigation\n\nbetween  the parties  on  this subject.    But the  right  of\n\ncontribution under CERCLA is a statutory one that  here turns\n\nsolely on FAME's status  as an \"owner,\" a status  defeated by\n\nthe  security  interest  exception.    Waterville Industries'\n\nother claims  against FAME, whatever their  nature or merits,\n\nare a matter for another forum.\n\n     Having resolved the case  based on the security interest\n\nexception, we do not  reach FAME's separate claim that  it is\n\nalso protected  by the provision exempting a  state unit that\n\nacquires  ownership \"involuntarily  . .  . by  virtue of  its\n\nfunction  as sovereign.\"    42 U.S.C.     9601(20)(D).   This\n\nexemption, which  the district  court rejected on  the ground\n\n                             -15-\n\nthat   the  acquisition  was  voluntary,  presents  difficult\n\nproblems   of  interpretation  that   we  need  not  address.\n\nSimilarly, our reversal of the award of contribution makes it\n\nunnecessary   to  consider  the  cross-appeal  of  Waterville\n\nIndustries   seeking  attorneys'   fees  as   part   of  that\n\ncontribution.\n\n     Reversed.\n             \n\n                             -16-\n",

Although  the genesis  of  the mill  is\n\nneither  clear from the record  nor critical to  the case, it\n\nappears  that the  First Hartford  Corporation developed  the\n\nmill  in  the early  1970's with  state  assistance.1   In or\n\n                    \n\n     1First Hartford's  role was  carried out by  two related\ncorporations,  First Hartford Corporation  and First Hartford\nRealty Corporation; the  latter held  the lease  on the  real\nproperty  in  question but  subleased  it  to First  Hartford\nCorporation.   We refer  throughout the opinion  to the  dual\nenterprise as \"First Hartford.\"   \n\n                             -3-\n\nabout 1972, First Hartford acquired the  property, sold it to\n\nWaterville Textile Development Corporation --  a quasi-public\n\ncorporation unconnected with the appellee in this case -- and\n\nthen  leased it back.   Loans in connection  with the project\n\nwere made to First  Hartford by Society for Savings,  an out-\n\nof-state lender,  and secured  by mortgages on  the property,\n\nwhich Society for Savings held.  The loans were guaranteed by\n\nappellant FAME, an instrumentality of the state of Maine.2\n\n     In  1980, First Hartford defaulted  on the loans.   As a\n\nresult,  FAME  pursuant  to  its  guarantee  made substantial\n\npayments to Society for Savings to cure the defaults, assumed\n\nFirst Hartford's future obligations  to Society for  Savings,\n\nand received from the latter an assignment of the  mortgages.\n\nOn the  same day  that it  received the  mortgages, March 14,\n\n1980, FAME  accepted  a  deed  in lieu  of  foreclosure  from\n\nWaterville  Textile  Development Corporation  and  became the\n\nholder of title to the property.\n\n     On  the same day, FAME leased the property back to First\n\nHartford to allow First  Hartford to continue to  operate the\n\nmill.   The new lease required First Hartford to make monthly\n\npayments directly to Society for Savings to cover obligations\n\ncoming due on the original debt  which FAME had assumed.  The\n\n                    \n\n     2In 1972, FAME's functions were carried out by the Maine\nIndustrial  Building  Authority.    That  entity   was  later\nsucceeded by the Maine Guarantee Authority which was  in turn\nsucceeded by FAME.   In this opinion, we will  for simplicity\nrefer to the successive entities as \"FAME.\"\n\n                             -4-\n\nlease  also  required First  Hartford  to  pay an  additional\n\n$22,340 per month  directly to  FAME.  During  the period  in\n\nwhich First Hartford operated  the mill as a lessee  of FAME,\n\nFirst Hartford  released certain  hazardous  wastes into  two\n\nlagoons associated with the mill.  \n\n     First Hartford continued to experience financial trouble\n\nafter the March 14, 1980, transactions, and filed for Chapter\n\n11  bankruptcy  protection  on  February  20,  1981.    First\n\nHartford ceased  operations at the  mill on October  6, 1981.\n\nApparently a dispute then occurred between First Hartford and\n\nFAME as to  whether First Hartford had a  continuing interest\n\nin  the property.  This dispute was resolved in a \"settlement\n\nstipulation\"  approved by  the bankruptcy  court on  July 29,\n\n1982,  which provided  that \"title  to the  Real Property  is\n\nvested solely in [FAME],\" but which gave First Hartford until\n\nOctober 15, 1982, to find a buyer for the property. \n\n     First Hartford did not find a buyer by October 15, 1982,\n\nand  on  or about  March 29,  1983,  FAME contracted  with an\n\nauctioneer  to sell  the property.   An  auction was  held on\n\nAugust  19, 1983, and  MKY Realty  was the  high bidder.   On\n\nSeptember 23,  1983,  FAME  and  MKY Realty  entered  into  a\n\ncontract  for the sale of  the property, and  on November 15,\n\n1983,  FAME conveyed  the  property to  Gano Industries,  the\n\nnominee of  MKY Realty.   Gano Industries  later changed  its\n\nname to Waterville Industries, the appellee in this case.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                             II.\n\n     In  September  1988,  the  EPA  filed an  administrative\n\ncomplaint against Waterville Industries seeking penalties and\n\nresponse costs  under CERCLA in connection  with the clean-up\n\nof  the lagoons.    As the  current  owner of  the  property,\n\nWaterville  Industries was  liable for  such costs  under the\n\nstatute.   42  U.S.C.    9607(a)(1).   Waterville  Industries\n\nentered into a  consent agreement  with EPA to  clean up  the\n\nproperty.  It has  now incurred substantial engineering costs\n\nin  connection with  the clean-up,  and further  expenses are\n\nexpected.   Waterville Industries  then  brought this  action\n\npursuant to CERCLA   contending that FAME, as a  former owner\n\nof the property,  is liable  for contribution.   42 U.S.C.   \n\n9613(f)  (authorizing contribution action  against \"any other\n\nperson  who is  liable  or potentially  liable\" for  clean-up\n\ncosts).\n\n     CERCLA holds  several categories of  persons liable  for\n\nthe clean-up of hazardous substances at a facility, including\n\n\"any  person who  at the  time of  disposal of  any hazardous\n\nsubstance  owned  or  operated  any facility  at  which  such\n\nhazardous  substances  were  disposed  of[.]\"   42  U.S.C.   \n\n9607(a)(2).  Waterville Industries argues that FAME is liable\n\nfor contribution  because  it \"owned\"  the  property  between\n\nMarch 14,  1980,  and  October  6, 1981,  during  which  time\n\nhazardous substances were released  into the lagoons by First\n\n                             -6-\n\nHartford.   The statute, however, contains  exceptions to the\n\ndefinition of  an \"owner,\"  one of which  excludes from  that\n\nstatus  \"a   person,  who,  without   participating  in   the\n\nmanagement  of  a  vessel   or  facility,  holds  indicia  of\n\nownership primarily  to protect his security  interest in the\n\nvessel or facility.\"  42 U.S.C.   9601(20)(A).\n\n     FAME  has contended  throughout the  litigation that  it\n\nfalls  within  this security  interest exception  from CERCLA\n\nliability.  Waterville Industries' main response is that when\n\nFAME  accepted a  deed in  lieu of  foreclosure on  March 14,\n\n1980, it \"became the owner in fee simple of the land, and the\n\nmortgages merged  into the  deed and  disappeared.\"   At that\n\npoint,  Waterville Industries  argues, FAME  no longer  had a\n\n\"security interest\"  to protect  because it was  the outright\n\nowner  of the  property, and  therefore the  secured creditor\n\nexception  by its  terms became  inapplicable.   The district\n\ncourt accepted this reasoning, holding:\n\n     From March 14, 1980,  to October 6, 1981 [the  date\n     First  Hartford ceased  operations,] [FAME]  was an\n     owner with a leasehold relationship to the operator\n     and  was during  that time  no longer  protecting a\n     security interest as it might have been had it been\n     a mortgagee or as  it might have done prior  to its\n     taking the March 14, 1980, deed.\n\n     Our  own  analysis  begins  with   the  construction  of\n\nCERCLA's security  interest  exception, plainly  an issue  of\n\n                             -7-\n\nlaw.3    The  purpose of  the  exception,  apparent from  its\n\nlanguage  and  the  statutory  context,  is  to  shield  from\n\nliability those  \"owners\" who are in  essence lenders holding\n\ntitle to the property as security for the debt.  Congress may\n\nhave been concerned with maintaining sources of credit or may\n\nhave thought  that CERCLA's far-reaching liability  should be\n\nlimited to those owners  who had the real equity  interest in\n\nthe  property.  In  all events, legislative  history and case\n\nlaw  confirm that Congress had  in mind not  only the classic\n\ncase of the bank mortgage but also equivalent devices serving\n\nthe same function, such as lease financing arrangements.4\n\n     Our review  of the  record persuades  us that  what FAME\n\nreceived  from  Waterville  Textile  Development  Corporation\n\nthrough  the March  14,  1980, transactions  was the  nominal\n\ntitle typical of the lender in a lease financing transaction.\n\nWaterville Textile Development Corporation was a quasi-public\n\ndevelopment  corporation used  in  connection with  the  1972\n\nloans  in order to hold  title to the  property; it purchased\n\n                    \n\n     3In  this  case,  we  have accepted  the  trial  court's\nfindings of fact,  as supplemented by other facts  drawn from\nthe record.

But the new lease, which\n\nis  part of  the  record,  also  provides that  \"[e]xcept  as\n\nmodified  or referred to by  the terms of  this Agreement, in\n\nall  other  respects,  the  Underlying  Leases  and  Sublease\n\nbetween  [Waterville  Textile] Development,  [First Hartford]\n\nRealty and  First  Hartford shall  remain in  full force  and\n\neffect.\"   Thus, First  Hartford's  payment obligations  were\n\naltered but its option to buy the property for $1 remained in\n\nforce and  the lease  financing character of  the transaction\n\nremained unchanged.\n\n     The  payments required  under  the new  March 14,  1980,\n\nlease reinforce our conclusion.  First Hartford was committed\n\nto continue  payments to Society  for Savings just  as before\n\nand also  to  make  monthly payments  of  just  over  $22,000\n\n                             -9-\n\ndirectly to  FAME.  Although Waterville  Industries points to\n\nthe  latter  payment  as  \"profits\"  inconsistent   with  the\n\nsupposed passive- lender  role of FAME, the  lease shows that\n\nthe total payments were to be limited to $868,982.   We think\n\nthe  fair inference  from  this  limitation  supports  FAME's\n\nexplanation that  the payments to  it were intended  to repay\n\nFAME for its own  payments to Society for Savings  made under\n\nthe guarantee in order to cure First  Hartford's own default.\n\nThere are yet other signs that FAME's interest  was that of a\n\nsecurity holder.5\n\n     We  think that  the able  district  judge may  have been\n\nmisled on the security  interest issue by the failure  of the\n\nparties  to  develop the  precise  rights  of First  Hartford\n\nunder the March 14, 1980,  lease, including (by incorporation\n\nof  the original 1972 lease)  the option to  purchase for $1.\n\nAlthough   the   security  interest   exception   was  argued\n\nvigorously on both sides  in this court, the facts as  to the\n\noption are  not mentioned  in the briefs.   If  FAME had  re-\n\nleased  the property  to Waterville  Industries on  March 14,\n\n1980,  without continuing  the purchase  option, our  line of\n\nanalysis would be different and FAME's current position could\n\nbe weaker.  \n\n                    \n\n     5For example, First Hartford continued to be responsible\nfor real estate taxes and the payment schedule  provided that\nthe  monthly sums payable to FAME were to be applied first to\n\"interest,\" which suggests repayment of a debt.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     Our  view of the matter  accords with that  of the Ninth\n\nCircuit in  In re Bergsoe Metal Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991).   There the court upheld the exemption claim under the\n\nsecurity interest exception of a titular owner who held title\n\nto  property merely  as  security  in  a  sale-and-lease-back\n\ntransaction.    While  there are  factual  distinctions,  the\n\nholding and thrust  of the case supports FAME's exempt status\n\nin the  year following March 14, 1980.  We note also that EPA\n\nhas recently adopted regulations declaring that  the security\n\ninterest exception  applies to \"title held  pursuant to lease\n\nfinancing transactions.\"  40  C.F.R.   300.1100(b)(1).  These\n\nregulations do not govern for they were not in  effect at the\n\ntime  of the events in this case.6   Since our reading of the\n\nstatute  on this issue does not rest upon the regulations, we\n\nneed not resolve arguments between the parties concerning the\n\nweight to be accorded to the EPA's views.\n\n     The more difficult problem for FAME is  its status under\n\nthe  exemption after  October  6, 1981,  when First  Hartford\n                    \n\nceased  operation.     Thereafter--precisely  when  is   less\n\ncertain--First Hartford presumably lost  its rights under the\n\nlease and,  as sometimes happens to  security holders, FAME's\n\ntitular ownership became real and no longer merely a security\n\n                    \n\n     6The regulations are currently under review in the D. C.\nCircuit in cases not yet briefed or argued.  Michigan v. EPA,\n                                                            \nC.A.

However, we  think such a maturation  of ownership\n\ndoes  not  divest  the  owner of  protection  under  CERCLA's\n\nsecurity  interest exception  so long  as the  owner proceeds\n\nwithin  a reasonable time to divest itself of ownership.  Why\n\nthis is so, and how FAME then fares under this reading of the\n\nstatute,  are separate  questions  which we  address in  that\n\norder.\n\n     Admittedly,  CERCLA itself  does not  explicitly provide\n\nany period  for divestiture after the collapse of a financing\n\narrangement, but such a \"safety zone\" seems to us implicit in\n\nthe  statute.  Were  it otherwise, every  sale and lease-back\n\narrangement would  subject the  lender-lessor to the  risk of\n\nsudden CERCLA  liability whenever  the lessee, by  default or\n\notherwise,  lost  its  contractual   rights  to  regain  full\n\nownership.   So long as the  lender-lessor makes a reasonably\n\nprompt effort to divest itself of its unwelcome ownership, we\n\nthink continued coverage under the exception serves its basic\n\npolicy:  to protect  bona fide lenders and to  avoid imposing\n\nliability on \"owners\" who  are not in fact seeking  to profit\n\nfrom   the  investment  opportunity   normally  presented  by\n\nprolonged  ownership.  The sparse  case law on  this point is\n\ndivided with  two decisions  supporting our approach  and one\n\nopposed.7  \n\n                    \n\n     7Supporting our  view are United States  v.

Reg. 18,344, 18,364  (Apr. 29,\n\n1992).       Again,  we   have  reached  our  own  conclusion\n\nindependently of the  regulations, which  technically do  not\n\napply to pre-adoption events.   Certainly EPA's choice of  12\n\nmonths  for its safe harbor cannot govern this case, for such\n\nbright-line  rules make  sense  only when  known to  affected\n\nparties  in  advance.   Instead,  we  think the  question  is\n\nwhether, under  all the circumstances, FAME  acted reasonably\n\npromptly  to  divest  itself  of  ownership  once  the  lease\n\narrangement ended.\n\n     The  earliest  time that  one  would  expect a  security\n\nholder to start to divest itself of unwelcome ownership would\n\nordinarily be  when the  security holder obtained  full title\n\nfree of serious encumbrances.

First Hartford\n\nfiled for Chapter 11 reorganization on February 20, 1981, and\n\nceased operation of  the mill on October 6, 1981.   FAME then\n\nfiled an application in  the bankruptcy proceeding seeking an\n\norder declaring  it the owner  of the property  and directing\n\nFirst  Hartford  to   surrender  possession;  First  Hartford\n\nopposed  the application.  Not until July 15, 1982, did First\n\nHartford  and FAME  enter into  a stipulation  that \"affirmed\n\nthat  title to the real property was vested solely in [FAME's\n\npredecessor] and terminated the  rights of First Hartford and\n\nFirst Hartford  Realty in  the various leases.\"8   Even  then\n\nFirst  Hartford was given until  October 15, 1982,  to seek a\n\nbuyer for the property.\n\n     Thus,  it was only after October 15, 1982, that FAME was\n\nfinally  in a position to give  an unclouded and unencumbered\n\ntitle to a purchaser.  Within  six months of that date,  FAME\n\nhad  contracted (in late  March 1983)  with an  auctioneer to\n\nsell  the property.    After  an  auction,  FAME  agreed  (in\n\nSeptember  1983)  to sell  the  property to  MKY  Realty, the\n\nsuccessful  auction bidder,  and it  conveyed title  not long\n\nafterwards (in  November 1983).   Based  on this  sequence of\n\n                    \n\n     8The  stipulation  provided  that  \"First  Hartford  and\nRealty waive any and  all rights or claims to be declared the\nlegal  or  equitable owner  of  the  real property.\"    First\nHartford was also granted a right to the proceeds of any sale\nso far as they exceeded a specified sum,  apparently computed\nto approximate  FAME's  own past  and  pending debts  on  the\nguarantees.  \n\n                             -14-\n\nevents,  we  think it  is  apparent that  FAME  made diligent\n\nefforts to dispose of the property in a timely fashion: until\n\nOctober 1981,  FAME had only  a security interest;  a quarrel\n\nover  First Hartford's interest delayed matters until October\n\n1982; and within  six months thereafter, FAME  had placed the\n\nproperty on the market leading to its sale within the year.\n\n                             III.\n\n     In conclusion, we are satisfied based on the record that\n\nFAME is  fully protected by the  security interest exception.\n\nWaterville Industries  complains bitterly in  its brief  that\n\nFAME sold it  the property through MKY Realty  without making\n\nfull  disclosure of  the hazardous  wastes or  of notices  of\n\nviolation  sent to  FAME,  and there  is separate  litigation\n\nbetween  the parties  on  this subject.    But the  right  of\n\ncontribution under CERCLA is a statutory one that  here turns\n\nsolely on FAME's status  as an \"owner,\" a status  defeated by\n\nthe  security  interest  exception.    Waterville Industries'\n\nother claims  against FAME, whatever their  nature or merits,\n\nare a matter for another forum.\n\n     Having resolved the case  based on the security interest\n\nexception, we do not  reach FAME's separate claim that  it is\n\nalso protected  by the provision exempting a  state unit that\n\nacquires  ownership \"involuntarily  . .  . by  virtue of  its\n\nfunction  as sovereign.\"    42 U.S.C.     9601(20)(D).   This\n\nexemption, which  the district  court rejected on  the ground\n\n                             -15-\n\nthat   the  acquisition  was  voluntary,  presents  difficult\n\nproblems   of  interpretation  that   we  need  not  address.\n\nSimilarly, our reversal of the award of contribution makes it\n\nunnecessary   to  consider  the  cross-appeal  of  Waterville\n\nIndustries   seeking  attorneys'   fees  as   part   of  that\n\ncontribution.\n\n     Reversed.\n             \n\n                             -16-\n</pre>",
