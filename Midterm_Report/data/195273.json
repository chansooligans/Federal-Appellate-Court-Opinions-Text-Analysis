This is  a petition for  review of  a\n                    \n\ndecision  of the  Board of  Immigration  Appeals.   The Board\n\naffirmed  the  decision  of  an  immigration  judge  ordering\n\ndeportation made during an in absentia hearing.\n                                      \n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Petitioner,  Eugene  Henry  Abasiri,   entered  the\n\nUnited States in 1981 on a student visa.  In  1984, he agreed\n\nto  his removal from  this country  after being  charged with\n\nviolating the conditions of his student visa (he had ended up\n\ngoing to school part-time  and working part-time).   The form\n\nhe signed  specified that he was  prohibited from re-entering\n\nthe United States  for five years absent  permission from the\n\nAttorney General.   Nonetheless, Abasiri obtained  a visa and\n\nreturned in 1985.\n\n          He then married a United States citizen and applied\n\nfor  an adjustment  of  his status  to  that of  a  permanent\n\nresident under   245 of the Immigration  and Nationality Act,\n\n8  U.S.C.   1255.   This request for  permanent residence was\n\ndenied and, in December 1987, the INS issued an order to show\n\ncause why Abasiri should not be deported under   241(a)(1), 8\n\nU.S.C.     1251(a)(1), based  on the  fact  that when  he re-\n\nentered the United  States in 1985 he was among  the class of\n\naliens  excludable as a matter of law.  His excludability, in\n\nturn, was based on    212(a)(17), 8 U.S.C.    1182(a)(17), as\n\nan alien who had  failed to obtain permission to  return from\n\nthe Attorney General.\n\n          At  the  first  hearing  in  May  1988,   Abasiri's\n\nattorney admitted the allegations in the show cause order and\n\nconceded Abasiri's  deportability.  Counsel then withdrew and\n\nAbasiri appeared  pro se at a  hearing in May 1989.   At this\n\ntime, an extension  of time was  granted and the  immigration\n\njudge  warned Abasiri that Abasiri would have to obtain a new\n\nlawyer or appear at  the next hearing prepared to  go forward\n\non his own.   After securing new counsel, a  hearing was held\n\nin December  1989  at which  counsel  stated that  she  would\n\npursue applications for adjustment of status and for advanced\n\npermission  to  return to  an  unrelinquished  domicile.   To\n\nenable counsel to present evidence about Abasiri's family and\n\nhis  moral character,  the hearing  was adjourned  until 1:00\n\np.m. on November 19, 1990.\n\n          However,  on  November  8,  1990,  counsel  filed a\n\nmotion to  withdraw based on  the breakdown of  the attorney-\n\nclient relationship.  In her motion,  counsel stated that, in\n\na  June 1990  conversation and  in  a letter  dated September\n\n1990, she  had informed Abasiri  that she wanted  to withdraw\n\nfrom  the case  and  that she  had  conveyed to  Abasiri  the\n\nserious consequences that might follow  should he not show up\n\nat the November 19th  hearing.  She also stated  that Abasiri\n\nhad spoken to another attorney regarding representation.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          The hearing  began at  1:00 p.m. on  November 19th.\n\nAt 1:35 p.m., the  immigration judge noted Abasiri's absence.\n\nHe also stated that Abasiri could not be found in the waiting\n\nroom or in the adjoining hall and that no one  had heard from\n\nAbasiri or anyone else on his behalf.  On request of the INS,\n\nand after noting that Abasiri had been provided with adequate\n\nnotice of the  hearing, the  judge agreed to  an in  absentia\n                                                             \n\nhearing.  He then found Abasiri deportable under    241(a)(1)\n\nand 212(a)(17) -- the  original charges on which Abasiri  had\n\nconceded  deportability.   The  judge stated  that he  viewed\n\nAbasiri's  \"failure  to  appear  as  an  abandonment  of  any\n\napplications for relief that were before this Court.\"\n\n          Abasiri then secured a  third attorney who filed an\n\nappeal from  the decision  of the immigration  judge ordering\n\nhim  deported.  According to  the INS, no  briefs were filed.\n\nThus,  the  only reason  given was  stated  on the  notice of\n\nappeal form:   \"Appellant  was under the  mistaken impression\n\nthat he was represented by prior Counsel on 11/19/90 and as a\n\nresult  he  did  not appear  at  that  hearing.\"   The  Board\n\ndismissed  the  appeal.   It  held  that Abasiri's  \"mistaken\n\nimpression\"  concerning  continuing  representation by  prior\n\ncounsel did not provide \"reasonable cause\" for his failure to\n\nappear at the November 19th hearing.\n\n                             -4-\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n     The  law concerning in absentia hearings is contained in 8\n                                    \n\nU.S.C.   1252(b):\n\n          If  any alien has been given a reasonable\n          opportunity to be present at a proceeding\n          under    this   section,    and   without\n          reasonable  cause  fails  or  refuses  to\n          attend . . . such proceeding, the special\n          inquiry   officer   may   proceed  to   a\n          determination  in like  manner as  if the\n          alien were present.\n\nWe review a  decision of  the Board which  affirms a  deportation\n\norder made during an in absentia hearing for abuse of discretion.\n                              \n\nSee  Thomas  v. INS,  976  F.2d  786, 789  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (per\n                 \n\ncuriam).  That  is, only  if the  decision \"`was  made without  a\n\nrational  explanation,  inexplicably  departed  from  established\n\npolicies, or  rested on an impermissible basis,'\" will we reverse\n\nthe Board.  See Leblanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685, 693 (1st Cir. 1983)\n                            \n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          We  believe  that  the  outcome  of  this  appeal  is\n\ncontrolled  by Thomas.   In Thomas,  petitioner and  his attorney\n                                \n\nappeared thirty  minutes late  for a  deportation hearing.   This\n\noccurred due to  confusion over where they were to  meet prior to\n\nthe  hearing.    The  immigration  judge,  after  waiting  twenty\n\nminutes, ordered the deportation of petitioner in absentia.  When\n                                                        \n\nThomas  and his  attorney appeared  ten minutes later,  the judge\n\nrefused to hear the matter even though he had scheduled two hours\n\nfor the hearing.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          We held that the Board's decision was not \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"  See 976 F.2d at 789.  We\n                                          \n\nemphasized  that both  petitioner  and his  counsel had  received\n\nnotice of the  hearing over  five months prior  to its  scheduled\n\ndate.  Further, there  was no evidence that counsel  had notified\n\nthe judge's chambers that they would be late, nor had petitioner,\n\nwho  was  waiting at  the  courthouse, entered  the  courtroom to\n\nannounce his presence.\n\n          Abasiri argues on appeal that \"reasonable  cause\" for\n\nhis failure to appear exists based on \"miscommunication\" with his\n\nprior lawyer.  In  an affidavit, appended to Abasiri's  brief, he\n\nfirst  admits that he received a letter from counsel on September\n\n12,  1990 informing him that  she would no  longer represent him.\n\nHowever, he then states that he  called her and during the course\n\nof the phone  call he \"believed\"  that she would continue  as his\n\nlawyer.   He represents  that he did  appear for the  hearing but\n\nleft before it commenced  because counsel was not there.   Had he\n\nknown  that she  was  not coming,  he  concludes, he  would  have\n\nretained a lawyer to represent him at the hearing.\n\n          The  first problem with this argument is that most of\n\nthese facts were  not presented to the Board.   As such, they are\n\nwaived.   See Thomas, 976 F.2d  at 789; Alleyne v.  INS, 879 F.2d\n                                                     \n\n1177, 1182 (3d Cir. 1989) (issues not presented to  the Board may\n\nnot be raised for first time  in petition for review).  Thus, the\n\nonly question is whether his \"mistaken impression\" concerning the\n\n                             -6-\n\nstatus of his attorney-client relationship  meets the \"reasonable\n\ncause\" standard.\n\n          We do not  think that, under our  decision in Thomas,\n                                                              \n\nAbasiri  has  demonstrated   reasonable  cause.     According  to\n\ncounsel's motion  to withdraw, she  apprised Abasiri of  the date\n\nand time of  the next hearing  and \"fully  informed [him] of  the\n\nimportance of appearing  at this hearing  and the consequence  of\n\nhis failure to do so.\"   Further, as Abasiri had appeared  pro se\n\nat  an earlier  hearing  when he  was  \"between\" counsel,  it  is\n\nreasonable  to have expected him to do likewise on November 19th.\n\nFinally, unlike  Thomas, where  counsel  and petitioner  actually\n                     \n\nappeared  at the hearing albeit  late, Abasiri made  no effort to\n\neven notify the  judge's chambers concerning  the reason for  his\n\nabsence.   \"An in absentia deportation is legitimate if the alien\n                        \n\nhad  a reasonable opportunity to be present and failed to provide\n\nreasonable  cause for his absence.\"   Maldonado-Perez v. INS, 865\n                                                          \n\nF.2d 328, 333 (D.C. Cir.  1989); Sewak v. INS, 900 F.2d  667, 672\n                                           \n\n(3d Cir.  1990) (alien may not  complain if he has  notice of the\n\nhearing and voluntarily fails to appear).  Here, Abasiri received\n\nadequate  notice and his failure to appear was without reasonable\n\ncause.    Thus,  the  Board  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in\n\ndismissing Abasiri's appeal.\n\n          Because this  petition for review does  not present a\n\nsubstantial question,  we summarily dismiss  it.  See  Local Rule\n                                                   \n\n27.1.\n\n                             -7-\n",

As such, they are waived.   See Thomas, 976 F.2d at 789;   Alleyne v. INS, 879 F.2d 1177, 1182 (3d Cir. 1989) (issues not presented to the Board may not be raised for first time in petition for review).

According to counsel's motion to withdraw, she apprised Abasiri of the date and time of the next hearing and \"fully informed [him] of the importance of appearing at this hearing and the consequence of his failure to do so.\"  Further, as Abasiri had appeared pro se at an earlier hearing when he was \"between\" counsel, it is reasonable to have expected him to do likewise on November 19th.  Finally, unlike Thomas, where counsel and petitioner actually appeared at the hearing albeit late, Abasiri made no effort to even notify the judge's chambers concerning the reason for his absence.  \"An in absentia deportation is legitimate if the alien had a reasonable opportunity to be present and failed to provide reasonable cause for his absence.\"   Maldonado-Perez v.

Here, Abasiri received adequate notice and his failure to appear was without reasonable cause.  Thus, the Board did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Abasiri's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this petition for review does not present a substantial question, we summarily dismiss it.

The Board affirmed the decision of an immigration judge ordering deportation made during an in absentia hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner, Eugene Henry Abasiri, entered the United States in 1981 on a student visa.  In 1984, he agreed to his removal from this country after being charged with violating the conditions of his student visa (he had ended up going to school part-time and working part-time).  The form he signed specified that he was prohibited from re-entering the United States for five years absent permission from the Attorney General.  Nonetheless, Abasiri obtained a visa and returned in 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He then married a United States citizen and applied for an adjustment of his status to that of a permanent resident under Sec. 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1255.  This request for permanent residence was denied and, in December 1987, the INS issued an order to show cause why Abasiri should not be deported under Sec. 241(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(1), based on the fact that when he re-entered the United States in 1985 he was among the class of aliens excludable as a matter of law.  His excludability, in turn, was based on Sec. 212(a)(17), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(17), as an alien who had failed to obtain permission to return from the Attorney General.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first hearing in May 1988, Abasiri's attorney admitted the allegations in the show cause order and conceded Abasiri's deportability.  Counsel then withdrew and Abasiri appeared pro se at a hearing in May 1989.  At this time, an extension of time was granted and the immigration judge warned Abasiri that Abasiri would have to obtain a new lawyer or appear at the next hearing prepared to go forward on his own.  After securing new counsel, a hearing was held in December 1989 at which counsel stated that she would pursue applications for adjustment of status and for advanced permission to return to an unrelinquished domicile.  To enable counsel to present evidence about Abasiri's family and his moral character, the hearing was adjourned until 1:00 p.m.  on November 19, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, on November 8, 1990, counsel filed a motion to withdraw based on the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.  In her motion, counsel stated that, in a June 1990 conversation and in a letter dated September 1990, she had informed Abasiri that she wanted to withdraw from the case and that she had conveyed to Abasiri the serious consequences that might follow should he not show up at the November 19th hearing.  She also stated that Abasiri had spoken to another attorney regarding representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing began at 1:00 p.m.  on November 19th.  At 1:35 p.m., the immigration judge noted Abasiri's absence.  He also stated that Abasiri could not be found in the waiting room or in the adjoining hall and that no one had heard from Abasiri or anyone else on his behalf.  On request of the INS, and after noting that Abasiri had been provided with adequate notice of the hearing, the judge agreed to an in absentia hearing.  He then found Abasiri deportable under Secs. 241(a)(1) and 212(a)(17)-the original charges on which Abasiri had conceded deportability.  The judge stated that he viewed Abasiri's \"failure to appear as an abandonment of any applications for relief that were before this Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abasiri then secured a third attorney who filed an appeal from the decision of the immigration judge ordering him deported.  According to the INS, no briefs were filed.  Thus, the only reason given was stated on the notice of appeal form: \"Appellant was under the mistaken impression that he was represented by prior Counsel on 11/19/90 and as a result he did not appear at that hearing.\"  The Board dismissed the appeal.  It held that Abasiri's \"mistaken impression\" concerning continuing representation by prior counsel did not provide \"reasonable cause\" for his failure to appear at the November 19th hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law concerning in absentia hearings is contained in 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1252(b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If any alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding under this section, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend ... such proceeding, the special inquiry officer may proceed to a determination in like manner as if the alien were present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a decision of the Board which affirms a deportation order made during an in absentia hearing for abuse of discretion.   See Thomas v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592072\"><a href=\"/opinion/592072/philip-thomas-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span>, 789 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).  That is, only if the decision \" 'was made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis,' \" will we reverse the Board.   See Leblanc v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423902\"><a href=\"/opinion/423902/thomas-leblanc-and-marie-margaret-leblanc-v-immigration-and-naturalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 693 (1st Cir. 1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the outcome of this appeal is controlled by Thomas.  In Thomas, petitioner and his attorney appeared thirty minutes late for a deportation hearing.  This occurred due to confusion over where they were to meet prior to the hearing.  The immigration judge, after waiting twenty minutes, ordered the deportation of petitioner in absentia.  When Thomas and his attorney appeared ten minutes later, the judge refused to hear the matter even though he had scheduled two hours for the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held that the Board's decision was not \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"  See 976 F.2d at 789.  We emphasized that both petitioner and his counsel had received notice of the hearing over five months prior to its scheduled date.  Further, there was no evidence that counsel had notified the judge's chambers that they would be late, nor had petitioner, who was waiting at the courthouse, entered the courtroom to announce his presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abasiri argues on appeal that \"reasonable cause\" for his failure to appear exists based on \"miscommunication\" with his prior lawyer.  In an affidavit, appended to Abasiri's brief, he first admits that he received a letter from counsel on September 12, 1990 informing him that she would no longer represent him.  However, he then states that he called her and during the course of the phone call he \"believed\" that she would continue as his lawyer.  He represents that he did appear for the hearing but left before it commenced because counsel was not there.  Had he known that she was not coming, he concludes, he would have retained a lawyer to represent him at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first problem with this argument is that most of these facts were not presented to the Board.  As such, they are waived.   See Thomas, 976 F.2d at 789;   Alleyne v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526456\"><a href=\"/opinion/526456/erskine-alleyne-v-united-states-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1182 (3d Cir. 1989) (issues not presented to the Board may not be raised for first time in petition for review).  Thus, the only question is whether his \"mistaken impression\" concerning the status of his attorney-client relationship meets the \"reasonable cause\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that, under our decision in Thomas, Abasiri has demonstrated reasonable cause.
