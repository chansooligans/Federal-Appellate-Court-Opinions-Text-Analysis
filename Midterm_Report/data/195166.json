Appellant claims  that Footnote* should be\n\ndisregarded in favor of the \"market-oriented\" approach supposedly\n\napproved  in Chapman v.  United States,     U.S.     , 111 S.

See 21  U.S.C.   841(b).   Indeed, the  Court in Chapman\n                                                                 \n\nspecifically  adverted to  the  \"either/or\" sentencing  treatment\n\nprescribed in methamphetamine (and PCP) cases, and concluded that\n\n\"Congress knew  how to indicate that the  weight of the pure drug\n\nwas to be used to determine  the sentence, and did not make  that\n\n                                2\n\ndistinction with  respect to LSD.\"   Chapman, 111 S.  Ct. at 1924\n                                            \n\n(emphasis  added).    The  \"market-oriented\"  approach  appellant\n\ninfers from  Chapman would  blunt the power  of Congress  to pre-\n                    \n\nscribe criminal sanctions and frustrate its mandate  in 21 U.S.C.\n\n  841(b)(1)(A)(iv),(viii) &amp;  (B)(iv),(viii), as well  as U.S.S.G.\n\n  2D1.1(c) and the plain language of Footnote*.

We therefore  reaffirm Stoner and\n                                                             \n\naffirm the sentence imposed by the district court.1\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant's remaining  claim  is that  the  district  court\nerred in  not departing downward  based on the  \"unusual\" circum-\nstance that he  was sentenced in accordance  with U.S.S.G.   2D1-\n.1(c) and Footnote*.
