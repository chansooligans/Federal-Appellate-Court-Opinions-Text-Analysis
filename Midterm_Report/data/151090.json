Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                      Lipez, Howard and Thompson,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Eugene F. Rector on brief pro se.\n     Kristin J. Cole, Department of Correction and Nancy Ankers\nWhite, Special Assistant Attorney General, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                               July 20, 2010\n\f           Per Curiam.   Eugene F. Rector has appealed the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of his civil action, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted.   Rector, civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person\n\nto   the    Massachusetts    Treatment     Center   in   Bridgewater,\n\nMassachusetts, alleged that the double-bunking in that facility\n\nviolated his Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process.     We review\n\na district court's sua sponte dismissal, de novo.           Gonzalez-\n\nGonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).      Upon\n\nde novo review, we affirm.\n\n           On appeal, Rector contends that the district court erred\n\nin dismissing his complaint without giving him an opportunity to\n\namend that complaint.    However, Rector had notice of the defect in\n\nhis complaint.   His 2009 federal complaint was identical to his\n\nprior 2006 federal complaint. And, in 2006, the district court had\n\nalerted Rector to the defect in that complaint, i.e., that he had\n\nnot alleged that he had been harmed or was in danger of being\n\nharmed because of double-bunking.      Moreover, in 2006, the district\n\ncourt had advised Rector on how to remedy that defect, i.e., to\n\ninclude \"truthful allegations concerning the manner in which the\n\ndouble-bunking is harmful to him personally\" and had specifically\n\ngiven Rector the opportunity to file an amended complaint.     Rector\n\ndeclined that opportunity.    Instead, Rector first filed the same\n\ninsufficient complaint in 2007 in state court, where he lost (for\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthe same reason), and then filed the identical defective complaint\n\nonce more in 2009 in federal court.          Clearly, Rector did not lack\n\nnotice of the defect of his complaint and the district court did\n\nnot err in concluding that, Rector having filed the same defective\n\ncomplaint twice more after such notice, it need not give Rector\n\nanother opportunity to amend.\n\n            As a second argument, Rector contends that he does not\n\nneed to demonstrate any actual harm and cites to cases which, for\n\nexample, hold that prisons have an obligation to protect inmates\n\nfrom   threats   from   fellow   prisoners    or   \"sufficiently    imminent\n\ndangers.\"   This avails Rector nothing since he specifically stated\n\nthat he was not being threatened or intimidated.         He also cites to\n\n(1) a 1987 case from the District of Idaho that directed that\n\nsingle cells were constitutionally required for inmates housed in\n\na unit for psychological treatment in a particular prison due to\n\ntreatment needs and personal safety and (2) a 1983 case from the\n\nDistrict    of   Wisconsin   that   held   that,    although   it   was    not\n\nunconstitutional     in   general    to    double-cell    prisoners       with\n\npsychological problems, it was cruel and unusual punishment to\n\nforce a non-suicidal inmate to share a cell with a suicidal inmate.\n\nRector, however, presents nothing to suggest that either his\n\ntreatment needs or his personal safety requires a single cell, or\n\nthat he is being coerced to share a cell with a suicidal inmate.\n\nMoreover, whatever the current validity of these directives, these\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcases are not precedent for us and predate our decision in Cote v.\n\nMurphy,   2005   WL   2708221,   152    Fed.   Appx.   6   (1st    Cir.   2005)\n\n(unpublished per curiam).        Rector makes no persuasive argument\n\nsuggesting that Cote is no longer good law.\n\n           Rector failed to address, in his main brief, the district\n\ncourt's alternative grounds for dismissal, i.e., that the action is\n\nbarred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, as well as res judicata. He\n\ndiscusses these grounds for the first time only in his reply brief.\n\nFor that reason, Rector's contentions are waived.                 Sandstrom v.\n\nChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990) (reciting that\n\narguments not made in the opening brief are waived).             In any event,\n\nRector's arguments are meritless.\n\n           The   district   court      order   of   dismissal,     entered   on\n\nDecember 1, 2009, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
