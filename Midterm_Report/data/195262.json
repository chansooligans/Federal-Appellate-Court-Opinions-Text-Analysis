Stephen  and Lois  Pustell\r                                             \n\nbrought this  action challenging the constitutionality  of a Lynn\n\nSchool Committee  requirement that  conditions the approval  of a\n\nhomeschooling   plan   on  consent   to   home   visits  by   the\n\nsuperintendent or his representative.   The district court upheld\n\nthe constitutionality  of the  requirement, and the  Pustells now\n\nappeal.   Our review of the  record and the  caselaw persuades us\n\nthat the  district court  should have abstained  until issues  of\n\nstate law were resolved.   We therefore vacate its  judgment, and\n\nremand for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n                      I.  Factual Background\r                                                      \n\n     Plaintiffs  Stephen  and Lois  Pustell  are  the parents  of\n\nGeneva  Marie  Pustell, whom  they  are  educating  at  home,  in\n\naccordance  with their religious  beliefs.  The  Pustells live in\n\nthe Lynn, Massachusetts school district.  Massachusetts state law\n\ngrants  discretion to  local  school districts  to determine  the\n\nstandards  for home schooling.  See Care &amp; Protection of Charles,\r                                                                          \n\n504 N.E.2d  592, 399 Mass. 324  (Mass. 1987).  As  a condition of\n\napproval of  a home  instruction  plan, the  Lynn Public  Schools\n\nrequire,  among  other things,  that  parents  give their  signed\n\nconsent to a  home visit by the superintendent or his designee to\n\n\"observe and evaluate the instructional process.\"\n\n     In November, 1991, the Pustells met with  Dr. Louis Perullo,\n\nthe  assistant  superintendent of  the  Lynn  Public Schools,  to\n\ndiscuss their homeschooling plans.  At that meeting, the Pustells\n\nobjected  to the  school district's  home visit  requirement, and\n\n                               -2-\r\n\noffered an alternative consent form eliminating this requirement.\n\nDr. Perullo rejected the substitution, and told the Pustells that\n\nthe school district would not approve their home instruction plan\n\nabsent their written  consent to periodic  home visits by  school\n\nofficials.   The Pustells refused  to offer this  consent, and on\n\nNovember  21, 1991 the Lynn  school committee voted  not to allow\n\nthe Pustells to educate their daughter at home.\n\n     The Pustells then brought suit, claiming that the home visit\n\npolicy violated their First Amendment  right to the free exercise\n\nof their religion, their  Fourth Amendment right to be  free from\n\nunreasonable searches, their substantive due process  right under\n\nthe  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  oversee the  education  of  their\n\nchildren,   and   various   provisions   of   the   Massachusetts\n\nconstitution.   They  sought declaratory  and  injunctive relief.\n\nThe  district court  granted summary  judgment for  the defendant\n\nschool district, and this appeal followed.\n\n     At oral argument, the panel questioned whether this case was\n\njusticiable and, if  it were,  whether it was  appropriate for  a\n\nfederal court to decide the case  at this juncture.1  Pointing to\n\nthe district court's  statement that it was  \"unclear whether the\n\nPustells'  child  is currently  being educated  at  home or  in a\n\ntraditional  school  setting\"  and  that \"no  criminal  or  civil\n\nproceedings are  currently pending against the  Pustells based on\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The court  may raise issues of  jurisdiction and abstention\nsua  sponte.    Texas  v.  Florida,  306  U.S.  398,  405  (1939)\r                                            \n(jurisdiction);  Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 143 n.10 (1976)\r                                            \n(abstention).\n\n                               -3-\r\n\ntheir  refusal to  submit  to  periodic  home visits,\"  we  first\n\nexpressed concern that  this case  was unripe, and  that we  were\n\nbeing asked for an advisory opinion.  We  then noted that several\n\nfactors made abstention a compelling option.  \n\n     After argument, we allowed  the parties to file supplemental\n\nbriefs addressing the questions of justiciability and abstention.\n\nWe  now  conclude   that  there   is  a   justiciable  \"case   or\n\ncontroversy,\" but  that the  circumstances of this  case make  it\n\nappropriate for application of the abstention doctrine enunciated\n\nin Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941).\r                                               \n\n                       II.  Justiciability\r                                                    \n\n     The Pustells claim that the case is reviewable because their\n\ncomplaint alleged, and  defendants admitted, that  their daughter\n\nis  being taught at  home.   Nothing in  the record  suggests the\n\ncontrary.2   We  therefore  proceed on  the  assumption that  the\n\nPustells currently are homeschooling.\n\n     This does not fully  resolve our concerns, however.   For us\n\nto  assume  jurisdiction,  there   must  be  an  actual,  ongoing\n\ncontroversy between the parties.  See  U.S. Const. art. III,   2,\r                                               \n\ncl.  1;  Federal  Declaratory  Judgment Act,  28  U.S.C.     2201\n\n(jurisdiction to award declaratory relief exists only in  \"a case\n\nof actual  controversy\").   Some indication that  the controversy\n\nhas a concrete  impact on the parties is  also necessary before a\n\ncase is ripe for  adjudication.  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner,\r                                                                          \n                    \r                              \n\n     2We  note, in addition, that sworn  affidavits from Lois and\nStephen  Pustell, dated March  11, 1992, declaring  that they are\nhomeschooling their daughter, are part of the appendix.  \n\n                               -4-\r\n\n387  U.S. 136,  148-49  (1967).3   If,  for example,  the  record\n\nindicated  that the  town of  Lynn never  planned to  take action\n\nagainst  the Pustells,  and  had never  taken enforcement  action\n\nagainst  other parents in a  similar situation, we arguably would\n\nbe put in the position  of issuing an advisory opinion.   Cf. Poe\r                                                                           \n\nv. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 501-09 (1961) (finding a case unripe for\r                   \n\nadjudication  of constitutionality  of state  statutes  where the\n\nlack of any  evidence that, with the exception of  one test case,\n\nthe statutes had ever been enforced, even in the face  of actions\n\nviolating  the  statutes,  demonstrated  the  state's  policy  of\n\nnullification of these laws).   \n\n     Although  the issue  is  close, we  are  satisfied that  the\n\ncontroversy between  the parties here is  sufficiently actual and\n\nconcrete that jurisdiction is proper.   The Pustells continue  to\n\nteach their child at home, despite the school committee's refusal\n\nto  approve their home instruction  plan.  By  refusing to comply\n\nwith the  policy, while continuing to  homeschool their daughter,\n\nthe Pustells face possible  sanctions.  See Mass. Gen.

The \"fitness\" inquiry asks whether\r                     \nthe challenged action is final,  and whether the issue  presented\nis purely legal,  rather than  in need of  more concrete  factual\ndevelopment.   Id.  Under \"hardship,\" the court considers whether\r                            \nthe  impact  of the  challenged  action  \"creates a  `direct  and\nimmediate'  dilemma for  the  parties, requiring  them to  choose\nbetween  costly  compliance and  noncompliance,  at  the risk  of\npunishment.\"   W.R.

The  dispute between  the  parties is  therefore\n\nconcrete, and not hypothetical or abstract.\n\n     No  further  factual  development  is necessary  for  us  to\n\nresolve  the  question  at  issue,  namely,  whether  the  policy\n\nrequiring home visits  is constitutional.  The issue is therefore\n\n\"fit\" for judicial resolution.  See Abbott Lab., 387 U.S. at 149.\r                                                         \n\nFinally,  the town  has,  in  fact,  already  acted  against  the\n\nPustells by rejecting their  home instruction plan and officially\n\nbarring them from teaching their daughter at home.  Regardless of\n\nthe  imminence  of  an  enforcement  action,  the  Pustells  will\n\ncontinue  to suffer the harm of substantial uncertainty if we put\n\noff resolving their  constitutional claims.  We  believe they are\n\nentitled  to know whether they may continue to school their child\n\nat   home   without   risking   sanctions.

Nevertheless, certain\r                \n\nexceptional circumstances  warrant abstention by a  federal court\n\nfrom  the  exercise of  its  proper jurisdiction.    See Colorado\r                                                                           \n\nRiver, 424 U.S. at 813-17, 818-19 (detailing such circumstances).\r               \n\nUnder Railroad  Commission v.

Because the federal court's\n\ndecision in  these circumstances \"cannot escape  being a forecast\n\nrather than  a determination,\" abstention is  justified to \"avoid\n\nthe waste  of a tentative decision  as well as the  friction of a\n\npremature constitutional adjudication.\"  Id. at 499-500.  In this\r                                                      \n\nway,  the Pullman  abstention doctrine  serves the  dual aims  of\r                           \n\navoiding  advisory  constitutional  decisionmaking,  as  well  as\n\npromoting  the principles  of comity  and federalism  by avoiding\n                    \r                              \n\n     4Our  conclusion  that  the  case  is  ripe  does  not mean,\nnecessarily,  that  the  timing  is  appropriate  for  injunctive\nrelief.  The decision to grant an injunction involves a number of\nadditional  factors.   See,  e.g., Planned  Parenthood League  of\r                                                                           \nMassachusetts v.

This  law,\n\nwhich  requires  children to  attend  public  or private  school,\n\nexempts  a child \"who is  being otherwise instructed  in a manner\n\napproved  in   advance  by  the  superintendent   or  the  school\n\ncommittee.\"   Id.

This\npractice  would  cede control  of  litigation  to litigants,  and\ninterfere with our duty to avoid unnecessary friction with states\nin the regulation of  their own affairs, see Pullman, 312  U.S at\r                                                              \n500,  as well  as our  duty to  avoid unnecessary  constitutional\nadjudication, see  Ashwander v.  Tennessee Valley  Authority, 297\r                                                                      \nU.S. 288, 345-48 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). \n\n     6Thus, the  regulations themselves do not explicitly require\nhome  visits.    The regulation  that  the  school committee  has\ninterpreted to require home visits reads as follows:  \n     The [homeschooling] Plan must include a detailed description\n     of the following: . . . \n\n                               -8-\r\n\n     Under  the regulations,  the parents must  sign a  Letter of\n\nAgreement giving permission to the superintendent or his designee\n\nto \"periodically observe  and evaluate the instructional  process\n\nand to verify that the Home Instruction provided is in accordance\n\nwith the Home Instruction Plan as authorized by the Committee . .\n\n.  .\"  The school  committee has interpreted  the observation and\n\nevaluation component to require a pre-arranged home visit once or\n\ntwice a year for 40-45 minutes. \n\n     The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial  Court has held that \"the\n\napproval of a  home school  proposal must not  be conditioned  on\n\nrequirements  that are  not essential  to the  State interest  in\n\nensuring  that `all  the children  shall be  educated.'\"   Care &amp;\r                                                                           \n\nProtection of Charles,  504 N.E.2d  at 600.   The court  observed\r                               \n\nthat   requiring  periodic  standardized   testing,  or  periodic\n\nprogress  reports or  dated  work  samples,  in  lieu  of  formal\n\ntesting,  would be  acceptable ways  to evaluate  the educational\n\nprogress of children being schooled at home.  Id. at 601.  \r                                                           \n\n     Whether  home  visits  may  be  required  as  part  of  this\n\nevaluation process  is unsettled, however.  In  Care &amp; Protection\r                                                                           \n\nof  Charles, the  court stated  that \"[w]ith  appropriate testing\r                     \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     A  Statement of  Agreement that  the parent  will  allow the\n     Superintendent  (or   designee,  i.e.,  the   Principal)  to\n     periodically:\n\n          1.   assess the child's  mastery of subject  matter and\n          skills in the same manner used by the school system.\n\n          2.  observe and  evaluate the instructional process and\n          to  verify  that the  Home  Instruction  Plan is  being\n          implemented as authorized by the Committee.\n\n                               -9-\r\n\nprocedures or progress reports, there may be no need for periodic\n\non-site  visits or  observations of  the learning  environment by\n\nschool authority personnel,\" id.  The court, however, immediately\r                                          \n\nadded  \"But see  Matter of  Kilroy.\"   In that  case, a  New York\r                                            \n\nfamily court  upheld  a home  visit requirement  as necessary  to\n\nevaluate home instruction to  school age children.  467  N.Y.S.2d\n\n318 (1983).  These conflicting references  suggest that the court\n\ndeliberately  left  unresolved  whether   home  visits  could  be\n\nrequired under Massachusetts law. \n\n     It  has yet  to be determined,  therefore, whether  the Lynn\n\nSchool Committee's interpretation of the evaluation  component of\n\nits regulations, which conditions approval of home instruction on\n\nhome visits, is  authorized by  state law.   If, as the  Pustells\n\nargue,  home visits \"are not  essential to the  State interest in\n\nensuring  that `all  the children  shall be educated,'\"  then the\n\nschool  committee  could  not   condition  the  approval  of  the\n\nPustells'  home school proposal on an agreement to home visits --\n\neven  to infrequent and pre-arranged  home visits.   Yet the Lynn\n\nSchool  Committee's interpretation  of  the requirements  of  the\n\nMassachusetts  compulsory  education  act  is  equally plausible,\n\nparticularly  given the reference to  Matter of Kilroy  in Care &amp;\r                                                                           \n\nProtection of Charles.\r                               \n\n     A dispositive state court interpretation of this issue could\n\neliminate entirely the need to address the constitutional issues.\n\nIf the Pustells' interpretation of state law were accepted by the\n\nstate   court,  the  school  district  would  have  to  allow  an\n\n                               -10-\r\n\nalternative to home visits.   This would spare us  from rendering\n\nan advisory opinion  on the constitutional issues.   See Pullman,\r                                                                          \n\n312 U.S. at 499-501; see also Catlin v. Ambach, 820 F.2d 588, 591\r                                                        \n\n(2d Cir. 1987).  \n\n     Our decision that abstention is appropriate here is affected\n\nby another consideration.  Although federal courts are capable of\n\nresolving state law  issues, educational  policy is  a matter  of\n\nparticularly  local concern.   See Care &amp;  Protection of Charles,\r                                                                          \n\n504  N.E.2d at 598 (noting that the details of educational policy\n\nadopted by the Massachusetts state  legislature historically have\n\nbeen left to  the control  of the people  in each  municipality).\n\nThe  question of what information local  school officials need in\n\norder  to  evaluate  whether  homeschoolers  are  being  educated\n\nadequately is best  resolved by  those closer to  the issue  than\n\nfederal  court judges.  We therefore think it preferable to allow\n\nthe Massachusetts courts to complete the analysis begun in Care &amp;\r                                                                           \n\nProtection of Charles rather than to intervene.  This would allow\r                               \n\nfor the development  of an informative record  about the efficacy\n\nof various assessment practices.  Moreover, any decision by  this\n\ncourt about  whether Lynn's  home visit  policy is  authorized by\n\nstate law would be, at best, provisional, as the last word on the\n\nlegality  of Lynn's policy under  Massachusetts law lies with the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme  Judicial  Court, and  not  with us.    See\r                                                                           \n\nPullman, 312 U.S. at 499-500.\r                 \n\n     We  decline to  create  \"needless friction\"  with state  and\n\nlocal policies,  id.  at 500,  by  preempting the  state  court's\r                              \n\n                               -11-\r\n\nadjudication of the Pustells'  claims.

The district court upheld the constitutionality of the requirement, and the Pustells now appeal.  Our review of the record and the caselaw persuades us that the district court should have abstained until issues of state law were resolved.  We therefore vacate its judgment, and remand for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Stephen and Lois Pustell are the parents of Geneva Marie Pustell, whom they are educating at home, in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The Pustells live in the Lynn, Massachusetts school district.  Massachusetts state law grants discretion to local school districts to determine the standards for home schooling.  See Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 399 Mass. 324, 504 N.E.2d 592 (1987).  As a condition of approval of a home instruction plan, the Lynn Public Schools require, among other things, that parents give their signed consent to a home visit by the superintendent or his designee to \"observe and evaluate the instructional process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1991, the Pustells met with Dr. Louis Perullo, the assistant superintendent of the Lynn Public Schools, to discuss their homeschooling plans.  At that meeting, the Pustells objected to the school district's home visit requirement, and offered an alternative consent form eliminating this requirement.  Dr. Perullo rejected the substitution, and told the Pustells that the school district would not approve their home instruction plan absent their written consent to periodic home visits by school officials.  The Pustells refused to offer this consent, and on November 21, 1991 the Lynn school committee voted not to allow the Pustells to educate their daughter at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pustells then brought suit, claiming that the home visit policy violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of their religion, their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches, their substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to oversee the education of their children, and various provisions of the Massachusetts constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant school district, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the panel questioned whether this case was justiciable and, if it were, whether it was appropriate for a federal court to decide the case at this juncture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Pointing to the district court's statement that it was \"unclear whether the Pustells' child is currently being educated at home or in a traditional school setting\" and that \"no criminal or civil proceedings are currently pending against the Pustells based on their refusal to submit to periodic home visits,\" we first expressed concern that this case was unripe, and that we were being asked for an advisory opinion.  We then noted that several factors made abstention a compelling option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After argument, we allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the questions of justiciability and abstention.  We now conclude that there is a justiciable \"case or controversy,\" but that the circumstances of this case make it appropriate for application of the abstention doctrine enunciated in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Justiciability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pustells claim that the case is reviewable because their complaint alleged, and defendants admitted, that their daughter is being taught at home.  Nothing in the record suggests the contrary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  We therefore proceed on the assumption that the Pustells currently are homeschooling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not fully resolve our concerns, however.  For us to assume jurisdiction, there must be an actual, ongoing controversy between the parties.  See U.S. Const. Art.  III, Sec. 2, cl. 1;  Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201 (jurisdiction to award declaratory relief exists only in \"a case of actual controversy\").  Some indication that the controversy has a concrete impact on the parties is also necessary before a case is ripe for adjudication.  Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515-16, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  If, for example, the record indicated that the town of Lynn never planned to take action against the Pustells, and had never taken enforcement action against other parents in a similar situation, we arguably would be put in the position of issuing an advisory opinion.  Cf. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 501-09, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1754-59, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (finding a case unripe for adjudication of constitutionality of state statutes where the lack of any evidence that, with the exception of one test case, the statutes had ever been enforced, even in the face of actions violating the statutes, demonstrated the state's policy of nullification of these laws).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the issue is close, we are satisfied that the controversy between the parties here is sufficiently actual and concrete that jurisdiction is proper.  The Pustells continue to teach their child at home, despite the school committee's refusal to approve their home instruction plan.  By refusing to comply with the policy, while continuing to homeschool their daughter, the Pustells face possible sanctions.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 76, Sec. 2 (West Supp.1993) (empowering state to initiate truancy proceedings against parents of children absent from school for seven full days);  Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 119, Sec. 24 (West Supp.1993) (empowering any person (including a town) to initiate civil proceedings on behalf of children without \"necessary and proper physical or education care and discipline,\" in order to compel education for such children, and, if appropriate, to remove the children from the custody of their parents);  see also Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 399 Mass. 324, 504 N.E.2d 592 (1987).  The dispute between the parties is therefore concrete, and not hypothetical or abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No further factual development is necessary for us to resolve the question at issue, namely, whether the policy requiring home visits is constitutional.  The issue is therefore \"fit\" for judicial resolution.  See Abbott Lab., 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515.   Finally, the town has, in fact, already acted against the Pustells by rejecting their home instruction plan and officially barring them from teaching their daughter at home.  Regardless of the imminence of an enforcement action, the Pustells will continue to suffer the harm of substantial uncertainty if we put off resolving their constitutional claims.  We believe they are entitled to know whether they may continue to school their child at home without risking sanctions.  See Societe de Conditionnement v. Hunter Engineering, 655 F.2d 938, 944 (9th Cir.1981) (actual threat of litigation not necessary for declaratory judgment action to be justiciable);   Wellesley Hills Realty Trust v. Mobil Oil Corp., 747 F.Supp. 93, 102 (D.Mass.1990) (absence of enforcement action does not render controversy between parties remote and hypothetical).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Abstention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\"  Colorado River Water Cons.  Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976);  Villa Marina Yacht Sales v. Hatteras Yachts, 915 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1990).  Nevertheless, certain exceptional circumstances warrant abstention by a federal court from the exercise of its proper jurisdiction.  See Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 813-17, 818-19, 96 S.Ct. at 1244-46, 1246-47 (detailing such circumstances).  Under Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), federal courts may abstain from deciding a case when a state court's resolution of unclear state law would obviate the need for a federal constitutional ruling.  Because the federal court's decision in these circumstances \"cannot escape being a forecast rather than a determination,\" abstention is justified to \"avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.\"  Id. at 499-500, 61 S.Ct. at 645.   In this way, the Pullman abstention doctrine serves the dual aims of avoiding advisory constitutional decisionmaking, as well as promoting the principles of comity and federalism by avoiding needless federal intervention into local affairs.  See 17A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 4242 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Massachusetts compulsory attendance law, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 76, Sec. 1 (West 1982), affords a possible state law basis to vindicate the Pustells' claims.  This law, which requires children to attend public or private school, exempts a child \"who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee.\"   Id.  A homeschooling program is an acceptable alternative to public or private school attendance.

The court observed that requiring periodic standardized testing, or periodic progress reports or dated work samples, in lieu of formal testing, would be acceptable ways to evaluate the educational progress of children being schooled at home.  Id. at 601.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether home visits may be required as part of this evaluation process is unsettled, however.  In Care &amp; Protection of Charles, the court stated that \"[w]ith appropriate testing procedures or progress reports, there may be no need for periodic on-site visits or observations of the learning environment by school authority personnel,\" id.   The court, however, immediately added \"But see Matter of Kilroy.\"   In that case, a New York family court upheld a home visit requirement as necessary to evaluate home instruction to school age children.  121 Misc.2d 98, 467 N.Y.S.2d 318 (1983).  These conflicting references suggest that the court deliberately left unresolved whether home visits could be required under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has yet to be determined, therefore, whether the Lynn School Committee's interpretation of the evaluation component of its regulations, which conditions approval of home instruction on home visits, is authorized by state law.  If, as the Pustells argue, home visits \"are not essential to the State interest in ensuring that 'all the children shall be educated,' \" then the school committee could not condition the approval of the Pustells' home school proposal on an agreement to home visits--even to infrequent and pre-arranged home visits.  Yet the Lynn School Committee's interpretation of the requirements of the Massachusetts compulsory education act is equally plausible, particularly given the reference to Matter of Kilroy in Care &amp; Protection of Charles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispositive state court interpretation of this issue could eliminate entirely the need to address the constitutional issues.  If the Pustells' interpretation of state law were accepted by the state court, the school district would have to allow an alternative to home visits.  This would spare us from rendering an advisory opinion on the constitutional issues.  See Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-501, 61 S.Ct. at 644-645;  see also Catlin v. Ambach, 820 F.2d 588, 591 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision that abstention is appropriate here is affected by another consideration.  Although federal courts are capable of resolving state law issues, educational policy is a matter of particularly local concern.  See Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d at 598 (noting that the details of educational policy adopted by the Massachusetts state legislature historically have been left to the control of the people in each municipality).  The question of what information local school officials need in order to evaluate whether homeschoolers are being educated adequately is best resolved by those closer to the issue than federal court judges.  We therefore think it preferable to allow the Massachusetts courts to complete the analysis begun in Care &amp; Protection of Charles rather than to intervene.  This would allow for the development of an informative record about the efficacy of various assessment practices.  Moreover, any decision by this court about whether Lynn's home visit policy is authorized by state law would be, at best, provisional, as the last word on the legality of Lynn's policy under Massachusetts law lies with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and not with us.  See Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-500, 61 S.Ct. at 644-645.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to create \"needless friction\" with state and local policies, id. at 500, 61 S.Ct. at 645, by preempting the state court's adjudication of the Pustells' claims.

This practice would cede control of litigation to litigants, and interfere with our duty to avoid unnecessary friction with states in the regulation of their own affairs, see Pullman, 312 U.S. at 500, 61 S.Ct. at 645, as well as our duty to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication, see Ashwander v.

The district court upheld the constitutionality of the requirement, and the Pustells now appeal.  Our review of the record and the caselaw persuades us that the district court should have abstained until issues of state law were resolved.  We therefore vacate its judgment, and remand for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Stephen and Lois Pustell are the parents of Geneva Marie Pustell, whom they are educating at home, in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The Pustells live in the Lynn, Massachusetts school district.  Massachusetts state law grants discretion to local school districts to determine the standards for home schooling.  See Care &amp; Protection of Charles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034934\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034934/care-protection-of-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034934\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034934/care-protection-of-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span> (1987).  As a condition of approval of a home instruction plan, the Lynn Public Schools require, among other things, that parents give their signed consent to a home visit by the superintendent or his designee to \"observe and evaluate the instructional process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1991, the Pustells met with Dr. Louis Perullo, the assistant superintendent of the Lynn Public Schools, to discuss their homeschooling plans.  At that meeting, the Pustells objected to the school district's home visit requirement, and offered an alternative consent form eliminating this requirement.  Dr. Perullo rejected the substitution, and told the Pustells that the school district would not approve their home instruction plan absent their written consent to periodic home visits by school officials.  The Pustells refused to offer this consent, and on November 21, 1991 the Lynn school committee voted not to allow the Pustells to educate their daughter at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pustells then brought suit, claiming that the home visit policy violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of their religion, their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches, their substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to oversee the education of their children, and various provisions of the Massachusetts constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant school district, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the panel questioned whether this case was justiciable and, if it were, whether it was appropriate for a federal court to decide the case at this juncture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Pointing to the district court's statement that it was \"unclear whether the Pustells' child is currently being educated at home or in a traditional school setting\" and that \"no criminal or civil proceedings are currently pending against the Pustells based on their refusal to submit to periodic home visits,\" we first expressed concern that this case was unripe, and that we were being asked for an advisory opinion.  We then noted that several factors made abstention a compelling option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After argument, we allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the questions of justiciability and abstention.  We now conclude that there is a justiciable \"case or controversy,\" but that the circumstances of this case make it appropriate for application of the abstention doctrine enunciated in Railroad Commission v.

Justiciability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pustells claim that the case is reviewable because their complaint alleged, and defendants admitted, that their daughter is being taught at home.  Nothing in the record suggests the contrary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  We therefore proceed on the assumption that the Pustells currently are homeschooling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not fully resolve our concerns, however.  For us to assume jurisdiction, there must be an actual, ongoing controversy between the parties.  See U.S. Const. Art.  III, Sec. 2, cl. 1;  Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201 (jurisdiction to award declaratory relief exists only in \"a case of actual controversy\").  Some indication that the controversy has a concrete impact on the parties is also necessary before a case is ripe for adjudication.  Abbott Laboratories v.

The Pustells continue to teach their child at home, despite the school committee's refusal to approve their home instruction plan.  By refusing to comply with the policy, while continuing to homeschool their daughter, the Pustells face possible sanctions.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 76, Sec. 2 (West Supp.1993) (empowering state to initiate truancy proceedings against parents of children absent from school for seven full days);  Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 119, Sec. 24 (West Supp.1993) (empowering any person (including a town) to initiate civil proceedings on behalf of children without \"necessary and proper physical or education care and discipline,\" in order to compel education for such children, and, if appropriate, to remove the children from the custody of their parents);  see also Care &amp; Protection of Charles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034934\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034934/care-protection-of-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034934\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034934/care-protection-of-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span> (1987).  The dispute between the parties is therefore concrete, and not hypothetical or abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No further factual development is necessary for us to resolve the question at issue, namely, whether the policy requiring home visits is constitutional.  The issue is therefore \"fit\" for judicial resolution.  See Abbott Lab., 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515.   Finally, the town has, in fact, already acted against the Pustells by rejecting their home instruction plan and officially barring them from teaching their daughter at home.  Regardless of the imminence of an enforcement action, the Pustells will continue to suffer the harm of substantial uncertainty if we put off resolving their constitutional claims.  We believe they are entitled to know whether they may continue to school their child at home without risking sanctions.  See Societe de Conditionnement v.

In this way, the Pullman abstention doctrine serves the dual aims of avoiding advisory constitutional decisionmaking, as well as promoting the principles of comity and federalism by avoiding needless federal intervention into local affairs.  See 17A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 4242 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Massachusetts compulsory attendance law, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 76, Sec. 1 (West 1982), affords a possible state law basis to vindicate the Pustells' claims.  This law, which requires children to attend public or private school, exempts a child \"who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee.\"   Id.  A homeschooling program is an acceptable alternative to public or private school attendance.  Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d at 598.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to this statutory authority, the Lynn School Committee has adopted regulations governing the approval of home school instruction within its district.  As interpreted by the committee, these regulations include, inter alia, the home visit requirement at issue here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the regulations, the parents must sign a Letter of Agreement giving permission to the superintendent or his designee to \"periodically observe and evaluate the instructional process and to verify that the Home Instruction provided is in accordance with the Home Instruction Plan as authorized by the Committee....\"  The school committee has interpreted the observation and evaluation component to require a pre-arranged home visit once or twice a year for 40-45 minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that \"the approval of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on requirements that are not essential to the State interest in ensuring that 'all the children shall be educated.' \"  Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d at 600.   The court observed that requiring periodic standardized testing, or periodic progress reports or dated work samples, in lieu of formal testing, would be acceptable ways to evaluate the educational progress of children being schooled at home.  Id. at 601.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether home visits may be required as part of this evaluation process is unsettled, however.  In Care &amp; Protection of Charles, the court stated that \"[w]ith appropriate testing procedures or progress reports, there may be no need for periodic on-site visits or observations of the learning environment by school authority personnel,\" id.   The court, however, immediately added \"But see Matter of Kilroy.\"   In that case, a New York family court upheld a home visit requirement as necessary to evaluate home instruction to school age children.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Misc. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></span> (1983).  These conflicting references suggest that the court deliberately left unresolved whether home visits could be required under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has yet to be determined, therefore, whether the Lynn School Committee's interpretation of the evaluation component of its regulations, which conditions approval of home instruction on home visits, is authorized by state law.  If, as the Pustells argue, home visits \"are not essential to the State interest in ensuring that 'all the children shall be educated,' \" then the school committee could not condition the approval of the Pustells' home school proposal on an agreement to home visits--even to infrequent and pre-arranged home visits.  Yet the Lynn School Committee's interpretation of the requirements of the Massachusetts compulsory education act is equally plausible, particularly given the reference to Matter of Kilroy in Care &amp; Protection of Charles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispositive state court interpretation of this issue could eliminate entirely the need to address the constitutional issues.  If the Pustells' interpretation of state law were accepted by the state court, the school district would have to allow an alternative to home visits.  This would spare us from rendering an advisory opinion on the constitutional issues.  See Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-501, 61 S.Ct. at 644-645;  see also Catlin v. Ambach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489508\"><a href=\"/opinion/489508/daniel-catlin-and-dundeen-catlin-individually-and-as-parents-and-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 591 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision that abstention is appropriate here is affected by another consideration.  Although federal courts are capable of resolving state law issues, educational policy is a matter of particularly local concern.  See Care &amp; Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d at 598 (noting that the details of educational policy adopted by the Massachusetts state legislature historically have been left to the control of the people in each municipality).  The question of what information local school officials need in order to evaluate whether homeschoolers are being educated adequately is best resolved by those closer to the issue than federal court judges.  We therefore think it preferable to allow the Massachusetts courts to complete the analysis begun in Care &amp; Protection of Charles rather than to intervene.  This would allow for the development of an informative record about the efficacy of various assessment practices.  Moreover, any decision by this court about whether Lynn's home visit policy is authorized by state law would be, at best, provisional, as the last word on the legality of Lynn's policy under Massachusetts law lies with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and not with us.  See Pullman, 312 U.S. at 499-500, 61 S.Ct. at 644-645.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to create \"needless friction\" with state and local policies, id. at 500, 61 S.Ct. at 645, by preempting the state court's adjudication of the Pustells' claims.  Accordingly, the district court should abstain, but retain jurisdiction pending a decision by the Massachusetts state court on the proper interpretation of the compulsory education law.

The \"fitness\" inquiry asks whether the challenged action is final, and whether the issue presented is purely legal, rather than in need of more concrete factual development.  Id.

This practice would cede control of litigation to litigants, and interfere with our duty to avoid unnecessary friction with states in the regulation of their own affairs, see Pullman, 312 U.S. at 500, 61 S.Ct. at 645, as well as our duty to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication, see Ashwander v.
