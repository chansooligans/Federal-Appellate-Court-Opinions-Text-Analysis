This  case  presents  the\n                                   \n\nquestion of whether a town's disparate harbor usage  fees between\n\nresidents and  nonresidents violates the Fourteenth  Amendment of\n\nthe Constitution.   Plaintiffs-appellants, LCM  Enterprises, Inc.\n\n(\"LCM\") and Robert  Capobianco,1 brought this action  against the\n\ntown of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, its Board of Selectmen, and its\n\nWaterways  Advisory Committee in the United States District Court\n\nfor  the District  of Massachusetts.    Appellants challenge  the\n\nconstitutionality of Dartmouth's usage fees which are assessed on\n\nboats that the  appellants keep moored in the town's  harbor.  As\n\nnonresidents, appellants  must pay  a higher  fee than  residents\n\nwith similarly sized boats.  Although the Constitution does place\n\nlimits on a  town's ability to tax users  of America's waterways,\n\nwe find that the actions taken  by Dartmouth in this case do  not\n\nimplicate  such  limits.   We  consequently  affirm  the district\n\ncourt's  order  granting   summary  judgment  in  favor   of  the\n\ndefendants-appellees.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n          On   May  7,  1991,   the  municipality  of  Dartmouth,\n\nMassachusetts established a Waterways Management Enterprise  Fund\n\n(the \"waterways  fund\"  or  \"fund\"),  pursuant  to  Massachusetts\n\nGeneral  Laws, Chapter  44, Section  53F1/2  (1990),2 to  support\n\n                    \n\n1   Capobianco is the  president and  treasurer of LCM  which was\ncreated to hold ownership of one of Capobianco's boats.\n\n2  Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 44,    53F1/2 (1990)  authorizes a town  to\nestablish  an  \"enterprise  fund\" for  a  \"utility,  health care,\nrecreational or transportation facility, and its operation.\"\n\n                               -2-\n\nwater  related  infrastructure.    The  fund  is  financed  by  a\n\nwaterways use  fee (the \"use  fee\") which  is levied by  the town\n\nupon all boat owners who use the waterways of Dartmouth  for more\n\nthan  limited  periods of  time.    The  amount  of  the  fee  is\n\ndetermined in accordance with the following use fee schedule:\n\n          (1)  For residents of Dartmouth:\n\n            (a)  $20 for boats 12 to 16 feet in      \n                 length;\n            (b)  $35 for boats 17 to 30 feet in      \n                 length;\n            (c)  $35  for the first  30 feet plus  $1\n            per      each additional foot for boats  \n                     greater than 30 feet in length.\n\n          (2)  For nonresidents of Dartmouth:\n\n            (a)  $50 for boats 12 to 16 feet in      \n                 length;\n            (b)  $100 for boats 17 to 30 feet in     \n                 length;\n            (c)   $100  for the  first  30 feet  plus\n            $1.50       per each  additional foot for\n            boats            greater than 30  feet in\n            length.\n\nA resident is defined as one or more of the following:\n\n          A voter registered in the Town.\n          A person who is domiciled in the Town.\n          A person who pays real estate taxes to the Town.\n          A spouse or dependant of any of the above.\n\nDartmouth, Mass., Amendment to Dartmouth General By-Laws  Article\nIV, Section 19B, Sub-Section 25 (May 7, 1991).\n\n          Appellants are both nonresidents of Dartmouth according\n\nto  the town's  definition of  residency.   Appellant LCM  owns a\n\nfifty  foot boat  and appellant  Capobianco owns  a fifteen  foot\n\nboat.  Both  boats are habitually moored or  docked in Dartmouth.\n\nLCM  and   Capobianco  must  pay   use  fees  of  $130   and  $50\n\nrespectively.  Residents with similar  sized boats would have  to\n\n                               -3-\n\npay fees of $55 and $20 respectively.\n\n          Appellants also pay an excise tax to Dartmouth pursuant\n\nto  Massachusetts General Laws Chapter  60B \"for the privilege of\n\nusing  the  waterways of  the  Commonwealth  [of Massachusetts].\"\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 60B,   2(a).  The Commonwealth imposes the tax\n\nbut directs cities  and towns to collect  the tax and use  it for\n\nwaterway maintenance.    All  boat  owners  pay  the  excise  tax\n\naccording  to  the same  formula  regardless  of their  place  of\n\nresidence.    In addition,  the  appellants claim  that  they pay\n\n$2,450 in slip  rental fees to the New Bedford  Yacht Club which,\n\nthey point out, pays real estate taxes to Dartmouth.\n\n          Dartmouth  places  the  money  it  collects   from  the\n\ndisputed use  fee,  along with  other revenues  from boating  and\n\nshellfish licenses and permits, in the waterways fund.  Dartmouth\n\nalso deposits 50% of the Massachusetts excise taxes on boats that\n\nit collects  into the  fund.   The other  50% of  the excise  tax\n\nrevenue is  placed into  the town's general  fund.   According to\n\naffidavits  provided  by town  officials,  Dartmouth  collected a\n\ntotal of $118,042  in revenues for the waterways  fund for fiscal\n\nyear 1992 including  $58,874 in Usage Fees and  $28,122 in excise\n\ntaxes.3\n\n                    \n\n3  The set of figures  used in this opinion are \"actual\"  figures\naccording to  Dartmouth's affidavits.   The  town also  submitted\n\"budgeted\" or \"estimated\"  figures that differ slightly,  but not\nsignificantly,  from  the  \"actual\"  ones.    We  use the  actual\nfigures, as  did the  district court, because  they provide  more\ncomplete  information.  The use  of the estimated figures instead\nof the actual  ones, however, would have no  effect whatsoever on\nour analysis or our decision.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The  same  Dartmouth  affidavits reveal  that  the town\n\nspent $111,276 in fiscal year  1992 on port related services such\n\nas  waterway  maintenance,  capital  improvements  and  operating\n\nexpenses   plus   an  additional   $17,217  for   overhead  costs\n\nattributable to  town  administration expenses.   These  expenses\n\nwere paid for entirely out of the waterways fund and consumed all\n\nfund revenues for fiscal year 1992.  According to town officials,\n\nthe town also spent $127,888.23 on municipal services provided to\n\nthe waterfront and harbor including police, fire, sanitation, and\n\nother such services.   Dartmouth paid for these costs  out of its\n\ngeneral fund which depends on the town's general tax levy, namely\n\nreal  estate taxes  and fire  district taxes,  for  its revenues.\n\nDartmouth also presented evidence showing that its harbor related\n\nexpenses were increasing significantly every year.\n\n          In  November  of  1991, appellants  filed  suit against\n\nDartmouth  contending that the facial disparity in the assessment\n\nand  collection   of  the   use  fee   constituted  impermissible\n\ndiscrimination under the  Commerce Clause,  the Equal  Protection\n\nClause and  the Due Process  Clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment and, initially, both agreed\n\nthat  no genuine  issues of  material fact  existed in  the case.\n\nAfter a hearing on the  motions, however, appellants submitted  a\n\nsupplemental  memorandum in  which they  challenged  some of  the\n\nfactual assertions contained in the appellees' affidavits.\n\n          The  district  court then  granted summary  judgment in\n\nfavor of Dartmouth and the other appellees.  The court found that\n\n                               -5-\n\nappellants lacked standing  to raise a Commerce  Clause challenge\n\nbecause they used their boats only for recreational  purposes and\n\ndid not engage in any  commercial activity that would be affected\n\nby the use  fee.  In ruling  on the Fourteenth  Amendment claims,\n\nthe district  court found that Dartmouth's actions did not burden\n\na  fundamental   right  nor  invoke   a  suspect  classification;\n\nconsequently, the fee scheme need only be rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate purpose in order to pass Constitutional scrutiny.  The\n\ndistrict  court   granted  summary  judgment  because   it  found\n\nDartmouth's  fee   structure  was   rationally  related   to  the\n\nlegitimate  goal of equitably  distributing the growing  costs of\n\nwaterway maintenance between residents and nonresidents.   Noting\n\nthat Dartmouth  had to use money  from its general fund  to cover\n\nthe shortfall  between total costs attributable to the harbor and\n\ntotal revenues from the waterways fund,  the district court found\n\nthat  the disparate fee  structure was rationally  related to the\n\ngoal of  equalizing the burdens  between residents, who  pay real\n\nestate  and  fire  district  taxes  to  the  general  fund,   and\n\nnonresidents, who contribute little to the general fund.\n\n          On appeal,  appellants challenge  the Equal  Protection\n\nand Due Process rulings and the trial court's implicit conclusion\n\nthat there  are no  disputed issues of  material fact  to justify\n\nsummary judgment.   Appellants also raise related claims based on\n\nthe theory that Dartmouth's fee is an impermissible regulation of\n\nthe  waterways.   After reviewing  the record  in the  light most\n\nfavorable to the  appellants for any genuine issue  of a material\n\n                               -6-\n\nfact that would preclude summary judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\n\nRogers v. Fair, 902 F.2d 140,  143 (1st Cir. 1990), we find  that\n              \n\nthe district court was correct  in holding that Dartmouth and the\n\nother appellees were entitled to a  judgment in their favor as  a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n              II.  EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS\n                   EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS\n\n          When a  state,  or  a  political  subdivision  thereof,\n\ndistinguishes  between   two  similarly   situated  groups,   the\n\ndistinctions  it makes  are subject to  scrutiny under  the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.  Such scrutiny is\n\nnormally of  the rational  basis variety  unless the  distinction\n\ninvolves a suspect classification or burdens a fundamental right.\n\nNordlinger v. Hahn, 112 S.  Ct. 2326, 2331-32 (1992); Friedman v.\n                                                              \n\nRogers, 440 U.S.  1, 17 (1979)  (citing New Orleans v.  Dukes 427\n                                                             \n\nU.S. 297, 303 (1976)); Campos v.  I.N.S., 961 F.2d 309, 316  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992).\n\n          In  judging the  constitutionality  of Dartmouth's  use\n\nfee, the district  court applied the  rational basis standard  of\n\nscrutiny because the  fee did not penalize the  right to travel,4\n\nor any other fundamental  right, and it did not  invoke a suspect\n\nclassification.   See  Hawaii  Boating  Ass'n  v.  Water  Transp.\n                                                                 \n\nFacilities Div., Dept. of Transp., 651 F.2d 661, 664-66 (9th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1981).   For the same  reasons, the district  court appropriately\n\n                    \n\n4   The fundamental right to travel is  not burdened in this case\nbecause  boaters who pass through the town or moor their boats in\nthe harbor for  only short periods of time are not subject to the\nuse fee.\n\n                               -7-\n\napplied   the  rational  basis   level  of  scrutiny   to  assess\n\nappellants' Due Process claim as well.  See Baker v. Concord, 916\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 744, 755  (1st Cir. 1990); In  Re Wood, 866 F.2d  1367, 1371\n                                           \n\n(11th Cir. 1989).   On appeal, appellants  fail to point  out any\n\nerror in the judge's finding that no fundamental right or suspect\n\nclassification is implicated  in this case.  Thus,  to the extent\n\nthey challenge the  level of scrutiny applied to  Dartmouth's use\n\nfee,5 we invoke \"the settled  appellate rule that issues adverted\n\nto  in  a perfunctory  manner,  unaccompanied by  some  effort at\n\ndeveloped  argumentation, are deemed  waived.\"  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nInnamorati, 996  F.2d 456, 468  (1st Cir.  1993) (quoting  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d  1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 494\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1082 (1990)).\n\n          Under rational  basis scrutiny,  a classification  will\n\nwithstand a constitutional challenge as long  as it is rationally\n\nrelated  to a legitimate state interest and is neither arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable nor irrational.

Rogers, 440 U.S. at 17.\n                               \n\n          Dartmouth argued, and  the district  court found,  that\n\nthe disparate structure  of the use fee is  rationally related to\n\nthe goal of  \"fairly distributing harbor costs to  all users\" and\n\nthus  equalizing the  otherwise disproportionate  burdens between\n\nresidents and nonresidents of maintaining the harbor.  Appellants\n\nclaim  that no  such  disproportionate  burdens  are  imposed  on\n\nresidents and that  nonresidents do pay an equal  share of harbor\n\ncosts absent  the disparate usage  fees.6  Appellants  attempt to\n\ndistinguish the instant case from two cases that upheld disparate\n\nusage  fees between residents  and nonresidents, Baldwin  v. Fish\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n6  Appellants  briefly raise an additional argument  that the use\nfee  is really  an  excise  tax which,  they  claim, renders  the\ndiscriminatory  structure of  the  fee  violative  of  the  Equal\nProtection Clause.  Appellants cite Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.\n                                                              \nWard,  470 U.S.  869 (1985),  for the proposition  that disparate\n    \nexcise  taxes  between  residents  and  nonresidents violate  the\nConstitution.\n\n   Without  delving into  the issue  of  whether the  use fee  is\nreally a fee or a tax, it is sufficient  for our purposes to note\nthat Metropolitan  Life held that  using a discriminatory  tax to\n                       \nencourage the formation of domestic  companies at the expense  of\nforeign companies was  not a legitimate  purpose under the  Equal\nProtection Clause.  Id. at  876-83.  That holding does  not apply\n                      \nto  the  present  case  because,  unlike  the  tax  at  issue  in\nMetropolitan Life, the aim of  Dartmouth's use fee is to equalize\n                 \ndisproportionate  burdens, not to favor locals  at the expense of\nnonresidents.   It is also significant that Dartmouth applies all\nof the  revenues it receives  from the usage fee  for nonresident\nboaters to the maintenance of waterways utilized by those boaters\nand not to Dartmouth's general fund.\n\n                               -9-\n\nand  Game  Comm'n,  436  U.S. 371,  388-91  (1978),7  and  Hawaii\n                                                                 \n\nBoating, 651 F.2d  at 666,8 on the grounds  that the nonresidents\n       \n\nin those cases did not  contribute financially to the state other\n\nthan through the challenged fees.  In this case, appellants argue\n\nthat  nonresidents,  such  as themselves,  do  contribute  to the\n\ntown's general fund by paying the state excise tax on boats  (50%\n\nof  which goes  to the  Dartmouth's general  fund) and  by paying\n\n$2,450 in slip  rental fees to a yacht club that pays real estate\n\ntaxes.   They  conclude that,  because  resident and  nonresident\n\nboaters  shoulder  all  the costs  equally,  Dartmouth  is really\n\nseeking to  impose greater burdens  on nonresidents  in order  to\n\nlessen the burdens  on residents, a policy that purportedly bears\n\nno rational relationship to any legitimate state interest.\n\n          Appellants'  challenge of the use fee essentially boils\n\ndown to an attack on the reasonableness of Dartmouth's assessment\n\nof its own  harbor related revenues and  expenses.  As a  result,\n\nthey  undertake  the very  difficult  burden  of showing  that  a\n\ngovernment's  financial  planning,  calculation  and analysis  is\n\n                    \n\n7  The  Supreme Court in  Baldwin upheld a  Montana statute  that\n                                 \nimposed  on nonresidents  much higher  fees  for certain  hunting\nlicenses  than it imposed  on residents because  the \"legislative\nchoice  was an  economic means  not unreasonably  related  to the\npreservation  of a finite  resource and a  substantial regulatory\ninterest of the State.\"  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390. \n                                \n\n8   In Hawaii Boating, the  Ninth Circuit upheld  a state statute\n                     \nthat  assessed  higher  moorage  fees  to  nonresidents  than  to\nresidents  because the disparate rates were rationally related to\nthe  \"valid legislative goal\"  of \"equalizing costs  attendant to\nmaintaining and constructing small boat harbors . . . .\"   Hawaii\n                                                                 \nBoating, 651 F.2d at 666.

Ct. at  2332 (noting that states  have \"large\n          \n\nleeway\" in creating distinctions in their tax laws); Baldwin, 436\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  390-91 (finding no  need for state to  precisely justify\n\nthe cost  differential between  hunting license  fees charged  to\n\nresidents and nonresidents);  Baker, 916 F.2d at  747-48 (finding\n                                   \n\nthe  use of classifications  that lack \"mathematical  nicety\" and\n\ncontain other imperfections does not violate the Equal Protection\n\nClause).   Appellants  cannot sustain this  burden if  the record\n\nevidences  any reasonable  basis for  Dartmouth  to believe  that\n\nthere  was  a   disparity  in  waterways  contributions   between\n\nresidents and nonresidents.9\n\n          The  record clearly  shows that  such  a basis  exists.\n\nDartmouth  spends  all  of the  money  from  its  waterways fund,\n\nconsisting of $118,042 in resident and nonresident contributions,\n\non  waterways related  expenses.   The  town must  then spend  an\n\nadditional  $127,888.23 for  municipal services  provided to  the\n\nharbor.10     Unlike  the   waterways  fund,  this   money  comes\n\n                    \n\n9   The  Fourteenth  Amendment  also  requires  that  Dartmouth's\ndisparate fee  structure not be  unreasonably disproportionate to\nthe size of the disparity it purports to correct.  This  issue is\nnot before us, however, because  appellants have not raised it on\nappeal.  Furthermore, the additional fees charged to nonresidents\ndo not exceed the $127,888.23 shortfall which  the residents must\nmake up.\n\n10    The appellants  argue  that  the  district court  erred  in\ngranting summary  judgment because  a genuine  issue of  material\nfact  existed with regard to the  alleged \"shortfall\" between the\nrevenues collected from waterways related levies and the expenses\nattributable to the waterways.  In its supplemental memorandum to\nthe  district court, appellants  disputed the  $127,888.23 figure\nprovided by  the  town because  it included  several items  that,\n\n                               -11-\n\nprimarily  from residents through  real estate and  fire district\n\ntaxes.  There is thus  a disproportionate burden on residents for\n\nharbor  expenses even  after  the  disparate  fees  are  imposed.\n                                                                \n\nClearly,  Dartmouth's attempt to  make up some  of this disparity\n\nthrough a disparate fee structure passes constitutional muster.  \n\n          Appellants argue  that they contribute  equally to  the\n\ntown's general fund even  though they do not  pay real estate  or\n\nfire  district taxes.11   They  point first  to their  payment of\n\n                    \n\nallegedly,  do not  belong on  the  list.   The challenged  items\ninclude the  cost of  grading the  town landing  ($1,065.19), the\ncost   of  certain  police  services  ($24,451.00),  and  several\nunspecified expenses  involving  town  services  that  supposedly\nreceive state or federal funding.  Appellants' objections  do not\nraise any disputed  issue of material fact because the objections\ndo not deny that some shortfall  exists.  Were the court to  take\nall of appellants' objections as true, Dartmouth would still have\na $100,000 shortfall minus some unspecified fraction of state and\nfederal funding.   As long as some  shortfall exists, and as long\nas that shortfall is made up by Dartmouth's general tax levy, the\nprecise  size  of that  shortfall is  irrelevant for  purposes of\njudging  the  rationality  of  the   use  fee  at  issue.    More\nimportantly, none  of appellants'  objections to  the $127,888.23\nfigure raises an  issue as to whether Dartmouth's perception that\nresidents  were paying a  disproportionate share of  harbor costs\nwas unreasonable or irrational.\n\n   Because appellants raised  no genuine issue of  material fact,\nthe district  court was  not, as  appellants claim,  obligated to\nallow  them to present conflicting testimony and other additional\nevidence  or   to  cross-examine  Dartmouth's   witnesses  before\ngranting summary judgment.\n\n   To the extent appellants attack the overall credibility of the\naffiants and the veracity of  the information contained in  their\naffidavits, such objections were never raised before the district\ncourt and thus are waived on appeal.  Atlas v. Eastern Air Lines,\n                                                                 \nInc.,  311 F.2d 156, 162 (1st Cir.  1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S.\n                                                       \n904 (1963).\n\n11   Appellants  also claim  that  Dartmouth failed  to show  any\nrelation  between  its  shortfall and  nonresidents'  use  of the\nharbor.    As the  district  court  correctly pointed  out,  \"the\nrelevant question  is  not really  whether the  costs of  certain\n\n                               -12-\n\nthe Massachusetts  boat excise  tax, half  of which  is deposited\n\ninto Dartmouth's  general fund.   Aside from  the fact  that both\n\nresidents  and   nonresident  boaters   pay  this   tax  equally,\n\nappellants' argument fails  because the revenues from  the excise\n\ntax do not  even come close to  covering the shortfall in  harbor\n\ncosts which residents must pay for.  Only $28,122 was placed into\n\nthe  town's  general fund  from the  excise  taxes.   Even  if we\n\nincorrectly   attribute  this   entire   amount  to   nonresident\n\ncontributors,  we still  have  a  shortfall  for  harbor  related\n\nexpenses of  $99,766.23 ($127,888.23 in municipal  services minus\n\n$28,122.00 in  excise tax revenues  going to  the general  fund).\n\nThus, with the excise taxes included in the calculus, there still\n\nremains  a sizeable  pool of  funds used  for harbor  services to\n\nwhich residents disproportionately contribute.12\n\n          Nevertheless, appellants  argue that  their payment  of\n\nslip  rental   fees  compensates   for  any   inequality  between\n\n                    \n\nwaterfront  services are attributable to nonresidents' use of the\n                                     \nharbor,  but  instead whether  nonresidents  avail  themselves of\n                                                  \nthose services and can thus fairly be required to pay their share\nof the costs.\"   Appellants' argument is irrelevant  to the issue\nof  whether nonresidents are  contributing equally to  the entire\npool of  funds used  for waterway maintenance.   The  presence of\nsuch an  inequality is all  that is required to  find Dartmouth's\nuse fee rationally related to a legitimate legislative goal.\n\n12    We  do  not  consider the  further  and  very  questionable\nproposition that  if the amounts  from the excise tax  closed the\ngap  between harbor related expenses and harbor related revenues,\nDartmouth  would, on  that basis  alone,  violate the  Fourteenth\nAmendment by imposing the disparate use fee.  Other factors, such\nas the need to address the problem of  rising waterfront costs or\nsimply  the vagaries of the legislative process, militate against\nthe conclusion that  Dartmouth would be acting irrationally if it\nfailed to  consider the excise  tax revenues when  it established\nthe use fee.\n\n                               -13-\n\nthemselves and other residents because those fees are paid to the\n\nNew Bedford Yacht Club which itself, allegedly, pays  real estate\n\ntaxes to Dartmouth's general fund.  Appellants made this argument\n\nto the  district  court during  the  hearing and  in  appellants'\n\nsupplemental memorandum.13   We  question whether  the manner  in\n\nwhich  appellants raised  the issue  was  sufficient to  properly\n\nplace  it before  the district  court as  the record  contains no\n\naffidavit  or  other  evidentiary  foundation,  beyond  the  mere\n\nstatements by  appellants' counsel,  concerning the  alleged fact\n\nthat appellants paid slip rental fees.\n\n          In any event, the fact that appellants pay  slip rental\n\nfees  does not  present any question  of material fact  as to the\n\nrationality of Dartmouth's use fee schedule.  First of all, there\n\nis nothing in the record indicating how much, if any, real estate\n\ntaxes are paid by the Yacht Club  and what percentage, if any, of\n\nthose taxes  are attributable  to slip fees  paid by  appellants.\n\nAppellants'   argument  is  thus   a  mere  assertion   which  is\n\ninsufficient to raise a  triable issue.  Rogers v. Fair, 902 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n140, 143 (1st Cir. 1990)  (finding that the nonmovant must adduce\n\nspecific,  provable facts to  defeat an otherwise  proper summary\n\njudgment motion).\n\n          Even if  we assume  that some amount  of the  slip fees\n\npaid  by appellants  are passed  on to Dartmouth's  general fund,\n\nhowever, the town could still reasonably  conclude that the level\n\n                    \n\n13  The district court briefly alluded to the slip rental fees in\na footnote to its decision.\n\n                               -14-\n\nof nonresident  contributions is less  than the total  tax burden\n\nimposed  on residents.    Not all  nonresident  boaters pay  slip\n\nrental fees; many  simply moor their boats in  the harbor without\n\nrenting  space from a  Yacht Club or  other private organization.\n\nIn the case of  nonresident boaters who do pay slip  rental fees,\n\none might reasonably conclude that yacht clubs are unable to pass\n\non  to their  boating  customers  the entire  pro  rata share  of\n\nmunicipal  taxes   attributable  to   boaters  who  rent   slips.\n\nDartmouth could  reasonably conclude  that, for  various economic\n\nreasons,  businesses can  increase  their  prices  by  only  some\n\nfraction  of the  tax imposed  on them.   Under  this assumption,\n\nboaters renting slips  would pay a proportionately  smaller share\n\nof real estate taxes than residents.\n\n          Consequently,    Dartmouth's    general    rule    that\n\ndistinguishes  between  residents,  who  directly  pay  municipal\n\ntaxes, and nonresidents, who contribute indirectly or not at all,\n\nis rationally related  to the disproportionate burdens  placed on\n\nharbor users, even though this rule may overlook some  variations\n\nin the contributions made by individual nonresident boaters.  See\n                                                                 \n\nBaldwin, 436 U.S.  at 391 (\"We perceive  no duty on the  State to\n       \n\nhave  its  licensing  structure parallel  or  identical  for both\n\nresidents and nonresidents,  or to justify to the  penny any cost\n\ndifferential it imposes in  a purely recreational, noncommercial,\n\nnonlivelihood setting.\");  Dandridge v.

In this\n                            \n\ncase, we fail to see  how Dartmouth's alleged failure to consider\n\nthe payment  of slip  rental fees when  implementing its  use fee\n\ncould   constitute   an    unreasonableness   of   constitutional\n\nproportions.\n\n          Appellants finally contend that  their payment of  slip\n\nrental fees puts them in substantially the same position as other\n\nparties that  qualify as  \"residents\" under  Dartmouth's use  fee\n\nordinance.  \"Residents\"  include registered  voters of  Dartmouth\n\nand  persons  domiciled  in  Dartmouth.     Both  classifications\n\nencompass persons, such as renters and those  living with friends\n\nor relatives, who, like appellants and other nonresidents, either\n\ndo  not pay any real  estate taxes to the town  or only pay taxes\n\nindirectly  through rental  payments.   The residency  definition\n\nalso includes, as a separate category, persons paying real estate\n\ntaxes  to  Dartmouth;  this  implies  that  the  other  residency\n\ncategories  refer to nontaxpayers.  Appellants argue that because\n\nthe use  fee definition of  a resident includes  many \"residents\"\n\nwho make  the same  contribution to  Dartmouth's general fund  as\n\nnonresidents make, the fee structure is not rationally related to\n\nthe goal of equalizing the burdens of harbor maintenance.\n\n          Dartmouth responds, reasonably we  think, that it tried\n\nto make its residency definition  as liberal as possible while at\n\nthe  same  time imposing  a  larger  fee on  people  who use  its\n\n                               -16-\n\nwaterways  exclusively without  contributing much  to  the town's\n\ngeneral fund.  In broadening the residency definition  to include\n\npersons  other  than  local taxpayers,  the  town  may reasonably\n\nconclude that renters and voters make other  contributions to the\n\ntown --  by, for example,  participating in local  community life\n\nand in the local economy -- that nonresident boaters do not make.\n\nCf. Nordlinger,  112 S. Ct.  at 2335 (\"For purposes  of rational-\n              \n\nbasis review, the 'latitude of discretion is notably  wide in . .\n\n. the granting of partial  or total [tax] exemptions upon grounds\n\nof policy.'\")  (quoting F.S.

In the context of a broader fee schedule\n\nthat  generally distinguishes between persons who are more likely\n\nto pay  property taxes  and persons  who are  less likely  to pay\n\nproperty taxes, Dartmouth's decision  to treat renters of a  boat\n\nslip differently from renters  of a dwelling does  not constitute\n\nimpermissible discrimination.  \n\n          It  is well  established  that a  statute  need not  be\n\nprecisely tailored to  fit its legislative goal in  order to meet\n\nthe rational relationship test.

IMPERMISSIBLE REGULATION OF THE WATERWAYS\n               IMPERMISSIBLE REGULATION OF THE WATERWAYS\n\n          Appellants contend that  Dartmouth's discriminatory use\n\nfee  constitutes an  impermissible  regulation  of  the  nation's\n\nwaterways.   In addition, they argue that  Dartmouth's actions in\n\nthis  case are  preempted by  extensive  federal legislation  and\n\nregulation in  this area.   In conclusion, appellants  state that\n\n\"Dartmouth's actions  in assessing  the use  fees is,  therefore,\n\nviolative of the  commerce clause in that it (1)  is preempted by\n                                 \n\nfederal legislation  and (2)  it unreasonably  impairs access  to\n\nnavigable waters\" (emphasis added).\n\n          To  the  extent  appellants'  impermissible  regulation\n\nclaims depend on the Commerce  Clause of the Constitution, as the\n\nabove language  suggests, we are  unable to consider them  in our\n\nreview  of the  summary judgment  decision.   The district  court\n\nfound that appellants lacked standing  to raise a claim under the\n\nCommerce  Clause and appellants do  not challenge this finding on\n\nappeal.14  Even  if these claims are independent  of the Commerce\n\nClause,   however,  they  lack  sufficient  merit  to  require  a\n\nreversal.\n\n                    \n\n14  Appellants,  in fact, conceded that they  lack standing under\nthe Commerce Clause at oral argument.\n\n                               -18-\n\n          Appellants  are  correct   in  their  observation  that\n\nnavigable waters  of the United  States are  public property  and\n\ncannot  be obstructed  or impeded so  as to  impair the  right to\n\ntheir navigation.

Clyde  Mallory Lines  v.  Alabama, 296  U.S. 261,  267\n                                            \n\n(1935).   In the  present case, appellants fail  to point out how\n\nDartmouth's  disparate  usage  fee impairs  access  to  navigable\n\nwaters in any  way, unreasonably or otherwise.   Boaters can pass\n\nthrough Dartmouth  and even  stay in Dartmouth  for a  few nights\n\nwithout being required to pay any usage fee at all.  Furthermore,\n\nthe use fee, as discussed  above, provides a reasonable method of\n\ndefraying the costs of waterways maintenance.\n\n          Appellants also provide no support for their claim that\n\nfederal  law   preempts  Dartmouth's   use  fee.     \"[W]here   a\n\ncongressional statute does  not expressly declare that  state law\n\nis  to be  pre-empted,  and  where there  is  no actual  conflict\n\nbetween what  federal law and  state law prescribe,  [the Supreme\n\nCourt has]  required that there  be evidence  of a  congressional\n\nintent to pre-empt the specific  field covered by the state law.\"\n\nWardair Canada  Inc. v.

Appellants challenge the constitutionality of Dartmouth's usage fees which are assessed on boats that the appellants keep moored in the town's harbor.  As nonresidents, appellants must pay a higher fee than residents with similarly sized boats.  Although the Constitution does place limits on a town's ability to tax users of America's waterways, we find that the actions taken by Dartmouth in this case do not implicate such limits.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 7, 1991, the municipality of Dartmouth, Massachusetts established a Waterways Management Enterprise Fund (the \"waterways fund\" or \"fund\"), pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 53F 1/2 (1990),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to support water related infrastructure.  The fund is financed by a waterways use fee (the \"use fee\") which is levied by the town upon all boat owners who use the waterways of Dartmouth for more than limited periods of time.  The amount of the fee is determined in accordance with the following use fee schedule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>(1) For residents of Dartmouth:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) $20 for boats 12 to 16 feet in length;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) $35 for boats 17 to 30 feet in length;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) $35 for the first 30 feet plus $1 per each additional foot for boats greater than 30 feet in length.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(2) For nonresidents of Dartmouth:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) $50 for boats 12 to 16 feet in length;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) $100 for boats 17 to 30 feet in length;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) $100 for the first 30 feet plus $1.50 per each additional foot for boats greater than 30 feet in length.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A resident is defined as one or more of the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A voter registered in the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>A person who is domiciled in the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A person who pays real estate taxes to the Town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A spouse or dependant of any of the above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth, Mass., Amendment to Dartmouth General By-Laws Article IV, Section 19B, Sub-Section 25 (May 7, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are both nonresidents of Dartmouth according to the town's definition of residency.  Appellant LCM owns a fifty foot boat and appellant Capobianco owns a fifteen foot boat.  Both boats are habitually moored or docked in Dartmouth.  LCM and Capobianco must pay use fees of $130 and $50 respectively.  Residents with similar sized boats would have to pay fees of $55 and $20 respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also pay an excise tax to Dartmouth pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 60B \"for the privilege of using the waterways of the Commonwealth [of Massachusetts].\"  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 60B, Sec. 2(a).  The Commonwealth imposes the tax but directs cities and towns to collect the tax and use it for waterway maintenance.  All boat owners pay the excise tax according to the same formula regardless of their place of residence.  In addition, the appellants claim that they pay $2,450 in slip rental fees to the New Bedford Yacht Club which, they point out, pays real estate taxes to Dartmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth places the money it collects from the disputed use fee, along with other revenues from boating and shellfish licenses and permits, in the waterways fund.  Dartmouth also deposits 50% of the Massachusetts excise taxes on boats that it collects into the fund.  The other 50% of the excise tax revenue is placed into the town's general fund.  According to affidavits provided by town officials, Dartmouth collected a total of $118,042 in revenues for the waterways fund for fiscal year 1992 including $58,874 in Usage Fees and $28,122 in excise taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same Dartmouth affidavits reveal that the town spent $111,276 in fiscal year 1992 on port related services such as waterway maintenance, capital improvements and operating expenses plus an additional $17,217 for overhead costs attributable to town administration expenses.  These expenses were paid for entirely out of the waterways fund and consumed all fund revenues for fiscal year 1992.  According to town officials, the town also spent $127,888.23 on municipal services provided to the waterfront and harbor including police, fire, sanitation, and other such services.  Dartmouth paid for these costs out of its general fund which depends on the town's general tax levy, namely real estate taxes and fire district taxes, for its revenues.  Dartmouth also presented evidence showing that its harbor related expenses were increasing significantly every year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1991, appellants filed suit against Dartmouth contending that the facial disparity in the assessment and collection of the use fee constituted impermissible discrimination under the Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Both sides moved for summary judgment and, initially, both agreed that no genuine issues of material fact existed in the case.  After a hearing on the motions, however, appellants submitted a supplemental memorandum in which they challenged some of the factual assertions contained in the appellees' affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then granted summary judgment in favor of Dartmouth and the other appellees.  The court found that appellants lacked standing to raise a Commerce Clause challenge because they used their boats only for recreational purposes and did not engage in any commercial activity that would be affected by the use fee.  In ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment claims, the district court found that Dartmouth's actions did not burden a fundamental right nor invoke a suspect classification;  consequently, the fee scheme need only be rationally related to a legitimate purpose in order to pass Constitutional scrutiny.  The district court granted summary judgment because it found Dartmouth's fee structure was rationally related to the legitimate goal of equitably distributing the growing costs of waterway maintenance between residents and nonresidents.  Noting that Dartmouth had to use money from its general fund to cover the shortfall between total costs attributable to the harbor and total revenues from the waterways fund, the district court found that the disparate fee structure was rationally related to the goal of equalizing the burdens between residents, who pay real estate and fire district taxes to the general fund, and nonresidents, who contribute little to the general fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellants challenge the Equal Protection and Due Process rulings and the trial court's implicit conclusion that there are no disputed issues of material fact to justify summary judgment.  Appellants also raise related claims based on the theory that Dartmouth's fee is an impermissible regulation of the waterways.  After reviewing the record in the light most favorable to the appellants for any genuine issue of a material fact that would preclude summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Rogers v. Fair, 902 F.2d 140, 143 (1st Cir.1990), we find that the district court was correct in holding that Dartmouth and the other appellees were entitled to a judgment in their favor as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a state, or a political subdivision thereof, distinguishes between two similarly situated groups, the distinctions it makes are subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Such scrutiny is normally of the rational basis variety unless the distinction involves a suspect classification or burdens a fundamental right.  Nordlinger v. Hahn, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 2331-32, 120 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992);  Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 17, 99 S.Ct. 887, 898, 59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979) (citing New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976));  Campos v. I.N.S., 961 F.2d 309, 316 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In judging the constitutionality of Dartmouth's use fee, the district court applied the rational basis standard of scrutiny because the fee did not penalize the right to travel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or any other fundamental right, and it did not invoke a suspect classification.  See Hawaii Boating Ass'n v. Water Transp. Facilities Div., Dept. of Transp., 651 F.2d 661, 664-66 (9th Cir.1981).  For the same reasons, the district court appropriately applied the rational basis level of scrutiny to assess appellants' Due Process claim as well.  See Baker v. Concord, 916 F.2d 744, 755 (1st Cir.1990);  In re Wood, 866 F.2d 1367, 1371 (11th Cir.1989).  On appeal, appellants fail to point out any error in the judge's finding that no fundamental right or suspect classification is implicated in this case.  Thus, to the extent they challenge the level of scrutiny applied to Dartmouth's use fee,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we invoke \"the settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 468 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under rational basis scrutiny, a classification will withstand a constitutional challenge as long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest and is neither arbitrary, unreasonable nor irrational.  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985);  Baker, 916 F.2d at 747.   Courts applying the rational basis standard must give considerable deference to legislative policy determinations and refrain from setting aside a statutory discrimination if \"any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\"  Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 US 587, 600-01, 107 S.Ct. 3008, 3017, 97 L.Ed.2d 485 (1987) (quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970));  accord, Nordlinger, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2332;  Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. at 17, 99 S.Ct. at 898.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth argued, and the district court found, that the disparate structure of the use fee is rationally related to the goal of \"fairly distributing harbor costs to all users\" and thus equalizing the otherwise disproportionate burdens between residents and nonresidents of maintaining the harbor.  Appellants claim that no such disproportionate burdens are imposed on residents and that nonresidents do pay an equal share of harbor costs absent the disparate usage fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Appellants attempt to distinguish the instant case from two cases that upheld disparate usage fees between residents and nonresidents, Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm'n, 436 U.S. 371, 388-91, 98 S.Ct. 1852, 1863-64, 56 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and Hawaii Boating, 651 F.2d at 666,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> on the grounds that the nonresidents in those cases did not contribute financially to the state other than through the challenged fees.  In this case, appellants argue that nonresidents, such as themselves, do contribute to the town's general fund by paying the state excise tax on boats (50% of which goes to the Dartmouth's general fund) and by paying $2,450 in slip rental fees to a yacht club that pays real estate taxes.  They conclude that, because resident and nonresident boaters shoulder all the costs equally, Dartmouth is really seeking to impose greater burdens on nonresidents in order to lessen the burdens on residents, a policy that purportedly bears no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' challenge of the use fee essentially boils down to an attack on the reasonableness of Dartmouth's assessment of its own harbor related revenues and expenses.  As a result, they undertake the very difficult burden of showing that a government's financial planning, calculation and analysis is unreasonable to the point of irrationality.  See generally Nordlinger, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2332 (noting that states have \"large leeway\" in creating distinctions in their tax laws);  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390-91, 98 S.Ct. at 1863-64 (finding no need for state to precisely justify the cost differential between hunting license fees charged to residents and nonresidents);  Baker, 916 F.2d at 747-48 (finding the use of classifications that lack \"mathematical nicety\" and contain other imperfections does not violate the Equal Protection Clause).  Appellants cannot sustain this burden if the record evidences any reasonable basis for Dartmouth to believe that there was a disparity in waterways contributions between residents and nonresidents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record clearly shows that such a basis exists.  Dartmouth spends all of the money from its waterways fund, consisting of $118,042 in resident and nonresident contributions, on waterways related expenses.  The town must then spend an additional $127,888.23 for municipal services provided to the harbor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Unlike the waterways fund, this money comes primarily from residents through real estate and fire district taxes.  There is thus a disproportionate burden on residents for harbor expenses even after the disparate fees are imposed.   Clearly, Dartmouth's attempt to make up some of this disparity through a disparate fee structure passes constitutional muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that they contribute equally to the town's general fund even though they do not pay real estate or fire district taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  They point first to their payment of the Massachusetts boat excise tax, half of which is deposited into Dartmouth's general fund.  Aside from the fact that both residents and nonresident boaters pay this tax equally, appellants' argument fails because the revenues from the excise tax do not even come close to covering the shortfall in harbor costs which residents must pay for.  Only $28,122 was placed into the town's general fund from the excise taxes.  Even if we incorrectly attribute this entire amount to nonresident contributors, we still have a shortfall for harbor related expenses of $99,766.23 ($127,888.23 in municipal services minus $28,122.00 in excise tax revenues going to the general fund).  Thus, with the excise taxes included in the calculus, there still remains a sizeable pool of funds used for harbor services to which residents disproportionately contribute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, appellants argue that their payment of slip rental fees compensates for any inequality between themselves and other residents because those fees are paid to the New Bedford Yacht Club which itself, allegedly, pays real estate taxes to Dartmouth's general fund.  Appellants made this argument to the district court during the hearing and in appellants' supplemental memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  We question whether the manner in which appellants raised the issue was sufficient to properly place it before the district court as the record contains no affidavit or other evidentiary foundation, beyond the mere statements by appellants' counsel, concerning the alleged fact that appellants paid slip rental fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the fact that appellants pay slip rental fees does not present any question of material fact as to the rationality of Dartmouth's use fee schedule.  First of all, there is nothing in the record indicating how much, if any, real estate taxes are paid by the Yacht Club and what percentage, if any, of those taxes are attributable to slip fees paid by appellants.  Appellants' argument is thus a mere assertion which is insufficient to raise a triable issue.  Rogers v. Fair, 902 F.2d 140, 143 (1st Cir.1990) (finding that the nonmovant must adduce specific, provable facts to defeat an otherwise proper summary judgment motion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that some amount of the slip fees paid by appellants are passed on to Dartmouth's general fund, however, the town could still reasonably conclude that the level of nonresident contributions is less than the total tax burden imposed on residents.  Not all nonresident boaters pay slip rental fees;  many simply moor their boats in the harbor without renting space from a Yacht Club or other private organization.  In the case of nonresident boaters who do pay slip rental fees, one might reasonably conclude that yacht clubs are unable to pass on to their boating customers the entire pro rata share of municipal taxes attributable to boaters who rent slips.  Dartmouth could reasonably conclude that, for various economic reasons, businesses can increase their prices by only some fraction of the tax imposed on them.  Under this assumption, boaters renting slips would pay a proportionately smaller share of real estate taxes than residents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Dartmouth's general rule that distinguishes between residents, who directly pay municipal taxes, and nonresidents, who contribute indirectly or not at all, is rationally related to the disproportionate burdens placed on harbor users, even though this rule may overlook some variations in the contributions made by individual nonresident boaters.  See Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 391, 98 S.Ct. at 1864 (\"We perceive no duty on the State to have its licensing structure parallel or identical for both residents and nonresidents, or to justify to the penny any cost differential it imposes in a purely recreational, noncommercial, nonlivelihood setting.\");  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) (\"If the classification has some 'reasonable basis,' it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification 'is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.' \")  (quoting Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911)).  In this case, we fail to see how Dartmouth's alleged failure to consider the payment of slip rental fees when implementing its use fee could constitute an unreasonableness of constitutional proportions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants finally contend that their payment of slip rental fees puts them in substantially the same position as other parties that qualify as \"residents\" under Dartmouth's use fee ordinance.  \"Residents\" include registered voters of Dartmouth and persons domiciled in Dartmouth.  Both classifications encompass persons, such as renters and those living with friends or relatives, who, like appellants and other nonresidents, either do not pay any real estate taxes to the town or only pay taxes indirectly through rental payments.  The residency definition also includes, as a separate category, persons paying real estate taxes to Dartmouth;  this implies that the other residency categories refer to nontaxpayers.  Appellants argue that because the use fee definition of a resident includes many \"residents\" who make the same contribution to Dartmouth's general fund as nonresidents make, the fee structure is not rationally related to the goal of equalizing the burdens of harbor maintenance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth responds, reasonably we think, that it tried to make its residency definition as liberal as possible while at the same time imposing a larger fee on people who use its waterways exclusively without contributing much to the town's general fund.  In broadening the residency definition to include persons other than local taxpayers, the town may reasonably conclude that renters and voters make other contributions to the town--by, for example, participating in local community life and in the local economy--that nonresident boaters do not make.  Cf. Nordlinger, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2335 (\"For purposes of rational-basis review, the 'latitude of discretion is notably wide in ... the granting of partial or total [tax] exemptions upon grounds of policy.' \")  (quoting F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S.Ct. 560, 562, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920)).  In the context of a broader fee schedule that generally distinguishes between persons who are more likely to pay property taxes and persons who are less likely to pay property taxes, Dartmouth's decision to treat renters of a boat slip differently from renters of a dwelling does not constitute impermissible discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a statute need not be precisely tailored to fit its legislative goal in order to meet the rational relationship test.  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390, 98 S.Ct. at 1863 (\" 'That [the state] might have furthered its underlying purpose more artfully, more directly, or more completely, does not warrant a conclusion that the method it chose is unconstitutional.' \")  (quoting Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 813, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2499, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976));  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 316-17, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2568-69, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976).  The fit between Dartmouth's residency definition and the goal of equalizing burdens among boaters may not be precise or entirely consistent, but neither is it so tenuous as to render the ordinance irrational under the Constitution.  We find, therefore, that Dartmouth's use fee is sufficiently related to a legitimate legislative goal to pass constitutional scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>III. IMPERMISSIBLE REGULATION OF THE WATERWAYS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that Dartmouth's discriminatory use fee constitutes an impermissible regulation of the nation's waterways.  In addition, they argue that Dartmouth's actions in this case are preempted by extensive federal legislation and regulation in this area.  In conclusion, appellants state that \"Dartmouth's actions in assessing the use fees is, therefore, violative of the commerce clause in that it (1) is preempted by federal legislation and (2) it unreasonably impairs access to navigable waters\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent appellants' impermissible regulation claims depend on the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, as the above language suggests, we are unable to consider them in our review of the summary judgment decision.  The district court found that appellants lacked standing to raise a claim under the Commerce Clause and appellants do not challenge this finding on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Even if these claims are independent of the Commerce Clause, however, they lack sufficient merit to require a reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are correct in their observation that navigable waters of the United States are public property and cannot be obstructed or impeded so as to impair the right to their navigation.  Harman v. Chicago, 147 U.S. 396, 412, 13 S.Ct. 306, 312, 37 L.Ed. 216 (1893).  However, they are also correct in acknowledging that a state may exact a reasonable harbor fee to defray the costs of harbor traffic.  Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama, 296 U.S. 261, 267, 56 S.Ct. 194, 197, 80 L.Ed. 215 (1935).  In the present case, appellants fail to point out how Dartmouth's disparate usage fee impairs access to navigable waters in any way, unreasonably or otherwise.  Boaters can pass through Dartmouth and even stay in Dartmouth for a few nights without being required to pay any usage fee at all.  Furthermore, the use fee, as discussed above, provides a reasonable method of defraying the costs of waterways maintenance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also provide no support for their claim that federal law preempts Dartmouth's use fee.  \"[W]here a congressional statute does not expressly declare that state law is to be pre-empted, and where there is no actual conflict between what federal law and state law prescribe, [the Supreme Court has] required that there be evidence of a congressional intent to pre-empt the specific field covered by the state law.\"  Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Revenue, 477 U.S. 1, 6, 106 S.Ct. 2369, 2772, 91 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986);  accord Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct. 2476, 2481-82, 115 L.Ed.2d 532 (1991).  For a preemption claim to succeed, the intention of Congress must be clearly manifested, implicit from a pervasive scheme of federal regulation that leaves no room for state and local supplementation, or implicit from the fact that the federal law touches a field in which \"the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\"  Mortier, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2481-82 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have failed to demonstrate any intent on the part of Congress to preempt boat user fees, nor have they shown any conflict between federal waterways laws and the state and local laws in this case.  None of the legislation cited by appellants--The River and Harbor Improvements Acts, 33 U.S.C. Secs. 540-633;  The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1954, Pub.L. No. 83-780, Sec. 101, 68 Stat. 1248, 1253;  and the proposed but not enacted Shipbuilding Trade Reform Act, most recent version at H.R. 2056, 102d Cong., 2d Sess.  (1992)--express any intent to preempt local user fees, nor do we find a pervasive regulatory scheme or dominant federal interest that precludes such fees.  The fact that federal law has implemented boater use fees does not, by itself, present a conflict with local fees of the same nature where there is no reason to believe that the two fees cannot coincide or that the local fee interferes in some way with the federal one.  Appellants provide no basis for finding such interference.  Consequently, we find no federal preemption of Dartmouth's use fee.  Cf. Beveridge v. Lewis, 939 F.2d 859 (9th Cir.1991) (finding no federal preemption of local moorage restrictions by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C.

Appellants cite Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U.S. 869, 105 S.Ct. 1676, 84 L.Ed.2d 751 (1985), for the proposition that disparate excise taxes between residents and nonresidents violate the Constitution</p>\n        <p>Without delving into the issue of whether the use fee is really a fee or a tax, it is sufficient for our purposes to note that Metropolitan Life held that using a discriminatory tax to encourage the formation of domestic companies at the expense of foreign companies was not a legitimate purpose under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 876-83, 105 S.Ct. at 1680-84.   That holding does not apply to the present case because, unlike the tax at issue in Metropolitan Life, the aim of Dartmouth's use fee is to equalize disproportionate burdens, not to favor locals at the expense of nonresidents.  It is also significant that Dartmouth applies all of the revenues it receives from the usage fee for nonresident boaters to the maintenance of waterways utilized by those boaters and not to Dartmouth's general fund.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court in Baldwin upheld a Montana statute that imposed on nonresidents much higher fees for certain hunting licenses than it imposed on residents because the \"legislative choice was an economic means not unreasonably related to the preservation of a finite resource and a substantial regulatory interest of the State.\"  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390, 98 S.Ct. at 1863</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In Hawaii Boating, the Ninth Circuit upheld a state statute that assessed higher moorage fees to nonresidents than to residents because the disparate rates were rationally related to the \"valid legislative goal\" of \"equalizing costs attendant to maintaining and constructing small boat harbors....\"  Hawaii Boating, 651 F.2d at 666.   As the district court correctly noted, the usage fee upheld in that case is quite similar to the fee challenged in the instant case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The Fourteenth Amendment also requires that Dartmouth's disparate fee structure not be unreasonably disproportionate to the size of the disparity it purports to correct.  This issue is not before us, however, because appellants have not raised it on appeal.  Furthermore, the additional fees charged to nonresidents do not exceed the $127,888.23 shortfall which the residents must make up</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact existed with regard to the alleged \"shortfall\" between the revenues collected from waterways related levies and the expenses attributable to the waterways.  In its supplemental memorandum to the district court, appellants disputed the $127,888.23 figure provided by the town because it included several items that, allegedly, do not belong on the list.  The challenged items include the cost of grading the town landing ($1,065.19), the cost of certain police services ($24,451.00), and several unspecified expenses involving town services that supposedly receive state or federal funding.  Appellants' objections do not raise any disputed issue of material fact because the objections do not deny that some shortfall exists.  Were the court to take all of appellants' objections as true, Dartmouth would still have a $100,000 shortfall minus some unspecified fraction of state and federal funding.  As long as some shortfall exists, and as long as that shortfall is made up by Dartmouth's general tax levy, the precise size of that shortfall is irrelevant for purposes of judging the rationality of the use fee at issue.  More importantly, none of appellants' objections to the $127,888.23 figure raises an issue as to whether Dartmouth's perception that residents were paying a disproportionate share of harbor costs was unreasonable or irrational</p>\n        <p>Because appellants raised no genuine issue of material fact, the district court was not, as appellants claim, obligated to allow them to present conflicting testimony and other additional evidence or to cross-examine Dartmouth's witnesses before granting summary judgment.</p>\n        <p>To the extent appellants attack the overall credibility of the affiants and the veracity of the information contained in their affidavits, such objections were never raised before the district court and thus are waived on appeal.

As the district court correctly pointed out, \"the relevant question is not really whether the costs of certain waterfront services are attributable to nonresidents' use of the harbor, but instead whether nonresidents avail themselves of those services and can thus fairly be required to pay their share of the costs.\"   Appellants' argument is irrelevant to the issue of whether nonresidents are contributing equally to the entire pool of funds used for waterway maintenance.  The presence of such an inequality is all that is required to find Dartmouth's use fee rationally related to a legitimate legislative goal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We do not consider the further and very questionable proposition that if the amounts from the excise tax closed the gap between harbor related expenses and harbor related revenues, Dartmouth would, on that basis alone, violate the Fourteenth Amendment by imposing the disparate use fee.

As nonresidents, appellants must pay a higher fee than residents with similarly sized boats.  Although the Constitution does place limits on a town's ability to tax users of America's waterways, we find that the actions taken by Dartmouth in this case do not implicate such limits.

The fund is financed by a waterways use fee (the \"use fee\") which is levied by the town upon all boat owners who use the waterways of Dartmouth for more than limited periods of time.

Appellant LCM owns a fifty foot boat and appellant Capobianco owns a fifteen foot boat.  Both boats are habitually moored or docked in Dartmouth.  LCM and Capobianco must pay use fees of $130 and $50 respectively.

The Commonwealth imposes the tax but directs cities and towns to collect the tax and use it for waterway maintenance.  All boat owners pay the excise tax according to the same formula regardless of their place of residence.  In addition, the appellants claim that they pay $2,450 in slip rental fees to the New Bedford Yacht Club which, they point out, pays real estate taxes to Dartmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth places the money it collects from the disputed use fee, along with other revenues from boating and shellfish licenses and permits, in the waterways fund.  Dartmouth also deposits 50% of the Massachusetts excise taxes on boats that it collects into the fund.  The other 50% of the excise tax revenue is placed into the town's general fund.  According to affidavits provided by town officials, Dartmouth collected a total of $118,042 in revenues for the waterways fund for fiscal year 1992 including $58,874 in Usage Fees and $28,122 in excise taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same Dartmouth affidavits reveal that the town spent $111,276 in fiscal year 1992 on port related services such as waterway maintenance, capital improvements and operating expenses plus an additional $17,217 for overhead costs attributable to town administration expenses.  These expenses were paid for entirely out of the waterways fund and consumed all fund revenues for fiscal year 1992.  According to town officials, the town also spent $127,888.23 on municipal services provided to the waterfront and harbor including police, fire, sanitation, and other such services.  Dartmouth paid for these costs out of its general fund which depends on the town's general tax levy, namely real estate taxes and fire district taxes, for its revenues.  Dartmouth also presented evidence showing that its harbor related expenses were increasing significantly every year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1991, appellants filed suit against Dartmouth contending that the facial disparity in the assessment and collection of the use fee constituted impermissible discrimination under the Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Both sides moved for summary judgment and, initially, both agreed that no genuine issues of material fact existed in the case.  After a hearing on the motions, however, appellants submitted a supplemental memorandum in which they challenged some of the factual assertions contained in the appellees' affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then granted summary judgment in favor of Dartmouth and the other appellees.  The court found that appellants lacked standing to raise a Commerce Clause challenge because they used their boats only for recreational purposes and did not engage in any commercial activity that would be affected by the use fee.  In ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment claims, the district court found that Dartmouth's actions did not burden a fundamental right nor invoke a suspect classification;  consequently, the fee scheme need only be rationally related to a legitimate purpose in order to pass Constitutional scrutiny.  The district court granted summary judgment because it found Dartmouth's fee structure was rationally related to the legitimate goal of equitably distributing the growing costs of waterway maintenance between residents and nonresidents.  Noting that Dartmouth had to use money from its general fund to cover the shortfall between total costs attributable to the harbor and total revenues from the waterways fund, the district court found that the disparate fee structure was rationally related to the goal of equalizing the burdens between residents, who pay real estate and fire district taxes to the general fund, and nonresidents, who contribute little to the general fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellants challenge the Equal Protection and Due Process rulings and the trial court's implicit conclusion that there are no disputed issues of material fact to justify summary judgment.  Appellants also raise related claims based on the theory that Dartmouth's fee is an impermissible regulation of the waterways.

Appellants claim that no such disproportionate burdens are imposed on residents and that nonresidents do pay an equal share of harbor costs absent the disparate usage fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Appellants attempt to distinguish the instant case from two cases that upheld disparate usage fees between residents and nonresidents, Baldwin v.

In this case, appellants argue that nonresidents, such as themselves, do contribute to the town's general fund by paying the state excise tax on boats (50% of which goes to the Dartmouth's general fund) and by paying $2,450 in slip rental fees to a yacht club that pays real estate taxes.  They conclude that, because resident and nonresident boaters shoulder all the costs equally, Dartmouth is really seeking to impose greater burdens on nonresidents in order to lessen the burdens on residents, a policy that purportedly bears no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' challenge of the use fee essentially boils down to an attack on the reasonableness of Dartmouth's assessment of its own harbor related revenues and expenses.  As a result, they undertake the very difficult burden of showing that a government's financial planning, calculation and analysis is unreasonable to the point of irrationality.  See generally Nordlinger, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2332 (noting that states have \"large leeway\" in creating distinctions in their tax laws);  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390-91, 98 S.Ct. at 1863-64 (finding no need for state to precisely justify the cost differential between hunting license fees charged to residents and nonresidents);  Baker, 916 F.2d at 747-48 (finding the use of classifications that lack \"mathematical nicety\" and contain other imperfections does not violate the Equal Protection Clause).  Appellants cannot sustain this burden if the record evidences any reasonable basis for Dartmouth to believe that there was a disparity in waterways contributions between residents and nonresidents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record clearly shows that such a basis exists.  Dartmouth spends all of the money from its waterways fund, consisting of $118,042 in resident and nonresident contributions, on waterways related expenses.  The town must then spend an additional $127,888.23 for municipal services provided to the harbor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Unlike the waterways fund, this money comes primarily from residents through real estate and fire district taxes.  There is thus a disproportionate burden on residents for harbor expenses even after the disparate fees are imposed.   Clearly, Dartmouth's attempt to make up some of this disparity through a disparate fee structure passes constitutional muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that they contribute equally to the town's general fund even though they do not pay real estate or fire district taxes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  They point first to their payment of the Massachusetts boat excise tax, half of which is deposited into Dartmouth's general fund.  Aside from the fact that both residents and nonresident boaters pay this tax equally, appellants' argument fails because the revenues from the excise tax do not even come close to covering the shortfall in harbor costs which residents must pay for.  Only $28,122 was placed into the town's general fund from the excise taxes.  Even if we incorrectly attribute this entire amount to nonresident contributors, we still have a shortfall for harbor related expenses of $99,766.23 ($127,888.23 in municipal services minus $28,122.00 in excise tax revenues going to the general fund).  Thus, with the excise taxes included in the calculus, there still remains a sizeable pool of funds used for harbor services to which residents disproportionately contribute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, appellants argue that their payment of slip rental fees compensates for any inequality between themselves and other residents because those fees are paid to the New Bedford Yacht Club which itself, allegedly, pays real estate taxes to Dartmouth's general fund.  Appellants made this argument to the district court during the hearing and in appellants' supplemental memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  We question whether the manner in which appellants raised the issue was sufficient to properly place it before the district court as the record contains no affidavit or other evidentiary foundation, beyond the mere statements by appellants' counsel, concerning the alleged fact that appellants paid slip rental fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the fact that appellants pay slip rental fees does not present any question of material fact as to the rationality of Dartmouth's use fee schedule.  First of all, there is nothing in the record indicating how much, if any, real estate taxes are paid by the Yacht Club and what percentage, if any, of those taxes are attributable to slip fees paid by appellants.  Appellants' argument is thus a mere assertion which is insufficient to raise a triable issue.  Rogers v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540781\"><a href=\"/opinion/540781/ralph-rogers-v-michael-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir.1990) (finding that the nonmovant must adduce specific, provable facts to defeat an otherwise proper summary judgment motion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that some amount of the slip fees paid by appellants are passed on to Dartmouth's general fund, however, the town could still reasonably conclude that the level of nonresident contributions is less than the total tax burden imposed on residents.  Not all nonresident boaters pay slip rental fees;  many simply moor their boats in the harbor without renting space from a Yacht Club or other private organization.  In the case of nonresident boaters who do pay slip rental fees, one might reasonably conclude that yacht clubs are unable to pass on to their boating customers the entire pro rata share of municipal taxes attributable to boaters who rent slips.  Dartmouth could reasonably conclude that, for various economic reasons, businesses can increase their prices by only some fraction of the tax imposed on them.  Under this assumption, boaters renting slips would pay a proportionately smaller share of real estate taxes than residents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Dartmouth's general rule that distinguishes between residents, who directly pay municipal taxes, and nonresidents, who contribute indirectly or not at all, is rationally related to the disproportionate burdens placed on harbor users, even though this rule may overlook some variations in the contributions made by individual nonresident boaters.  See Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 391, 98 S.Ct. at 1864 (\"We perceive no duty on the State to have its licensing structure parallel or identical for both residents and nonresidents, or to justify to the penny any cost differential it imposes in a purely recreational, noncommercial, nonlivelihood setting.\");  Dandridge v.

Both classifications encompass persons, such as renters and those living with friends or relatives, who, like appellants and other nonresidents, either do not pay any real estate taxes to the town or only pay taxes indirectly through rental payments.  The residency definition also includes, as a separate category, persons paying real estate taxes to Dartmouth;  this implies that the other residency categories refer to nontaxpayers.  Appellants argue that because the use fee definition of a resident includes many \"residents\" who make the same contribution to Dartmouth's general fund as nonresidents make, the fee structure is not rationally related to the goal of equalizing the burdens of harbor maintenance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dartmouth responds, reasonably we think, that it tried to make its residency definition as liberal as possible while at the same time imposing a larger fee on people who use its waterways exclusively without contributing much to the town's general fund.  In broadening the residency definition to include persons other than local taxpayers, the town may reasonably conclude that renters and voters make other contributions to the town--by, for example, participating in local community life and in the local economy--that nonresident boaters do not make.

The fit between Dartmouth's residency definition and the goal of equalizing burdens among boaters may not be precise or entirely consistent, but neither is it so tenuous as to render the ordinance irrational under the Constitution.

In addition, they argue that Dartmouth's actions in this case are preempted by extensive federal legislation and regulation in this area.

In the present case, appellants fail to point out how Dartmouth's disparate usage fee impairs access to navigable waters in any way, unreasonably or otherwise.

For a preemption claim to succeed, the intention of Congress must be clearly manifested, implicit from a pervasive scheme of federal regulation that leaves no room for state and local supplementation, or implicit from the fact that the federal law touches a field in which \"the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\"  Mortier, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2481-82 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have failed to demonstrate any intent on the part of Congress to preempt boat user fees, nor have they shown any conflict between federal waterways laws and the state and local laws in this case.  None of the legislation cited by appellants--The River and Harbor Improvements Acts, 33 U.S.C. Secs. 540-633;  The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1954, Pub.L. No. 83-780, Sec. 101, 68 Stat. 1248, 1253;  and the proposed but not enacted Shipbuilding Trade Reform Act, most recent version at H.R. 2056, 102d Cong., 2d Sess.  (1992)--express any intent to preempt local user fees, nor do we find a pervasive regulatory scheme or dominant federal interest that precludes such fees.  The fact that federal law has implemented boater use fees does not, by itself, present a conflict with local fees of the same nature where there is no reason to believe that the two fees cannot coincide or that the local fee interferes in some way with the federal one.  Appellants provide no basis for finding such interference.  Consequently, we find no federal preemption of Dartmouth's use fee.  Cf. Beveridge v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span> (1985), for the proposition that disparate excise taxes between residents and nonresidents violate the Constitution</p>\n        <p>Without delving into the issue of whether the use fee is really a fee or a tax, it is sufficient for our purposes to note that Metropolitan Life held that using a discriminatory tax to encourage the formation of domestic companies at the expense of foreign companies was not a legitimate purpose under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 876-83, 105 S.Ct. at 1680-84.   That holding does not apply to the present case because, unlike the tax at issue in Metropolitan Life, the aim of Dartmouth's use fee is to equalize disproportionate burdens, not to favor locals at the expense of nonresidents.  It is also significant that Dartmouth applies all of the revenues it receives from the usage fee for nonresident boaters to the maintenance of waterways utilized by those boaters and not to Dartmouth's general fund.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court in Baldwin upheld a Montana statute that imposed on nonresidents much higher fees for certain hunting licenses than it imposed on residents because the \"legislative choice was an economic means not unreasonably related to the preservation of a finite resource and a substantial regulatory interest of the State.\"  Baldwin, 436 U.S. at 390, 98 S.Ct. at 1863</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In Hawaii Boating, the Ninth Circuit upheld a state statute that assessed higher moorage fees to nonresidents than to residents because the disparate rates were rationally related to the \"valid legislative goal\" of \"equalizing costs attendant to maintaining and constructing small boat harbors....\"  Hawaii Boating, 651 F.2d at 666.   As the district court correctly noted, the usage fee upheld in that case is quite similar to the fee challenged in the instant case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The Fourteenth Amendment also requires that Dartmouth's disparate fee structure not be unreasonably disproportionate to the size of the disparity it purports to correct.  This issue is not before us, however, because appellants have not raised it on appeal.  Furthermore, the additional fees charged to nonresidents do not exceed the $127,888.23 shortfall which the residents must make up</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact existed with regard to the alleged \"shortfall\" between the revenues collected from waterways related levies and the expenses attributable to the waterways.  In its supplemental memorandum to the district court, appellants disputed the $127,888.23 figure provided by the town because it included several items that, allegedly, do not belong on the list.  The challenged items include the cost of grading the town landing ($1,065.19), the cost of certain police services ($24,451.00), and several unspecified expenses involving town services that supposedly receive state or federal funding.  Appellants' objections do not raise any disputed issue of material fact because the objections do not deny that some shortfall exists.  Were the court to take all of appellants' objections as true, Dartmouth would still have a $100,000 shortfall minus some unspecified fraction of state and federal funding.  As long as some shortfall exists, and as long as that shortfall is made up by Dartmouth's general tax levy, the precise size of that shortfall is irrelevant for purposes of judging the rationality of the use fee at issue.  More importantly, none of appellants' objections to the $127,888.23 figure raises an issue as to whether Dartmouth's perception that residents were paying a disproportionate share of harbor costs was unreasonable or irrational</p>\n        <p>Because appellants raised no genuine issue of material fact, the district court was not, as appellants claim, obligated to allow them to present conflicting testimony and other additional evidence or to cross-examine Dartmouth's witnesses before granting summary judgment.</p>\n        <p>To the extent appellants attack the overall credibility of the affiants and the veracity of the information contained in their affidavits, such objections were never raised before the district court and thus are waived on appeal.
