Born and Mills and Born, Attorneys at Law were on\nbrief for petitioners.\n     Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, Richard M. Evans,\nAssistant Director and Kevin J. Conway, Attorney, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Civil Division, United States Department of\nJustice, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           January 31, 2011\n\f               HOWARD, Circuit Judge.    Isaias Perez Socop (\"Perez\") and\n\nhis spouse Isabel Boj Xum (\"Boj\"), both natives and citizens of\n\nGuatemala, entered the United States illegally and were placed in\n\nremoval    proceedings.          Conceding    removability,    both   sought\n\nwithholding of removal on the ground that it was more likely than\n\nnot that they would be persecuted if they returned to Guatemala.\n\n               Claims for withholding of removal require the persecution\n\nin question to be \"on account of\" one of five protected grounds:\n\n\"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup or political opinion.\"          See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(b)(3)(A).        In\n\naddition to each petitioner's claims based on asserted group\n\nmembership, the petitioners also claimed that Perez's resistance to\n\ngang recruitment qualified as \"political opinion\" for which they\n\nfaced persecution.\n\n               An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied their applications,\n\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the denials.\n\nThe Board's rationale was the same in both cases:           the petitioners\n\nhad failed to identify a protected ground on which to base their\n\nwithholding of removal claims.          The BIA concluded that the social\n\ngroups    in    which   the   petitioners    claimed   membership   were   not\n\ncognizable \"particular social group[s]\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute.       The Board further concluded that Perez's resistance to\n\ngang recruitment, standing alone, did not qualify as a \"political\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fopinion\" and that the gangs did not impute a political opinion to\n\nhis spouse based on this resistance.\n\n             Perez and Boj individually petitioned for judicial review\n\nof the BIA's orders.           We deny the petitions, except for an\n\nunexhausted claim which we dismiss.\n\n                                     I.    Facts\n\n             The facts presented here are undisputed.             Both Perez and\n\nBoj   were   born   in   a   small    Guatemalan      village    to   families   of\n\nindigenous Mayan Quiche ancestry.               They married at a young age.     At\n\nsome point, Perez began a construction job in Guatemala City,\n\nreturning to his village and family on weekends.                      While he was\n\nworking at this job, members from a gang -- the \"Maras\" --\n\napproached him and attempted to recruit him.                    Perez refused to\n\njoin, testifying later that he was opposed to the gang's practices\n\nand values.     His refusal to join resulted in the gang demanding\n\nhalf of his weekly salary as \"penitence.\"                Perez paid this money,\n\nfearing that if he did not pay, the gang would harm him or his\n\nfamily as it had others who refused to make payments.\n\n             Perez paid this money for approximately five years.                 In\n\n2000, however, tired of paying the gang, Perez decided to leave for\n\nthe United States.       Because he could not afford to bring his wife\n\nand two children with him, Perez planned to send for them when he\n\nhad earned enough money.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f             When the extorted payments ceased, the gang sent one of\n\nits members, Mauricio Ismael, to harass Boj.                Ismael raped Boj\n\nrepeatedly over the course of three months. Boj became pregnant as\n\na result but miscarried after being beaten by Ismael.                Boj never\n\nreported these crimes to the government in Guatemala, because, she\n\ntestified, of her belief that the government ignores complaints\n\nfrom indigenous women.\n\n             Eventually, Perez sent money to Boj so that she and their\n\nchildren could join him in the United States.              After her arrival,\n\nBoj   was   treated    for   mental   health    problems   arising   from   her\n\nexperiences in Guatemala.\n\n             In support of their requests for withholding of removal,\n\nPerez and Boj submitted documentary evidence of country conditions\n\nin Guatemala, including a U.S. Department of State Country Report\n\nfor 2006.      This evidence revealed that \"societal violence [in\n\nGuatemala] was widespread\" with non-state actors (including gangs)\n\ncommitting \"hundreds of killings and other crimes.\"                  The gangs\n\npreyed on women in particular, with authorities attributing to\n\ngangs many of the gender-based crimes, including sexual assault and\n\nmurder.     The evidence also indicated, however, that the Guatemalan\n\ngovernment had made efforts to combat the gang menace.                  A 2005\n\nreport      stated    that   Guatemala's       president    supported    \"both\n\nstrengthening law enforcement capacity to combat criminal gangs,\n\nand expanding gang prevention and social rehabilitation programs.\"\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fIt also noted that the \"Guatemalan Congress is considering tough\n\nanti-gang legislation that would try gang members ages 12 and older\n\nas adults, and establish lengthy sentences for gang leaders.\"\n\n          As stated, the IJ rejected the petitioners' withholding\n\nclaims, and the BIA affirmed.\n\n                              II.   Discussion\n\n                        A.    Standards of review\n\n          We   review   the    agency's     findings    of   fact   under    the\n\n\"substantial   evidence\"     standard,     upholding    those   findings    \"if\n\nsupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\"       Castillo-Diaz v. Holder, 562 F.3d\n\n23, 26 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).                  This\n\nstandard of review is deferential; we will reverse only if the\n\nrecord evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a\n\ncontrary determination.       8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B).         We review the\n\nagency's abstract legal determinations de novo.              Lopez-Castro v.\n\nHolder, 577 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2009).               We accord deference,\n\nhowever, to the agency's reasonable interpretations of statutes and\n\nregulations that fall within its purview.         Id.\n\n          In the cases before us, the BIA affirmed the decisions of\n\nthe IJ with written decisions of its own.        In such cases, we review\n\nthe BIA's decisions, in addition to any portions of the IJ's\n\ndecisions adopted by the Board.          Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 53\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                        B.    Withholding of removal\n\n              To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must\n\nprove that, if she is repatriated, it is more likely than not that\n\nshe will be persecuted on account of one of five protected grounds:\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup or political opinion.         Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 85-86\n\n(1st   Cir.    2007).    To    qualify   as   persecution,      a   petitioner's\n\nexperience \"must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even\n\nbasic suffering.\"       Decky v. Holder, 587 F.3d 104, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).     Moreover,     \"[p]ersecution,      within    the   context    of    the\n\nimmigration statutes, does not include all treatment that our\n\nsociety    regards      as    unfair,    unjust,   or    even       unlawful    or\n\nunconstitutional.\"       Id. (quoting Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2007)).\n\n1. Perez\n\n              Perez claimed that he was persecuted and would face\n\nfuture persecution if returned to Guatemala due to his social group\n\nmembership and because of his political opinions regarding gangs.\n\nWe address these contentions in turn.\n\n              a. Particular social groups\n\n              The record reflects that the only social group membership\n\nassessed by the IJ was \"Guatemalans returning from the United\n\nStates\" who, according to Perez's testimony, would be harmed by\n\ngangs because they would be perceived to have money or valuable\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fgoods.       In addition, the BIA interpreted Perez's petition as\n\nalleging that he was a member of a group of \"young indigenous\n\nGuatemalan males who expressly oppose the practices and values of\n\nthe MS gang and wish to protect their families against such\n\npractices.\"\n\n              On appeal, however, Perez pursues a slightly different\n\ntack. To begin with, he does not address the \"returning expatriate\n\nfrom the United States\" claim in his brief. That argument is\n\ntherefore waived.      Le Bin Zhu v. Holder, 622 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).1      Next, in addition to membership in the gang-opposition\n\ngroup, he also claims on appeal membership in a particular social\n\ngroup as the husband of a rural, indigenous woman whose family has\n\nopposed gang members.     As this claim was not presented to the IJ or\n\nBIA,       we do not have jurisdiction to review it.   See 8 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1252(d)(1); Ahmed v. Holder, 611 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(\"[A]rguments not made before the BIA may not make their debut in\n\na petition for judicial review . . . .\").\n\n              Turning to the claim properly before us, the BIA found\n\nthat Perez's gang opposition did not make him part of a social\n\n\n       1\n      Even if we were to consider this claim, the Board's\nconclusion that gang members target anyone they believe can provide\nthem with money or valuables is well-supported by the record. As\nsuch, its conclusion that Perez would not be targeted \"on account\nof\" his membership in a group is unassailable. See Caal-Tiul v.\nHolder, 582 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"[S]ome social, gender,\nand economic groupings are almost always more vulnerable to crime\nand predation. This does not by itself amount to persecution . .\n. on one of the specific grounds required by the statute.\")\n\n                                   -7-\n\fgroup protected by immigration laws.              The Board relied on its\n\ndecision in Matter of S-E-G, et al., 24 I. & N. Dec. 579 (BIA\n\n2008), in which the Board held that Salvadoran youths who resisted\n\ngang recruitment do not constitute a particular social group.                  We\n\nfind       no   error   in   applying   controlling   BIA    case   law   to   the\n\nGuatemalan petitioner.           See Larios v. Holder, 608 F.3d 105, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 2010) (approving BIA application of Matter of S-E-G to\n\nGuatemalan petitioner claiming membership in group of Guatemalan\n\ngang resistors).2\n\n                b.   Political opinion\n\n                Perez's withholding of removal claim premised on his\n\nalleged political opinions fares no better.                 The BIA concluded,\n\nbased on its decision in Matter of E-A-G, 24 I. & N. Dec. 591 (BIA\n\n2008), that Perez's refusal to join a gang, without more, did not\n\nqualify as the expression of a political opinion.              This conclusion\n\nis supportable. In addition to the Board's own precedent, to which\n\nwe owe some deference, see Larios, 608 F.3d at 107, the Supreme\n\n\n       2\n      In July 2009, a few months after the BIA decision in this\nmatter, the BIA in Matter of S-E-G granted the parties' joint\nmotion to reopen and remand the matter so that the IJ could\nadministratively close the proceedings. The petitioners suggest\nthat this undermines the BIA's reliance on Matter of S-E-G, but\nthey have provided us with no indication that the BIA has\nreconsidered the precedential value of Matter of S-E-G. Moreover,\nin addition to our decision in Larios, several other circuits have\ncontinued to apply Matter of S-E-G to factual scenarios similar to\nthose presented in this case. See, e.g., Lizama v. Holder, No. 09-\n2027, 2011 WL 149874 at *6 (4th Cir. Jan. 19, 2011); Bonilla-\nMorales v. Holder, 607 F.3d 1132, 1137 (6th Cir. 2010) (dicta);\nLushaj v. Holder, 380 Fed. Appx. 41, 43 (2nd Cir. 2010).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCourt's opinion in INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992), is\n\non point.    In that case, the Court explained that a petitioner's\n\nresistance to recruitment into a guerilla movement, without more,\n\ndid not qualify as the expression of a political opinion.      Id. at\n\n481-82.   So it is here.   Nothing in the record suggests that Perez\n\noutwardly expressed any anti-gang message or that his resistance to\n\nthe gang was politically motivated.    The petitioner's reliance on\n\nhis mere resistance thus falls short.\n\n2. Boj\n\n            Boj also seeks withholding of removal due to persecution\n\non account of her membership in certain social groups and her\n\npolitical views.    We address the two categories seriatim.\n\n            a. Social groups\n\n            Boj claims that she suffered past persecution and will\n\nlikely suffer persecution upon her return to Guatemala due to her\n\nmembership in two particular social groups:     1) young Guatemalan\n\nindigenous females whose family members have expressly opposed gang\n\npractices and values; and 2) young indigenous Guatemalan women who\n\nare not protected from gangs by Guatemalan authorities.3\n\n            As to the first putative group, the BIA used the same\n\nreasoning that it did in rejecting Perez's claim:   that resistance\n\nto gang entreaties does not constitute a social group.        For the\n\n\n     3\n      The BIA addressed a \"returning expatriate\" claim similar to\nPerez's.   As that issue has not been raised on appeal, it is\nwaived.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fsame reasons set forth in our discussion of Perez's claim, we\n\ndecline to disturb the BIA's conclusion.               The BIA approached the\n\nsecond alleged group differently.               Without necessarily deciding\n\nwhether the stated categories of females qualified as a particular\n\nsocial group, the Board concluded that Boj had failed to show that\n\nthe   claimed    persecution      was     \"on    account\"    of   that   group's\n\ncharacteristics.     We agree.\n\n            To make out a successful withholding of removal claim,\n\nBoj must satisfy a nexus requirement, that is, she needs to\n\nestablish that the persecution feared will be on account of a\n\nprotected ground.        Sompotan v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     The BIA determined that Boj had failed to establish that\n\nthe gang members harmed her because of her status as a Guatemalan\n\nindigenous female.         This conclusion is fully supported by the\n\nrecord.    The testimony of the petitioners indicates that the gang\n\nmembers targeted Boj because her husband stopped making extortion\n\npayments    to   them,    not   because   she    was   an   indigenous   female.\n\nAccordingly, the BIA's decision stands.\n\n            b. Political opinion\n\n            For her part, Boj claims that gang members imputed an\n\nanti-gang political opinion to her when her husband refused to join\n\nthem and stopped paying them money.             Although an imputed political\n\nopinion may form the basis for a withholding claim, Vasquez v. INS,\n\n177 F.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 1999), nothing in the record indicates\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthat the gang members imputed an anti-gang political opinion to\n\nBoj.       And, as noted, nothing about Perez's resistance to the gang\n\nwould lead the gang's members to attribute a political opinion to\n\nhim or to his wife.        The BIA's decision on this issue easily clears\n\nthe \"substantial evidence\" hurdle.4\n\n               As a coda to Boj's claim, our decision here is not in any\n\nway an attempt to downplay the horrors that she endured. According\n\nto the reports in the record, however, the Guatemalan government\n\nhas been acting to stem the tide of violence against women.                Our\n\nsympathies cannot substitute for the \"specific grounds required by\n\nthe statute.\"        Caal-Tiul, 582 F.2d at 95.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n               For   the   reasons   provided   above,   the   petitions   are\n\ndismissed in part and are otherwise denied.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Both petitioners advance an unexhausted challenge to the\nBIA's requirement that a particular social group be socially\nvisible. We cannot entertain such an unexhausted challenge, see\nSunoto v. Gonzales, 504 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f",

In\n\naddition to each petitioner's claims based on asserted group\n\nmembership, the petitioners also claimed that Perez's resistance to\n\ngang recruitment qualified as \"political opinion\" for which they\n\nfaced persecution.\n\n               An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied their applications,\n\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the denials.\n\nThe Board's rationale was the same in both cases:           the petitioners\n\nhad failed to identify a protected ground on which to base their\n\nwithholding of removal claims.          The BIA concluded that the social\n\ngroups    in    which   the   petitioners    claimed   membership   were   not\n\ncognizable \"particular social group[s]\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute.       The Board further concluded that Perez's resistance to\n\ngang recruitment, standing alone, did not qualify as a \"political\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fopinion\" and that the gangs did not impute a political opinion to\n\nhis spouse based on this resistance.\n\n             Perez and Boj individually petitioned for judicial review\n\nof the BIA's orders.           We deny the petitions, except for an\n\nunexhausted claim which we dismiss.\n\n                                     I.    Facts\n\n             The facts presented here are undisputed.             Both Perez and\n\nBoj   were   born   in   a   small    Guatemalan      village    to   families   of\n\nindigenous Mayan Quiche ancestry.               They married at a young age.     At\n\nsome point, Perez began a construction job in Guatemala City,\n\nreturning to his village and family on weekends.                      While he was\n\nworking at this job, members from a gang -- the \"Maras\" --\n\napproached him and attempted to recruit him.                    Perez refused to\n\njoin, testifying later that he was opposed to the gang's practices\n\nand values.     His refusal to join resulted in the gang demanding\n\nhalf of his weekly salary as \"penitence.\"                Perez paid this money,\n\nfearing that if he did not pay, the gang would harm him or his\n\nfamily as it had others who refused to make payments.\n\n             Perez paid this money for approximately five years.                 In\n\n2000, however, tired of paying the gang, Perez decided to leave for\n\nthe United States.       Because he could not afford to bring his wife\n\nand two children with him, Perez planned to send for them when he\n\nhad earned enough money.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f             When the extorted payments ceased, the gang sent one of\n\nits members, Mauricio Ismael, to harass Boj.                Ismael raped Boj\n\nrepeatedly over the course of three months. Boj became pregnant as\n\na result but miscarried after being beaten by Ismael.                Boj never\n\nreported these crimes to the government in Guatemala, because, she\n\ntestified, of her belief that the government ignores complaints\n\nfrom indigenous women.\n\n             Eventually, Perez sent money to Boj so that she and their\n\nchildren could join him in the United States.              After her arrival,\n\nBoj   was   treated    for   mental   health    problems   arising   from   her\n\nexperiences in Guatemala.\n\n             In support of their requests for withholding of removal,\n\nPerez and Boj submitted documentary evidence of country conditions\n\nin Guatemala, including a U.S. Department of State Country Report\n\nfor 2006.      This evidence revealed that \"societal violence [in\n\nGuatemala] was widespread\" with non-state actors (including gangs)\n\ncommitting \"hundreds of killings and other crimes.\"                  The gangs\n\npreyed on women in particular, with authorities attributing to\n\ngangs many of the gender-based crimes, including sexual assault and\n\nmurder.     The evidence also indicated, however, that the Guatemalan\n\ngovernment had made efforts to combat the gang menace.                  A 2005\n\nreport      stated    that   Guatemala's       president    supported    \"both\n\nstrengthening law enforcement capacity to combat criminal gangs,\n\nand expanding gang prevention and social rehabilitation programs.\"\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fIt also noted that the \"Guatemalan Congress is considering tough\n\nanti-gang legislation that would try gang members ages 12 and older\n\nas adults, and establish lengthy sentences for gang leaders.\"\n\n          As stated, the IJ rejected the petitioners' withholding\n\nclaims, and the BIA affirmed.\n\n                              II.

Withholding of removal\n\n              To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must\n\nprove that, if she is repatriated, it is more likely than not that\n\nshe will be persecuted on account of one of five protected grounds:\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup or political opinion.

Perez\n\n              Perez claimed that he was persecuted and would face\n\nfuture persecution if returned to Guatemala due to his social group\n\nmembership and because of his political opinions regarding gangs.\n\nWe address these contentions in turn.\n\n              a. Particular social groups\n\n              The record reflects that the only social group membership\n\nassessed by the IJ was \"Guatemalans returning from the United\n\nStates\" who, according to Perez's testimony, would be harmed by\n\ngangs because they would be perceived to have money or valuable\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fgoods.       In addition, the BIA interpreted Perez's petition as\n\nalleging that he was a member of a group of \"young indigenous\n\nGuatemalan males who expressly oppose the practices and values of\n\nthe MS gang and wish to protect their families against such\n\npractices.\"\n\n              On appeal, however, Perez pursues a slightly different\n\ntack. To begin with, he does not address the \"returning expatriate\n\nfrom the United States\" claim in his brief. That argument is\n\ntherefore waived.      Le Bin Zhu v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"177229\"><a href=\"/opinion/177229/le-bin-zhu-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).1      Next, in addition to membership in the gang-opposition\n\ngroup, he also claims on appeal membership in a particular social\n\ngroup as the husband of a rural, indigenous woman whose family has\n\nopposed gang members.     As this claim was not presented to the IJ or\n\nBIA,       we do not have jurisdiction to review it.   See 8 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1252(d)(1); Ahmed v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150524\"><a href=\"/opinion/150524/ahmed-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(\"[A]rguments not made before the BIA may not make their debut in\n\na petition for judicial review . . . .\").\n\n              Turning to the claim properly before us, the BIA found\n\nthat Perez's gang opposition did not make him part of a social\n\n\n       1\n      Even if we were to consider this claim, the Board's\nconclusion that gang members target anyone they believe can provide\nthem with money or valuables is well-supported by the record. As\nsuch, its conclusion that Perez would not be targeted \"on account\nof\" his membership in a group is unassailable. See Caal-Tiul v.\nHolder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203999\"><a href=\"/opinion/203999/caal-tiul-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"[S]ome social, gender,\nand economic groupings are almost always more vulnerable to crime\nand predation.

The Board relied on its\n\ndecision in Matter of S-E-G, et al., 24 I. & N. Dec. 579 (BIA\n\n2008), in which the Board held that Salvadoran youths who resisted\n\ngang recruitment do not constitute a particular social group.                  We\n\nfind       no   error   in   applying   controlling   BIA    case   law   to   the\n\nGuatemalan petitioner.           See Larios v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149042\"><a href=\"/opinion/149042/larios-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 2010) (approving BIA application of Matter of S-E-G to\n\nGuatemalan petitioner claiming membership in group of Guatemalan\n\ngang resistors).2\n\n                b.   Political opinion\n\n                Perez's withholding of removal claim premised on his\n\nalleged political opinions fares no better.                 The BIA concluded,\n\nbased on its decision in Matter of E-A-G, 24 I. & N. Dec. 591 (BIA\n\n2008), that Perez's refusal to join a gang, without more, did not\n\nqualify as the expression of a political opinion.              This conclusion\n\nis supportable. In addition to the Board's own precedent, to which\n\nwe owe some deference, see Larios, 608 F.3d at 107, the Supreme\n\n\n       2\n      In July 2009, a few months after the BIA decision in this\nmatter, the BIA in Matter of S-E-G granted the parties' joint\nmotion to reopen and remand the matter so that the IJ could\nadministratively close the proceedings. The petitioners suggest\nthat this undermines the BIA's reliance on Matter of S-E-G, but\nthey have provided us with no indication that the BIA has\nreconsidered the precedential value of Matter of S-E-G. Moreover,\nin addition to our decision in Larios, several other circuits have\ncontinued to apply Matter of S-E-G to factual scenarios similar to\nthose presented in this case. See, e.g., Lizama v. Holder, No. 09-\n2027, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">149874</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6 (4th Cir.

Holder, 380 Fed. Appx. 41, 43 (2nd Cir. 2010).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCourt's opinion in INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), is\n\non point.    In that case, the Court explained that a petitioner's\n\nresistance to recruitment into a guerilla movement, without more,\n\ndid not qualify as the expression of a political opinion.      Id. at\n\n481-82.   So it is here.   Nothing in the record suggests that Perez\n\noutwardly expressed any anti-gang message or that his resistance to\n\nthe gang was politically motivated.    The petitioner's reliance on\n\nhis mere resistance thus falls short.\n\n2. Boj\n\n            Boj also seeks withholding of removal due to persecution\n\non account of her membership in certain social groups and her\n\npolitical views.    We address the two categories seriatim.\n\n            a. Social groups\n\n            Boj claims that she suffered past persecution and will\n\nlikely suffer persecution upon her return to Guatemala due to her\n\nmembership in two particular social groups:     1) young Guatemalan\n\nindigenous females whose family members have expressly opposed gang\n\npractices and values; and 2) young indigenous Guatemalan women who\n\nare not protected from gangs by Guatemalan authorities.3\n\n            As to the first putative group, the BIA used the same\n\nreasoning that it did in rejecting Perez's claim:   that resistance\n\nto gang entreaties does not constitute a social group.        For the\n\n\n     3\n      The BIA addressed a \"returning expatriate\" claim similar to\nPerez's.   As that issue has not been raised on appeal, it is\nwaived.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fsame reasons set forth in our discussion of Perez's claim, we\n\ndecline to disturb the BIA's conclusion.               The BIA approached the\n\nsecond alleged group differently.               Without necessarily deciding\n\nwhether the stated categories of females qualified as a particular\n\nsocial group, the Board concluded that Boj had failed to show that\n\nthe   claimed    persecution      was     \"on    account\"    of   that   group's\n\ncharacteristics.     We agree.\n\n            To make out a successful withholding of removal claim,\n\nBoj must satisfy a nexus requirement, that is, she needs to\n\nestablish that the persecution feared will be on account of a\n\nprotected ground.        Sompotan v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203395\"><a href=\"/opinion/203395/sompotan-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     The BIA determined that Boj had failed to establish that\n\nthe gang members harmed her because of her status as a Guatemalan\n\nindigenous female.         This conclusion is fully supported by the\n\nrecord.    The testimony of the petitioners indicates that the gang\n\nmembers targeted Boj because her husband stopped making extortion\n\npayments    to   them,    not   because   she    was   an   indigenous   female.\n\nAccordingly, the BIA's decision stands.\n\n            b. Political opinion\n\n            For her part, Boj claims that gang members imputed an\n\nanti-gang political opinion to her when her husband refused to join\n\nthem and stopped paying them money.             Although an imputed political\n\nopinion may form the basis for a withholding claim, Vasquez v. INS,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198481\"><a href=\"/opinion/198481/vasquez-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir. 1999), nothing in the record indicates\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthat the gang members imputed an anti-gang political opinion to\n\nBoj.       And, as noted, nothing about Perez's resistance to the gang\n\nwould lead the gang's members to attribute a political opinion to\n\nhim or to his wife.        The BIA's decision on this issue easily clears\n\nthe \"substantial evidence\" hurdle.4\n\n               As a coda to Boj's claim, our decision here is not in any\n\nway an attempt to downplay the horrors that she endured. According\n\nto the reports in the record, however, the Guatemalan government\n\nhas been acting to stem the tide of violence against women.                Our\n\nsympathies cannot substitute for the \"specific grounds required by\n\nthe statute.\"        Caal-Tiul, 582 F.2d at 95.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n               For   the   reasons   provided   above,   the   petitions   are\n\ndismissed in part and are otherwise denied.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Both petitioners advance an unexhausted challenge to the\nBIA's requirement that a particular social group be socially\nvisible. We cannot entertain such an unexhausted challenge, see\nSunoto v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203032\"><a href=\"/opinion/203032/sunoto-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f</pre>",
