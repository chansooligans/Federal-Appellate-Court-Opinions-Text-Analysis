This  appeal  tests  the\n                                    \n\napplicability of a  one year limitation provision  in a passenger\n\ncruise  ticket to an injury suffered by a passenger while ashore,\n\non  hotel property  owned  by the  same  entity which  owned  and\n\noperated the cruise vessel.\n\n     In the  spring of 1990, plaintiffs, Marian and Leonard Rams,\n\nresidents of Massachusetts, embarked  on a Caribbean cruise  on a\n\nship  owned by defendant,  Royal Caribbean Cruise  Lines, Ltd., a\n\nFlorida  corporation.   On  April  6,  1990,  while  on  a  shore\n\nexcursion in Haiti at  a tourist resort owned by  defendant, Mrs.\n\nRams fell on a  walkway, sustaining injuries.  A little  over two\n\nyears  later,  both  Rams  filed suit,  alleging  that  defendant\n\n\"negligently maintained a  defective and dangerous  condition\" on\n\nthe walkway, and seeking damages  for personal injuries and  loss\n\nof consortium.  \n\n     On  the  strength of  an affidavit  containing  a copy  of a\n\nticket contract identical to  that given to plaintiffs, defendant\n\nmoved for summary judgment,  asserting that plaintiffs had failed\n\nto  institute  suit within  the one  year  period allowed  by the\n\ncontract.1   The Rams argued that their  claim was not covered by\n\n                    \n\n     1The contract provides, in relevant part:\n          In  no  event shall  the  Carrier  be  liable  for  any\n\n     accident or harm to the Passenger which occurs off the\n     Vessel itself.\n          . . . \n          NO SUIT  SHALL BE  MAINTAINABLE AGAINST THE  CARRIER OR\n     VESSEL FOR  DELAY,  DETENTION, PERSONAL  INJURY, ILLNESS  OR\n     DEATH  OF THE PASSENGER UNLESS WRITTEN  NOTICE OF THE CLAIM,\n     WITH  FULL PARTICULARS, SHALL BE DELIVERED TO THE CARRIER OR\n     ITS AGENT AT  ITS OFFICE AT  THE PORT OF  SAILING OR AT  THE\n\n                               -3-\n\nthis time limitation, and urged the court to apply the three year\n\nstatute of limitations for tort actions provided by Massachusetts\n\nlaw, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 260   2A (1992).\n\n     The  district court engaged in  a maritime tort law analysis\n\nand,  apparently on the  assumption that the  complaint alleged a\n\nfailure  to  warn,  concluded  that  a  carrier's  duty  to  warn\n\npassengers  of  on-shore hazards  was  so  intimately related  to\n\ntraditional carrier-passenger relationships that the tort in this\n\ncase  was maritime in nature even though occurring at the resort.\n\nIt  then  disavowed part  of  the ticket  contract  exempting the\n\ncarrier  for  liability for  off-the-ship  injuries  as being  in\n\ncontravention of public policy; noted that the ticket's  one year\n\nlimitation  provision complied with governing  law, as it met the\n\nstatutory requirement of 46 U.S.C.   183b(a)  (making it unlawful\n\nfor owners of passenger-transport  ships to provide a statute  of\n\nlimitations  of less than one  year for institution  of suits for\n\nloss   of   life  or   bodily   injury),   and  the   \"reasonable\n\ncommunicativeness\" standard  applicable to contracts  of passage,\n\nsee,  e.g., Lousararian v. Royal Caribbean Corp., 951 F.2d 7, 8-9\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir.  1991); and applied  the limitation provision  to grant\n\nsummary judgment for defendant.\n\n                    \n\n     PORT  OF TERMINATION WITHIN SIX (6) MONTHS FROM THE DAY WHEN\n     SUCH DELAY, DETENTION, PERSONAL  INJURY, ILLNESS OR DEATH OF\n     THE PASSENGER OCCURRED AND  IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY  SUCH SUIT\n     FOR  ANY CAUSE  AGAINST  THE CARRIER  OR  VESSEL FOR  DELAY,\n     DETENTION, PERSONAL INJURY, ILLNESS OR DEATH BE MAINTAINABLE\n     UNLESS SUCH SUIT SHALL BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR FROM\n     THE DAY WHEN THE  DELAY, DETENTION, PERSONAL INJURY, ILLNESS\n     OR  DEATH OF  THE  PASSENGER OCCURRED,  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY\n     PROVISION OF LAW OF ANY STATE OR COUNTRY TO THE CONTRARY.\n\n                               -4-\n\n     Our own view is that this case does not require  us to delve\n\ninto either  the locality  or nexus  requirements for  a maritime\n\ntort under  Executive Jet Aviation,  Inc. v. Cleveland,  409 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n249 (1972).  We view this as a straightforward contract case.  To\n\nillustrate why  we think maritime tort  considerations merely fog\n\nthe  issue, we hypothesize the  following: if the  ticket in this\n\ncase  had explicitly set forth  a one year  limitation period for\n\nany personal injury claims, whether the injuries were suffered on\n\nship  or shore,  we  strongly suspect  that  this suit  would  be\n\nbarred,  whether or not the tort were maritime in nature, because\n\nsuch  a  provision would  meet  the  threshold one  year  minimum\n\nrequirement of 46 U.S.C.   183b(a). \n\n      The  salient   question  in  our  minds   is  whether  this\n\nparticular  ticket  contract  limitations  provision  applies  to\n\nclaims based  on injuries suffered  on shore after  the passenger\n\nclearly  has left the ship.  The  contract in this case being one\n\nfor \"transportation of the plaintiff,\" it is a maritime contract.\n\nThe Moses  Taylor, 71  U.S. 411,  427 (1866); see  also Hodes  v.\n                                                             \n\nS.N.C.  Achille Lauro  ed Altri-Gestione, 858  F.2d 905,  909 (3d\n                                        \n\nCir. 1988).   We see, however, nothing in this fact to change the\n\nordinary strictures  governing our plenary review  of the meaning\n\nof a written contract,  including the principle that \"in  case of\n\ndoubt, an instrument  is to be taken against  the party that drew\n\nit.\"  Chelsea Industries, Inc. v. Accuray Leasing Corp., 699 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n58,  61 (1st  Cir. 1983).   On  the contrary,  if there  were any\n\ndifference  in  approach  between  maritime and  common  law,  we\n\n                               -5-\n\nsuspect  that the  former would  be more  solicitous of  those in\n\nplaintiffs' position.   Cf. Moragne  v. States Marine  Lines, 398\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 375, 387 (1970).\n\n     Our inquiry into intent  and ambiguity yields the following.\n\nThe  ticket  booklet given  plaintiffs  bears  the cover  caption\n\n\"Passenger  Ticket  CONTRACT.\"    The term  \"passenger\"  is  then\n\ndefined  as \"all persons travelling under this ticket.\"  The word\n\n\"carrier\"  is defined as  \"Royal Caribbean Cruises  Ltd.2 and all\n\nVessels  either  chartered,  operated,  or  controlled  by  Royal\n\nCaribbean Cruises Ltd.\"  Subsequent  provisions exclude liability\n\nof the carrier \"for  any accident or harm to the  Passenger which\n\noccurs off the vessel itself\" or \"occurring onshore\"  and specify\n\nthat  \"[s]hore excursions are operated by independent contractors\n\nand the Carrier shall not be responsible . . . for . . . injury .\n\n.  .  arising out  of any  service  provided by  such independent\n\ncontractors.\"\n\n     These  provisions  are followed  by the  limitations clause,\n\nwhich  states,  in  bold  letters,   that  \"[n]o  suit  shall  be\n\nmaintainable against the  carrier or  vessel for .  . .  personal\n\ninjury .  . .  of the passenger  unless written  notice . .  . is\n\ndelivered to  the carrier .  . . within  six (6) months  from the\n\n[date of personal  injury] . . .  and in no event  shall any such\n\n                    \n\n     2The name  of the defendant appearing in  all the pleadings,\nmotions, memoranda  of law,  and the  district  court opinion  is\n\"Royal Caribbean  Cruise Lines, Ltd.\" or  \"Royal Caribbean Cruise\nLines,  Inc.\"   In the  ticket contract,  however, it  appears as\n\"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\"  There has been no explanation for\nthis  discrepancy.   We  do  not  suggest  that  this  has  legal\nconsequences, in light of our conclusion.\n\n                               -6-\n\nsuit . . .  be maintainable unless  such suit shall be  commenced\n\nwithin one (1) year from the day when the . . . personal injury .\n\n. . occurred . . . .\"   \n\n     Reading the  contract  as  a whole,  we  conclude  that  its\n\nreasonable  intendment is to  refer to  claims of  passengers for\n\ninjuries while  on board ship.   Not only does  the definition of\n\npassenger as one \"travelling under this ticket\" smell of the sea,\n\nbut this  interpretation is  strongly reinforced by  the explicit\n\navoidance of liability for injuries sustained on shore.  There is\n\neven the added statement  that shore excursions are in  the hands\n\nof independent contractors  for whose actions the  carrier has no\n\nliability.   Finally, the definition  of carrier refers  to Royal\n\nCaribbean  Cruises Ltd.  \"and all vessels  . .  . owned\"   by it.\n\nThere is no mention of \"hotels or resorts\" owned by it.  As Judge\n\nAldrich wrote for our court in Chelsea Industries, \"He who speaks\n                                                 \n\nshould speak  plainly or the other  party may explain to  his own\n\nadvantage.\"   699  F.2d at  61 (quoting  Opportunity Consultants,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v. Tugrul, 354 N.E.2d 698, 699 (Ohio 1976)).\n              \n\n     Although  we believe  that the above  reading of  the ticket\n\ncontract  is  correct,  we  have absolutely  no  doubt  that  the\n\ncontract is at  the very  least ambiguous and  that therefore  it\n\nmust  be construed against the  defendant.  Finally,  even if the\n\nrelevant provisions were to escape the meaning we ascribe to them\n\nand to hurdle the  obstacle of ambiguity, they would fail to meet\n\nour  standard of \"reasonable  communicativeness\" under such cases\n\nas  Lousararian.   We  could not  say,  for example,  that  after\n               \n\n                               -7-\n\nexamining \"the facial  clarity of the  ticket contract\" that  the\n\n\"language   and   appearance   make   the   relevant   provisions\n\nsufficiently obvious and understandable.\"  Id. at 8.\n                                              \n\n     The grant of  summary judgment for defendant is reversed and\n                                                                 \n\nthe  case  is  remanded  to   the  district  court  for   further\n                                                                 \n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                         \n\n                               -8-\n",

L. ch. 260   2A (1992).\n\n     The  district court engaged in  a maritime tort law analysis\n\nand,  apparently on the  assumption that the  complaint alleged a\n\nfailure  to  warn,  concluded  that  a  carrier's  duty  to  warn\n\npassengers  of  on-shore hazards  was  so  intimately related  to\n\ntraditional carrier-passenger relationships that the tort in this\n\ncase  was maritime in nature even though occurring at the resort.\n\nIt  then  disavowed part  of  the ticket  contract  exempting the\n\ncarrier  for  liability for  off-the-ship  injuries  as being  in\n\ncontravention of public policy; noted that the ticket's  one year\n\nlimitation  provision complied with governing  law, as it met the\n\nstatutory requirement of 46 U.S.C.   183b(a)  (making it unlawful\n\nfor owners of passenger-transport  ships to provide a statute  of\n\nlimitations  of less than one  year for institution  of suits for\n\nloss   of   life  or   bodily   injury),   and  the   \"reasonable\n\ncommunicativeness\" standard  applicable to contracts  of passage,\n\nsee,  e.g., Lousararian v.

We view this as a straightforward contract case.  To\n\nillustrate why  we think maritime tort  considerations merely fog\n\nthe  issue, we hypothesize the  following: if the  ticket in this\n\ncase  had explicitly set forth  a one year  limitation period for\n\nany personal injury claims, whether the injuries were suffered on\n\nship  or shore,  we  strongly suspect  that  this suit  would  be\n\nbarred,  whether or not the tort were maritime in nature, because\n\nsuch  a  provision would  meet  the  threshold one  year  minimum\n\nrequirement of 46 U.S.C.   183b(a). \n\n      The  salient   question  in  our  minds   is  whether  this\n\nparticular  ticket  contract  limitations  provision  applies  to\n\nclaims based  on injuries suffered  on shore after  the passenger\n\nclearly  has left the ship.  The  contract in this case being one\n\nfor \"transportation of the plaintiff,\" it is a maritime contract.\n\nThe Moses  Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  427 (1866); see  also Hodes  v.\n                                                             \n\nS.N.C.

We  do  not  suggest  that  this  has  legal\nconsequences, in light of our conclusion.\n\n                               -6-\n\nsuit . . .  be maintainable unless  such suit shall be  commenced\n\nwithin one (1) year from the day when the . . . personal injury .\n\n. . occurred . . . .\"   \n\n     Reading the  contract  as  a whole,  we  conclude  that  its\n\nreasonable  intendment is to  refer to  claims of  passengers for\n\ninjuries while  on board ship.   Not only does  the definition of\n\npassenger as one \"travelling under this ticket\" smell of the sea,\n\nbut this  interpretation is  strongly reinforced by  the explicit\n\navoidance of liability for injuries sustained on shore.  There is\n\neven the added statement  that shore excursions are in  the hands\n\nof independent contractors  for whose actions the  carrier has no\n\nliability.   Finally, the definition  of carrier refers  to Royal\n\nCaribbean  Cruises Ltd.  \"and all vessels  . .  . owned\"   by it.\n\nThere is no mention of \"hotels or resorts\" owned by it.  As Judge\n\nAldrich wrote for our court in Chelsea Industries, \"He who speaks\n                                                 \n\nshould speak  plainly or the other  party may explain to  his own\n\nadvantage.\"   699  F.2d at  61 (quoting  Opportunity Consultants,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v.

Finally,  even if the\n\nrelevant provisions were to escape the meaning we ascribe to them\n\nand to hurdle the  obstacle of ambiguity, they would fail to meet\n\nour  standard of \"reasonable  communicativeness\" under such cases\n\nas  Lousararian.
