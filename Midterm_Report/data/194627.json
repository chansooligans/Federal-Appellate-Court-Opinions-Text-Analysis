In the district court, Alexander\n                          \n\nLopez  was convicted  of  possessing cocaine  with intent  to\n\ndistribute and  with conspiracy  to commit the  same offense.\n\n21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 846.   The  jury deadlocked  on two\n\nother counts, later dismissed, charging Lopez with possessing\n\na  short barrel shotgun and with its use in drug dealing.  26\n\nU.S.C.   5861(d);  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1).   On this  appeal,\n\nLopez contests only the  district court's refusal to suppress\n\nevidence obtained at the time of his arrest.  We affirm.\n\n     The pertinent facts, developed mainly at the suppression\n\nhearing, can be briefly stated.  Early on the morning of June\n\n22,  1991, Charles Perry, a long-time cocaine user, went to a\n\nbuilding in  Providence, Rhode  Island, to  purchase cocaine.\n\nThe building was a decrepit  three-story tenement and, on the\n\nsecond floor, there was a kitchen, an adjoining bathroom, and\n\nthree adjoining bedrooms available for rent on a weekly basis\n\nto  tenants,  who  were  expected to  share  the  kitchen and\n\nbathroom.  On the morning of June 22, one bedroom, previously\n\nused  by  prostitutes,  was  empty;  one was  occupied  by  a\n\nrespectable tenant away at work;  and the last was used by  a\n\ncocaine dealer named Blackie for whom Lopez worked.\n\n     Arriving at  the second floor by the  back stairs, Perry\n\nfound the door to the kitchen open and entered  to find Lopez\n\nand another  man.  Perry bought  a small bag  of cocaine from\n\nLopez and left to  inject the cocaine.  Several  hours later,\n\n                             -2-\n\nPerry returned.  Finding the second floor door now closed, he\n\nnegotiated  a  sale  from  the  outside,  took  his  purchase\n\ndownstairs  and  found  that   he  had  bought  baking  soda.\n\nReturning to the  second floor,  he pounded on  the door  and\n\nyelled   until  admitted.     There   he  found   Lopez,  the\n\nunidentified  man present  on his  first visit,  and Blackie.\n\nWhen Perry began to yell, Blackie leveled a sawed-off double-\n\nbarrel shotgun at Perry and told him to leave.\n\n     Retreating to the yard outside, Perry continued to yell.\n\nBlackie left, threatening Perry as he did so.  Perry then had\n\nsomeone call  the  police  to  report  that  Perry  had  been\n\nthreatened with a sawed-off shotgun.   Lopez emerged and gave\n\nPerry  a packet  of cocaine.   Police  cars, responding  to a\n\nradio  alert, began  to arrive.   Pointing  to the  building,\n\nPerry then described to several officers a male wearing green\n\ncamouflage trousers and no shirt.  Officer Tombs, who arrived\n\nseparately, heard  the description and saw  Lopez standing in\n\nthe  yard behind  the building,  without a shirt  and wearing\n\ngreen camouflage pants, apparently holding an object.\n\n          Tombs, clad  in uniform,  called on Lopez  to halt.\n\nInstead, Lopez dashed into the building and ran to the second\n\nfloor.   Tombs pursued, broke through  two intervening doors,\n\nand  arrested  Lopez  in  the   little  bedroom.    As  Tombs\n\nhandcuffed  Lopez, a radio fell over, and six tiny baggies of\n\ncocaine were disclosed.   Other officers  appeared, including\n\n                             -3-\n\nOfficer  Vanderhorst, and  a search  for the  shotgun ensued.\n\nVanderhorst,  entering  the  bathroom,  saw  a  ceiling  tile\n\nmissing.   He stood on the  toilet, peered in, and  saw a big\n\nbag,  which proved  to have smaller  bags of  cocaine inside.\n\nThen,  looking in again,  he saw a  gun butt.   As he climbed\n\ndown,  possibly using  a  ceiling panel  as a  hand-hold, the\n\nceiling collapsed  and spilled  a sawed-off shotgun  onto the\n\nfloor.  From handcuffing  to discovery of the gun, only a few\n\nminutes passed.\n\n     After a  suppression hearing before  trial, the district\n\ncourt refused to suppress the shotgun or the cocaine found in\n\nthe  bedroom  and the  bathroom.   The  court found  that the\n\narrest leading to the discovery of cocaine in the bedroom was\n\nbased upon probable cause  and that Lopez had no  standing to\n\nobject  to  the search  of  the bathroom.    On the  issue of\n\nstanding, the court  found that the bathroom was available to\n\nanyone on the premises, had  no outside lock, and  engendered\n\nno expectation  of privacy.   The  cocaine  and shotgun  were\n\noffered as evidence  at trial.   Lopez was  convicted on  the\n\ncocaine counts.\n\n     On this appeal, Lopez argues  that as an authorized user\n\nof the apartment, he  had standing to object to  the bathroom\n\nsearch under  United States  v. Irizarry,  673 F.2d  554 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1982).   In turn,  the government  defends the  district\n\ncourt's suppression  ruling  primarily  by  arguing  lack  of\n\n                             -4-\n\nstanding, citing United States v. Thornley, 707 F.2d 622 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1983).   As a second  string to its  bow, the government\n\nargues that  exigent circumstances justified  the search  for\n\nthe  shotgun  without  awaiting  a  warrant.    We  think the\n\nstanding  issue  a close  call and  prefer  to affirm  on the\n\nmerits of the Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n     It is  common ground  that the Fourth  Amendment forbids\n\nonly  unreasonable  searches and  seizures;  that  normally a\n\nsearch is unreasonable absent  a warrant issued by a  neutral\n\nmagistrate  upon  a showing  of probable  cause; and  that to\n\nexcuse  the lack  of a  warrant,  the police  must ordinarily\n\nbring the case within one or  more of a list of exceptions to\n\nthe  warrant  requirement.   See  generally  Coolidge v.  New\n                                                             \n\nHampshire,  403  U.S.  443, 477-78  (1971).    A  few of  the\n         \n\nexceptions are  huge, such as  arrest for  felony and  search\n\nincident  to  arrest,  which  embrace Lopez'  arrest  in  the\n\nbedroom--assuming probable  cause to pursue him  in the first\n\nplace.   Most  of the  exceptions, however, are  narrower and\n\nmore complex.  \n\n     The exception with  which we are concerned in  this case\n\nexcuses the  lack of a warrant  where \"exigent circumstances\"\n\nexist,   requiring  speed   and  making   delay  improvident.\n\nAlthough   the  most  frequent   example  is  the  threatened\n\ndestruction of evidence, e.g., Cupp v. Murphy, 412  U.S. 291,\n                                             \n\n294-96  (1973),  a   solid  line  of  cases    finds  exigent\n\n                             -5-\n\ncircumstances where the safety of law enforcement officers or\n\nthe  general public is  threatened.  E.g.,  Warden v. Hayden,\n                                                            \n\n387 U.S.  294, 298-99 (1967); Criminal  Procedure Project, 80\n                                                         \n\nGeo. L.J. 939, 987 (1992) (collecting numerous cases).   This\n\ncircuit has so  held.   E.g., United States  v. Rengifo,  858\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  800, 805 (1st Cir.  1988), cert. denied,  490 U.S. 1023\n                                             \n\n(1989).\n\n     The  question here, then,  is whether  the police  had a\n\nreasonable basis to believe  that a threat to safety  existed\n\nof an urgency and magnitude that  would justify a warrantless\n\nsearch  of the kind that  occurred.  In  truth, two different\n\nissues  are  embraced in  this formula.    One is  the police\n\nperception  of danger,  judged by what  the officers  saw and\n\nknew at the time.   The other, a legal issue for  the courts,\n\nis whether  under the  Fourth Amendment the  perceived threat\n\njustified their behavior.   In this  case, what the  officers\n\nsaw and knew is largely apparent from the record.  By a close\n\nmargin, we think their perception justified their conduct.\n\n     The most important element is that the police had reason\n\nto believe that  Lopez had a sawed-off shotgun  nearby, which\n\nhad  been used only shortly  before to threaten  Perry.  That\n\nBlackie had  done the threatening, not  Lopez, was apparently\n\nunknown to the  officers; if  they had known,  it could  only\n\nhave  increased  their concern  since  Blackie  was still  at\n\nlarge.  Thus, the  police had ample basis for  believing that\n\n                             -6-\n\nan extremely dangerous  weapon was lodged  close at hand  and\n\nshould be recovered as promptly as possible.\n\n     It  is  hard  to  think  that  Lopez  himself  posed  an\n\nimmediate danger.   Although one in  custody may yet  present\n\nrisks, it  appears that Lopez  was handcuffed in  the bedroom\n\nand  that other officers were there  when the bathroom search\n\noccurred.   Still, the police had no assurance that Lopez was\n\nacting alone (in fact, he was not), or that the apartment was\n\nsecure  (there  were actually  two  entrances  on the  second\n\nfloor).  Officer  Tombs thought that  others might have  been\n\nwith Lopez in  the second  floor apartment.1   The nature  of\n\nthe  building--a  dilapidated,  multi-tenant  structure--lent\n\nfurther weight to a reasonable concern that the shotgun might\n\nbe hidden nearby, recovered by others, and used again.\n\n     The nature of the search is also important.  This is not\n\nbecause  Lopez lacked \"standing\" as  to the bathroom area (we\n\nassume arguendo that he had standing), but because the degree\n               \n\nof  intrusion has  a  bearing on  the  reasonableness of  the\n\npolice action.   It is one  thing to break into  and search a\n\nfamily home, another to frisk an arrested suspect, another to\n\nsearch a car, and  yet another to make a  protective sweep of\n\n                    \n\n     1Tombs testified at the suppression hearing that when he\nreached  the  second floor  in  pursuit  of Lopez,  he  heard\nwithin:    \"Footsteps, fast  moving  footsteps.   I  couldn't\ndetermine how many people, how many, you know,  subjects were\nin  the house.   But  there was  footsteps running  about the\nhouse, inside the door.\"\n\n                             -7-\n\nan already entered  building to uncover  other suspects.   In\n\neach  such  case,  the  extent  of  the  intrusion,  and  the\n\nproportionality   of    response   to   need,    inform   the\n\nconstitutional judgment.\n\n     Here, the  intrusion, although not minimal, was limited:\n\nthe  officer saw the opening in  the bathroom ceiling through\n\nan  open door, entered the empty room, and with little effort\n\nsaw the  butt of the weapon.   There was no new  entry into a\n\nprivate residence;  the police were lawfully in the kitchen. \n\nAnd  the  search  can be  justified  as  one  not merely  for\n\nevidence or even contraband  but for a dangerous weapon  in a\n\nbuilding where others might gain access to it.  If the weapon\n\nwere not  swiftly recovered, a search for  others outside the\n\nbuilding might  be needed.   Thus,  this was  a proportionate\n\nsearch, limited  in its range,  specific in  its object,  and\n\njustified by exigent circumstances.\n\n     There is considerable case law on exigent  circumstances\n\nbut, as one might expect in this area, the cases are  heavily\n\ndependant on the  facts.   The closest case  in this  circuit\n\nappears to be  Irizarry, upholding a warrantless search  of a\n                       \n\nhotel  room to the extent  needed to assure  that a suspected\n\narmed \"fourth person\"  did not  remain within.   673 F.2d  at\n\n558.   Irizarry, in  which the  fourth person  was reasonably\n               \n\nbelieved to be  hiding in the room, is a  stronger case for a\n\nwarrantless  search, but  other circuits  on facts  closer in\n\n                             -8-\n\nstrength to our  own have  found them strong  enough.   E.g.,\n                                                           \n\nUnited  States v. Queen, 847  F.2d 346, 353  (7th Cir. 1988);\n                       \n\nUnited States  v. McKinney,  477 F.2d  1184, 1186  (D.C. Cir.\n                          \n\n1973).2   We agree, cautioning  that our own  facts may press\n\nclose to the outer limit of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n     Lopez'  other  challenge is  to  the  lawfulness of  the\n\noriginal  pursuit,  and  this  claim  can  be  answered  more\n\nswiftly.   If the original entry was unlawful, the seizure of\n\nthe cocaine in the  bedroom might be suppressed as  the fruit\n\nof  the  poisonous tree,  see  generally Wong  Sun  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 371 U.S. 471, 484 (1963), and the ban might extend as\n      \n\nwell (we need not decide the point) to the  evidence found in\n\nthe  bathroom  and  a  volunteered statement  at  the  police\n\nstation.  Lopez  says that the original  pursuit was unlawful\n\nbecause the attempted, and ultimately  successful, seizure of\n\nLopez was not  based on probable cause to believe that he had\n\ncommitted a crime.\n\n     On the  contrary, the police  had a reasonable  basis to\n\nbelieve  that Lopez was the man who  had leveled a shotgun at\n\nPerry, even though in the  event it turned out to be  Blackie\n\nwho  had  held  the  weapon.     Office  Tombs,  arriving  to\n\ninvestigate the crime, heard Perry describe an Hispanic male,\n\n                    \n\n     2McKinney,   peculiarly   on   point,    sustained   the\n              \nwarrantless search  of a  hotel room--while the  occupant was\nout--after  a bellman  observed  a sawed-off  shotgun on  the\ntable.\n\n                             -9-\n\nshirtless and in camouflage pants, and saw a man fitting this\n\ndescription  standing near  the building  to which  Perry had\n\npointed.   When  Tombs in  uniform called  on Lopez  to halt,\n\nLopez instead  fled.   These  circumstances including  flight\n\ngave  Tombs reason  to believe  that Lopez  was the  culprit,\n\nUnited  States v.  Vasquez,  534 F.2d  1142, 145  (5th Cir.),\n                          \n\ncert. denied, 429  U.S. 979  (1976), and the  belief in  turn\n            \n\njustified  entry  under  the  \"hot   pursuit\"  doctrine,  see\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  United  States  v.  Santana, 427  U.S.  38,  42-43\n                                      \n\n(1976), and ultimately arrest.\n\n     In sum, the shotgun and cocaine evidence was permissibly\n\nseized  and  introduced  at  trial,  and  the  conviction  is\n\ntherefore valid.   Accordingly, the judgment  of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n                 \n\n                             -10-\n",

The  jury deadlocked  on two\n\nother counts, later dismissed, charging Lopez with possessing\n\na  short barrel shotgun and with its use in drug dealing.  26\n\nU.S.C.   5861(d);  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1).   On this  appeal,\n\nLopez contests only the  district court's refusal to suppress\n\nevidence obtained at the time of his arrest.  We affirm.\n\n     The pertinent facts, developed mainly at the suppression\n\nhearing, can be briefly stated.  Early on the morning of June\n\n22,  1991, Charles Perry, a long-time cocaine user, went to a\n\nbuilding in  Providence, Rhode  Island, to  purchase cocaine.\n\nThe building was a decrepit  three-story tenement and, on the\n\nsecond floor, there was a kitchen, an adjoining bathroom, and\n\nthree adjoining bedrooms available for rent on a weekly basis\n\nto  tenants,  who  were  expected to  share  the  kitchen and\n\nbathroom.  On the morning of June 22, one bedroom, previously\n\nused  by  prostitutes,  was  empty;  one was  occupied  by  a\n\nrespectable tenant away at work;  and the last was used by  a\n\ncocaine dealer named Blackie for whom Lopez worked.\n\n     Arriving at  the second floor by the  back stairs, Perry\n\nfound the door to the kitchen open and entered  to find Lopez\n\nand another  man.  Perry bought  a small bag  of cocaine from\n\nLopez and left to  inject the cocaine.  Several  hours later,\n\n                             -2-\n\nPerry returned.  Finding the second floor door now closed, he\n\nnegotiated  a  sale  from  the  outside,  took  his  purchase\n\ndownstairs  and  found  that   he  had  bought  baking  soda.\n\nReturning to the  second floor,  he pounded on  the door  and\n\nyelled   until  admitted.     There   he  found   Lopez,  the\n\nunidentified  man present  on his  first visit,  and Blackie.\n\nWhen Perry began to yell, Blackie leveled a sawed-off double-\n\nbarrel shotgun at Perry and told him to leave.\n\n     Retreating to the yard outside, Perry continued to yell.\n\nBlackie left, threatening Perry as he did so.  Perry then had\n\nsomeone call  the  police  to  report  that  Perry  had  been\n\nthreatened with a sawed-off shotgun.   Lopez emerged and gave\n\nPerry  a packet  of cocaine.   Police  cars, responding  to a\n\nradio  alert, began  to arrive.   Pointing  to the  building,\n\nPerry then described to several officers a male wearing green\n\ncamouflage trousers and no shirt.  Officer Tombs, who arrived\n\nseparately, heard  the description and saw  Lopez standing in\n\nthe  yard behind  the building,  without a shirt  and wearing\n\ngreen camouflage pants, apparently holding an object.\n\n          Tombs, clad  in uniform,  called on Lopez  to halt.\n\nInstead, Lopez dashed into the building and ran to the second\n\nfloor.   Tombs pursued, broke through  two intervening doors,\n\nand  arrested  Lopez  in  the   little  bedroom.    As  Tombs\n\nhandcuffed  Lopez, a radio fell over, and six tiny baggies of\n\ncocaine were disclosed.   Other officers  appeared, including\n\n                             -3-\n\nOfficer  Vanderhorst, and  a search  for the  shotgun ensued.\n\nVanderhorst,  entering  the  bathroom,  saw  a  ceiling  tile\n\nmissing.   He stood on the  toilet, peered in, and  saw a big\n\nbag,  which proved  to have smaller  bags of  cocaine inside.\n\nThen,  looking in again,  he saw a  gun butt.   As he climbed\n\ndown,  possibly using  a  ceiling panel  as a  hand-hold, the\n\nceiling collapsed  and spilled  a sawed-off shotgun  onto the\n\nfloor.  From handcuffing  to discovery of the gun, only a few\n\nminutes passed.\n\n     After a  suppression hearing before  trial, the district\n\ncourt refused to suppress the shotgun or the cocaine found in\n\nthe  bedroom  and the  bathroom.   The  court found  that the\n\narrest leading to the discovery of cocaine in the bedroom was\n\nbased upon probable cause  and that Lopez had no  standing to\n\nobject  to  the search  of  the bathroom.    On the  issue of\n\nstanding, the court  found that the bathroom was available to\n\nanyone on the premises, had  no outside lock, and  engendered\n\nno expectation  of privacy.   The  cocaine  and shotgun  were\n\noffered as evidence  at trial.   Lopez was  convicted on  the\n\ncocaine counts.\n\n     On this appeal, Lopez argues  that as an authorized user\n\nof the apartment, he  had standing to object to  the bathroom\n\nsearch under  United States  v.

As a second  string to its  bow, the government\n\nargues that  exigent circumstances justified  the search  for\n\nthe  shotgun  without  awaiting  a  warrant.    We  think the\n\nstanding  issue  a close  call and  prefer  to affirm  on the\n\nmerits of the Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n     It is  common ground  that the Fourth  Amendment forbids\n\nonly  unreasonable  searches and  seizures;  that  normally a\n\nsearch is unreasonable absent  a warrant issued by a  neutral\n\nmagistrate  upon  a showing  of probable  cause; and  that to\n\nexcuse  the lack  of a  warrant,  the police  must ordinarily\n\nbring the case within one or  more of a list of exceptions to\n\nthe  warrant  requirement.   See  generally  Coolidge v.  New\n                                                             \n\nHampshire,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108377\"><a href=\"/opinion/108377/coolidge-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477-78  (1971).    A  few of  the\n         \n\nexceptions are  huge, such as  arrest for  felony and  search\n\nincident  to  arrest,  which  embrace Lopez'  arrest  in  the\n\nbedroom--assuming probable  cause to pursue him  in the first\n\nplace.   Most  of the  exceptions, however, are  narrower and\n\nmore complex.  \n\n     The exception with  which we are concerned in  this case\n\nexcuses the  lack of a warrant  where \"exigent circumstances\"\n\nexist,   requiring  speed   and  making   delay  improvident.\n\nAlthough   the  most  frequent   example  is  the  threatened\n\ndestruction of evidence, e.g., Cupp v.

In  truth, two different\n\nissues  are  embraced in  this formula.    One is  the police\n\nperception  of danger,  judged by what  the officers  saw and\n\nknew at the time.   The other, a legal issue for  the courts,\n\nis whether  under the  Fourth Amendment the  perceived threat\n\njustified their behavior.   In this  case, what the  officers\n\nsaw and knew is largely apparent from the record.  By a close\n\nmargin, we think their perception justified their conduct.\n\n     The most important element is that the police had reason\n\nto believe that  Lopez had a sawed-off shotgun  nearby, which\n\nhad  been used only shortly  before to threaten  Perry.  That\n\nBlackie had  done the threatening, not  Lopez, was apparently\n\nunknown to the  officers; if  they had known,  it could  only\n\nhave  increased  their concern  since  Blackie  was still  at\n\nlarge.  Thus, the  police had ample basis for  believing that\n\n                             -6-\n\nan extremely dangerous  weapon was lodged  close at hand  and\n\nshould be recovered as promptly as possible.\n\n     It  is  hard  to  think  that  Lopez  himself  posed  an\n\nimmediate danger.   Although one in  custody may yet  present\n\nrisks, it  appears that Lopez  was handcuffed in  the bedroom\n\nand  that other officers were there  when the bathroom search\n\noccurred.   Still, the police had no assurance that Lopez was\n\nacting alone (in fact, he was not), or that the apartment was\n\nsecure  (there  were actually  two  entrances  on the  second\n\nfloor).  Officer  Tombs thought that  others might have  been\n\nwith Lopez in  the second  floor apartment.1   The nature  of\n\nthe  building--a  dilapidated,  multi-tenant  structure--lent\n\nfurther weight to a reasonable concern that the shotgun might\n\nbe hidden nearby, recovered by others, and used again.\n\n     The nature of the search is also important.  This is not\n\nbecause  Lopez lacked \"standing\" as  to the bathroom area (we\n\nassume arguendo that he had standing), but because the degree\n               \n\nof  intrusion has  a  bearing on  the  reasonableness of  the\n\npolice action.   It is one  thing to break into  and search a\n\nfamily home, another to frisk an arrested suspect, another to\n\nsearch a car, and  yet another to make a  protective sweep of\n\n                    \n\n     1Tombs testified at the suppression hearing that when he\nreached  the  second floor  in  pursuit  of Lopez,  he  heard\nwithin:    \"Footsteps, fast  moving  footsteps.   I  couldn't\ndetermine how many people, how many, you know,  subjects were\nin  the house.   But  there was  footsteps running  about the\nhouse, inside the door.\"\n\n                             -7-\n\nan already entered  building to uncover  other suspects.   In\n\neach  such  case,  the  extent  of  the  intrusion,  and  the\n\nproportionality   of    response   to   need,    inform   the\n\nconstitutional judgment.\n\n     Here, the  intrusion, although not minimal, was limited:\n\nthe  officer saw the opening in  the bathroom ceiling through\n\nan  open door, entered the empty room, and with little effort\n\nsaw the  butt of the weapon.   There was no new  entry into a\n\nprivate residence;  the police were lawfully in the kitchen. \n\nAnd  the  search  can be  justified  as  one  not merely  for\n\nevidence or even contraband  but for a dangerous weapon  in a\n\nbuilding where others might gain access to it.  If the weapon\n\nwere not  swiftly recovered, a search for  others outside the\n\nbuilding might  be needed.   Thus,  this was  a proportionate\n\nsearch, limited  in its range,  specific in  its object,  and\n\njustified by exigent circumstances.\n\n     There is considerable case law on exigent  circumstances\n\nbut, as one might expect in this area, the cases are  heavily\n\ndependant on the  facts.   The closest case  in this  circuit\n\nappears to be  Irizarry, upholding a warrantless search  of a\n                       \n\nhotel  room to the extent  needed to assure  that a suspected\n\narmed \"fourth person\"  did not  remain within.   673 F.2d  at\n\n558.   Irizarry, in  which the  fourth person  was reasonably\n               \n\nbelieved to be  hiding in the room, is a  stronger case for a\n\nwarrantless  search, but  other circuits  on facts  closer in\n\n                             -8-\n\nstrength to our  own have  found them strong  enough.
