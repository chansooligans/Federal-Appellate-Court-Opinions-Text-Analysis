This sentencing appeal presents\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\ntwo  issues for our determination.1  We must consider (1) whether\n\nan attempted escape from state custody prior to the initiation of\n\na federal investigation  into the offense of conviction can serve\n\nas  a  basis  for  enhancing  a  defendant's sentence  under  the\n\nobstruction-of-justice  guideline,  U.S.S.G.     3C1.1;  and  (2)\n\nwhether the facts at  bar justify a substantial  upward departure\n\nfrom  the guideline  sentencing range  (GSR).   Finding  both the\n\nenhancement and the departure to be lawful, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant-appellant  Charles  E.  Emery  met  Thomas H.\n\nSchmoock  when the two men were  serving overlapping sentences at\n\nthe  state  penitentiary  in  Thomaston, Maine.    Appellant  was\n\nreleased in late April of 1991 and Schmoock went free a few weeks\n\nlater.   On May  28, 1991,  the  pair began  executing a  complex\n\ncheck-kiting scheme.  \n\n          In the scheme's preliminary  stage, one of the culprits\n\nposed  as  an agent  of the  Internal  Revenue Service  (IRS) and\n\nsolicited information  from an  unsuspecting dupe, one  Thomas E.\n\nMitchell.   Emery and Schmoock used this information to procure a\n\ncopy  of  Mitchell's  birth  certificate;  they  used  the  birth\n\ncertificate to obtain a  driver's license bearing Mitchell's name\n\nbut Emery's photograph; and they used the license to open several\n\n                    \n\n     1Except where otherwise indicated, all references are to the\nNovember, 1991 edition of the guidelines, which were in effect at\nthe  time of sentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Harotunian,\n                                                                \n920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                2\n\nchecking accounts  in Mitchell's name at  federally insured banks\n\nin Maine and Massachusetts.\n\n          In the scheme's second  phase, Emery deposited a number\n\nof  forged checks drawn on funds of  Lisa and David Holt into the\n\nnewly opened accounts.2 He and Schmoock then  began kiting checks\n\nin escalating  amounts among  the three bogus  Mitchell accounts.\n\nFortunately,  bank officials soon caught  the scent.   On June 6,\n\n1991, officers  of the Sanford, Maine  police department arrested\n\nboth  men.   They promptly  attempted to  escape from  the county\n\njail,  but their escape attempt was no more successful than their\n\ncheck-kiting swindle.  \n\n          Although no  federal investigation had  been mounted to\n\nthis  point, one  followed  shortly.   On  November 21,  1991,  a\n\nfederal  grand  jury  indicted  appellant  on  a  gallimaufry  of\n\ncharges.   He pleaded guilty to impersonation of an IRS agent and\n\nbank  fraud.  See 18 U.S.C.    912,  1344 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990).\n                 \n\nAt sentencing, the court set the base offense level (BOL) at six,\n\nsee U.S.S.G.    2F1.1 (establishing BOL for  bank fraud),3 raised\n   \n\nit seven levels  because of the dollars in issue,  see U.S.S.G.  \n                                                      \n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(H) (providing  for a  seven-level  increase if  fraud\n\ninvolves  $120,000 or  more  but less  than $200,000),  added two\n\nlevels because the crime required more than minimal planning, see\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     2The checks, bearing the imprimatur of a New Hampshire bank,\nwere blank when stolen from the Holts' home several days earlier.\n\n     3Because the  impersonation count carried the  same BOL, see\n                                                                 \nU.S.S.G.     2J1.4,  it  became irrelevant  to  establishing  the\noffense   level  in  this   multiple-count  case.     See  id.   \n                                                              \n2J1.4(c)(1).\n\n                                3\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2)(A), added  two more levels for obstruction\n\nof justice, see U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, and subtracted two  levels for\n               \n\nacceptance of responsibility, see  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  Appellant's\n                                 \n\nadjusted offense level was, therefore, fifteen.  \n\n          Under the guidelines, the GSR is determined by plotting\n\nthe  intersection of two lines:   the adjusted  offense level and\n\nthe  defendant's  criminal history  category (CHC).   The  CHC is\n\nmeasured  in terms of assigned criminal history points; it ranges\n\nfrom I (for a person with fewer than two criminal history points)\n\nto VI (for a person with thirteen points or more).   See U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\nCh.5, Pt.A  (sentencing table).   Appellant sported  an extensive\n\ncriminal history involving an assortment of violent felonies and,\n\nmore  recently,  some less  serious  peccadillos.   His  score of\n\ntwenty  criminal  history  points surpassed  the  thirteen points\n\nneeded to place him in CHC VI.  The GSR was, therefore, forty-one\n\nto  fifty- one  months.   See  id. (offense  level  15; CHC  VI).\n                                  \n\nAbjuring  a sentence within  the GSR the  district judge departed\n\nupward, imposing an incarcerative sentence of seventy-two months.\n\n          In this appeal, appellant bemoans both the obstruction-\n\nof-justice enhancement and the upward departure.  We address each\n\nlamentation in turn.\n\nII.  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\n\n          Appellant does not challenge the factual basis on which\n\nthe  district  court  found  an  obstruction  of  justice     the\n\nprobation officer's report, credited  by the district court, made\n\nmanifest appellant's  attempt to  escape from official  custody  \n\n                                4\n\nbut,  instead,  posits  that   conduct  otherwise  sufficient  to\n\nconstitute an obstruction of justice under the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines   an attempted escape   is inoculated against such use\n\nif  it occurs prior to the initiation of a federal investigation.\n                                                  \n\nThe government  seeks to rebut  this theorem  in three ways.   It\n\navers that the appellant  failed properly to preserve the  point,\n\nthat the decision to  depart rendered the  obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement moot, and that,  in any event, the court  below acted\n\nwithin its  lawful authority  in decreeing  the enhancement.   We\n\nelect to analyze the point in terms of the prosecution's last two\n\nrebuttal arguments.4\n\n                          A.  Mootness.\n                                       \n\n          We reject the government's asseveration that the upward\n\ndeparture  renders the  obstruction-of-justice adjustment  moot. \n\nHad the  district court eschewed the disputed adjustment, the GSR\n\nwould have been thirty-three  to forty-one months.   See U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\nCh.5, Pt.A (sentencing table)  (offense level 13; CHC VI).   When\n\nan adjustment in the offense  level increases the top end  of the\n\nGSR, and an unguided upward departure ensues, the adjustment,  at\n\nleast potentially, has more than an academic effect on the actual\n\n                    \n\n     4We  waste no time in regard to the prosecution's attempt to\nconjure up a procedural  default.  Its reasoning in  this respect\nis  premised  largely  on  an extemporaneous  suggestion  by  the\nAssistant United States Attorney during the sentencing hearing to\nthe effect that the  federal probe might have started  before the\ndate of the attempted escape   a comment which went unanswered by\ndefense  counsel.    Having read  the  record  carefully, we  are\nconvinced that the government's waiver claim cannot withstand the\nmost  mild scrutiny.   Appellant fully preserved  the \"no ongoing\nfederal investigation\" point.\n\n                                5\n\nsentence because the proportionality of the departure to the  GSR\n\nis a salient factor  to be considered in judging  the departure's\n\nreasonableness.   See United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 337-\n                                             \n\n38  (1st Cir.  1990).   Accordingly, we rule  that a  decision to\n\ndepart  does  not,  as  a  general  rule, render  moot  questions\n\nconcerning the  appropriateness of the  calculations underbracing\n\nthe district court's computation  of the GSR.  See  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Mondaine, 956  F.2d 939, 943 (10th Cir. 1992)  (holding that a\n           \n\ndistrict court's  downward departure under section  4A1.3 did not\n\nmoot  the defendant's argument that he was entitled to a downward\n\nadjustment in the BOL).   Consequently, the adjustment is zoetic,\n\nnot moot; and the  defendant has standing  to protest it in  this\n\nappeal.5 \n\n                       B.  The Enhancement.\n                                           \n\n          We  turn now  to  the enhancement  itself.   We  do  so\n\nmindful that in cases where, as here, an objection to a guideline\n\nenhancement  raises a pure  question of law,  appellate review is\n\nplenary.   See United States v.  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d  698, 701 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Bell, 953 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                                 \n\n          We begin  with the language of  the relevant guideline.\n\nIt requires  sentencing courts to  jack up a  defendant's offense\n\n                    \n\n     5We recognize, of course, that  if the attempted escape from\nstate  custody could not furnish a legally cognizable basis for a\nsection 3C1.1 adjustment, it might then furnish a springboard for\ndeparting upward.  Nevertheless, we are unprepared to say, absent\nan express statement  by the district court,  that if appellant's\nlegal  argument foreclosed the  two-level enhancement,  the court\nwould simply have compensated for its inability to ratchet up the\noffense  level by boosting  the ultimate departure  sentence to a\ncorresponding degree. \n\n                                6\n\nlevel  if  \"the defendant  willfully  obstructed  or impeded,  or\n\nattempted to  obstruct or  impede, the administration  of justice\n\nduring  the  investigation,  prosecution,  or sentencing  of  the\n\ninstant  offense.\"   U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.    The commentary  to the\n\nguideline makes clear that \"escaping or attempting to escape from\n\ncustody before  trial or sentencing\" falls  within the definition\n\nof obstructive or impeding  conduct.  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment.\n\n(n.3(e)).  The case law is  in the same vein.  See  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Amos,  984 F.2d 1067, 1072 (10th  Cir. 1993); United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMelton, 970 F.2d 1328, 1335 (4th Cir. 1992).\n      \n\n          The  slightly  more  difficult  task  is defining  when\n\nconduct  can be said to have occurred \"during the investigation .\n\n.  . of  the  instant  offense.\"    Appellant  theorizes  that  a\n\nsuspect's conduct,  no matter  how deplorable, cannot  obstruct a\n\nnon-existent investigation,  and that,  therefore, if  no federal\n\nprobe  has  begun,  there  can  be   no  obstruction  within  the\n\nguideline's  reach.   This  argument  has  a certain  superficial\n\nallure, especially because the inclusion of the term \"the instant\n\noffense\"  in section 3C1.1 indicates that there must be some link\n                                                            \n\nbetween  the obstruction  and  the federal  crime  for which  the\n\naffected  defendant is  to  be sentenced.   See  generally United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Yates, 973 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n               \n\n          Be that as it may, several different reasons lead us to\n\nconclude that  appellant's argument cannot prevail.  In the first\n\nplace,  the  guidelines should  be  read in  a  common-sense way.\n\nDoing so  here  strongly  suggests  that  the  provision  may  be\n\n                                7\n\ntriggered  if, notwithstanding  the  lack of  an ongoing  federal\n\ninvestigation,   there  is   a  close   connection  between   the\n\nobstructive conduct and the offense of conviction.  In this case,\n\nthe  connection   is  skin   tight:    the   behavior  underlying\n\nappellant's arrest by local gendarmes   using  false documents to\n\nopen a series of bank accounts and withdraw funds to which he had\n\nno lawful  claim   is the  very essence of the  offense for which\n\nthe  district court  sentenced  him.   Since appellant  willfully\n\nsought to  avoid the  consequences of  his felonious  conduct, it\n\nwould  be passing strange to reward him merely because he managed\n\nto  engineer  his  attempted   escape  just  before  the  federal\n\ninvestigation formally began.             \n\n          We also believe it is important that appellant's escape\n\nattempt  would  likely  have  weighed  against  him in  the  pre-\n\nguidelines world.  See, e.g., United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357,\n                                                  \n\n360-61 (1st Cir. 1989)  (explaining that \"relevant conduct,\" such\n\nas  that occurring in the course of attempting to avoid detection\n\nor  responsibility for an offense,  is the sort  of conduct \"that\n\ncourts typically  took into account when sentencing  prior to the\n\nGuidelines'  enactment\") (citation  and internal  quotation marks\n\nomitted);  see also United States  v. Wise, 976  F.2d 393, 398-99\n                                          \n\n(8th Cir. 1992) (en banc), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 1592 (1993).\n                                       \n\nWe have often recognized that pre-guidelines precedent can have a\n\ndefinite  role  in  resolving  interpretive questions  under  the\n\nguidelines.   See, e.g., United  States v. Blanco,  888 F.2d 907,\n                                                 \n\n910  (1st Cir.  1989)  (acknowledging that  adjustment provisions\n\n                                8\n\nrepresent the  Sentencing Commission's attempt to  tie punishment\n\nto  real,   rather  than  charged,  conduct,   and  indicate  the\n\nCommission's  recognition  of   the  \"desirability  of  emulating\n\ntypical pre-Guidelines practice\" in this respect).  We think this\n\nprinciple has pertinence  in the situation at hand:   there is no\n\nreason  to  assume that  the  Sentencing  Commission intended  to\n\nsupplant the long-settled praxis of awarding stiffer sentences to\n\nthose who defy official custody. \n\n          In the third place, the  case law supports the district\n\ncourt's  action.    The  Ninth  Circuit  has  held  squarely that\n\nobstructive  conduct   engaged   in  during   an  ongoing   state\n\ninvestigation but  prior to the  formal initiation  of a  federal\n\nprobe can form the  basis of an enhancement under  section 3C1.1.\n\nSee United States  v. Lato,  934 F.2d 1080,  1082-83 (9th  Cir.),\n                          \n\ncert. denied,  112 S. Ct. 271  (1991).  A number  of other courts\n            \n\nhave  apparently  adopted  this   view  sub  silentio,  upholding\n                                                     \n\nobstruction-of-justice enhancements despite the fact  that only a\n\nstate  or  local  indagation was  underway  at  the  time of  the\n\nenhancement-producing event.  See, e.g., United States v. Dortch,\n                                                                \n\n923 F.2d  629, 632 (8th Cir. 1991);  United States v. Rogers, 917\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 165, 168  (5th Cir. 1990) (per curiam), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                         \n\nCt.  1318 (1991); United States v. Roberson, 872 F.2d 597, 609-10\n                                           \n\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 861 (1989).   \n                        \n\n          Finally, the commentary to the guidelines is hospitable\n\nto the conclusion that we  reach today.  It refers to  attempting\n\nescape \"from custody,\" misleading \"a law enforcement officer\" and\n\n                                9\n\nobstructing   \"an  official  investigation,\"  U.S.S.G.     3C1.1,\n\ncomment.    (n.3), without  any  limitation  to federal  custody,\n                                                       \n\nfederal officers,  or official federal investigations.   We think\n                                      \n\nthat the Sentencing Commission's repeated employment  of generic,\n\nall-encompassing  terms is  a  telltale, indicating  how  section\n\n3C1.1 should be construed.  Cf. United States v.  Fiore, 983 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1,  2  (1st Cir.  1992) (discussing  degree  of deference  due to\n\nSentencing  Commission's view  of a  guideline provision),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,     S.  Ct.     (1993); United States v. Weston, 960 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n212, 219  (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that  application notes and\n\ncommentary   \"are  important   interpretive  aids,   entitled  to\n\nconsiderable respect\").  \n\n          In sum, the obstruction-of-justice enhancement rests on\n\nthe rationale  that \"a defendant who commits a crime and then . .\n\n.  [makes] an  unlawful attempt  to avoid responsibility  is more\n\nthreatening  to  society and  less deserving  of leniency  than a\n\ndefendant who  does not  so defy\" the  criminal justice  process.\n\nUnited  States v.  Dunnigan, 113 S.  Ct. 1111, 1118  (1993).  The\n                           \n\nthreat that a defendant poses is not lessened by the happenstance\n\nof  fleeing  state  rather  than  federal  custody,  nor  is  the\n\ndefendant's claim  to leniency strengthened by that happenstance.\n\nThus,  consistent  with  the   Dunnigan  Court's  rationale,  the\n                                       \n\nSentencing  Commission's  discernible  intent,  a  traditionalist\n\napproach to sentencing, and the weight of authority, we hold that\n\nso long as some official investigation is underway at the time of\n               \n\nthe obstructive  conduct, the absence of  a federal investigation\n                                                   \n\n                                10\n\nis  not an  absolute bar  to  the imposition  of a  section 3C1.1\n\nenhancement.6   The  instant  case falls  comfortably within  the\n\nzone in which such an enhancement is permissible. \n\nIII.  THE UPWARD DEPARTURE\n\n          The  second arrow  in  appellant's quiver  targets  the\n\nupward  departure.    We   examine  such  departures  within  the\n\ntripartite framework  erected in United States v. Diaz-Villafane,\n                                                                \n\n874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862 (1989).\n                                           \n\nWe  first review de novo whether the circumstances relied upon by\n                        \n\nthe  sentencing court  are,  as  a  legal matter,  sufficient  to\n\njustify  a  departure; we  then  apply  clear-error oversight  to\n\ndetermine  whether these  circumstances, if  conceptually proper,\n\nactually exist in  the particular case;  and, finally, we  review\n\nthe  direction and  degree of  the departure  for reasonableness.\n\nSee id. at 49; see also United States v. Trinidad-Lopez, 979 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n249, 252 (1st Cir. 1992); Unite States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, 96-\n                                               \n\n97 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Explicitly conceding that the  first two prongs of this\n\ntest  are  satisfied  here,  appellant  assails  the  departure's\n\n                    \n\n     6We are aware that  one court has held that  an obstruction-\nof-justice adjustment may lie even if no investigation   federal,\nstate, or  local   is in  progress.  See United  States v. Barry,\n                                                                \n938 F.2d  1327, 1334-35 (D.C.  Cir. 1991).  Although  we need not\nreach this question, we view Barry's continued vitality with some\n                                  \nskepticism.   For  one thing, amendments  to the  commentary have\ndeleted much of the language relied upon by the Barry court.  See\n                                                                 \nU.S.S.G. App.  C at amend. 347.   For another thing,  the text of\nthe  obstruction section, on its face, seems to require that some\ninvestigation be underway.  See U.S.S.G.   3C1.1; see also United\n                                                                 \nStates  v Kirkland, 985 F.2d 535, 537-38 (11th Cir. 1993); United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Luna, 909 F.2d 119, 120 (5th Cir. 1990) (per curiam).\n              \n\n                                11\n\nmagnitude.     He  contends   that  the  district   court  failed\n\nsufficiently  to justify the degree of its departure and that the\n\nsentence imposed  is beyond the  bounds of  reasonableness.   His\n\ncontentions are insubstantial.\n\n                       A.  Stating Reasons.\n                                           \n\n          It is  true  that a  sentencing  court must  provide  a\n\nstatement of the  reasons undergirding a departure  from the GSR.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   3553(c) (1988).   Here, however, the lower  court\n   \n\nhonored  the  statutory  imperative,  furnishing  three  specific\n\nreasons for the  departure.  It found that (1)  there was a great\n\nlikelihood   of  recidivism,7  (2)  appellant's  record  included\n\nseveral  offenses for which  he had received  no criminal history\n\npoints, yet,  even so, his criminal history score far outstripped\n\nwhat was  necessary to place him  in CHC VI, and  (3) appellant's\n\nrecord  also revealed  sentences of  substantially more  than one\n\nyear  imposed as  a  result of  independent  crimes committed  on\n\ndifferent  occasions.  Once the court gave so precise a statement\n\n                    \n\n     7Appellant's  offhand  suggestion  that the  district  court\nlacked a factual basis for this conclusion is jejune.  The  court\nsupportably found  that appellant  began planning the  offense of\nconviction  while still  in prison  and embarked upon  it \"almost\nimmediately  upon  release.\"   The  court  could reasonably  have\nbelieved that so brief  an interval between being a  prisoner and\nimplementing a  sophisticated crime was a  fair indication, under\nall  the  circumstances,  that  recidivism was  a  highly  likely\neventuality.  We discern no clear error in this finding. \n\n                                12\n\nof  reasons, the statute was satisfied.8   We do not think that a\n\ndistrict court must dissect its departure decision, explaining in\n\nmathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice\n\nmade in arriving at  the precise sentence.  See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nAymelek, 926  F.2d 64, 70  (1st Cir.  1991); Ocasio, 914  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n336.  To impose such a requirement under the  guise of procedural\n\nreasonableness would simply add  a layer of unnecessary formality\n\nto  the departure  equation.9   We  flatly  reject so  auxetic  a\n\nnotion, preferring to regard reasonableness  as \"a concept, not a\n\nconstant.\"  Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 336.\n                  \n\n          Let  us  be perfectly  clear.    Under the  guidelines,\n\n                    \n\n     8We note  in passing  that each  of the three  circumstances\nidentified by the  court below comprises a  permissible basis for\nan upward  departure.   To  illustrate,  a sentencing  court  may\nconsider departing when the CHC \"does not adequately reflect  the\nseriousness  of  the defendant's  past  criminal  conduct or  the\nlikelihood  that   the  defendant  will   commit  other  crimes.\"\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3.  Among the items of \"reliable information\" that\nmay indicate the presence  of such a situation are  the existence\nof  \"prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history\ncategory\" and  \"prior sentence(s) of substantially  more than one\nyear  imposed as  a  result of  independent  crimes committed  on\ndifferent occasions.\"  U.S.S.G.   4A1.3(a), (b).\n\n     9Of  course,  we  speak  in terms  of  unguided  departures.\n                                                    \nSection 4A1.3, as it  stood at the time appellant  was sentenced,\noffered no guidance as to the extent of an upward departure based\non the criminal  history of a defendant in CHC  VI.  See Aymelek,\n                                                                \n926  F.2d at  70; Ocasio,  914 F.2d  at 336  n.4.   The operative\n                        \nguideline  has  since been  amended  to  indicate  that,  when  a\nsentencing court seeks to  depart upward from CHC VI,  it \"should\nstructure  the   departure  by  moving  incrementally   down  the\nsentencing  table to  the next higher  offense level  in Criminal\nHistory Category  VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate\nto the case.\"  U.S.S.G.    4A1.3 (Nov. 1992); U.S.S.G. App.  C at\namend.   460.    However, appellant  does  not suggest  that  the\ndistrict court  should have followed this  particular methodology\nin applying the  pre-amendment version of section 4A1.3.   Hence,\nwe do not consider the question. \n\n                                13\n\nupward departures  carry with them a certain  burden to explicate\n\nthe  decisionmaking  process.    See  Aymelek,  926  F.2d  at  70\n                                             \n\n(observing  that  a  sentencing  court  must  clearly  articulate\n\nreasons for the scope of the departure).  But when  the court has\n\nprovided a reasoned justification for its decision to depart, and\n\nthat  statement constitutes  an  adequate summary  from which  an\n\nappellate   tribunal  can   gauge  the   reasonableness   of  the\n\ndeparture's  extent,  it has  no  obligation  to  go further  and\n\nattempt  to quantify the impact of each incremental factor on the\n\ndeparture  sentence.   See  id.  (ruling  that, in  reference  to\n                               \n\nunguided departures, \"a  sentencing court need not  resort at all\n\nto analogies\");  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d  at 51-52  (questioning\n                               \n\nthe  wisdom of  allowing unguided  departure decisions  to become\n\nmere \"matter[s] of arithmetic\"  or products of \"mechanistic bean-\n\ncounting\").10     Here,    the  sentencing   court's  articulated\n\ngrounds  for  departing  permit   us  adequately  to  assess  the\n\nreasonableness of the  departure sentence.  No more  is exigible.\n\nSee  Williams  v. United  States, 112  S.  Ct. 1112,  1121 (1992)\n                                \n\n(stating  that in  gauging the reasonableness  of a  departure, a\n\n                    \n\n     10While this  circuit has explicitly refused  to subject the\nconcept of  reasonableness to  formulaic constraints, some  other\ncircuits  have mandated  a more  mechanical approach  to unguided\ndepartures.   See, e.g., United  States v. Thomas,  930 F.2d 526,\n                                                 \n531  (7th Cir.)  (\"The  sentencing judge  is  . .  . required  to\narticulate  the specific  factors  justifying the  extent of  his\ndeparture and to adjust the defendant's sentence by utilizing  an\nincremental  process that  quantifies the  impact of  the factors\nconsidered by the court on defendant's sentence.\"), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n112  S. Ct. 171 (1991);  United States v.  Lira-Barraza, 941 F.2d\n                                                       \n745,  748-50 (9th  Cir.  1991) (en  banc)  (similar).   With  due\nrespect  for this difference of opinion, we adhere to our circuit\nprecedent.\n\n                                14\n\nreviewing tribunal must \"look[]  to the amount and extent  of the\n\ndeparture  in  light of  the grounds  for  departing\" and  to the\n\npurposes of sentencing).  \n\n                       B.  Reasonableness.\n                                          \n\n          We move  now to  a consideration of  the reasonableness\n\nvel non of the departure.  In this case, the district court hiked\n       \n\nappellant's  sentence   by  twenty-one  months,  an  increase  of\n\napproximately  41%  over  the  GSR's ceiling.    Considering  the\n\nseriousness of  appellant's past criminal conduct,  the extent to\n\nwhich  his  criminal history  score  exceeded  that required  for\n\nmembership in CHC  VI, and the court's  supportable finding anent\n\nlikely  recidivism, we  cannot  say that  the  magnitude of  this\n\ndeparture is unreasonable.   See, e.g., Brown, 899 F.2d  at 96-97\n                                             \n\n(upholding   as  reasonable   a  twelve-month   upward  departure\n\nrepresenting a  133% increase  over the  GSR's  ceiling);   Diaz-\n                                                                 \n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d at 51-52 (upholding  as reasonable an eighty-\n         \n\nseven month  upward departure  representing a 264%  increase over\n\nthe GSR's top end); see also Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 337 (identifying\n                                   \n\nfactors to be considered in reasonableness review). \n\n          Appellant's  contention  that  the  court  below  acted\n\nunreasonably because  it failed adequately to consider mitigating\n\ncircumstances, namely, the  chronological sequence and  declining\n\nseverity of  his previous  convictions, is  utterly unconvincing.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, defense counsel urged the court not to\n\ndepart because many of  Emery's violent crimes took place  in his\n\nyouth.    The court  explicitly  responded  to this  exhortation,\n\n                                15\n\nstating:  \"it is true that there has  been some sort of hiatus in\n\nthe seriousness  of the criminal  activity, but there  is clearly\n\nreason here for upward departure.\"   This is not a case, then, in\n\nwhich   the  district  court   did  not  consider  countervailing\n\nconsiderations.  See Ocasio, 914 F.2d  at 337.  Rather, the court\n                           \n\nfocused on the grounds for mitigation but chose not to attach the\n\nweight  to  them  that   appellant  obviously  preferred.    This\n\nconsidered  weighing is  just the  sort  of \"judgment  call\" that\n\nshould   not   ordinarily  be   disturbed   in   the  course   of\n\nreasonableness review, Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49, especially\n                                     \n\nwhen,  as  now, the  ostensibly  aggrieved  party has  given  the\n\nappellate court  no solid reason  to question  the trial  judge's\n\ncalibration of the scales.  \n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    The court  below  plainly\n\nfashioned  the   sentence  with  defense  counsel's   recital  of\n\nmitigating circumstances in mind.  The end product   a twenty-one\n\nmonth upward departure   represented a choice that discounted the\n\nimportance  of those circumstances  but that,  nevertheless, came\n\nwell within the court's discretion. \n\nAffirmed.\n         \n\n                                16\n",

Finding  both the\n\nenhancement and the departure to be lawful, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant-appellant  Charles  E.  Emery  met  Thomas H.\n\nSchmoock  when the two men were  serving overlapping sentences at\n\nthe  state  penitentiary  in  Thomaston, Maine.    Appellant  was\n\nreleased in late April of 1991 and Schmoock went free a few weeks\n\nlater.   On May  28, 1991,  the  pair began  executing a  complex\n\ncheck-kiting scheme.  \n\n          In the scheme's preliminary  stage, one of the culprits\n\nposed  as  an agent  of the  Internal  Revenue Service  (IRS) and\n\nsolicited information  from an  unsuspecting dupe, one  Thomas E.\n\nMitchell.   Emery and Schmoock used this information to procure a\n\ncopy  of  Mitchell's  birth  certificate;  they  used  the  birth\n\ncertificate to obtain a  driver's license bearing Mitchell's name\n\nbut Emery's photograph; and they used the license to open several\n\n                    \n\n     1Except where otherwise indicated, all references are to the\nNovember, 1991 edition of the guidelines, which were in effect at\nthe  time of sentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Harotunian,\n                                                                \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                2\n\nchecking accounts  in Mitchell's name at  federally insured banks\n\nin Maine and Massachusetts.\n\n          In the scheme's second  phase, Emery deposited a number\n\nof  forged checks drawn on funds of  Lisa and David Holt into the\n\nnewly opened accounts.2 He and Schmoock then  began kiting checks\n\nin escalating  amounts among  the three bogus  Mitchell accounts.\n\nFortunately,  bank officials soon caught  the scent.   On June 6,\n\n1991, officers  of the Sanford, Maine  police department arrested\n\nboth  men.   They promptly  attempted to  escape from  the county\n\njail,  but their escape attempt was no more successful than their\n\ncheck-kiting swindle.  \n\n          Although no  federal investigation had  been mounted to\n\nthis  point, one  followed  shortly.   On  November 21,  1991,  a\n\nfederal  grand  jury  indicted  appellant  on  a  gallimaufry  of\n\ncharges.   He pleaded guilty to impersonation of an IRS agent and\n\nbank  fraud.  See 18 U.S.C.    912,  1344 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990).\n                 \n\nAt sentencing, the court set the base offense level (BOL) at six,\n\nsee U.S.S.G.    2F1.1 (establishing BOL for  bank fraud),3 raised\n   \n\nit seven levels  because of the dollars in issue,  see U.S.S.G.  \n                                                      \n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(H) (providing  for a  seven-level  increase if  fraud\n\ninvolves  $120,000 or  more  but less  than $200,000),  added two\n\nlevels because the crime required more than minimal planning, see\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     2The checks, bearing the imprimatur of a New Hampshire bank,\nwere blank when stolen from the Holts' home several days earlier.\n\n     3Because the  impersonation count carried the  same BOL, see\n                                                                 \nU.S.S.G.     2J1.4,  it  became irrelevant  to  establishing  the\noffense   level  in  this   multiple-count  case.     See  id.   \n                                                              \n2J1.4(c)(1).\n\n                                3\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2)(A), added  two more levels for obstruction\n\nof justice, see U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, and subtracted two  levels for\n               \n\nacceptance of responsibility, see  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  Appellant's\n                                 \n\nadjusted offense level was, therefore, fifteen.  \n\n          Under the guidelines, the GSR is determined by plotting\n\nthe  intersection of two lines:   the adjusted  offense level and\n\nthe  defendant's  criminal history  category (CHC).   The  CHC is\n\nmeasured  in terms of assigned criminal history points; it ranges\n\nfrom I (for a person with fewer than two criminal history points)\n\nto VI (for a person with thirteen points or more).   See U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\nCh.5, Pt.A  (sentencing table).   Appellant sported  an extensive\n\ncriminal history involving an assortment of violent felonies and,\n\nmore  recently,  some less  serious  peccadillos.   His  score of\n\ntwenty  criminal  history  points surpassed  the  thirteen points\n\nneeded to place him in CHC VI.  The GSR was, therefore, forty-one\n\nto  fifty- one  months.   See  id. (offense  level  15; CHC  VI).\n                                  \n\nAbjuring  a sentence within  the GSR the  district judge departed\n\nupward, imposing an incarcerative sentence of seventy-two months.\n\n          In this appeal, appellant bemoans both the obstruction-\n\nof-justice enhancement and the upward departure.  We address each\n\nlamentation in turn.\n\nII.  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\n\n          Appellant does not challenge the factual basis on which\n\nthe  district  court  found  an  obstruction  of  justice     the\n\nprobation officer's report, credited  by the district court, made\n\nmanifest appellant's  attempt to  escape from official  custody  \n\n                                4\n\nbut,  instead,  posits  that   conduct  otherwise  sufficient  to\n\nconstitute an obstruction of justice under the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines   an attempted escape   is inoculated against such use\n\nif  it occurs prior to the initiation of a federal investigation.\n                                                  \n\nThe government  seeks to rebut  this theorem  in three ways.   It\n\navers that the appellant  failed properly to preserve the  point,\n\nthat the decision to  depart rendered the  obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement moot, and that,  in any event, the court  below acted\n\nwithin its  lawful authority  in decreeing  the enhancement.   We\n\nelect to analyze the point in terms of the prosecution's last two\n\nrebuttal arguments.4\n\n                          A.  Mootness.\n                                       \n\n          We reject the government's asseveration that the upward\n\ndeparture  renders the  obstruction-of-justice adjustment  moot. \n\nHad the  district court eschewed the disputed adjustment, the GSR\n\nwould have been thirty-three  to forty-one months.   See U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\nCh.5, Pt.A (sentencing table)  (offense level 13; CHC VI).   When\n\nan adjustment in the offense  level increases the top end  of the\n\nGSR, and an unguided upward departure ensues, the adjustment,  at\n\nleast potentially, has more than an academic effect on the actual\n\n                    \n\n     4We  waste no time in regard to the prosecution's attempt to\nconjure up a procedural  default.  Its reasoning in  this respect\nis  premised  largely  on  an extemporaneous  suggestion  by  the\nAssistant United States Attorney during the sentencing hearing to\nthe effect that the  federal probe might have started  before the\ndate of the attempted escape   a comment which went unanswered by\ndefense  counsel.    Having read  the  record  carefully, we  are\nconvinced that the government's waiver claim cannot withstand the\nmost  mild scrutiny.   Appellant fully preserved  the \"no ongoing\nfederal investigation\" point.\n\n                                5\n\nsentence because the proportionality of the departure to the  GSR\n\nis a salient factor  to be considered in judging  the departure's\n\nreasonableness.

Ocasio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337-\n                                             \n\n38  (1st Cir.  1990).   Accordingly, we rule  that a  decision to\n\ndepart  does  not,  as  a  general  rule, render  moot  questions\n\nconcerning the  appropriateness of the  calculations underbracing\n\nthe district court's computation  of the GSR.  See  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Consequently, the adjustment is zoetic,\n\nnot moot; and the  defendant has standing  to protest it in  this\n\nappeal.5 \n\n                       B.

Nevertheless, we are unprepared to say, absent\nan express statement  by the district court,  that if appellant's\nlegal  argument foreclosed the  two-level enhancement,  the court\nwould simply have compensated for its inability to ratchet up the\noffense  level by boosting  the ultimate departure  sentence to a\ncorresponding degree. \n\n                                6\n\nlevel  if  \"the defendant  willfully  obstructed  or impeded,  or\n\nattempted to  obstruct or  impede, the administration  of justice\n\nduring  the  investigation,  prosecution,  or sentencing  of  the\n\ninstant  offense.\"   U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.

This  argument  has  a certain  superficial\n\nallure, especially because the inclusion of the term \"the instant\n\noffense\"  in section 3C1.1 indicates that there must be some link\n                                                            \n\nbetween  the obstruction  and  the federal  crime  for which  the\n\naffected  defendant is  to  be sentenced.   See  generally United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

In the first\n\nplace,  the  guidelines should  be  read in  a  common-sense way.\n\nDoing so  here  strongly  suggests  that  the  provision  may  be\n\n                                7\n\ntriggered  if, notwithstanding  the  lack of  an ongoing  federal\n\ninvestigation,   there  is   a  close   connection  between   the\n\nobstructive conduct and the offense of conviction.  In this case,\n\nthe  connection   is  skin   tight:    the   behavior  underlying\n\nappellant's arrest by local gendarmes   using  false documents to\n\nopen a series of bank accounts and withdraw funds to which he had\n\nno lawful  claim   is the  very essence of the  offense for which\n\nthe  district court  sentenced  him.   Since appellant  willfully\n\nsought to  avoid the  consequences of  his felonious  conduct, it\n\nwould  be passing strange to reward him merely because he managed\n\nto  engineer  his  attempted   escape  just  before  the  federal\n\ninvestigation formally began.             \n\n          We also believe it is important that appellant's escape\n\nattempt  would  likely  have  weighed  against  him in  the  pre-\n\nguidelines world.

He  contends   that  the  district   court  failed\n\nsufficiently  to justify the degree of its departure and that the\n\nsentence imposed  is beyond the  bounds of  reasonableness.   His\n\ncontentions are insubstantial.\n\n                       A.  Stating Reasons.\n                                           \n\n          It is  true  that a  sentencing  court must  provide  a\n\nstatement of the  reasons undergirding a departure  from the GSR.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   3553(c) (1988).   Here, however, the lower  court\n   \n\nhonored  the  statutory  imperative,  furnishing  three  specific\n\nreasons for the  departure.  It found that (1)  there was a great\n\nlikelihood   of  recidivism,7  (2)  appellant's  record  included\n\nseveral  offenses for which  he had received  no criminal history\n\npoints, yet,  even so, his criminal history score far outstripped\n\nwhat was  necessary to place him  in CHC VI, and  (3) appellant's\n\nrecord  also revealed  sentences of  substantially more  than one\n\nyear  imposed as  a  result of  independent  crimes committed  on\n\ndifferent  occasions.  Once the court gave so precise a statement\n\n                    \n\n     7Appellant's  offhand  suggestion  that the  district  court\nlacked a factual basis for this conclusion is jejune.  The  court\nsupportably found  that appellant  began planning the  offense of\nconviction  while still  in prison  and embarked upon  it \"almost\nimmediately  upon  release.\"   The  court  could reasonably  have\nbelieved that so brief  an interval between being a  prisoner and\nimplementing a  sophisticated crime was a  fair indication, under\nall  the  circumstances,  that  recidivism was  a  highly  likely\neventuality.  We discern no clear error in this finding. \n\n                                12\n\nof  reasons, the statute was satisfied.8   We do not think that a\n\ndistrict court must dissect its departure decision, explaining in\n\nmathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice\n\nmade in arriving at  the precise sentence.  See  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nAymelek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70  (1st Cir.  1991); Ocasio, 914  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n336.  To impose such a requirement under the  guise of procedural\n\nreasonableness would simply add  a layer of unnecessary formality\n\nto  the departure  equation.9   We  flatly  reject so  auxetic  a\n\nnotion, preferring to regard reasonableness  as \"a concept, not a\n\nconstant.\"  Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 336.\n                  \n\n          Let  us  be perfectly  clear.    Under the  guidelines,\n\n                    \n\n     8We note  in passing  that each  of the three  circumstances\nidentified by the  court below comprises a  permissible basis for\nan upward  departure.   To  illustrate,  a sentencing  court  may\nconsider departing when the CHC \"does not adequately reflect  the\nseriousness  of  the defendant's  past  criminal  conduct or  the\nlikelihood  that   the  defendant  will   commit  other  crimes.\"\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3.  Among the items of \"reliable information\" that\nmay indicate the presence  of such a situation are  the existence\nof  \"prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history\ncategory\" and  \"prior sentence(s) of substantially  more than one\nyear  imposed as  a  result of  independent  crimes committed  on\ndifferent occasions.\"  U.S.S.G.   4A1.3(a), (b).\n\n     9Of  course,  we  speak  in terms  of  unguided  departures.\n                                                    \nSection 4A1.3, as it  stood at the time appellant  was sentenced,\noffered no guidance as to the extent of an upward departure based\non the criminal  history of a defendant in CHC  VI.  See Aymelek,\n                                                                \n926  F.2d at  70; Ocasio,  914 F.2d  at 336  n.4.   The operative\n                        \nguideline  has  since been  amended  to  indicate  that,  when  a\nsentencing court seeks to  depart upward from CHC VI,  it \"should\nstructure  the   departure  by  moving  incrementally   down  the\nsentencing  table to  the next higher  offense level  in Criminal\nHistory Category  VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate\nto the case.\"  U.S.S.G.    4A1.3 (Nov. 1992); U.S.S.G. App.  C at\namend.   460.    However, appellant  does  not suggest  that  the\ndistrict court  should have followed this  particular methodology\nin applying the  pre-amendment version of section 4A1.3.   Hence,\nwe do not consider the question. \n\n                                13\n\nupward departures  carry with them a certain  burden to explicate\n\nthe  decisionmaking  process.    See  Aymelek,  926  F.2d  at  70\n                                             \n\n(observing  that  a  sentencing  court  must  clearly  articulate\n\nreasons for the scope of the departure).  But when  the court has\n\nprovided a reasoned justification for its decision to depart, and\n\nthat  statement constitutes  an  adequate summary  from which  an\n\nappellate   tribunal  can   gauge  the   reasonableness   of  the\n\ndeparture's  extent,  it has  no  obligation  to  go further  and\n\nattempt  to quantify the impact of each incremental factor on the\n\ndeparture  sentence.   See  id.

Reasonableness.\n                                          \n\n          We move  now to  a consideration of  the reasonableness\n\nvel non of the departure.  In this case, the district court hiked\n       \n\nappellant's  sentence   by  twenty-one  months,  an  increase  of\n\napproximately  41%  over  the  GSR's ceiling.    Considering  the\n\nseriousness of  appellant's past criminal conduct,  the extent to\n\nwhich  his  criminal history  score  exceeded  that required  for\n\nmembership in CHC  VI, and the court's  supportable finding anent\n\nlikely  recidivism, we  cannot  say that  the  magnitude of  this\n\ndeparture is unreasonable.   See, e.g., Brown, 899 F.2d  at 96-97\n                                             \n\n(upholding   as  reasonable   a  twelve-month   upward  departure\n\nrepresenting a  133% increase  over the  GSR's  ceiling);   Diaz-\n                                                                 \n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d at 51-52 (upholding  as reasonable an eighty-\n         \n\nseven month  upward departure  representing a 264%  increase over\n\nthe GSR's top end); see also Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 337 (identifying\n                                   \n\nfactors to be considered in reasonableness review). \n\n          Appellant's  contention  that  the  court  below  acted\n\nunreasonably because  it failed adequately to consider mitigating\n\ncircumstances, namely, the  chronological sequence and  declining\n\nseverity of  his previous  convictions, is  utterly unconvincing.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, defense counsel urged the court not to\n\ndepart because many of  Emery's violent crimes took place  in his\n\nyouth.    The court  explicitly  responded  to this  exhortation,\n\n                                15\n\nstating:  \"it is true that there has  been some sort of hiatus in\n\nthe seriousness  of the criminal  activity, but there  is clearly\n\nreason here for upward departure.\"   This is not a case, then, in\n\nwhich   the  district  court   did  not  consider  countervailing\n\nconsiderations.  See Ocasio, 914 F.2d  at 337.  Rather, the court\n                           \n\nfocused on the grounds for mitigation but chose not to attach the\n\nweight  to  them  that   appellant  obviously  preferred.    This\n\nconsidered  weighing is  just the  sort  of \"judgment  call\" that\n\nshould   not   ordinarily  be   disturbed   in   the  course   of\n\nreasonableness review, Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49, especially\n                                     \n\nwhen,  as  now, the  ostensibly  aggrieved  party has  given  the\n\nappellate court  no solid reason  to question  the trial  judge's\n\ncalibration of the scales.  \n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    The court  below  plainly\n\nfashioned  the   sentence  with  defense  counsel's   recital  of\n\nmitigating circumstances in mind.  The end product   a twenty-one\n\nmonth upward departure   represented a choice that discounted the\n\nimportance  of those circumstances  but that,  nevertheless, came\n\nwell within the court's discretion. \n\nAffirmed.\n         \n\n                                16\n</pre>",
