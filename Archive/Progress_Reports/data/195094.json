The tale follows.\n                  \n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          During a  two-month trial  in the  district court,  the\n\ngovernment mined a golconda of  evidence.  Because it would serve\n\nno useful purpose to recount the occasionally ponderous record in\n\nbook and  verse, we  offer instead an  overview of  the evidence,\n\ntaken in the light most compatible with the guilty verdicts.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 113  S. Ct. 1005 (1993).  Further  facts will be added as\n      \n\nwe discuss specific issues.\n\n          For  almost  six  years, David  Sepulveda  conducted an\n\nincreasingly sophisticated  cocaine distribution business  in and\n\naround Manchester, New Hampshire.  Initially, Sepulveda purchased\n\ncocaine from  a vendor in Nashua, New  Hampshire, and transported\n\nit  to Manchester  himself.   Over time,  Sepulveda expanded  his\n\noperation, increasing the  volume of cocaine and  engaging others\n\nto handle tasks such as pickup, delivery, and street-level sales.\n\n          As his  enterprise grew more ambitious, Sepulveda began\n\npurchasing  cocaine from  a  source  in Lawrence,  Massachusetts.\n\nFaced with the  need to retain  control while insulating  himself\n\nfrom  the prying eyes  of law enforcement  personnel, Sepulveda's\n\njourneys to Lawrence became an elaborate ritual in which he would\n\n                                4\n\nscrupulously avoid carrying  drugs or travelling in  the same car\n\nwith the cocaine that he purchased.  On these provisioning trips,\n\nSepulveda was usually  accompanied by his  brother, Edgar, and  a\n\n\"runner,\" that is, an individual who would actually transport the\n\ncocaine  from  Lawrence  to  Manchester.1    Frequently,  one  of\n\nSepulveda's  distributors  or a  user  in a  particular  hurry to\n\nobtain fresh supplies would join the troupe.\n\n          Once the cocaine arrived  in Manchester, Sepulveda  and\n\nhis  associates  packaged  it   in  street-level  quantities  and\n\ndistributed it to a series of individuals for resale and personal\n\nuse.   The buyers included,  among others,  defendants Edward  W.\n\nWelch,  Jr., Arline  S.  Welch,  Shane  Welch,  Kevin  Cullinane,\n\nChristopher Driesse, Cheryl  T. Johnson, Richard E.  Labrie, Tony\n\nRood, and William D. Wallace.  David Sepulveda made a practice of\n\ndirecting  persons who inquired about purchasing small amounts of\n\ncocaine to these same individuals.\n\n          Eventually, David Sepulveda's reach exceeded his grasp.\n\nA federal  grand jury indicted  him, along with others,  for drug\n\ntrafficking;  and, after  trial, a  petit  jury convicted  twelve\n\npersons,  viz.,  the  Sepulveda  brothers,  the  three   Welches,\n              \n\nCullinane, Driesse, Johnson, Labrie, Rood, Wallace, and Langlois,\n\non a charge of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  See\n                                                                 \n\n21 U.S.C.    846 (1988).  The jury also convicted David Sepulveda\n\non a charge of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     1At  various times,  defendants  Tony  Rood  and  Ernest  F.\nLanglois  worked as  runners.   At  other  times, Norberto  Perez\nplayed this role.\n\n                                5\n\n21 U.S.C.   848 (1988).  Twenty-six appeals ensued.\n\n          It  is  no  exaggeration to  say  that  the defendants,\n\nrepresented by able  counsel, managed to cultivate a profusion of\n\nvariegated  grounds for appeal  from the  peat of  the protracted\n\ntrial.    Because  of  the  sheer  bulk  and  complexity  of  the\n\nproceedings, we issued  a special briefing  order and then  heard\n\noral argument on all twenty-six  appeals.  We decide today twelve\n\nappeals   taken    by   ten   defendants    (collectively,   \"the\n\nappellants\").2  After sifting what  grains we can locate from the\n\nconsiderable chaff,  we conclude  that the  appellants enjoyed  a\n\nfair, substantially error-free trial, and  that their convictions\n\nmust  stand.   In two  instances, however,  we  vacate particular\n\nsentences and remand for further proceedings.\n\nII.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Four   appellants   claim   that    the   evidence   is\n\ninsufficient,  as a matter of law, to support their convictions.3\n\nBecause insufficiency claims are commonplace in criminal appeals,\n\nthe   standard  of  appellate  oversight  lends  itself  to  rote\n\n                    \n\n     2The  appeals taken  by defendants  Christopher Driesse  and\nShane Welch following the trial present certain unique issues and\nthose two  appeals will  be resolved in  a separate opinion.   In\naddition, after the  original round of appeals had been docketed,\nall twelve  defendants moved to  vacate judgment on the  basis of\nnewly discovered evidence.   The court below denied  relief and a\nfresh  battery of  appeals ensued.    Those twelve  late-blooming\nappeals were argued in  tandem with the fourteen earlier  appeals\nand will be disposed of in a third opinion.\n\n     3We  do not  include  under  this  rubric  appellants  Edgar\nSepulveda and Tony  Rood, both of whom argue  that the government\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to show their participation\nin  the single  \"master conspiracy\"  charged  in the  indictment.\nInstead, we treat with those claims in Part IX, infra.\n                                                     \n\n                                6\n\nrecitation.  Following  a guilty verdict, a  reviewing court must\n\nscrutinize  the  record,  eschewing  credibility  judgments   and\n\ndrawing all  reasonable inferences  in favor  of the verdict,  to\n\nascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government\n\nproved each element of the crime beyond  a reasonable doubt.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Echeverri, 982  F.2d 675, 677 (1st  Cir. 1993);\n                           \n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 711; United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 730\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2301\n                                                \n\n(1992).   To sustain  a conviction, the  court need  not conclude\n\nthat only a guilty verdict  appropriately could be reached; it is\n\nenough  that  the finding  of  guilt  draws  its essence  from  a\n\nplausible reading of the record.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;\n                                               \n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 711.\n     \n\n          Here, the challenged convictions center around a charge\n\nof conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  To prove a drug\n\nconspiracy  charge  under 21  U.S.C.     846,  the government  is\n\nobliged  to show  beyond  a reasonable  doubt  that a  conspiracy\n\nexisted and that a particular defendant agreed to participate  in\n\nit, intending to commit the underlying substantive offense (here,\n\npossession  of cocaine  with  intent to  distribute, 21  U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1)).    See David,  940  F.2d  at  735; United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nSanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir. 1990), cert.  denied, 111 S.\n                                                         \n\nCt. 1625 (1991); United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073,\n                                                 \n\n1079 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910 (1989).  There are no\n                             \n\nparticular formalities that  attend this showing:   the agreement\n\nmay  be  express  or  tacit  and  may  be  proved  by  direct  or\n\n                                7\n\ncircumstantial evidence.  See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679; Rivera-\n                                                                 \n\nSantiago, 872 F.2d at 1079.   Moreover, in a criminal conspiracy,\n        \n\nculpability may be constant  though responsibilities are divided;\n\nthe government does not need to show as a precursor to  a finding\n\nof guilt that a given defendant  took part in all aspects of  the\n\nconspiracy.   See United States  v. Benevides, 985 F.2d  629, 633\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1993); United  States v. Cruz, 981  F.2d 613, 617  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1992).  Using these guideposts, we find  that the quantum of\n\nevidence presented against each of the four challengers suffices.\n\n                        A.  Arline Welch.\n                                        \n\n          Four  witnesses  provided  the  bulk  of  the  evidence\n\nregarding Arline Welch's  role in the  conspiracy.  Kurt  Coriaty\n\ntestified that he had purchased cocaine from her both in her home\n\nand  in his,  particularly after  her husband, Edward  Welch, was\n\nimprisoned.  Coriaty's partner, Kenneth Milne, stated that Arline\n\nWelch  gave  him cocaine  at  her home  and was  present  when he\n\npurchased  cocaine  from  Edward Welch  at  the  Welch residence.\n\nWhile mere presence is not sufficient to ground criminal charges,\n\na defendant's presence at the point of a drug sale, taken  in the\n\nlight of attendant circumstances, can constitute strong  evidence\n\nof complicity.  See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711-12.\n                         \n\n          The  jury also heard Norberto Perez explain that Arline\n\nWelch  accompanied David Sepulveda on three buying expeditions to\n\nLawrence,  Massachusetts.   Perez testified  that, in  expressing\n\nanxiety, she made  manifest her awareness of the  trips' purpose,\n\nvoicing statements like:  \"Let's hurry up and get this cocaine so\n\n                                8\n\nwe can get out of  here.\"  Furthermore, Randall Vetrone testified\n\nthat  Arline Welch  was present  in  Edgar Sepulveda's  apartment\n\nwhile  the   Sepulveda  brothers   packaged  and   sold  cocaine.\n\nAppellant's consensual presence in a  private home, not her  own,\n\nwhile large quantities of  drugs were being packaged for  resale,\n\npossessed evidentiary significance.  From this fact, coupled with\n\nother  contextual detail  (much  of  it  inculpatory),  the  jury\n\nreasonably could have inferred that she was a member of the ring.\n\nSee Ortiz,  966 F.2d at  712 (pointing out that  criminals rarely\n         \n\nseek  to expose their felonious activities to innocent outsiders,\n\nwhere such  exposure could easily  be avoided); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nBatista-Polanco,  927 F.2d  14, 18-19  (1st Cir.  1991)  (to like\n               \n\neffect).\n\n          Keeping in mind the maxim that \"criminal juries are not\n\nexpected to  ignore what  is perfectly  obvious,\" Echeverri,  982\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at 679,  the  testimony  of these  four  witnesses and  the\n\nreasonable  inferences to be drawn therefrom formed a serviceable\n\npredicate  upon  which to  rest  a conviction  for  conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine.4  Accordingly, the district court did not err\n\nin denying Arline Welch's motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\n                       B.  Kevin Cullinane.\n                                          \n\n          Daniel  Santos, a quondam partner of Cullinane's in the\n\n                    \n\n     4We give short shrift to Welch's argument, echoed at various\ntimes by other appellants, that, because some of the government's\nwitnesses anticipated receiving reduced sentences in exchange for\ncooperation,  their  testimony should  be regarded  as inherently\nunreliable.   When an appellate  court reviews the sufficiency of\nthe  evidence, it must  resolve routine credibility  questions in\nfavor of the verdict.  See David, 940 F.2d at 730.\n                                \n\n                                9\n\ndrug distribution  trade, testified that Cullinane introduced him\n\nto  David  Sepulveda  and  that  Sepulveda  eventually  became  a\n\nprincipal   supplier   of   cocaine   to   the   Cullinane-Santos\n\npartnership.  Santos  also testified  that Cullinane  accompanied\n\nSepulveda on provisioning trips, returning to  Santos's apartment\n\nwith fresh supplies of contraband.  The ubiquitous Norberto Perez\n\ncorroborated  this relationship, testifying that he had travelled\n\nto  Lawrence  on  at  least  five occasions  in  the  company  of\n\nCullinane  and the  Sepulveda  siblings  in  order  to  replenish\n\ncocaine stores.   Perez also  recreated a conversation  that took\n\nplace  between  Cullinane and  Sepulveda  involving  the former's\n\nindebtedness to the latter for transactions in cocaine.\n\n          The government adduced abundant evidence that Cullinane\n\ndistributed much of the contraband he acquired.  Perez and Santos\n\nboth described Cullinane's  activities as  a vendor.   John  Rice\n\ntestified   that  Cullinane   delivered   cocaine  to   defendant\n\nChristopher Driesse, and that Driesse,  in turn, would resell the\n\ndrugs.  Santos confirmed that Cullinane procured these drugs from\n\nDavid  Sepulveda and that Sepulveda extended credit to Cullinane.\n\nAnother  witness, David Chase, acknowledged that he had purchased\n\nup to eight kilograms of cocaine from Cullinane before concluding\n\nthat,  aphorisms  about   honor  among  thieves  notwithstanding,\n\nCullinane could not be trusted.5\n\n          In  view of  this  plenitudinous  testimony, the  court\n\n                    \n\n     5When Chase and Cullinane fell  out, Chase took his business\ndirectly to David Sepulveda.\n\n                                10\n\nbelow appropriately derailed Cullinane's quest for acquittal as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n                       C.  Ernest Langlois.\n                                          \n\n          David  Sepulveda hired  Langlois  to  be  both  a  drug\n\ncourier  and  a torpedo.   Langlois's  resounding success  in the\n\nlatter  role    intimidating Sepulveda's debtors  and, sometimes,\n\nhis  associates    produced  a  suffusion  of  testimony  limning\n\nLanglois's role in  the organization.   For instance, David  Hill\n\ndescribed four occasions on which Langlois used force, or threats\n\nof  force,  to  collect  debts  owed to  Sepulveda.    Two  other\n\nwitnesses testified that Sepulveda boasted of  employing Langlois\n\nas a strongarm to collect  drug debts.  Another witness overheard\n\nLanglois  crowing about  the nature  of his  employment.   And no\n\nfewer  than  six  witnesses  relayed  information  from  which  a\n\nrational jury  could infer  that Langlois  \"rode shotgun\"  during\n\ndrug-buying expeditions.\n\n          As  this  partial   summary  indicates,  the   evidence\n\naccumulated  against Langlois rose well above the level necessary\n\nto sustain the jury's verdict.\n\n                       D.  Cheryl Johnson.\n                                         \n\n          Two witnesses, Santos and  Kathy Malone (an  undercover\n\npolice  officer), testified  that David  Sepulveda  sent them  to\n\nCheryl Johnson when they wanted to buy cocaine.  Santos said that\n\nhe  purchased cocaine from  Johnson on approximately  one hundred\n\noccasions, during which transactions Johnson offhandedly revealed\n\n                                11\n\nthe full extent of her  copious cocaine inventory.  Malone stated\n\nthat  she purchased  cocaine from  Johnson  on three  occasions.6\n\nPerez  testified that  he,  too,  bought  cocaine  from  Johnson,\n\ndelivered  cocaine  to   Johnson  at   Sepulveda's  behest,   and\n\naccompanied her on at least one buying trip to Lawrence.\n\n          Although Johnson argues  vehemently that the  witnesses\n\nagainst  her were inherently  unreliable, courts must  leave such\n\ncredibility determinations in the jury's  domain.  See David, 940\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  730.   Here,  the jury  was  at liberty  to  credit the\n\ntestimony, and it,  in turn, supplied all  the elements necessary\n\nto convict.\n\nIII.  SEQUESTRATION\n\n          Appellants claim  that, shortly after  sentencing, they\n\nlearned for the  first time that the government  housed three key\n\nwitnesses (Perez, Milne, and Coriaty) in the same cell throughout\n\nthe trial.  Appellants moved for a  new trial,7 alleging that the\n\nhousing arrangements violated a sequestration order issued by the\n\ndistrict  court.  The  government not only  contested appellants'\n\nconclusion but also contested the premise on which the conclusion\n\n                    \n\n     6Both  Santos and  Malone also  testified  that they  bought\ncocaine from defendant Richard Labrie at Johnson's abode.\n\n     7These motions are separate from,  and much earlier in  time\nthan,  the  motions  to  which  we  alluded  in  note  2,  supra.\n                                                                \nNonetheless,  these motions, like the later motions, invoked Fed.\nR. Crim.  P. 33. We  grant appellants a  considerable indulgence,\nassuming arguendo that the  information concerning the witnesses'\n                 \nliving arrangements was  not discoverable before or  during trial\nwith the exercise of due diligence.  See United States  v. Slade,\n                                                                \n980  F.2d 27, 29 (1st  Cir. 1992) (articulating standard); United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Natanel,  938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st  Cir. 1991) (similar),\n                 \ncert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 986 (1992).\n            \n\n                                12\n\nrested, asserting that,  though the three men  were lodged within\n\nthe same cell block, they did not share a cell.\n\n          For  reasons that  are  somewhat  opaque, the  district\n\ncourt  denied the motion  without a hearing  and without findings\n\nanent the accuracy of  appellants' \"three to a cell\"  allegation.\n\nInstead, the court  determined that, regardless of  the dormitory\n\narrangements, its sequestration  order had not been flouted.   It\n\nis against this  rather spartan background that  we undertake our\n\nanalysis.8\n\n                          A.  Rule 615.\n                                      \n\n          The  sanctum  sanctorum   of  supervised  sequestration\n                                 \n\nstates in its salient segment:\n\n               At  the request  of  a party  the  court\n          shall order witnesses  excluded so that  they\n          cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses,\n          and it may make the order of its own motion.\n\nFed. R.  Evid. 615.   The rule  more or less  codifies common-law\n\nsequestration powers, but  it is at  once less discretionary  and\n\nless stringent  than its forebears.  On one hand, the rule cabins\n\nthe judge's discretion by affording  all parties a right to close\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n     8To recognize that the record  sheds no light on the factual\nunderpinnings of the  sequestration dispute is not to  imply that\nthe  defense lacked  opportunity to  explore  the possibility  of\nsequestration  violations.    During  trial,  appellants   cross-\nexamined  all three witnesses  at length, inquiring,  inter alia,\n                                                                \nwhether they had discussed the case with others.  The examination\nelicited no  evidence that the trio traded tales concerning past,\npresent, or future  testimony.  Cf. United States  v. Eyster, 948\n                                                            \nF.2d 1196, 1210 (11th  Cir. 1991) (finding that  witnesses housed\nin  the same  cell  who admitted  discussing testimony  with each\nother violated a sequestration order).  Moreover, appellants knew\nall  along that  Perez, Milne,  and Coriaty  dwelled at  the same\npenitentiary,  yet  they  made no  specific  inquiries  about the\ncongregant housing arrangement.\n\n                                13\n\nthe  courtroom to  prospective witnesses.9   On  the other  hand,\n\nwhile  the   common  law   supported  sequestration   beyond  the\n\ncourtroom, see 6 John Wigmore, Evidence   1840, at 471 n.7 (1976)\n                                       \n\n(stating  that, at common law, the sequestration process involves\n\nthree  parts:  preventing  prospective witnesses  from consulting\n\neach  other; preventing  witnesses  from hearing  other witnesses\n\ntestify;  and preventing  prospective  witnesses from  consulting\n\nwitnesses  who have already  testified), Rule 615  contemplates a\n\nsmaller  reserve;  by  its terms,  courts  must  \"order witnesses\n\nexcluded\" only from the courtroom proper, see Perry v. Leeke, 488\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 272,  281 &amp; n.4  (1989); United States  v. Arruda,  715 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n671, 684 (1st Cir. 1983).  In  sum, the rule demarcates a compact\n\nprocedural heartland,  but leaves appreciable  room for  judicial\n\ninnovation  beyond  the   perimeters  of  that  which   the  rule\n\nexplicitly requires.   See United States v. De Jongh, 937 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n3  (1st  Cir.   1991)  (stating  that  district   courts  possess\n\n\"considerable  discretion\"   to  fashion  orders   pertaining  to\n\nsequestration).10\n\n                    \n\n     9The  rule's  stringencies  in that  respect  have  not been\nadopted by all states.  See  6 John Wigmore, Evidence   1837,  at\n                                                     \n458  n.11 (1976);  see also  id.  at 35  (Supp. 1991)  (compiling\n                                \ndata).    Rather,  many states  continue  to  leave sequestration\ndecisions solely within the judge's  discretion.  See, e.g., R.I.\n                                                           \nR. Evid. 615.\n\n     10Citing United States v. Greschner, 802 F.2d 373 (10th Cir.\n                                        \n1986),  cert. denied, 480  U.S. 908 (1987),  appellants postulate\n                    \nthat Rule 615  requires sequestration beyond the  courtroom door.\nAlthough Greschner does equate \"circumvention\" of Rule 615 with a\n                  \nviolation of the  rule itself, it concedes that  controlling such\ncircumvention  rests within the  district court's discretion    a\ncondition that clearly  does not apply to violations  of Rule 615\nitself.    Id. at  375-76.    Thus,  Greschner fails  to  support\n                                              \n\n                                14\n\n          Outside of the  heartland, the district court  may make\n\nwhatever provisions  it deems necessary  to manage trials  in the\n\ninterests of  justice, see  id., including  the sequestration  of\n                               \n\nwitnesses before, during,  and after their testimony,  see Geders\n                                                                 \n\nv.  United States,  425 U.S.  80, 87  (1976), and  compelling the\n                 \n\nparties to present witnesses in a prescribed sequence, see United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Machor,  879  F.2d  945, 954  (1st  Cir. 1989),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 1094 (1990).  Rule 615 neither dictates when and\n      \n\nhow this case-management power ought  to be used nor mandates any\n\nspecific   extra-courtroom  prophylaxis,   instead  leaving   the\n\nregulation  of witness  conduct  outside  the  courtroom  to  the\n\ndistrict judge's discretion.  See United States v. Arias-Santana,\n                                                                \n\n964 F.2d  1262, 1266 (1st  Cir. 1992) (explaining that  a federal\n\ntrial court may  enter non-discussion orders at  its discretion);\n\nsee  also  Arruda,  715  F.2d  at 684  (holding  that  there  was\n                 \n\n\"technically\"  no  violation  of  sequestration  where  witnesses\n\nconversed outside the courtroom).\n                 \n\n          This  is not to say, however, that sequestration orders\n\nwhich affect witnesses outside the courtroom are a  rarity.  As a\n\npractical  matter,  district  courts  routinely  exercise   their\n\ndiscretion  to augment Rule 615 by instructing witnesses, without\n\nmaking  fine spatial distinctions,  that they are  not to discuss\n\ntheir  testimony.     Indeed,  such  non-discussion   orders  are\n\ngenerally  thought  to   be  a  standard  concomitant   of  basic\n\nsequestration fare, serving to fortify the protections offered by\n\n                    \n\nappellants' thesis.\n\n                                15\n\nRule 615.  See Perry, 488 U.S. at 281-82.\n                    \n\n               B.  Sequestration and Cohabitation.\n                                                 \n\n          Here,  appellants   moved  in  advance  of   trial  for\n\nsequestration  without  indicating  to the  court  what  level of\n\nrestraint they thought appropriate.  The court granted the motion\n\nin   its  simplest   aspect,   directing  counsel   \"to   monitor\n\nsequestration\"  and ordering \"that  witnesses who are  subject to\n\n[the court's] order are not to be present in the courtroom at any\n\ntime prior to  their appearance to render testimony.\"   At trial,\n\nthe district court expanded its earlier order beyond the Rule 615\n\nminimum,  instructing each  witness at  the close  of his  or her\n\ntestimony  not to discuss that  testimony with any other witness.\n\nAppellants accepted the conditions of sequestration described  by\n\nthe court  without demurrer.  What is  more, they did not request\n\nany further instructions, say, that witnesses  be directed at the\n\nend of each  day, or  before each  recess, not  to discuss  their\n\ntestimony.    Thus,  every  witness was  placed  under  an  order\n\nprohibiting discussion of the case with other witnesses only upon\n\nthe completion of his or her testimony.\n\n          On these facts,  the district court's denial  of relief\n\nmust be  upheld.   The court's  basic sequestration order,  which\n\nploughed a straight furrow in line with Rule 615  itself, did not\n\nextend beyond the  courtroom.  There has been  no intimation that\n\nthe witnesses  transgressed this  order.   Moreover, because  the\n\ndistrict  court  did   not  promulgate  a  non-discussion   order\n\napplicable to any witness until  the conclusion of that witness's\n\n                                16\n\ntestimony,  Perez, Milne, and  Coriaty were under  no obligation,\n\nprior   to  that  moment,   to  refrain  from   discussing  their\n\nrecollections with  each other.   Finally,  there is no  evidence\n\nthat any of  the three ever chatted  about the case  with another\n\nwitness after having been admonished to the  contrary   or at any\n\nearlier time, for that matter.\n\n          Given this predicate, appellants' plaint reduces to the\n\nunprecedented proposition  that witness  cohabitation constitutes\n\nan automatic violation  of a standard  sequestration order.   The\n\ncrux   of  sequestration,   however,  is   communication  between\n\nwitnesses,  not shared  accommodations  or geographic  proximity.\n\nSocial  settings, such as communal  housing or common work sites,\n\nmay offer opportunities for witnesses to compare notes and gossip\n\nabout their testimony, but  such environments do not ensure  that\n\nforbidden  conversations will occur.   We assume  that witnesses,\n\nlike all other  persons subject to court orders,  will follow the\n\ninstructions they receive.   Cf., e.g., Richardson  v. Marsh, 481\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 200, 206  (1987) (reiterating the \"invariable  assumption of\n\nthe law  that jurors follow  their instructions\").   We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that  the housing arrangement,  in and of  itself, did\n\nnot violate an existing sequestration order.\n\n          If  doubt inhered    and we see  no room for  any   two\n\nother considerations would then be decisive.  In the first place,\n\na district court's interpretation of its own order is customarily\n\naccorded great weight.  See, e.g., Witty v. Dukakis, 3  F.3d 517,\n                                                   \n\n521  (1st Cir.  1993); Martha's  Vineyard Scuba  Hqtrs., Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\n                                17\n\nUnidentified,  Wrecked &amp; Abandoned  Steam Vessel, 833  F.2d 1059,\n                                                \n\n1066-67 (1st  Cir. 1987); Lefkowitz  v. Fair, 816 F.2d  17, 22-23\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1987).  Here,  the district court ruled that congregant\n\nhousing of witnesses did not  infringe on the sequestration  that\n\nit decreed.  When a trial court's interpretation of its own order\n\ntracks plain language  and the  actual sequence  of events,  that\n\ninterpretation must be honored on appeal.\n\n          In  the  second place,  even  if  some implied  ban  on\n\ncongregant  housing of  prisoner-witnesses existed,  breach of  a\n\nsequestration order would not automatically call for a new trial;\n\nrather,  the need  for  a sanction,  and  the nature  of one,  if\n\nimposable,  are  matters  committed to  the  trial  court's sound\n\ndiscretion.  See United States v.  Rossetti, 768 F.2d 12, 16 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir.  1985); Arruda,  715 F.2d  at 684.   Appellants'  failure to\n                   \n\nrequest  a   broader  sequestration   order,  coupled  with   the\n\nspeculative nature of their claim of actual prejudice, renders it\n\nimpossible  to find  an abuse  of  discretion here.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nRossetti, 768 F.2d at 16.\n        \n\n          To  sum up,  our  search  of the  record  in this  case\n\ndiscloses  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  government or  its\n\nwitnesses  transgressed the existing sequestration order.  And as\n\nwe   have  indicated,  if  appellants  desired  a  more  vigorous\n\nsequestration  regime, such  as an  edict that would  have banned\n\ncohabitation or  other contact  amongst prisoner-witnesses,  they\n\nhad a  duty to ask for  it.  They failed  to do so.   Under these\n\ncircumstances,  the  district  court  appropriately  declined  to\n\n                                18\n\noverturn the  convictions.  See, e.g.,  De Jongh, 937  F.2d at 3;\n                                                \n\nRossetti, 768 F.2d  at 16; see also Langel v.  United States, 451\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 957, 963  (8th Cir. 1971) (determining that district court's\n\nrefusal  to  restrict  witnesses  from communicating  with  other\n\nwitnesses,  after some had  testified, did not  constitute error;\n\ndefendants made \"no  showing . . . that  Government witnesses did\n\ntalk to each other after testifying\").\n\nIV.  DISPUTES ANENT DISCOVERY\n\n          Appellants complain vociferously about the government's\n\nconduct during discovery.  The  complaints have a modest basis in\n\nfact.   Over the course  of this logistically complex  trial, the\n\ngovernment   produced  a  number  of  documents  in  a  seemingly\n\nlackadaisical  fashion.    On each  of  these  occasions, defense\n\ncounsel had to scramble in  order to assess the nascent discovery\n\nand integrate it into their  trial strategy.  On other occasions,\n\nthe  government refused to produce documents that defense counsel\n\nbelieved were  discoverable either  as exculpatory  material, see\n                                                                 \n\nBrady  v. Maryland,  373 U.S.  83, 87  (1963), or  as  fodder for\n                  \n\nimpeachment, see  Giglio v. United  States, 405 U.S.  150, 154-55\n                                          \n\n(1972);  see  also  18  U.S.C.     3500  (1988)   (requiring  the\n                  \n\ngovernment  to  disclose,  after  direct  testimony  and  on  the\n\ndefendant's   motion,  any  statement  by  the  witness,  in  the\n\ngovernment's  possession, that relates  to the subject  matter of\n\nthe  witness's  testimony).   We  discuss  these  two species  of\n\ndiscovery problems separately.\n\n                      A.  Delayed Discovery.\n                                           \n\n                                19\n\n          Prosecutors have  an obligation to  furnish exculpatory\n\nand  impeachment information to the defense  in a timely fashion.\n\nAlthough the  government's obligation goes beyond  the good-faith\n\nrequirement  of civil  discovery, see  United  States v.  Samalot\n                                                                 \n\nPerez,  767  F.2d  1, 4  (1st  Cir.  1985),  its  bounds are  not\n     \n\nlimitless.  Patrolling these boundaries is  primarily the duty of\n\nthe  nisi prius  court.   Because  the district  judge is  better\n               \n\nattuned to  the  nuances of  the trial,  this court  must take  a\n\ndeferential view of rulings made in the course of that patrol.\n\n          When discovery  material makes a belated  appearance, a\n\ncriminal  defendant  must  ordinarily seek  a  continuance  if he\n\nintends to claim prejudice.   A continuance affords time to study\n\nthe   newly   emergent   information,   consider   its   possible\n\nramifications, change trial  strategy (if necessary),  assess any\n\npotential   prejudice,  and  determine   how  best  to   use  the\n\ninformation.  As a general rule, a defendant who does not request\n\na  continuance will not  be heard to  complain on appeal  that he\n\nsuffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving discovery.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir. 1991);\n                             \n\nsee also  United States v.  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43,  47 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.)  (concluding, in an  analogous context, that  a defendant's\n\ncry of unfair surprise \"is  severely undermined, if not  entirely\n\nundone,  by  his  neglect  to   ask  the  district  court  for  a\n\ncontinuance to  meet the  claimed exigency\"),  cert. denied,  493\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 862 (1989).  Thus,  in situations where defense counsel does\n\nnot  seek  a  continuance upon  belated  receipt  of discoverable\n\n                                20\n\ninformation, a court  often can assume that counsel  did not need\n\nmore time to incorporate the information into the  defense's game\n\nplan.  See United States v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 413 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1986).\n\n          This general  rule spells  defeat for  the majority  of\n\nappellants' delayed  discovery claims.   In  every instance  save\n\none, appellants eschewed a request  for a continuance.  They have\n\nnever satisfactorily  explained how  delays in production  caused\n\nthem  any  cognizable harm  on  those several  occasions  and the\n\nrecord,  which  reflects  that  appellants  assimilated  the  new\n\nmaterial without  any  perceptible  hitch  and used  it  to  good\n\neffect,  belies  any  such  claim.    The  lack  of  demonstrable\n\nprejudice sounds the death knell for a \"delayed discovery\" claim.\n\nSee United States  v. Devin, 918  F.2d 280, 290  (1st Cir.  1990)\n                           \n\n(explaining that  a defendant  who complains  about tardiness  in\n\ndisclosure  \"cannot rely on wholly conclusory assertions but must\n\nbear the burden of  producing, at the  very least, a prima  facie\n                                                                 \n\nshowing  of  a   plausible  strategic  option  which   the  delay\n\nforeclosed\").    Hence,  we  find  appellants' delayed  discovery\n\nclaims, with one exception, to have been waived.\n\n          The   facts   referable  to   the   remaining  dilatory\n\ndisclosure  claim can be  succinctly summarized.   Perez not only\n\nworked as a  courier for David Sepulveda, but  also supported his\n\nown cocaine  habit by peddling  drugs.  After he  was apprehended\n\nfor selling cocaine,  Perez agreed to testify  against appellants\n\nin  return for  the United  States Attorney's  help in  seeking a\n\n                                21\n\nreduced sentence.   Since Perez was the only witness who tied all\n\nthe  defendants  to  David Sepulveda's  illicit  enterprise,  his\n\ntestimony was extremely important to the government's case.\n\n          When  defense lawyers  began cross-examining  Perez, it\n\nbecame  apparent that  the  FBI  records  furnished  in  pretrial\n\ndiscovery  did not  list Perez's  entire  repertoire of  criminal\n\nconvictions,   especially  those   stemming   from  state   court\n\nproceedings and not reported to the FBI.  When Perez acknowledged\n\nthat a state probation officer had prepared a presentence  report\n\nfor a New Hampshire court,  appellants asked for a continuance so\n\nthat  they might  obtain  this document  and more  fully research\n\nPerez's  criminal history.  The  district court denied the motion\n\nbut offered  to permit  the defense to  recall Perez  for further\n\ncross-questioning should  the new  information warrant  it.   The\n\ntrial continued coincident  with the defense's efforts  to secure\n\nthe presentence report.\n\n          After some travail, New Hampshire authorities agreed to\n\nrelease the report to  the federal court in camera.  The district\n                                                  \n\njudge  found  that it  contained  little  fresh material  but  he\n\nnonetheless issued  a turnover order.   The defense  received the\n\nreport while  Perez was still  on the  witness stand.   The judge\n\nrefused to grant a mistrial  or afford appellants any  comparable\n\nredress.\n\n          We see no error.  The  prosecution was caught unawares;\n\nit never knew of the report's existence and, therefore, could not\n\nhave deliberately withheld it.   Furthermore, the rigors of Brady\n                                                                 \n\n                                22\n\ndo  not   usually  attach   to  material   outside  the   federal\n\ngovernment's  control   and the presentence  report at issue here\n\nfalls within  the scope  of this generality.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Aichele, 941  F.2d 761, 764  (9th Cir.  1991) (holding\n                  \n\nthat  a  federal  prosecutor had  no  duty  to  procure materials\n\nprepared  for  the state  courts which  were not  otherwise under\n\nfederal control).\n\n          Last,  but far  from least,  delayed  disclosure claims\n\ncannot  succeed  unless  the   aggrieved  defendant  demonstrates\n\nprejudice arising  from the delay.   See  Devin, 918 F.2d  at 290\n                                               \n\n(refusing  to  reverse  conviction  where delayed  disclosure  of\n\nimpeachment  material  \"had no  effect  on  the  outcome  of  the\n\ntrial\"); Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 411-12 (stating  that the critical\n                 \n\ntest \"is whether defendant's  counsel was prevented by the  delay\n\nfrom  using the disclosed  material effectively in  preparing and\n\npresenting  the defendant's case\").  Here, however, the defense's\n\ndelayed receipt of the report did not hinder cross-examination to\n\nany appreciable degree.  From  the start of trial, appellants had\n\na  sizeable storehouse of data concerning Perez's checkered past.\n\nIn comparison  to  what  was  already known,  the  report,  which\n\nyielded  a  relatively  inconsequential   amount  of  incremental\n\ninformation, comprised small  potatoes.  Moreover, the  timing of\n\nevents  minimized  the  possibility  of  prejudice.    Appellants\n\nreceived the report while Perez  was still testifying.  They were\n\nable to incorporate its contents into their cross-examination and\n\nemploy the information effectively.   For aught that appears, the\n\n                                23\n\ncourse  and outcome  of the  trial would  have  been the  same no\n\nmatter when the report surfaced.\n\n          In  our  view,  the  presider's  decision  to  allow  a\n\ncriminal case to  go forward, notwithstanding delayed  disclosure\n\nof  material relevant  to  impeachment of  a  witness, should  be\n\nupheld unless a  manifest abuse of discretion looms.   See Devin,\n                                                                \n\n918 F.2d at  289.  On this  record, we can neither  criticize the\n\ndistrict court's exercise  of its informed discretion  nor tamper\n\nwith the court's  bipartite finding that the  government violated\n\nno  duty  and  that,  in   any  event,  appellants  sustained  no\n\ncognizable  prejudice  arising out  of  the  presentence report's\n\nbelated emergence.\n\n                      B.  Denied Discovery.\n                                          \n\n          Appellants  also complain  that the court  below, after\n\nscrutinizing  certain materials in camera, denied their motion to\n                                         \n\ncompel discovery.   The materials in question consist  of various\n\npolice files, including interview notes.   We have reviewed these\n\nmaterials and  agree with the  lower court that they  are outside\n\nthe purview of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.   3500, for two reasons.\n\nFirst,  to be  discoverable  under the  Jencks Act,  a government\n\nrecord of a  witness interview must  be substantially a  verbatim\n\naccount.  See United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d  944, 953-54 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1989).   Second,  the  account  must  have been  signed  or\n\notherwise verified by the witness  himself.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nGonzalez-Sanchez,  825 F.2d 572, 586-87 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n484 U.S. 989 (1987).  The  police files at issue here,  including\n\n                                24\n\nthe interview notes,  do not meet either of  these guidelines and\n\nare, therefore, non-discoverable.  A fortiori, the district court\n                                             \n\ndid not blunder in denying access to them.\n\nV.  COCONSPIRATORS' STATEMENTS\n\n          During the course  of trial, the judge  allowed several\n\nwitnesses to  attribute out-of-court  statements to  one or  more\n\ndeclarants,   finding,  inter  alia,  that  the  declarants  were\n                                   \n\ncoconspirators.  Appellants assign error.\n\n          Although out-of-court statements made by non-testifying\n\ndeclarants ordinarily are excluded as hearsay if offered to prove\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted, see Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), there\n                                     \n\nare exceptions  to the rule.  One such exception provides that \"a\n\nstatement by a coconspirator of a  party during the course and in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy\" is  not hearsay.   Fed.  R. Evid\n\n801(d)(2)(E).   To  invoke the  exception, a  party who  wants to\n\nintroduce  a particular statement must show by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that  a conspiracy embracing both  the declarant and\n\nthe  defendant  existed,  and  that  the  declarant  uttered  the\n\nstatement  during and  in  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBourjaily  v.

The party at whom the evidence is aimed must\n\nobject to the statement when it is offered; and,  if the district\n\ncourt accepts  the evidence de bene,  must then ask  the court at\n                                   \n\nthe close of  all the relevant evidence to  strike the statement,\n\ni.e., to consider  whether the proponent fulfilled  the requisite\n    \n\nfoundational requirements  by  a preponderance  of the  evidence.\n\n                                25\n\nSee Ortiz,  966 F.2d at 715;  United States v.

See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMcCarthy, 961  F.2d 972,  977 (1st Cir.  1992); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nCresta, 825 F.2d 538, 551 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n1042 (1988).\n\n          We  begin  by  considering three  pieces  of  testimony\n\nrecounting out-of-court statements.  The common thread that joins\n\nthese proffers is that the government adduced some other evidence\n\ntending   to   prove   that  the   declarants   were,   in  fact,\n\ncoconspirators.  We then address two pieces of testimony that are\n\nnot cushioned in a comparable fashion.\n\n                    A.  Supported Statements.\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     11On a sixth occasion, defendant Driesse objected to another\nstatement.   Inasmuch as that statement implicated Driesse alone,\nwe regard the  ensuing assignment of error as beyond the scope of\nthis opinion.  See supra note 2.\n                        \n\n                                26\n\n          1.     Milne  Testimony.     Milne  (a   self-confessed\n          1.     Milne  Testimony.\n                                 \n\ncoconspirator) served as  the wellspring of the  first statement.\n\nHe testified  that a defendant,  Edward Welch, told him  that the\n\npolice  noticed cocaine  on his  (Welch's) bed  in the  course of\n\nexecuting a  search warrant.   The district court found  that the\n\ndeclarant, Welch, was a coconspirator, and that Welch's statement\n\nwas  made during  and  in  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.   The\n\nfinding is fully sustainable.\n\n          Both Coriaty and  Milne testified that Welch  sold them\n\ncocaine he  had purchased  from David  Sepulveda (an  arrangement\n\nthat  numerous  other  witnesses  corroborated).   This  evidence\n\nencourages,  if it  does not  demand, the  conclusion  that Welch\n\nworked hand  in glove with  Sepulveda.   A pattern of  drug sales\n\nbetween  two individuals, looking toward resale to third persons,\n\ntogether  with  appropriate  contextual  detail,  can  support  a\n\nfinding that the two individuals were jointly involved in a drug-\n\ntrafficking conspiracy.   See  United States  v. Moran,  984 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855,\n                                                  \n\n857-58  (1st  Cir. 1987).    The  record likewise  justifies  the\n\nconclusion that Welch's statements to Milne were made  during and\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy.  We think it is common ground  \n\nand common  sense   that  the reporting of significant  events by\n\none coconspirator to another advances the conspiracy.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Smith, 833 F.2d 213, 219 (10th Cir. 1987).\n               \n\n          2.  Rice  Testimony.  Another government  witness, John\n          2.  Rice  Testimony.\n                             \n\nRice, testified  that one  defendant, Driesse,  mentioned that  a\n\n                                27\n\nsecond  defendant, Rood, sold cocaine for the Sepulveda brothers.\n\nThe jury  found both  Driesse and Rood  guilty of  the conspiracy\n\ncharge,  and the  record gives  considerable  definition to  both\n\nmen's links to the drug ring.   And, moreover, since the  sharing\n\nof pertinent information  about a conspiracy's mode  of operation\n\nfurthers  the conspiratorial ends,  see United States  v. Munson,\n                                                                \n\n819 F.2d 337, 341 (1st Cir. 1987), Driesse's statement concerning\n\ndrug sales  assisted the  charged conspiracy  by informing  other\n\ncoconspirators of Rood's role and activities.\n\n          3.    Malone Testimony.    A  third statement  came  in\n          3.    Malone Testimony.\n                                \n\nthrough  a police  officer, Kathy  Malone, who  made a  number of\n\nundercover  buys from Sepulveda-supplied  vendors.  She testified\n\nthat David Sepulveda's inamorata, Bambi Burley, told her that she\n\n(Bambi) had  jilted Sepulveda and  asked whether Malone  might be\n\n\"one of those girls that went to  New York with him.\"  Appellants\n\nchallenge the admission of this statement on the sole ground that\n\nBurley,  herself, was  a  stranger  to  the  charged  conspiracy.\n\nHowever,  this  challenge  overlooks  Perez's testimony  that  he\n\ncollected drug debts for David  Sepulveda and delivered the money\n\nto  Burley.   While  there  is  hardly  a profusion  of  evidence\n\ndepicting Burley as a coconspirator, there is enough to withstand\n\nclear error review.12\n\n                    \n\n     12It seems  problematic whether  these statements  furthered\nthe  conspiracy.   We need  not mull  this question,  however, as\nappellants did not advance this  ground either in the lower court\nor in their briefs.  The issue is, therefore, waived.  See United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1992).  In all events,\n               \nthe statements seem harmless.\n\n                                28\n\n                   B.  Unsupported Statements.\n                                             \n\n          The two additional  instances in which the  court below\n\nadmitted  statements  under the  coconspirator  exception despite\n\ncontemporaneous objection are  qualitatively different.  In  each\n\ninstance, there appears to be  no record evidence, other than the\n\nstatement itself, to support its admissibility.\n\n          One statement arose during the government's examination\n\nof  a police  detective, Mark  Putney.   The detective  testified\n\nthat, while executing a search  warrant at a dwelling occupied by\n\ndefendant Cheryl Johnson and her  husband, Brian, he answered the\n\ntelephone:\n\n          The  male caller asked if  Brian was home.  I\n          stated  I was Brian.   The caller  stated did\n          you pick  up the stuff.   I said I did.   The\n          caller asked if  he could come over  and pick\n          up a half.  I stated sure, come on over.\n\n          The other statement occurred  during direct examination\n\nof  Joseph  Baranski.    Baranski  testified  that  he  sometimes\n\nprovided  transportation for  people going  to David  Sepulveda's\n\nhouse and that,  on occasion, his passengers would  tell him that\n\nthey were  visiting Sepulveda  because \"they  wanted to  buy some\n\ndrugs.\"\n\n          Our  review of the  record has deterrated  no extrinsic\n\nevidence  tending to show that these out-of-court declarants (the\n\nunidentified caller to the Johnson residence and the unidentified\n\npassengers   in  Baranski's   vehicle)  were   involved  in   the\n\nconspiracy, and the government has  directed us to no such proof.\n\nFollowing  the Supreme Court's landmark opinion in Bourjaily, and\n                                                            \n\n                                29\n\nJustice Stevens's concurrence, 483 U.S.  at 185 &amp; n.2, several of\n\nour  sister circuits  have concluded  that  the preponderance  of\n\nevidence  required  for  the   introduction  of  an  out-of-court\n\nstatement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) must  necessarily comprise more\n\nthan  the weight  of the  statement  itself.

See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nDworken, 855 F.2d 12, 25 (1st Cir. 1988) (deferring resolution).\n       \n\n          This case presents the issue squarely and requires that\n\nwe decide it.  We hold that a coconspirator's statement, standing\n\nalone, is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard of Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E).   In  other words,  to  satisfy the  weight-of-the-\n\nevidence criteria for that hearsay exception, there must be  some\n\nproof  aliunde.    Though  the  district  court  may  consider  a\n              \n\nstatement's  contents   and  the   circumstances  attending   its\n\nutterance  when gauging  the statement's reliability,  see United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Gomez-Pabon, 911  F.2d 847, 856  n.3 (1st  Cir. 1990),\n                      \n\ncert. denied,  498 U.S. 1074 (1991), admitting the statement into\n            \n\nevidence  requires  some  extrinsic   proof  of  the  declarant's\n\ninvolvement  in the  conspiracy.   Thus,  because the  government\n\ndeveloped  no independent evidence of who Brian Johnson's callers\n\n                                30\n\nor Joseph  Baranski's passengers might  have been, or  what their\n\nstatus  might have  been vis-a-vis  the  charged conspiracy,  the\n\nstatements  were  improperly  admitted  under  the  coconspirator\n\nexception to the hearsay rule.13\n\n          There   is  no  bright-line   rule  for  divining  when\n\nparticular errors that  result in a  jury's exposure to  improper\n\nevidence are  (or  are not)  harmless.   Rather,  a  harmlessness\n\ndetermination   demands   a  panoramic,   case-specific   inquiry\n\nconsidering,  among other things,  the centrality of  the tainted\n\nmaterial, its  uniqueness, its  prejudicial impact,  the uses  to\n\nwhich it was put during the trial, the relative  strengths of the\n\nparties'  cases,  and any  telltales  that furnish  clues  to the\n\nlikelihood that the error affected the factfinder's resolution of\n\na  material issue.   Gearing  our inquiry  along these  lines, we\n\nconclude that the errors in admitting  the statements are benign.\n\nThe  telephone  talk  concerned a  peripheral  matter,  for Brian\n\nJohnson  was  not  on  trial.    Furthermore,  several  witnesses\n\ntestified at first  hand that his  wife and housemate,  appellant\n\nCheryl Johnson,  trafficked in  cocaine.   See supra  Part II(D).\n                                                    \n\nThe passengers'  remarks constituted cumulative  evidence.   They\n\n                    \n\n     13We  do not mean to imply  that the evidence might not have\nbeen introduced for  some other purpose.   Suppose, for  example,\nthat the telephone calls Putney received were not offered to show\nthat someone in fact sought to buy drugs from Brian Johnson, but,\nrather,  to  show  the  types  of telephone  calls  the  Johnsons\nreceived.  If admissible on  that basis, the statements would not\nbe excludable as  hearsay.  See  Fed. R. Evid.  801(c); see  also\n                                                                 \nUnited  States  v.

Several  of these witnesses swore that\n\nthey  personally purchased drugs  from him.   Against  this tidal\n\nwave  of  evidence,  Baranski's  testimony  was  a  drop  in  the\n\nproverbial bucket.   Because  the record  offers every  assurance\n\nthat  the errant statements  did not affect  the trial's outcome,\n\nthey were harmless.14  See  United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d  954,\n                                                 \n\n957-58 (1st Cir. 1989); Dworken, 855 F.2d at 26.\n                               \n\nVI.  EXPERT TESTIMONY\n\n          At  trial,  the  government's  case culminated  in  the\n\ntestimony of Commander  Richard Gerry of  the New Hampshire  Drug\n\nTask Force.   Before  Commander Gerry  testified, the  prosecutor\n\ntold the  court that Gerry's views would  be based upon the trial\n\ntestimony and his experience  as a police officer,  and predicted\n\nthat Gerry would \"explain to the jury how the quantities of drugs\n\n. . . referred to in the . . . testimony at trial [were] used and\n\ndistributed  . .  . from  the business  aspect.\"   Based  on this\n\nrepresentation, the court denied appellants' motion in limine and\n                                                             \n\npermitted the witness to testify. \n\n                    \n\n     14Appellants  also assign error to four statements that were\nadmitted without objection.  Absent a showing of plain error, the\nfailure  to object  below  is  fatal  to claims  that  particular\nevidence should not have reached  the jury.  See Ortiz,  966 F.2d\n                                                      \nat 715; Perkins, 926 F.2d at 1283; see also Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).\n                                           \nWe find  no plain error in  connection with the admission  of the\nfour  statements; their introduction, whether viewed singly or in\ncombination, did not  \"seriously affect the fundamental  fairness\nand basic integrity  of the [trial],\"  United States v.  Griffin,\n                                                                \n818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844  (1987),\n                                          \nor otherwise impair appellants' substantial rights.\n\n                                32\n\n          In  the initial stages, the testimony went according to\n\nplan:  Commander  Gerry discussed the ways in  which drug dealers\n\ncommonly package their products and reviewed the economics of the\n\ncocaine trade (illustrating the profit to be gained by buying and\n\nselling  in various quantities).   Despite this  promising start,\n\nmatters  soon deteriorated.    Although Commander  Gerry  offered\n\nopinions   as   to   appellants'   roles   in   the   enterprise,\n\ncharacterizing David  Sepulveda as  \"top dog\"  and the  others as\n\nrank-and-file  members  of  the  organization,  cross-examination\n\nrevealed that  these opinions  were less the  fruit of  an expert\n\nmind  attuned to  the  testimony in  the case  than the  yield of\n\nundifferentiated conversations over  the years with  unidentified\n\npolice  officers  regarding  Sepulveda and  his  associates.   So\n\ningrained were  the roots of  Commander Gerry's opinions  that he\n\nwas unable to specify the sources  of his information or, in  the\n\nend, articulate a plausible basis for his views.  The speculative\n\nnature  of Gerry's  testimony became  starkly  apparent when  the\n\ndefense established that he had heard only bits and pieces of the\n\ntestimony  in the  case.   These rather  startling insights  cast\n\ngrave doubt  upon both  the adequacy of  the foundation  on which\n\nGerry's testimony rested  and the existence of a fair opportunity\n\nfor effective cross-questioning.\n\n          Midway through  cross-examination the defense  moved to\n\nstrike  the  expert's  testimony in  toto.    The district  court\n                                         \n\ngranted  the  motion.   We  think  the  defects in  the  expert's\n\npresentation warranted this step.   Fed. R. Evid. 705 provides in\n\n                                33\n\npertinent part  that an expert witness \"may .  . . be required to\n\ndisclose  [on cross-examination] the underlying facts or data\" on\n\nwhich  his opinions rest.   If cross-examination reveals that the\n\nopinions  advanced  by  an  expert rest  on  a  wholly inadequate\n\nfoundation,  the  judge,   on  timely  motion,  may   strike  the\n\ntestimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Scop, 846 F.2d 135,  142-\n                                            \n\n43 (2d Cir. 1988); Benjamin  v. Peter's Farm Condo.

Appellants  neither objected to  its form nor\n\nsought to have the judge improve upon it.  The next day, however,\n\nappellants moved  for a mistrial.   The judge denied  the motion.\n\nOn appeal, appellants  lament the denial  of both their  original\n\nmotion in limine and their subsequent motion for a mistrial.\n                \n\n                    A.

Because  gauging  an  expert witness's\n                        \n\nusefulness  is almost  always a  case-specific  inquiry, the  law\n\naffords trial  judges substantial  discretion in  connection with\n\nthe admission or  exclusion of opinion evidence.

It follows that a trial judge's rulings\n\nin  this sphere should  be upheld \"unless  manifestly erroneous.\"\n\nSalem v. United  States Lines Co.,  370 U.S.  31, 35 (1962);  see\n                                                                 \n\nalso Hoffman, 832  F.2d at  1310 (explaining  that \"the  district\n            \n\ncourt's assessment of what  will or will not  assist the jury  is\n\nentitled to considerable deference in the Rule 702 milieu\").\n\n          Given the government's  preliminary proffer, there  was\n\nno need for outright exclusion of the anticipated testimony.  The\n\nSupreme Court has recently reaffirmed that when a  party proffers\n\nan  expert,  the  trial judge  performs  a  gatekeeping function,\n\ndetermining  whether  it  is reasonably  likely  that  the expert\n\npossesses specialized  knowledge  which  will  assist  the  trier\n\nbetter to understand a fact in issue.  See Daubert v. Merrell Dow\n                                                                 \n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc.,  113  S.  Ct.  2786,  2796  (1993).

If\n\nCommander  Gerry's pedagogy  proved  to  be  as  advertised,  his\n\ntestimony  arguably would have assisted the jury in understanding\n\nthe   voluminous  evidence   that  had   emerged.     Experienced\n\ninvestigators are  commonly permitted  to testify  as experts  on\n\ntopics  such  as the  structure  of  a  criminal enterprise,  the\n\neconomics  of the  drug trade,  and the  handling of  contraband.\n\n                                35\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

But  although\n                       \nappellants moved  in limine  to forfend  Gerry's testimony,  they\n                           \napparently never sought permission to conduct a voir dire.\n                                                         \n\n                                36\n\n          Appellants'  next   assignment  of  error   presents  a\n\nslightly closer  question.   Although the  district court  struck\n\nCommander Gerry's half-completed testimony and told the jurors to\n\ndisregard what they had heard,  appellants assert that the  court\n\nerred  in  refusing  to  grant  a  mistrial.    At  the  core  of\n\nappellants' argument lies their insistence that  the judge did no\n\nmore  than hold a farthing candle to  the sun; once Gerry's views\n\nwere aired,  words from the  bench, no matter how  stentorian the\n\njudge's tone, could not exorcise the resultant prejudice.\n\n          Granting or denying a motion for a mistrial is a matter\n\ncommitted to  the trial  court's discretion.   See De  Jongh, 937\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 3; United  States v.

The exercise  of  that\n             \n\ndiscretion always  must be informed  by the circumstances  of the\n\nparticular case.   When, as now, a  motion to declare  a mistrial\n\nhas its genesis in a claim that improper evidence came before the\n\njury, the court must first weigh the claim of impropriety and, if\n\nthat claim is well founded, strike the offending evidence.  Next,\n\nunless   the  court  believes  that  the  evidence  is  seriously\n\nprejudicial   and  that  a   curative  instruction  will   be  an\n\ninsufficient  antidote, the court  should proceed with  the trial\n\nafter instructing the jury to disregard the  evidence.  Declaring\n\na mistrial is  a last resort, only to be implemented if the taint\n\nis ineradicable, that  is, only if the trial  judge believes that\n\nthe jury's  exposure to  the evidence is  likely to  prove beyond\n\nrealistic hope of repair.\n\n                                37\n\n          In this  instance, Judge  Devine followed the  standard\n\nparadigm as closely as possible, considering appellants' delay in\n\noffering the mistrial motion.   Three factors persuade us that he\n\nhandled  the situation in  an appropriate manner.   First, courts\n\nhave long recognized that, within wide margins, the potential for\n\nprejudice stemming  from improper  testimony or  comments can  be\n\nsatisfactorily  dispelled by  appropriate curative  instructions.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.  Figueroa, 900 F.2d 1211,  1216 (8th\n                                      \n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  496  U.S.  942  (1990); United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nFerreira,  821 F.2d  1, 5-6  (1st  Cir. 1987);  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCirrincione, 780 F.2d 620, 635 (7th Cir. 1985).  The instructions\n           \n\ngiven here pass  the test of appropriateness;  indeed, appellants\n\nhave  not  suggested  any  way  in which  they  might  have  been\n\nimproved.\n\n          Second, Judge  Devine did  not allow  sores to  fester.\n\nRather,  he halted Commander  Gerry's testimony in  midstream and\n\ninstructed the jurors to discard  the faulty evidence.  Swiftness\n\nin  judicial  response  is an  important  element  in alleviating\n\nprejudice once the  jury has been exposed  to improper testimony.\n\nSee,  e.g., United  States v.  Pryor, 960 F.2d  1, 2-3  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992); United  States v. Hernandez,  891 F.2d 521, 523  (5th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989), cert.  denied, 495 U.S.  909 (1990).   In  this case,  the\n                    \n\njudge could scarcely have acted more celeritously.\n\n          Third,    appellate   courts    inquiring   into    the\n\neffectiveness  of  a trial  judge's curative  instructions should\n\nstart  with  a  presumption  that jurors  will  follow  a  direct\n\n                                38\n\ninstruction  to disregard  matters  improvidently brought  before\n\nthem.  See  United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1781 (1993);\n                                  \n\nRichardson, 481 U.S.  at 206.  Though rebuttable, the presumption\n          \n\nendures  unless it appears  probable that, in  a particular case,\n\nresponsible jurors will not  be able to put the testimony  to one\n\nside, and, moreover, that the testimony  will likely be seriously\n\nprejudicial to the aggrieved party.   See United States v. Paiva,\n                                                                \n\n892 F.2d 148, 160 (1st Cir. 1989) (collecting cases).\n\n          Read as a whole,  Commander Gerry's partially completed\n\ntestimony does  not strike  us as so  compelling that  its impact\n\nwould linger  even  after  the  court's stern  admonition.    The\n\ntestimony is virtually  indistinguishable from the vast  array of\n\nother  evidence introduced by the prosecution, and, therefore, it\n\nis  of  the  cumulative  vintage.16    We  have  routinely  found\n\ncumulative evidence  impotent when  accidentally uncorked.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385, 393 (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 201 (1991); United States v. Morris, 700  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n427, 431 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 947 (1983).  So it is\n                                 \n\nhere.   Appellants have not successfully rebutted the presumption\n\nthat the jury heeded the judge's instructions.\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to save the day, appellants come\n\nat the question  of undue prejudice from a  slightly more oblique\n\n                    \n\n     16It  is,  perhaps,  worth noting  that  the  only defendant\ndiscussed in  any detail by the  witness was David Sepulveda    a\ndefendant   as  to  whom  the  prosecution  adduced  overwhelming\nevidence of  guilt.  We  add that, although there  were different\nquanta of evidence as to  each defendant, a painstaking review of\nthe  record inspires  confidence that  Gerry's  testimony had  no\nsignificant spillover effect vis-a-vis other defendants.\n\n                                39\n\nangle.     They  allege  that  the  government's  questioning  of\n\nCommander Gerry went  so far beyond the limits  of propriety that\n\nputting  him on  the  witness  stand  amounted  to  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.    But  the  record  simply  does  not  support  this\n\naccusation.  The government  had a reasonable basis for  offering\n\nGerry as an expert  witness.  Although  the decision did not  pan\n\nout, that is no  reason to consign either  the prosecutor or  the\n\nprosecution to the juridical equivalent of  philotheoparoptesism.\n\nLike judges,  prosecutors cannot be  held to a standard  of utter\n\nprescience.17 \n\n          For these reasons, we discern no abuse of discretion in\n\neither  the  district  court's  initial  admission  of  Commander\n\nGerry's  testimony or the  court's refusal to  declare a mistrial\n\nafter  the  necessity  to  strike  the testimony  arose.    In  a\n\nnutshell, there was no reason to  believe that the infelicitously\n\noffered evidence  remained  in the  jurors'  minds after  it  was\n\nbanished from the case, and,  consequently, no need for the court\n\nto jettison the baby when the bath water turned tepid.\n\nVII.  CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\n          Appellants  contend  that   the  prosecutors'  comments\n\n                    \n\n     17Moreover,  if blame  is to  be  assigned, appellants  must\nshare in it.  They could have,  but did not, ask for a voir dire.\n                                                                \nSee supra note 15.   A party who elects not to  request voir dire\n                                                                 \nof an opponent's  expert runs certain risks.   When a predictable\nrisk materializes,  there is little  incentive for  courts to  be\nsympathetic.    Cf., e.g.,  Paterson-Leitch Co.  v. Massachusetts\n                                                                 \nMun.  Wholesale Elec.  Co., 840  F.2d  985, 989  (1st Cir.  1988)\n                          \n(\"Courts, like the Deity, are most frequently moved to help those\nwho help themselves.\").\n\n                                40\n\nduring closing argument constituted reversible error because some\n\nstatements spotlighted appellants' joint  decision not to testify\n\nand others  unfairly inflamed  the jury's  passions.18   Although\n\nthese  contentions  are   obviously  related,  we  analyze   them\n\nseparately.\n\n               A.  Comments on Defendants' Silence.\n                                                  \n\n          We begin with bedrock.  The Fifth Amendment forbids any\n\ncomment  by the  prosecutor on  the defendant's  exercise of  the\n\nright  to remain silent.  See United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n25, 30 (1988);  Griffin v. California, 380 U.S.  609, 615 (1965).\n                                     \n\nThe proposition is more easily stated than applied.   There is no\n\nbright line marking the precipice between a legitimate assessment\n\nof defense witnesses  and an impermissible encroachment  upon the\n\naccused's silence.  Prosecutors who choose to explore such rugged\n\nterrain must  take particular care  not to comment upon,  or call\n\nthe  jury's  attention to,  a  defendant's  failure  to take  the\n\nwitness stand.  See  United States v.  Lavoie, 721 F.2d 407,  408\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.  1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S.  1069 (1984); Rodriguez-\n                                                                 \n\nSandoval v. United States, 409 F.2d 529, 531 (1st Cir. 1969).\n                         \n\n          Nonetheless, the road runs in both directions,  leading\n\nto a  rough mutuality  of obligation.   Defense attorneys  have a\n\nresponsibility to  exercise reasonable  vigilance and direct  the\n\ntrial court's immediate  attention to perceived trespasses.

See id.  In this  way, the prosecution can\n                              \n\nclarify  ambiguities and correct mislocutions in a timely manner,\n\nand,  if necessary, the  trial judge can  administer an immediate\n\nantidote, thereby curtailing any damage.\n\n          None of the appellants chose to testify at trial.  Yet,\n\nthe prosecutors courted trouble in both segments of their closing\n\nargument.  Initially, one of them asked rhetorically:\n\n          Did anyone come  into this courtroom and  say\n          what the Government witnesses told you didn't\n          happen?    Did  they?    They   attacked  the\n          witnesses, the DEA, the police officers, [and\n          the government attorneys]. . . .\n\nOn rebuttal, her colleague expanded upon (and twice repeated) the\n\nsame theme:\n\n          The  United   States  introduced  a   lot  of\n          evidence during  this trial, a  lot of facts.\n          And for the  most part, there is  no evidence\n          in  this case to show that what our witnesses\n          said happened did  not happen.  That  is, the\n          defendants  have  done little  or  nothing to\n          refute that evidence.\n\n                                42\n\n                       *        *        *\n\n          Ladies  and   gentlemen,  we  stand   on  the\n          evidence,  the  overwhelming   evidence,  the\n          evidence  which,  for  the   most  part,  the\n          defendants  have done  absolutely nothing  to\n          refute . . . .\n\nIt was only  after the jury had  been dismissed for the  day that\n\nappellants, having sat  silently throughout both segments  of the\n\nprosecutors'  summations, moved for  a mistrial based  in part on\n\nthe  quoted statements.   The  trial court  denied the  motion as\n\nuntimely and sent the case to the  jury the next morning.  In the\n\ncourse  of  the charge,  Judge  Devine  stated on  five  separate\n\noccasions  that the government  was responsible for  carrying the\n\nburden  of proof,  that the  defendants had  the right  to remain\n\nsilent,  and  that  no  inferences   might  be  drawn  from   the\n\ndefendants' election not to testify.19\n\n          In  assaying  the  appropriateness  of  a  prosecutor's\n\nremarks,  context  frequently  determines meaning.    See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

Once the prosecutor's\n     \n\nwords are  placed in context,  we inquire  whether \"the  language\n\nused was  manifestly intended or  was of such character  that the\n\njury  would naturally and necessarily take  it to be a comment on\n\n                    \n\n     19To be sure, the judge did not specifically direct the jury\nto disregard the comments quoted above.

The  government's closing  argument\n\nrecounted  the  evidence   against  each  defendant  and,   while\n\nadmitting that  certain prosecution witnesses  possessed unsavory\n\nreputations  and might  profit  by cooperation,  the  prosecutors\n\nurged the jury to find that those witnesses testified truthfully.\n\nNot  surprisingly,  defense  counsels' summations  played  up the\n\n                    \n\n     20In  this case,  the  district  court  apparently  did  not\nbelieve  that  the  prosecutors  intended  the  statements  as  a\nreflection on the  defendants' failure to testify  and appellants\nhave not imputed so malign a motive  to the prosecution team.  We\nfocus,  therefore,  on  what  the   jury  might  have  taken  the\nstatements to imply.\n\n                                44\n\ncredibility theme, systematically  besmirching the reliability of\n\nthe government's  witnesses, stressing  internal inconsistencies,\n\nand  outlining  perceived  conflicts  between  the  testimony  of\n\ndifferent witnesses.  Throughout, counsel paraded the cooperating\n\nwitnesses' criminal records  past the jury and made  much of what\n\nthose  witnesses  stood  to  gain  by  currying  favor  with  the\n\nauthorities.\n\n          Visualized   against  this   backdrop,  and   assigning\n\nordinary  words their  most  natural  meaning, the  prosecution's\n\nargument  that   the  defense   had  not   successfully  rebutted\n\nincriminating  evidence seems not to be  a comment on appellants'\n\nfailure to  testify but  a comment about  the credibility  of the\n\ngovernment's case.  Arguments of this stripe do not trespass upon\n\nthe accused's  right to remain silent.   See Lockett v.

Within  the bounds  of  fair play  and due  process,\n\nprosecutors are not barred from making powerful arguments.\n\n          To be sure, it is  conceivable that a juror hearing the\n\nprosecutors' words might have interpreted them as a commentary on\n\n                                45\n\nappellants' joint decision not to  testify.  But we cannot decide\n\nthis case  based on what amounts  to a doomsday scenario.   After\n\nall,  an  appellate court  is  not at  liberty  to \"infer  that a\n\nprosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have  its most damaging\n\nmeaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will\n\ndraw   that  meaning   from  the   plethora   of  less   damaging\n\ninterpretations.\"  Lilly, 983 F.2d at 307 (citation omitted); see\n                                                                 \n\nalso  Robinson, 485  U.S. at  31 (explaining  \"that an  appellate\n              \n\ncourt may [not] substitute its reading of ambiguous language  for\n\nthat of the trial court\").  We are particularly unwilling to fish\n\nin  the   pool  of  ambiguity   where  the  defendants   did  not\n\ncontemporaneously object or otherwise bring the  district court's\n\nattention to  any potentially harmful  circumlocution during  the\n\nsummations.   Hence,  we  rule  that  the  prosecutors'  lack-of-\n\nrefutation references did not require a mistrial.\n\n                   B.

The ancient adage applies:  what is sauce\n\nfor the  government's goose often may  prove to be sauce  for the\n\ndefendants' gander.\n\n          Although we  deplore frank  appeals to  passion of  the\n\nsort  typified by \"war  on drugs\"  rhetoric, see,  e.g., Arrieta-\n                                                                 \n\nAgressot, 3 F.3d at 527, we regard it as settled  that references\n        \n\nto law enforcement efforts are not forbidden in summation if such\n\nreferences are  incited  or invited  by,  or fairly  respond  to,\n\ndefendants' closing  statements.  See,  e.g., Smith, 918  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n1563; United States v.  Brown, 887 F.2d 537, 542 (5th Cir. 1989);\n                             \n\nMachor,  879 F.2d at  956;   United States  v. Bascaro,  742 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1335,  1353-54 (11th  Cir.  1984), cert.  denied,  472 U.S.  1017\n                                                \n\n(1985).  Though  there may well be exceptions to  this rule,24 no\n\nsuch exceptions  lie for cases  like this one    cases  where the\n\ndysphemisms are  few in number, do not escalate the level of fire\n\n                    \n\n     24We  have, for instance, warned prosecutors that \"there are\nlimits  to the  extent that  we  will permit  fighting fire  with\nfire.\"   Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274.  Merely because a defense\n                     \nattorney opens the  door does not mean that a prosecutor can come\nstorming through it in a pair of hobnailed boots.\n\n                                49\n\nand  brimstone that characterized  the defense's oratory,  and do\n\nnot provoke  a contemporaneous objection.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1285 (1st Cir. 1993); Mejia-Lozano, 829\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 274.\n\n          3.

Discouraging  Sympathy.\n                                      \n\nreasons, we  find the  final challenged  statement, quoted  supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote  23,  to fall  within the  pale.   Viewed  in  context, this\n\nstatement,  which questioned whether an acquittal out of sympathy\n\nwould  be in  the  community  interest, was  made  to dampen  the\n\ndefense's  flirtation with  jury  nullification (described  infra\n                                                                 \n\nPart VIII).   Courts should  allow prosecutors greater  leeway in\n\nrebuttal  when the defense has  itself breached the standards for\n\nproper summation.   See  Young, 470  U.S. at  11; Lawn  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 355 U.S. 339, 359  n.15 (1958); Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n274;  United States  v. Flaherty,  668  F.2d 566,  598 (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1981).  Applying this offshoot of the goose-and-gander principle,\n\nwe  hold that  the challenged  comment did  not constitute  plain\n\nerror.\n\nVIII.  JURY NULLIFICATION\n\n          The   defendants   invoked   the   specter   of    jury\n\nnullification  during  final  arguments.    Labrie's  lawyer,  in\n\nparticular, invited the jury to \"send out  a question\" concerning\n\nthis doctrine.  Three non-events followed; the government did not\n\nobject to this  soliloquy, the district  court did not  intervene\n\nsua sponte,  and the court's  charge did not broach  the subject.\n          \n\nNevertheless, the deliberating jury took the invitation literally\n\n                                50\n\nand asked the judge to \"[c]larify the law on jury nullification.\"\n\nThe court responded by telling the jury:\n\n          Federal   trial  judges   are  forbidden   to\n          instruct on jury  nullification, because they\n          are  required  to instruct  only  on  the law\n          which applies to a case.  As I have indicated\n          to  you, the burden in each instance which is\n          here placed  upon the Government is  to prove\n          each element of the  offenses . . .  beyond a\n          reasonable  doubt,  and  in  the  event   the\n          Government  fails to  sustain  its burden  of\n          proof  beyond  a reasonable  doubt as  to any\n          essential  element  of  any  offense  charged\n          against each defendant, it has then failed in\n          its  burden of proof as to such defendant and\n          that defendant is to be acquitted.  In short,\n          if the Government proves its case against any\n          defendant, you should convict that defendant.\n          If it  fails to  prove its  case against  any\n          defendant you must acquit that defendant.\n\nAppellants objected to  this supplemental instruction.   They now\n\nargue that the instruction amounted to a wrongful repudiation  of\n\nthe time-honored concept of jury nullification.\n\n          The  applicable rule is  that, although  jurors possess\n\nthe  raw power to set  an accused free  for any reason  or for no\n\nreason, their duty is  to apply the law as  given to them by  the\n\ncourt.  See   United States v.  Boardman, 419 F.2d 110,  116 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1969),  cert. denied,  397 U.S.  991 (1970).   Accordingly,\n                          \n\nwhile jurors may choose to  flex their muscles, ignoring both law\n\nand evidence in  a gadarene rush to acquit  a criminal defendant,\n\nneither the court nor counsel should encourage jurors to exercise\n\nthis power.   See United  States v. Trujillo,  714 F.2d 102,  106\n                                            \n\n(11th Cir.  1983).  A  trial judge, therefore, may  block defense\n\nattorneys' attempts  to serenade  a jury with  the siren  song of\n\nnullification,  see United States  v. Garcia-Rosa, 876  F.2d 209,\n                                                 \n\n                                51\n\n226 (1st  Cir. 1989); and, indeed,  may instruct the  jury on the\n\ndimensions of their duty to the exclusion of  jury nullification,\n\nsee Trujillo, 714 F.2d at 105-06 (collecting cases).\n            \n\n          To the extent that appellants, during closing argument,\n\nmanaged to  mention nullification,  they received  more than  was\n\ntheir  due.    Having  pocketed  this  gratuity,  appellants  now\n\ncomplain that they were  not allowed to capitalize  on it.   When\n\nthe jurors rose to the  bait, appellants say, Judge Devine should\n\nhave   assured  them   that  nullification   is  an   \"historical\n\nprerogative\"  of juries  from  time  immemorial.    We  disagree.\n\nThough jury nullification has a long and sometimes  storied past,\n\nsee Boardman, 419  F.2d at 116, the  case law makes plain  that a\n            \n\njudge may not  instruct the jury anent its  history, vitality, or\n\nuse.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d  347, 350\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir.  1991)  (collecting  cases).    This  proscription  is\n\ninvariant; it makes no difference that the jury inquired, or that\n\nan  aggressive  lawyer  managed  to  pique  a  particular  jury's\n\ncuriosity by mentioning the subject in closing argument, or  that\n\na napping prosecutor  failed to raise a timely  objection to that\n\nallusion.    Thus,  the  district  court  appropriately  scotched\n\nappellants' suggested jury instruction.\n\n          Appellants'  fallback  position     that  the  district\n\ncourt, if  disinclined to sing the praises of jury nullification,\n\nshould have  refrained from  giving any  supplemental instruction\n\nand,  instead, should have  stonewalled   is  not well conceived.\n\nThe objection  focuses on  the district  court's opening  comment\n\n                                52\n\nthat \"[f]ederal  trial judges are  forbidden to instruct  on jury\n\nnullification,\"  interpreting  this  as  a  judicial  prohibition\n\nagainst  the jury's  use of  its inherent  power.   The objection\n\nfails for  several reasons,  most noticeably  because the  quoted\n\nstatement conveys no such chilling effect.\n\n          Taken  literally, the  judge's  comment is  an accurate\n\nrecitation of the law and  an appropriate rejoinder to the jury's\n\nquestion on  nullification (a question that appellants prompted).\n\nThe district court  explained why it could not  answer the jury's\n\nrequest for more information on nullification.  The court went on\n\nto  repeat its earlier instruction that  if the government proved\n\nits  case  the jury  \"should\"  convict, while  if  the government\n\nfailed to carry its burden the jury \"must\" acquit.  This contrast\n\nin directives, together with  the court's refusal to instruct  in\n\nany  detail  about  the  doctrine  of  jury  nullification,  left\n\npregnant the possibility that the jury could ignore the law if it\n\nso chose.  Whether the jury perceived this possibility or not, no\n\nerror infiltrated the court's supplemental instruction.\n\nIX.  VARIANCE BETWEEN INDICTMENT AND PROOF\n\n          Appellants Edgar Sepulveda and Tony Rood now claim that\n\nthe  district court should have  acquitted them because they were\n\nnot part  of the charged  conspiracy.  We review  their claims to\n\ndetermine whether  there is  sufficient evidence  to support  the\n\njury's verdict.  See David, 940 F.2d at 732.  We conclude that  a\n                          \n\nrational  jury  could find,  as  this  jury  did, that  a  single\n\nconspiracy  existed, and that  the two objectors  participated in\n\n                                53\n\nit.\n\n          We start with bedrock.  Ordinarily, questions anent the\n\nnumber  and structure  of conspiracies  present  matters of  fact\n\nsuitable for  resolution by  a jury.   See id.; United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d 230, 243 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 489 U.S. 849\n                                                   \n\n(1990).   Of  course, the  jury's  inquiry is  guided by  certain\n\nprinciples.   For  example, in  a  unitary conspiracy  it is  not\n\nnecessary that the membership remain static, see United States v.\n                                                              \n\nPerholtz, 842 F.2d  343, 364 (D.C. Cir.), cert.  denied, 488 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n821 (1988), or that all members join at the same time, see United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Cintolo, 818  F.2d 980, 997  (1st Cir.)  (deeming that\n                  \n\nlatecomers to a  conspiracy adopt the prior acts and declarations\n\nof earlier arrivals), cert. denied,  484 U.S. 913 (1987), or that\n                                  \n\na given member knows  all his fellow coconspirators, see  Rivera-\n                                                                 \n\nSantiago, 872 F.2d at 1079.   Similarly, the modus operandi of  a\n                                                           \n\nconspiracy may vary over time without negating the existence of a\n\nsingle conspiracy.  See Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 223.\n                                   \n\n          Turning to the instant case,  several defendants argued\n\nthat  they were  not  members  of the  charged  conspiracy.   The\n\ndistrict  court instructed  the  jury that  it  should convict  a\n\nparticular defendant only  if it found him  or her to be  part of\n\nthe  single  conspiracy  limned  in the  indictment.    The court\n\ncautioned the  jurors that  they must  acquit  any defendant  not\n\nlinked  to  that  conspiracy even  if  they  concluded that  such\n\ndefendant  had  been a  member  of  a  separate, equally  heinous\n\nconspiracy.  The  verdict, then, had the effect  of rejecting the\n\n                                54\n\n\"multiple  conspiracy\"  defense,  instead signifying  the  jury's\n\ncontrary conclusion that the appellants collogued together within\n\nthe framework of the master conspiracy.\n\n          To  be sure,  the  charged  conspiracy  had  a  protean\n\nquality    but  many criminal  conspiracies,  particularly  large\n\nconspiracies that  function for  extended periods  of time,  must\n\nadjust  to  cope with  changing  conditions.    In this  respect,\n\nconspiracies are like other business organizations:  a conspiracy\n\nmay  hire,  fire,  retool, change  suppliers,  expand,  downsize,\n\nrefine   its  operating   practices,   undertake  new   marketing\n\nstrategies, or  shift its priorities  from time  to time  without\n\nsacrificing its essential  identity.  It is, therefore, not fatal\n\nto  the  government's  \"single  conspiracy\"  theory  that   David\n\nSepulveda began his career  by patronizing a cocaine supplier  in\n\nNashua, and  later switched to  a source in Lawrence.   Likewise,\n\nthe fact that the organization's methods and tactics evolved over\n\ntime did not dictate  a finding of  two, three, or four  separate\n\nconspiracies.    The government  offered  evidence  showing that,\n\nthroughout the  six-year period  covered by  the indictment,  the\n\ngoals  of the organization were constant,  its leadership did not\n\nchange, and  much of its  membership remained stable.   These are\n\nimportant indicia  of unitariness.   See David, 940 F.2d  at 734.\n                                              \n\nAll in all,  we find the common threads adequate to create a jury\n\nquestion as to whether a single conspiracy existed.\n\n          The  evidence  tying  Edgar  Sepulveda  to  the  single\n\nconspiracy  is more  than ample.   Two  witnesses testified  that\n\n                                55\n\nEdgar, himself, sold them cocaine.  Four witnesses testified that\n\nEdgar routinely  accompanied his  brother, David,  on drug-buying\n\nsprees.   One of  these witnesses,  Norberto Perez, testified  to\n\ntaking  an average  of one  such trip  a week with  the Sepulveda\n\nsiblings over a protracted period of time.  Another witness, John\n\nRice, testified that he  saw the Sepulvedas packaging  cocaine at\n\nDriesse's home.\n\n          There is  similar, albeit  less pervasive, evidence  of\n\nRood's role  in the  organization.  Perez  testified that  he and\n\nRood made  over fifteen trips  to Lawrence in order  to replenish\n\nDavid  Sepulveda's drug  inventory.   When  David  agreed to  pay\n\nSantos in  kind for chauffeuring  him during a drug  delivery, he\n\ninstructed  Rood,  in  Santos's  presence,  to  give  Santos  his\n\nstipend.   On  another occasion,  David  sent Rood  and Perez  to\n\nretrieve cocaine that had  been abandoned during a  police chase.\n\nFinally,  a gaggle of witnesses, including Santos, testified that\n\nthey had purchased cocaine from Rood.  From this variegated proof\n\nthe jury could permissibly weave a tapestry linking Rood with the\n\nmaster conspiracy rather  than isolating him within  the cloister\n\nof the self-styled \"mini-conspiracy\" in which he now professes to\n\nhave been involved.  See Moran, 984 F.2d at 1304; Glenn, 828 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 861-62.\n\n          To recapitulate,  the record satisfactorily  supports a\n\nmultifaceted  finding that the  single conspiracy charged  in the\n\nindictment  existed and that  both Edgar Sepulveda  and Tony Rood\n\nenlisted  in it.   Thus,  no  material variance  existed and  the\n\n                                56\n\ndistrict court properly refused to order acquittal.\n\nX.  POTPOURRI\n\n          Appellants raise a  number of other issues.   Believing\n\nthat  exegetic treatment of  these points  would serve  no useful\n\npurpose, we  reject some  by means of  this global  reference and\n\ndiscuss the rest in summary fashion.\n\n               A.  Particularity of the Indictment.\n                                                  \n\n          Two  appellants  challenge  the  particularity  of  the\n\nindictment as it applies to them.  While we comment separately on\n\neach  challenge, we  first lay  out  the black-letter  rule:   in\n\ngeneral,  an  indictment   is  sufficiently   particular  if   it\n\nelucidates  the elements of the  crime, enlightens a defendant as\n\nto the  nature of the charge  against which she must  defend, and\n\nenables  her   to  plead  double   jeopardy  in  bar   of  future\n\nprosecutions for the same offense.  See Hamling v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n418  U.S. 87,  117 (1974)  (collecting cases);  see also  Fed. R.\n                                                        \n\nCrim. P. 7(c)(1).\n\n          1.  Arline Welch.  Defendant Arline Welch argues  that,\n          1.  Arline Welch.\n                          \n\nas it  applies to  her, the  indictment transgresses  the Hamling\n                                                                 \n\nguidelines.  The gravamen of her complaint is that the indictment\n\nneither contains the elements of  the crime charged nor limns the\n\ndate, time,  and place of  her ostensible criminal activity.   We\n\nthink  her reading  of the  charging papers  is colored  by self-\n\ninterest.\n\n          The grand jury indicted Welch for conspiracy to possess\n\nand distribute  cocaine in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     846.   To\n\n                                57\n\nconvict  her, therefore,  the  government had  to  show beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt that a drug-trafficking conspiracy existed about\n\nwhich Welch knew and in  which she voluntarily participated.  See\n                                                                 \n\nDavid, 940 F.2d at 735 (explaining elements of conspiracy under  \n     \n\n846);  Gomez-Pabon, 911  F.2d at  852 (similar).   The indictment\n                  \n\nspecifies the  law which  Welch is alleged  to have  violated and\n\nelaborates that she, with others, \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\"\n\nagreed to act in contravention of that law.   The indictment also\n\nprovides a temporal framework, asserts that Welch's residence was\n\nused as  a packaging center  for the drug distribution  ring, and\n\nstates that she worked as a \"runner\" and a \"street-level dealer.\"\n\nWe think  this information  sufficiently spelled  out the  crime,\n\napprised Welch of the charge against which she had to defend, and\n\nprotected her from the boggart  of double jeopardy.  See Hamling,\n                                                                \n\n418 U.S. at 117;  Paiva, 892 F.2d at 154.  In  the last analysis,\n                       \n\nindictments need not be infinitely specific.\n\n          2.   Kevin Cullinane.   Defendant Kevin  Cullinane also\n          2.   Kevin Cullinane.\n                              \n\nchallenges the indictment's  particularity.  Notwithstanding  the\n\npervasive proof of his complicitous conduct adduced at trial, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Part II(B), Cullinane points out that the indictment itself\n     \n\nonly mentions him twice, asserting that he purchased cocaine from\n\nDavid   Sepulveda  and  that,   on  one  specific   occasion,  he\n\ndistributed  cocaine to another coconspirator.  But the frequency\n\nwith which a person is (or is  not) mentioned in an indictment is\n\nan  insufficient  indicium  of  the  indictment's  particularity.\n\nHere,  the  charging  papers  contained  considerable  contextual\n\n                                58\n\ndetail.   Given  the  indictment's  general  description  of  the\n\nconspiracy and  identification of the alleged  coconspirators, we\n\nfind  that  it   put  Cullinane  on  fair  notice  and  contained\n\ninformation sufficient to allow him  to prepare his defense.  See\n                                                                 \n\nHamling, 418 U.S. at 117.  The drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C.\n       \n\n  846,  does not  require the government  to plead  or prove  any\n\nparticular overt  acts in  furtherance of  a charged  conspiracy.\n\nSee United  States v. O'Campo,  973 F.2d 1015, 1019-20  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1992); Paiva, 892 F.2d at 155.\n            \n\n                     B.

When pursued, they  need be granted only if the\n\naccused, in the absence of a more detailed specification, will be\n\ndisabled from preparing  a defense, caught by unfair  surprise at\n\ntrial, or hampered in seeking  the shelter of the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause.  See  United States  v. Abreu, 952  F.2d 1458, 1469  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.) (collecting cases),  cert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 1695 (1992).\n                                       \n\nWe  review refusals  to  require such  bills  under an  abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion test.   See United States v. Hallock, 941  F.2d 36, 40\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Here, both appellants enjoyed  the benefits of modified\n\nopen-file discovery, i.e.,  automatic discovery that  encompassed\n                         \n\nall relevant data except Jencks Act material related to witnesses\n\nnot  employed in law enforcement.  Neither appellant convincingly\n\n                                59\n\nrelates  a concrete instance  of inability to  prepare, untenable\n\nsurprise, or other  cognizable prejudice stemming from  the trial\n\ncourt's refusal to mandate further particulars.  For our part, we\n\nhave  been  unable  to  discover  any  such  instance.    In  the\n\nunremarkable circumstances of this case, the district court acted\n\nwell  within  the   encincture  of  its  discretion   in  denying\n\nappellants' motions.\n\n                        C.  Speedy Trial.\n                                        \n\n          Arline Welch  contends that  the court  below erred  in\n\nrefusing to  dismiss the charges  against her on the  ground that\n\ntoo long  a time  intervened between indictment  and trial.   Her\n\nclaim invokes  the  Speedy  Trial Act,  18  U.S.C.      3161-3174\n\n(1988).  The Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n               In  any  case  in which  a  plea  of not\n          guilty is entered,  the trial of a  defendant\n          charged in  an . .  . indictment . .  . shall\n          commence within seventy days from the  filing\n          date . . .  of the . . . indictment,  or from\n          the date the defendant has appeared before  a\n          judicial officer  . . ., whichever  date last\n          occurs.\n\n18 U.S.C.   3161(c)(1).\n\n          For   Speedy  Trial   Act  purposes,   time  has   both\n\nquantitative  and qualitative dimensions.  The Act's 70-day trial\n\nmandate,  see id.,  exemplifies its  quantitative side.   On  the\n                 \n\nqualitative  side,  the  Act  excludes  from  the  70-day  period\n\nintervals of delay  that result from such events  as the pendency\n\nof pretrial motions, see 18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F),  the presence\n                        \n\nof other defendants  in the case \"as  to whom the time  for trial\n\nhas not run and no motion for severance has been granted,\" id. at\n                                                              \n\n                                60\n\n  3161(h)(7), or continuances which  serve the \"ends of justice,\"\n\nid. at   3161(h)(8)(A).  Therefore, a violation of the Act occurs\n   \n\nonly if (i) a sufficient  number of days elapse (the quantitative\n\nbenchmark),  and (ii) the days are nonexcludable (the qualitative\n\nbenchmark).\n\n          Against this background, the chronology of Welch's case\n\nis telling.  Her arraignment took place on November 19, 1990, and\n\nher trial started on April 2, 1991.  Quantitatively, this 134-day\n\ninterval  exceeds the  goal set  by the Speedy  Trial Act.   But,\n\nqualitatively,  the  record  presents   a  much  more  excusatory\n\npicture.   The bulk of  the time elapsed between  arraignment and\n\ntrial  is  excludable  for  Speedy  Trial  Act  purposes  because\n\npretrial motions filed by the defendants, as  a group, engendered\n\nconsiderable delay (bringing the nonexcludable time to fewer than\n\n35 days).   Hence, the court  below did not  err in declining  to\n\ndismiss  the case  under  the  Speedy Trial  Act.25   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States  v.

David Chase's Testimony.\n                                              \n\n          At  trial,  David  Chase testified  that  he  regularly\n\n                    \n\n     25We  note that the district court  also granted an ends-of-\njustice  continuance on December  18, 1990, in  response to David\nSepulveda's  motion for  an  extension  of  discovery  deadlines,\nthereby providing an  additional source of excludable  time.  See\n                                                                 \n18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(8)(A).\n\n                                61\n\npurchased cocaine  from appellant  Cullinane until, having  grown\n\ndissatisfied  with the  quality of  Cullinane's  wares, he  began\n\nbuying  directly from David  Sepulveda.  Cullinane  argues before\n\nus, as he  argued below, that Chase's testimony  should have been\n\npurged   because  Chase  did  not  explicitly  tie  Cullinane  to\n\nSepulveda.  We disagree.\n\n            The  relevancy  of a  witness's  testimony cannot  be\n\ngauged in isolation.  See United States v. Hickey, 596 F.2d 1082,\n                                                 \n\n1089  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  444 U.S.  853 (1979).   Several\n                               \n\nwitnesses other  than Chase  described Cullinane's  dealings with\n\nSepulveda,  including his purchases of contraband and their joint\n\nparticipation  in drug-buying excursions.   Given this contextual\n\ndetail, the  jury could well infer  that the sales to  Chase were\n\nconnected to the Cullinane-Sepulveda  axis.  In a criminal  case,\n\nproof  need  not  be  explicit;  juries  are  permitted,  indeed,\n\nencouraged, to draw  reasonable inferences from the  facts before\n\nthem.  See, e.g.,  Echeverri, 982 F.2d  at 679; United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nIngraham, 832 F.2d 229, 239-40 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  1009  (1988).    The  district  court  did  not  abuse  its\n\ndiscretion in admitting evidence of Cullinane's sales to Chase as\n\ncircumstantial evidence of  Cullinane's role in  the distribution\n\nnetwork.\n\n                 E.  Steven Ranfros's Testimony.\n                                               \n\n          David  Sepulveda objected  to the  testimony of  Steven\n\nRanfros,  a police  officer  who  recounted  that  Sepulveda  and\n\nseveral of his associates chased Ranfros when they discovered him\n\n                                62\n\nwatching  them  from  a  wooded area.    Sepulveda  insists  that\n\nRanfros's testimony lacks any relevance.\n\n          Relevance is defined  in terms of probative  value, see\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R. Evid. 401, and  trial courts are afforded wide discretion\n\nin  assessing  the  relevance and  probative  value  of proffered\n\nevidence.  See United States v. Sutton, 970 F.2d 1001, 1006  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1992); United  States v.  Nickens, 955  F.2d 112,  125 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct.  108 (1992).  We will disturb  an\n                   \n\nexercise  of  that discretion  only  upon a  showing  of manifest\n\nabuse.  See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 898  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1993).   We discern  no such problem  here.   Ranfros's testimony\n\ncould  be taken  to  bear  on guilty  knowledge,  and, thus,  the\n\ndistrict court had discretion to allow the jury to consider it.\n\n                       F.  The Terry Stop.\n                                         \n\n          At trial, the government  introduced evidence that  the\n\npolice  seized $4,200 from  David Sepulveda after  a highway stop\n\nnear  Nashua.   Sepulveda moved  to suppress  the evidence.   The\n\ngovernment contended that  the cash constituted  the fruits of  a\n\nsearch incident  to a lawful  arrest.  The district  court denied\n\nthe  suppression motion without comment.  Sepulveda assigns error\n\nto this  ruling and to  the admission of evidence  emanating from\n\nthe seizure.\n\n          In  its appellate  brief, the  government concedes  the\n\nfallibility of the construct that it hawked in the district court\n\nand, instead, attempts to justify the search under Terry v. Ohio,\n                                                                \n\n392  U.S. 1,  29-30  (1968).   At  oral  argument the  government\n\n                                63\n\nexecuted yet  another about-face,  acknowledging that the  Terry-\n                                                                \n\nbased yarn  spun in its  brief is easily  unravelled.  We  do not\n\nfind  it surprising  that  the  prosecution,  like  a  Pirandello\n\ncharacter in  search of  an author,  has encountered  insuperable\n\ndifficulties in articulating a viable theory:  the short of it is\n\nthat the cash  was unlawfully  seized and  that evidence  derived\n\nfrom  the  seizure  should  have  been suppressed.    We  do  not\n\nunderstand why  the government is  unwilling simply to  face that\n\nfact    or why it pressed so vigorously to have evidence obtained\n\nin a patently illegal manner admitted in the first place.\n\n          At  any rate,  the matter  is academic.   As  a general\n\nrule,  a defendant  is not  shielded if  the  government violates\n\nsomeone  else's  constitutional  rights.   See  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nSantana, 6 F.3d 1, 8  (1st Cir. 1993).  Consequently, Sepulveda's\n       \n\ncoconspirators have no standing to raise  a claimed abridgment of\n\nhis Fourth Amendment  rights.  See United States  v. Padilla, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 1936, 1939 (1993); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98,  106\n                                              \n\n(1980).\n\n          As  to  Sepulveda  himself,  the  erroneously  admitted\n\nevidence is cumulative.   In testimony not covered  by the motion\n\nto suppress, a civilian witness, Michael Lacerte, related that he\n\nhad given  the funds in  question to Sepulveda so  that Sepulveda\n\ncould   buy  cocaine.     Lacerte   also  recounted   Sepulveda's\n\nexplanation as to seizure of the money.  Under the circumstances,\n\nand bearing in mind the factors that frame our inquiry, see supra\n                                                                 \n\npp. 30,  whatever error inhered  in admitting evidence  anent the\n\n                                64\n\nseizure and its sequelae was entirely harmless.\n\n                         G.  Jury Taint.\n                                       \n\n          At one point during the  trial, a juror joked about one\n\nof the defendants.  The  district court proceeded to question two\n\njurors  out of  earshot of  the  venire.   After identifying  the\n\nindividual  responsible for  the  wisecrack, the  court dismissed\n\nher.   Appellants  moved unsuccessfully  for  a mistrial  and now\n\nposit error based on the denial of their motion.\n\n          We  find  nothing  amiss.   When  a  potentially taint-\n\nproducing  event threatens  to  mar  the  jury's  integrity,  the\n\ndistrict  court has fairly  broad discretion in  deciding whether\n\nthe  situation is  susceptible to  remediation, and  if  so, what\n\ncorrective action might be appropriate.   See Boylan, 898 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n258; Gutierrez-Rodriguez  v. Cartagena,  882 F.2d  553, 570  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1989).   Unless the event leaves  so sour a taste  that less\n\nextreme palliatives will prove inadequate to undo serious damage,\n\nthe  mere  possibility  of  jury taint  does  not  necessitate  a\n\nmistrial.  See  United States v. Hunnewell, 891  F.2d 955, 960-61\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1989).  Mindful of the trial  court's superior coign of\n\nvantage, we  accord great respect  to a district  judge's finding\n\nthat a  jury has not been  irreparably tainted.  See  Boylan, 898\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 258.\n\n          Here,   the    judge   employed   a    combination   of\n\namelioratives:  he removed the  offending juror from the case and\n\nissued hortatory  instructions to  the remaining  jurors.   Given\n\nwhat  transpired, the judge's  prescription seems reasonably well\n\n                                65\n\ncalculated  to  protect  the defendants'  legitimate  rights; the\n\njoke,  albeit tasteless,  did not  work a  per se  deprivation of\n                                                 \n\nappellants' right to a fair trial.  Consequently, the court acted\n\nappropriately in refusing to abort the trial.  See Hunnewell, 891\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 961.\n\n                   H.  Destruction of Evidence.\n                                              \n\n          On   May  5,  1989,   in  the  course   of  a  separate\n\ninvestigation, the government took  custody of certain  telephone\n\nrecords  belonging to defendant  Cullinane.  After  examining the\n\nrecords, the  government returned them to  Cullinane's housemate.\n\nIn  turn,  the  housemate  threw  them  out.    Seizing  on  this\n\ndevelopment,  appellant  Arline  Welch   asseverates  that  those\n\nrecords  may have  contained  exculpatory material  vis-a-vis her\n\nrelationship with Cullinane and that, therefore, the government's\n\nfailure  to maintain them  requires dismissal of  the indictment.\n\nThe asseveration is full of holes.\n\n          Government  destruction   of  potentially   exculpatory\n\nevidence only violates the rule in Brady,  373 U.S. at 87, if the\n                                        \n\nevidence  possesses apparent exculpatory  value that cannot fully\n\nbe  replicated through other sources, and  if the government acts\n\nwillfully or in bad faith in failing to preserve it.  See Arizona\n                                                                 \n\nv. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51,  58 (1988); California v.  Trombetta,\n                                                                \n\n467 U.S.  479, 488-89  (1984); United States  v. Femia,      F.3d\n                                                      \n\n   ,       (1st  Cir.  1993)  [No. 93-1276,  slip  op.  at  8-9].\n\nGovernment investigators typically cast a  wide net and haul in a\n\nvariety  of  items.    While evidence,  once  seized,  cannot  be\n\n                                66\n\ndestroyed  willy-nilly, the government does not become an insurer\n\nof  the  perpetual  availability  of  every  item  caught in  its\n\ninvestigatory net.  See, e.g., United States v. Kincaid, 712 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n          In  the situation  at  hand,  the  government  did  not\n\ndestroy  the  records Welch  seeks  but merely  returned  them to\n\nCullinane's residence.   There  is no  hint of  bad faith and  no\n\nindication that the agents knew, or should have anticipated, that\n\nCullinane's friend  would thereafter discard them.   Accordingly,\n\nWelch's motion is best regarded as a throwaway.26\n\n                      I.  Cumulative Error.\n                                          \n\n          Appellants argue  that  even if  certain trial  errors,\n\ntaken in isolation,  appear harmless, the accumulation  of errors\n\neffectively undermines due process and demands a fresh start.  We\n\naccept   the   theoretical   underpinnings   of  this   argument.\n\nIndividual errors,  insufficient in  themselves to  necessitate a\n\nnew trial, may in the  aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States  v. Dwyer,  843 F.2d  60, 65 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1988); Dunn v. Perrin, 570 F.2d 21, 25  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n437  U.S. 910 (1978); cf. United States v. Samango, 607 F.2d 877,\n                                                  \n\n884  (9th  Cir.  1979) (employing  cumulative  error  doctrine to\n\ninvalidate results of grand jury  proceeding).  In other words, a\n\ncolumn  of  errors  may  sometimes  have  a  logarithmic  effect,\n\nproducing a total  impact greater than the arithmetic  sum of its\n\n                    \n\n     26In view of  this shortfall, we need not  address the other\nprongs of the test.\n\n                                67\n\nconstituent parts.\n\n          Of  necessity,   claims  under  the   cumulative  error\n\ndoctrine are  sui generis.   A  reviewing tribunal must  consider\n                         \n\neach such claim  against the background of  the case as  a whole,\n\npaying particular weight to factors such as the nature and number\n\nof the  errors committed;  their interrelationship,  if any,  and\n\ncombined effect; how the district  court dealt with the errors as\n\nthey arose (including the efficacy   or lack of efficacy   of any\n\nremedial efforts);  and the  strength of  the government's  case.\n\nSee,  e.g., Mejia-Lozano, 829  F.2d at 274  n.4.  The  run of the\n                        \n\ntrial  may   also  be  important;   a  handful  of   miscues,  in\n\ncombination, may often pack a greater punch in a short trial than\n\nin a much longer trial.\n\n          The  cumulative  error  doctrine  is  inapposite  here.\n\nWhile we have  uncovered a few benign bevues,  e.g., the district\n                                                   \n\ncourt's failure  to grant  David Sepulveda's  motion to  suppress\n\nevidence of money illegally seized from him, see supra Part X(F),\n                                                      \n\nand  the ill-advised admission  of two statements  unsupported by\n\nextrinsic  evidence and, hence,  ineligible for special swaddling\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), see supra Part V(B), the errors\n                                           \n\nwere  not  portentous;  they  were  few  and  far  between;  they\n\npossessed  no  special  symbiotic effect;  they  occurred  in the\n\ncourse of a  two-month trial; and the government's  case was very\n\nstrong.  Consequently, the errors,  in the aggregate, do not come\n\nclose to achieving  the critical mass necessary to  cast a shadow\n\nupon the integrity of the verdict.\n\n                                68\n\n          Considering the  trial's length, complexity,  and hard-\n\nfought nature,  the district court's  handling of  it evokes  our\n\nadmiration.    Appellants'  focus on  cumulative  error  does not\n\nchange  the  picture.    The  Constitution  entitles  a  criminal\n\ndefendant to a  fair trial,  not to  a mistake-free  trial.   See\n                                                                 \n\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475  U.S. 673, 681 (1986); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Polito,  856 F.2d 414, 418 (1st Cir. 1988).   When all is said\n         \n\nand done, the proceedings here meet this measure.\n\nXI.  SENTENCING ISSUES\n\n          The sentencing issues raised in these appeals implicate\n\nthe  federal sentencing  guidelines.27   See  David, 940  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n739  (holding  that the  guidelines  apply to  a  conspiracy that\n\n\"begins before the guidelines' effective date and continues after\n\nthe  effective date\").  Six appellants (Rood, Wallace, Cullinane,\n\nArline  Welch,  Edward  Welch,  and  Johnson)  challenge  rulings\n\nrelative to  the imposition  of sentence.28   To the  extent that\n\nthese challenges touch  upon the district court's  factfinding or\n\nits evaluative judgments in applying the guidelines to the  facts\n\nas found, appellate review is for clear error.  See United States\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     27Since the  district court sentenced appellants  on various\ndates  in  January   1992,  the  November  1991  version  of  the\nsentencing guidelines applies in this case.  See United States v.\n                                                              \nHarotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.  1990) (\"Barring any\n          \nex post facto problem, a defendant is to be punished according to\n             \nthe   guidelines  in  effect   at  the  time   of  sentencing.\").\nTherefore, all references to the sentencing guidelines will be to\nthe  November   1991  edition,   unless  otherwise   specifically\nindicated.\n\n     28The court  below sentenced  appellants to assorted  prison\nterms  ranging from  a  high of  almost  twenty-two years  (David\nSepulveda) to a low of five years.\n\n                                69\n\nv. St.  Cyr, 977 F.2d 698,  701 (1st Cir.  1992).  To  the extent\n           \n\nthat  the challenges  raise  \"pure\" questions  of law  or require\n\ninterpretation of the guidelines, our review is plenary.  See id.\n                                                                 \n\n                     A.  General Principles.\n                                           \n\n          In   drug-trafficking   cases  under   the   sentencing\n\nguidelines, sentences  are largely quantity-driven.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v. Morillo,      F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993) [No.\n                        \n\n93-1388,  slip op. at  12 &amp; n.10];  United States  v. Garcia, 954\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  12, 15 (1st Cir.  1992); United States  v. Blanco, 888 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n907, 909-11 (1st  Cir. 1989); see also United  States v. Bradley,\n                                                                \n\n917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir. 1990) (describing drug quantity as \"a\n\nkey  datum\"  for   sentencing  purposes).    The   drug  quantity\n\nattributable  to  a  particular defendant  is  derived  by adding\n\ntogether the amounts of narcotics, actual or negotiated, bound up\n\nin the acts  \"that were  part of  the same course  of conduct  or\n\ncommon scheme  or plan as  the offense of conviction.\"   U.S.S.G.\n\n 1B1.3(a)(2).   However,  in the  context  of jointly  undertaken\n\ncriminal  activity,  such as  a  conspiracy, a  defendant  is not\n\nautomatically  saddled with the  full weight of  the conspiracy's\n\nwrongdoing;  rather,  a  defendant is  responsible  for  drugs he\n\npersonally  handled  or  anticipated  handling,  and,  under  the\n\nrelevant  conduct rubric, for  drugs involved in  additional acts\n\nthat  were reasonably  foreseeable by  him and were  committed in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy.   See  Garcia, 954  F.2d at  15;\n                                              \n\nDavid,  940 F.2d at 742; see also U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(1), comment.\n                                 \n\n(n.1).  In this regard, we have emphasized that \"the measure of a\n\n                                70\n\ndefendant's  accountability for drug transactions in which he was\n\nnot personally  involved is usually  congruent with the  scope of\n\nhis  agreement  with  the  other  participants  in  the  criminal\n\nenterprise.\"  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 16.\n                    \n\n                 B.  Tony Rood; William Wallace.\n                                               \n\n          Appellants  Rood and  Wallace  object to  the  district\n\ncourt's  attribution  of  particular  drug  quantities  to  them.\n\nBecause the same type of error infects both sentences, we discuss\n\nthem in the ensemble.\n\n          In regard  to Rood  and Wallace,  the district  court's\n\ndrug quantity calculations  rested essentially  on Perez's  trial\n\ntestimony.29    According  to  Perez,  Rood  accompanied  him  on\n\nfifteen  to twenty drug-buying jaunts and Wallace accompanied him\n\non ten to  fifteen such trips.   Perez did not  assign particular\n\namounts to particular  people on  particular trips.   Rather,  he\n\ntestified  in sweeping  generalities, stating  that the  smallest\n\namount he  remembered having been  acquired, in the eighty  or so\n\ntrips he took with Sepulveda and an assortment of companions over\n\na two-year period (1987-1989), was four ounces (113.4 grams), and\n\nthe largest amount acquired was one kilogram (an amount purchased\n\nmore  than once).   In  preparing  the presentence  investigation\n\nreport  (PSI Report), the probation department adopted methods of\n\ncalculation  apparently  urged  by the  prosecution.    The basic\n\n                    \n\n     29To  be sure, there  was some evidence  of participation by\nRood and-or Wallace in a few other incidents.  But the quantities\ninvolved in  these incidents were  niggling in comparison  to the\nSepulveda trips and, thus, do not affect these appeals.\n\n                                71\n\nmethod  was to  construct a  double \"average\"  covering both  the\n\nnumber of runs  and the amount of cocaine carried.  This was done\n\nby  taking  the  midpoint  of   the  high  and  low  figures  and\n\nmultiplying the  average  number of  runs by  the average  amount\n\ncarried.  Thus, in Wallace's  case, the PSI Report assumed twelve\n\nruns (an alleged \"average\" of ten and fifteen) and 556 grams  per\n\nrun  (the rounded-off average, expressed in grams, of four ounces\n\nand  one kilogram),  attributing  a total  of  6.68 kilograms  of\n\ncocaine to  him.  In  Rood's case, a different  probation officer\n\nproposed  a  slightly   more  complicated  (but  methodologically\n\nsimilar) calculation  and attributed 8.3  kilograms to him.   The\n\nexact  mechanics  are beside  the  point; what  matters,  for our\n\npurposes,  is  that,  albeit  somewhat  more  circuitously,   the\n\nultimate attribution  of a  drug quantity figure  to Rood,  as to\n\nWallace,  represented   an  assumed   average  number  of   trips\n\nmultiplied by an assumed average quantity of cocaine per trip.\n\n          The district  court held  separate sentencing  hearings\n\nfor Rood and Wallace.  Neither the prosecution nor the defendants\n\noffered additional evidence.  The court, over objection, endorsed\n\nthe probation  officers' calculations, attributing  8.3 kilograms\n\nof cocaine to Rood and 7.6 kilograms  to Wallace.  This yielded a\n\nbase  offense level  (BOL)  of 32  for  each man.   See  U.S.S.G.\n                                                       \n\n 2D1.1(c) (6) (Drug Quantity  Table) (establishing BOL of 32  for\n\nat least five  but less than fifteen kilograms of  cocaine).  The\n\ncourt  essayed  further  offense-level  adjustments (not  now  in\n\ndispute), factored Rood's criminal history category (IV) into the\n\n                                72\n\nmix,  and set  his guideline  sentencing range  (GSR) at  135-168\n\nmonths.   The court sentenced  Rood at  the bottom of  the range.\n\nWallace  displayed a  less notorious  criminal history  (category\n\nII).  Nonetheless,  after interim adjustments not  material here,\n\nhis GSR proved  to be  identical.   Relying on  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nFloyd, 945 F.2d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir.  1991), and citing a lack of\n     \n\nadult   guidance  during  Wallace's  youth,  the  court  departed\n\ndownward, sentencing him to ten years.30\n\n          The defense's first line of attack is to assail Perez's\n\ntestimony as utterly unreliable in view of his dubious character,\n\nasserted  contradictions, and  sundry other  defects.   But,  the\n\ntrial judge  heard and saw  Perez testify at trial,  and credited\n\nhis testimony.   Such credibility  calls are grist for  the trial\n\ncourt's mill.   See St. Cyr, 977  F.2d at 706.   Consequently, we\n                           \n\nhave no basis for overturning this judgment.\n\n          Nonetheless, one swallow  does not a summer make.   The\n\ncritical problem  with respect to  these sentences lies  not with\n\nPerez's testimony  but with  the pyramiding  of inferences  based\n\nupon it.  Perez's testimony was elicited at  trial, not at either\n\nsentencing hearing,  and  the  prosecution,  primarily  concerned\n\nduring trial with proving the defendants' participation in a drug\n\ntrafficking conspiracy rather than fixing the precise quantity of\n\ndrugs  for  which  each  defendant  might  be  held  responsible,\n\n                    \n\n     30Floyd has since  been overruled, albeit on  other grounds.\n            \nSee  United States  v. Atkinson,  990 F.2d  501 (9th  Cir. 1993).\n                               \nHowever, the government has not prosecuted a cross-appeal and the\nvalidity of the departure decision is not before us.\n\n                                73\n\nobtained  a  bare  minimum  of   information.    With  no  better\n\ninformation  at  hand,  these  appellants'  sentences  cannot  be\n\nupheld.\n\n          For sentencing purposes, the government must prove drug\n\nquantities by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112-13 (1st Cir. 1990); Bradley, 917 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 605.   Courts  must sedulously  enforce that  quantum-of-proof\n\nrule, for,  under the  guidelines, drug  quantity has  a dramatic\n\nleveraging   effect.     Thus,   relatively   small  quantitative\n\ndifferences may produce markedly different periods of immurement.\n\nThis reality informs  the preponderance standard, requiring  that\n\ndistrict  courts   must   base  their   findings   on   \"reliable\n\ninformation\" and, where uncertainty reigns, must \"err on the side\n\nof caution.\"   Sklar, 920 F.2d  at 113 (quoting United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nWalton, 908  F.2d 1289, 1302  (6th Cir.), cert. denied,  498 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n990 (1990)).\n\n          These  tenets possess  particular force  on the  record\n\nbefore  us, for  we do  not  believe that  the so-called  average\n\nfigures selected  by the  probation officers  and adopted  by the\n\ntrial court have adequate support in the record.  To say that the\n\nminimum amount carried on a single  trip was four ounces and that\n\nthe maximum  was  one kilogram  provides  no rational  basis  for\n\npresuming that  the average amount  carried on a given  number of\n\ntrips  was  the mathematical  midpoint between  the high  and low\n\nfigures.   Cf. United States v. Hewitt,  942 F.2d 1270, 1274 (8th\n                                      \n\nCir.   1991)  (condemning  use  of  a  \"far  reaching\"  averaging\n\n                                74\n\nassumptions in estimating  drug quantity).  Similarly,  while the\n\ndistortions are mathematically  less serious, the selection  of a\n\nmidpoint in  estimating  the  number of  trips  is  also  without\n\nevidentiary support.   And the  two flawed findings feed  on each\n\nother; by using not one,  but two, unsupported averages to arrive\n\nat both the number of trips undertaken and the amounts of cocaine\n\nhandled  in the  course of  each trip,  the court  compounded the\n\nerror of its ways.   This is,  after all, not a  case in which  a\n\nwitness testified that, in his or her estimation,\"X\" equalled the\n\naverage  drug quantity  involved  in a  specific  number of  drug\n\ntransactions.   That  kind of  estimate  from a  lay witness  may\n\nitself be  troublesome, but  at least the  witness can  be cross-\n\nexamined  on the figure;  and this  court has  sometimes accepted\n\nsuch  estimates  in  the  past.   See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nInnamorati, 996  F.2d 456, 490  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,      S.\n                                                        \n\nCt.     (1993).  It is also  not a case where a witness has given\n\na  range, as  to amounts  or  as to  trips, but  other persuasive\n\nevidence (e.g., documents or records) exists tending to show that\n              \n\nsome figure within  the range is supported by  a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence.  Here, to the contrary, the court did not cite, and\n\nthe PSI Report did not  identify, any extrinsic evidence or other\n\ncircumstances   making   averaging  peculiarly   appropriate   or\n\nsuggesting a  basis, apart from averaging, on which the probation\n\nofficers'  determinations  might rest.    For our  part,  we have\n\ncombed  the record and  unearthed nothing that  remotely suggests\n\nWallace joined in  transporting shipments averaging 556  grams or\n\n                                75\n\nthat Rood's shipments averaged twelve  to sixteen ounces.  In the\n\nface of timely objection, wholly conclusory findings such  as are\n\nnow before us  cannot be said  to command a preponderance  of the\n\nevidence,  and,  therefore, cannot  support an  imposed sentence.\n\nCf., e.g., United States v. Shonubi, 998  F.2d 84, 89-90 (2d Cir.\n                                   \n\n1993) (vacating,  in the  absence of  other evidentiary  support,\n\ndistrict  court's  drug  quantity  finding  arrived  at  by  rote\n\nmultiplication of number  of trips times quantity  carried on one\n\nsuch trip);  United States v.  Garcia, 994 F.2d 1499,  1509 (10th\n                                     \n\nCir.  1993)  (vacating  defendant's  sentence  and  holding  that\n\naverages, when used to arrive  at drug quantity findings, must be\n\n\"more than a guess\").  And the  gap in proof is not satisfied  by\n\nshowing, as  the government seeks to  do in its brief,  that more\n\ntrips and larger amounts are consistent with the general scale of\n\nthe Sepulveda enterprise.\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not announce a per se\n                                                                 \n\nrule barring  a court from  sentencing at a point  different than\n\nthe low end of a testified range.  There may be other evidence in\n\nthe case,  direct or circumstantial,  making it more  likely than\n\nnot  that the  low point is  simply too  low and that  some other\n\npoint  is  more   probably  representative.    Indeed,   in  some\n\nsituations,  the  estimate  itself,  and  the  contextual  detail\n\nsurrounding  it, may  provide the  needed enlightenment.   In our\n\nview, a  sentencing court remains  free to make judicious  use of\n\nproperly  constructed  averages  and,  ultimately,  to  make  any\n\nfinding that  the record supports.   See United States  v. Miele,\n                                                                \n\n                                76\n\n989 F.2d 659, 664-65 (3d Cir. 1993) (explaining that, where there\n\nis  other  evidence  tending  to  buttress the  high  end  of  an\n\nestimated range, the sentencing court need not restrict itself to\n\nthe range's low end); see  also U.S.S.G.   6A1.3(a) (stating that\n                               \n\nthe  information on  which  a  sentence  is  based  must  possess\n\n\"sufficient  indicia  of  reliability  to  support  its  probable\n\naccuracy\").   Here,  however, the  record  does not  justify  the\n\ndistrict  court's findings  concerning  the  drug  quantities  it\n\nattributed  to Rood  and  Wallace.    Accordingly,  because  drug\n\nquantity dictated these  appellants' offense levels and  at least\n\narguably  influenced  their  sentences,  Rood   and  Wallace  are\n\nentitled to be resentenced.31 \n\n                       C.  Kevin Cullinane.\n                                          \n\n          After all relevant adjustments had been made, the court\n\nbelow established a GSR of 121-151  months referable to appellant\n\nCullinane,32  and  sentenced him  at  the  range's  nadir.   This\n\ndetermination  rested in  substantial part  on  the court's  drug\n\n                    \n\n     31On remand, the district court  is, of course, free to hear\nnew evidence bearing on drug quantity.  For example, it  may well\nbe that better evidence  can be adduced by recalling  Perez or by\ncalling other witnesses.   Alternatively, the government  has the\n\"low point\" estimates as to both  the number of trips and amounts\ntransported to fall back upon   and it has some specific evidence\nas to other transactions.  To start a mini-trial on drug quantity\nis surely a  discouraging supplement to a lengthy  trial; but too\nmuch rides  on the  computations to  rely upon the  kind of  drug\nquantity calculations  that the  government urges  in respect  to\nthese two appellants.\n\n     32We  do not  dissect the  interim  adjustments made  by the\ndistrict court en route to  the GSR as Cullinane concentrates his\nfire on the  drug quantity finding.  We follow this same pattern,\nwhenever applicable, in discussing other appellants' sentences.\n\n                                77\n\nquantity  assessment.    Cullinane  challenges  this  assessment,\n\ninsisting that Judge Devine erred in ascribing 8.99  kilograms of\n\ncocaine to him.\n\n          Our   review   of   Cullinane's   challenge   is   more\n\ncircumscribed  than  might  appear   at  first  blush.    It   is\n\nunnecessary  to   address  an   allegedly  erroneous   sentencing\n\ncomputation if,  and to the  extent that, correcting it  will not\n\nchange  the applicable offense  level or otherwise  influence the\n\ndefendant's  GSR (and,  ultimately, his  sentence).   See  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Connell,  960  F.2d  191, 198  n.11  (1st Cir.  1992);\n                  \n\nBradley, 917 F.2d at 604; see also Williams v. United States, 112\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct.  1112, 1121 (1992) (stating that an error in sentencing is\n\nharmless,  and may  be disregarded,  if  it \"did  not affect  the\n\ndistrict  court's  selection  of the  sentence  imposed\").   This\n\nprinciple is pertinent in Cullinane's  case:  his BOL, and, thus,\n\nhis sentence, will remain unchanged  so long as he is responsible\n\nfor an amount of cocaine between five and fifteen kilograms.  See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug  Quantity Table).  His  appeal fails,\n\nthen,  if there  is record  support for  ascribing at  least five\n\nkilograms of cocaine to him.\n\n          We find  this to  be the case.   Although  the district\n\ncourt  relied  on the  testimony  of  a  number of  witnesses  to\n\nbuttress the  drug quantity it  attributed to Cullinane,  we need\n\nnot go beyond the testimony of David Chase.  Chase stated that he\n\nbought somewhere between five and eight kilograms of cocaine from\n\nCullinane.  The district court  found this testimony credible and\n\n                                78\n\nwe,  therefore, give  it  weight.    At  sentencing,  credibility\n\ndeterminations  are the  province  of the  district  court.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.  Brewster, 1 F.3d  51, 55 (1st  Cir. 1993);  St.\n                                                                 \n\nCyr, 977 F.2d at 706; see also 18  U.S.C.   3742(e) (1988).  That\n                              \n\nends  the matter:   the  lowest  of Chase's  estimates affords  a\n\nsufficient predicate for the disputed sentence.\n\n          Cullinane  attempts  to  confess and  avoid.    Even if\n\nChase's  testimony is reliable,  he ruminates, the  conduct Chase\n\ndescribes is irrelevant to the charged conspiracy.  This maneuver\n\ntakes  appellant  down  a  blind alley.    Within  broad  limits,\n\nreviewing courts must defer to a sentencing judge's determination\n\nof  relevant  conduct.    Such  findings  are  almost  invariably\n\nfactbound, and  we will set them aside only  if they are shown to\n\nbe clearly  erroneous.  See Garcia, 954  F.2d at 16; Bradley, 917\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 605.   In addition, the argument for deference peaks when\n\nthe sentencing  judge has  presided over a  lengthy trial  and is\n\nsteeped in the  facts of the case.   See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nShattuck, 961  F.2d 1012, 1014-15 (1st Cir.  1992); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Ct. 2039 (1991).\n\n          These salutary  precepts are  dispositive  here.   Full\n\ndeference is  due and  Chase's testimony, though  circumstantial,\n\ntouched upon,  and could logically  be found to  involve, matters\n\ncoming  within  the scope  of the  conspiracy.   Accordingly, the\n\nlower court  did  not  commit  clear  error  in  concluding  that\n\nCullinane's transactions  with Chase  comprised relevant  conduct\n\n                                79\n\nfor sentencing purposes.\n\n                        D.  Arline Welch.\n                                        \n\n          The  district court attributed 1924 grams of cocaine to\n\nArline  Welch  and imposed  the  mandatory  minimum incarcerative\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B), viz., five years.  Welch\n                                             \n\ncontests  only the  district  court's drug  quantity  assessment.\n\nBecause  the mandatory minimum  applies so long  as quantities of\n\ncocaine totalling 500  grams or more are involved  in the offense\n\nof conviction,  see id., we  need only inquire whether  that much\n                       \n\ncontraband can fairly be attributed to her.\n\n          We answer this  query affirmatively.   Perez  testified\n\nthat  Arline Welch accompanied him  on three journeys to Lawrence\n\nand that 10  ounces of cocaine were  acquired on each trip.   The\n\ndistrict court credited Perez's testimony, attributing nearly 900\n\ngrams of  cocaine to  Arline Welch on  this account.   We decline\n\nappellant's invitation to second-guess this finding. \n\n                        E.  Edward Welch.\n                                        \n\n          The district court attributed 7.72 kilograms of cocaine\n\nto Edward Welch and, after various interim adjustments, sentenced\n\nhim to  135 months  in prison (the  low end  of the GSR).   Welch\n\nchallenges only the drug quantity assessment.\n\n          The  court's  attribution  of cocaine  to  Edward Welch\n\nrests upon a cornucopia of  testimony.  It would serve  no useful\n\npurpose to survey it all.  Upon  careful review of the record, we\n\ncan see, at a minimum, no clear error in the court's  decision to\n\naccept the testimony  of Coriaty and Milne    testimony that was,\n\n                                80\n\nin  itself, sufficient  to support  the attribution  of over  5.3\n\nkilograms to  this defendant.33   At this  point, Welch's  ground\n\nof appeal collapses,  for his sentence  would be the same  if the\n\ncourt had  found 5.3 kilograms  rather than 7.72 kilograms.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Table).\n\n                       F.  Cheryl Johnson.\n                                         \n\n          The  lower court attributed 1.2 kilograms of cocaine to\n\nCheryl  Johnson  and  imposed  the  mandatory  minimum  five-year\n\nsentence.   See 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  Johnson  disputes the\n               \n\ndrug quantity  finding.  Here,  again, the trigger amount  is 500\n\ngrams of cocaine.  See id.\n                          \n\n          The district court determined, inter alia, that Johnson\n                                                   \n\nsold 1/16th  of an  ounce of cocaine  to Santos  on at  least 100\n\noccasions; and that she sold 3/10s of an ounce to  officer Malone\n\non another occasion.  The  court further found that $7,115 seized\n\nfrom  Johnson's house constituted the proceeds of drug sales and,\n\nfor sentencing purposes, equated this cash stash with 5.08 ounces\n\nof cocaine.   Finally, the court credited  Perez's testimony that\n\nJohnson  participated in  at  least  \"a  couple\"  of  drug-buying\n\nexpeditions.   Erring  on the  side of  caution, the  court could\n\nwarrantably   have  found  Johnson  responsible  for  two  trips,\n\n                    \n\n     33At the  risk of carrying  coal to Newcastle, we  note that\nEdward Welch  was a  fellow traveller on,  and a  co-venturer in,\nseveral  drug-buying  expeditions  described  supra  Part  XI(D).\n                                                   \nThus, the drug  quantities associated with those  jaunts are also\nattributable to him.\n\n                                81\n\ninvolving  four  ounces  per  trip.34    In  the  aggregate,  the\n\ndeterminations  listed above support the attribution of 556 grams\n\nof  cocaine  to Johnson     more  than  the minimum  required  to\n\nunderbrace the sentence she received.\n\n          Johnson  argues against these  serial findings on three\n\ngrounds.  Her first attack   a broadside blast aimed at the total\n\nquantity  of cocaine attributed to her   deserves little comment.\n\nWe simply restate the obvious:   the district court's credibility\n\ncalls  are  beyond  reproach   and,  therefore,  its  bottom-line\n\nconclusion is not clearly erroneous.\n\n          Johnson's  second  fusillade  is  aimed   at  the  cash\n\nequivalency finding.  In drawing a head on the sentencing court's\n\ndecision to  translate dollars  into drugs,  Johnson is  shooting\n\nblanks.   The government presented abundant evidence of Johnson's\n\nnarcotics trafficking, see  supra Part II(D),  and the volume  of\n                                 \n\nbusiness  transacted justified the court's illation that the sums\n\nseized  were  connected  to  her  drug  dealings.    When  it  is\n\nreasonably probable that confiscated cash  represents either drug\n\nprofits   or  money  dedicated   to  the  upcoming   purchase  of\n\ncontraband,   a  sentencing  court  may  convert  the  cash  into\n\nequivalent  amounts of narcotics for \"relevant conduct\" purposes.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   2D1.4, comment. (n.2) (authorizing district courts\n   \n\nto use price as a means of approximating drug quantity); see also\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     34The court actually found that Johnson's two trips involved\n16 ounces per trip.   But, this finding utilized an impermissible\nprocess of rote averaging.  See supra  Part XI(B).  Hence, we use\n                                     \nthe low end of the range  of available estimates for purposes  of\nappellate review.\n\n                                82\n\nUnited States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 510 (1st Cir. 1993); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

So it is here.\n\n          Johnson's  third salvo also  flies wide of  the target.\n\nShe insists that the cash did not belong to her and, thus, cannot\n\nfigure  in  her  sentence.   But  as  we  read  the  record,  the\n\ncircumstantial  evidence   supports  a  finding   of  proprietary\n\ninterest.   And, moreover, even  if we were  to give credence  to\n\nJohnson's  protest  regarding  ownership,  the  cash  equivalency\n\nevidence could  be used against  her as  long as  the drug  money\n\nconstituted part  of the same common  scheme or plan  and met the\n\nforeseeability  requirement   for  relevant  conduct   under  the\n\nguidelines.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15; Blanco, 888 F.2d at 910-\n                                               \n\n11; see also  supra Part  XI(A) (discussing  relevant conduct  in\n                   \n\nconspiracy  cases).    The  evidence  here  could  reasonably  be\n\ninterpreted as  placing the  cash stash within  the orbit  of the\n\nconspiracy.   For these reasons, we detect  no clear error in the\n\nlower  court's conclusion  that the  money ought  properly to  be\n\ntreated  as  a  proxy  for  cocaine  and  counted   against  this\n\nappellant.\n\n          Johnson  has two  final  items  in  her  asseverational\n\narray.  She asserts that the court should have reduced her BOL by\n\ntwo levels since  she was merely a minor participant  in the drug\n\ndistribution scheme, see  U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b), and that  the court\n                        \n\nshould  have departed downward  due to her  family circumstances.\n\n                                83\n\nNeither assertion has much firepower.\n\n          As  to   the  former   plaint,  a   role-in-the-offense\n\nreduction,  even if granted, would  have no effect on appellant's\n\nsentence  due to the  overriding force  of the  mandatory minimum\n\nprescribed by 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  See U.S.S.G.   5G1.1(b)\n                                             \n\n(providing that  the statutorily required  minimum sentence shall\n\nbe  the  guideline  sentence  when  it exceeds  the  top  of  the\n\napplicable GSR).  The assignment of error is, therefore, moot.\n\n          As  to  Johnson's last  point,  it is  settled  in this\n\ncircuit  that a  sentencing  judge's  informed  decision  not  to\n\ndepart, regardless of direction, is a non-appealable event.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Tardiff, 969  F.2d 1283, 1290 (1st  Cir. 1992);\n                         \n\nUnited  States v.  Hilton, 946  F.2d  955, 957  (1st Cir.  1991).\n                         \n\nThere is nothing about  appellant's case that extricates it  from\n\nthe vice-like  grip of this  jurisdictional rule.  In  any event,\n\nappellant failed  to seek  a departure below  and, hence,  cannot\n\nbroach the matter for the first  time on appeal.  See Ortiz,  966\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at  717 (reiterating  rule  that appellate  court  will not\n\naddress  sentencing arguments that  were not  seasonably advanced\n\nbelow); United States v.  Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55  (1st Cir. 1991)\n                               \n\n(similar).\n\nXII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go  no  further.   After  considering all  the\n\nissues   raised  by   appellants,  including   some  issues   not\n\nspecifically  discussed herein, we  have unearthed no  vestige of\n\nreversible error.    Appellants' convictions  and  sentences  are\n\n                                84\n\ntherefore lawful, save only for the sentences imposed on Rood and\n\nWallace.   Accordingly, we affirm  the convictions  of those  two\n\nappellants, vacate their sentences,  and remand for resentencing.\n\nAt the same  time, we affirm the convictions and sentences of the\n\nother eight appellants.   We stay issuance of mandate in  all the\n\nappeals, pending publication  of the two additional  (and closely\n\nrelated) opinions described supra note 2.\n                                 \n\n          The  convictions  and  sentences  of  appellants  David\n                                                                 \n\nSepulveda,  Edgar  Sepulveda,  Edward W.

The convictions\n                                                                 \n\nof appellants  Tony  Rood and  William D.  Wallace are  affirmed,\n                                                                 \n\ntheir sentences  are vacated, and,  as to those  appellants only,\n                                                                 \n\nthe case is  remanded for resentencing.

Further  facts will be added as\n      \n\nwe discuss specific issues.\n\n          For  almost  six  years, David  Sepulveda  conducted an\n\nincreasingly sophisticated  cocaine distribution business  in and\n\naround Manchester, New Hampshire.  Initially, Sepulveda purchased\n\ncocaine from  a vendor in Nashua, New  Hampshire, and transported\n\nit  to Manchester  himself.   Over time,  Sepulveda expanded  his\n\noperation, increasing the  volume of cocaine and  engaging others\n\nto handle tasks such as pickup, delivery, and street-level sales.\n\n          As his  enterprise grew more ambitious, Sepulveda began\n\npurchasing  cocaine from  a  source  in Lawrence,  Massachusetts.\n\nFaced with the  need to retain  control while insulating  himself\n\nfrom  the prying eyes  of law enforcement  personnel, Sepulveda's\n\njourneys to Lawrence became an elaborate ritual in which he would\n\n                                4\n\nscrupulously avoid carrying  drugs or travelling in  the same car\n\nwith the cocaine that he purchased.  On these provisioning trips,\n\nSepulveda was usually  accompanied by his  brother, Edgar, and  a\n\n\"runner,\" that is, an individual who would actually transport the\n\ncocaine  from  Lawrence  to  Manchester.1    Frequently,  one  of\n\nSepulveda's  distributors  or a  user  in a  particular  hurry to\n\nobtain fresh supplies would join the troupe.\n\n          Once the cocaine arrived  in Manchester, Sepulveda  and\n\nhis  associates  packaged  it   in  street-level  quantities  and\n\ndistributed it to a series of individuals for resale and personal\n\nuse.   The buyers included,  among others,  defendants Edward  W.\n\nWelch,  Jr., Arline  S.  Welch,  Shane  Welch,  Kevin  Cullinane,\n\nChristopher Driesse, Cheryl  T. Johnson, Richard E.  Labrie, Tony\n\nRood, and William D. Wallace.  David Sepulveda made a practice of\n\ndirecting  persons who inquired about purchasing small amounts of\n\ncocaine to these same individuals.\n\n          Eventually, David Sepulveda's reach exceeded his grasp.\n\nA federal  grand jury indicted  him, along with others,  for drug\n\ntrafficking;  and, after  trial, a  petit  jury convicted  twelve\n\npersons,  viz.,  the  Sepulveda  brothers,  the  three   Welches,\n              \n\nCullinane, Driesse, Johnson, Labrie, Rood, Wallace, and Langlois,\n\non a charge of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  See\n                                                                 \n\n21 U.S.C.    846 (1988).  The jury also convicted David Sepulveda\n\non a charge of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     1At  various times,  defendants  Tony  Rood  and  Ernest  F.\nLanglois  worked as  runners.   At  other  times, Norberto  Perez\nplayed this role.\n\n                                5\n\n21 U.S.C.   848 (1988).  Twenty-six appeals ensued.\n\n          It  is  no  exaggeration to  say  that  the defendants,\n\nrepresented by able  counsel, managed to cultivate a profusion of\n\nvariegated  grounds for appeal  from the  peat of  the protracted\n\ntrial.    Because  of  the  sheer  bulk  and  complexity  of  the\n\nproceedings, we issued  a special briefing  order and then  heard\n\noral argument on all twenty-six  appeals.  We decide today twelve\n\nappeals   taken    by   ten   defendants    (collectively,   \"the\n\nappellants\").2  After sifting what  grains we can locate from the\n\nconsiderable chaff,  we conclude  that the  appellants enjoyed  a\n\nfair, substantially error-free trial, and  that their convictions\n\nmust  stand.   In two  instances, however,  we  vacate particular\n\nsentences and remand for further proceedings.\n\nII.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Four   appellants   claim   that    the   evidence   is\n\ninsufficient,  as a matter of law, to support their convictions.3\n\nBecause insufficiency claims are commonplace in criminal appeals,\n\nthe   standard  of  appellate  oversight  lends  itself  to  rote\n\n                    \n\n     2The  appeals taken  by defendants  Christopher Driesse  and\nShane Welch following the trial present certain unique issues and\nthose two  appeals will  be resolved in  a separate opinion.   In\naddition, after the  original round of appeals had been docketed,\nall twelve  defendants moved to  vacate judgment on the  basis of\nnewly discovered evidence.

Kurt  Coriaty\n\ntestified that he had purchased cocaine from her both in her home\n\nand  in his,  particularly after  her husband, Edward  Welch, was\n\nimprisoned.  Coriaty's partner, Kenneth Milne, stated that Arline\n\nWelch  gave  him cocaine  at  her home  and was  present  when he\n\npurchased  cocaine  from  Edward Welch  at  the  Welch residence.\n\nWhile mere presence is not sufficient to ground criminal charges,\n\na defendant's presence at the point of a drug sale, taken  in the\n\nlight of attendant circumstances, can constitute strong  evidence\n\nof complicity.  See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711-12.\n                         \n\n          The  jury also heard Norberto Perez explain that Arline\n\nWelch  accompanied David Sepulveda on three buying expeditions to\n\nLawrence,  Massachusetts.   Perez testified  that, in  expressing\n\nanxiety, she made  manifest her awareness of the  trips' purpose,\n\nvoicing statements like:  \"Let's hurry up and get this cocaine so\n\n                                8\n\nwe can get out of  here.\"  Furthermore, Randall Vetrone testified\n\nthat  Arline Welch  was present  in  Edgar Sepulveda's  apartment\n\nwhile  the   Sepulveda  brothers   packaged  and   sold  cocaine.\n\nAppellant's consensual presence in a  private home, not her  own,\n\nwhile large quantities of  drugs were being packaged for  resale,\n\npossessed evidentiary significance.

When an appellate  court reviews the sufficiency of\nthe  evidence, it must  resolve routine credibility  questions in\nfavor of the verdict.  See David, 940 F.2d at 730.\n                                \n\n                                9\n\ndrug distribution  trade, testified that Cullinane introduced him\n\nto  David  Sepulveda  and  that  Sepulveda  eventually  became  a\n\nprincipal   supplier   of   cocaine   to   the   Cullinane-Santos\n\npartnership.  Santos  also testified  that Cullinane  accompanied\n\nSepulveda on provisioning trips, returning to  Santos's apartment\n\nwith fresh supplies of contraband.  The ubiquitous Norberto Perez\n\ncorroborated  this relationship, testifying that he had travelled\n\nto  Lawrence  on  at  least  five occasions  in  the  company  of\n\nCullinane  and the  Sepulveda  siblings  in  order  to  replenish\n\ncocaine stores.   Perez also  recreated a conversation  that took\n\nplace  between  Cullinane and  Sepulveda  involving  the former's\n\nindebtedness to the latter for transactions in cocaine.\n\n          The government adduced abundant evidence that Cullinane\n\ndistributed much of the contraband he acquired.  Perez and Santos\n\nboth described Cullinane's  activities as  a vendor.   John  Rice\n\ntestified   that  Cullinane   delivered   cocaine  to   defendant\n\nChristopher Driesse, and that Driesse,  in turn, would resell the\n\ndrugs.  Santos confirmed that Cullinane procured these drugs from\n\nDavid  Sepulveda and that Sepulveda extended credit to Cullinane.\n\nAnother  witness, David Chase, acknowledged that he had purchased\n\nup to eight kilograms of cocaine from Cullinane before concluding\n\nthat,  aphorisms  about   honor  among  thieves  notwithstanding,\n\nCullinane could not be trusted.5\n\n          In  view of  this  plenitudinous  testimony, the  court\n\n                    \n\n     5When Chase and Cullinane fell  out, Chase took his business\ndirectly to David Sepulveda.\n\n                                10\n\nbelow appropriately derailed Cullinane's quest for acquittal as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n                       C.  Ernest Langlois.\n                                          \n\n          David  Sepulveda hired  Langlois  to  be  both  a  drug\n\ncourier  and  a torpedo.   Langlois's  resounding success  in the\n\nlatter  role    intimidating Sepulveda's debtors  and, sometimes,\n\nhis  associates    produced  a  suffusion  of  testimony  limning\n\nLanglois's role in  the organization.   For instance, David  Hill\n\ndescribed four occasions on which Langlois used force, or threats\n\nof  force,  to  collect  debts  owed to  Sepulveda.    Two  other\n\nwitnesses testified that Sepulveda boasted of  employing Langlois\n\nas a strongarm to collect  drug debts.  Another witness overheard\n\nLanglois  crowing about  the nature  of his  employment.   And no\n\nfewer  than  six  witnesses  relayed  information  from  which  a\n\nrational jury  could infer  that Langlois  \"rode shotgun\"  during\n\ndrug-buying expeditions.\n\n          As  this  partial   summary  indicates,  the   evidence\n\naccumulated  against Langlois rose well above the level necessary\n\nto sustain the jury's verdict.\n\n                       D.  Cheryl Johnson.\n                                         \n\n          Two witnesses, Santos and  Kathy Malone (an  undercover\n\npolice  officer), testified  that David  Sepulveda  sent them  to\n\nCheryl Johnson when they wanted to buy cocaine.  Santos said that\n\nhe  purchased cocaine from  Johnson on approximately  one hundred\n\noccasions, during which transactions Johnson offhandedly revealed\n\n                                11\n\nthe full extent of her  copious cocaine inventory.  Malone stated\n\nthat  she purchased  cocaine from  Johnson  on three  occasions.6\n\nPerez  testified that  he,  too,  bought  cocaine  from  Johnson,\n\ndelivered  cocaine  to   Johnson  at   Sepulveda's  behest,   and\n\naccompanied her on at least one buying trip to Lawrence.\n\n          Although Johnson argues  vehemently that the  witnesses\n\nagainst  her were inherently  unreliable, courts must  leave such\n\ncredibility determinations in the jury's  domain.  See David, 940\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  730.   Here,  the jury  was  at liberty  to  credit the\n\ntestimony, and it,  in turn, supplied all  the elements necessary\n\nto convict.\n\nIII.  SEQUESTRATION\n\n          Appellants claim  that, shortly after  sentencing, they\n\nlearned for the  first time that the government  housed three key\n\nwitnesses (Perez, Milne, and Coriaty) in the same cell throughout\n\nthe trial.  Appellants moved for a  new trial,7 alleging that the\n\nhousing arrangements violated a sequestration order issued by the\n\ndistrict  court.  The  government not only  contested appellants'\n\nconclusion but also contested the premise on which the conclusion\n\n                    \n\n     6Both  Santos and  Malone also  testified  that they  bought\ncocaine from defendant Richard Labrie at Johnson's abode.\n\n     7These motions are separate from,  and much earlier in  time\nthan,  the  motions  to  which  we  alluded  in  note  2,  supra.\n                                                                \nNonetheless,  these motions, like the later motions, invoked Fed.\nR. Crim.  P. 33. We  grant appellants a  considerable indulgence,\nassuming arguendo that the  information concerning the witnesses'\n                 \nliving arrangements was  not discoverable before or  during trial\nwith the exercise of due diligence.

R.  Evid. 615.   The rule  more or less  codifies common-law\n\nsequestration powers, but  it is at  once less discretionary  and\n\nless stringent  than its forebears.

As a\n\npractical  matter,  district  courts  routinely  exercise   their\n\ndiscretion  to augment Rule 615 by instructing witnesses, without\n\nmaking  fine spatial distinctions,  that they are  not to discuss\n\ntheir  testimony.     Indeed,  such  non-discussion   orders  are\n\ngenerally  thought  to   be  a  standard  concomitant   of  basic\n\nsequestration fare, serving to fortify the protections offered by\n\n                    \n\nappellants' thesis.\n\n                                15\n\nRule 615.

The court granted the motion\n\nin   its  simplest   aspect,   directing  counsel   \"to   monitor\n\nsequestration\"  and ordering \"that  witnesses who are  subject to\n\n[the court's] order are not to be present in the courtroom at any\n\ntime prior to  their appearance to render testimony.\"   At trial,\n\nthe district court expanded its earlier order beyond the Rule 615\n\nminimum,  instructing each  witness at  the close  of his  or her\n\ntestimony  not to discuss that  testimony with any other witness.\n\nAppellants accepted the conditions of sequestration described  by\n\nthe court  without demurrer.  What is  more, they did not request\n\nany further instructions, say, that witnesses  be directed at the\n\nend of each  day, or  before each  recess, not  to discuss  their\n\ntestimony.    Thus,  every  witness was  placed  under  an  order\n\nprohibiting discussion of the case with other witnesses only upon\n\nthe completion of his or her testimony.\n\n          On these facts,  the district court's denial  of relief\n\nmust be  upheld.   The court's  basic sequestration order,  which\n\nploughed a straight furrow in line with Rule 615  itself, did not\n\nextend beyond the  courtroom.  There has been  no intimation that\n\nthe witnesses  transgressed this  order.   Moreover, because  the\n\ndistrict  court  did   not  promulgate  a  non-discussion   order\n\napplicable to any witness until  the conclusion of that witness's\n\n                                16\n\ntestimony,  Perez, Milne, and  Coriaty were under  no obligation,\n\nprior   to  that  moment,   to  refrain  from   discussing  their\n\nrecollections with  each other.   Finally,  there is no  evidence\n\nthat any of  the three ever chatted  about the case  with another\n\nwitness after having been admonished to the  contrary   or at any\n\nearlier time, for that matter.\n\n          Given this predicate, appellants' plaint reduces to the\n\nunprecedented proposition  that witness  cohabitation constitutes\n\nan automatic violation  of a standard  sequestration order.   The\n\ncrux   of  sequestration,   however,  is   communication  between\n\nwitnesses,  not shared  accommodations  or geographic  proximity.\n\nSocial  settings, such as communal  housing or common work sites,\n\nmay offer opportunities for witnesses to compare notes and gossip\n\nabout their testimony, but  such environments do not ensure  that\n\nforbidden  conversations will occur.   We assume  that witnesses,\n\nlike all other  persons subject to court orders,  will follow the\n\ninstructions they receive.   Cf., e.g., Richardson  v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206  (1987) (reiterating the \"invariable  assumption of\n\nthe law  that jurors follow  their instructions\").   We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that  the housing arrangement,  in and of  itself, did\n\nnot violate an existing sequestration order.\n\n          If  doubt inhered    and we see  no room for  any   two\n\nother considerations would then be decisive.

Here,  the district court ruled that congregant\n\nhousing of witnesses did not  infringe on the sequestration  that\n\nit decreed.  When a trial court's interpretation of its own order\n\ntracks plain language  and the  actual sequence  of events,  that\n\ninterpretation must be honored on appeal.\n\n          In  the  second place,  even  if  some implied  ban  on\n\ncongregant  housing of  prisoner-witnesses existed,  breach of  a\n\nsequestration order would not automatically call for a new trial;\n\nrather,  the need  for  a sanction,  and  the nature  of one,  if\n\nimposable,  are  matters  committed to  the  trial  court's sound\n\ndiscretion.

Appellants'  failure to\n                   \n\nrequest  a   broader  sequestration   order,  coupled  with   the\n\nspeculative nature of their claim of actual prejudice, renders it\n\nimpossible  to find  an abuse  of  discretion here.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nRossetti, 768 F.2d at 16.\n        \n\n          To  sum up,  our  search  of the  record  in this  case\n\ndiscloses  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  government or  its\n\nwitnesses  transgressed the existing sequestration order.  And as\n\nwe   have  indicated,  if  appellants  desired  a  more  vigorous\n\nsequestration  regime, such  as an  edict that would  have banned\n\ncohabitation or  other contact  amongst prisoner-witnesses,  they\n\nhad a  duty to ask for  it.  They failed  to do so.   Under these\n\ncircumstances,  the  district  court  appropriately  declined  to\n\n                                18\n\noverturn the  convictions.

Patrolling these boundaries is  primarily the duty of\n\nthe  nisi prius  court.   Because  the district  judge is  better\n               \n\nattuned to  the  nuances of  the trial,  this court  must take  a\n\ndeferential view of rulings made in the course of that patrol.\n\n          When discovery  material makes a belated  appearance, a\n\ncriminal  defendant  must  ordinarily seek  a  continuance  if he\n\nintends to claim prejudice.   A continuance affords time to study\n\nthe   newly   emergent   information,   consider   its   possible\n\nramifications, change trial  strategy (if necessary),  assess any\n\npotential   prejudice,  and  determine   how  best  to   use  the\n\ninformation.

Hence,  we  find  appellants' delayed  discovery\n\nclaims, with one exception, to have been waived.\n\n          The   facts   referable  to   the   remaining  dilatory\n\ndisclosure  claim can be  succinctly summarized.   Perez not only\n\nworked as a  courier for David Sepulveda, but  also supported his\n\nown cocaine  habit by peddling  drugs.  After he  was apprehended\n\nfor selling cocaine,  Perez agreed to testify  against appellants\n\nin  return for  the United  States Attorney's  help in  seeking a\n\n                                21\n\nreduced sentence.   Since Perez was the only witness who tied all\n\nthe  defendants  to  David Sepulveda's  illicit  enterprise,  his\n\ntestimony was extremely important to the government's case.\n\n          When  defense lawyers  began cross-examining  Perez, it\n\nbecame  apparent that  the  FBI  records  furnished  in  pretrial\n\ndiscovery  did not  list Perez's  entire  repertoire of  criminal\n\nconvictions,   especially  those   stemming   from  state   court\n\nproceedings and not reported to the FBI.  When Perez acknowledged\n\nthat a state probation officer had prepared a presentence  report\n\nfor a New Hampshire court,  appellants asked for a continuance so\n\nthat  they might  obtain  this document  and more  fully research\n\nPerez's  criminal history.  The  district court denied the motion\n\nbut offered  to permit  the defense to  recall Perez  for further\n\ncross-questioning should  the new  information warrant  it.   The\n\ntrial continued coincident  with the defense's efforts  to secure\n\nthe presentence report.\n\n          After some travail, New Hampshire authorities agreed to\n\nrelease the report to  the federal court in camera.  The district\n                                                  \n\njudge  found  that it  contained  little  fresh material  but  he\n\nnonetheless issued  a turnover order.   The defense  received the\n\nreport while  Perez was still  on the  witness stand.   The judge\n\nrefused to grant a mistrial  or afford appellants any  comparable\n\nredress.\n\n          We see no error.  The  prosecution was caught unawares;\n\nit never knew of the report's existence and, therefore, could not\n\nhave deliberately withheld it.   Furthermore, the rigors of Brady\n                                                                 \n\n                                22\n\ndo  not   usually  attach   to  material   outside  the   federal\n\ngovernment's  control   and the presentence  report at issue here\n\nfalls within  the scope  of this generality.

See  Devin, 918 F.2d  at 290\n                                               \n\n(refusing  to  reverse  conviction  where delayed  disclosure  of\n\nimpeachment  material  \"had no  effect  on  the  outcome  of  the\n\ntrial\"); Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 411-12 (stating  that the critical\n                 \n\ntest \"is whether defendant's  counsel was prevented by the  delay\n\nfrom  using the disclosed  material effectively in  preparing and\n\npresenting  the defendant's case\").  Here, however, the defense's\n\ndelayed receipt of the report did not hinder cross-examination to\n\nany appreciable degree.  From  the start of trial, appellants had\n\na  sizeable storehouse of data concerning Perez's checkered past.\n\nIn comparison  to  what  was  already known,  the  report,  which\n\nyielded  a  relatively  inconsequential   amount  of  incremental\n\ninformation, comprised small  potatoes.  Moreover, the  timing of\n\nevents  minimized  the  possibility  of  prejudice.    Appellants\n\nreceived the report while Perez  was still testifying.  They were\n\nable to incorporate its contents into their cross-examination and\n\nemploy the information effectively.   For aught that appears, the\n\n                                23\n\ncourse  and outcome  of the  trial would  have  been the  same no\n\nmatter when the report surfaced.\n\n          In  our  view,  the  presider's  decision  to  allow  a\n\ncriminal case to  go forward, notwithstanding delayed  disclosure\n\nof  material relevant  to  impeachment of  a  witness, should  be\n\nupheld unless a  manifest abuse of discretion looms.

On this  record, we can neither  criticize the\n\ndistrict court's exercise  of its informed discretion  nor tamper\n\nwith the court's  bipartite finding that the  government violated\n\nno  duty  and  that,  in   any  event,  appellants  sustained  no\n\ncognizable  prejudice  arising out  of  the  presentence report's\n\nbelated emergence.\n\n                      B.

COCONSPIRATORS' STATEMENTS\n\n          During the course  of trial, the judge  allowed several\n\nwitnesses to  attribute out-of-court  statements to  one or  more\n\ndeclarants,   finding,  inter  alia,  that  the  declarants  were\n                                   \n\ncoconspirators.  Appellants assign error.\n\n          Although out-of-court statements made by non-testifying\n\ndeclarants ordinarily are excluded as hearsay if offered to prove\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted, see Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), there\n                                     \n\nare exceptions  to the rule.  One such exception provides that \"a\n\nstatement by a coconspirator of a  party during the course and in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy\" is  not hearsay.   Fed.  R. Evid\n\n801(d)(2)(E).   To  invoke the  exception, a  party who  wants to\n\nintroduce  a particular statement must show by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that  a conspiracy embracing both  the declarant and\n\nthe  defendant  existed,  and  that  the  declarant  uttered  the\n\nstatement  during and  in  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.

The common thread that joins\n\nthese proffers is that the government adduced some other evidence\n\ntending   to   prove   that  the   declarants   were,   in  fact,\n\ncoconspirators.  We then address two pieces of testimony that are\n\nnot cushioned in a comparable fashion.\n\n                    A.  Supported Statements.\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     11On a sixth occasion, defendant Driesse objected to another\nstatement.   Inasmuch as that statement implicated Driesse alone,\nwe regard the  ensuing assignment of error as beyond the scope of\nthis opinion.  See supra note 2.\n                        \n\n                                26\n\n          1.     Milne  Testimony.     Milne  (a   self-confessed\n          1.     Milne  Testimony.\n                                 \n\ncoconspirator) served as  the wellspring of the  first statement.\n\nHe testified  that a defendant,  Edward Welch, told him  that the\n\npolice  noticed cocaine  on his  (Welch's) bed  in the  course of\n\nexecuting a  search warrant.   The district court found  that the\n\ndeclarant, Welch, was a coconspirator, and that Welch's statement\n\nwas  made during  and  in  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.   The\n\nfinding is fully sustainable.\n\n          Both Coriaty and  Milne testified that Welch  sold them\n\ncocaine he  had purchased  from David  Sepulveda (an  arrangement\n\nthat  numerous  other  witnesses  corroborated).   This  evidence\n\nencourages,  if it  does not  demand, the  conclusion  that Welch\n\nworked hand  in glove with  Sepulveda.   A pattern of  drug sales\n\nbetween  two individuals, looking toward resale to third persons,\n\ntogether  with  appropriate  contextual  detail,  can  support  a\n\nfinding that the two individuals were jointly involved in a drug-\n\ntrafficking conspiracy.

In  each\n\ninstance, there appears to be  no record evidence, other than the\n\nstatement itself, to support its admissibility.\n\n          One statement arose during the government's examination\n\nof  a police  detective, Mark  Putney.   The detective  testified\n\nthat, while executing a search  warrant at a dwelling occupied by\n\ndefendant Cheryl Johnson and her  husband, Brian, he answered the\n\ntelephone:\n\n          The  male caller asked if  Brian was home.  I\n          stated  I was Brian.   The caller  stated did\n          you pick  up the stuff.   I said I did.   The\n          caller asked if  he could come over  and pick\n          up a half.  I stated sure, come on over.\n\n          The other statement occurred  during direct examination\n\nof  Joseph  Baranski.    Baranski  testified  that  he  sometimes\n\nprovided  transportation for  people going  to David  Sepulveda's\n\nhouse and that,  on occasion, his passengers would  tell him that\n\nthey were  visiting Sepulveda  because \"they  wanted to  buy some\n\ndrugs.\"\n\n          Our  review of the  record has deterrated  no extrinsic\n\nevidence  tending to show that these out-of-court declarants (the\n\nunidentified caller to the Johnson residence and the unidentified\n\npassengers   in  Baranski's   vehicle)  were   involved  in   the\n\nconspiracy, and the government has  directed us to no such proof.\n\nFollowing  the Supreme Court's landmark opinion in Bourjaily, and\n                                                            \n\n                                29\n\nJustice Stevens's concurrence, 483 U.S.  at 185 &amp; n.2, several of\n\nour  sister circuits  have concluded  that  the preponderance  of\n\nevidence  required  for  the   introduction  of  an  out-of-court\n\nstatement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) must  necessarily comprise more\n\nthan  the weight  of the  statement  itself.

Thus,  because the  government\n\ndeveloped  no independent evidence of who Brian Johnson's callers\n\n                                30\n\nor Joseph  Baranski's passengers might  have been, or  what their\n\nstatus  might have  been vis-a-vis  the  charged conspiracy,  the\n\nstatements  were  improperly  admitted  under  the  coconspirator\n\nexception to the hearsay rule.13\n\n          There   is  no  bright-line   rule  for  divining  when\n\nparticular errors that  result in a  jury's exposure to  improper\n\nevidence are  (or  are not)  harmless.   Rather,  a  harmlessness\n\ndetermination   demands   a  panoramic,   case-specific   inquiry\n\nconsidering,  among other things,  the centrality of  the tainted\n\nmaterial, its  uniqueness, its  prejudicial impact,  the uses  to\n\nwhich it was put during the trial, the relative  strengths of the\n\nparties'  cases,  and any  telltales  that furnish  clues  to the\n\nlikelihood that the error affected the factfinder's resolution of\n\na  material issue.   Gearing  our inquiry  along these  lines, we\n\nconclude that the errors in admitting  the statements are benign.\n\nThe  telephone  talk  concerned a  peripheral  matter,  for Brian\n\nJohnson  was  not  on  trial.    Furthermore,  several  witnesses\n\ntestified at first  hand that his  wife and housemate,  appellant\n\nCheryl Johnson,  trafficked in  cocaine.

They\n\n                    \n\n     13We  do not mean to imply  that the evidence might not have\nbeen introduced for  some other purpose.   Suppose, for  example,\nthat the telephone calls Putney received were not offered to show\nthat someone in fact sought to buy drugs from Brian Johnson, but,\nrather,  to  show  the  types  of telephone  calls  the  Johnsons\nreceived.  If admissible on  that basis, the statements would not\nbe excludable as  hearsay.  See  Fed. R.

EXPERT TESTIMONY\n\n          At  trial,  the  government's  case culminated  in  the\n\ntestimony of Commander  Richard Gerry of  the New Hampshire  Drug\n\nTask Force.   Before  Commander Gerry  testified, the  prosecutor\n\ntold the  court that Gerry's views would  be based upon the trial\n\ntestimony and his experience  as a police officer,  and predicted\n\nthat Gerry would \"explain to the jury how the quantities of drugs\n\n. . . referred to in the . . . testimony at trial [were] used and\n\ndistributed  . .  . from  the business  aspect.\"   Based  on this\n\nrepresentation, the court denied appellants' motion in limine and\n                                                             \n\npermitted the witness to testify. \n\n                    \n\n     14Appellants  also assign error to four statements that were\nadmitted without objection.  Absent a showing of plain error, the\nfailure  to object  below  is  fatal  to claims  that  particular\nevidence should not have reached  the jury.  See Ortiz,  966 F.2d\n                                                      \nat 715; Perkins, 926 F.2d at 1283; see also Fed. R.

Despite this  promising start,\n\nmatters  soon deteriorated.    Although Commander  Gerry  offered\n\nopinions   as   to   appellants'   roles   in   the   enterprise,\n\ncharacterizing David  Sepulveda as  \"top dog\"  and the  others as\n\nrank-and-file  members  of  the  organization,  cross-examination\n\nrevealed that  these opinions  were less the  fruit of  an expert\n\nmind  attuned to  the  testimony in  the case  than the  yield of\n\nundifferentiated conversations over  the years with  unidentified\n\npolice  officers  regarding  Sepulveda and  his  associates.   So\n\ningrained were  the roots of  Commander Gerry's opinions  that he\n\nwas unable to specify the sources  of his information or, in  the\n\nend, articulate a plausible basis for his views.  The speculative\n\nnature  of Gerry's  testimony became  starkly  apparent when  the\n\ndefense established that he had heard only bits and pieces of the\n\ntestimony  in the  case.   These rather  startling insights  cast\n\ngrave doubt  upon both  the adequacy of  the foundation  on which\n\nGerry's testimony rested  and the existence of a fair opportunity\n\nfor effective cross-questioning.\n\n          Midway through  cross-examination the defense  moved to\n\nstrike  the  expert's  testimony in  toto.    The district  court\n                                         \n\ngranted  the  motion.   We  think  the  defects in  the  expert's\n\npresentation warranted this step.   Fed. R. Evid. 705 provides in\n\n                                33\n\npertinent part  that an expert witness \"may .  . . be required to\n\ndisclose  [on cross-examination] the underlying facts or data\" on\n\nwhich  his opinions rest.   If cross-examination reveals that the\n\nopinions  advanced  by  an  expert rest  on  a  wholly inadequate\n\nfoundation,  the  judge,   on  timely  motion,  may   strike  the\n\ntestimony.

The\n                     \n\nwitness's opinions need  \"not [be] based on  first-hand knowledge\n\nor observation.\"  Id. at 2796.\n                     \n\n          Seen  in light of these authorities, the district court\n\nhad  a reasonable basis for  allowing the expert  to testify.  If\n\nCommander  Gerry's pedagogy  proved  to  be  as  advertised,  his\n\ntestimony  arguably would have assisted the jury in understanding\n\nthe   voluminous  evidence   that  had   emerged.     Experienced\n\ninvestigators are  commonly permitted  to testify  as experts  on\n\ntopics  such  as the  structure  of  a  criminal enterprise,  the\n\neconomics  of the  drug trade,  and the  handling of  contraband.\n\n                                35\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

The exercise  of  that\n             \n\ndiscretion always  must be informed  by the circumstances  of the\n\nparticular case.   When, as now, a  motion to declare  a mistrial\n\nhas its genesis in a claim that improper evidence came before the\n\njury, the court must first weigh the claim of impropriety and, if\n\nthat claim is well founded, strike the offending evidence.  Next,\n\nunless   the  court  believes  that  the  evidence  is  seriously\n\nprejudicial   and  that  a   curative  instruction  will   be  an\n\ninsufficient  antidote, the court  should proceed with  the trial\n\nafter instructing the jury to disregard the  evidence.  Declaring\n\na mistrial is  a last resort, only to be implemented if the taint\n\nis ineradicable, that  is, only if the trial  judge believes that\n\nthe jury's  exposure to  the evidence is  likely to  prove beyond\n\nrealistic hope of repair.\n\n                                37\n\n          In this  instance, Judge  Devine followed the  standard\n\nparadigm as closely as possible, considering appellants' delay in\n\noffering the mistrial motion.   Three factors persuade us that he\n\nhandled  the situation in  an appropriate manner.   First, courts\n\nhave long recognized that, within wide margins, the potential for\n\nprejudice stemming  from improper  testimony or  comments can  be\n\nsatisfactorily  dispelled by  appropriate curative  instructions.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.

So it is\n                                 \n\nhere.   Appellants have not successfully rebutted the presumption\n\nthat the jury heeded the judge's instructions.\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to save the day, appellants come\n\nat the question  of undue prejudice from a  slightly more oblique\n\n                    \n\n     16It  is,  perhaps,  worth noting  that  the  only defendant\ndiscussed in  any detail by the  witness was David Sepulveda    a\ndefendant   as  to  whom  the  prosecution  adduced  overwhelming\nevidence of  guilt.  We  add that, although there  were different\nquanta of evidence as to  each defendant, a painstaking review of\nthe  record inspires  confidence that  Gerry's  testimony had  no\nsignificant spillover effect vis-a-vis other defendants.\n\n                                39\n\nangle.     They  allege  that  the  government's  questioning  of\n\nCommander Gerry went  so far beyond the limits  of propriety that\n\nputting  him on  the  witness  stand  amounted  to  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.    But  the  record  simply  does  not  support  this\n\naccusation.  The government  had a reasonable basis for  offering\n\nGerry as an expert  witness.  Although  the decision did not  pan\n\nout, that is no  reason to consign either  the prosecutor or  the\n\nprosecution to the juridical equivalent of  philotheoparoptesism.\n\nLike judges,  prosecutors cannot be  held to a standard  of utter\n\nprescience.17 \n\n          For these reasons, we discern no abuse of discretion in\n\neither  the  district  court's  initial  admission  of  Commander\n\nGerry's  testimony or the  court's refusal to  declare a mistrial\n\nafter  the  necessity  to  strike  the testimony  arose.    In  a\n\nnutshell, there was no reason to  believe that the infelicitously\n\noffered evidence  remained  in the  jurors'  minds after  it  was\n\nbanished from the case, and,  consequently, no need for the court\n\nto jettison the baby when the bath water turned tepid.\n\nVII.  CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\n          Appellants  contend  that   the  prosecutors'  comments\n\n                    \n\n     17Moreover,  if blame  is to  be  assigned, appellants  must\nshare in it.  They could have,  but did not, ask for a voir dire.\n                                                                \nSee supra note 15.

See id.  In this  way, the prosecution can\n                              \n\nclarify  ambiguities and correct mislocutions in a timely manner,\n\nand,  if necessary, the  trial judge can  administer an immediate\n\nantidote, thereby curtailing any damage.\n\n          None of the appellants chose to testify at trial.  Yet,\n\nthe prosecutors courted trouble in both segments of their closing\n\nargument.  Initially, one of them asked rhetorically:\n\n          Did anyone come  into this courtroom and  say\n          what the Government witnesses told you didn't\n          happen?    Did  they?    They   attacked  the\n          witnesses, the DEA, the police officers, [and\n          the government attorneys]. . . .\n\nOn rebuttal, her colleague expanded upon (and twice repeated) the\n\nsame theme:\n\n          The  United   States  introduced  a   lot  of\n          evidence during  this trial, a  lot of facts.\n          And for the  most part, there is  no evidence\n          in  this case to show that what our witnesses\n          said happened did  not happen.  That  is, the\n          defendants  have  done little  or  nothing to\n          refute that evidence.\n\n                                42\n\n                       *        *        *\n\n          Ladies  and   gentlemen,  we  stand   on  the\n          evidence,  the  overwhelming   evidence,  the\n          evidence  which,  for  the   most  part,  the\n          defendants  have done  absolutely nothing  to\n          refute . . . .\n\nIt was only  after the jury had  been dismissed for the  day that\n\nappellants, having sat  silently throughout both segments  of the\n\nprosecutors'  summations, moved for  a mistrial based  in part on\n\nthe  quoted statements.   The  trial court  denied the  motion as\n\nuntimely and sent the case to the  jury the next morning.  In the\n\ncourse  of  the charge,  Judge  Devine  stated on  five  separate\n\noccasions  that the government  was responsible for  carrying the\n\nburden  of proof,  that the  defendants had  the right  to remain\n\nsilent,  and  that  no  inferences   might  be  drawn  from   the\n\ndefendants' election not to testify.19\n\n          In  assaying  the  appropriateness  of  a  prosecutor's\n\nremarks,  context  frequently  determines meaning.

The  government's closing  argument\n\nrecounted  the  evidence   against  each  defendant  and,   while\n\nadmitting that  certain prosecution witnesses  possessed unsavory\n\nreputations  and might  profit  by cooperation,  the  prosecutors\n\nurged the jury to find that those witnesses testified truthfully.\n\nNot  surprisingly,  defense  counsels' summations  played  up the\n\n                    \n\n     20In  this case,  the  district  court  apparently  did  not\nbelieve  that  the  prosecutors  intended  the  statements  as  a\nreflection on the  defendants' failure to testify  and appellants\nhave not imputed so malign a motive  to the prosecution team.

JURY NULLIFICATION\n\n          The   defendants   invoked   the   specter   of    jury\n\nnullification  during  final  arguments.    Labrie's  lawyer,  in\n\nparticular, invited the jury to \"send out  a question\" concerning\n\nthis doctrine.  Three non-events followed; the government did not\n\nobject to this  soliloquy, the district  court did not  intervene\n\nsua sponte,  and the court's  charge did not broach  the subject.\n          \n\nNevertheless, the deliberating jury took the invitation literally\n\n                                50\n\nand asked the judge to \"[c]larify the law on jury nullification.\"\n\nThe court responded by telling the jury:\n\n          Federal   trial  judges   are  forbidden   to\n          instruct on jury  nullification, because they\n          are  required  to instruct  only  on  the law\n          which applies to a case.  As I have indicated\n          to  you, the burden in each instance which is\n          here placed  upon the Government is  to prove\n          each element of the  offenses . . .  beyond a\n          reasonable  doubt,  and  in  the  event   the\n          Government  fails to  sustain  its burden  of\n          proof  beyond  a reasonable  doubt as  to any\n          essential  element  of  any  offense  charged\n          against each defendant, it has then failed in\n          its  burden of proof as to such defendant and\n          that defendant is to be acquitted.  In short,\n          if the Government proves its case against any\n          defendant, you should convict that defendant.\n          If it  fails to  prove its  case against  any\n          defendant you must acquit that defendant.\n\nAppellants objected to  this supplemental instruction.   They now\n\nargue that the instruction amounted to a wrongful repudiation  of\n\nthe time-honored concept of jury nullification.\n\n          The  applicable rule is  that, although  jurors possess\n\nthe  raw power to set  an accused free  for any reason  or for no\n\nreason, their duty is  to apply the law as  given to them by  the\n\ncourt.  See   United States v.  Boardman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  116 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1969),  cert. denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">991</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970).   Accordingly,\n                          \n\nwhile jurors may choose to  flex their muscles, ignoring both law\n\nand evidence in  a gadarene rush to acquit  a criminal defendant,\n\nneither the court nor counsel should encourage jurors to exercise\n\nthis power.

A  trial judge, therefore, may  block defense\n\nattorneys' attempts  to serenade  a jury with  the siren  song of\n\nnullification,  see United States  v. Garcia-Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                 \n\n                                51\n\n226 (1st  Cir. 1989); and, indeed,  may instruct the  jury on the\n\ndimensions of their duty to the exclusion of  jury nullification,\n\nsee Trujillo, 714 F.2d at 105-06 (collecting cases).\n            \n\n          To the extent that appellants, during closing argument,\n\nmanaged to  mention nullification,  they received  more than  was\n\ntheir  due.    Having  pocketed  this  gratuity,  appellants  now\n\ncomplain that they were  not allowed to capitalize  on it.   When\n\nthe jurors rose to the  bait, appellants say, Judge Devine should\n\nhave   assured  them   that  nullification   is  an   \"historical\n\nprerogative\"  of juries  from  time  immemorial.    We  disagree.\n\nThough jury nullification has a long and sometimes  storied past,\n\nsee Boardman, 419  F.2d at 116, the  case law makes plain  that a\n            \n\njudge may not  instruct the jury anent its  history, vitality, or\n\nuse.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Desmarais, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564779\"><a href=\"/opinion/564779/united-states-v-paul-desmarais/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir.  1991)  (collecting  cases).    This  proscription  is\n\ninvariant; it makes no difference that the jury inquired, or that\n\nan  aggressive  lawyer  managed  to  pique  a  particular  jury's\n\ncuriosity by mentioning the subject in closing argument, or  that\n\na napping prosecutor  failed to raise a timely  objection to that\n\nallusion.    Thus,  the  district  court  appropriately  scotched\n\nappellants' suggested jury instruction.\n\n          Appellants'  fallback  position     that  the  district\n\ncourt, if  disinclined to sing the praises of jury nullification,\n\nshould have  refrained from  giving any  supplemental instruction\n\nand,  instead, should have  stonewalled   is  not well conceived.\n\nThe objection  focuses on  the district  court's opening  comment\n\n                                52\n\nthat \"[f]ederal  trial judges are  forbidden to instruct  on jury\n\nnullification,\"  interpreting  this  as  a  judicial  prohibition\n\nagainst  the jury's  use of  its inherent  power.   The objection\n\nfails for  several reasons,  most noticeably  because the  quoted\n\nstatement conveys no such chilling effect.\n\n          Taken  literally, the  judge's  comment is  an accurate\n\nrecitation of the law and  an appropriate rejoinder to the jury's\n\nquestion on  nullification (a question that appellants prompted).\n\nThe district court  explained why it could not  answer the jury's\n\nrequest for more information on nullification.  The court went on\n\nto  repeat its earlier instruction that  if the government proved\n\nits  case  the jury  \"should\"  convict, while  if  the government\n\nfailed to carry its burden the jury \"must\" acquit.  This contrast\n\nin directives, together with  the court's refusal to instruct  in\n\nany  detail  about  the  doctrine  of  jury  nullification,  left\n\npregnant the possibility that the jury could ignore the law if it\n\nso chose.  Whether the jury perceived this possibility or not, no\n\nerror infiltrated the court's supplemental instruction.\n\nIX.  VARIANCE BETWEEN INDICTMENT AND PROOF\n\n          Appellants Edgar Sepulveda and Tony Rood now claim that\n\nthe  district court should have  acquitted them because they were\n\nnot part  of the charged  conspiracy.  We review  their claims to\n\ndetermine whether  there is  sufficient evidence  to support  the\n\njury's verdict.  See David, 940 F.2d at 732.  We conclude that  a\n                          \n\nrational  jury  could find,  as  this  jury  did, that  a  single\n\nconspiracy  existed, and that  the two objectors  participated in\n\n                                53\n\nit.\n\n          We start with bedrock.  Ordinarily, questions anent the\n\nnumber  and structure  of conspiracies  present  matters of  fact\n\nsuitable for  resolution by  a jury.

Similarly, the modus operandi of  a\n                                                           \n\nconspiracy may vary over time without negating the existence of a\n\nsingle conspiracy.  See Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 223.\n                                   \n\n          Turning to the instant case,  several defendants argued\n\nthat  they were  not  members  of the  charged  conspiracy.   The\n\ndistrict  court instructed  the  jury that  it  should convict  a\n\nparticular defendant only  if it found him  or her to be  part of\n\nthe  single  conspiracy  limned  in the  indictment.    The court\n\ncautioned the  jurors that  they must  acquit  any defendant  not\n\nlinked  to  that  conspiracy even  if  they  concluded that  such\n\ndefendant  had  been a  member  of  a  separate, equally  heinous\n\nconspiracy.  The  verdict, then, had the effect  of rejecting the\n\n                                54\n\n\"multiple  conspiracy\"  defense,  instead signifying  the  jury's\n\ncontrary conclusion that the appellants collogued together within\n\nthe framework of the master conspiracy.\n\n          To  be sure,  the  charged  conspiracy  had  a  protean\n\nquality    but  many criminal  conspiracies,  particularly  large\n\nconspiracies that  function for  extended periods  of time,  must\n\nadjust  to  cope with  changing  conditions.    In this  respect,\n\nconspiracies are like other business organizations:  a conspiracy\n\nmay  hire,  fire,  retool, change  suppliers,  expand,  downsize,\n\nrefine   its  operating   practices,   undertake  new   marketing\n\nstrategies, or  shift its priorities  from time  to time  without\n\nsacrificing its essential  identity.  It is, therefore, not fatal\n\nto  the  government's  \"single  conspiracy\"  theory  that   David\n\nSepulveda began his career  by patronizing a cocaine supplier  in\n\nNashua, and  later switched to  a source in Lawrence.   Likewise,\n\nthe fact that the organization's methods and tactics evolved over\n\ntime did not dictate  a finding of  two, three, or four  separate\n\nconspiracies.    The government  offered  evidence  showing that,\n\nthroughout the  six-year period  covered by  the indictment,  the\n\ngoals  of the organization were constant,  its leadership did not\n\nchange, and  much of its  membership remained stable.   These are\n\nimportant indicia  of unitariness.   See David, 940 F.2d  at 734.\n                                              \n\nAll in all,  we find the common threads adequate to create a jury\n\nquestion as to whether a single conspiracy existed.\n\n          The  evidence  tying  Edgar  Sepulveda  to  the  single\n\nconspiracy  is more  than ample.   Two  witnesses testified  that\n\n                                55\n\nEdgar, himself, sold them cocaine.  Four witnesses testified that\n\nEdgar routinely  accompanied his  brother, David,  on drug-buying\n\nsprees.   One of  these witnesses,  Norberto Perez, testified  to\n\ntaking  an average  of one  such trip  a week with  the Sepulveda\n\nsiblings over a protracted period of time.  Another witness, John\n\nRice, testified that he  saw the Sepulvedas packaging  cocaine at\n\nDriesse's home.\n\n          There is  similar, albeit  less pervasive, evidence  of\n\nRood's role  in the  organization.  Perez  testified that  he and\n\nRood made  over fifteen trips  to Lawrence in order  to replenish\n\nDavid  Sepulveda's drug  inventory.   When  David  agreed to  pay\n\nSantos in  kind for chauffeuring  him during a drug  delivery, he\n\ninstructed  Rood,  in  Santos's  presence,  to  give  Santos  his\n\nstipend.   On  another occasion,  David  sent Rood  and Perez  to\n\nretrieve cocaine that had  been abandoned during a  police chase.\n\nFinally,  a gaggle of witnesses, including Santos, testified that\n\nthey had purchased cocaine from Rood.  From this variegated proof\n\nthe jury could permissibly weave a tapestry linking Rood with the\n\nmaster conspiracy rather  than isolating him within  the cloister\n\nof the self-styled \"mini-conspiracy\" in which he now professes to\n\nhave been involved.  See Moran, 984 F.2d at 1304; Glenn, 828 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 861-62.\n\n          To recapitulate,  the record satisfactorily  supports a\n\nmultifaceted  finding that the  single conspiracy charged  in the\n\nindictment  existed and that  both Edgar Sepulveda  and Tony Rood\n\nenlisted  in it.   Thus,  no  material variance  existed and  the\n\n                                56\n\ndistrict court properly refused to order acquittal.\n\nX.  POTPOURRI\n\n          Appellants raise a  number of other issues.   Believing\n\nthat  exegetic treatment of  these points  would serve  no useful\n\npurpose, we  reject some  by means of  this global  reference and\n\ndiscuss the rest in summary fashion.\n\n               A.  Particularity of the Indictment.\n                                                  \n\n          Two  appellants  challenge  the  particularity  of  the\n\nindictment as it applies to them.  While we comment separately on\n\neach  challenge, we  first lay  out  the black-letter  rule:   in\n\ngeneral,  an  indictment   is  sufficiently   particular  if   it\n\nelucidates  the elements of the  crime, enlightens a defendant as\n\nto the  nature of the charge  against which she must  defend, and\n\nenables  her   to  plead  double   jeopardy  in  bar   of  future\n\nprosecutions for the same offense.  See Hamling v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109084\"><a href=\"/opinion/109084/hamling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  117 (1974)  (collecting cases);  see also  Fed.

Arline Welch.\n                          \n\nas it  applies to  her, the  indictment transgresses  the Hamling\n                                                                 \n\nguidelines.  The gravamen of her complaint is that the indictment\n\nneither contains the elements of  the crime charged nor limns the\n\ndate, time,  and place of  her ostensible criminal activity.   We\n\nthink  her reading  of the  charging papers  is colored  by self-\n\ninterest.\n\n          The grand jury indicted Welch for conspiracy to possess\n\nand distribute  cocaine in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     846.   To\n\n                                57\n\nconvict  her, therefore,  the  government had  to  show beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt that a drug-trafficking conspiracy existed about\n\nwhich Welch knew and in  which she voluntarily participated.  See\n                                                                 \n\nDavid, 940 F.2d at 735 (explaining elements of conspiracy under  \n     \n\n846);  Gomez-Pabon, 911  F.2d at  852 (similar).   The indictment\n                  \n\nspecifies the  law which  Welch is alleged  to have  violated and\n\nelaborates that she, with others, \"knowingly\" and \"intentionally\"\n\nagreed to act in contravention of that law.   The indictment also\n\nprovides a temporal framework, asserts that Welch's residence was\n\nused as  a packaging center  for the drug distribution  ring, and\n\nstates that she worked as a \"runner\" and a \"street-level dealer.\"\n\nWe think  this information  sufficiently spelled  out the  crime,\n\napprised Welch of the charge against which she had to defend, and\n\nprotected her from the boggart  of double jeopardy.  See Hamling,\n                                                                \n\n418 U.S. at 117;  Paiva, 892 F.2d at 154.  In  the last analysis,\n                       \n\nindictments need not be infinitely specific.\n\n          2.   Kevin Cullinane.   Defendant Kevin  Cullinane also\n          2.   Kevin Cullinane.\n                              \n\nchallenges the indictment's  particularity.  Notwithstanding  the\n\npervasive proof of his complicitous conduct adduced at trial, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Part II(B), Cullinane points out that the indictment itself\n     \n\nonly mentions him twice, asserting that he purchased cocaine from\n\nDavid   Sepulveda  and  that,   on  one  specific   occasion,  he\n\ndistributed  cocaine to another coconspirator.  But the frequency\n\nwith which a person is (or is  not) mentioned in an indictment is\n\nan  insufficient  indicium  of  the  indictment's  particularity.\n\nHere,  the  charging  papers  contained  considerable  contextual\n\n                                58\n\ndetail.   Given  the  indictment's  general  description  of  the\n\nconspiracy and  identification of the alleged  coconspirators, we\n\nfind  that  it   put  Cullinane  on  fair  notice  and  contained\n\ninformation sufficient to allow him  to prepare his defense.

For our part, we\n\nhave  been  unable  to  discover  any  such  instance.    In  the\n\nunremarkable circumstances of this case, the district court acted\n\nwell  within  the   encincture  of  its  discretion   in  denying\n\nappellants' motions.\n\n                        C.  Speedy Trial.\n                                        \n\n          Arline Welch  contends that  the court  below erred  in\n\nrefusing to  dismiss the charges  against her on the  ground that\n\ntoo long  a time  intervened between indictment  and trial.   Her\n\nclaim invokes  the  Speedy  Trial Act,  18  U.S.C.      3161-3174\n\n(1988).  The Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n               In  any  case  in which  a  plea  of not\n          guilty is entered,  the trial of a  defendant\n          charged in  an . .  . indictment . .  . shall\n          commence within seventy days from the  filing\n          date . . .  of the . . . indictment,  or from\n          the date the defendant has appeared before  a\n          judicial officer  . . ., whichever  date last\n          occurs.\n\n18 U.S.C.   3161(c)(1).\n\n          For   Speedy  Trial   Act  purposes,   time  has   both\n\nquantitative  and qualitative dimensions.  The Act's 70-day trial\n\nmandate,  see id.,  exemplifies its  quantitative side.   On  the\n                 \n\nqualitative  side,  the  Act  excludes  from  the  70-day  period\n\nintervals of delay  that result from such events  as the pendency\n\nof pretrial motions, see 18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F),  the presence\n                        \n\nof other defendants  in the case \"as  to whom the time  for trial\n\nhas not run and no motion for severance has been granted,\" id. at\n                                                              \n\n                                60\n\n  3161(h)(7), or continuances which  serve the \"ends of justice,\"\n\nid. at   3161(h)(8)(A).  Therefore, a violation of the Act occurs\n   \n\nonly if (i) a sufficient  number of days elapse (the quantitative\n\nbenchmark),  and (ii) the days are nonexcludable (the qualitative\n\nbenchmark).\n\n          Against this background, the chronology of Welch's case\n\nis telling.  Her arraignment took place on November 19, 1990, and\n\nher trial started on April 2, 1991.  Quantitatively, this 134-day\n\ninterval  exceeds the  goal set  by the Speedy  Trial Act.   But,\n\nqualitatively,  the  record  presents   a  much  more  excusatory\n\npicture.   The bulk of  the time elapsed between  arraignment and\n\ntrial  is  excludable  for  Speedy  Trial  Act  purposes  because\n\npretrial motions filed by the defendants, as  a group, engendered\n\nconsiderable delay (bringing the nonexcludable time to fewer than\n\n35 days).   Hence, the court  below did not  err in declining  to\n\ndismiss  the case  under  the  Speedy Trial  Act.25   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States  v.

We discern  no such problem  here.   Ranfros's testimony\n\ncould  be taken  to  bear  on guilty  knowledge,  and, thus,  the\n\ndistrict court had discretion to allow the jury to consider it.\n\n                       F.  The Terry Stop.\n                                         \n\n          At trial, the government  introduced evidence that  the\n\npolice  seized $4,200 from  David Sepulveda after  a highway stop\n\nnear  Nashua.   Sepulveda moved  to suppress  the evidence.   The\n\ngovernment contended that  the cash constituted  the fruits of  a\n\nsearch incident  to a lawful  arrest.  The district  court denied\n\nthe  suppression motion without comment.  Sepulveda assigns error\n\nto this  ruling and to  the admission of evidence  emanating from\n\nthe seizure.\n\n          In  its appellate  brief, the  government concedes  the\n\nfallibility of the construct that it hawked in the district court\n\nand, instead, attempts to justify the search under Terry v.

We  do not\n\nfind  it surprising  that  the  prosecution,  like  a  Pirandello\n\ncharacter in  search of  an author,  has encountered  insuperable\n\ndifficulties in articulating a viable theory:  the short of it is\n\nthat the cash  was unlawfully  seized and  that evidence  derived\n\nfrom  the  seizure  should  have  been suppressed.    We  do  not\n\nunderstand why  the government is  unwilling simply to  face that\n\nfact    or why it pressed so vigorously to have evidence obtained\n\nin a patently illegal manner admitted in the first place.\n\n          At  any rate,  the matter  is academic.

In testimony not covered  by the motion\n\nto suppress, a civilian witness, Michael Lacerte, related that he\n\nhad given  the funds in  question to Sepulveda so  that Sepulveda\n\ncould   buy  cocaine.     Lacerte   also  recounted   Sepulveda's\n\nexplanation as to seizure of the money.  Under the circumstances,\n\nand bearing in mind the factors that frame our inquiry, see supra\n                                                                 \n\npp. 30,  whatever error inhered  in admitting evidence  anent the\n\n                                64\n\nseizure and its sequelae was entirely harmless.\n\n                         G.  Jury Taint.\n                                       \n\n          At one point during the  trial, a juror joked about one\n\nof the defendants.  The  district court proceeded to question two\n\njurors  out of  earshot of  the  venire.   After identifying  the\n\nindividual  responsible for  the  wisecrack, the  court dismissed\n\nher.   Appellants  moved unsuccessfully  for  a mistrial  and now\n\nposit error based on the denial of their motion.\n\n          We  find  nothing  amiss.   When  a  potentially taint-\n\nproducing  event threatens  to  mar  the  jury's  integrity,  the\n\ndistrict  court has fairly  broad discretion in  deciding whether\n\nthe  situation is  susceptible to  remediation, and  if  so, what\n\ncorrective action might be appropriate.   See Boylan, 898 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n258; Gutierrez-Rodriguez  v.

Unless the event leaves  so sour a taste  that less\n\nextreme palliatives will prove inadequate to undo serious damage,\n\nthe  mere  possibility  of  jury taint  does  not  necessitate  a\n\nmistrial.

Mindful of the trial  court's superior coign of\n\nvantage, we  accord great respect  to a district  judge's finding\n\nthat a  jury has not been  irreparably tainted.  See  Boylan, 898\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 258.\n\n          Here,   the    judge   employed   a    combination   of\n\namelioratives:  he removed the  offending juror from the case and\n\nissued hortatory  instructions to  the remaining  jurors.   Given\n\nwhat  transpired, the judge's  prescription seems reasonably well\n\n                                65\n\ncalculated  to  protect  the defendants'  legitimate  rights; the\n\njoke,  albeit tasteless,  did not  work a  per se  deprivation of\n                                                 \n\nappellants' right to a fair trial.  Consequently, the court acted\n\nappropriately in refusing to abort the trial.  See Hunnewell, 891\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 961.\n\n                   H.

After  examining the\n\nrecords, the  government returned them to  Cullinane's housemate.\n\nIn  turn,  the  housemate  threw  them  out.    Seizing  on  this\n\ndevelopment,  appellant  Arline  Welch   asseverates  that  those\n\nrecords  may have  contained  exculpatory material  vis-a-vis her\n\nrelationship with Cullinane and that, therefore, the government's\n\nfailure  to maintain them  requires dismissal of  the indictment.\n\nThe asseveration is full of holes.\n\n          Government  destruction   of  potentially   exculpatory\n\nevidence only violates the rule in Brady,  373 U.S. at 87, if the\n                                        \n\nevidence  possesses apparent exculpatory  value that cannot fully\n\nbe  replicated through other sources, and  if the government acts\n\nwillfully or in bad faith in failing to preserve it.

Six appellants (Rood, Wallace, Cullinane,\n\nArline  Welch,  Edward  Welch,  and  Johnson)  challenge  rulings\n\nrelative to  the imposition  of sentence.28   To the  extent that\n\nthese challenges touch  upon the district court's  factfinding or\n\nits evaluative judgments in applying the guidelines to the  facts\n\nas found, appellate review is for clear error.

The   drug  quantity\n\nattributable  to  a  particular defendant  is  derived  by adding\n\ntogether the amounts of narcotics, actual or negotiated, bound up\n\nin the acts  \"that were  part of  the same course  of conduct  or\n\ncommon scheme  or plan as  the offense of conviction.\"   U.S.S.G.\n\n 1B1.3(a)(2).   However,  in the  context  of jointly  undertaken\n\ncriminal  activity,  such as  a  conspiracy, a  defendant  is not\n\nautomatically  saddled with the  full weight of  the conspiracy's\n\nwrongdoing;  rather,  a  defendant is  responsible  for  drugs he\n\npersonally  handled  or  anticipated  handling,  and,  under  the\n\nrelevant  conduct rubric, for  drugs involved in  additional acts\n\nthat  were reasonably  foreseeable by  him and were  committed in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy.   See  Garcia, 954  F.2d at  15;\n                                              \n\nDavid,  940 F.2d at 742; see also U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(1), comment.\n                                 \n\n(n.1).

Tony Rood; William Wallace.\n                                               \n\n          Appellants  Rood and  Wallace  object to  the  district\n\ncourt's  attribution  of  particular  drug  quantities  to  them.\n\nBecause the same type of error infects both sentences, we discuss\n\nthem in the ensemble.\n\n          In regard  to Rood  and Wallace,  the district  court's\n\ndrug quantity calculations  rested essentially  on Perez's  trial\n\ntestimony.29    According  to  Perez,  Rood  accompanied  him  on\n\nfifteen  to twenty drug-buying jaunts and Wallace accompanied him\n\non ten to  fifteen such trips.   Perez did not  assign particular\n\namounts to particular  people on  particular trips.   Rather,  he\n\ntestified  in sweeping  generalities, stating  that the  smallest\n\namount he  remembered having been  acquired, in the eighty  or so\n\ntrips he took with Sepulveda and an assortment of companions over\n\na two-year period (1987-1989), was four ounces (113.4 grams), and\n\nthe largest amount acquired was one kilogram (an amount purchased\n\nmore  than once).   In  preparing  the presentence  investigation\n\nreport  (PSI Report), the probation department adopted methods of\n\ncalculation  apparently  urged  by the  prosecution.    The basic\n\n                    \n\n     29To  be sure, there  was some evidence  of participation by\nRood and-or Wallace in a few other incidents.  But the quantities\ninvolved in  these incidents were  niggling in comparison  to the\nSepulveda trips and, thus, do not affect these appeals.\n\n                                71\n\nmethod  was to  construct a  double \"average\"  covering both  the\n\nnumber of runs  and the amount of cocaine carried.  This was done\n\nby  taking  the  midpoint  of   the  high  and  low  figures  and\n\nmultiplying the  average  number of  runs by  the average  amount\n\ncarried.  Thus, in Wallace's  case, the PSI Report assumed twelve\n\nruns (an alleged \"average\" of ten and fifteen) and 556 grams  per\n\nrun  (the rounded-off average, expressed in grams, of four ounces\n\nand  one kilogram),  attributing  a total  of  6.68 kilograms  of\n\ncocaine to  him.  In  Rood's case, a different  probation officer\n\nproposed  a  slightly   more  complicated  (but  methodologically\n\nsimilar) calculation  and attributed 8.3  kilograms to him.   The\n\nexact  mechanics  are beside  the  point; what  matters,  for our\n\npurposes,  is  that,  albeit  somewhat  more  circuitously,   the\n\nultimate attribution  of a  drug quantity figure  to Rood,  as to\n\nWallace,  represented   an  assumed   average  number  of   trips\n\nmultiplied by an assumed average quantity of cocaine per trip.\n\n          The district  court held  separate sentencing  hearings\n\nfor Rood and Wallace.  Neither the prosecution nor the defendants\n\noffered additional evidence.  The court, over objection, endorsed\n\nthe probation  officers' calculations, attributing  8.3 kilograms\n\nof cocaine to Rood and 7.6 kilograms  to Wallace.  This yielded a\n\nbase  offense level  (BOL)  of 32  for  each man.   See  U.S.S.G.\n                                                       \n\n 2D1.1(c) (6) (Drug Quantity  Table) (establishing BOL of 32  for\n\nat least five  but less than fifteen kilograms of  cocaine).  The\n\ncourt  essayed  further  offense-level  adjustments (not  now  in\n\ndispute), factored Rood's criminal history category (IV) into the\n\n                                72\n\nmix,  and set  his guideline  sentencing range  (GSR) at  135-168\n\nmonths.   The court sentenced  Rood at  the bottom of  the range.\n\nWallace  displayed a  less notorious  criminal history  (category\n\nII).  Nonetheless,  after interim adjustments not  material here,\n\nhis GSR proved  to be  identical.   Relying on  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nFloyd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569172\"><a href=\"/opinion/569172/united-states-v-dion-floyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099 (9th Cir.  1991), and citing a lack of\n     \n\nadult   guidance  during  Wallace's  youth,  the  court  departed\n\ndownward, sentencing him to ten years.30\n\n          The defense's first line of attack is to assail Perez's\n\ntestimony as utterly unreliable in view of his dubious character,\n\nasserted  contradictions, and  sundry other  defects.   But,  the\n\ntrial judge  heard and saw  Perez testify at trial,  and credited\n\nhis testimony.   Such credibility  calls are grist for  the trial\n\ncourt's mill.   See St. Cyr, 977  F.2d at 706.

The\n\ncritical problem  with respect to  these sentences lies  not with\n\nPerez's testimony  but with  the pyramiding  of inferences  based\n\nupon it.

Similarly,  while the\n\ndistortions are mathematically  less serious, the selection  of a\n\nmidpoint in  estimating  the  number of  trips  is  also  without\n\nevidentiary support.

Here,  however, the  record  does not  justify  the\n\ndistrict  court's findings  concerning  the  drug  quantities  it\n\nattributed  to Rood  and  Wallace.    Accordingly,  because  drug\n\nquantity dictated these  appellants' offense levels and  at least\n\narguably  influenced  their  sentences,  Rood   and  Wallace  are\n\nentitled to be resentenced.31 \n\n                       C.  Kevin Cullinane.\n                                          \n\n          After all relevant adjustments had been made, the court\n\nbelow established a GSR of 121-151  months referable to appellant\n\nCullinane,32  and  sentenced him  at  the  range's  nadir.   This\n\ndetermination  rested in  substantial part  on  the court's  drug\n\n                    \n\n     31On remand, the district court  is, of course, free to hear\nnew evidence bearing on drug quantity.  For example, it  may well\nbe that better evidence  can be adduced by recalling  Perez or by\ncalling other witnesses.   Alternatively, the government  has the\n\"low point\" estimates as to both  the number of trips and amounts\ntransported to fall back upon   and it has some specific evidence\nas to other transactions.  To start a mini-trial on drug quantity\nis surely a  discouraging supplement to a lengthy  trial; but too\nmuch rides  on the  computations to  rely upon the  kind of  drug\nquantity calculations  that the  government urges  in respect  to\nthese two appellants.\n\n     32We  do not  dissect the  interim  adjustments made  by the\ndistrict court en route to  the GSR as Cullinane concentrates his\nfire on the  drug quantity finding.  We follow this same pattern,\nwhenever applicable, in discussing other appellants' sentences.\n\n                                77\n\nquantity  assessment.    Cullinane  challenges  this  assessment,\n\ninsisting that Judge Devine erred in ascribing 8.99  kilograms of\n\ncocaine to him.\n\n          Our   review   of   Cullinane's   challenge   is   more\n\ncircumscribed  than  might  appear   at  first  blush.    It   is\n\nunnecessary  to   address  an   allegedly  erroneous   sentencing\n\ncomputation if,  and to the  extent that, correcting it  will not\n\nchange  the applicable offense  level or otherwise  influence the\n\ndefendant's  GSR (and,  ultimately, his  sentence).

This\n\nprinciple is pertinent in Cullinane's  case:  his BOL, and, thus,\n\nhis sentence, will remain unchanged  so long as he is responsible\n\nfor an amount of cocaine between five and fifteen kilograms.  See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug  Quantity Table).

Although  the district\n\ncourt  relied  on the  testimony  of  a  number of  witnesses  to\n\nbuttress the  drug quantity it  attributed to Cullinane,  we need\n\nnot go beyond the testimony of David Chase.  Chase stated that he\n\nbought somewhere between five and eight kilograms of cocaine from\n\nCullinane.

Even if\n\nChase's  testimony is reliable,  he ruminates, the  conduct Chase\n\ndescribes is irrelevant to the charged conspiracy.  This maneuver\n\ntakes  appellant  down  a  blind alley.    Within  broad  limits,\n\nreviewing courts must defer to a sentencing judge's determination\n\nof  relevant  conduct.

Full\n\ndeference is  due and  Chase's testimony, though  circumstantial,\n\ntouched upon,  and could logically  be found to  involve, matters\n\ncoming  within  the scope  of the  conspiracy.   Accordingly, the\n\nlower court  did  not  commit  clear  error  in  concluding  that\n\nCullinane's transactions  with Chase  comprised relevant  conduct\n\n                                79\n\nfor sentencing purposes.\n\n                        D.  Arline Welch.\n                                        \n\n          The  district court attributed 1924 grams of cocaine to\n\nArline  Welch  and imposed  the  mandatory  minimum incarcerative\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B), viz., five years.  Welch\n                                             \n\ncontests  only the  district  court's drug  quantity  assessment.\n\nBecause  the mandatory minimum  applies so long  as quantities of\n\ncocaine totalling 500  grams or more are involved  in the offense\n\nof conviction,  see id., we  need only inquire whether  that much\n                       \n\ncontraband can fairly be attributed to her.\n\n          We answer this  query affirmatively.   Perez  testified\n\nthat  Arline Welch accompanied him  on three journeys to Lawrence\n\nand that 10  ounces of cocaine were  acquired on each trip.   The\n\ndistrict court credited Perez's testimony, attributing nearly 900\n\ngrams of  cocaine to  Arline Welch on  this account.   We decline\n\nappellant's invitation to second-guess this finding. \n\n                        E.  Edward Welch.\n                                        \n\n          The district court attributed 7.72 kilograms of cocaine\n\nto Edward Welch and, after various interim adjustments, sentenced\n\nhim to  135 months  in prison (the  low end  of the GSR).   Welch\n\nchallenges only the drug quantity assessment.\n\n          The  court's  attribution  of cocaine  to  Edward Welch\n\nrests upon a cornucopia of  testimony.  It would serve  no useful\n\npurpose to survey it all.  Upon  careful review of the record, we\n\ncan see, at a minimum, no clear error in the court's  decision to\n\naccept the testimony  of Coriaty and Milne    testimony that was,\n\n                                80\n\nin  itself, sufficient  to support  the attribution  of over  5.3\n\nkilograms to  this defendant.33   At this  point, Welch's  ground\n\nof appeal collapses,  for his sentence  would be the same  if the\n\ncourt had  found 5.3 kilograms  rather than 7.72 kilograms.   See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Table).\n\n                       F.  Cheryl Johnson.\n                                         \n\n          The  lower court attributed 1.2 kilograms of cocaine to\n\nCheryl  Johnson  and  imposed  the  mandatory  minimum  five-year\n\nsentence.   See 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  Johnson  disputes the\n               \n\ndrug quantity  finding.  Here,  again, the trigger amount  is 500\n\ngrams of cocaine.  See id.\n                          \n\n          The district court determined, inter alia, that Johnson\n                                                   \n\nsold 1/16th  of an  ounce of cocaine  to Santos  on at  least 100\n\noccasions; and that she sold 3/10s of an ounce to  officer Malone\n\non another occasion.  The  court further found that $7,115 seized\n\nfrom  Johnson's house constituted the proceeds of drug sales and,\n\nfor sentencing purposes, equated this cash stash with 5.08 ounces\n\nof cocaine.   Finally, the court credited  Perez's testimony that\n\nJohnson  participated in  at  least  \"a  couple\"  of  drug-buying\n\nexpeditions.   Erring  on the  side of  caution, the  court could\n\nwarrantably   have  found  Johnson  responsible  for  two  trips,\n\n                    \n\n     33At the  risk of carrying  coal to Newcastle, we  note that\nEdward Welch  was a  fellow traveller on,  and a  co-venturer in,\nseveral  drug-buying  expeditions  described  supra  Part  XI(D).\n                                                   \nThus, the drug  quantities associated with those  jaunts are also\nattributable to him.\n\n                                81\n\ninvolving  four  ounces  per  trip.34    In  the  aggregate,  the\n\ndeterminations  listed above support the attribution of 556 grams\n\nof  cocaine  to Johnson     more  than  the minimum  required  to\n\nunderbrace the sentence she received.\n\n          Johnson  argues against these  serial findings on three\n\ngrounds.  Her first attack   a broadside blast aimed at the total\n\nquantity  of cocaine attributed to her   deserves little comment.\n\nWe simply restate the obvious:   the district court's credibility\n\ncalls  are  beyond  reproach   and,  therefore,  its  bottom-line\n\nconclusion is not clearly erroneous.\n\n          Johnson's  second  fusillade  is  aimed   at  the  cash\n\nequivalency finding.  In drawing a head on the sentencing court's\n\ndecision to  translate dollars  into drugs,  Johnson is  shooting\n\nblanks.   The government presented abundant evidence of Johnson's\n\nnarcotics trafficking, see  supra Part II(D),  and the volume  of\n                                 \n\nbusiness  transacted justified the court's illation that the sums\n\nseized  were  connected  to  her  drug  dealings.    When  it  is\n\nreasonably probable that confiscated cash  represents either drug\n\nprofits   or  money  dedicated   to  the  upcoming   purchase  of\n\ncontraband,   a  sentencing  court  may  convert  the  cash  into\n\nequivalent  amounts of narcotics for \"relevant conduct\" purposes.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   2D1.4, comment. (n.2) (authorizing district courts\n   \n\nto use price as a means of approximating drug quantity); see also\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     34The court actually found that Johnson's two trips involved\n16 ounces per trip.   But, this finding utilized an impermissible\nprocess of rote averaging.  See supra  Part XI(B).  Hence, we use\n                                     \nthe low end of the range  of available estimates for purposes  of\nappellate review.\n\n                                82\n\nUnited States v.

So it is here.\n\n          Johnson's  third salvo also  flies wide of  the target.\n\nShe insists that the cash did not belong to her and, thus, cannot\n\nfigure  in  her  sentence.   But  as  we  read  the  record,  the\n\ncircumstantial  evidence   supports  a  finding   of  proprietary\n\ninterest.   And, moreover, even  if we were  to give credence  to\n\nJohnson's  protest  regarding  ownership,  the  cash  equivalency\n\nevidence could  be used against  her as  long as  the drug  money\n\nconstituted part  of the same common  scheme or plan  and met the\n\nforeseeability  requirement   for  relevant  conduct   under  the\n\nguidelines.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15; Blanco, 888 F.2d at 910-\n                                               \n\n11; see also  supra Part  XI(A) (discussing  relevant conduct  in\n                   \n\nconspiracy  cases).    The  evidence  here  could  reasonably  be\n\ninterpreted as  placing the  cash stash within  the orbit  of the\n\nconspiracy.   For these reasons, we detect  no clear error in the\n\nlower  court's conclusion  that the  money ought  properly to  be\n\ntreated  as  a  proxy  for  cocaine  and  counted   against  this\n\nappellant.\n\n          Johnson  has two  final  items  in  her  asseverational\n\narray.  She asserts that the court should have reduced her BOL by\n\ntwo levels since  she was merely a minor participant  in the drug\n\ndistribution scheme, see  U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b), and that  the court\n                        \n\nshould  have departed downward  due to her  family circumstances.\n\n                                83\n\nNeither assertion has much firepower.\n\n          As  to   the  former   plaint,  a   role-in-the-offense\n\nreduction,  even if granted, would  have no effect on appellant's\n\nsentence  due to the  overriding force  of the  mandatory minimum\n\nprescribed by 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  See U.S.S.G.   5G1.1(b)\n                                             \n\n(providing that  the statutorily required  minimum sentence shall\n\nbe  the  guideline  sentence  when  it exceeds  the  top  of  the\n\napplicable GSR).  The assignment of error is, therefore, moot.\n\n          As  to  Johnson's last  point,  it is  settled  in this\n\ncircuit  that a  sentencing  judge's  informed  decision  not  to\n\ndepart, regardless of direction, is a non-appealable event.

CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go  no  further.   After  considering all  the\n\nissues   raised  by   appellants,  including   some  issues   not\n\nspecifically  discussed herein, we  have unearthed no  vestige of\n\nreversible error.    Appellants' convictions  and  sentences  are\n\n                                84\n\ntherefore lawful, save only for the sentences imposed on Rood and\n\nWallace.   Accordingly, we affirm  the convictions  of those  two\n\nappellants, vacate their sentences,  and remand for resentencing.\n\nAt the same  time, we affirm the convictions and sentences of the\n\nother eight appellants.   We stay issuance of mandate in  all the\n\nappeals, pending publication  of the two additional  (and closely\n\nrelated) opinions described supra note 2.\n                                 \n\n          The  convictions  and  sentences  of  appellants  David\n                                                                 \n\nSepulveda,  Edgar  Sepulveda,  Edward W.  Welch,  Jr.,  Arline S.\n                                                                 \n\nWelch, Kevin Cullinane, Cheryl T. Johnson, Richard F.

The convictions\n                                                                 \n\nof appellants  Tony  Rood and  William D.  Wallace are  affirmed,\n                                                                 \n\ntheir sentences  are vacated, and,  as to those  appellants only,\n                                                                 \n\nthe case is  remanded for resentencing.
