Appellant Luz  Aida  Rodriguez appeals  a\n                \n\nmemorandum order by the United  States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto  Rico denying her  motion for relief  from\n\njudgment pursuant  to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 60(b)(4)  &amp; (6).   The\n\ngravamen of  appellant's argument  is that  the judgment  was\n\nvoid  because the court lacked jurisdiction due to inadequate\n\nservice of process.  We affirm.\n\n                          Background\n\n     In 1971, the  Farmers Home Administration [FHA]  granted\n\nappellant and her  then husband a mortgage loan  secured by a\n\nlien  over appellant's  property  in Can vanas,  Puerto Rico.\n\nAppellant  assumed the entire obligation after being divorced\n\nfrom her husband in 1972.  In September 1991, after appellant\n\nhad fallen  behind in  the installment  payments, the  United\n\nStates,  on behalf  of the  FHA, filed  a judicial  action in\n\nfederal   district   court  for   collection  of   money  and\n\nforeclosure of the mortgage.  On September 24, 1991, a United\n\nStates Deputy  Marshall personally  delivered to  appellant's\n\nresidence a  copy of  the summons and  the complaint  in this\n\ncase.   The Deputy  Marshall testified  that the  papers were\n\naccepted by appellant's son.  \n\n     Appellant  failed to appear  and a default  judgment was\n\nentered  on November  15, 1991.   An  order for  execution of\n\njudgment  was entered  on February  13, 1992,  and a  writ of\n\nexecution on February 24.  A notice of  sale was published on\n\n                             -2-\n\nApril 10, 1992, and a public sale  was held on June 10.   The\n\nproperty was awarded  to the highest bidder and  the sale was\n\nconfirmed by the district court on September 9, 1992.\n\n     On September 20,  1992, appellant moved in  the district\n\ncourt  for  the case  to  be  dismissed  for lack  of  proper\n\nservice.   According  to affidavits  filed  with the  motion,\n\nappellant attested that  she had not been served  with a copy\n\nof the  complaint and that she  had lived alone for  the past\n\nfour years.  Her son further attested that he had  never been\n\nserved with  a copy  of the summons  or complaint.   Hearings\n\nwere held in December 1992 and January 1993 at which oral and\n\ndocumentary  evidence was presented.  Based on this evidence,\n\nthe  court found  that  the Deputy  Marshall  had served  the\n\nappellant, through her son, at the appellant's dwelling place\n\nin accord with Fed. R. Civ. P.  4(d)(1).  The court found the\n\ncontrary attestations  of  appellant and  her son  to be  not\n\ncredible.  As a consequence,  the court denied the motion for\n\nrelief from judgment.\n\n                          Discussion\n\n     Appellant  asserts that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\nfinding  that process  had been properly  served upon  her in\n\nthis case.  We review  the court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror.  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.  1992).  \"[W]hen factual findings are\n\nbased   on  determinations   regarding  the   credibility  of\n\n                             -3-\n\nwitnesses [Fed. R. Civ. P.]  52 demands that the appeal court\n\naccord even greater deference to the trial court's findings.\"\n\n Rodriguez-Morales v. Veterans Admin., 931 F.2d 980, 982 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1991) (citing  cases).   We  usually  review a  court's\n\ndenial  of  a  Rule  60(b)   motion  only  for  an  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  Cotto  v. United States, 993 F.2d  274, 277 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1993).    However, \"[a]  default judgment  entered by  a\n\ncourt  which  lacks  jurisdiction  over  the  person  of  the\n\ndefendant is void,\"   Precision Etchings &amp; Findings,  Inc. v.\n                                                         \n\nLGP Gem, Ltd., 953 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1992), and \"[i]f the\n            \n\njudgment is void, the district court has no discretion but to\n\nset aside the  entry of the  default judgment,\"   Echevarria-\n                                                             \n\nGonzales v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                           \n\n     Pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P.  4(d)(1) service of process\n\nmay be made \n\n     by leaving copies [of the summons and complaint] at\n\n     the  individual's dwelling house  or usual place of\n\n     abode  with   some  person  of   suitable  age  and\n\n     discretion then residing therein\n\nAt the  hearing on  the Rule 60  motion, the  Deputy Marshall\n\ntestified that he  had served a copy  of the summons  and the\n\ncomplaint  upon appellant's son at her dwelling.  Appellant's\n\nson  denied  having  been served.    Furthermore,  the Deputy\n\nMarshall  indicated that the person  whom he served seemed to\n\nbe about fifteen  or sixteen years old.   Appellant's son was\n\n                             -4-\n\nat  the time  twenty four.    The district  found appellant's\n\nson's denial  of having  been served not  credible.   It also\n\nfound that the discrepancy in ages was explicable by the fact\n\nthat appellant's son  looked younger than his age.   In light\n\nof  the  deference  owed  to  the  district  court in  making\n\ncredibility determinations,  we find  no clear  error in  the\n\ncourt's  finding  that  process  was  served  on the  son  at\n\nappellant's house.\n\n     Appellant also contends  that the son upon  whom process\n\nwas  allegedly served did not reside in appellant's house and\n\nthus  was  not  a  proper recipient  of  process  under  Rule\n\n4(d)(1).  The  only evidence of  appellant's son residing  at\n\nher  house was  the testimony  of the  Deputy Marshall.   His\n\ntestimony shows that the person whom he served at appellant's\n\ndwelling  identified himself as appellant's son and that from\n\nthis  the Deputy Marshall  assumed that he  resided therein.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  The following evidence was presented at the hearing:\n\n     Counsel:  How  do you know  [the person served]  was her\nson?\n\n     Marshall:  He told me he  was Mrs. Lu[z] Ida Rodriguez's\nson.\n\n     Counsel:  He told you.  Did he tell you he lived there?\n\n     Marshall: Yes, he did.\n\n     Counsel:  How did he say that?\n\n     Marshall: Well, I was looking for Mrs. Luz Ida Rodriguez\nat  that address  and the  boy happened  to be there,  and he\nsaid, \"Yes,  it is my mother.\"  That is  the way I served the\n\n                             -5-\n\nAppellant's  son, on the other hand, denied having resided at\n\nhis mother's  house when  process was  allegedly served.   He\n\ntestified that at the time in question he was living with his\n\nwife  and chidren at the  home of his  wife's parents.  While\n\nthe  district court  made  no specific  finding that  the son\n\nresided  in appellant's dwelling, such a finding was implicit\n\nin his decision.  See Home-Stake Production Co, C.A. v. Talon\n                                                             \n\nPetroleum, 907 F.2d 1012, 1017 (10th Cir. 1990).  \n         \n\n     Where, as  the court  supportably found  in the  instant\n\ncase,  a defendant has  received actual notice  of an action,\n\nservice   of  process   requirements   are  to   be  \"broadly\n\ninterpreted,\" see, e.g., Nowell v. Nowell, 384 F.2d 951  (5th\n                                         \n\nCir.  1967), cert.  denied,  390 U.S.  956  (1968); Adams  v.\n                                                         \n\nSchool   Board,  53  F.R.D.   267,  268  (D.Pa.   1971),  and\n              \n\n\"substantial compliance\" with the  requirements suffices, see\n                                                             \n\nPrecision Etchings, 953 F.2d at  24 (citing cases).  In cases\n                  \n\nwhere actual  notice has been  received, service on  a person\n\nlinked by a  \"substantial nexus\"  to the  defendant has  been\n\n                    \n\npaper, through him.\n\n     Counsel:  I  don't understand[.  T]he boy happened to be\nthere?  What does that mean?\n\n     Marshall: The boy was there.  In the house.\n\n     Counsel:  And how do you know the . . . boy lived in the\nhouse?\n\n     Marshall: Because   he  told  me   that  [he]  was  Mrs.\nRodriguez' son.  And that was at that address.\n\n                             -6-\n\nheld to meet  the requirements of Rule 4(d)(1).   See Nowell,\n                                                            \n\n384 F.2d at 953 (service  on defendant's landlady who resided\n\nin separate apartment building from defendant  found adequate\n\nwhere  \"substantial  nexus\"   existed  between  landlady  and\n\ndefendant); see  also M. Lowenstein  &amp; Sons, Inc.  v. Austin,\n                                                            \n\n430  F.Supp. 844,  845  (S.D.N.Y.  1977)  (daughter  who  was\n\nvisiting  home from  school and  stayed  overnight was  \"then\n\nresiding\" at residence for purposes of Rule 4(d)(1)).  In the\n\ninstant case, the  record supportably shows that  appellant's\n\nson answered  the door at her house when  she was not at home\n\nand  was therefore  a trusted  member of  the household.   In\n\nlight  of the \"substantial  nexus\" between appellant  and her\n\nson, we find  no clear error in the  court's implicit finding\n\nthat  appellant's son  was  \"residing\" in  her house  for the\n\npurposes  of Rule  4(d)(1).2   The court did  not err  in its\n\ndenial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.\n\n                    \n\n2.  A  similar  result was  reached by  the Supreme  Court of\nRhode Island in Plushner v.  Mills, 429 A.2d 444 (R.I. 1981).\n                                  \nIn  Plushner defendant's daughter was found to have \"resided\"\n            \nin defendant's household for purposes of receiving service of\nprocess even though she maintained a separate residence.  The\ncourt  found that she  was a  \"trusted member  of defendant's\nhousehold  and that a  substantial nexus existed  between her\nand defendant.\"   Id. at 446.  Although the court in Plushner\n                                                             \nwas  interpreting  the  Rhode  Island  rule  for  service  of\nprocess, that rule, in relevant part,  is almost identical to\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 4(d)(1)  and, in interpreting it,  the Rhode\nIsland courts  \"look for  guidance in the  precedents of  the\nfederal courts, upon  whose rules those of [Rhode Island] are\nclosely patterned.\"  Id. at 445 (quoting Nocera v. Lembo, 298\n                                                        \nA.2d 800, 803 (R.I. 1973)).\n\n                             -7-\n\n     Appellant  also   contends  that  the  court   erred  in\n\nreceiving and considering  evidence on issues other  than the\n\nadequacy  of the  service of  process  at the  hearing.   She\n\nfurther contends that  her right to due  process was violated\n\nby  the consideration  of  such evidence  since she  had been\n\nunable to conduct adequate discovery before the hearing.  \n\n     In  advance of the  hearing, the  court had  ordered the\n\ngovernment to  produce evidence of the \"amounts due and owing\n\nto  the  government  in this  case\"  and  had instructed  the\n\ndefendant   to   bring   in   evidence   setting  forth   her\n\nunderstanding of the amounts due.   The record indicates that\n\nthe court was aware that the issue of the amount owed was not\n\nbefore   the  court   but  considered   the   information  as\n\n\"background\" to  the Rule  60(b)(4) motion.   Moreover,  this\n\nbackground  evidence was relevant to the court's finding that\n\nappellant had actual notice of  the foreclosure action.3   We\n\nfind no abuse of  discretion in the court's consideration  of\n\nthis  \"background\"  evidence.     Furthermore,  even   though\n\nappellant had a limited time in which to prepare her response\n\nto the  government's evidence  of the amount  due, we  do not\n\nfind  that she suffered sufficient prejudice to implicate the\n\nfederal due process clause.\n\n                    \n\n3.  For  example,  the  government  presented  evidence  that\nappellant  attempted to  make a  partial  payment to  the FHA\neight days after  the summons was served and  that, when this\npayment  was returned, appellant  was personally  informed of\nthe existence of the proceedings against her.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     The denial  of  the motion  to  vacate the  judgment  is\n\naffirmed.\n        \n\n                             -9-\n",

Appellant's son denied having been served.  Furthermore, the Deputy Marshall indicated that the person whom he served seemed to be about fifteen or sixteen years old.  Appellant's son was at the time twenty four.  The district found appellant's son's denial of having been served not credible.  It also found that the discrepancy in ages was explicable by the fact that appellant's son looked younger than his age.  In light of the deference owed to the district court in making credibility determinations, we find no clear error in the court's finding that process was served on the son at appellant's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also contends that the son upon whom process was allegedly served did not reside in appellant's house and thus was not a proper recipient of process under Rule 4(d)(1).  The only evidence of appellant's son residing at her house was the testimony of the Deputy Marshall.  His testimony shows that the person whom he served at appellant's dwelling identified himself as appellant's son and that from this the Deputy Marshall assumed that he resided therein.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's son, on the other hand, denied having resided at his mother's house when process was allegedly served.  He testified that at the time in question he was living with his wife and children at the home of his wife's parents.  While the district court made no specific finding that the son resided in appellant's dwelling, such a finding was implicit in his decision.   See Home-Stake Production Co, C.A. v. Talon Petroleum, 907 F.2d 1012, 1017 (10th Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as the court supportably found in the instant case, a defendant has received actual notice of an action, service of process requirements are to be \"broadly interpreted,\"  see, e.g., Nowell v. Nowell, 384 F.2d 951 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 956 (1968);   Adams v. School Board, 53 F.R.D. 267, 268 (D.Pa. 1971), and \"substantial compliance\" with the requirements suffices,  see Precision Etchings, 953 F.2d at 24 (citing cases).  In cases where actual notice has been received, service on a person linked by a \"substantial nexus\" to the defendant has been held to meet the requirements of Rule 4(d)(1).   See Nowell, 384 F.2d at 953 (service on defendant's landlady who resided in separate apartment building from defendant found adequate where \"substantial nexus\" existed between landlady and defendant);   see also M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Austin, 430 F.Supp. 844, 845 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (daughter who was visiting home from school and stayed overnight was \"then residing\" at residence for purposes of Rule 4(d)(1)).  In the instant case, the record supportably shows that appellant's son answered the door at her house when she was not at home and was therefore a trusted member of the household.  In light of the \"substantial nexus\" between appellant and her son, we find no clear error in the court's implicit finding that appellant's son was \"residing\" in her house for the purposes of Rule 4(d)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court did not err in its denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also contends that the court erred in receiving and considering evidence on issues other than the adequacy of the service of process at the hearing.

The record indicates that the court was aware that the issue of the amount owed was not before the court but considered the information as \"background\" to the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.  Moreover, this background evidence was relevant to the court's finding that appellant had actual notice of the foreclosure action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We find no abuse of discretion in the court's consideration of this \"background\" evidence.  Furthermore, even though appellant had a limited time in which to prepare her response to the government's evidence of the amount due, we do not find that she suffered sufficient prejudice to implicate the federal due process clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of the motion to vacate the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The following evidence was presented at the hearing:</p>\n        <p>Counsel:  How do you know [the person served] was her son?</p>\n        <p>Marshall:  He told me he was Mrs. Lu[z] Ida Rodriguez's son.</p>\n        <p>Counsel: He told you.

R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) &amp; (6).  The gravamen of appellant's argument is that the judgment was void because the court lacked jurisdiction due to inadequate service of process.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1971, the Farmers Home Administration [FHA] granted appellant and her then husband a mortgage loan secured by a lien over appellant's property in Canvanas, Puerto Rico.  Appellant assumed the entire obligation after being divorced from her husband in 1972.  In September 1991, after appellant had fallen behind in the installment payments, the United States, on behalf of the FHA, filed a judicial action in federal district court for collection of money and foreclosure of the mortgage.  On September 24, 1991, a United States Deputy Marshall personally delivered to appellant's residence a copy of the summons and the complaint in this case.  The Deputy Marshall testified that the papers were accepted by appellant's son.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant failed to appear and a default judgment was entered on November 15, 1991.

According to affidavits filed with the motion, appellant attested that she had not been served with a copy of the complaint and that she had lived alone for the past four years.  Her son further attested that he had never been served with a copy of the summons or complaint.  Hearings were held in December 1992 and January 1993 at which oral and documentary evidence was presented.  Based on this evidence, the court found that the Deputy Marshall had served the appellant, through her son, at the appellant's dwelling place in accord with Fed.  R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1).  The court found the contrary attestations of appellant and her son to be not credible.  As a consequence, the court denied the motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that the district court erred in finding that process had been properly served upon her in this case.
