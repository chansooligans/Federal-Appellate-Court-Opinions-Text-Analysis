We\n\nassume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.\n\n       In order to be statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal, a non-permanent resident\n\nlike Bautista-Ramirez must have been “physically present in the United States for a continuous\n\nperiod of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of [his application for\n\ncancellation of removal],” 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(A), or the service of a Notice to Appear, id. §\n\n1229b(d)(1). This presence must have been continuous—an applicant cannot have departed the\n\nUnited States for any period in excess of 90 days or for any period in the aggregate exceeding\n\n180 days. Id. § 1229b(d)(2). Bautista-Ramirez received a Notice to Appear in June 1997, and\n\nthus had to have been physically present in the United States since June 1987. At his hearing\n\nbefore the Immigration Judge, Bautista-Ramirez testified credibly that he first entered the United\n\nStates in March 1985, and had only left the United States once, in 1988, for approximately two or\n\nthree months. Despite his credible testimony, the Immigration Judge concluded that there was no\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fproof that when Bautista-Ramirez entered the United States in 1988, he was returning to the\n\nUnited States or he had only been away for two or three months. Bautista-Ramirez appealed, and\n\nthe BIA dismissed his appeal, concluding that he had “fail[ed] to demonstrate by corroborative\n\nevidence that he maintained the requisite continuous physical presence to qualify for cancellation\n\nof removal, notwithstanding an alleged brief trip to Mexico.”\n\n       The government does not dispute our jurisdiction to review its continuous physical\n\npresence determination. See Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d 316, 320 (2d Cir. 2009); Sepulveda v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 59, 62-63 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the BIA’s continuous physical presence\n\ndetermination as a factual finding under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4). Our review, however, does not focus on whether there was substantial evidence\n\nsupporting the BIA’s determination that Bautista-Ramirez was not statutorily eligible for\n\ncancellation of removal, but instead on whether there was substantial evidence supporting the\n\nBIA’s determination that Bautista-Ramirez did not sufficiently demonstrate his statutory\n\neligibility. See Francis v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 131, 138-39 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n       Here, the BIA concluded that Bautista-Ramirez did not sufficiently demonstrate his\n\neligibility because he did not present corroborating evidence despite his credible testimony. On\n\nappeal, Bautista-Ramirez argues convincingly that it would be particularly difficult for him to\n\nproduce corroborating evidence of his presence as an undocumented illiterate migrant worker ten\n\nyears after the fact. He was never given an opportunity below, however, to explain to the agency\n\nwhy he could not be reasonably expected to produce such evidence. We therefore conclude that\n\nthe BIA’s determination that Bautista-Ramirez needed to produce corroborating evidence in\n\norder to sufficiently demonstrate his eligibility was not supported by substantial evidence. Cf. 8\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B) (“Where the immigration judge determines that the applicant should\n\nprovide evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be\n\nprovided unless the applicant demonstrates that the applicant does not have the evidence and\n\ncannot reasonably obtain the evidence.”). We give particular importance to the fact that the\n\nagency found Bautista-Ramirez’s testimony to be credible. We therefore remand to the BIA so\n\nas to give Bautista-Ramirez an opportunity to explain, and the agency an opportunity to consider,\n\nwhether he reasonably could be expected to produce corroborating evidence.\n\n       On appeal, Bautista-Ramirez also contends that the government violated the\n\nconfidentiality provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1160(b)(6)(A). Because Bautista-Ramirez’s Notice of\n\nAppeal, the only document he submitted to the BIA, does not mention this confidentiality\n\nprovision, and the BIA did not address it, Bautista-Ramirez failed to exhaust this argument, and\n\nwe do not address it here. See Steevenez v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 2007) (per\n\ncuriam) (“To preserve an issue for judicial review, the petitioner must first raise it with\n\nspecificity before the BIA.”).\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, the petition for review is GRANTED in part and\n\nDISMISSED in part. We VACATE the BIA’s decision, and REMAND to the BIA for further\n\nproceedings in conformance with this decision. As we have completed our review, the pending\n\nmotion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.\n\n       This panel will reassert jurisdiction to rule, if necessary, upon the issue of Bautista-\n\nRamirez’s request for cancellation of removal. See Shi Liang Lin v. DOJ, 416 F.3d 184, 192 (2d\n\nCir. 2005) (retaining jurisdiction to decide issues on appeal following remand to the BIA); cf.\n\nUnited States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir. 1994) (retaining jurisdiction while\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fremanding to the district court for supplementation of the record). Although the mandate shall\n\nissue forthwith, Bautista-Ramirez may return the case to this Court by notifying the Clerk of the\n\nCourt within thirty days of entry of a final BIA order on remand. Such notification will not\n\nrequire the filing of a new notice of appeal. If notification occurs, the matter will be referred\n\nautomatically to this panel for disposition.\n\n\n\n                                                   FOR THE COURT:\n                                                   CATHERINE O’HAGAN WOLFE, CLERK\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f",
