Petitioner Yubelkys Aponte is\n\na citizen of the Dominican Republic who seeks review of a decision\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying her motion to\n\nreopen removal proceedings.   Aponte argues that the BIA committed\n\nthree errors: first, it provided inadequate notice of a briefing\n\nschedule by mailing the schedule to an incomplete address; second,\n\nit violated her right to due process by summarily dismissing her\n\nappeal on the basis that she did not file a brief; third, it denied\n\nher motion to reopen despite the alleged due process violation.\n\nThe government argues that the mailing was proper and that Aponte\n\nhas failed to demonstrate prejudice, a necessary element of a due\n\nprocess violation. We grant the petition for review and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings in accordance with this decision.\n\n                          I. Background\n\n          Aponte was admitted to the United States as a Lawful\n\nPermanent Resident (LPR) on February 2, 1996. In 1999, Aponte pled\n\nguilty to Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the\n\nFifth Degree in the State of New York Oneida County Court.       On\n\nOctober 3, 2003, Aponte applied for admission to the United States\n\nas an LPR at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico.   On January 21, 2004, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against Aponte by\n\nserving her with a Notice to Appear.   DHS contended that Aponte was\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fremovable pursuant to § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (INA).       1\n\n\n             Aponte appeared with counsel before an Immigration Judge\n\n(IJ)   on    several    occasions,    admitting       to   the   allegations      and\n\nconceding removability.          The IJ granted over three years' worth of\n\ncontinuances while Aponte's counsel attempted to have Aponte's\n\ncriminal conviction expunged in New York.              On June 4, 2007, the IJ\n\nrefused to continue the case further and ordered Aponte removed.\n\n             Aponte, through counsel, filed a timely appeal to the BIA\n\non July 3, 2007.         The Notice of Appeal did not set forth any\n\nspecific reasons for the appeal but instead indicated that a brief\n\nwould be filed.        Aponte's counsel, Irena Zolotova, filed an entry\n\nof appearance at this time, using form EOIR-27.                  The EOIR-27 form\n\nincludes two consecutive boxes, the first labeled \"NAME OF ATTORNEY\n\nOR REPRESENTATIVE,\" the second labeled \"ADDRESS.\"                     In the first\n\nbox,    Zolotova    listed       herself    as    \"Irena    Zolotova,      Ross    &\n\n1\n  INA § 212(a)(2)(A),            codified    at   8   U.S.C.     §   1182(a)(2)(A),\nprovides as follows:\n\n       Except as provided in clause (ii), any alien convicted\n       of, or who admits having committed, or who admits\n       committing acts which constitute the essential elements\n       of —\n\n       ...\n\n       (II) a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to\n       violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United\n       States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled\n       substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21),\n\n       is inadmissible.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fAssociates.\" In the second box, Zolotova listed her address as \"20\n\nPark Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA 02116.\"\n\n            On January 11, 2008, the BIA mailed a notice of briefing\n\nschedule to \"Zolotova, Irena, 20 Park Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA\n\n02116,\" omitting the firm name \"Ross & Associates.\" Nowhere in the\n\nadministrative      record    does   any   contact    information        listed   by\n\nZolotova fail to include the firm name \"Ross & Associates.\"\n\n            The briefing schedule set a deadline of February 1, 2008\n\nfor Aponte's brief. Instead of a brief, however, the next document\n\nfiled with the BIA on Aponte's behalf was a \"Motion to Withdraw and\n\nSubstitute Counsel\" dated July 21, 2008 and filed by Attorney\n\nPhillip Jacobs.       In this motion, Jacobs indicated that Aponte no\n\nlonger retained Zolotova as counsel and requested the reissuance of\n\na briefing schedule.          Jacobs also filed an EOIR-27 Notice of\n\nAppearance. In the \"NAME\" box, Jacobs listed \"Phillip Jacobs.\" In\n\nthe    \"ADDRESS\"    box,   Jacobs    listed   \"20    Park   Plaza,   Ste.    633.\"\n\n            On     November   18,    2008,    the    BIA    issued   a    decision\n\ndismissing Aponte's appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2).                        2\n\n\n2\n    8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2) provides as follows:\n\n       Summary dismissal of appeals —\n\n       (i) Standards. A single Board member or panel may\n       summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in\n       any case in which:\n\n       (A) The party concerned fails to specify the reasons for\n       the appeal on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 (Notices of\n       Appeal) or other document filed therewith; [or]\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fThe BIA noted that Aponte had not indicated any specific reasons\n\nfor her appeal on the Notice of Appeal form, thus providing grounds\n\nfor summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A). The BIA\n\nfurther noted that despite indicating on the Notice of Appeal form\n\nthat she would be submitting a brief, Aponte neither filed a brief\n\nnor explained why she failed to file a brief, thus providing\n\ngrounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E).\n\nBecause Aponte did not explain her failure to file a brief, the BIA\n\ndenied Aponte's request for reissuance of a briefing schedule.\n\nHowever, the BIA did grant the motion to substitute counsel,\n\nallowing Jacobs to enter for Aponte.\n\n             On April 6, 2009, Attorney Sidra Vitale filed an EOIR-27\n\nNotice of Appearance indicating that she was entering for Aponte.\n\nIn the \"NAME\" box, Vitale listed \"Ross + Associates, Sidra Vitale,\n\nEsq.\"   In the \"ADDRESS\" box, Vitale listed \"20 Park Plaza, Boston,\n\nMA 02116.\"    On April 10, 2009, Vitale filed a \"Motion to Reopen and\n\nRe-issue Briefing Schedule for Defective Notice.\"        On Aponte's\n\nbehalf, Vitale argued that the BIA's failure to include \"Ross &\n\nAssociates\" in the address when mailing the briefing schedule to\n\nZolotova, despite the inclusion of the firm name on Zolotova's\n\n\n     ...\n\n     (E) The party concerned indicates on Form EOIR-26 or Form\n     EOIR-29 that he or she will file a brief or statement in\n     support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such\n     brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her\n     failure to do so, within the time set for filing[.]\n\n                                  -5-\n\fNotice of Appearance form, constituted inadequate notice.                 In\n\nsupport of this argument, Vitale filed an affidavit in which she\n\ntestified that neither she nor Aponte received timely notice of the\n\nbriefing schedule.      Vitale further testified that Aponte did not\n\nhave actual notice of the briefing schedule until the BIA issued\n\nits decision dismissing the appeal.3           There is no evidence that\n\neither   Aponte   or   any   of   her   attorneys   received   the   briefing\n\nschedule before receiving the decision dismissing her appeal;\n\nhowever, there is also no evidence as to precisely when counsel for\n\nAponte had actual notice of the briefing schedule.\n\n           On September 14, 2009, the BIA issued a written decision\n\ndenying the motion to reopen.           The BIA held that the information\n\nsupplied by Vitale was insufficient to establish inadequate notice.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the BIA relied solely on Tobeth-\n\nTangang v. Gonzales, 440 F.3d 537 (1st Cir. 2006), but failed to\n\nengage in any discussion or analysis of that case.\n\n           This petition for judicial review followed.                In it,\n\nAponte prays that we reverse the BIA's denial of her motion on the\n\nground that the BIA failed to provide her with adequate notice of\n\nthe briefing schedule, thereby depriving her of an opportunity to\n\nbe heard and violating her right to due process.           Aponte suggests\n\nthat reopening the removal proceedings to allow for briefing is the\n\n3\n  The affidavit makes reference to a decision dated September 16,\n2008; however, no such decision exists. It is clear from context,\nhowever, and the parties do not dispute, that the decision being\nreferenced is the BIA's November 18, 2008 decision.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fonly way to cure the alleged constitutional defect and to ensure a\n\nfull and fair proceeding before the BIA.\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n                            A. Jurisdiction\n\n            Before proceeding to the merits of the appeal, we note\n\nthat our jurisdiction over this matter is limited.                    The INA\n\nprovides generally that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review\n\nany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by\n\nreason of having committed\" certain criminal offenses, including\n\nany \"violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating\n\nto   a   controlled   substance   ...   .\"      8   U.S.C.   §   1252(a)(2)(C)\n\n(establishing jurisdictional bar); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) (providing\n\nthat a controlled substance violation is a basis for removal).\n\nHowever, in an exception to the general rule, this court retains\n\njurisdiction over \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised\n\nupon a petition for review ... .\"            8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); see\n\nalso Gourdet v. Holder, 587 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2009).                  It is\n\nuncontested that Aponte was convicted of a crime relating to a\n\ncontrolled substance; therefore, our review will be limited to any\n\nlegal issues stemming from the BIA's denial of Aponte's motion to\n\nreopen.    See Gourdet, 587 F.3d at 5.\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n            We review the BIA's decision to deny a motion to reopen\n\nunder the deferential abuse of discretion standard.                 Kucana v.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fHolder, 130 S.Ct. 827, 838 (2010); see also INS v. Doherty, 112\n\nS.Ct. 719, 724-25 (1992).   The abuse of discretion standard may be\n\ndeferential, but it is not toothless.    For example, we review the\n\nBIA's legal conclusions de novo.    See Tobeth-Tangang, 440 F.3d at\n\n539.   Any material error of law automatically constitutes an abuse\n\nof discretion.    Id.   We also review the adequacy of the BIA's\n\nexplanation, because \"cursory, summary or conclusory statements from\n\nthe Board leave us to presume nothing other than an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"   Onwuamaegbu v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 405, 412 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (quoting Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice, 265 F.3d 83,\n\n97 (2d Cir. 2001)). An inadequate explanation therefore constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion as well. Id. Finally, our review is limited\n\nto \"the basis articulated in the decision,\" and we \"may not assume\n\nthat the Board considered factors that it failed to mention in its\n\nopinion.\"   Daneshvar v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 615, 626 (6th Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Casem v. INS, 8 F.3d 700, 702 (9th Cir. 1993); Anderson v.\n\nMcElroy, 953 F.2d 803, 806 (2nd Cir. 1992)).     Thus we will vacate\n\nthe decision below if the BIA committed a material error of law or\n\nfailed to articulate its reasoning adequately.\n\n                        C. Framing the Issue\n\n            Aponte argues that the BIA committed a material error of\n\nlaw when it denied her motion to reopen.       Both Aponte and the\n\ngovernment spill most of their ink on the question of whether the\n\nBIA was bound to reopen the proceedings below in order to remedy a\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fdue process violation.     However, we are mindful of \"[t]he maxim\n\nthat courts should not decide constitutional issues when this can\n\nbe avoided\" and therefore do not reach the question of whether a\n\ndue process violation occurred. See U.S. v. Vilches-Navarette, 523\n\nF.3d 1, 9 n.6 (1st Cir. 2008).     Instead, we hold that the BIA's\n\ndecision is not an adequate disposition of an important issue —\n\nnamely, whether Aponte is entitled to have her appeal reopened due\n\nto inadequate notice of the briefing schedule.\n\n                 D. Inadequacy of the BIA's Decision\n\n            \"The motion to reopen is a procedural device,\" which\n\n\"serv[es] to ensure that aliens [get] a fair chance to have their\n\nclaims heard.\"      Kucana, 130 S.Ct. at 837 (internal quotation\n\nremoved).     Thus, courts have held that a motion to reopen is an\n\nappropriate vehicle for addressing a dismissal due to the absence\n\nof a petitioner's brief.   See Chen v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 76, 78-79\n\n(2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam); Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106-\n\n107 (3d Cir. 2005); Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th\n\nCir. 2004).    This court has held that the BIA properly denied an\n\nimmigrant's untimely motion to reopen where her attorney failed to\n\nprovide the BIA with an up-to-date address and therefore did not\n\nreceive a briefing schedule.   See Tobeth-Tangang, 440 F.3d at 539-\n\n40.   This court has also held that the BIA improperly denied an\n\nimmigrant's motion for reconsideration where his attorney provided\n\na correct address but failed to receive a briefing schedule due to\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthe BIA's erroneous mailing. See Hossain v. Gonzales, 381 F.3d 29,\n\n31-32 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Despite the existence of clear precedent for the BIA to\n\nwork from, the BIA failed to engage in any meaningful analysis when\n\nit denied Aponte's motion to reopen.              In its decision, the BIA\n\nfound: (1) that it mailed the briefing schedule \"to the address\n\nprovided by Irena Zolotova\"; (2) that there was \"no indication that\n\nthe briefing schedule was returned as undeliverable\"; (3) that the\n\nVitale affidavit \"does not provide sufficient detail as to when the\n\n[briefing schedule] was actually received\"; and (4) that its later\n\n\"decision was apparently received, as were apparently all the other\n\nnotices that were mailed to the same address without listing the\n\nname of the law firm.\"       The BIA then cited Tobeth-Tangang without\n\nengaging in any discussion of the case.\n\n              Most of the BIA's findings are misplaced. First, the BIA\n\ndid not mail the briefing schedule to the address provided by Irena\n\nZolotova, but instead omitted the firm name \"Ross & Associates.\"\n\nThe government argues that the firm name was not actually part of\n\nZolotova's address of record because it appeared in the \"NAME\" box\n\nrather than the \"ADDRESS\" box; however, this is a distinction\n\nwithout   a    difference.     The   BIA    can    no   more   omit   relevant\n\nidentifying information from the \"NAME\" box than it can from the\n\n\"ADDRESS\" box and still claim to have sent the mailing to a\n\ncomplete address.      Second, there may have been no indication that\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe briefing schedule was returned undeliverable, but there is\n\nlikewise no direct evidence in the record to indicate that the\n\nbriefing schedule was received.4      The BIA may not presume that a\n\nmailing to an incomplete address was received.         See Hossain, 381\n\nF.3d at 32 (\"The doctrine of regularity of the mail presumes the\n\naddress used is the correct one.\").       Third, the affidavit does not\n\nsufficiently indicate when the briefing schedule was received, but\n\nit is sufficient — if barely — to support a finding that the\n\nbriefing schedule was not timely received. Untimely receipt of the\n\nbriefing schedule could just as easily have kept Aponte from filing\n\na brief as no receipt at all.            Fourth, the BIA indicated no\n\nconclusive    basis   for   its   finding    that   Aponte's   attorneys\n\n\"apparently\" received all mailings subsequent to the briefing\n\nschedule.    It is unclear to us how these subsequent receipts were\n\napparent to the BIA given that there is nothing in the record to\n\nsupport such a finding.      And although Aponte's attorneys do not\n\nclaim that subsequent, incorrectly-addressed mailings were also\n\nlost, this does not by itself establish that they received the\n\ninitial briefing schedule.\n\n4\n  The government suggests that the BIA's inclusion of a suite\nnumber as part of the address serves as evidence that the briefing\nschedule was received. However, it appears that the BIA did not\nactually consider the suite number in rendering its decision.\nBecause our review is limited to \"the basis articulated in the\ndecision,\" and we \"may not assume that the Board considered factors\nthat it failed to mention in its opinion,\" Daneshvar, 355 F.3d at\n626, we will not address the suite number further save to note that\nthe BIA may consider it as circumstantial evidence on remand.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f          The BIA's reliance on Tobeth-Tangang is also misplaced.\n\nWe based our ruling in Tobeth-Tangang on the factual premise that\n\nthe petitioner's attorney violated BIA rules by failing to provide\n\nthe BIA with an updated address after moving to a new office.     See\n\n440 F.3d at 540 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e)).        Here, Aponte's\n\nattorney complied with BIA rules by providing a complete address on\n\nthe EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance form. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(3)\n\n(providing that the attorney for any alien must file an EOIR-27\n\nNotice of Appearance form).     When the BIA mailed the briefing\n\nschedule, it simply neglected to include part of the identifying\n\ninformation set forth on that form.        Because the BIA and not\n\ncounsel is at fault here, Tobeth-Tangang does not control the BIA's\n\ndecision, nor does it control ours.\n\n          We turn instead to Hossain, which deserves a thorough\n\ntreatment in view of its close similarity to this case.            In\n\nHossain, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain, a citizen of Bangladesh, sought\n\nrelief from exclusion.   381 F.3d at 30.   An IJ denied relief, and\n\nHossain appealed the decision to the BIA.     Id.   On his Notice of\n\nAppeal, Hossain requested the opportunity to file a brief.     Id. at\n\n30-31.   Hossain's attorney filed an entry of appearance, listing\n\nhis name and address as \"John Traficonte, Cabot Corporation, 75\n\nState Street, Boston, MA 02109.\"      Id. at 31.    The BIA, however,\n\nsent a briefing schedule to \"John Traficonte, 75 State Street,\n\nBoston, MA 02109,\" omitting the company name \"Cabot Corporation.\"\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fId.    Traficonte never received the briefing schedule and thus did\n\nnot file a brief.      Id.    Nevertheless, the BIA issued a decision\n\naffirming the IJ without opinion.           Id. at 30.      Hossain moved for\n\nreconsideration5 based solely on the fact that Traficonte never\n\nreceived the briefing schedule and therefore did not file a brief.\n\nId. at 31.    The BIA denied the motion, finding no defect in service\n\nof the briefing schedule.      Id.\n\n             This court vacated the decision of the BIA and remanded\n\nfor further proceedings.       Hossain, 381 F.3d at 33.            We held that\n\nthe BIA had committed an error by mailing the briefing schedule to\n\nan    incomplete   address.    Id.    at    31-32;   see    also   8   C.F.R.   §\n\n1003.3(c)(1) (providing that an alien has a right to file a brief\n\nsubject to a briefing schedule set by the BIA).               We directed the\n\nBIA to allow a renewed motion for reconsideration and to decide\n\nthat motion in accordance with our decision.           Hossain, 381 F.3d at\n\n33.\n\n             The close similarity between the facts here and those in\n\nHossain leads us to the same resolution.                   In each case, the\n\npetitioner's attorney properly submitted an entry of appearance\n\n5\n  Although Hossain concerns a motion for reconsideration, while\nthis case concerns a motion to reopen, both types of motions are\nappropriate means of addressing a petitioner's failure to file a\ntimely brief.   However, a motion to reopen is more appropriate\nwhere, as here, new evidence is presented — in this case, the\naffidavit of Aponte's counsel. See Arias-Valencia v. Mukasey, 529\nF.3d 428, 430 n.1 (1st Cir. 2008); Tandayu v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 97,\n99 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008). We apply the abuse of discretion standard\nto both types of motions on review. See Arias-Valencia, 529 F.3d\nat 430 n.1.\n\n                                     -13-\n\flisting a valid name and address.                Hossain, 381 F.3d at 31.           In\n\neach case, the BIA left out a piece of identifying information — in\n\nHossain the company name and in this case the firm name — when\n\nsending a briefing schedule to the attorney.                  Id.     In each case,\n\nthe petitioner's attorney failed to receive the briefing schedule\n\nin time to file a brief.             Id.        Thus, Hossain would appear to\n\ncontrol on these facts, and we remand for the BIA (1) to provide\n\nAponte with an opportunity to file a renewed motion to reopen, and\n\n(2) to decide that motion in accordance with this decision.\n\n             However, this remand comes with a caveat.                   We note again\n\nthat   the   affidavit    presented        by    Aponte's    attorney       is   barely\n\nsufficient to establish that the briefing schedule was not timely\n\nreceived.     The affidavit's shortage of details seems to indicate\n\nthat   it    is   a   product   of   either       hasty     work    or    intentional\n\nobfuscation, and its sparsity should certainly be addressed in the\n\nrenewed motion to reopen. In particular, the issue of when counsel\n\nactually received the briefing schedule, if ever, stands out to us\n\nas requiring clarification, just as it did to the BIA.                     Indeed, if\n\nany attorney representing Aponte actually received the briefing\n\nschedule before the case was dismissed, then Hossain carries much\n\nless force here than it would if counsel never received the\n\nbriefing schedule.        Cf. 381 F.3d at 31 (stating that Hossain's\n\nattorney never received a briefing schedule).                      Whatever the new\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\faffidavit provides, the BIA still must apply the law to the record\n\nevidence before it and determine whether to reopen Aponte's appeal.\n\n            We also call attention to the Supreme Court's statement\n\nin Kucana that \"[a] court decision reversing the denial of a motion\n\nto reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien\n\nsubstantive relief,\" but instead \"touches and concerns only the\n\nquestion whether the alien's claims have been accorded a reasonable\n\nhearing.\"    Kucana, 130 S.Ct. at 837.      Despite our conclusion that\n\nAponte did not receive a reasonable hearing, she still has a very\n\ndifficult path ahead of her in order to obtain any substantive\n\nrelief.     The record indicates that she has had great difficulty\n\ngetting her record expunged in New York and suggests no other basis\n\nfor relief from removal.       Furthermore, even if the BIA does elect\n\nto reopen the appeal, the merits are for it to determine as long as\n\nit   acts   within   the   parameters   established   by   law.   Overall,\n\nAponte's likelihood of succeeding on the merits might well be\n\nnegligible.    However, the BIA must at least cast a more critical\n\neye on its mailing procedure here and make certain that Aponte\n\nreceives the full benefit of the administrative process that\n\nCongress has elected to provide for her.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n            The BIA abused its discretion by issuing an inadequately\n\nreasoned decision denying Aponte's motion to reopen.          Accordingly,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fwe grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further\n\nproceedings in accordance with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

Payne, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, and Lindsay S. Williams, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, LIPEZ, and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Yubelkys Aponte is a citizen of the Dominican Republic who seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. Aponte argues that the BIA committed three errors: first, it provided inadequate notice of a briefing schedule by mailing the schedule to an incomplete address; second, it violated her right to due process by summarily dismissing her appeal on the basis that she did not file a brief; third, it denied her motion to reopen despite the alleged due process violation. The government argues that the mailing was proper and that Aponte has failed to demonstrate prejudice, a necessary element of a due process violation. We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Aponte was admitted to the United States as a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) on February 2, 1996. In 1999, Aponte pled guilty to Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Fifth Degree in the State of New York Oneida County Court. On October 3, 2003, Aponte applied for admission to the United States as an LPR at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 21, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against Aponte by serving her with a Notice to Appear. DHS contended that Aponte was removable pursuant to § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Aponte appeared with counsel before an Immigration Judge (IJ) on several occasions, admitting to the allegations and conceding removability. The IJ granted over three years' worth of continuances while Aponte's counsel attempted to have Aponte's criminal conviction expunged in New York. On June 4, 2007, the IJ refused to continue the case further and ordered Aponte removed.</p>\n<p>Aponte, through counsel, filed a timely appeal to the BIA on July 3, 2007. The Notice of Appeal did not set forth any specific reasons for the appeal but instead indicated that a brief would be filed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> Aponte's counsel, Irena Zolotova, filed an entry of appearance at this time, using form EOIR-27. The EOIR-27 form includes two consecutive boxes, the first labeled \"NAME OF ATTORNEY OR REPRESENTATIVE,\" the second labeled \"ADDRESS.\" In the first box, Zolotova listed herself as \"Irena Zolotova, Ross &amp; Associates.\" In the second box, Zolotova listed her address as \"20 Park Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA 02116.\"</p>\n<p>On January 11, 2008, the BIA mailed a notice of briefing schedule to \"Zolotova, Irena, 20 Park Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA 02116,\" omitting the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\" Nowhere in the administrative record does any contact information listed by Zolotova fail to include the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\"</p>\n<p>The briefing schedule set a deadline of February 1, 2008 for Aponte's brief. Instead of a brief, however, the next document filed with the BIA on Aponte's behalf was a \"Motion to Withdraw and Substitute Counsel\" dated July 21, 2008 and filed by Attorney Phillip Jacobs. In this motion, Jacobs indicated that Aponte no longer retained Zolotova as counsel and requested the reissuance of a briefing schedule. Jacobs also filed an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance. In the \"NAME\" box, Jacobs listed \"Phillip Jacobs.\" In the \"ADDRESS\" box, Jacobs listed \"20 Park Plaza, Ste. 633.\"</p>\n<p>On November 18, 2008, the BIA issued a decision dismissing Aponte's appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2).<sup>[2]</sup> The BIA noted that Aponte had not indicated any specific reasons for her appeal on the Notice of Appeal form, thus providing grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A). The BIA further noted that despite indicating on the Notice of Appeal form that she would be submitting a brief, Aponte neither filed a brief nor explained why she failed to file a brief, thus providing grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). Because Aponte did not explain her failure to file a brief, the BIA denied Aponte's request for reissuance of a briefing schedule. However, the BIA did grant the motion to substitute counsel, allowing Jacobs to enter for Aponte.</p>\n<p>On April 6, 2009, Attorney Sidra Vitale filed an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance indicating that she was entering for Aponte. In the \"NAME\" box, Vitale listed \"Ross + Associates, Sidra Vitale, Esq.\" In the \"ADDRESS\" box, Vitale listed \"20 Park Plaza, Boston, MA 02116.\" On April 10, 2009, Vitale filed a \"Motion to Reopen and Re-issue Briefing Schedule for Defective Notice.\" On Aponte's behalf, Vitale argued that the BIA's failure to include \"Ross &amp; Associates\" in the address when mailing the briefing schedule to Zolotova, despite the inclusion of the firm name on Zolotova's Notice of Appearance form, constituted inadequate notice. In support of this argument, Vitale filed an affidavit in which she testified that neither she nor Aponte received timely notice of the briefing schedule. Vitale further testified that Aponte did not have actual notice of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> briefing schedule until the BIA issued its decision dismissing the appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> There is no evidence that either Aponte or any of her attorneys received the briefing schedule before receiving the decision dismissing her appeal; however, there is also no evidence as to precisely when counsel for Aponte had actual notice of the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p>On September 14, 2009, the BIA issued a written decision denying the motion to reopen. The BIA held that the information supplied by Vitale was insufficient to establish inadequate notice. In reaching this conclusion, the BIA relied solely on <i>Tobeth-Tangang v. Gonzales,</i> 440 F.3d 537 (1st Cir.2006), but failed to engage in any discussion or analysis of that case.</p>\n<p>This petition for judicial review followed. In it, Aponte prays that we reverse the BIA's denial of her motion on the ground that the BIA failed to provide her with adequate notice of the briefing schedule, thereby depriving her of an opportunity to be heard and violating her right to due process. Aponte suggests that reopening the removal proceedings to allow for briefing is the only way to cure the alleged constitutional defect and to ensure a full and fair proceeding before the BIA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding to the merits of the appeal, we note that our jurisdiction over this matter is limited. The INA provides generally that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\" certain criminal offenses, including any \"violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) (establishing jurisdictional bar); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) (providing that a controlled substance violation is a basis for removal). However, in an exception to the general rule, this court retains jurisdiction over \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); <i>see also </i><i>Gourdet v. Holder,</i> 587 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2009). It is uncontested that Aponte was convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance; therefore, our review will be limited to any legal issues stemming from the BIA's denial of Aponte's motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Gourdet,</i> 587 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the BIA's decision to deny a motion to reopen under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <i>Kucana v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 827, 838, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010); <i>see also </i><i>INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). The abuse of discretion standard may be deferential, but it is not toothless. For example, we review the BIA's legal conclusions <i>de novo. See </i><i>Tobeth-Tangang,</i> 440 F.3d at 539. Any material error of law automatically constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> We also review the adequacy of the BIA's explanation, because \"cursory, summary or conclusory statements from the Board leave us to presume nothing other than an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Onwuamaegbu v. Gonzales,</i> 470 F.3d 405, 412 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> 265 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir.2001)). An inadequate explanation therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion as well. <i>Id.</i> Finally, our review is limited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> to \"the basis articulated in the decision,\" and we \"may not assume that the Board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion.\" <i>Daneshvar v. Ashcroft,</i> 355 F.3d 615, 626 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <i>Casem v. INS,</i> 8 F.3d 700, 702 (9th Cir. 1993); <i>Anderson v. McElroy,</i> 953 F.2d 803, 806 (2nd Cir.1992)). Thus we will vacate the decision below if the BIA committed a material error of law or failed to articulate its reasoning adequately.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Framing the Issue</h2>\n<p>Aponte argues that the BIA committed a material error of law when it denied her motion to reopen. Both Aponte and the government spill most of their ink on the question of whether the BIA was bound to reopen the proceedings below in order to remedy a due process violation. However, we are mindful of \"[t]he maxim that courts should not decide constitutional issues when this can be avoided\" and therefore do not reach the question of whether a due process violation occurred. <i>See </i><i>U.S. v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 9 n. 6 (1st Cir.2008). Instead, we hold that the BIA's decision is not an adequate disposition of an important issue-namely, whether Aponte is entitled to have her appeal reopened due to inadequate notice of the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Inadequacy of the BIA's Decision</h2>\n<p>\"The motion to reopen is a procedural device,\" which \"serv[es] to ensure that aliens [get] a fair chance to have their claims heard.\" <i>Kucana,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 837 (internal quotation removed). Thus, courts have held that a motion to reopen is an appropriate vehicle for addressing a dismissal due to the absence of a petitioner's brief. <i>See </i><i>Chen v. Gonzales,</i> 436 F.3d 76, 78-79 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam); <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 422 F.3d 98, 106-107 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Singh v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004). This court has held that the BIA properly denied an immigrant's untimely motion to reopen where her attorney failed to provide the BIA with an up-to-date address and therefore did not receive a briefing schedule. <i>See </i><i>Tobeth-Tangang,</i> 440 F.3d at 539-40. This court has also held that the BIA improperly denied an immigrant's motion for reconsideration where his attorney provided a correct address but failed to receive a briefing schedule due to the BIA's erroneous mailing. <i>See Hossain v. Gonzales,</i> 381 F.3d 29, 31-32 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Despite the existence of clear precedent for the BIA to work from, the BIA failed to engage in any meaningful analysis when it denied Aponte's motion to reopen. In its decision, the BIA found: (1) that it mailed the briefing schedule \"to the address provided by Irena Zolotova\"; (2) that there was \"no indication that the briefing schedule was returned as undeliverable\"; (3) that the Vitale affidavit \"does not provide sufficient detail as to when the [briefing schedule] was actually received\"; and (4) that its later \"decision was apparently received, as were apparently all the other notices that were mailed to the same address without listing the name of the law firm.\" The BIA then cited <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> without engaging in any discussion of the case.</p>\n<p>Most of the BIA's findings are misplaced. First, the BIA did not mail the briefing schedule to the address provided by Irena Zolotova, but instead omitted the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\" The government argues that the firm name was not actually part of Zolotova's address of record because it appeared in the \"NAME\" box rather than the \"ADDRESS\" box; however, this is a distinction without a difference. The BIA can no more omit relevant identifying information from the \"NAME\" box than it can from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> the \"ADDRESS\" box and still claim to have sent the mailing to a complete address. Second, there may have been no indication that the briefing schedule was returned undeliverable, but there is likewise no direct evidence in the record to indicate that the briefing schedule was received.<sup>[4]</sup> The BIA may not presume that a mailing to an incomplete address was received. <i>See Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 32 (\"The doctrine of regularity of the mail presumes the address used is the correct one.\"). Third, the affidavit does not sufficiently indicate when the briefing schedule was received, but it is sufficientif barelyto support a finding that the briefing schedule was not timely received. Untimely receipt of the briefing schedule could just as easily have kept Aponte from filing a brief as no receipt at all. Fourth, the BIA indicated no conclusive basis for its finding that Aponte's attorneys \"apparently\" received all mailings subsequent to the briefing schedule. It is unclear to us how these subsequent receipts were apparent to the BIA given that there is nothing in the record to support such a finding. And although Aponte's attorneys do not claim that subsequent, incorrectly-addressed mailings were also lost, this does not by itself establish that they received the initial briefing schedule.</p>\n<p>The BIA's reliance on <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> is also misplaced. We based our ruling in <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> on the factual premise that the petitioner's attorney violated BIA rules by failing to provide the BIA with an updated address after moving to a new office. <i>See</i> 440 F.3d at 540 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e)). Here, Aponte's attorney complied with BIA rules by providing a complete address on the EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance form. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(3) (providing that the attorney for any alien must file an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance form). When the BIA mailed the briefing schedule, it simply neglected to include part of the identifying information set forth on that form. Because the BIA and not counsel is at fault here, <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> does not control the BIA's decision, nor does it control ours.</p>\n<p>We turn instead to <i>Hossain,</i> which deserves a thorough treatment in view of its close similarity to this case. In <i>Hossain,</i> Mohammed Mozammel Hossain, a citizen of Bangladesh, sought relief from exclusion. 381 F.3d at 30. An IJ denied relief, and Hossain appealed the decision to the BIA. <i>Id.</i> On his Notice of Appeal, Hossain requested the opportunity to file a brief. <i>Id.</i> at 30-31. Hossain's attorney filed an entry of appearance, listing his name and address as \"John Traficonte, Cabot Corporation, 75 State Street, Boston, MA 02109.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. The BIA, however, sent a briefing schedule to \"John Traficonte, 75 State Street, Boston, MA 02109,\" omitting the company name \"Cabot Corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> Traficonte never received the briefing schedule and thus did not file a brief. <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, the BIA issued a decision affirming the IJ without opinion. <i>Id.</i> at 30. Hossain moved for reconsideration<sup>[5]</sup> based solely on the fact that Traficonte <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> never received the briefing schedule and therefore did not file a brief. <i>Id.</i> at 31. The BIA denied the motion, finding no defect in service of the briefing schedule. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This court vacated the decision of the BIA and remanded for further proceedings. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 33. We held that the BIA had committed an error by mailing the briefing schedule to an incomplete address. <i>Id.</i> at 31-32; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(c)(1) (providing that an alien has a right to file a brief subject to a briefing schedule set by the BIA). We directed the BIA to allow a renewed motion for reconsideration and to decide that motion in accordance with our decision. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>The close similarity between the facts here and those in <i>Hossain</i> leads us to the same resolution. In each case, the petitioner's attorney properly submitted an entry of appearance listing a valid name and address. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 31. In each case, the BIA left out a piece of identifying informationin <i>Hossain</i> the company name and in this case the firm namewhen sending a briefing schedule to the attorney. <i>Id.</i> In each case, the petitioner's attorney failed to receive the briefing schedule in time to file a brief. <i>Id.</i> Thus, <i>Hossain</i> would appear to control on these facts, and we remand for the BIA (1) to provide Aponte with an opportunity to file a renewed motion to reopen, and (2) to decide that motion in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p>However, this remand comes with a caveat. We note again that the affidavit presented by Aponte's attorney is barely sufficient to establish that the briefing schedule was not timely received. The affidavit's shortage of details seems to indicate that it is a product of either hasty work or intentional obfuscation, and its sparsity should certainly be addressed in the renewed motion to reopen. In particular, the issue of when counsel actually received the briefing schedule, if ever, stands out to us as requiring clarification, just as it did to the BIA. Indeed, if any attorney representing Aponte actually received the briefing schedule before the case was dismissed, then <i>Hossain</i> carries much less force here than it would if counsel never received the briefing schedule. <i>Cf.</i> 381 F.3d at 31 (stating that Hossain's attorney never received a briefing schedule). Whatever the new affidavit provides, the BIA still must apply the law to the record evidence before it and determine whether to reopen Aponte's appeal.</p>\n<p>We also call attention to the Supreme Court's statement in <i>Kucana</i> that \"[a] court decision reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien substantive relief,\" but instead \"touches and concerns only the question whether the alien's claims have been accorded a reasonable hearing.\" <i>Kucana,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 837. Despite our conclusion that Aponte did not receive a reasonable hearing, she still has a very difficult path ahead of her in order to obtain any substantive relief. The record indicates that she has had great difficulty getting her record expunged in New York and suggests no other basis for relief from removal. Furthermore, even if the BIA does elect to reopen the appeal, the merits are for it to determine as long as it acts within the parameters established by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> law. Overall, Aponte's likelihood of succeeding on the merits might well be negligible. However, the BIA must at least cast a more critical eye on its mailing procedure here and make certain that Aponte receives the full benefit of the administrative process that Congress has elected to provide for her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The BIA abused its discretion by issuing an inadequately reasoned decision denying Aponte's motion to reopen. Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> the petition for review and <i>remand</i> to the BIA for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  INA § 212(a)(2)(A), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A), provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Except as provided in clause (ii), any alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(II) a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), is inadmissible.</p>\n<p>[2]  8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2) provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Summary dismissal of appeals</p>\n<p>(i) Standards. A single Board member or panel may summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in any case in which:</p>\n<p>(A) The party concerned fails to specify the reasons for the appeal on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 (Notices of Appeal) or other document filed therewith; [or]</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(E) The party concerned indicates on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing[.]</p>\n<p>[3]  The affidavit makes reference to a decision dated September 16, 2008; however, no such decision exists. It is clear from context, however, and the parties do not dispute, that the decision being referenced is the BIA's November 18, 2008 decision.</p>\n<p>[4]  The government suggests that the BIA's inclusion of a suite number as part of the address serves as evidence that the briefing schedule was received. However, it appears that the BIA did not actually consider the suite number in rendering its decision. Because our review is limited to \"the basis articulated in the decision,\" and we \"may not assume that the Board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion,\" <i>Daneshvar,</i> 355 F.3d at 626, we will not address the suite number further save to note that the BIA may consider it as circumstantial evidence on remand.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although <i>Hossain</i> concerns a motion for reconsideration, while this case concerns a motion to reopen, both types of motions are appropriate means of addressing a petitioner's failure to file a timely brief.

Aponte argues that the BIA committed three errors: first, it provided inadequate notice of a briefing schedule by mailing the schedule to an incomplete address; second, it violated her right to due process by summarily dismissing her appeal on the basis that she did not file a brief; third, it denied her motion to reopen despite the alleged due process violation. The government argues that the mailing was proper and that Aponte has failed to demonstrate prejudice, a necessary element of a due process violation. We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Aponte was admitted to the United States as a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) on February 2, 1996. In 1999, Aponte pled guilty to Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Fifth Degree in the State of New York Oneida County Court. On October 3, 2003, Aponte applied for admission to the United States as an LPR at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 21, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against Aponte by serving her with a Notice to Appear. DHS contended that Aponte was removable pursuant to § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Aponte appeared with counsel before an Immigration Judge (IJ) on several occasions, admitting to the allegations and conceding removability. The IJ granted over three years' worth of continuances while Aponte's counsel attempted to have Aponte's criminal conviction expunged in New York. On June 4, 2007, the IJ refused to continue the case further and ordered Aponte removed.</p>\n<p>Aponte, through counsel, filed a timely appeal to the BIA on July 3, 2007. The Notice of Appeal did not set forth any specific reasons for the appeal but instead indicated that a brief would be filed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> Aponte's counsel, Irena Zolotova, filed an entry of appearance at this time, using form EOIR-27. The EOIR-27 form includes two consecutive boxes, the first labeled \"NAME OF ATTORNEY OR REPRESENTATIVE,\" the second labeled \"ADDRESS.\" In the first box, Zolotova listed herself as \"Irena Zolotova, Ross &amp; Associates.\" In the second box, Zolotova listed her address as \"20 Park Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA 02116.\"</p>\n<p>On January 11, 2008, the BIA mailed a notice of briefing schedule to \"Zolotova, Irena, 20 Park Plaza, Suite 633, Boston, MA 02116,\" omitting the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\" Nowhere in the administrative record does any contact information listed by Zolotova fail to include the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\"</p>\n<p>The briefing schedule set a deadline of February 1, 2008 for Aponte's brief. Instead of a brief, however, the next document filed with the BIA on Aponte's behalf was a \"Motion to Withdraw and Substitute Counsel\" dated July 21, 2008 and filed by Attorney Phillip Jacobs. In this motion, Jacobs indicated that Aponte no longer retained Zolotova as counsel and requested the reissuance of a briefing schedule. Jacobs also filed an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance. In the \"NAME\" box, Jacobs listed \"Phillip Jacobs.\" In the \"ADDRESS\" box, Jacobs listed \"20 Park Plaza, Ste. 633.\"</p>\n<p>On November 18, 2008, the BIA issued a decision dismissing Aponte's appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2).<sup>[2]</sup> The BIA noted that Aponte had not indicated any specific reasons for her appeal on the Notice of Appeal form, thus providing grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A). The BIA further noted that despite indicating on the Notice of Appeal form that she would be submitting a brief, Aponte neither filed a brief nor explained why she failed to file a brief, thus providing grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). Because Aponte did not explain her failure to file a brief, the BIA denied Aponte's request for reissuance of a briefing schedule. However, the BIA did grant the motion to substitute counsel, allowing Jacobs to enter for Aponte.</p>\n<p>On April 6, 2009, Attorney Sidra Vitale filed an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance indicating that she was entering for Aponte. In the \"NAME\" box, Vitale listed \"Ross + Associates, Sidra Vitale, Esq.\" In the \"ADDRESS\" box, Vitale listed \"20 Park Plaza, Boston, MA 02116.\" On April 10, 2009, Vitale filed a \"Motion to Reopen and Re-issue Briefing Schedule for Defective Notice.\" On Aponte's behalf, Vitale argued that the BIA's failure to include \"Ross &amp; Associates\" in the address when mailing the briefing schedule to Zolotova, despite the inclusion of the firm name on Zolotova's Notice of Appearance form, constituted inadequate notice. In support of this argument, Vitale filed an affidavit in which she testified that neither she nor Aponte received timely notice of the briefing schedule. Vitale further testified that Aponte did not have actual notice of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> briefing schedule until the BIA issued its decision dismissing the appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> There is no evidence that either Aponte or any of her attorneys received the briefing schedule before receiving the decision dismissing her appeal; however, there is also no evidence as to precisely when counsel for Aponte had actual notice of the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p>On September 14, 2009, the BIA issued a written decision denying the motion to reopen. The BIA held that the information supplied by Vitale was insufficient to establish inadequate notice. In reaching this conclusion, the BIA relied solely on <i>Tobeth-Tangang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202098\"><a href=\"/opinion/202098/tobeth-tangang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006), but failed to engage in any discussion or analysis of that case.</p>\n<p>This petition for judicial review followed. In it, Aponte prays that we reverse the BIA's denial of her motion on the ground that the BIA failed to provide her with adequate notice of the briefing schedule, thereby depriving her of an opportunity to be heard and violating her right to due process. Aponte suggests that reopening the removal proceedings to allow for briefing is the only way to cure the alleged constitutional defect and to ensure a full and fair proceeding before the BIA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding to the merits of the appeal, we note that our jurisdiction over this matter is limited. The INA provides generally that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\" certain criminal offenses, including any \"violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) (establishing jurisdictional bar); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2) (providing that a controlled substance violation is a basis for removal). However, in an exception to the general rule, this court retains jurisdiction over \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); <i>see also </i><i>Gourdet v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204053\"><a href=\"/opinion/204053/gourdet-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2009). It is uncontested that Aponte was convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance; therefore, our review will be limited to any legal issues stemming from the BIA's denial of Aponte's motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Gourdet,</i> 587 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the BIA's decision to deny a motion to reopen under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <i>Kucana v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1744\"><a href=\"/opinion/1744/kucana-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 838, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010); <i>see also </i><i>INS v. Doherty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 724-25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span> (1992). The abuse of discretion standard may be deferential, but it is not toothless. For example, we review the BIA's legal conclusions <i>de novo. See </i><i>Tobeth-Tangang,</i> 440 F.3d at 539. Any material error of law automatically constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> We also review the adequacy of the BIA's explanation, because \"cursory, summary or conclusory statements from the Board leave us to presume nothing other than an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Onwuamaegbu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202531\"><a href=\"/opinion/202531/onwuamaegbu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 412 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774878\"><a href=\"/opinion/774878/ke-zhen-zhao-v-united-states-department-of-justice-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 97 (2d Cir.2001)). An inadequate explanation therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion as well. <i>Id.</i> Finally, our review is limited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> to \"the basis articulated in the decision,\" and we \"may not assume that the Board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion.\" <i>Daneshvar v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784795\"><a href=\"/opinion/784795/mohammad-reza-daneshvar-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 626 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <i>Casem v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656188\"><a href=\"/opinion/656188/filipinas-lucero-casem-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 702 (9th Cir. 1993); <i>Anderson v. McElroy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575837\"><a href=\"/opinion/575837/reginald-john-anderson-v-edward-j-mcelroy-assistant-district-director-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 806 (2nd Cir.1992)). Thus we will vacate the decision below if the BIA committed a material error of law or failed to articulate its reasoning adequately.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Framing the Issue</h2>\n<p>Aponte argues that the BIA committed a material error of law when it denied her motion to reopen. Both Aponte and the government spill most of their ink on the question of whether the BIA was bound to reopen the proceedings below in order to remedy a due process violation. However, we are mindful of \"[t]he maxim that courts should not decide constitutional issues when this can be avoided\" and therefore do not reach the question of whether a due process violation occurred. <i>See </i><i>U.S. v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203232\"><a href=\"/opinion/203232/united-states-v-vilches-navarrete/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 n. 6 (1st Cir.2008). Instead, we hold that the BIA's decision is not an adequate disposition of an important issue-namely, whether Aponte is entitled to have her appeal reopened due to inadequate notice of the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Inadequacy of the BIA's Decision</h2>\n<p>\"The motion to reopen is a procedural device,\" which \"serv[es] to ensure that aliens [get] a fair chance to have their claims heard.\" <i>Kucana,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 837 (internal quotation removed). Thus, courts have held that a motion to reopen is an appropriate vehicle for addressing a dismissal due to the absence of a petitioner's brief. <i>See </i><i>Chen v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793129\"><a href=\"/opinion/793129/jie-chen-v-alberto-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 78-79 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam); <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791779\"><a href=\"/opinion/791779/zheng-zheng-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 106-107 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Singh v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786156\"><a href=\"/opinion/786156/amarjit-singh-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span>, 1185 (9th Cir.2004). This court has held that the BIA properly denied an immigrant's untimely motion to reopen where her attorney failed to provide the BIA with an up-to-date address and therefore did not receive a briefing schedule. <i>See </i><i>Tobeth-Tangang,</i> 440 F.3d at 539-40. This court has also held that the BIA improperly denied an immigrant's motion for reconsideration where his attorney provided a correct address but failed to receive a briefing schedule due to the BIA's erroneous mailing. <i>See Hossain v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201211\"><a href=\"/opinion/201211/hossain-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31-32 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Despite the existence of clear precedent for the BIA to work from, the BIA failed to engage in any meaningful analysis when it denied Aponte's motion to reopen. In its decision, the BIA found: (1) that it mailed the briefing schedule \"to the address provided by Irena Zolotova\"; (2) that there was \"no indication that the briefing schedule was returned as undeliverable\"; (3) that the Vitale affidavit \"does not provide sufficient detail as to when the [briefing schedule] was actually received\"; and (4) that its later \"decision was apparently received, as were apparently all the other notices that were mailed to the same address without listing the name of the law firm.\" The BIA then cited <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> without engaging in any discussion of the case.</p>\n<p>Most of the BIA's findings are misplaced. First, the BIA did not mail the briefing schedule to the address provided by Irena Zolotova, but instead omitted the firm name \"Ross &amp; Associates.\" The government argues that the firm name was not actually part of Zolotova's address of record because it appeared in the \"NAME\" box rather than the \"ADDRESS\" box; however, this is a distinction without a difference. The BIA can no more omit relevant identifying information from the \"NAME\" box than it can from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> the \"ADDRESS\" box and still claim to have sent the mailing to a complete address. Second, there may have been no indication that the briefing schedule was returned undeliverable, but there is likewise no direct evidence in the record to indicate that the briefing schedule was received.<sup>[4]</sup> The BIA may not presume that a mailing to an incomplete address was received. <i>See Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 32 (\"The doctrine of regularity of the mail presumes the address used is the correct one.\"). Third, the affidavit does not sufficiently indicate when the briefing schedule was received, but it is sufficientif barelyto support a finding that the briefing schedule was not timely received. Untimely receipt of the briefing schedule could just as easily have kept Aponte from filing a brief as no receipt at all. Fourth, the BIA indicated no conclusive basis for its finding that Aponte's attorneys \"apparently\" received all mailings subsequent to the briefing schedule. It is unclear to us how these subsequent receipts were apparent to the BIA given that there is nothing in the record to support such a finding. And although Aponte's attorneys do not claim that subsequent, incorrectly-addressed mailings were also lost, this does not by itself establish that they received the initial briefing schedule.</p>\n<p>The BIA's reliance on <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> is also misplaced. We based our ruling in <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> on the factual premise that the petitioner's attorney violated BIA rules by failing to provide the BIA with an updated address after moving to a new office. <i>See</i> 440 F.3d at 540 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e)). Here, Aponte's attorney complied with BIA rules by providing a complete address on the EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance form. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(3) (providing that the attorney for any alien must file an EOIR-27 Notice of Appearance form). When the BIA mailed the briefing schedule, it simply neglected to include part of the identifying information set forth on that form. Because the BIA and not counsel is at fault here, <i>Tobeth-Tangang</i> does not control the BIA's decision, nor does it control ours.</p>\n<p>We turn instead to <i>Hossain,</i> which deserves a thorough treatment in view of its close similarity to this case. In <i>Hossain,</i> Mohammed Mozammel Hossain, a citizen of Bangladesh, sought relief from exclusion. 381 F.3d at 30. An IJ denied relief, and Hossain appealed the decision to the BIA. <i>Id.</i> On his Notice of Appeal, Hossain requested the opportunity to file a brief. <i>Id.</i> at 30-31. Hossain's attorney filed an entry of appearance, listing his name and address as \"John Traficonte, Cabot Corporation, 75 State Street, Boston, MA 02109.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. The BIA, however, sent a briefing schedule to \"John Traficonte, 75 State Street, Boston, MA 02109,\" omitting the company name \"Cabot Corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> Traficonte never received the briefing schedule and thus did not file a brief. <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, the BIA issued a decision affirming the IJ without opinion. <i>Id.</i> at 30. Hossain moved for reconsideration<sup>[5]</sup> based solely on the fact that Traficonte <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> never received the briefing schedule and therefore did not file a brief. <i>Id.</i> at 31. The BIA denied the motion, finding no defect in service of the briefing schedule. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This court vacated the decision of the BIA and remanded for further proceedings. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 33. We held that the BIA had committed an error by mailing the briefing schedule to an incomplete address. <i>Id.</i> at 31-32; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(c)(1) (providing that an alien has a right to file a brief subject to a briefing schedule set by the BIA). We directed the BIA to allow a renewed motion for reconsideration and to decide that motion in accordance with our decision. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>The close similarity between the facts here and those in <i>Hossain</i> leads us to the same resolution. In each case, the petitioner's attorney properly submitted an entry of appearance listing a valid name and address. <i>Hossain,</i> 381 F.3d at 31. In each case, the BIA left out a piece of identifying informationin <i>Hossain</i> the company name and in this case the firm namewhen sending a briefing schedule to the attorney. <i>Id.</i> In each case, the petitioner's attorney failed to receive the briefing schedule in time to file a brief. <i>Id.</i> Thus, <i>Hossain</i> would appear to control on these facts, and we remand for the BIA (1) to provide Aponte with an opportunity to file a renewed motion to reopen, and (2) to decide that motion in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p>However, this remand comes with a caveat. We note again that the affidavit presented by Aponte's attorney is barely sufficient to establish that the briefing schedule was not timely received. The affidavit's shortage of details seems to indicate that it is a product of either hasty work or intentional obfuscation, and its sparsity should certainly be addressed in the renewed motion to reopen. In particular, the issue of when counsel actually received the briefing schedule, if ever, stands out to us as requiring clarification, just as it did to the BIA. Indeed, if any attorney representing Aponte actually received the briefing schedule before the case was dismissed, then <i>Hossain</i> carries much less force here than it would if counsel never received the briefing schedule. <i>Cf.</i> 381 F.3d at 31 (stating that Hossain's attorney never received a briefing schedule). Whatever the new affidavit provides, the BIA still must apply the law to the record evidence before it and determine whether to reopen Aponte's appeal.</p>\n<p>We also call attention to the Supreme Court's statement in <i>Kucana</i> that \"[a] court decision reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford the alien substantive relief,\" but instead \"touches and concerns only the question whether the alien's claims have been accorded a reasonable hearing.\" <i>Kucana,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 837. Despite our conclusion that Aponte did not receive a reasonable hearing, she still has a very difficult path ahead of her in order to obtain any substantive relief. The record indicates that she has had great difficulty getting her record expunged in New York and suggests no other basis for relief from removal. Furthermore, even if the BIA does elect to reopen the appeal, the merits are for it to determine as long as it acts within the parameters established by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> law. Overall, Aponte's likelihood of succeeding on the merits might well be negligible. However, the BIA must at least cast a more critical eye on its mailing procedure here and make certain that Aponte receives the full benefit of the administrative process that Congress has elected to provide for her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The BIA abused its discretion by issuing an inadequately reasoned decision denying Aponte's motion to reopen. Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> the petition for review and <i>remand</i> to the BIA for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  INA § 212(a)(2)(A), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A), provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Except as provided in clause (ii), any alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(II) a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), is inadmissible.</p>\n<p>[2]  8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2) provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Summary dismissal of appeals</p>\n<p>(i) Standards. A single Board member or panel may summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in any case in which:</p>\n<p>(A) The party concerned fails to specify the reasons for the appeal on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 (Notices of Appeal) or other document filed therewith; [or]</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(E) The party concerned indicates on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing[.]</p>\n<p>[3]  The affidavit makes reference to a decision dated September 16, 2008; however, no such decision exists. It is clear from context, however, and the parties do not dispute, that the decision being referenced is the BIA's November 18, 2008 decision.</p>\n<p>[4]  The government suggests that the BIA's inclusion of a suite number as part of the address serves as evidence that the briefing schedule was received. However, it appears that the BIA did not actually consider the suite number in rendering its decision. Because our review is limited to \"the basis articulated in the decision,\" and we \"may not assume that the Board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion,\" <i>Daneshvar,</i> 355 F.3d at 626, we will not address the suite number further save to note that the BIA may consider it as circumstantial evidence on remand.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although <i>Hossain</i> concerns a motion for reconsideration, while this case concerns a motion to reopen, both types of motions are appropriate means of addressing a petitioner's failure to file a timely brief. However, a motion to reopen is more appropriate where, as here, new evidence is presentedin this case, the affidavit of Aponte's counsel. <i>See </i><i>Arias-Valencia v.
