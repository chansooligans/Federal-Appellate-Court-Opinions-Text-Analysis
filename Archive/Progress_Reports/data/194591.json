Alvarez and  Diana Matos, common\n\nlaw  husband and  wife,  were convicted  by  a jury  in  the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico for aiding and abetting several drug\n\noffenses.1    Miguel Flores,  though  not  a party  to  this\n\nappeal nor  convicted in the  same trial,  played a  central\n\nrole in  the alleged cocaine trafficking  scheme and pleaded\n\nguilty  to  the  identical  charges.    Appellants  defended\n\nagainst  the  charges  alleging  that  they  were  unwitting\n\nparticipants  in  defendant   Flores'  cocaine   trafficking\n\nscheme.  Flores  offered testimony  to the same  end.   Each\n\nappellant advances numerous grounds for reversal.  \n\n       Appellant  Alvarez  appeals his  convictions alleging\n\nthat the  district court  (1) erroneously refused  to accept\n\ndefendant Flores' guilty plea prior to the trial  of Alvarez\n\nand Matos,  (2) improperly prohibited Flores from testifying\n\nthat  his testimony  exposed him  to criminal  penalties for\n\ncocaine trafficking, and (3)  errored in denying appellant's\n\n                    \n\n1 Alvarez  and Matos were  convicted for  the possession  of\ncocaine  with intent to distribute in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n   2 and 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1); the  importation of cocaine\ninto the customs territory of the United States in violation\nof 18 U.S.C.    2 and 21 U.S.C.   952(a); and the failure to\ndeclare  cocaine in the cargo manifest or supply list of the\naircraft which  brought them  into the customs  territory of\nthe  United States  in violation  of 18  U.S.C.    2 and  21\nU.S.C.   955.  \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.  We affirm with respect to\n\nAlvarez.\n\n       Appellant Matos  joins the arguments  of Alvarez  and\n\nfurther appeals her convictions,  alleging that the district\n\ncourt  failed  to  exclude  government   evidence  that  was\n\nproduced in violation of Rule 16, Federal Rules  of Criminal\n\nProcedure.   As  to  Matos, we  reverse  and remand  to  the\n\ndistrict court for a new trial.\n\nI.     Evidence\n               \n\n       We recite  the evidence in  the light most  favorable\n\nto the  prosecution.   United States  v. Campbell,  874 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n838,  839  (1st Cir.  1989).   The  evidence showed  that on\n\nDecember 8, 1989, Victor M. Alvarez, Diana Matos, and Miguel\n\nA.  Flores arrived  at  the Luis  Munoz Marin  International\n\nAirport, San Juan, Puerto  Rico, on American Airlines flight\n\n904  from Caracas,  Venezuela.   A  U.S. Customs  Inspector,\n\nFrancis Aponte, noticed that  the three individuals appeared\n\nto be nervous and were talking secretively among themselves.\n\nInspector  Aponte approached  the individuals,  made routine\n\ninquiries of them,  and referred the group  to the secondary\n\ninspection station (a table used to examine the contents  of\n\na passenger's luggage).  At that time, appellant Alvarez was\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\npermitted   to  leave  the  customs  enclosure  to  purchase\n\nairplane tickets to New  York for each member of  the group.\n\nInspector Aponte testified on  cross-examination that he had\n\nnot  made  any  written  record of  the  group's  suspicious\n\nbehavior  even though  such information  would have  been an\n\nimportant part of the case report. \n\n       Carlos  Ortiz,   also  a   U.S.  Customs   Inspector,\n\ntestified  that he noticed two individuals, later identified\n\nas Flores and  Matos, pushing two carts stacked with luggage\n\nand  that  he motioned  for them  to approach  his secondary\n\nstation.    Inspector  Ortiz requested  Matos'  and  Flores'\n\ncustoms declaration cards,  noting that both cards  appeared\n\nto  have  been  filled  out  by  the  same  person.    Matos\n\ncomplained that  the airline had  broken a bottle  of liquor\n\nthat she packed in  her suitcase.  During his search  of the\n\nluggage, Ortiz noticed that the luggage contained both men's\n\nand women's  clothing and  he discovered a  heavy, newspaper\n\nwrapped  package.   Ortiz unwrapped  the package to  find an\n\naged  painting of  a young  girl in a  wooden frame.   Ortiz\n\nasked Matos if she had purchased the picture on her trip, to\n\nwhich she answered \"yes.\"  \n\n       Inspector Ortiz  consulted with  a senior  inspector,\n\ntook  the picture  to a  search room,  and drilled  into the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\npicture frame using a  small drill bit.  Ortiz  discovered a\n\nwhite  powdery substance  inside the  wooden frame,  which a\n\nfield test  indicated was  cocaine.   Matos and  Flores were\n\narrested  and searched.    Customs  inspectors then  located\n\nAlvarez in the airport's main concourse and placed him under\n\narrest.    Inspectors conducted  a  thorough  search of  the\n\ngroup's  luggage,  finding  two  additional  paintings  that\n\nconcealed cocaine  and discovering false bottoms  in each of\n\nthe  six suitcases  that  also concealed  cocaine.   Customs\n\nagents  determined  that the  group  carried  more than  ten\n\nkilograms of cocaine.\n\n        A grand  jury returned a  three count indictment  on\n\nJanuary 3,  1990, against Matos, Alvarez, and  Flores.  Each\n\ndefendant pleaded  not guilty.   On October 2,  1990, Flores\n\nfiled  a  notice  to  plead  guilty  on  one  count  of  the\n\nindictment.   It appears,  however, that Flores  intended to\n\nplead guilty on all three counts, and on October 5, 1990, he\n\namended his petition accordingly.   On October 5, 1990,  the\n\ndistrict   court   extensively   questioned  Flores   before\n\ndeclining  to accept his plea.  Flores asserted that Alvarez\n\nand Matos had been unaware of any plan to import cocaine and\n\nthat he, himself, was solely responsible for the crime.  The\n\njudge  suspended  the  proceeding  because  she  was  unsure\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nwhether Flores could plead  guilty to aiding and  abetting a\n\ncrime while  simultaneously proclaiming the innocence of the\n\nother alleged participants.\n\n       On October 9, 1990, the Flores plea hearing  resumed.\n\nThe judge explained that  Flores' refusal to acknowledge the\n\naiding  and abetting  modality did  not preclude  his guilty\n\nplea.   The court then engaged in an extensive colloquy with\n\ndefendant Flores in accordance  with Rule 11 of the  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P.   The judge  noted that Flores  had proclaimed  the\n\ninnocence of Alvarez and Matos in a confidential letter that\n\nFlores had  written  to  the  judge  from  prison.    Flores\n\nconfirmed sending the  letter and explained that  appellants\n\nwere friends  of his  from  New York,  the home  of all  the\n\nparties.  Flores  had invited  appellants to join  him on  a\n\ncruise from San Juan to several caribbean islands, including\n\na stop in Caracas,  Venezuela.  While on the  cruise, Flores\n\nmet  a man who offered  him three thousand  dollars to bring\n\nseveral  pictures from  Venezuela  to Puerto  Rico.   Flores\n\nagreed to  meet the man at  a hotel in Caracas  and to carry\n\nthe pictures into Puerto Rico as a passenger on a commercial\n\nairline.   Flores  did  not tell  Alvarez  or Matos  of  his\n\nscheme.  \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n       Flores, Alvarez,  and Matos  left the  ship while  it\n\nwas in  port in Caracas to visit  the beach.  Flores claimed\n\nto  have  tricked the  appellants  into  missing the  ship's\n\nscheduled departure because he did not want to fly to Puerto\n\nRico alone.  After missing the ship, Flores took Alvarez and\n\nMatos to the predesignated hotel, checked the group into two\n\nrooms, secretly picked up the pictures, and borrowed several\n\npieces  of luggage from  the man  after explaining  that the\n\ngroup  had left  their  bags on  the  cruise ship.    Flores\n\narranged to meet the man in Puerto Rico at which time Flores\n\nwould deliver the pictures  and return the borrowed luggage.\n\nFlores  claimed that he never  saw the cocaine  or even knew\n\nfor certain  that he  was carrying cocaine,2  but \"imagined\"\n\nthat the  frames concealed cocaine because  \"nobody is going\n\nto pay you  three thousand  dollars just to  bring in  three\n\npictures.\"   Flores  also denied  knowing that  the borrowed\n\nsuitcases concealed cocaine.  Flores explained that Alvarez,\n\nMatos, and  he purchased  new cloths  in  Caracas and  spent\n\nseveral days in the  hotel before returning to  Puerto Rico.\n\nFlores  packed  the  three  pictures in  separate  bags  and\n\n                    \n\n2 Flores explained to the  judge, \"At no time did  [the man]\ntell me  it was cocaine.   He told  me, `I want  you to take\nthese pictures  for me.   Take  them there.'   He  says, `it\ndoesn't contain anything dangerous.'\"\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\ncovered them with cloths.  Flores maintained that appellants\n\nwere totally  unaware of  his trafficking scheme  during the\n\nentire trip.\n\n       The district court declined Flores' plea, stating: \n\n       Now, you have stated that you  did not know what  was\n       in the picture frames, you did  not know what was  in\n       any of the luggage that you  carried.  That in itself\n       carries with it a defense  that you could  present to\n       the jury.   So I am  not convinced that you have made\n       a  plea of  guilty that  I  could  accept that  has a\n       basis  in fact  that  contains all  elements  of  the\n       offenses  charged  which  is a  requirement  for  the\n       court  to accept your  plea of  guilty.   Among those\n       elements, those of knowledge and intent.\n\nFlores  then moved  to  sever his  trial  from that  of  the\n\nappellants.  Finding that it would be impossible to mount an\n\nadequate defense if Flores testified in favor of Alvarez and\n\nMatos, the district court  granted both the motion to  sever\n\nFlores'  trial  and  Flores'   request  to  be  tried  after\n\nappellants.\n\n       At  trial,  Matos called  Flores  as  a  witness  who\n\noffered essentially the same testimony as given to the judge\n\nduring his  attempted plea.  During  examination by Alvarez,\n\nFlores was permitted to testify that it was a crime to bring\n\ncocaine  into the United States, but he was not permitted to\n\ntestify as to the  punishment that could be imposed  for his\n\ncrime or as  to his  aborted plea attempt.   The jury  found\n\nMatos and Alvarez guilty on all charges.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n       One  week  later,  Flores   again  came  before   the\n\ndistrict  court to offer his  guilty plea, but  this time he\n\nadmitted  that  he knew  cocaine  was  concealed within  the\n\npicture frames.  The court accepted his plea.\n\nII.    Alvarez's Conviction\n                           \n\n       Appellant  Alvarez  attacks  his conviction  on three\n\nfronts.    First,  Alvarez  alleges  that  his  defense  was\n\nprejudiced because the district  court erroneously failed to\n\naccept defendant Flores'  guilty plea prior to the  trial of\n\nAlvarez  and Matos.    Alvarez claims  the  judge relied  on\n\n\"perceived technical deficiencies\" with Flores' plea, rather\n\nthan  crediting   the  weight  of   Flores'  testimony  that\n\nindicated he  accepted full  responsibility  for the  crime.\n\nThis error, Alvarez argues,  prejudiced his defense  because\n\nhe  was deprived of  the opportunity  to put  Flores' guilty\n\nplea before the jury  as persuasive evidence of Mr.  Flores'\n\ncredibility and sincerity.  \n\n       We  are  unpersuaded  by  appellant's  argument.    A\n\ncriminal  defendant has  no  constitutional right  to  plead\n\nguilty.   North  Carolina v.  Alford, 400  U.S. 25,  38 n.11\n                                    \n\n(1970)   (a   trial   judge    need   not   \"accept    every\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nconstitutionally   valid  guilty   plea  merely   because  a\n\ndefendant wishes so  to plead\").   Nor does Rule  11 of  the\n\nFederal  Rules of  Criminal Procedure  create such  a right.\n\nUnited States  v. Bednarski, 445 F.2d 364,  365-66 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1971).    Here, the  district  court  conducted a  prolonged\n\nhearing  to determine  the sufficiency  of Flores'  plea and\n\ncarefully  considered his  testimony.   While  Alvarez might\n\nreach  a  different  conclusion  than the  judge  as  to the\n\nfactual sufficiency  of Flores'  attempted plea, we  find no\n\nerror in district court's determination.  \n\n       Second,  Alvarez  alleges  that  the  district  court\n\nviolated both the  Compulsory Process and the  Confrontation\n\nClauses of  the Sixth  Amendment by improperly  limiting the\n\nscope  of  Flores'  testimony  and,  thereby,  depriving the\n\ndefendants of  forceful evidence  of  Flores' sincerity  and\n\ncredibility.   On  direct examination,  Matos  asked Flores,\n\n\"You  have testified  under  oath  regarding the  exceptance\n\n[sic]  of  a  criminal  offense.    Are  you  aware  of  the\n\npunishment that could be imposed for this crime?\"\n\n       The   district   court  sustained   the  government's\n\nobjection  to the  question, reasoning  that Flores  had not\n\nactually  pleaded guilty and that  he might or  might not be\n\nfound guilty at a later  trial.  Moreover, Flores' testimony\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nwould not necessarily be  admissible against him in  his own\n\ntrial unless he  chose to testify  in his own defense.   The\n\njudge  did, however,  allow Matos  to ask  Flores if  he had\n\npreviously asserted the appellants' innocence.  \n\n       Alvarez  then  conducted  what he  termed  a  \"cross-\n\nexamination\" of Flores -- a characterization rejected by the\n\ntrial court.   The government argued that even though Flores\n\nwas not a joint witness of the appellants, cross-examination\n\nwas  unavailable because  Flores was  clearly  testifying in\n\nAlvarez's favor.  Though  we are inclined to agree  with the\n\ntrial  court, we need not decide the issue because Alvarez's\n\nSixth  Amendment  objection  fails  regardless  of  how  the\n\nexamination  is  characterized.    Flores  was permitted  to\n\ntestify on \"cross-examination\"  that he knew it  was a crime\n\nto  bring cocaine  into the  United States  and that  he had\n\n\"wanted to talk about [his story] for some time.\"\n\n        The  Confrontation  Clause  of  the Sixth  Amendment\n\nprovides that  \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,  the accused\n\nshall  enjoy the  right  . .  .  to be  confronted  with the\n\nwitnesses  against  him.\"    Cross-examination,  the primary\n\ninterest  secured  by  the  Confrontation  Clause,  is  \"the\n\nprincipal means by which the believability of a witness  and\n\nthe  truth  of  his  testimony are  tested.\"    Kentucky  v.\n                                                            \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nStincer, 482 U.S. 730, 736 (1987)  (quoting Davis v. Alaska,\n                                                           \n\n415  U.S.  308,  316  (1974)).    The  Confrontation  Clause\n\n\"mandates  a `minimum  threshold of  inquiry' be  afforded a\n\ndefendant  in the  cross-examination of  adverse witnesses,\"\n\nBrown  v. Powell,  975 F.2d  1, 5  (1st Cir.  1992) (quoting\n                \n\nUnited States  v.  Jarabek,  726  F.2d 889,  902  (1st  Cir.\n                          \n\n1984)), cert. dismissed, 122  L. Ed. 2d 179 (1993),  but the\n                       \n\nright  to  cross-examination is,  of  course, not  absolute.\n\nTrial judges  retain broad  discretion to impose  reasonable\n\nlimits on the scope  of cross-examination.  Delaware  v. Van\n                                                            \n\nArsdall, 475  U.S. 673, 679 (1986).  On appeal, we review to\n       \n\ndetermine:\n\n       whether  the jury  had  sufficient  other information\n       before it, without  the excluded evidence, to make  a\n       discriminating appraisal  of the  possible biases and\n       motivations of the witnesses.\n\nBrown, 975 F.2d at  5 (quoting United States v.  Tracey, 675\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 433, 437 (1st Cir.  1982)).  The issue here  is whether\n\nthe  district court  abused its  discretion and  committed a\n\nreversible error when it prevented the jury from learning of\n\nthe  exact penalties that Flores would  face if convicted of\n\ncocaine  trafficking.   We conclude  the court  committed no\n\nerror.\n\n       Flores was  allowed to  put his  entire story  before\n\nthe jury, including important information that supported his\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\ncredibility.   The jury heard Flores  testify that importing\n\ncocaine into the U.S. is a crime.  We are confident that the\n\njury knew that  a conviction for importing  a large quantity\n\nof cocaine carries  a serious punishment.   Though the  jury\n\ndid  not  learn of  the  precise  penalty imposed  for  drug\n\ntrafficking or  that Flores  had attempted to  plead guilty,\n\nthe  decision  to  exclude  this  evidence  was  within  the\n\ndistrict court's  discretion.    The  judge  could  properly\n\nconclude that  such testimony  might mislead or  confuse the\n\njury;  particularly where,  as here,  the witness  sought to\n\ntestify to the same penalties faced by the defendants.  \n\n       We   note  that  Sixth   Amendment  right  of  cross-\n\nexamination  is  directed  at  uncovering  witness bias  and\n\nuntruthfulness.   In this  case, however, Alvarez  sought to\n\nuse \"cross-examination\" to bolster the witness' credibility.\n\nContrary to  appellant's assertion, exposing a witness' bias\n\nto lie  can,  indeed, be  more  important than  exploring  a\n\nwitness' motivation  for telling  the truth.    Cf. Fed.  R.\n                                                   \n\nEvid. 608 (evidence of truthful character is admissible only\n\nafter the character of the witness for truthfulness has been\n\nattacked);  Fed. R.  Evid  801 (prior  consistent statements\n\ngenerally  admissible only  to rebut  an express  or implied\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\ncharge  of  recent  fabrication  or  improper  influence  or\n\nmotivation).\n\n       Alvarez  also   asserts  that   the  district   court\n\nviolated  the   Compulsory  Process  Clause  of   the  Sixth\n\nAmendment.    According  to  Alvarez,   the  district  court\n\ninterfered   with  his   constitutional  right   to  present\n\nwitnesses  in his own defense  when it excluded an important\n\nportion  of  Flores'  testimony  that weighed  in  favor  of\n\nFlores'   credibility.     The  Compulsory   Process  Clause\n\nguarantees every criminal defendant \"the right . . . to have\n\ncompulsory  process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . .\n\n.\"    This  fundamental  right, however,  is  not  absolute.\n\nCampbell, 874 F.2d at 851; Chappee v. Vose, 843 F.2d  25, 28\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir. 1988).   The  Supreme Court  has explained,  \"The\n\nSixth  Amendment  does  not  confer  the  right  to  present\n\ntestimony   free  from   the  legitimate   demands   of  the\n\nadversarial system . . .\"  United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n225, 241 (1975).  As explained more fully above, we conclude\n\nthat  the district  court  acted properly  to limit  Flores'\n\ntestimony which might have mislead or confused the jury. \n\n       Third,  Alvarez  complains that  the  district  court\n\nerrored  in denying  his  Rule  29  motion for  judgment  of\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nacquittal.3    Alvarez   contends  that  the   evidence  was\n\ninsufficient  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was\n\nan active participant in  the scheme to import cocaine.   We\n\nreview the  evidence to determine whether the  evidence as a\n\nwhole, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n\ntogether with  all  reasonable inferences  favorable to  it,\n\nwould  allow a  rational fact  finder to  conclude  beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt  that the defendant was  guilty as charged.\n\nUnited  States v.  Maraj,  947 F.2d  520,  522-23 (1st  Cir.\n                        \n\n1991); United States  v. Vargas, 945  F.2d 426, 427-28  (1st\n                               \n\nCir.  1991).   A conviction may  be grounded in  whole or in\n\npart on  circumstantial evidence.   Maraj, 947 F.2d  at 523.\n                                         \n\nMoreover,  because   the   jury  is   entrusted   with   the\n\nresponsibility for making credibility determinations  and is\n\nempowered  to accept  or  reject, in  whole  or in  part,  a\n\nwitness' testimony, we will not weigh witness credibility on\n\nappeal.

Neither mere association with the principal nor mere\n\npresence  at the scene of  a crime, even  when combined with\n\nknowledge that a crime was to be committed, is sufficient to\n\nestablish aiding  and abetting liability.   United States v.\n                                                            \n\nAponte-Suarez, 905 F.2d 483,  491 (1st Cir.) (quoting United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Francomano, 554  F.2d 483, 486  (1st Cir. 1977)),\n                     \n\ncert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 531 (1990).   Guided    by    these\n            \n\nstandards  of  review,  we  are  persuaded   that  Alvarez's\n\nconviction  is supported  by  sufficient evidence  of guilt.\n\nThere is  no  dispute  that  Alvarez was  traveling  for  an\n\nextended period of  time with  Matos and Flores  and that  a\n\nvery large quantity of cocaine was concealed  in the luggage\n\ncarried  by  the  group.    Moreover,  there  is  sufficient\n\nevidence upon which a  reasonable jury could conclude beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Alvarez participated in or sought to\n\nassist Flores' scheme to import cocaine into the U.S.\n\n       The  evidence established  that  a  Customs Inspector\n\nnoticed the group talking \"secretively\" at the airport; that\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ntwo of the  bags that  concealed cocaine  carried name  tags\n\nbearing  Alvarez's name; and that Alvarez and his common law\n\nwife  had  no means  of  support  other than  welfare,  food\n\nstamps,  and odd jobs and,  yet, they could  still afford to\n\nfly  to Puerto  Rico, travel  on  a cruise  ship, stay  in a\n\nVenezuelan hotel  for several days, and  purchase new cloths\n\nto  replace those purportedly left  on the cruise  ship.  In\n\naddition, the  government  was  able  to  highlight  certain\n\ninconsistencies  in the  testimony  offered  by  Flores  and\n\nMatos.4    Most  significantly, the  government  produced  a\n\nphotograph apparently  taken on the cruise  ship that showed\n\nMatos wearing  a striped dress  that according to  her story\n\nwas not purchased until after she disembarked from the  ship\n                             \n\nin  Caracas.    Matos  explained  that  she  was  apparently\n\nmistaken about  the items of  clothing she carried  with her\n\nwhen  she left  the ship.   The  government  also introduced\n\nevidence that the cruise  ship operators searched the cabins\n\nused  by Matos,  Alvarez, and  Flores and  did not  find the\n\nluggage  purportedly left  behind  by the  appellants.   The\n\nwitness, however, did not conduct the search himself and had\n\nno knowledge of how the search was conducted.\n\n                    \n\n4 Alvarez did not testify at trial.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n       Though  the   evidence   against   Alvarez   is   not\n\noverwhelming, when it is viewed in a light most favorable to\n\nthe  prosecution it  is sufficient  to support  the verdict.\n\nWe, therefore, affirm Alvarez's conviction.\n\nIII.   Matos' Conviction\n                        \n\n       In addition to  joining in the arguments advanced  by\n\nAlvarez, Matos contends that her conviction must be reversed\n\nbecause  the government  presented in  its  case-in-chief an\n\noral statement allegedly made  by Matos which the government\n\nfailed to disclose during pre-trial discovery as required by\n\nFed.  R. Crim. P. Rule 16.  Specifically, Matos challenges a\n\nportion of  the testimony  given  by Officer  Ortiz, a  U.S.\n\nCustoms  Inspector who  searched  Matos' luggage.    Officer\n\nOrtiz  testified that during the  search he asked   Matos if\n\nshe  had purchased  the picture  on her  trip, to  which she\n\nanswered  \"yes.\"   Ortiz's  testimony  was  the only  direct\n\nevidence that the incriminating picture belonged to Matos.  \n\n       The substance of Officer Ortiz's testimony came as  a\n\nsurprise to Matos because she had made two prior requests of\n\nthe  government -- first by  letter on January  11, 1990 and\n\nsecond by formal  motion on  January 22, 1990  -- to  comply\n\nwith  the  discovery  provisions  of Rule  16,  including  a\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nspecific request for any \"oral statement[s of the defendant]\n\nwhich the  Government intends  to offer in  evidence at  the\n\ntrial.\"  The government responded by expressly acknowledging\n\nits  obligations  under Rule  16  and  by producing  several\n\ndocuments.   The  government,  however, made  no mention  of\n\nMatos'  alleged statement at that time or at any time before\n\nthe damaging testimony  came before the jury.  During cross-\n\nexamination, Officer Ortiz admitted that his prior testimony\n\nat a preliminary  hearing and  before a grand  jury did  not\n\ninclude any reference to Matos' alleged statement concerning\n\nthe picture.\n\n       The  following morning, Matos moved to strike Officer\n\nOrtiz's  testimony and for the court to admonish the jury to\n\ndisregard  the testimony.    Matos argued  that  prosecution\n\nrecords showed that Officer Ortiz had told the government of\n\nMatos'  alleged  statement  in  April  1990,  but  that  the\n\ngovernment failed to produce  the statement despite repeated\n\nrequests by  Matos.   The judge  denied  the motion  without\n\ngiving an explanation.\n\n       Rule 16  imposes an obligation  on both the  criminal\n\ndefendant and the  government to produce or  disclose to the\n\nopposing party  certain relevant  evidence  prior to  trial.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nThe  provisions of Rule 16(a)(1)(A) in effect at the time of\n\ntrial provided, in relevant part:\n\n       Upon  request of  a defendant  the government\n       shall permit  the  defendant to  inspect  and\n       copy  .  .  .   the  substance  of  any  oral\n       statement  which  the  government intends  to\n       offer in  evidence at  the trial made  by the\n       defendant whether before  or after arrest  in\n       response to interrogation  by any person then\n       known  by the  defendant to  be a  government\n       agent.  \n\nFed.  R. Crim.  P. 16(a)(1)(A).   These  mandatory discovery\n\nprovisions  are  intended  to  contribute to  the  fair  and\n\nefficient  administration of  criminal justice  by providing\n\nthe defendant with sufficient information upon which to base\n\nan intelligent a plea;  by minimizing the undesirable effect\n\nof surprise at trial; and by contributing to the accuracy of\n\nthe fact finding  process.   Fed. R. Crim.  P. 16,  advisory\n                                                            \n\ncommittee's  note.  Where a party fails to comply with these\n                 \n\ndiscovery provisions, Rule 16 empowers the district court to\n\norder   the  party  to   comply  with  the   rule,  grant  a\n\ncontinuance,  exclude the  non-complying evidence,  or enter\n\nother  such relief as it  considers just.   Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n16(d)(2).  We review a district court's ruling on the effect\n\nof a failure to provide pretrial discovery only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   United  States v. Nickens,  955 F.2d  112, 126\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 113 S. Ct.  108 (1992); Rodriguez\n                                                            \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nCortes, 949 F.2d at 546; see Fed. R. Crim. P.  16(d)(2).  To\n                            \n\nsucceed  in obtaining a reversal on appeal, a defendant must\n\nprove both an  abuse of discretion and  prejudice.  Nickens,\n                                                           \n\n955 F.2d at  126; Rodriguez  Cortes, 949  F.2d at  546.   We\n                                   \n\nreverse.\n\n       We  believe the  trial  court erred  when  it  denied\n\nMatos'  motion to exclude the alleged statement or to hold a\n\nsuppression  hearing without  first making  a finding  as to\n\nwhether the  government acted in bad faith and whether Matos\n\nwas prejudiced by admission of the  statement.  We generally\n\ndefer  to the  judgment of  a district  judge who  is better\n\nsuited to  make factual  determinations based on  first hand\n\nobservation  of the  evidence.  In  this case,  however, the\n\njudge  failed to  make  even a  threshold  inquiry into  the\n\ncircumstances  leading to  nondisclosure  of the  statement.\n\nThe court  neither heard evidence nor  made factual findings\n\nconcerning the potential prejudice  flowing from a discovery\n\nviolation, the relative importance of Ortiz's testimony, and\n\nthe existence of prosecutorial bad faith.   See Nickens, 955\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 126.  This was error.\n\n       Moreover,  this  error  prejudiced  appellant  Matos.\n\nThe alleged Matos statement provided a critical link between\n\nMatos and  the effort to  smuggle the cocaine  laden picture\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\nframe into Puerto Rico.   To establish guilt for  aiding and\n\nabetting,  \"the  government  must prove  that  the defendant\n\nassociated himself  with the venture, participated  in it as\n\nin something he  wished to  bring about, and  sought by  his\n\nactions  to make it succeed.\"  Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n539 (quoting United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 217\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1989), cert.  denied, 493 U.S. 1030 (1990)).   The\n                              \n\nstatement attributed  to Matos was a  very significant piece\n\nof evidence  that indicated Matos  was a participant  in the\n\ncrime,  rather  than  merely  being  an  innocent  bystander\n\npresent at the  scene of  a crime.   Similarly, the  alleged\n\nstatement  fundamentally sabotaged  Matos' defense  that she\n\nwas an unwitting participant in Flores'  cocaine trafficking\n\nventure.    There  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that  the\n\nstatement  figured  prominently in  the  jury's decision  to\n\nreject  Flores'   account  of  the  incident,  which  wholly\n\nexculpated appellants.  \n\n       Given   the  central   importance  of   the   alleged\n\nstatement,  the  government's  failure  to  disclose  it  as\n\nrequired by  Rule 16  had additional grave  consequences for\n\nMatos.    First,  Matos   was  deprived  of  any  meaningful\n\nopportunity  to investigate the circumstances of her alleged\n\nstatement and to attempt to suppress it.  Significantly, the\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\ngovernment disclosed during  pretrial discovery a  statement\n\nmade  by  Alvarez,  which  Alvarez  successfully suppressed.\n\nSecond,  not knowing  of  the alleged  statement, Matos  was\n\ndeprived  of  the  opportunity   to  design  an  intelligent\n\nlitigation or  plea strategy  that responded to  the alleged\n\nstatement.  \n\n       The government  contends that  no prejudice  attached\n\nbecause \"it is doubtful that counsel for appellant would not\n\nanticipate  or  contemplate  that  such  a  statement  might\n\nexist.\"  Even  if this argument  were not inconsistent  with\n\nthe mandatory language of Rule 16, we would flatly reject it\n\nas  being  incompatible with  common  sense  and fundamental\n\nfairness.   The  government  also contends  that the  cross-\n\nexamination  of  Officer  Ortiz  effectively  impeached  his\n\ntestimony  and essentially  cured  whatever prejudice  might\n\nhave existed.  While  we have sometimes considered effective\n\ncross-examination   of   witness  when   weighing  potential\n\nprejudice presented by that witness' testimony, Nickens, 955\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 126; United  States v. Samalot Perez, 767  F.2d 1, 4\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir.  1985), those  cases  involved  the admission  of\n\ncumulative evidence that was regarded as harmless error.  In\n\nthis  case,   the  alleged   statement  was  vital   to  the\n\nconviction.\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n       Finally, the government argues  that since Matos  did\n\nnot  present the trial  judge with any  specific grounds for\n\nsuppressing  the  alleged   statement,  the  district  court\n\ncorrectly denied  Matos' request for a  suppression hearing.\n\nDuring  a  discussion   with  Matos'   counsel,  the   judge\n\nrepeatedly  asked  if  the  defendant  had  any  grounds  to\n\nsuppress the  statement.  Counsel responded  that he learned\n\nof  the  statement  only the  day  before,  that  he had  no\n\ninformation regarding the statement, and when pressed by the\n\njudge,  stated  that  at that  time  he  had  no grounds  to\n                                   \n\nsuppress  the statement other than the violation of Rule 16.\n\nWe are not surprised that Matos was unprepared to articulate\n\na particular  ground  for suppressing  the  statement  under\n\nthese circumstances and in the middle  of a trial.  The  one\n\npossible curative course, suspending the trial and holding a\n\nsuppresion hearing, was erroneously rejected by the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n       The  government is  wholly responsible  for  unfairly\n\nsurprising the defendant and should not benefit from its own\n\nviolation of Rule 16.\n\n       In summary, we  affirm the conviction of Alvarez  and\n\nreverse and remand for a new trial as to Matos.\n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n",

Alvarez and  Diana Matos, common\n\nlaw  husband and  wife,  were convicted  by  a jury  in  the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico for aiding and abetting several drug\n\noffenses.1    Miguel Flores,  though  not  a party  to  this\n\nappeal nor  convicted in the  same trial,  played a  central\n\nrole in  the alleged cocaine trafficking  scheme and pleaded\n\nguilty  to  the  identical  charges.    Appellants  defended\n\nagainst  the  charges  alleging  that  they  were  unwitting\n\nparticipants  in  defendant   Flores'  cocaine   trafficking\n\nscheme.  Flores  offered testimony  to the same  end.   Each\n\nappellant advances numerous grounds for reversal.  \n\n       Appellant  Alvarez  appeals his  convictions alleging\n\nthat the  district court  (1) erroneously refused  to accept\n\ndefendant Flores' guilty plea prior to the trial  of Alvarez\n\nand Matos,  (2) improperly prohibited Flores from testifying\n\nthat  his testimony  exposed him  to criminal  penalties for\n\ncocaine trafficking, and (3)  errored in denying appellant's\n\n                    \n\n1 Alvarez  and Matos were  convicted for  the possession  of\ncocaine  with intent to distribute in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n   2 and 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1); the  importation of cocaine\ninto the customs territory of the United States in violation\nof 18 U.S.C.    2 and 21 U.S.C.   952(a); and the failure to\ndeclare  cocaine in the cargo manifest or supply list of the\naircraft which  brought them  into the customs  territory of\nthe  United States  in violation  of 18  U.S.C.    2 and  21\nU.S.C.   955.  \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.  We affirm with respect to\n\nAlvarez.\n\n       Appellant Matos  joins the arguments  of Alvarez  and\n\nfurther appeals her convictions,  alleging that the district\n\ncourt  failed  to  exclude  government   evidence  that  was\n\nproduced in violation of Rule 16, Federal Rules  of Criminal\n\nProcedure.   As  to  Matos, we  reverse  and remand  to  the\n\ndistrict court for a new trial.\n\nI.     Evidence\n               \n\n       We recite  the evidence in  the light most  favorable\n\nto the  prosecution.   United States  v. Campbell,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523145\"><a href=\"/opinion/523145/united-states-v-andrews-bruce-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                 \n\n<span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  839  (1st Cir.  1989).   The  evidence showed  that on\n\nDecember 8, 1989, Victor M. Alvarez, Diana Matos, and Miguel\n\nA.  Flores arrived  at  the Luis  Munoz Marin  International\n\nAirport, San Juan, Puerto  Rico, on American Airlines flight\n\n904  from Caracas,  Venezuela.   A  U.S. Customs  Inspector,\n\nFrancis Aponte, noticed that  the three individuals appeared\n\nto be nervous and were talking secretively among themselves.\n\nInspector  Aponte approached  the individuals,  made routine\n\ninquiries of them,  and referred the group  to the secondary\n\ninspection station (a table used to examine the contents  of\n\na passenger's luggage).  At that time, appellant Alvarez was\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\npermitted   to  leave  the  customs  enclosure  to  purchase\n\nairplane tickets to New  York for each member of  the group.\n\nInspector Aponte testified on  cross-examination that he had\n\nnot  made  any  written  record of  the  group's  suspicious\n\nbehavior  even though  such information  would have  been an\n\nimportant part of the case report. \n\n       Carlos  Ortiz,   also  a   U.S.  Customs   Inspector,\n\ntestified  that he noticed two individuals, later identified\n\nas Flores and  Matos, pushing two carts stacked with luggage\n\nand  that  he motioned  for them  to approach  his secondary\n\nstation.    Inspector  Ortiz requested  Matos'  and  Flores'\n\ncustoms declaration cards,  noting that both cards  appeared\n\nto  have  been  filled  out  by  the  same  person.    Matos\n\ncomplained that  the airline had  broken a bottle  of liquor\n\nthat she packed in  her suitcase.  During his search  of the\n\nluggage, Ortiz noticed that the luggage contained both men's\n\nand women's  clothing and  he discovered a  heavy, newspaper\n\nwrapped  package.   Ortiz unwrapped  the package to  find an\n\naged  painting of  a young  girl in a  wooden frame.   Ortiz\n\nasked Matos if she had purchased the picture on her trip, to\n\nwhich she answered \"yes.\"  \n\n       Inspector Ortiz  consulted with  a senior  inspector,\n\ntook  the picture  to a  search room,  and drilled  into the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\npicture frame using a  small drill bit.  Ortiz  discovered a\n\nwhite  powdery substance  inside the  wooden frame,  which a\n\nfield test  indicated was  cocaine.   Matos and  Flores were\n\narrested  and searched.    Customs  inspectors then  located\n\nAlvarez in the airport's main concourse and placed him under\n\narrest.    Inspectors conducted  a  thorough  search of  the\n\ngroup's  luggage,  finding  two  additional  paintings  that\n\nconcealed cocaine  and discovering false bottoms  in each of\n\nthe  six suitcases  that  also concealed  cocaine.   Customs\n\nagents  determined  that the  group  carried  more than  ten\n\nkilograms of cocaine.\n\n        A grand  jury returned a  three count indictment  on\n\nJanuary 3,  1990, against Matos, Alvarez, and  Flores.  Each\n\ndefendant pleaded  not guilty.   On October 2,  1990, Flores\n\nfiled  a  notice  to  plead  guilty  on  one  count  of  the\n\nindictment.   It appears,  however, that Flores  intended to\n\nplead guilty on all three counts, and on October 5, 1990, he\n\namended his petition accordingly.   On October 5, 1990,  the\n\ndistrict   court   extensively   questioned  Flores   before\n\ndeclining  to accept his plea.  Flores asserted that Alvarez\n\nand Matos had been unaware of any plan to import cocaine and\n\nthat he, himself, was solely responsible for the crime.  The\n\njudge  suspended  the  proceeding  because  she  was  unsure\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nwhether Flores could plead  guilty to aiding and  abetting a\n\ncrime while  simultaneously proclaiming the innocence of the\n\nother alleged participants.\n\n       On October 9, 1990, the Flores plea hearing  resumed.\n\nThe judge explained that  Flores' refusal to acknowledge the\n\naiding  and abetting  modality did  not preclude  his guilty\n\nplea.   The court then engaged in an extensive colloquy with\n\ndefendant Flores in accordance  with Rule 11 of the  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P.   The judge  noted that Flores  had proclaimed  the\n\ninnocence of Alvarez and Matos in a confidential letter that\n\nFlores had  written  to  the  judge  from  prison.    Flores\n\nconfirmed sending the  letter and explained that  appellants\n\nwere friends  of his  from  New York,  the home  of all  the\n\nparties.  Flores  had invited  appellants to join  him on  a\n\ncruise from San Juan to several caribbean islands, including\n\na stop in Caracas,  Venezuela.  While on the  cruise, Flores\n\nmet  a man who offered  him three thousand  dollars to bring\n\nseveral  pictures from  Venezuela  to Puerto  Rico.   Flores\n\nagreed to  meet the man at  a hotel in Caracas  and to carry\n\nthe pictures into Puerto Rico as a passenger on a commercial\n\nairline.   Flores  did  not tell  Alvarez  or Matos  of  his\n\nscheme.  \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n       Flores, Alvarez,  and Matos  left the  ship while  it\n\nwas in  port in Caracas to visit  the beach.  Flores claimed\n\nto  have  tricked the  appellants  into  missing the  ship's\n\nscheduled departure because he did not want to fly to Puerto\n\nRico alone.  After missing the ship, Flores took Alvarez and\n\nMatos to the predesignated hotel, checked the group into two\n\nrooms, secretly picked up the pictures, and borrowed several\n\npieces  of luggage from  the man  after explaining  that the\n\ngroup  had left  their  bags on  the  cruise ship.    Flores\n\narranged to meet the man in Puerto Rico at which time Flores\n\nwould deliver the pictures  and return the borrowed luggage.\n\nFlores  claimed that he never  saw the cocaine  or even knew\n\nfor certain  that he  was carrying cocaine,2  but \"imagined\"\n\nthat the  frames concealed cocaine because  \"nobody is going\n\nto pay you  three thousand  dollars just to  bring in  three\n\npictures.\"   Flores  also denied  knowing that  the borrowed\n\nsuitcases concealed cocaine.  Flores explained that Alvarez,\n\nMatos, and  he purchased  new cloths  in  Caracas and  spent\n\nseveral days in the  hotel before returning to  Puerto Rico.\n\nFlores  packed  the  three  pictures in  separate  bags  and\n\n                    \n\n2 Flores explained to the  judge, \"At no time did  [the man]\ntell me  it was cocaine.   He told  me, `I want  you to take\nthese pictures  for me.   Take  them there.'   He  says, `it\ndoesn't contain anything dangerous.'\"\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\ncovered them with cloths.  Flores maintained that appellants\n\nwere totally  unaware of  his trafficking scheme  during the\n\nentire trip.\n\n       The district court declined Flores' plea, stating: \n\n       Now, you have stated that you  did not know what  was\n       in the picture frames, you did  not know what was  in\n       any of the luggage that you  carried.  That in itself\n       carries with it a defense  that you could  present to\n       the jury.   So I am  not convinced that you have made\n       a  plea of  guilty that  I  could  accept that  has a\n       basis  in fact  that  contains all  elements  of  the\n       offenses  charged  which  is a  requirement  for  the\n       court  to accept your  plea of  guilty.   Among those\n       elements, those of knowledge and intent.\n\nFlores  then moved  to  sever his  trial  from that  of  the\n\nappellants.  Finding that it would be impossible to mount an\n\nadequate defense if Flores testified in favor of Alvarez and\n\nMatos, the district court  granted both the motion to  sever\n\nFlores'  trial  and  Flores'   request  to  be  tried  after\n\nappellants.\n\n       At  trial,  Matos called  Flores  as  a  witness  who\n\noffered essentially the same testimony as given to the judge\n\nduring his  attempted plea.  During  examination by Alvarez,\n\nFlores was permitted to testify that it was a crime to bring\n\ncocaine  into the United States, but he was not permitted to\n\ntestify as to the  punishment that could be imposed  for his\n\ncrime or as  to his  aborted plea attempt.   The jury  found\n\nMatos and Alvarez guilty on all charges.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n       One  week  later,  Flores   again  came  before   the\n\ndistrict  court to offer his  guilty plea, but  this time he\n\nadmitted  that  he knew  cocaine  was  concealed within  the\n\npicture frames.  The court accepted his plea.\n\nII.    Alvarez's Conviction\n                           \n\n       Appellant  Alvarez  attacks  his conviction  on three\n\nfronts.    First,  Alvarez  alleges  that  his  defense  was\n\nprejudiced because the district  court erroneously failed to\n\naccept defendant Flores'  guilty plea prior to the  trial of\n\nAlvarez  and Matos.    Alvarez claims  the  judge relied  on\n\n\"perceived technical deficiencies\" with Flores' plea, rather\n\nthan  crediting   the  weight  of   Flores'  testimony  that\n\nindicated he  accepted full  responsibility  for the  crime.\n\nThis error, Alvarez argues,  prejudiced his defense  because\n\nhe  was deprived of  the opportunity  to put  Flores' guilty\n\nplea before the jury  as persuasive evidence of Mr.  Flores'\n\ncredibility and sincerity.  \n\n       We  are  unpersuaded  by  appellant's  argument.    A\n\ncriminal  defendant has  no  constitutional right  to  plead\n\nguilty.   North  Carolina v.  Alford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108215\"><a href=\"/opinion/108215/north-carolina-v-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  38 n.11\n                                    \n\n(1970)   (a   trial   judge    need   not   \"accept    every\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nconstitutionally   valid  guilty   plea  merely   because  a\n\ndefendant wishes so  to plead\").   Nor does Rule  11 of  the\n\nFederal  Rules of  Criminal Procedure  create such  a right.\n\nUnited States  v. Bednarski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297777\"><a href=\"/opinion/297777/united-states-v-i-james-bednarski-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  365-66 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1971).    Here, the  district  court  conducted a  prolonged\n\nhearing  to determine  the sufficiency  of Flores'  plea and\n\ncarefully  considered his  testimony.   While  Alvarez might\n\nreach  a  different  conclusion  than the  judge  as  to the\n\nfactual sufficiency  of Flores'  attempted plea, we  find no\n\nerror in district court's determination.  \n\n       Second,  Alvarez  alleges  that  the  district  court\n\nviolated both the  Compulsory Process and the  Confrontation\n\nClauses of  the Sixth  Amendment by improperly  limiting the\n\nscope  of  Flores'  testimony  and,  thereby,  depriving the\n\ndefendants of  forceful evidence  of  Flores' sincerity  and\n\ncredibility.   On  direct examination,  Matos  asked Flores,\n\n\"You  have testified  under  oath  regarding the  exceptance\n\n[sic]  of  a  criminal  offense.    Are  you  aware  of  the\n\npunishment that could be imposed for this crime?\"\n\n       The   district   court  sustained   the  government's\n\nobjection  to the  question, reasoning  that Flores  had not\n\nactually  pleaded guilty and that  he might or  might not be\n\nfound guilty at a later  trial.  Moreover, Flores' testimony\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nwould not necessarily be  admissible against him in  his own\n\ntrial unless he  chose to testify  in his own defense.   The\n\njudge  did, however,  allow Matos  to ask  Flores if  he had\n\npreviously asserted the appellants' innocence.  \n\n       Alvarez  then  conducted  what he  termed  a  \"cross-\n\nexamination\" of Flores -- a characterization rejected by the\n\ntrial court.   The government argued that even though Flores\n\nwas not a joint witness of the appellants, cross-examination\n\nwas  unavailable because  Flores was  clearly  testifying in\n\nAlvarez's favor.  Though  we are inclined to agree  with the\n\ntrial  court, we need not decide the issue because Alvarez's\n\nSixth  Amendment  objection  fails  regardless  of  how  the\n\nexamination  is  characterized.    Flores  was permitted  to\n\ntestify on \"cross-examination\"  that he knew it  was a crime\n\nto  bring cocaine  into the  United States  and that  he had\n\n\"wanted to talk about [his story] for some time.\"\n\n        The  Confrontation  Clause  of  the Sixth  Amendment\n\nprovides that  \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,  the accused\n\nshall  enjoy the  right  . .  .  to be  confronted  with the\n\nwitnesses  against  him.\"    Cross-examination,  the primary\n\ninterest  secured  by  the  Confrontation  Clause,  is  \"the\n\nprincipal means by which the believability of a witness  and\n\nthe  truth  of  his  testimony are  tested.\"    Kentucky  v.\n                                                            \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nStincer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111928\"><a href=\"/opinion/111928/kentucky-v-stincer/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (1987)  (quoting Davis v.

The issue here  is whether\n\nthe  district court  abused its  discretion and  committed a\n\nreversible error when it prevented the jury from learning of\n\nthe  exact penalties that Flores would  face if convicted of\n\ncocaine  trafficking.   We conclude  the court  committed no\n\nerror.\n\n       Flores was  allowed to  put his  entire story  before\n\nthe jury, including important information that supported his\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\ncredibility.   The jury heard Flores  testify that importing\n\ncocaine into the U.S. is a crime.  We are confident that the\n\njury knew that  a conviction for importing  a large quantity\n\nof cocaine carries  a serious punishment.   Though the  jury\n\ndid  not  learn of  the  precise  penalty imposed  for  drug\n\ntrafficking or  that Flores  had attempted to  plead guilty,\n\nthe  decision  to  exclude  this  evidence  was  within  the\n\ndistrict court's  discretion.    The  judge  could  properly\n\nconclude that  such testimony  might mislead or  confuse the\n\njury;  particularly where,  as here,  the witness  sought to\n\ntestify to the same penalties faced by the defendants.  \n\n       We   note  that  Sixth   Amendment  right  of  cross-\n\nexamination  is  directed  at  uncovering  witness bias  and\n\nuntruthfulness.   In this  case, however, Alvarez  sought to\n\nuse \"cross-examination\" to bolster the witness' credibility.\n\nContrary to  appellant's assertion, exposing a witness' bias\n\nto lie  can,  indeed, be  more  important than  exploring  a\n\nwitness' motivation  for telling  the truth.    Cf. Fed.  R.\n                                                   \n\nEvid. 608 (evidence of truthful character is admissible only\n\nafter the character of the witness for truthfulness has been\n\nattacked);  Fed.

According  to  Alvarez,   the  district  court\n\ninterfered   with  his   constitutional  right   to  present\n\nwitnesses  in his own defense  when it excluded an important\n\nportion  of  Flores'  testimony  that weighed  in  favor  of\n\nFlores'   credibility.     The  Compulsory   Process  Clause\n\nguarantees every criminal defendant \"the right . . . to have\n\ncompulsory  process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . .\n\n.\"    This  fundamental  right, however,  is  not  absolute.\n\nCampbell, 874 F.2d at 851; Chappee v.

Guided    by    these\n            \n\nstandards  of  review,  we  are  persuaded   that  Alvarez's\n\nconviction  is supported  by  sufficient evidence  of guilt.\n\nThere is  no  dispute  that  Alvarez was  traveling  for  an\n\nextended period of  time with  Matos and Flores  and that  a\n\nvery large quantity of cocaine was concealed  in the luggage\n\ncarried  by  the  group.    Moreover,  there  is  sufficient\n\nevidence upon which a  reasonable jury could conclude beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Alvarez participated in or sought to\n\nassist Flores' scheme to import cocaine into the U.S.\n\n       The  evidence established  that  a  Customs Inspector\n\nnoticed the group talking \"secretively\" at the airport; that\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ntwo of the  bags that  concealed cocaine  carried name  tags\n\nbearing  Alvarez's name; and that Alvarez and his common law\n\nwife  had  no means  of  support  other than  welfare,  food\n\nstamps,  and odd jobs and,  yet, they could  still afford to\n\nfly  to Puerto  Rico, travel  on  a cruise  ship, stay  in a\n\nVenezuelan hotel  for several days, and  purchase new cloths\n\nto  replace those purportedly left  on the cruise  ship.  In\n\naddition, the  government  was  able  to  highlight  certain\n\ninconsistencies  in the  testimony  offered  by  Flores  and\n\nMatos.4    Most  significantly, the  government  produced  a\n\nphotograph apparently  taken on the cruise  ship that showed\n\nMatos wearing  a striped dress  that according to  her story\n\nwas not purchased until after she disembarked from the  ship\n                             \n\nin  Caracas.    Matos  explained  that  she  was  apparently\n\nmistaken about  the items of  clothing she carried  with her\n\nwhen  she left  the ship.   The  government  also introduced\n\nevidence that the cruise  ship operators searched the cabins\n\nused  by Matos,  Alvarez, and  Flores and  did not  find the\n\nluggage  purportedly left  behind  by the  appellants.   The\n\nwitness, however, did not conduct the search himself and had\n\nno knowledge of how the search was conducted.\n\n                    \n\n4 Alvarez did not testify at trial.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n       Though  the   evidence   against   Alvarez   is   not\n\noverwhelming, when it is viewed in a light most favorable to\n\nthe  prosecution it  is sufficient  to support  the verdict.\n\nWe, therefore, affirm Alvarez's conviction.\n\nIII.   Matos' Conviction\n                        \n\n       In addition to  joining in the arguments advanced  by\n\nAlvarez, Matos contends that her conviction must be reversed\n\nbecause  the government  presented in  its  case-in-chief an\n\noral statement allegedly made  by Matos which the government\n\nfailed to disclose during pre-trial discovery as required by\n\nFed.  R. Crim. P. Rule 16.  Specifically, Matos challenges a\n\nportion of  the testimony  given  by Officer  Ortiz, a  U.S.\n\nCustoms  Inspector who  searched  Matos' luggage.    Officer\n\nOrtiz  testified that during the  search he asked   Matos if\n\nshe  had purchased  the picture  on her  trip, to  which she\n\nanswered  \"yes.\"   Ortiz's  testimony  was  the only  direct\n\nevidence that the incriminating picture belonged to Matos.  \n\n       The substance of Officer Ortiz's testimony came as  a\n\nsurprise to Matos because she had made two prior requests of\n\nthe  government -- first by  letter on January  11, 1990 and\n\nsecond by formal  motion on  January 22, 1990  -- to  comply\n\nwith  the  discovery  provisions  of Rule  16,  including  a\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nspecific request for any \"oral statement[s of the defendant]\n\nwhich the  Government intends  to offer in  evidence at  the\n\ntrial.\"  The government responded by expressly acknowledging\n\nits  obligations  under Rule  16  and  by producing  several\n\ndocuments.   The  government,  however, made  no mention  of\n\nMatos'  alleged statement at that time or at any time before\n\nthe damaging testimony  came before the jury.  During cross-\n\nexamination, Officer Ortiz admitted that his prior testimony\n\nat a preliminary  hearing and  before a grand  jury did  not\n\ninclude any reference to Matos' alleged statement concerning\n\nthe picture.\n\n       The  following morning, Matos moved to strike Officer\n\nOrtiz's  testimony and for the court to admonish the jury to\n\ndisregard  the testimony.    Matos argued  that  prosecution\n\nrecords showed that Officer Ortiz had told the government of\n\nMatos'  alleged  statement  in  April  1990,  but  that  the\n\ngovernment failed to produce  the statement despite repeated\n\nrequests by  Matos.   The judge  denied  the motion  without\n\ngiving an explanation.\n\n       Rule 16  imposes an obligation  on both the  criminal\n\ndefendant and the  government to produce or  disclose to the\n\nopposing party  certain relevant  evidence  prior to  trial.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nThe  provisions of Rule 16(a)(1)(A) in effect at the time of\n\ntrial provided, in relevant part:\n\n       Upon  request of  a defendant  the government\n       shall permit  the  defendant to  inspect  and\n       copy  .  .  .   the  substance  of  any  oral\n       statement  which  the  government intends  to\n       offer in  evidence at  the trial made  by the\n       defendant whether before  or after arrest  in\n       response to interrogation  by any person then\n       known  by the  defendant to  be a  government\n       agent.  \n\nFed.  R. Crim.  P. 16(a)(1)(A).   These  mandatory discovery\n\nprovisions  are  intended  to  contribute to  the  fair  and\n\nefficient  administration of  criminal justice  by providing\n\nthe defendant with sufficient information upon which to base\n\nan intelligent a plea;  by minimizing the undesirable effect\n\nof surprise at trial; and by contributing to the accuracy of\n\nthe fact finding  process.

Where a party fails to comply with these\n                 \n\ndiscovery provisions, Rule 16 empowers the district court to\n\norder   the  party  to   comply  with  the   rule,  grant  a\n\ncontinuance,  exclude the  non-complying evidence,  or enter\n\nother  such relief as it  considers just.

See Nickens, 955\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 126.

The\n                              \n\nstatement attributed  to Matos was a  very significant piece\n\nof evidence  that indicated Matos  was a participant  in the\n\ncrime,  rather  than  merely  being  an  innocent  bystander\n\npresent at the  scene of  a crime.   Similarly, the  alleged\n\nstatement  fundamentally sabotaged  Matos' defense  that she\n\nwas an unwitting participant in Flores'  cocaine trafficking\n\nventure.    There  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that  the\n\nstatement  figured  prominently in  the  jury's decision  to\n\nreject  Flores'   account  of  the  incident,  which  wholly\n\nexculpated appellants.  \n\n       Given   the  central   importance  of   the   alleged\n\nstatement,  the  government's  failure  to  disclose  it  as\n\nrequired by  Rule 16  had additional grave  consequences for\n\nMatos.    First,  Matos   was  deprived  of  any  meaningful\n\nopportunity  to investigate the circumstances of her alleged\n\nstatement and to attempt to suppress it.  Significantly, the\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\ngovernment disclosed during  pretrial discovery a  statement\n\nmade  by  Alvarez,  which  Alvarez  successfully suppressed.\n\nSecond,  not knowing  of  the alleged  statement, Matos  was\n\ndeprived  of  the  opportunity   to  design  an  intelligent\n\nlitigation or  plea strategy  that responded to  the alleged\n\nstatement.  \n\n       The government  contends that  no prejudice  attached\n\nbecause \"it is doubtful that counsel for appellant would not\n\nanticipate  or  contemplate  that  such  a  statement  might\n\nexist.\"  Even  if this argument  were not inconsistent  with\n\nthe mandatory language of Rule 16, we would flatly reject it\n\nas  being  incompatible with  common  sense  and fundamental\n\nfairness.   The  government  also contends  that the  cross-\n\nexamination  of  Officer  Ortiz  effectively  impeached  his\n\ntestimony  and essentially  cured  whatever prejudice  might\n\nhave existed.  While  we have sometimes considered effective\n\ncross-examination   of   witness  when   weighing  potential\n\nprejudice presented by that witness' testimony, Nickens, 955\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 126; United  States v. Samalot Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454790\"><a href=\"/opinion/454790/united-states-v-carlos-a-samalot-perez-and-enrique-ramos-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir.  1985), those  cases  involved  the admission  of\n\ncumulative evidence that was regarded as harmless error.  In\n\nthis  case,   the  alleged   statement  was  vital   to  the\n\nconviction.\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n       Finally, the government argues  that since Matos  did\n\nnot  present the trial  judge with any  specific grounds for\n\nsuppressing  the  alleged   statement,  the  district  court\n\ncorrectly denied  Matos' request for a  suppression hearing.\n\nDuring  a  discussion   with  Matos'   counsel,  the   judge\n\nrepeatedly  asked  if  the  defendant  had  any  grounds  to\n\nsuppress the  statement.  Counsel responded  that he learned\n\nof  the  statement  only the  day  before,  that  he had  no\n\ninformation regarding the statement, and when pressed by the\n\njudge,  stated  that  at that  time  he  had  no grounds  to\n                                   \n\nsuppress  the statement other than the violation of Rule 16.\n\nWe are not surprised that Matos was unprepared to articulate\n\na particular  ground  for suppressing  the  statement  under\n\nthese circumstances and in the middle  of a trial.  The  one\n\npossible curative course, suspending the trial and holding a\n\nsuppresion hearing, was erroneously rejected by the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n       The  government is  wholly responsible  for  unfairly\n\nsurprising the defendant and should not benefit from its own\n\nviolation of Rule 16.\n\n       In summary, we  affirm the conviction of Alvarez  and\n\nreverse and remand for a new trial as to Matos.\n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n</pre>",
