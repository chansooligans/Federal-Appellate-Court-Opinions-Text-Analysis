In this  appeal, we  must\n                               \n\ndetermine whether defendant-appellee South Shore Bank (\"South\n\nShore\")  properly  refused plaintiff-appellant  Mueller Co.'s\n\n(\"Mueller\")  request for  payment under  a letter  of credit.\n\nBecause the  documents accompanying Mueller's request did not\n\ncomply  with the  requirements  of the  letter of  credit, we\n\naffirm  the district  court's  ruling that  the dishonor  was\n\nproper.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          George  A.  Caldwell  Company  (\"Caldwell\")  was  a\n\nfamily-owned gas  and water-works  supply company located  in\n\nStoughton, Massachusetts.1  Caldwell  purchased supplies on a\n\nregular basis  from Mueller, a supplier  in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nBy  early 1990, Caldwell could no longer meet its payments to\n\nMueller, and Mueller stopped shipping supplies.  \n\n          As  a   condition   to  Mueller's   resumption   of\n\nshipments,  Caldwell arranged  for  South Shore  to issue  an\n\nirrevocable  standby letter  of credit  in favor  of Mueller.\n\nThe  letter, dated  May  24,  1990,  and  in  the  amount  of\n\n$500,000, provided  that if Caldwell failed  to make payments\n\nfor  goods ordered  and  shipped  after  May 24,  1990,  then\n\nMueller  could  present a  sight  draft  to South  Shore  for\n\npayment.  The sight  draft was to be accompanied  by invoices\n\n                    \n\n1.  Caldwell is not a party to the controversy before us.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n\"clearly  evidencing  that   the  goods  described  in   said\n\ninvoice(s) represent goods ordered  and shipped after May 24,\n\n1990.\"2   By  its  terms,  the letter  of  credit  was to  be\n\ngoverned by the Uniform  Customs and Practice for Documentary\n\nCredits (1983 Version) (hereinafter \"UCP\").\n\n          With the assurance of the standby letter of credit,\n\nMueller resumed  shipments to Caldwell.   Again, Caldwell was\n\nunable to meet its payments.  Mueller notified South Shore in\n\nlate October that it planned to draw on the letter of credit,\n\nand sent South  Shore an  \"aged trial  balance\" which  listed\n\ninvoices that Mueller planned to present for payment.  \n\n                    \n\n2.  The letter of credit stated in relevant part:\n\n     [South Shore] hereby establish[es]  our irrevocable\n     letter  of credit in [Mueller's] favor available by\n     your  drafts  drawn  at  sight and  accompanied  by\n     documents specified below:\n\n     1.    A  statement  on the  letterhead  of  Mueller\n     Company, addressed  as per this  letter of  credit,\n     signed by  an individual or  individuals purporting\n     to be  authorized,  stating:    \"Payment  has  been\n     demanded   of  George  A.  Caldwell,  213  Turnpike\n     Street, Stoughton, Ma. 02072-0006, not received and\n     is still outstanding for more than 60 days from the\n     relative  invoice  date(s).    Our  demand  relates\n     solely to  goods ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n     1990.\"  \n\n     2.    Copy(ies)  of  invoice(s) issued  by  Mueller\n     Company   purporting   to   represent   the   above\n     transaction, marked \"unpaid\" and clearly evidencing\n     that  the   goods  described  in   said  invoice(s)\n     represent goods  ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n     1990.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On December  31, 1990,  the expiration date  of the\n\nletter  of credit, Mueller  presented a sight  draft to South\n\nShore  in  the   amount  of  $221,996.11.     The  draft  was\n\naccompanied by  163 invoices  purporting  to represent  goods\n\nordered  and shipped  after  May 24,  1990.   A  considerable\n\nnumber of the invoices, however, listed order dates  prior to\n\nMay 24, 1990.   South Shore sent  a timely letter to  Mueller\n\nrefusing  to  honor  the  draft  on  the   grounds  that  the\n\n\"[i]nvoices presented  do  not clearly  evidence  that  goods\n\ndescribed represent  goods ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n\n1990 as per . . . the letter of credit.\" \n\n          Mueller  thereafter  filed  a diversity  action  in\n\ndistrict   court,  alleging   that  South   Shore  wrongfully\n\ndishonored the  draft, arguing, inter alia,  that South Shore\n                                          \n\nknew or should have known that the invoices represented goods\n\nordered  and shipped  after May  24, 1990.   Upon  motion for\n\nsummary judgment by South Shore, the district court dismissed\n\nMueller's cause  of action on  the grounds that  the invoices\n\nsubmitted by Mueller  did not  comply with the  terms of  the\n\nletter of credit.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Dishonor of the Draft\n                         \n\n          Under  the provisions  of  the UCP,  \"[b]anks  must\n\nexamine all documents with  reasonable care to ascertain that\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nthey  appear, on  their face,  to be  in accordance  with the\n\nterms   and  conditions  of  the  credit.\"    UCP,  Art.  15.\n\nMoreover,   letters  of   credit   \"by  their   nature,   are\n\ntransactions separate from the  sales or other contract(s) on\n\nwhich they may  be based, and banks  are in no  way concerned\n\nwith or bound  by such contract(s).\"  UCP, Art.  3.

Westates Airlines,  Inc., 899\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1269, 1272  (1st Cir.  1990) (\"[C]ourts  have typically\n\nconsidered  the  letter of  credit  as  `independent' of  the\n\ncontract.\").     Thus,  in  determining   their  rights   and\n\nobligations  under  a  letter  of credit,  \"parties  are  not\n                                                             \n\nrequired to look beyond the face of the documents presented.\"\n\nAuto  Servicio  San  Ignacio,   S.R.L.  v.  Compania  Anonima\n                                                             \n\nVenezolana de Navegacion, 765 F.2d 1306, 1310 (5th Cir. 1985)\n                        \n\n(emphasis in original).  See also UCP, Art. 4 (\"[A]ll parties\n                                 \n\nconcerned deal  in documents,  not in goods,  services and/or\n\nother performances to which the documents may relate.\").  I n\n\nthis case, the letter of credit required that the sight draft\n\nbe  accompanied  by  invoices \"clearly  evidencing\"  that the\n\ngoods  were  \"ordered  and  shipped  after  May  24,  1990.\"3\n\n                    \n\n3.  Mueller argues  that the  qualifying term \"after  May 24,\n1990\"  applies  only  to  \"shipped,\" and  not  to  \"ordered.\"\nObviously, goods  would not be shipped  without being ordered\nat some date, and if the phrase were read as meaning that the\ndate  was of no  consequence, there would be  no point to the\nword  \"ordered\" being present at all.   Accordingly, we agree\nwith  the district court that  the term \"after  May 24, 1990\"\nunambiguously modifies both \"shipped\" and \"ordered.\"\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nSurely,  an invoice with an order  date prior to May 24, 1990\n                                             \n\ndoes  not \"clearly evidence\" an order placed after that date.\n\nRather, such an invoice directly contradicts the terms of the\n\nletter  of credit.4  In  contending that South  Shore knew or\n\nshould have known that  these invoices represented goods that\n\nhad been  reordered and shipped  subsequent to May  24, 1990,\n                   \n\nMueller is  essentially urging  that South Shore  should have\n\nlooked  beyond  the  face   of  invoices  to  the  underlying\n\ntransaction.   As  we have  stated, however, South  Shore was\n\nunder no such obligation.  See, e.g., Auto Servicio, 765 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 1310;  UCP, Art. 4.   Because the invoices failed  to meet\n\nthe  requirements  of the  letter  of  credit, we  find  that\n\ndishonor was proper.\n\nB.  Additional Arguments\n                        \n\n                    \n\n4.  We   disagree  with  Mueller's  characterization  of  the\nimproper  order dates as  \"technical inconsistencies.\"   See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Exotic Traders Far East Buying Office v. Exotic Trading\n                                                             \nU.S.A., Inc.,  717 F. Supp. 14,  17 (D. Mass. 1989).   Unlike\n            \nthe  documents in  Exotic  Traders which  the district  court\n                                  \nfound \"could not have misled anyone,\" id., the non-conforming\n                                         \norder dates in the  instant case signaled that the  goods had\nbeen ordered prior to May 24, 1990.  By its terms, the letter\n                  \nof credit did not bind South Shore to honor such invoices.\n     Moreover, we reject Mueller's  argument that South Shore\ncould or  should have relied  on the \"invoice\"  dates, rather\nthan the  \"order\" dates, in determining  whether the invoices\ncomplied  with the letter of  credit.  While  it appears that\nmost  or all of the invoices had  invoice dates after May 24,\n1990,  the  nonconforming  order  dates  were  sufficient  to\njustify dishonor.  See,  e.g., UCP, Art. 15  (\"Documents that\n                             \nappear, on  their face, to  be inconsistent with  one another\nwill  be considered as not appearing, on their face, to be in\naccordance with the terms of the letter of credit.\").\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Our  ruling  that  dishonor  was   proper,  as  the\n\ndistrict court properly pointed  out below, is dispositive of\n\nMueller's additional arguments. \n\n          We  reject Mueller's  contention that  the invoices\n\nwith  valid  order  dates  constituted  separate  or  partial\n\ndrawings on the letter of credit.  While the letter of credit\n\ndid allow partial  drawings, Mueller chose  to draw upon  the\n\nletter  of  credit  only  once  with  a  single  sight  draft\n\npresented on  the letter's expiration date.   Mueller directs\n\nus to no authority, nor have we located any, which stands for\n\nthe proposition that an issuing bank  must pay a portion of a\n                                                        \n\ndocumentary  sight draft  on  the grounds  that  some of  the\n                                                     \n\ndocuments comply.  Because the \"valid\" invoices presented did\n\nnot meet the  amount of  the sight draft,  the bank  properly\n\ndeclined to honor the entire draft.\n\n          Finally, we  find nothing in the  record to support\n\nMueller's contention that the  dishonor amounted to bad faith\n\nor an  unfair business practice.5 \n\n                    \n\n5.  In arguing that South Shore's dishonor  was in bad faith,\nMueller relies  almost exclusively on the  fact that Caldwell\nexpressed an  initial  willingness to  waive the  documentary\ndiscrepancies between the invoices  and the letter of credit.\nThis argument is based on  a misunderstanding of the doctrine\nof  waiver as it  applies to  letter of  credit transactions.\nWhile  Caldwell may waive its  own right to  insist on strict\n                                  \ncompliance, it  may not  waive South  Shore's  right in  this\nrespect.    See  e.g.,  Cooperative  Agricole  Groupement  de\n                                                             \nProducteurs Bovins de L'Ouest  v. Banesto Banking Corp., 1989\n                                                       \nWL  82454, *23 (S.D.N.Y. July  19, 1989) (\"Any  waiver by the\n[customer] merely  effects the contract between  the bank and\nthe  [customer].   Any  other  interpretation  of the  waiver\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          Because Mueller  has presented no  genuine issue as\n\nto  any material fact, the entry of summary judgment in favor\n\nof South Shore was proper as  a matter of law.   Accordingly,\n\nthe order of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\ndoctrine would emasculate the UCP requirements for amending a\nletter of  credit.\").    Accordingly,  we find  no  merit  in\nMueller's  argument  that  Caldwell's  willingness  to  waive\nindicates that South Shore proceeded in bad faith.  \n     Equally  unavailing  is  Mueller's   estoppel  argument.\nMueller's late October letter, which included the \"aged trial\nbalance,\" and  which stated that Mueller intended  to draw on\nthe letter  of credit, did  not include any  actual invoices.\nThus,  South  Shore's  failure   to  object  to  the  October\nnotification letter did not estop it from later rejecting the\ndraft due to nonconforming invoices.\n     To  the  extent that  Mueller  makes  other waiver,  bad\nfaith, or estoppel claims, we find them to be without merit.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

In this  appeal, we  must\n                               \n\ndetermine whether defendant-appellee South Shore Bank (\"South\n\nShore\")  properly  refused plaintiff-appellant  Mueller Co.'s\n\n(\"Mueller\")  request for  payment under  a letter  of credit.\n\nBecause the  documents accompanying Mueller's request did not\n\ncomply  with the  requirements  of the  letter of  credit, we\n\naffirm  the district  court's  ruling that  the dishonor  was\n\nproper.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          George  A.  Caldwell  Company  (\"Caldwell\")  was  a\n\nfamily-owned gas  and water-works  supply company located  in\n\nStoughton, Massachusetts.1  Caldwell  purchased supplies on a\n\nregular basis  from Mueller, a supplier  in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nBy  early 1990, Caldwell could no longer meet its payments to\n\nMueller, and Mueller stopped shipping supplies.  \n\n          As  a   condition   to  Mueller's   resumption   of\n\nshipments,  Caldwell arranged  for  South Shore  to issue  an\n\nirrevocable  standby letter  of credit  in favor  of Mueller.\n\nThe  letter, dated  May  24,  1990,  and  in  the  amount  of\n\n$500,000, provided  that if Caldwell failed  to make payments\n\nfor  goods ordered  and  shipped  after  May 24,  1990,  then\n\nMueller  could  present a  sight  draft  to South  Shore  for\n\npayment.  The sight  draft was to be accompanied  by invoices\n\n                    \n\n1.  Caldwell is not a party to the controversy before us.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n\"clearly  evidencing  that   the  goods  described  in   said\n\ninvoice(s) represent goods ordered  and shipped after May 24,\n\n1990.\"2   By  its  terms,  the letter  of  credit  was to  be\n\ngoverned by the Uniform  Customs and Practice for Documentary\n\nCredits (1983 Version) (hereinafter \"UCP\").\n\n          With the assurance of the standby letter of credit,\n\nMueller resumed  shipments to Caldwell.   Again, Caldwell was\n\nunable to meet its payments.  Mueller notified South Shore in\n\nlate October that it planned to draw on the letter of credit,\n\nand sent South  Shore an  \"aged trial  balance\" which  listed\n\ninvoices that Mueller planned to present for payment.  \n\n                    \n\n2.  The letter of credit stated in relevant part:\n\n     [South Shore] hereby establish[es]  our irrevocable\n     letter  of credit in [Mueller's] favor available by\n     your  drafts  drawn  at  sight and  accompanied  by\n     documents specified below:\n\n     1.    A  statement  on the  letterhead  of  Mueller\n     Company, addressed  as per this  letter of  credit,\n     signed by  an individual or  individuals purporting\n     to be  authorized,  stating:    \"Payment  has  been\n     demanded   of  George  A.  Caldwell,  213  Turnpike\n     Street, Stoughton, Ma. 02072-0006, not received and\n     is still outstanding for more than 60 days from the\n     relative  invoice  date(s).    Our  demand  relates\n     solely to  goods ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n     1990.\"  \n\n     2.    Copy(ies)  of  invoice(s) issued  by  Mueller\n     Company   purporting   to   represent   the   above\n     transaction, marked \"unpaid\" and clearly evidencing\n     that  the   goods  described  in   said  invoice(s)\n     represent goods  ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n     1990.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On December  31, 1990,  the expiration date  of the\n\nletter  of credit, Mueller  presented a sight  draft to South\n\nShore  in  the   amount  of  $221,996.11.     The  draft  was\n\naccompanied by  163 invoices  purporting  to represent  goods\n\nordered  and shipped  after  May 24,  1990.   A  considerable\n\nnumber of the invoices, however, listed order dates  prior to\n\nMay 24, 1990.   South Shore sent  a timely letter to  Mueller\n\nrefusing  to  honor  the  draft  on  the   grounds  that  the\n\n\"[i]nvoices presented  do  not clearly  evidence  that  goods\n\ndescribed represent  goods ordered and shipped  after May 24,\n\n1990 as per . . . the letter of credit.\" \n\n          Mueller  thereafter  filed  a diversity  action  in\n\ndistrict   court,  alleging   that  South   Shore  wrongfully\n\ndishonored the  draft, arguing, inter alia,  that South Shore\n                                          \n\nknew or should have known that the invoices represented goods\n\nordered  and shipped  after May  24, 1990.   Upon  motion for\n\nsummary judgment by South Shore, the district court dismissed\n\nMueller's cause  of action on  the grounds that  the invoices\n\nsubmitted by Mueller  did not  comply with the  terms of  the\n\nletter of credit.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.

See also UCP, Art. 4 (\"[A]ll parties\n                                 \n\nconcerned deal  in documents,  not in goods,  services and/or\n\nother performances to which the documents may relate.\").  I n\n\nthis case, the letter of credit required that the sight draft\n\nbe  accompanied  by  invoices \"clearly  evidencing\"  that the\n\ngoods  were  \"ordered  and  shipped  after  May  24,  1990.\"3\n\n                    \n\n3.  Mueller argues  that the  qualifying term \"after  May 24,\n1990\"  applies  only  to  \"shipped,\" and  not  to  \"ordered.\"\nObviously, goods  would not be shipped  without being ordered\nat some date, and if the phrase were read as meaning that the\ndate  was of no  consequence, there would be  no point to the\nword  \"ordered\" being present at all.   Accordingly, we agree\nwith  the district court that  the term \"after  May 24, 1990\"\nunambiguously modifies both \"shipped\" and \"ordered.\"\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nSurely,  an invoice with an order  date prior to May 24, 1990\n                                             \n\ndoes  not \"clearly evidence\" an order placed after that date.\n\nRather, such an invoice directly contradicts the terms of the\n\nletter  of credit.4  In  contending that South  Shore knew or\n\nshould have known that  these invoices represented goods that\n\nhad been  reordered and shipped  subsequent to May  24, 1990,\n                   \n\nMueller is  essentially urging  that South Shore  should have\n\nlooked  beyond  the  face   of  invoices  to  the  underlying\n\ntransaction.   As  we have  stated, however, South  Shore was\n\nunder no such obligation.  See, e.g., Auto Servicio, 765 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 1310;  UCP, Art. 4.   Because the invoices failed  to meet\n\nthe  requirements  of the  letter  of  credit, we  find  that\n\ndishonor was proper.\n\nB.  Additional Arguments\n                        \n\n                    \n\n4.  We   disagree  with  Mueller's  characterization  of  the\nimproper  order dates as  \"technical inconsistencies.\"   See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Exotic Traders Far East Buying Office v. Exotic Trading\n                                                             \nU.S.A., Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1584507\"><a href=\"/opinion/1584507/exotic-traders-far-east-buying-office-v-exotic-tr/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  17 (D. Mass. 1989).   Unlike\n            \nthe  documents in  Exotic  Traders which  the district  court\n                                  \nfound \"could not have misled anyone,\" id., the non-conforming\n                                         \norder dates in the  instant case signaled that the  goods had\nbeen ordered prior to May 24, 1990.  By its terms, the letter\n                  \nof credit did not bind South Shore to honor such invoices.\n     Moreover, we reject Mueller's  argument that South Shore\ncould or  should have relied  on the \"invoice\"  dates, rather\nthan the  \"order\" dates, in determining  whether the invoices\ncomplied  with the letter of  credit.  While  it appears that\nmost  or all of the invoices had  invoice dates after May 24,\n1990,  the  nonconforming  order  dates  were  sufficient  to\njustify dishonor.  See,  e.g., UCP, Art. 15  (\"Documents that\n                             \nappear, on  their face, to  be inconsistent with  one another\nwill  be considered as not appearing, on their face, to be in\naccordance with the terms of the letter of credit.\").\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Our  ruling  that  dishonor  was   proper,  as  the\n\ndistrict court properly pointed  out below, is dispositive of\n\nMueller's additional arguments. \n\n          We  reject Mueller's  contention that  the invoices\n\nwith  valid  order  dates  constituted  separate  or  partial\n\ndrawings on the letter of credit.  While the letter of credit\n\ndid allow partial  drawings, Mueller chose  to draw upon  the\n\nletter  of  credit  only  once  with  a  single  sight  draft\n\npresented on  the letter's expiration date.   Mueller directs\n\nus to no authority, nor have we located any, which stands for\n\nthe proposition that an issuing bank  must pay a portion of a\n                                                        \n\ndocumentary  sight draft  on  the grounds  that  some of  the\n                                                     \n\ndocuments comply.  Because the \"valid\" invoices presented did\n\nnot meet the  amount of  the sight draft,  the bank  properly\n\ndeclined to honor the entire draft.\n\n          Finally, we  find nothing in the  record to support\n\nMueller's contention that the  dishonor amounted to bad faith\n\nor an  unfair business practice.5 \n\n                    \n\n5.  In arguing that South Shore's dishonor  was in bad faith,\nMueller relies  almost exclusively on the  fact that Caldwell\nexpressed an  initial  willingness to  waive the  documentary\ndiscrepancies between the invoices  and the letter of credit.\nThis argument is based on  a misunderstanding of the doctrine\nof  waiver as it  applies to  letter of  credit transactions.\nWhile  Caldwell may waive its  own right to  insist on strict\n                                  \ncompliance, it  may not  waive South  Shore's  right in  this\nrespect.
