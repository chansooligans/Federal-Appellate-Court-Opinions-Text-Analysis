In 1947 he pleaded guilty in a state court in New York to a charge of second degree assault, and was sentenced as a second offender because of his prior conviction in Florida.

See Quicksall v. People of State of Michigan, 339 U.S. 660, 666, 70 S.Ct. 910, 94 L.Ed. 1188; United State ex rel. Turpin v.

Furthermore, it does not appear that the relator has exhausted his remedies in the Florida courts. In 1954 he petitioned the sentencing court to set aside its sentence, and it does not appear that he appealed from the denial of his petition, although he was informed by the Attorney General of Florida of his right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
