Plaintiff appeals  from a  district\n                    \n\ncourt decision affirming a final decision of the Secretary of\n\nHealth  and Human  Services that appellant  did not  meet the\n\ndisability  requirements  of  the  Social  Security  Act  for\n\npurposes of  obtaining disability  benefits.   We affirm  the\n\njudgment below.          Appellant's      application     for\n\ndisability benefits alleged an inability to work beginning at\n\nage  47, due  to asthma,  chest pain,  back pain,  high blood\n\npressure and a  nervous condition.  After a  hearing at which\n\nappellant  was represented by  counsel, an Administrative Law\n\nJudge (\"ALJ\")  found that appellant  suffered from  bronchial\n\nasthma  and allergic rhinopharyngitis.  The medical evidence,\n\nhowever,  did  not  indicate that  these  conditions  were as\n\nsevere  as appellant claimed,  and the ALJ  found appellant's\n\ntestimony on this  point \"not credible.\"   The ALJ  concluded\n\nthat  appellant was capable  of performing her  past relevant\n\nwork  as  a  photo supply  sales  clerk  or  customer service\n\nrepresentative.    The  Appeals  Council  affirmed  after   a\n\nseparate  review, modifying the  record to include  a finding\n\nthat evidence of appellant's  alleged mental impairment  also\n\nreflected a lack of the requisite severity, both alone and in\n\ncombination with her other medical conditions.  \n\n          In sum, the Secretary found that appellant was \"not\n\ndisabled\" at step  four of the familiar  regulatory five-step\n\nsequential analysis, in that she was able to perform her past\n\n                             -2-\n\nrelevant work.   See  20 C.F.R.    404.1520.   Appellant then\n                    \n\nappealed  to  the   district  court,  where  the   magistrate\n\nundertook  a  thorough  and detailed  review  of  the record,\n\nconcluding that there was substantial evidence to support the\n\nSecretary's  decision.    The  district  judge  accepted  the\n\nmagistrate's recommendation and entered judgment accordingly.\n\n          While  appellant  attempts   here  to  reargue  the\n\nsubstantial evidence issue on the basis of the entire record,\n\nin  the district  court  she  interposed  only  one  specific\n\nobjection  to the magistrate's  report.  She  argued that the\n\nALJ's finding that she could return to her past relevant work\n\nwas  error  because  the Secretary  had  not  produced expert\n\nvocational testimony  proving that  her work environment  was\n\n\"entirely free of irritants, pollutants and other potentially\n\ndamaging conditions.\"   Since appellant and her  counsel were\n\nnotified that a  failure to object would result  in waiver of\n\nany issue  not specifically raised, on appeal we need address\n\nonly   the  issue  properly  preserved.    United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nValencia-Copete, 792  F.2d 4  (1st Cir.  1986) (after  proper\n               \n\nnotice,  failure to file a specific objection to magistrate's\n\nreport will waive  the right to appeal); P.R.  Loc. R. 510.2;\n\nsee  also  Thomas v.  Arn,  474  U.S. 140  (1985)  (upholding\n                         \n\nconstitutionality of waiver rule). \n\n         Appellant's  objection  misperceives the  burden  of\n\nproof  at the preliminary  stages of the  sequential analytic\n\n                             -3-\n\nprocess, and assumes a conclusion about her condition that is\n\nnot supported by the  evidence.  \"It is  well settled that  a\n\nclaimant  seeking disability benefits  has the initial burden\n\nof proving that  her impairments prevent her  from performing\n\nher former type of work.\"  Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 371\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1985); see also Goodermote v. Secretary of HHS, 690\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 5,  7 (1st  Cir. 1982) (explaining  burdens at  steps of\n\nsequential  analytic  process).     The  burden  includes  an\n\nobligation  to  present evidence  relating to  the particular\n\ndemands of  the  job that  the  claimant alleges  she  cannot\n\nperform.  Dudley v. Secretary of HHS,  816 F.2d 792, 795 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1987).  \n\n          The  medical evidence  produced did  not  require a\n\nfinding that  appellant needed  a work  environment \"entirely\n\nfree\" of irritants.  The  evidence showed a history of asthma\n\ndating back  to 1986, but  with at  most only a  few sporadic\n\nepisodes that  might be  characterized as  severe.   Overall,\n\nappellant's  treating  allergist  reported  that  her  asthma\n\nattacks were  not frequent,  not severe, and  her lungs  were\n\nclear between episodes.   Pulmonary function studies  and the\n\nremainder  of the  medical evidence  were  consistent with  a\n\nconclusion that appellant suffered  only a mildly restrictive\n\nventilatory  impairment.     Appellant   had  no   exertional\n\nlimitations whatsoever according  to two residual  functional\n\ncapacity  assessments.  Although one of the assessments might\n\n                             -4-\n\nbe  construed as urging that appellant avoid any contact with\n\nextreme cold, wetness,  humidity or fumes, the  weight of the\n\nmedical evidence most strongly corroborated the conclusion in\n\nthe  second  assessment,  that  appellant  should  avoid only\n\n\"concentrated  exposure\"  to  these  irritants.    The  ALJ's\n\nevaluation of  appellant's testimonial  credibility, and  his\n\nresolution of conflicts between her testimony and the medical\n\nevidence  are entitled to deference.  Frustaglia v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof HHS, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).    \n      \n\n          Appellant  offered   no  evidence  that   her  past\n\nrelevant  work generally  involved  exposure to  concentrated\n\namounts of irritants, although she did show that at one time,\n\nduring a  company move, she  was exposed to large  amounts of\n\ndust. Appellant's  burden, however,  required proof  that she\n\ncould not return to her past type of work generally, not just\n\na  particular  job.    Gray,  760  F.2d  at  372.    Her  own\n                           \n\ndescription  of  her  work  experience  as primarily  indoor,\n\noffice  work, instead  suggested a  likely  lack of  severely\n\nlimiting environmental factors.   As appellee's  brief points\n\nout,   occupational   reference   materials   available   for\n\nadministrative   notice   reflect   a   general  absence   of\n\nenvironmental concerns in  the relevant job categories.   See\n                                                             \n\nU.S. Dep't of Labor, Selected  Characteristics of Occupations\n                                                             \n\nDefined in  the Dictionary  of Occupational  Titles 227,  243\n                                                   \n\n(1981)   (annotating   general    characteristics   of   work\n\n                             -5-\n\nenvironments   for  customer   service  representatives   and\n\nphotographic supplies salespersons); see also  Gray, 760 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  372  (approving  administrative  notice  of  occupational\n\nreference materials). \n\n          In   light  of  the  lack  of  convincing  evidence\n\nsuggesting a  contrary result, we  see no error in  the ALJ's\n\nfailure   to  employ   a   vocational   expert  to   describe\n\nenvironmental  conditions   at  the   relevant  work   sites.\n\nAppellant's reliance on Social Security Rulings 85-18 and 86-\n\n8 (\"SSRs\") is misplaced.  SSR 86-8 (superseded in part by SSR\n\n91-7c) provides  that when an  impairment has only  a minimal\n\neffect   on  a  person's   ability  to  perform   basic  work\n\nactivities,  \"in the  absence  of  contrary  evidence\"  or  a\n\nshowing  of \"unique\" work features, the ALJ may \"reasonab[ly]\n\nconclude that  the  claimant  is able  to  perform  her  past\n\nrelevant work.\"  That is exactly what the ALJ did here.  \n\n          The  other   regulation,  SSR  85-15,   is  largely\n\ninapposite  because it  focuses on  a  claimant's ability  to\n\nengage in the  entire range of occupations (step  five of the\n\nsequential  process).    That  issue  is  one  on  which  the\n\nSecretary bears the  burden of proof, but it  is not relevant\n\nunless the claimant first demonstrates an inability to return\n\nto her past  relevant work.  In any event, to the extent that\n\nSSR  85-15  provides  guidance  in  assessing  non-exertional\n\nimpairments, it  does  not require  the use  of a  vocational\n\n                             -6-\n\nexpert to assess  the impact of every medical  restriction on\n\nexposure to irritants, no matter  how minor.  Rather, SSR 85-\n\n15 specifically observes that a medical  limitation requiring\n\navoidance only  of concentrated  exposures is  not likely  to\n\nhave more  than a minimal  effect in  most job  environments.\n\nWhere there is  a greater restriction, the ruling states, the\n\nALJ should either consult occupational reference materials or\n\nobtain the services of a vocational expert.  \n\n          This  is  not a  close or  difficult case,  nor one\n\nbeyond the  ken of  the average person  familiar with  office\n\nenvironments.   The medical evidence  supported only  minimal\n\nrestrictions and generally those restrictions have little, if\n\nany, effect  in work environments consistent with appellant's\n\npast work experience.  If  further support was needed, it was\n\nforthcoming in the occupational reference materials.  \n\n          Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.\n                                                     \n\n                             -7-\n",

United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986) (after proper notice, failure to file a specific objection to magistrate's report will waive the right to appeal);  P.R. Loc.

Her own description of her work experience as primarily indoor, office work, instead suggested a likely lack of severely limiting environmental factors.  As appellee's brief points out, occupational reference materials available for administrative notice reflect a general absence of environmental concerns in the relevant job categories.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles 227, 243 (1981) (annotating general characteristics of work environments for customer service representatives and photographic supplies salespersons);   see also Gray, 760 F.2d at 372 (approving administrative notice of occupational reference materials).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the lack of convincing evidence suggesting a contrary result, we see no error in the ALJ's failure to employ a vocational expert to describe environmental conditions at the relevant work sites.

We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's application for disability benefits alleged an inability to work beginning at age 47, due to asthma, chest pain, back pain, high blood pressure and a nervous condition.  After a hearing at which appellant was represented by counsel, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") found that appellant suffered from bronchial asthma and allergic rhinopharyngitis.  The medical evidence, however, did not indicate that these conditions were as severe as appellant claimed, and the ALJ found appellant's testimony on this point \"not credible.\"  The ALJ concluded that appellant was capable of performing her past relevant work as a photo supply sales clerk or customer service representative.  The Appeals Council affirmed after a separate review, modifying the record to include a finding that evidence of appellant's alleged mental impairment also reflected a lack of the requisite severity, both alone and in combination with her other medical conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Secretary found that appellant was \"not disabled\" at step four of the familiar regulatory five-step sequential analysis, in that she was able to perform her past relevant work.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520.  Appellant then appealed to the district court, where the magistrate undertook a thorough and detailed review of the record, concluding that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary's decision.  The district judge accepted the magistrate's recommendation and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While appellant attempts here to reargue the substantial evidence issue on the basis of the entire record, in the district court she interposed only one specific objection to the magistrate's report.  She argued that the ALJ's finding that she could return to her past relevant work was error because the Secretary had not produced expert vocational testimony proving that her work environment was \"entirely free of irritants, pollutants and other potentially damaging conditions.\"  Since appellant and her counsel were notified that a failure to object would result in waiver of any issue not specifically raised, on appeal we need address only the issue properly preserved.   United States v. Valencia-Copete, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471042\"><a href=\"/opinion/471042/united-states-v-emiliano-valencia-copete/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1986) (after proper notice, failure to file a specific objection to magistrate's report will waive the right to appeal);  P.R. Loc.  R. 510.2;   see also Thomas v. Arn, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span> (1985) (upholding constitutionality of waiver rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's objection misperceives the burden of proof at the preliminary stages of the sequential analytic process, and assumes a conclusion about her condition that is not supported by the evidence.  \"It is well settled that a claimant seeking disability benefits has the initial burden of proving that her impairments prevent her from performing her former type of work.\"   Gray v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451515\"><a href=\"/opinion/451515/9-socsecrepser-262-unemplinsrep-cch-16051-elaine-gray-v-margaret/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 371 (1st Cir. 1985);   see also Goodermote v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409370\"><a href=\"/opinion/409370/william-edward-goodermote-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1982) (explaining burdens at steps of sequential analytic process).  The burden includes an obligation to present evidence relating to the particular demands of the job that the claimant alleges she cannot perform.   Dudley v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487124\"><a href=\"/opinion/487124/17-socsecrepser-473-unemplinsrep-cch-17321-leroy-dudley-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 795 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical evidence produced did not require a finding that appellant needed a work environment \"entirely free\" of irritants.  The evidence showed a history of asthma dating back to 1986, but with at most only a few sporadic episodes that might be characterized as severe.  Overall, appellant's treating allergist reported that her asthma attacks were not frequent, not severe, and her lungs were clear between episodes.  Pulmonary function studies and the remainder of the medical evidence were consistent with a conclusion that appellant suffered only a mildly restrictive ventilatory impairment.  Appellant had no exertional limitations whatsoever according to two residual functional capacity assessments.  Although one of the assessments might be construed as urging that appellant avoid any contact with extreme cold, wetness, humidity or fumes, the weight of the medical evidence most strongly corroborated the conclusion in the second assessment, that appellant should avoid only \"concentrated exposure\" to these irritants.  The ALJ's evaluation of appellant's testimonial credibility, and his resolution of conflicts between her testimony and the medical evidence are entitled to deference.   Frustaglia v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant offered no evidence that her past relevant work generally involved exposure to concentrated amounts of irritants, although she did show that at one time, during a company move, she was exposed to large amounts of dust.  Appellant's burden, however, required proof that she could not return to her past type of work generally, not just a particular job.   Gray, 760 F.2d at 372.  Her own description of her work experience as primarily indoor, office work, instead suggested a likely lack of severely limiting environmental factors.  As appellee's brief points out, occupational reference materials available for administrative notice reflect a general absence of environmental concerns in the relevant job categories.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles 227, 243 (1981) (annotating general characteristics of work environments for customer service representatives and photographic supplies salespersons);   see also Gray, 760 F.2d at 372 (approving administrative notice of occupational reference materials).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the lack of convincing evidence suggesting a contrary result, we see no error in the ALJ's failure to employ a vocational expert to describe environmental conditions at the relevant work sites.  Appellant's reliance on Social Security Rulings 85-18 and 86-8 (\"SSRs\") is misplaced.  SSR 86-8 (superseded in part by SSR 91-7c) provides that when an impairment has only a minimal effect on a person's ability to perform basic work activities, \"in the absence of contrary evidence\" or a showing of \"unique\" work features, the ALJ may \"reasonab[ly] conclude that the claimant is able to perform her past relevant work.\"  That is exactly what the ALJ did here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other regulation, SSR 85-15, is largely inapposite because it focuses on a claimant's ability to engage in the entire range of occupations (step five of the sequential process).  That issue is one on which the Secretary bears the burden of proof, but it is not relevant unless the claimant first demonstrates an inability to return to her past relevant work.  In any event, to the extent that SSR 85-15 provides guidance in assessing non-exertional impairments, it does not require the use of a vocational expert to assess the impact of every medical restriction on exposure to irritants, no matter how minor.  Rather, SSR 85-15 specifically observes that a medical limitation requiring avoidance only of concentrated exposures is not likely to have more than a minimal effect in most job environments.  Where there is a greater restriction, the ruling states, the ALJ should either consult occupational reference materials or obtain the services of a vocational expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a close or difficult case, nor one beyond the ken of the average person familiar with office environments.  The medical evidence supported only minimal restrictions and generally those restrictions have little, if any, effect in work environments consistent with appellant's past work experience.  If further support was needed, it was forthcoming in the occupational reference materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
