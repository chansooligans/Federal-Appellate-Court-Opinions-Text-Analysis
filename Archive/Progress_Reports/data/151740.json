Buntha Ly, a native and citizen of\n\nCambodia, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\"), which upheld an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial\n\nof his request for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder   the    Convention    Against    Torture    (\"CAT\").      We   deny   Ly's\n\npetition.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              Ly entered the United States on a tourist visa on April\n\n15, 2000, and did not leave when his visa expired on October 14,\n\n2000.      On November 22, 2000, Ly filed an application for asylum.\n\nMore than three years later, on February 6, 2004, the Department of\n\nHomeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Ly, who\n\nconceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the CAT.\n\n              Ly testified in support of his application at a hearing\n\non   May    12,    2008.    He   also   provided   documentary    evidence     to\n\ncorroborate his account.           We briefly summarize Ly's testimony,\n\nwhich the IJ found credible.\n\n              Ly was born in Cambodia in 1965.       In November 1983, when\n\nLy was eighteen years old, two police officers stopped him on the\n\nway to school and forcibly conscripted him into the Cambodian\n\nmilitary.         Ly served for eight years and achieved the rank of\n\nsecond lieutenant.         He left the military in 1991, following the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdissolution of his unit.        For the next two years, he worked a\n\nvariety of jobs.\n\n            In 1992, Ly joined the National United Front for a\n\nNeutral,     Peaceful,     Cooperative,    and       Independent     Cambodia\n\n(\"FUNCINPEC\"). As a party member, he made, posted, and distributed\n\nsigns and flyers.        He also solicited campaign donations.             His\n\nactivities were supervised by General Ho Sok, a senior FUNCINPEC\n\nmember.\n\n            On May 25, 1993, FUNCINPEC won the national election.\n\nHowever, the rival Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\"), led by a man\n\nnamed Hun Sen, refused to yield power and threatened civil war.\n\nThe two parties ultimately agreed to a power-sharing arrangement.\n\n            Following    the   election,   Ho    Sok,   now   a    government\n\nofficial, hired Ly as a police officer and assigned him to the\n\ndepartment's anti-drug unit as a second lieutenant.                The police\n\nforce included members of both FUNCINPEC and the CPP.             Ly reported\n\nto both Ho Sok and General Uno Hinko, a CPP member.                  When he\n\naccepted his job as a police officer, Ly knew the work was\n\ndangerous and that he risked personal harm.\n\n            In 1996, acting on Ho Sok's orders, Ly led a team of\n\nthirty    police   and   military   officers    to   confiscate    about   100\n\nkilograms of marijuana that was being shipped by a man named Mong\n\nRithy.    Rithy was a prominent CPP member and a close friend of Hun\n\nSen.   After the marijuana had been seized, Rithy denied that it was\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhis, claiming it instead belonged to a FUNCINPEC member.               Rithy\n\nalso made death threats against the officers who had participated\n\nin the seizure.         The incident created further tension between\n\nFUNCINPEC and the CPP.\n\n             In early July 1997, Hun Sen successfully led a violent\n\nCPP   coup    against    FUNCINPEC.      During   the    conflict,   Ho   Sok\n\ndisappeared; Ly believes he was killed by the CPP.\n\n             Ly was one of many FUNCINPEC members in the police\n\ndepartment who did not report for duty for one month after the\n\ncoup.   He returned to work after Hun Sen's newly appointed prime\n\nminister, a senior FUNCINPEC official, assured FUNCINPEC members\n\nthat they could safely resume their duties.\n\n             In 1998, the CPP won the national election.             However,\n\nFUNCINPEC officials continued to serve in the government.                  Ly\n\nremained an active FUNCINPEC member.\n\n             On June 16, 1999, Ly was ordered to confiscate about 100\n\nkilograms of opium and arrest the individuals smuggling it, who\n\nwere affiliated with Hun Sen.         The seized opium was stored in the\n\nanti-drug unit's office \"for a long time.\"              Under pressure from\n\ninternational supporters of Cambodia's anti-drug efforts, General\n\nHeng Pao, a high-ranking CPP official and close associate of Hun\n\nSen, publicly pledged to burn the opium.          Heng Pao instead burned\n\na \"fake box\" and sold the opium for profit.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Ly learned of Heng Pao's deception and investigated the\n\nopium sale, with help from his friend and fellow officer, Savoeun\n\nSar.    The two uncovered information about Heng Pao's buyer.     But\n\nHeng Pao heard about Ly and Sar's inquiries and warned them to stay\n\nquiet about their discovery.      Despite Heng Pao's warning, the\n\ndetails of the opium sale were eventually leaked to the public.\n\n           Some time after the leak, Heng Pao arranged for Sar to be\n\ndispatched to investigate an incident report.     Upon arrival, Sar\n\nwas fatally shot by two unknown individuals, who planted opium on\n\nhis motorcycle.   After Sar's death, Heng Pao accused Sar of having\n\nbeen a drug dealer.\n\n           Ly feared that he would suffer the same fate as Sar.   He\n\nbelieved Heng Pao and the CCP were determined to eliminate all\n\nFUNCINPEC members from the anti-drug unit.    On February 15, 2000,\n\nLy received word from a friend that Heng Pao was planning to kill\n\nhim like he had killed Sar.   Ly moved his wife and two children to\n\nhis mother-in-law's home in the countryside and stopped going to\n\nwork.   In April 2000, he fled Cambodia and traveled to the United\n\nStates.   Ly's family remained in Cambodia.\n\n           At some point after Ly's departure, two CPP-affiliated\n\npolice officers came to his family's home.       The officers were\n\nlooking for Ly's son, who had allegedly \"caused some injury to Hun\n\nSen.\"   The officers insisted that Ly's son appear in court or pay\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f$2,500 for \"pain and suffering.\"    When Ly's wife said she did not\n\nhave the money, the officers hit her.\n\n            The officers noticed a photograph of Ly in his police\n\nuniform hanging on the wall.       They asked who the man in the\n\nphotograph was, and Ly's wife replied that it was her husband, who\n\nhad moved to the United States.        The officers said they were\n\nlooking for him.     Ly's wife ultimately paid the officers $500,\n\nafter which they left, insisting that she had two weeks to pay them\n\nan additional $2,000.    After this incident, Ly's family relocated\n\nto a village on the Thai-Cambodia border.\n\n            Ly's   documentary   evidence   included,   among   other\n\nmaterials, a photograph of Ly in his police uniform, photographs of\n\nSar's corpse, a letter from a FUNCINPEC official confirming Ly's\n\nparty membership and warning that Ly faced danger if he returned to\n\nCambodia, an affidavit from Ly's wife, and Ly's identification\n\ncards from the military, the police department, and FUNCINPEC.     Ly\n\nalso provided information and media reports on conditions in\n\nCambodia.\n\n            The IJ found Ly's testimony credible but denied his\n\npetition because Ly had failed to establish a nexus between his\n\nfears and one of the five statutorily protected grounds.        See 8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A).   The IJ found that Ly's fears were solely\n\na product of \"his having conduct[ed] himself honorably as an honest\n\npolice officer in the past and potentially being in the future\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fvictimized or perhaps even killed by corrupt police officers and\n\ncriminals in the country of Cambodia.\"              The IJ held that the\n\nfailure of Ly's asylum claim meant he could not satisfy the more\n\nexacting requirements for withholding of removal and rejected Ly's\n\napplication for CAT relief, since Ly had not claimed he would be\n\ntortured in Cambodia.\n\n          The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of Ly's application for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.         The BIA concluded that Ly's\n\nfears were not related to a protected ground, citing the absence of\n\n\"any evidence that the threats [Ly] received were even in part\n\nmotivated by his political opinion.\"           It found that Ly was instead\n\n\"likely threatened to discourage him from reporting the actions of\n\ncorrupt police officers.\" The BIA also rejected Ly's argument that\n\nhe had a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of\n\nhis membership in the social group \"former police officers.\"\n\n          The    BIA   further   agreed   with     the   IJ's   determination\n\nregarding Ly's ineligibility for withholding of removal and noted\n\nthat he had failed to appeal the IJ's denial of CAT relief.\n\n                                    II.\n\n          When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ's ruling but also\n\nexamines some of the IJ's conclusions, we review both the BIA's and\n\nIJ's opinions.     Matovu v. Holder, 577 F.3d 383, 386 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   Our    review   of   BIA   and   IJ    findings   of   fact   is   for\n\nsubstantial evidence.     Id.    \"Under this deferential standard, we\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\faccept these findings so long as they are grounded in reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole,\" id. (quoting Sharari v. Gonzรกles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st\n\nCir.   2005))   (internal   quotation   marks   omitted),   and   grant   a\n\npetition only \"if the record compels a conclusion contrary to that\n\nreached by the agency,\" Lopez Perez v. Holder, 587 F.3d 456, 460\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           An applicant for asylum must show that he suffered past\n\npersecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\ngrounds of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"       8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A);\n\nMatovu, 577 F.3d at 386.     A showing of past persecution gives rise\n\nto a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.          Anacassus v.\n\nHolder, 602 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2010).        Absent such a showing, a\n\npetitioner may still qualify for asylum by providing \"specific\n\nproof\" that his fear of future persecution \"is both subjectively\n\ngenuine and objectively reasonable.\"        Decky v. Holder, 587 F.3d\n\n104, 110 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Castillo-Dรญaz v. Holder, 562 F.3d\n\n23, 26 (1st Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Ly argues that the BIA and IJ erred by determining that\n\nhe had failed to connect the risks he faced to one of the protected\n\ngrounds.   Even if the threats Ly received from Rithy and Heng Pao\n\nwere sufficiently harmful to permit a finding of past persecution,\n\ncf. Butt v. Keisler, 506 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 2007), substantial\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fevidence supported the BIA and IJ's findings that these threats\n\nwere not on account of a protected ground but were instead entirely\n\nmotivated by Ly's steadfast performance of his duties as a police\n\nofficer.\n\n              Ly knew that police work posed distinct risks when he\n\nopted for a career in law enforcement.                  His testimony provides no\n\nbasis   to    conclude       that   these    risks      were   exacerbated      by   his\n\npolitical opinions.           The threats he faced, however serious, were\n\ntriggered by his participation in specific drug investigations. Ly\n\nprovided no evidence that either Rithy or Heng Pao were motivated\n\nby   his    party     affiliation     or    that   fellow      FUNCINPEC-affiliated\n\nofficers were systematically targeted.                    The threat Ly's family\n\nreceived after his departure is consistent with his having been\n\ntargeted for his participation in drug seizures.                       To the extent\n\nthat Ly's argument depends on his own assessment of Rithy and Heng\n\nPao's      motives,    the    IJ    and    BIA   were    \"free    to   reject    [his]\n\nspeculation as to motive\" despite \"finding [him] credible as to\n\nhistorical facts.\"           Ziu v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 202, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); see also Hernandez-Cabana v. Mukasey, 262 F. App'x 287, 289\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (finding that threats received by a district\n\nattorney \"were not on account of one of the five enumerated\n\ngrounds\").\n\n              Ly's effort to retroactively cast his activities as anti-\n\ncorruption whistleblowing is also unavailing.                      Cf. Fedunyak v.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fGonzales,      477    F.3d   1126,    1129    (9th    Cir.      2007)    (\"The   act   of\n\nwhistle-blowing against corrupt government officials . . . may\n\nconstitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of\n\npersecution      on    account   of    political      opinion.\"         (alteration    in\n\noriginal) (quoting Grava v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.\n\n2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).                     The record does not\n\ncompel the conclusion that Ly attempted, let alone was targeted\n\nfor, any such activity.\n\n               For these same reasons, substantial evidence supported\n\nthe IJ's and BIA's determination that Ly's fears of future harm\n\nwere unrelated to a protected ground.                 His remaining claims lack\n\nmerit.1   \"While there may be scenarios where a government official\n\ninvolved in law enforcement should not be precluded from making an\n\nasylum    or    withholding      claim,      this    is   not    such    a   scenario.\"\n\nHernandez-Cabana, 262 F. App'x at 289 (citations omitted).                             Ly\n\nchose a dangerous profession and performed his duties honorably.\n\nBut we cannot say the record compels us to reach a conclusion\n\ndifferent from the IJ and BIA.\n\n               The petition is denied.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Ly's failure to present his argument for CAT relief to\nthe BIA precludes our jurisdiction over this unexhausted claim.\nSee, e.g., Jia Duan Dong v. Holder, 587 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2009);\nSilva v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006). Ly has not\nappealed the BIA's rejection of his withholding of removal claim.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f",

We deny Ly's petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Ly entered the United States on a tourist visa on April 15, 2000, and did not leave when his visa expired on October 14, 2000. On November 22, 2000, Ly filed an application for asylum. More than three years later, on February 6, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Ly, who conceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Ly testified in support of his application at a hearing on May 12, 2008. He also provided documentary evidence to corroborate his account. We briefly summarize Ly's testimony, which the IJ found credible.</p>\n<p>Ly was born in Cambodia in 1965. In November 1983, when Ly was eighteen years old, two police officers stopped him on the way to school and forcibly conscripted him into the Cambodian military. Ly served for eight years and achieved the rank of second lieutenant. He left the military in 1991, following the dissolution of his unit. For the next two years, he worked a variety of jobs.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Ly joined the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent Cambodia (\"FUNCINPEC\"). As a party member, he made, posted, and distributed signs and flyers. He also solicited campaign donations. His activities were supervised by General Ho Sok, a senior FUNCINPEC member.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 1993, FUNCINPEC won the national election. However, the rival Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\"), led by a man named Hun Sen, refused to yield power and threatened civil war. The two parties ultimately agreed to a power-sharing arrangement.</p>\n<p>Following the election, Ho Sok, now a government official, hired Ly as a police officer and assigned him to the department's anti-drug unit as a second lieutenant. The police force included members of both FUNCINPEC and the CPP. Ly reported to both Ho Sok and General Uno Hinko, a CPP member. When he accepted his job as a police officer, Ly knew the work was dangerous and that he risked personal harm.</p>\n<p>In 1996, acting on Ho Sok's orders, Ly led a team of thirty police and military officers to confiscate about 100 kilograms of marijuana that was being shipped by a man named Mong Rithy. Rithy was a prominent CPP member and a close friend of Hun Sen. After the marijuana had been seized, Rithy denied that it was his, claiming it instead belonged to a FUNCINPEC member.

After Sar's death, Heng Pao accused Sar of having been a drug dealer.</p>\n<p>Ly feared that he would suffer the same fate as Sar. He believed Heng Pao and the CPP were determined to eliminate all FUNCINPEC members from the anti-drug unit. On February 15, 2000, Ly received word from a friend that Heng Pao was planning to kill him like he had killed Sar. Ly moved his wife and two children to his mother-in-law's home in the countryside and stopped going to work. In April 2000, he fled Cambodia and traveled to the United States. Ly's family remained in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>At some point after Ly's departure, two CPP-affiliated police officers came to his family's home. The officers were looking for Ly's son, who had allegedly \"caused some injury to Hun Sen.\" The officers insisted that Ly's son appear in court or pay $2,500 for \"pain and suffering.\" When Ly's wife said she did not have the money, the officers hit her.</p>\n<p>The officers noticed a photograph of Ly in his police uniform hanging on the wall. They asked who the man in the photograph was, and Ly's wife replied that it was her husband, who had moved to the United States. The officers said they were looking for him. Ly's wife ultimately paid the officers $500, after which they left, insisting that she had two weeks to pay them an additional $2,000. After this incident, Ly's family relocated to a village on the Thai-Cambodia border.</p>\n<p>Ly's documentary evidence included, among other materials, a photograph of Ly in his police uniform, photographs of Sar's corpse, a letter from a FUNCINPEC official confirming Ly's party membership and warning that Ly faced danger if he returned to Cambodia, an affidavit from Ly's wife, and Ly's identification cards from the military, the police department, and FUNCINPEC. Ly also provided information and media reports on conditions in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>The IJ found Ly's testimony credible but denied his petition because Ly had failed to establish a nexus between his fears and one of the five statutorily protected grounds. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A). The IJ found that Ly's fears were solely a product of \"his having conduct[ed] himself honorably as an honest police officer in the past and potentially being in the future victimized or perhaps even killed by corrupt police officers and criminals in the country of Cambodia.\" The IJ held that the failure of Ly's asylum claim meant he could not satisfy the more exacting requirements for withholding of removal and rejected Ly's application for CAT relief, since Ly had not claimed he would be tortured in Cambodia.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of Ly's application for asylum and withholding of removal. The BIA concluded that Ly's fears were not related to a protected ground, citing the absence of \"any evidence that the threats [Ly] received were even in part motivated by his political opinion.\" It found that Ly was instead \"likely threatened to discourage him from reporting the actions of corrupt police officers.\" The BIA also rejected Ly's argument that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of his membership in the social group \"former police officers.\"</p>\n<p>The BIA further agreed with the IJ's determination regarding Ly's ineligibility for withholding of removal and noted that he had failed to appeal the IJ's denial of CAT relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ's ruling but also examines some of the IJ's conclusions, we review both the BIA's and IJ's opinions. <i>Matovu v.

Keisler,</i> 506 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.2007), substantial evidence supported the BIA and IJ's findings that these threats were not on account of a protected ground but were instead entirely motivated by Ly's steadfast performance of his duties as a police officer.</p>\n<p>Ly knew that police work posed distinct risks when he opted for a career in law enforcement.

We deny Ly's petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Ly entered the United States on a tourist visa on April 15, 2000, and did not leave when his visa expired on October 14, 2000. On November 22, 2000, Ly filed an application for asylum. More than three years later, on February 6, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Ly, who conceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Ly testified in support of his application at a hearing on May 12, 2008. He also provided documentary evidence to corroborate his account. We briefly summarize Ly's testimony, which the IJ found credible.</p>\n<p>Ly was born in Cambodia in 1965. In November 1983, when Ly was eighteen years old, two police officers stopped him on the way to school and forcibly conscripted him into the Cambodian military. Ly served for eight years and achieved the rank of second lieutenant. He left the military in 1991, following the dissolution of his unit. For the next two years, he worked a variety of jobs.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Ly joined the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent Cambodia (\"FUNCINPEC\"). As a party member, he made, posted, and distributed signs and flyers. He also solicited campaign donations. His activities were supervised by General Ho Sok, a senior FUNCINPEC member.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 1993, FUNCINPEC won the national election. However, the rival Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\"), led by a man named Hun Sen, refused to yield power and threatened civil war. The two parties ultimately agreed to a power-sharing arrangement.</p>\n<p>Following the election, Ho Sok, now a government official, hired Ly as a police officer and assigned him to the department's anti-drug unit as a second lieutenant. The police force included members of both FUNCINPEC and the CPP. Ly reported to both Ho Sok and General Uno Hinko, a CPP member. When he accepted his job as a police officer, Ly knew the work was dangerous and that he risked personal harm.</p>\n<p>In 1996, acting on Ho Sok's orders, Ly led a team of thirty police and military officers to confiscate about 100 kilograms of marijuana that was being shipped by a man named Mong Rithy. Rithy was a prominent CPP member and a close friend of Hun Sen. After the marijuana had been seized, Rithy denied that it was his, claiming it instead belonged to a FUNCINPEC member. Rithy also made death threats against the officers who had participated in the seizure. The incident created further tension between FUNCINPEC and the CPP.</p>\n<p>In early July 1997, Hun Sen successfully led a violent CPP coup against FUNCINPEC. During the conflict, Ho Sok disappeared; Ly believes he was killed by the CPP.</p>\n<p>Ly was one of many FUNCINPEC members in the police department who did not report for duty for one month after the coup. He returned to work after Hun Sen's newly appointed prime minister, a senior FUNCINPEC official, assured FUNCINPEC members that they could safely resume their duties.</p>\n<p>In 1998, the CPP won the national election. However, FUNCINPEC officials continued to serve in the government. Ly remained an active FUNCINPEC member.</p>\n<p>On June 16, 1999, Ly was ordered to confiscate about 100 kilograms of opium and arrest the individuals smuggling it, who were affiliated with Hun Sen. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> seized opium was stored in the anti-drug unit's office \"for a long time.\" Under pressure from international supporters of Cambodia's anti-drug efforts, General Heng Pao, a high-ranking CPP official and close associate of Hun Sen, publicly pledged to burn the opium. Heng Pao instead burned a \"fake box\" and sold the opium for profit.</p>\n<p>Ly learned of Heng Pao's deception and investigated the opium sale, with help from his friend and fellow officer, Savoeun Sar. The two uncovered information about Heng Pao's buyer. But Heng Pao heard about Ly and Sar's inquiries and warned them to stay quiet about their discovery. Despite Heng Pao's warning, the details of the opium sale were eventually leaked to the public.</p>\n<p>Some time after the leak, Heng Pao arranged for Sar to be dispatched to investigate an incident report. Upon arrival, Sar was fatally shot by two unknown individuals, who planted opium on his motorcycle. After Sar's death, Heng Pao accused Sar of having been a drug dealer.</p>\n<p>Ly feared that he would suffer the same fate as Sar. He believed Heng Pao and the CPP were determined to eliminate all FUNCINPEC members from the anti-drug unit. On February 15, 2000, Ly received word from a friend that Heng Pao was planning to kill him like he had killed Sar. Ly moved his wife and two children to his mother-in-law's home in the countryside and stopped going to work. In April 2000, he fled Cambodia and traveled to the United States. Ly's family remained in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>At some point after Ly's departure, two CPP-affiliated police officers came to his family's home.
