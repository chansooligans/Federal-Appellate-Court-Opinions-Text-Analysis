William G. Young,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                     Souter, Associate Justice,*\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Sergei Lemberg, with whom Lemberg & Associates, LLC was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Edward C. Cooley, with whom Giarrusso, Norton, Cooley &\nMcGlone, P.C. was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                               July 14, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f          SOUTER, Associate Justice.   A subsidiary of the appellee\n\nCUNA Mutual Insurance Company, Inc., was the transferee of a bank’s\n\ninterest in a truck subject to a defaulted installment loan, and\n\nthe CUNA subsidiary retained a Texas company, the appellee Assets\n\nRecovered, LLC to repossess the vehicle.     The truck was found on\n\nthe lot of Stanley Services, Inc., which had taken possession of it\n\nusing equipment of its own, according to a receipt indicating a\n\nmileage figure of 66,782. In anticipation of eventual sale by Auto\n\nAuction of New England, Assets acted on CUNA’s behalf in obtaining\n\na Texas title certificate.   Since the truck was locked and had no\n\nkeys, Assets did not read the truck’s digital odometer, but instead\n\ngave the Texas agency an odometer reading of 66,782 miles, not\n\nrealizing that the mileage figure on the receipt referred to\n\nStanley’s transport vehicle, not the truck.     A title certificate\n\nwas issued accordingly.\n\n          Thereafter, new keys were made for the truck and it was\n\ndiscovered that the odometer actually read 31,245.     Auto Auction\n\nhad not yet sold the truck, and Assets still had the title\n\ncertificate with the higher, wrong number.    Assets applied for an\n\namended certificate showing the actual odometer figure, which was\n\nobtained before the truck changed hands, first to a wholesaler, and\n\nthen to a retail dealer, who finally sold it to the appellant,\n\nCherise Roach.   She took title by accepting a certificate showing\n\nmileage under 32,000.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f          In due course, Roach discovered she had a lemon and sued\n\nthe appellees CUNA and Assets1 on a claim they had violated a law\n\ncommonly known as the Odometer Act, which requires a transferor of\n\na motor vehicle to state correct mileage or to say that mileage is\n\nunknown, 49 U.S.C. § 32705(a)(1)(A) and (B), and gives a transferee\n\na private right of action for a statutory violation committed with\n\nintent to defraud, § 32710(a) and (b).      The parties agree the\n\nintent requirement may be satisfied by showing a transferor’s\n\nreckless disregard for accuracy, and we may assume this to be so.\n\nSee Haynes v. Manning, 917 F.2d 450, 453 (10th Cir. 1990).      On\n\ncross motions, the district court granted summary judgement to CUNA\n\nand Assets.   We affirm.\n\n          The dispositive issue as the case was litigated in the\n\ntrial court was the nature and significance of the appellees’\n\nintent when obtaining the first title certificate with the 66,782\n\nnumber: was there a genuine dispute about any material fact bearing\n\non the intent that stood in the way of either Roach’s or the\n\nappellees’ entitlement to judgement as a matter of law?    Roach’s\n\nanswer in her favor seems to assume that an error resulting from\n\nmisreading a record (Stanley’s record, in this case) is immune to\n\nsubsequent correction and is an actionable violation of the Act on\n\nthe complaint of any downstream transferee who later learns that\n\n\n     1\n       Appellee Wachovia Corporation informed this court by letter\nthat it had settled with Roach and would not file a brief in this\nappeal.\n\n                               -3-\n\fthe error had once been made.        Perhaps sensing the unlikelihood\n\nthat the law could be in her favor, she resorts to alternative\n\nstratagems: on the one hand, she claims that reliance on the\n\nearlier, mistaken figure is not a necessary element of a private\n\nclaim; on the other, she claims that she was “entitled . . . to\n\nrely on the veracity of historical odometer disclosures” and was in\n\nfact “guided” by the earlier figure to make an imprudent purchase.\n\n           We agree with the district court that Roach’s position is\n\nuntenable, however stated. First, we will assume for argument that\n\nthe mistaken reading of Stanley’s receipt (as showing the truck’s\n\nmileage)   was   negligent,   but   negligence   is    not   recklessness\n\ntantamount to fraudulent intent, and reliance upon the receipt in\n\nthese   circumstances   (where   access   to   the    odometer   was   not\n\nimmediately possible and where the mistake was timely corrected\n\nbefore Assets transferred the truck) cannot fairly give rise to an\n\ninference of reckless disregard for the truth.         See W. Keeton et\n\nal., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 34, p. 213 (5th ed.\n\n1984) (defining “reckless” as intentional acts “of an unreasonable\n\ncharacter in disregard of a known or obvious risk . . . usually\n\naccompanied by a conscious indifference to the consequences”); cf.\n\nUnited States v. Ranney   298 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 2002) (“reckless\n\ndisregard for the truth” requires proof that the speaker “in fact\n\nentertained serious doubts as to the truth of the [statement]” and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmay be “inferred from circumstances evincing obvious reasons to\n\ndoubt [its] veracity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          Next, even if the appellees had been reckless, Roach’s\n\nclaim must fail for the further reason that she can prove no injury\n\ncaused by the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation. See Huson v.\n\nGen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 108 F.3d 172, 173 (8th Cir. 1997) (no\n\nliability where a failure to investigate “could not have caused any\n\ninjury” to the plaintiffs).   There is no support in the statute for\n\nthe astonishing notion that a mistake once made, whatever the\n\nintent behind it, is impervious to correction, such that a buyer\n\napprised of the correction may ignore it. On the contrary, Roach’s\n\nposition is at odds with the very justification for providing a\n\nprivate cause of action for statutory violation; there may well be\n\nmore than one strand of policy behind the private remedy, but at\n\nthe least it is a remedy for injury.      See 49 U.S.C. § 32710(a)\n\n(creating liability for treble damages with a $1,500 minimum).   It\n\nis a source of compensation for harm traceable to a statutory\n\nviolation, whereas Roach can trace no causation to a mileage\n\nstatement that had been amended by the time she bought the truck.\n\nIn sum, there were no undisputed facts that entitled Roach to a\n\nfinding that Assets acted with reckless disregard of the truth when\n\nit filed the original application for a title certificate, nor\n\nwould such a finding, even if permissible, support a conclusion of\n\nliability on Roach’s private complaint.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f             The appellees’ converse request for judgement as a\n\nmatter of law fares better.      There being no proffered evidence to\n\nthe contrary, the only sensible explanation for the initial higher\n\nfigure is that someone at Assets read the Stanley record as\n\nreferring to mileage on the repossessed truck, instead of Stanley’s\n\nrecovery vehicle. As we explained, that was conceivably negligent,\n\nbut it could not reasonably be seen, without more, as evidence of\n\nreckless disregard for truth.           Moreover, as the district judge\n\nconcluded, Assets’s correction of the figure before transfer of the\n\ntruck   precluded    any   reasonable    inference   that   Assets   or   its\n\nprincipal, CUNA, ever meant to defraud someone when it used the\n\nearlier number. However true it is that “summary judg[e]ment is to\n\nbe used sparingly when intent or motive is at issue,” Catrone v.\n\nThoroughbred Racing Ass’ns of N. Am., Inc., 929 F.2d 881, 889 (1st\n\nCir. 1991), this is the unusual instance in which no fact finder\n\ncould   reasonably    infer   the   fraudulent   intent     necessary     for\n\nliability.   And of course, as noted before, the correction stands\n\nin the way of finding any causation between the original statement\n\nand Roach’s bad buy, as the private cause of action would require.\n\n           The view of the case just set out rests on our resolution\n\nof disputed issues about the use of two affidavits, the first being\n\nthat of Filipe Ossa, Assets’s managing officer, filed by the\n\nappellees. Roach objected that Ossa was not speaking from personal\n\nknowledge, with the consequence that his affidavit was incompetent\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fas summary judgement evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1); Perez\n\nv.   Volvo     Car    Co.,   247   F.3d    303,       315-16      (1st     Cir.    2001).\n\nHowevermuch Roach would now like to expand the scope of the\n\nstatements to which this objection might refer, in the district\n\ncourt   her    sole     specific   reference          was   to    Ossa’s     conclusory\n\nallegation that Assets did not use the wrong figure intentionally\n\nwhen it submitted the first title application.                         See Addendum to\n\nReply   Brief    for     Appellant   4.         But    this      is    a   point   of    no\n\nconsequence, for disregarding Ossa’s conclusion would not affect\n\nthe appellees’ entitlement to judgement. As explained before, even\n\nif the original application included a reckless misstatement, Roach\n\ncould not show a causal connection to her decision to buy the truck\n\naccompanied by a corrected title certificate.                         Any error in the\n\ndistrict court’s consideration of the affidavit was thus harmless.\n\n              The second disputed affidavit goes to Roach’s fall-back\n\nposition that even the corrected figure of 31,245 was a fraudulent\n\nfalsehood, despite its being the reading on the odometer as found\n\nwhen the new keys allowed inspection of the digital display.                            Her\n\nonly evidence for this claim was the affidavit of William Zaher,\n\nthe principal of a “diagnostic” service that Roach asked to examine\n\nthe truck after she had driven it, unsatisfactorily, for about\n\n8,000 miles.         Zaher stated that he inspected the truck and found\n\nits condition “entirely inconsistent” with the odometer reading.\n\nOn appellee’s motion, the district court struck the affidavit on\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fthe ground that Roach had failed to comply with the Rule 26\n\nrequirement that a party disclose the identity of any expert\n\nwitness to be relied upon and supply a report indicating the\n\nwitness’s qualifications to provide expert opinion testimony.   See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).\n\n          There was no abuse of discretion in this ruling.      See\n\nPoulis-Minott v. Smith, 388 F.3d 354, 357 (1st Cir. 2004).    Roach\n\nclaims that she disclosed that a “representative” of the diagnostic\n\nservice “may” testify about the relationship of odometer mileage to\n\nthe condition of the truck, but she supplied neither Zaher’s name\n\n(also required, along with his address and phone number, by Rule\n\n26(a)(1)(A)(I)) nor the basis claimed for his qualification as an\n\nexpert before she submitted his affidavit in support of her summary\n\njudgment motion.   Her argument that, according to the court’s\n\nscheduling order, the deadline for these disclosures was still\n\nmonths off misses the mark.    “The purpose of the expert disclosure\n\nrules is to facilitate a fair contest with the basic issues and\n\nfacts disclosed to the fullest practical extent” and to prevent\n\nparties from seeking the “unfair tactical advantage that can be\n\ngained by failing to unveil an expert in a timely fashion.”\n\nPoulis-Minott, 388 F.3d at 358 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nRoach’s failure to make the disclosures before she attempted to\n\noffer the affidavit as evidence at summary judgement frustrated\n\nthat purpose, even if she still had time to make disclosures before\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe evidence would be offered at trial.       Equally to the point is\n\nthe requirement of Rule 56, invoked by Roach herself in objecting\n\nto the Ossa affidavit, that affidavits on summary judgement must\n\nshow the admissibility of the proffered evidence by including,\n\namong other things, an indication “that the affiant is competent to\n\ntestify on the matters stated.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1).   Roach’s\n\nfailure to disclose whatever qualifications Zaher may have as an\n\nexpert runs afoul of the rule.          Her only response is that his\n\naffidavit was proffered as that of a fact witness who happened to\n\nbe an expert, not as that of an expert, a claim that is manifestly\n\nerroneous.   The Zaher affidavit was properly kept out, and without\n\nit Roach had no basis to raise any issue of fact about the accuracy\n\nof the actual odometer reading or the appellees’ reliance on it.2\n\n          The judgement is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Roach argues that the affidavit should have stood in the way\nof granting appellees’ motion even if it was incompetent to support\nher own, citing Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88 (1st\nCir. 1993).    The case is no help to her, holding only that an\naffidavit must satisfy Rule 56, whoever wishes to rely on it.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

It\n\nis a source of compensation for harm traceable to a statutory\n\nviolation, whereas Roach can trace no causation to a mileage\n\nstatement that had been amended by the time she bought the truck.\n\nIn sum, there were no undisputed facts that entitled Roach to a\n\nfinding that Assets acted with reckless disregard of the truth when\n\nit filed the original application for a title certificate, nor\n\nwould such a finding, even if permissible, support a conclusion of\n\nliability on Roach’s private complaint.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f             The appellees’ converse request for judgement as a\n\nmatter of law fares better.      There being no proffered evidence to\n\nthe contrary, the only sensible explanation for the initial higher\n\nfigure is that someone at Assets read the Stanley record as\n\nreferring to mileage on the repossessed truck, instead of Stanley’s\n\nrecovery vehicle. As we explained, that was conceivably negligent,\n\nbut it could not reasonably be seen, without more, as evidence of\n\nreckless disregard for truth.           Moreover, as the district judge\n\nconcluded, Assets’s correction of the figure before transfer of the\n\ntruck   precluded    any   reasonable    inference   that   Assets   or   its\n\nprincipal, CUNA, ever meant to defraud someone when it used the\n\nearlier number. However true it is that “summary judg[e]ment is to\n\nbe used sparingly when intent or motive is at issue,” Catrone v.\n\nThoroughbred Racing Ass’ns of N. Am., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558580\"><a href=\"/opinion/558580/patrick-catrone-v-thoroughbred-racing-associations-of-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 889 (1st\n\nCir. 1991), this is the unusual instance in which no fact finder\n\ncould   reasonably    infer   the   fraudulent   intent     necessary     for\n\nliability.   And of course, as noted before, the correction stands\n\nin the way of finding any causation between the original statement\n\nand Roach’s bad buy, as the private cause of action would require.\n\n           The view of the case just set out rests on our resolution\n\nof disputed issues about the use of two affidavits, the first being\n\nthat of Filipe Ossa, Assets’s managing officer, filed by the\n\nappellees. Roach objected that Ossa was not speaking from personal\n\nknowledge, with the consequence that his affidavit was incompetent\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fas summary judgement evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1); Perez\n\nv.   Volvo     Car    Co.,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199393\"><a href=\"/opinion/199393/perez-de-munoz-v-volvo-car-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,       315-16      (1st     Cir.    2001).\n\nHowevermuch Roach would now like to expand the scope of the\n\nstatements to which this objection might refer, in the district\n\ncourt   her    sole     specific   reference          was   to    Ossa’s     conclusory\n\nallegation that Assets did not use the wrong figure intentionally\n\nwhen it submitted the first title application.                         See Addendum to\n\nReply   Brief    for     Appellant   4.         But    this      is    a   point   of    no\n\nconsequence, for disregarding Ossa’s conclusion would not affect\n\nthe appellees’ entitlement to judgement. As explained before, even\n\nif the original application included a reckless misstatement, Roach\n\ncould not show a causal connection to her decision to buy the truck\n\naccompanied by a corrected title certificate.                         Any error in the\n\ndistrict court’s consideration of the affidavit was thus harmless.\n\n              The second disputed affidavit goes to Roach’s fall-back\n\nposition that even the corrected figure of 31,245 was a fraudulent\n\nfalsehood, despite its being the reading on the odometer as found\n\nwhen the new keys allowed inspection of the digital display.                            Her\n\nonly evidence for this claim was the affidavit of William Zaher,\n\nthe principal of a “diagnostic” service that Roach asked to examine\n\nthe truck after she had driven it, unsatisfactorily, for about\n\n8,000 miles.         Zaher stated that he inspected the truck and found\n\nits condition “entirely inconsistent” with the odometer reading.\n\nOn appellee’s motion, the district court struck the affidavit on\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fthe ground that Roach had failed to comply with the Rule 26\n\nrequirement that a party disclose the identity of any expert\n\nwitness to be relied upon and supply a report indicating the\n\nwitness’s qualifications to provide expert opinion testimony.   See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).\n\n          There was no abuse of discretion in this ruling.      See\n\nPoulis-Minott v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201308\"><a href=\"/opinion/201308/poulis-minott-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (1st Cir. 2004).    Roach\n\nclaims that she disclosed that a “representative” of the diagnostic\n\nservice “may” testify about the relationship of odometer mileage to\n\nthe condition of the truck, but she supplied neither Zaher’s name\n\n(also required, along with his address and phone number, by Rule\n\n26(a)(1)(A)(I)) nor the basis claimed for his qualification as an\n\nexpert before she submitted his affidavit in support of her summary\n\njudgment motion.   Her argument that, according to the court’s\n\nscheduling order, the deadline for these disclosures was still\n\nmonths off misses the mark.    “The purpose of the expert disclosure\n\nrules is to facilitate a fair contest with the basic issues and\n\nfacts disclosed to the fullest practical extent” and to prevent\n\nparties from seeking the “unfair tactical advantage that can be\n\ngained by failing to unveil an expert in a timely fashion.”\n\nPoulis-Minott, 388 F.3d at 358 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nRoach’s failure to make the disclosures before she attempted to\n\noffer the affidavit as evidence at summary judgement frustrated\n\nthat purpose, even if she still had time to make disclosures before\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe evidence would be offered at trial.       Equally to the point is\n\nthe requirement of Rule 56, invoked by Roach herself in objecting\n\nto the Ossa affidavit, that affidavits on summary judgement must\n\nshow the admissibility of the proffered evidence by including,\n\namong other things, an indication “that the affiant is competent to\n\ntestify on the matters stated.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1).   Roach’s\n\nfailure to disclose whatever qualifications Zaher may have as an\n\nexpert runs afoul of the rule.          Her only response is that his\n\naffidavit was proffered as that of a fact witness who happened to\n\nbe an expert, not as that of an expert, a claim that is manifestly\n\nerroneous.   The Zaher affidavit was properly kept out, and without\n\nit Roach had no basis to raise any issue of fact about the accuracy\n\nof the actual odometer reading or the appellees’ reliance on it.2\n\n          The judgement is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Roach argues that the affidavit should have stood in the way\nof granting appellees’ motion even if it was incompetent to support\nher own, citing Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656105\"><a href=\"/opinion/656105/prodliabrep-cch-p-13686-mary-hayes-administrator-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\nCir. 1993).    The case is no help to her, holding only that an\naffidavit must satisfy Rule 56, whoever wishes to rely on it.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f</pre>",
