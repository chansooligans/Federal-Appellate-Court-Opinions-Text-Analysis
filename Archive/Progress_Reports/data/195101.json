Vazquez, Assistant  United  States  Attorney, with  whom\n                \nCharles E. Fitzwilliam,  United States Attorney,  and Jose A.  Quiles-\n                                                                 \nEspinosa,  Senior Litigation Counsel, Criminal Division, were on brief\n   \nfor appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                     December 22, 1993\n                                        \n\n          BREYER, Chief  Judge.  Appellants  Arce Ramos  and\n                              \n\nCruz Santiago, convicted bank robbers, raise one question in\n\nrespect to  their sentencing.  They say  that the sentencing\n\ncourt should not  have counted, as a  robbery-related \"loss\"\n\nfor sentencing  purposes,  the  value  of a  car,  a  Nissan\n\nSentra, that the robbers seized at gunpoint outside the bank\n\nand drove from  the scene of  the crime to a  second getaway\n\ncar.  We think the district court was correct to include the\n\nvalue of the  car in calculating the loss,  and we therefore\n\naffirm.\n\n          The  appellants concede  the  basic  facts.   Arce\n\nRamos, along with  two other persons,  entered a bank,  took\n\n$6,160,  shot the assistant  manager, ran outside  the bank,\n\nsaw a Nissan  Sentra that happened to be  passing by, forced\n\nits  innocent driver  out  of the  car, and  drove off  to a\n\nrendezvous  point.    A  private  security  guard,  who  had\n\nfollowed the bank robbers, saw  them park the Sentra and get\n\ninto a yellow Volkswagen,  where two confederates (including\n\nappellant  Cruz Santiago) were waiting.  All five then drove\n\noff in the Volkswagen, in  which the police later found, and\n\narrested, them.\n\n          The  sentencing  court  noted  that  the  relevant\n\nguideline, the  robbery  guideline,  determines  a  sentence\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\npartly  on  the  basis  of  a  monetary  loss  table,  which\n\ninstructs the  court to increase  the offense level  by \"one\n\nlevel\" if the  loss was more than $10,000 but  not more than\n\n$50,000.  U.S.S.G.    2B3.1(b)(6)(B).  The  court added that\n\none level because it added  the Sentra's $4,000 value to the\n\n$6,160 taken in the robbery, yielding a total \"loss\" of just\n\nover $10,000.  The appellants argue that the court ought not\n\nto have  included the  Sentra's value  in this  calculation;\n\nand,  they say,  the court  would have  (though it  need not\n\nhave)  imposed a lesser sentence had the final offense level\n\nbeen lower by  one.  Because the  court did not say  that it\n\nwould have  picked the  same  sentence from  the lower  (but\n\noverlapping) sentencing range, we assume that the difference\n\nin calculation would have made a difference to the sentence.\n\nAnd,  we  proceed  to consider  appellants'  argument.   See\n                                                            \n\nUnited States  v.  Ortiz, 966  F.2d  707, 717-18  (1st  Cir.\n                        \n\n1992), cert.  denied, 113  S. Ct.  1005  (1993); cf.  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 952-53 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                 \n\n          The  appellants' argument is  a simple one.   They\n\nnote that the  robbery guideline Commentary tells  the court\n\nthat \"[v]aluation of loss is discussed in the Commentary\" to\n\nthe  guideline  entitled  \"Larceny, Embezzlement  and  Other\n\nForms of  Theft.\"  They  concede that this  latter guideline\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ndefines \"loss\" as  including \"the value of  property taken.\"\n                                                          \n\nU.S.S.G.    2B1.1, comment.  (n.2) (emphasis  added).   And,\n\nthey concede that they took the Sentra.  But, in their view,\n                           \n\nthe court must read the  word \"taken\" as embodying a special\n\nmeaning,  derived   from  the   common  law   definition  of\n\n\"larceny,\"  namely,  \"taken   with  intent  permanently   to\n\ndeprive.\"  And, they say they did not intend to  deprive its\n\nowner of his Sentra permanently.  (After all, they parked it\n                               \n\nbefore  they  got into  the  yellow Volkswagen.)    For this\n\nreason, they conclude, the \"loss\" was $6,160, not $10,160.\n\n          We  disagree with appellants.   For one  thing, on\n\ntheir own reasoning,  the facts offer sufficient  support of\n\nthe district court's apparently implicit conclusion that the\n\nSentra's  taking  met  most  criminal  law   definitions  of\n\n\"larceny.\"  Although there is some dispute among authorities\n\nwhether common law larceny requires an intent permanently to\n\ndeprive an owner of his property,  see S. Rep. No. 307, 97th\n                                      \n\nCong., 1st Sess.  at 714 (1981),  it has long been  the case\n\nthat  \"if one takes  another's property intending  to use it\n\nrecklessly and  then abandon it,  the obstacles to  its safe\n\nreturn are such that the taker possesses the required intent\n\nto  steal.\"   2  Wayne R.  LaFave  &amp; Austin  W.  Scott, Jr.,\n\nSubstantive Criminal Law   8.5, at 360-61 (1986).\n                        \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          Some   states  say   that   a  defendant   who  is\n\nindifferent or reckless in respect to an owner's recovery of\n\nproperty is \"willing\"  to have the  owner lose his  property\n\npermanently,  and,  for  that  reason,  \"the  wrongdoer  may\n\nappropriately  be held to entertain specific intent that the\n\ndeprivation to the  owner be permanent.\"   State v.  Gordon,\n                                                           \n\n321 A.2d 352,  358 (Me. 1974);  see also State v.  Webb, 308\n                                                       \n\nS.E.2d 252,  256-57 (N.C. 1983)  (defendant's actions  would\n\nleave owner's recovery  \"to mere chance and  thus constitute\n\nsuch  'reckless exposure to loss' that it is consistent only\n\nwith  an intent  permanently  to deprive  the  owner of  his\n\nproperty\" (quoting State v. Smith, 150 S.E.2d 194, 200 (N.C.\n                                 \n\n1966)).\n\n          The criminal codes in other states  define larceny\n\n(or  theft)  to include  an  \"intent to  deprive,\"  and then\n\ndefine \"deprive\" as  including disposition of property  in a\n\nway that makes  it unlikely that the owner  will recover it.\n\nSee, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat.   53a-118(a)(3); Mont. Code Ann.\n         \n\n   45-2-101(19)(d); N.Y. Penal  Law   155.00[3];  Tex.

See, e.g., State v. Piscattano, 352 A.2d\n                                                  \n\n783,  785 (Conn. Super.  Ct. 1976) (factfinder  may conclude\n\nrecovery not  likely when  car left on  street with  keys in\n\ncar); Brown  v. State,  804 S.W.2d 566,  570 (Tex.  Ct. App.\n                     \n\n1991) (jury may  find \"intent\" permanently to  deprive where\n\ndefendant  parked and abandoned  vehicle in vacant  lot with\n\nwindows down); see also State v. Ward, 10 P. 133 (Nev. 1886)\n                                     \n\n(factfinder may find larceny when defendant abandoned horses\n\n12 miles from home, though they walked back to their barn).\n\n          The robbers here, at the  time they first took the\n\nNissan,  subjected it to  significant, known risks  that the\n\nowner would not recover it.  As the sentencing court pointed\n\nout,  the robbers  might have  \"had an  accident\" in  a high\n\nspeed chase, \"crashed the car,\"  or the car might have \"been\n\nriddled  by bullets\" shot  by pursuing police.   The robbers\n\nabandoned  the car,  on the  street, some distance  from the\n\nbank.    To  take a  car  unlawfully,  knowing (and  thereby\n\nintending)  that it  be subject  to  these risks  of further\n\ndestruction and  theft would seem  to amount to  acting with\n\nsufficient conscious  disregard in  respect to  the risk  of\n\neventual  non-recovery that  a  trier  of  fact  might  find\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ntraditional (larcenous)  theft.  See,  e.g., Piscattano, 352\n                                                       \n\nA.2d at 785.\n\n          Regardless,  the  Guidelines  do   not  limit  the\n\nCommentary's  word  \"taken\"  to  circumstances  involving  a\n\n\"permanent\" deprivation of property.  The Commentary relates\n          \n\nto an entire  guideline, the title of which  makes clear its\n\napplication, not only to larceny, but also to \"embezzlement\"\n\nand  to  \"other  forms of  theft.\"    Embezzlement  need not\n\ninvolve an intent to deprive permanently.  See, e.g., United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v.

But, we have\n\nno doubt  that  the Guidelines  intend  this result.    They\n\nspecifically provide that \"loss is  the value of the vehicle\n\neven if  the vehicle is recovered immediately.\"   The reason\n\nis that the  Guidelines here are concerned  with punishment,\n\nnot  restitution; and, they  consequently focus on  the fact\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthat the offender's  behavior created a significant  risk of\n                                                         \n\nloss  -- a  risk that  existed whether  or not  the property\n\nowner eventually suffered harm.

They say that the sentencing court should not have counted, as a robbery-related \"loss\" for sentencing purposes, the value of a car, a Nissan Sentra, that the robbers seized at gunpoint outside the bank and drove from the scene of the crime to a second getaway car.  We think the district court was correct to include the value of the car in calculating the loss, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants concede the basic facts.  Arce Ramos, along with two other persons, entered a bank, took $6,160, shot the assistant manager, ran outside the bank, saw a Nissan Sentra that happened to be passing by, forced its innocent driver out of the car, and drove off to a rendezvous point.  A private security guard, who had followed the bank robbers, saw them park the Sentra and get into a yellow Volkswagen, where two confederates (including appellant Cruz Santiago) were waiting.  All five then drove off in the Volkswagen, in which the police later found, and arrested, them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court noted that the relevant guideline, the robbery guideline, determines a sentence partly on the basis of a monetary loss table, which instructs the court to increase the offense level by \"one level\" if the loss was more than $10,000 but not more than $50,000.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B3.1(b)(6)(B).  The court added that one level because it added the Sentra's $4,000 value to the $6,160 taken in the robbery, yielding a total \"loss\" of just over $10,000.  The appellants argue that the court ought not to have included the Sentra's value in this calculation;  and, they say, the court would have (though it need not have) imposed a lesser sentence had the final offense level been lower by one.  Because the court did not say that it would have picked the same sentence from the lower (but overlapping) sentencing range, we assume that the difference in calculation would have made a difference to the sentence.  And, we proceed to consider appellants' argument.  See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717-18 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993);  cf.

They note that the robbery guideline Commentary tells the court that \"[v]aluation of loss is discussed in the Commentary\" to the guideline entitled \"Larceny, Embezzlement and Other Forms of Theft.\"   They concede that this latter guideline defines \"loss\" as including \"the value of property taken.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, comment.  (n. 2) (emphasis added).  And, they concede that they took the Sentra.  But, in their view, the court must read the word \"taken\" as embodying a special meaning, derived from the common law definition of \"larceny,\" namely, \"taken with intent permanently to deprive.\"   And, they say they did not intend to deprive its owner of his Sentra permanently.  (After all, they parked it before they got into the yellow Volkswagen.)   For this reason, they conclude, the \"loss\" was $6,160, not $10,160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with appellants.  For one thing, on their own reasoning, the facts offer sufficient support of the district court's apparently implicit conclusion that the Sentra's taking met most criminal law definitions of \"larceny.\"   Although there is some dispute among authorities whether common law larceny requires an intent permanently to deprive an owner of his property, see S.Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. at 714 (1981), it has long been the case that \"if one takes another's property intending to use it recklessly and then abandon it, the obstacles to its safe return are such that the taker possesses the required intent to steal.\"   2 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 8.5, at 360-61 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some states say that a defendant who is indifferent or reckless in respect to an owner's recovery of property is \"willing\" to have the owner lose his property permanently, and, for that reason, \"the wrongdoer may appropriately be held to entertain specific intent that the deprivation to the owner be permanent.\"  State v. Gordon, 321 A.2d 352, 358 (Me.1974);  see also State v. Webb, 309 N.C. 549, 308 S.E.2d 252, 256-57 (1983) (defendant's actions would leave owner's recovery \"to mere chance and thus constitute such 'reckless exposure to loss' that it is consistent only with an intent permanently to deprive the owner of his property\" (quoting State v. Smith, 268 N.C. 167, 150 S.E.2d 194, 200 (1966)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal codes in other states define larceny (or theft) to include an \"intent to deprive,\" and then define \"deprive\" as including disposition of property in a way that makes it unlikely that the owner will recover it.  See, e.g., Conn.Gen.Stat. Sec. 53a-118(a)(3);  Mont.Code Ann. Sec. 45-2-101(19)(d);  N.Y. Penal Law Sec. 155.00;  Tex.  Penal Code Ann. Sec. 31.01(3)(C);  see also Model Penal Code Sec. 223.0(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, courts often find the requisite \"larcenous\" intent where the evidence shows no more than the abandonment of property under circumstances that make the owner's recovery unlikely.  See, e.g., State v. Piscattano, 32 Conn.Supp. 649, 352 A.2d 783, 785 (1976) (factfinder may conclude recovery not likely when car left on street with keys in car);  Brown v. State, 804 S.W.2d 566, 570 (Tex.Ct.App.1991) (jury may find \"intent\" permanently to deprive where defendant parked and abandoned vehicle in vacant lot with windows down);  see also State v. Ward, 19 Nev. 297, 10 P. 133 (1886) (factfinder may find larceny when defendant abandoned horses 12 miles from home, though they walked back to their barn).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The robbers here, at the time they first took the Nissan, subjected it to significant, known risks that the owner would not recover it.  As the sentencing court pointed out, the robbers might have \"had an accident\" in a high speed chase, \"crashed the car,\" or the car might have \"been riddled by bullets\" shot by pursuing police.  The robbers abandoned the car, on the street, some distance from the bank.  To take a car unlawfully, knowing (and thereby intending) that it be subject to these risks of further destruction and theft would seem to amount to acting with sufficient conscious disregard in respect to the risk of eventual non-recovery that a trier of fact might find traditional (larcenous) theft.  See, e.g., Piscattano, 352 A.2d at 785.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless, the Guidelines do not limit the Commentary's word \"taken\" to circumstances involving a \"permanent \" deprivation of property.  The Commentary relates to an entire guideline, the title of which makes clear its application, not only to larceny, but also to \"embezzlement\" and to \"other forms of theft.\"   Embezzlement need not involve an intent to deprive permanently.  See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 850 F.2d 563, 565 (9th Cir.1988) (intent to deprive permanently is not an element of embezzlement);  United States v. Shackleford, 777 F.2d 1141, 1143 (6th Cir.1985) (same), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1119, 106 S.Ct. 1981, 90 L.Ed.2d 663 (1986);  United States v. Waronek, 582 F.2d 1158, 1161 n. 4 (7th Cir.1978) (same).  Nor is there a \"permanent deprivation\" requirement found in respect to such \"other forms of theft,\" as \"joyriding,\" which the law of Puerto Rico, like that of several states, criminalizes along with larceny and without distinction.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 33, Sec. 4272 (theft statute similarly prohibits permanent and temporary deprivations);  Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 16-8-1(1) (same);  S.D. Codified Laws Ann. Sec. 22-1-2(12) (same);  Wash.Rev.Code Sec. 9A.56.020(1) (same);  cf. Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 163-64, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2224-25, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (discussing state law that regarded joyriding as a lesser included offense of larceny);  State v. Reeves, 342 So.2d 605, 608 (La.1977) (same);  Commonwealth v. Giannino, 371 Mass. 700, 358 N.E.2d 1008, 1010 (1977) (same);  Model Penal Code art. 223, Sec. 223.9 (discussing unauthorized use of motor vehicles in section on \"Theft and Related Offenses\");  see also United States v. Deggs, 632 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir.1980) (discussing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1707, referred to by the theft guideline, as a \"joyriding\" statute that requires no intent to deprive permanently);  United States v. Henry, 447 F.2d 283, 284-85 (3d Cir.1971) (discussing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 661 as a theft statute that requires no intent to deprive permanently);  S.Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. at 714 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the Guidelines' similar treatment of permanent and temporary takings means that an offender's punishment will reflect the full value of a \"taken\" car returned to its owner undamaged.  But, we have no doubt that the Guidelines intend this result.  They specifically provide that \"loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.\"   The reason is that the Guidelines here are concerned with punishment, not restitution;  and, they consequently focus on the fact that the offender's behavior created a significant risk of loss--a risk that existed whether or not the property owner eventually suffered harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Brach, 942 F.2d 141, 143 (2d Cir.1991);  United States v. Cockerham, 919 F.2d 286, 289 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v.

And, in this case, both temporary loss and a significant risk of serious (permanent) loss are present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

But, we have no doubt that the Guidelines intend this result.  They specifically provide that \"loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.\"   The reason is that the Guidelines here are concerned with punishment, not restitution;  and, they consequently focus on the fact that the offender's behavior created a significant risk of loss--a risk that existed whether or not the property owner eventually suffered harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Brach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566813\"><a href=\"/opinion/566813/united-states-v-jacob-brach-also-known-as-jack-also-known-as-jack-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 143 (2d Cir.1991);  United States v.

And, in this case, both temporary loss and a significant risk of serious (permanent) loss are present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
