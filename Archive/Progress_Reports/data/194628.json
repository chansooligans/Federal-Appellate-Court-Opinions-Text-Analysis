In this appeal, we confront  two\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nissues of novel  impression at  the appellate level.   First,  we\n\nmust determine  whether the Interstate Horseracing  Act (IHA), 15\n\nU.S.C.    3001-3007 (1988), the full text of which is  set out in\n\nthe appendix,  contains  an implied  private right  of action  in\n\nfavor of  racetracks situated  within sixty  miles  of a  display\n\ntrack, i.e., a track that accepts  interstate off-track wagers on\n           \n\nraces to be run at distant  tracks and then simulcasts the actual\n\nraces.    Second,  we  must  determine  whether  certain  alleged\n\nviolations of the IHA comprise a pattern of racketeering activity\n\nfalling within the ambit of  the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act  (RICO), 18 U.S.C.     1961-1968 (1988  &amp; Supp.\n\nIII  1991).  Believing, as we do,  that the court below correctly\n\nanswered both inquiries in the negative, we affirm.\n\nI.  AT THE STARTING GATE\n\n          The  relevant facts  are  not in  dispute.   Plaintiff-\n\nappellant   Sterling   Suffolk  Racecourse   Limited  Partnership\n\n(Suffolk) conducts live horseracing at  Suffolk Downs, a track in\n\nthe metropolitan Boston area.  Approximately fifty miles away, in\n\nLincoln,  Rhode  Island,  defendant-appellee Burrillville  Racing\n\nAssociation, Inc. (Lincoln) operates  a greyhound track  (Lincoln\n\nGreyhound Park)  and an  off-track betting  (OTB) office, see  15\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.   3002(8), for, inter alia, accepting interstate off-track\n                                 \n\nwagers, see  15 U.S.C.    3002(3).   This  means, in short,  that\n           \n\nLincoln  accepts bets on horseraces  to be run  at distant tracks\n\nand, employing  telephone and wire  linkages, effectively  places\n\n                                3\n\nthese wagers in the host track's parimutuel pool.  When a race is\n\nrun, closed  circuit  television transmission  enables  Lincoln's\n\npatrons  to witness it.   Lincoln then settles  with the bettors,\n\npays a percentage to the host track, and retains the balance.\n\n          While this form of wagering is legal under the relevant\n\nlaws of all states  involved here, 15 U.S.C.    3004(a) prohibits\n\nsuch wagering at OTB  offices unless three parties consent:   (1)\n\nthe track which conducts the live race; (2) the racing commission\n\nhaving jurisdiction to regulate racing within the state where the\n\nlive  race   occurs;  and   (3)  the  racing   commission  having\n\njurisdiction over race wagering in  the state where the simulcast\n\noccurs.1  The host  racing association, in turn, must  obtain the\n\nconsent  of  the trade  association  representing  the owners  of\n\nhorses   running  in   the  live   race  before   signalling  its\n\nacquiescence.2   See id.   Lincoln procures the  consent of these\n                        \n\nparties for every race on which it accepts wagers.\n\n          A  separate subsection  of  the IHA  also requires  OTB\n\noffices to obtain the approval of \"all currently operating tracks\n\nwithin 60  miles\" or, if there  are no such tracks,  \"the closest\n\ncurrently operating  track in  an adjoining  State,\" 15  U.S.C.  \n\n3004(b)(1), before accepting interstate  off-track wagers.  It is\n\n                    \n\n     1In the parlance of the IHA, these three entities are called\nthe  \"host  racing association,\"  \"host  racing commission,\"  and\n\"off-track  racing commission,\"  respectively.   See 15  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n3002(9)-(11).   We refer the reader to the statutory appendix for\nmore precise definitions of each term.\n\n     2The  trade association  is  called the  \"horsemen's group.\"\nSee 15 U.S.C.   3002(12).\n   \n\n                                4\n\nno  secret  that Lincoln  regularly  violates  this provision  by\n\naccepting wagers against Suffolk's wishes.3\n\n          Disgruntled at being shut  out in this fashion, Suffolk\n\nsued Lincoln in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof  Rhode Island.   It  sought to  curtail Lincoln's  practice of\n\naccepting wagers  on races run  at out-of-state tracks.   Suffolk\n\nadvanced  two  theories, asseverating  that  Lincoln's activities\n\ntransgressed the IHA and also constituted a pattern of indictable\n\nactivity  under federal  gambling laws,  see, e.g.,  18 U.S.C.   \n                                                  \n\n1084(a) (1988), and, therefore, justified injunctive relief under\n\nRICO.  See  18 U.S.C.     1961(1), 1962(a).   The district  court\n          \n\nrejected  this two-pronged assault.  It  held that Suffolk lacked\n\nstanding  to  assert a  claim under  the  IHA and  that Lincoln's\n\nacceptance  of  interstate  off-track  wagers  without  Suffolk's\n\nblessing  was not  the  stuff from  which  a RICO  suit  could be\n\nfashioned.   See Sterling Suffolk Racecourse  Ltd. Partnership v.\n                                                              \n\nBurrillville Racing Ass'n, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 662, 669-71 (D.R.I.\n                               \n\n1992).   Hence, the  district court  denied Suffolk's  prayer for\n\ninjunctive  relief  and  granted  Lincoln's  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment.  Id. at 673.  This appeal ensued.\n              \n\nII.  OFF AND RUNNING\n\n          We  devote  our  initial  explicatory  efforts  to  the\n\nleading question in  the case:  Does the  IHA give so-called \"60-\n\nmile tracks,\" i.e., tracks operating within sixty miles of an OTB\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     3In December  1991, Lincoln  sought Suffolk's  approval, but\nmade  no sufficiently spectacular bid.  Hence, the parties failed\nto reach an accord.\n\n                                5\n\noffice,  an  implied  right  of  action  for  injunctive  relief?\n\nBecause this issue is purely legal, we consider it de novo.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Liberty Mutual Ins.  Co. v. Commercial Union Ins.  Co., 978\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          In  determining whether  a private  cause of  action is\n\nimplied in a federal statute, a court's central focus  must be on\n\ncongressional intent.  See, e.g., Karahalios v. National Fed'n of\n                                                                 \n\nFed.  Employees, 489  U.S.  527, 532-33  (1989)  (\"Unless .  .  .\n               \n\ncongressional intent  can be  inferred from  the language  of the\n\nstatute,  the  statutory structure,  or  some  other source,  the\n\nessential predicate  for implication  of a private  remedy simply\n\ndoes  not   exist.\")  (citation  and   internal  quotation  marks\n\nomitted); Stowell v. Ives,  976 F.2d 65, 70  n.5 (1st Cir.  1992)\n                         \n\n(\"There is a  presumption against  implied rights of  action    a\n\npresumption  that  will  endure  unless  the  plaintiff  proffers\n\nadequate  evidence of  a  contrary congressional  intent.\").   To\n\ndiscern  this  intent,  courts  employ  the  customary  tools  of\n\nstatutory  interpretation, see, e.g.,  Thompson v.  Thompson, 484\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 174,  179 (1988); Touche Ross  &amp; Co. v. Redington,  442 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n560, 575-76 (1979),  frequently asking, however,  three questions\n\nwhich  often have  special  salience in  connection with  implied\n\nrights of action.  These queries are: (1) Is the plaintiff one of\n\nthe class for whose especial benefit the legislation was enacted?\n\n(2) Is  the remedy sought consistent with the underlying purposes\n\nof the  legislative  scheme?   (3)  Is the  cause of  action  one\n\ntraditionally  relegated to state law?  See Thompson, 484 U.S. at\n                                                    \n\n                                6\n\n179;  Cort v.  Ash, 422  U.S.  66, 78  (1975); Latinos  Unidos de\n                                                                 \n\nChelsea v. Secretary of HUD, 799 F.2d 774, 792 (1st Cir. 1986).4\n                           \n\n          Here,   the  district   court  followed   this  roadmap\n\nexpertly.  See Sterling, 802 F. Supp. at 666-69.   Its opinion is\n                       \n\nastute.   Its views  are articulated with  clarity and precision.\n\nIt builds  upon other persuasively reasoned  caselaw reaching the\n\nidentical  result.    See,  e.g.,  New  Suffolk  Downs  Corp.  v.\n                                                             \n\nRockingham  Venture, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 1190, 1194 (D.N.H. 1987).\n                         \n\nUnder these auspicious circumstances,  we see no need to reinvent\n\nthe wheel.   Rather, we affirm the lower court's holding that the\n\nIHA implies no private right of action in favor of 60-mile tracks\n\nfor  essentially the reasons elucidated in the opinion below.  We\n\npause, however, to add some observations and clarifications.\n\n          First:   Although we concur in  Judge Lagueux's bottom-\n          First:\n               \n\nline  assessment  that the  IHA does  not  give 60-mile  tracks a\n\nprivate right of action, and in  his related evaluation of two of\n\nthe  three Cort factors   the  remedy that Suffolk seeks seems to\n               \n\nbe at  odds with the IHA's  underlying purposes and  the cause of\n\naction questions what activities may lawfully be carried out at a\n\nstate-regulated   gambling   facility,  a   matter  traditionally\n\n                    \n\n     4To  be sure, the Cort  Court also asked  a fourth question:\n                           \nIs  there  evidence of  legislative intent  to  create or  deny a\nprivate right  of action?   See Cort,  422 U.S. at  78; see  also\n                                                                 \nLatinos Unidos,  799 F.2d at 792.   The Justices  have since made\n              \nclear, however, that the  fourth question is really a  tote board\nfor  tallying  the  answers  to  all  the  other  inquiries  and,\ntherefore, need not be considered separately.   See Thompson, 484\n                                                            \nU.S. at 179; California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 293 (1981);\n                                      \nsee  also Royal Business Group,  Inc. v. Realist,  Inc., 933 F.2d\n                                                       \n1056, 1060 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                7\n\nrelegated to state  law   we  think it is  advisable to begin  by\n\nremarking  a point of disagreement.  Unlike Judge Lagueux, 802 F.\n\nSupp. at 667, we believe Congress, even though  it did not choose\n\nto  confer a  private right  of action,  see  infra, nevertheless\n                                                   \n\ndesigned section 3004(b)(1)(A) for the benefit of 60-mile tracks.\n\nSee Cort, 422 U.S. at 78;  see also Royal Business Group, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nRealist, Inc., 933 F.2d 1056, 1061-62 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing\n             \n\n\"especial benefit\" test).\n\n          The especial benefit inquiry in implied right of action\n\ncases need not be a search for a single class of plaintiffs   the\n\nclass which the entire statute is most directed toward assisting.\n\nRather, different parts  of a  statutory scheme can  be aimed  at\n\nbenefitting different classes  of persons.   See, e.g., Cohen  v.\n                                                             \n\nMassachusetts Bay  Transp.

The inquiry,  then, focuses on whether any  language in\n                                                    \n\nthe  statute sufficiently  indicates  a motivating  congressional\n\npurpose to benefit  the class in question  as opposed to, say,  a\n\nmere  congressional expression  of  knowledge  anent, or  passive\n\napproval of,  a tangential  benefit.   See  California v.  Sierra\n                                                                 \n\nClub,  451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981); Cannon v.

Bank, 918 F.2d 276, 278 (1st Cir. 1990).\n               \n\n          When  we shine the  light of this  understanding on the\n\nIHA,  we think  that 60-mile  tracks meet the  \"especial benefit\"\n\ncriterion.    Section 3004(b)(1)(A)  requires  an  OTB office  to\n\nprocure  the  approval of  all  60-mile  tracks before  accepting\n\ninterstate off-track wagers.  This requirement, by its own terms,\n\nadequately   evinces  congressional   intent  to   safeguard  the\n\ninterests of  60-mile tracks  and, therefore,  must be  viewed as\n\nredounding to  their especial  benefit.  The  legislative history\n\nfortifies this conclusion.   See,  e.g., S. Rep.  No. 1117,  95th\n                                       \n\nCong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1978), reprinted in  1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4144,\n                                        \n\n4147-48.   No more is exigible.   See Cannon, 441  U.S. at 690-94\n                                            \n\n(finding especial benefit conferred by language more general than\n\nthat contained in the IHA).\n\n          Still, we hasten to  add that this fact alone  does not\n\nstrike the gold.   In this case, the especial  benefit element is\n\nat  most  a  dim  counterpoint  to  the  bold-faced  evidence  of\n\ncongressional  intent  intricately   interwoven  into  the  IHA's\n\nlanguage  and   structure.    Therefore,  the   district  court's\n\nmiscalculation constitutes harmless error.\n\n          Second:   We  turn  now  to  the  other  indicators  of\n          Second:\n                \n\nlegislative intent.  It is  a familiar precept that, in cases  of\n\nstatutory  interpretation, the  language  of the  statute  enjoys\n\n                                9\n\npreeminence.  See Northwest  Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,\n                                                                \n\n451 U.S. 77,  91 (1981); Transamerica Mortgage  Advisors, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nLewis, 444 U.S.  11, 15-16; Touche Ross, 442 U.S.  at 568.  Here,\n                                       \n\nnotwithstanding  the especial  benefit  point, the  words of  the\n\nstatute  speak  strongly  against  implying a  private  right  of\n\naction.  We explain briefly.\n\n          When a statute expressly provides remedies, courts must\n\nbe extremely reluctant to expand its sweep by augmenting the list\n\nof  prescribed  anodynes.    To   the  exact  contrary,  a  court\n\nconfronted with such a  situation should ordinarily conclude that\n\nthe legislature  provided  precisely the  redress  it  considered\n\nappropriate.  See, e.g., Karahalios, 489 U.S. at  533 (collecting\n                                   \n\ncases); Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. Sea Clammers, 453 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n1, 14-15 (1981); Nashoba Communications, Ltd. v. Town of Danvers,\n                                                                \n\n893 F.2d 435, 440 (1st Cir. 1990).  This is such a case.  The IHA\n\nexplicitly identifies  the parties entitled to  bring actions for\n\ndamages or injunctions, see 15 U.S.C.   3006   and 60-mile tracks\n                           \n\nare not among them.   When discussing the potential  liability of\n\nviolators  and outlining  the  damages  they  must pay,  the  IHA\n\nidentifies as  potential recipients  of damage awards  only these\n\nsame parties.  See 15 U.S.C.    3005.  And, moreover, the statute\n                  \n\nemploys a damage  calculation formula, see  id., that is  totally\n                                               \n\nirrelevant to entities like 60-mile tracks.  It strains credulity\n\nto argue that these serial omissions are serendipitous.\n\n          The IHA's venue and jurisdictional provisions  point in\n\nthe   same  direction.    The  statute  provides  that  venue  is\n\n                                10\n\nappropriate only in a district in which either the host track  or\n\nthe  display track  is located.   See  15 U.S.C.    3007(b).   It\n                                     \n\nfurther  provides that  jurisdiction is  appropriate only  in the\n\ncourts of the host state or the off-track state.5   See 15 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n\n   3007(c).  In particular  contexts, a statute's  silence can be\n\ninformative.   So it is here:   the absence of  any provision for\n\nvenue or jurisdiction based  on the location of an  aggrieved 60-\n\nmile track tells a tale.\n\n          In  sum, given the language  of the statute    what the\n\nIHA says and  what it shies away  from saying   there is  no sure\n\nfooting for the implication of a private right of action favoring\n\nnon-consenting 60-mile tracks.\n\n          Third:    The structure  of a  statute  can also  be of\n          Third:\n               \n\ninestimable value in its interpretation.   See Crandon v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  110  S. Ct.  997, 1001  (1990);  Greenwood Trust  Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nMassachusetts, 971 F.2d 818,  824 (1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. 974 (1993).  In this instance, the statute's structure\n\nseems highly significant.  The provision requiring OTB offices to\n\nsecure  the  approbation of  the  horsemen's  group, host  racing\n\nassociation,   host  racing  commission,   and  off-track  racing\n\ncommission  is  set  conspicuously   apart  from  the   provision\n\nrequiring  display tracks to seek the approval of 60-mile tracks.\n\nCompare 15 U.S.C.   3004(a) with 15 U.S.C.   3004(b).\n                                \n\n          The language of  the statutory provisions bolsters  the\n\n                    \n\n     5The \"off-track State\" is the state in which the \"interstate\noff-track wager is accepted.\"  15 U.S.C.   3002(6).\n\n                                11\n\nconclusion that  these structural  differences are  pregnant with\n\nmeaning.   Congress phrased the  former provision as  an absolute\n\ncondition precedent to off-track wagering across state lines, see\n                                                                 \n\n15 U.S.C.     3004(a)  (an \"interstate  off-track  wager  may  be\n\naccepted  by  an  off-track  betting system  only  if  consent is\n                                                     \n\nobtained  from [four entities]\") (emphasis supplied), but phrased\n\nthe  latter provision merely as  a directive to  a private party.\n\nSee 15 U.S.C.    3004(b)(1) (\"any off-track betting  office shall\n   \n\nobtain  the approval of [tracks  within a 60-mile  radius]\").  As\n\nthe  Court  has indicated,  a  statutory provision  phrased  as a\n\ncommand to specific people, like the one upon which Suffolk rests\n\nits  hopes,  is unlikely  to breed  an  implied private  right of\n\naction  because  such language  usually  evinces a  congressional\n\nconcern with  instructing the putative violator  rather than with\n\nproviding  a  remedy  to   the  putative  victim.    See,   e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUniversities Research Ass'n v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, 772-73 &amp; n.23\n                                    \n\n(1981); Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690-93.\n              \n\n          Fourth:  In this  case, the whole is certainly  no less\n          Fourth:\n                \n\nthan the  sum of its constituent  parts.  The language  of almost\n\nevery  section of  the  IHA, and  the  structure of  the  pivotal\n\nprovisions,  strongly suggest  that  Congress did  not intend  to\n\nprovide  disapproving  60-mile tracks  with  a  private right  of\n\naction against display tracks.   Having discerned so striking  an\n\nindication of  congressional intent, deeply rooted in the text of\n\nthe  statute itself,  we find  Suffolk's reliance  on fragmentary\n\nexcerpts  from the  legislative history  to  be little  more than\n\n                                12\n\ngrains  of desert  sand in  the teeth  of a  haboob.   Even clear\n\nlegislative  history   and the history here is less than pellucid\n\n   must yield to a  contrary implication easily  derivable from a\n\nstatute's text.   See Puerto  Rico Dep't of  Consumer Affairs  v.\n                                                             \n\nIsla  Petroleum  Corp., 485  U.S. 495,  501  (1988); see  also 2A\n                                                              \n\nNorman J.  Singer, Sutherland  Statutory  Construction     46.04,\n                                                      \n\n46.07  (5th ed.  1992) (concluding  that courts,  when construing\n\nstatutes, must adhere primarily to language and structure).\n\n          Fifth:   We  reject  appellant's plea  that denying  an\n          Fifth:\n               \n\nimplied  right  of  action  will render  nugatory  the  statutory\n\nprovisions dealing  with  60-mile tracks.   Appellant's  reliance\n\nupon a finding  of especial benefit, see supra  pp. 6-8, to prove\n                                              \n\nthis  point  is misplaced.    That Congress  purposely  sought to\n\nconfer a benefit  on entities  like Suffolk does  not imply  that\n\nsuch was the only   or  even the overriding   motive for enacting\n\nthe  statute.  See, e.g., Cort, 422  U.S. at 81-82 &amp; n.13; Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n647  F.2d at 212.  Nor  does Congress's intent to benefit 60-mile\n\ntracks inevitably imply  that Congress deemed a  private right of\n\naction  to be a necessary or advisable means of accomplishing its\n\ngoal.  See  Coutu, 450 U.S.  at 771 (explaining that  \"[t]he fact\n                 \n\nthat  an enactment is designed to benefit a particular class does\n\nnot end the  inquiry; instead it must  also be asked whether  the\n\nlanguage of the statute indicates that Congress  intended that it\n\nbe  enforced  through private  litigation\"); accord  Daily Income\n                                                                 \n\nFund, Inc. v.

Cf., e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nAlabama  Sportservice, Inc.  v.

Similarly,  display\n\ntracks  and  60-mile tracks  are frequently  located in  the same\n\nstate and,  therefore, subject to the  same regulatory authority.\n\nWhere  that  occurs, the  IHA has  the  effect of  permitting the\n\nracing commission either to insist on pre-approval or to work out\n\nsome other satisfactory solution.  Even when a 60-mile track does\n\nnot  have  this  home   field  advantage,  the  off-track  racing\n\ncommission  may  well  be  persuaded to  take  regulatory  action\n\nagainst  a display track  which, like  Lincoln, scorns  a federal\n\n                    \n\n     6Lincoln  itself has  been hoist  on this  petard.

Cf.,  e.g., CBS  Inc.  v. FCC,  453  U.S. 367,  373-75\n                                        \n\n(1981); FCC v.

It merely ensures  that negotiations for  a green light\n\nfrom  market-area  tracks  will  occur in  the  context  Congress\n\nenvisioned, with neither party  completely beholden to the other.\n\nAfter all,  were we to  infer a right  of action along  the lines\n\nthat  Suffolk  delineates,  we   would  hand  60-mile  tracks  an\n\nimportant veto  power over  the operation  of nearby  OTB offices\n\nand, in  the  bargain,  tilt  the delicate  balance  Congress  so\n\npainstakingly constructed.\n\n          We  will not  belabor  the point.    In the  long  run,\n\nCongress may well have thought that the indirect benefits flowing\n\nfrom a right of approval that  had little bite were preferable to\n\nthe potential vices involved in granting 60-mile tracks the right\n\nto  gnaw at  will.

Mashaw, Textualism,\n                                                                 \n\nConstitutionalism, and the Interpretation of Federal Statutes, 32\n                                                             \n\nWm.  &amp;  Mary L.

THE HOME STRETCH\n\n          We  turn  next,  albeit  briefly, to  the  question  of\n\nwhether  appellant, on  these  facts, framed  a cognizable  claim\n\nunder the RICO statute.  Suffolk argues that Lincoln's unapproved\n\nacceptance of wagers constitutes a pattern of indictable activity\n\nunder  federal gambling  laws and,  therefore, violates  the RICO\n\nstatute.   The court below did  not agree.  See  Sterling, 802 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  at 669-70.   We think  the lower  court reached  the right\n\nresult:  Lincoln's acceptance of wagers on distant races  without\n\nSuffolk's consent does not constitute a crime which can carry the\n\nweight of a RICO complaint.7\n\n          RICO targets the use, in connection with any enterprise\n\naffecting interstate commerce, of  income derived \"from a pattern\n\nof  racketeering activity.\"    18 U.S.C.     1962(a).   The  term\n\n\"racketeering  activity\"  is  defined  in 18  U.S.C.     1961(1).\n\nIncluded  in the definition is any act indictable under 18 U.S.C.\n\n  1084, a statute which  criminalizes, inter alia, utilization of\n                                                 \n\na  wire  facility  for the  \"transmission  in  interstate  . .  .\n\ncommerce of  . . . information assisting in the placing of bets .\n\n. .  on any sporting  event.\"  18  U.S.C.   1084(a).   Conceding,\n\nwithal,  that  wagering  of  the  sort  transacted  at  Lincoln's\n\nfacility is permissible under the relevant laws of all interested\n\nstates, appellant pins its RICO-related hopes on section 1084(a).\n\n                    \n\n     7Here, again, the issue is purely legal and appellate review\nis plenary.\n\n                                16\n\nBut,  section  1084(a)  carves   out  a  specific  exception  for\n\ncircumstances in which wagering  on a sporting event is  legal in\n\nboth the sending state and the  receiving state.  See 18 U.S.C.  \n                                                     \n\n1084(b).  That exception applies here.\n\n          Leaving  the IHA to  one side,  appellant has  no case.\n\nThe legislative history of section 1084 shows beyond peradventure\n\nthat Congress enacted section 1084(b) for  the express purpose of\n\nallowing  off-track  betting  in  venues where  states  chose  to\n\nlegalize such  activity (thereby  reserving to  individual states\n\nsome measure of control  over what forms of gambling  could occur\n\nwithin their borders).

(1961),  reprinted  in  1961  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2631, 2632-33.\n                             \n\nThus, given that the  operation of Lincoln's OTB office  does not\n\noffend relevant state law, we  have no non-IHA-related reason  to\n\ndeclare that  the actions complained  of in this  suit constitute\n\nindictable conduct under section 1084.\n\n          Appellant  tells us  that the  IHA makes  a dispositive\n\ndifference.  But, we do not understand how this can be true.  All\n\navailable evidence  indicates that  Congress intended the  IHA to\n\nhave  purely  civil  consequences.     For  instance,  the  IHA's\n\nenforcement  and  remedies   sections  specifically  exclude  the\n\npossibility  of governmental  involvement and/or  the specter  of\n\ncriminal penalties.  See  15 U.S.C.     3005, 3006.  The  section\n                        \n\ndealing  with  jurisdiction  and  venue  refers  only  to  \"civil\n\naction[s].\"  15 U.S.C.    3007.  The legislative  history teaches\n\nthat Congress intended there to \"be no Government enforcement\" of\n\n                                17\n\nthe  IHA; and  further intended that  \"[a]ny person  accepting an\n\ninterstate  wager other  than  in conformity  with  the act  will\n\ninstead be civilly liable in a private action  for damages to the\n       \n\nhost  State,  the host  racing  association,  and the  applicable\n\nhorsemen's group.\"  S.  Rep. No. 1117, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 4146\n\n(emphasis  supplied); see also H.R. Rep. No. 1733, 95th Cong., 2d\n                              \n\nSess.  3 (1978)  (same).   In the  face  of this  imposing array,\n\nSuffolk's  argument  that   the  IHA  serves  as  a   fulcrum  to\n\ncriminalize Lincoln's activities must fail.\n\n          To recapitulate,  we think  it clear that  Congress, in\n\nadopting section  1084, did not  intend to criminalize  acts that\n\nneither the  affected states nor Congress  itself deemed criminal\n\nin  nature.  Lincoln's acts fall into this chiaroscuro category  \n\nperhaps  not right, but certainly not felonious.  It follows that\n\nthese acts, not indictable  under section 1084, cannot constitute\n\na  pattern of  racketeering activity  within RICO's  definitional\n\nparameters.   Hence,  the  court below  properly granted  summary\n\njudgment on the RICO count.8\n\nIV.  AT THE WIRE\n\n          We  need  go no  further.    Simply stated,  Congress's\n\ndiscernible intent precludes us from inferring a private right of\n\n                    \n\n     8The district court held, in the alternative, that RICO does\nnot  confer  a  right to  sue  for  equitable  relief on  private\nplaintiffs and  that, therefore,  even  if Suffolk  had raised  a\ncolorable RICO claim, no  injunction could issue.  See  Sterling,\n                                                                \n802 F.  Supp. at 670-71; see  also Lincoln House, Inc.  v. Dupre,\n                                                                \n903  F.2d 845, 848 (1st  Cir. 1990) (expressing  doubts about the\navailability of such relief).  Because we affirm, without caveat,\nthe district  court's primary holding concerning  the RICO claim,\nwe do not address this alternate ground.\n\n                                18\n\naction in appellant's  favor.   Because this is  so, and  because\n\nappellant's  complaint  likewise  fails   to  limn  a  cognizable\n\nracketeering claim, the judgment  below, to invoke the name  of a\n\nvery famous racehorse, must be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                19\n",

In this appeal, we confront  two\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nissues of novel  impression at  the appellate level.   First,  we\n\nmust determine  whether the Interstate Horseracing  Act (IHA), 15\n\nU.S.C.    3001-3007 (1988), the full text of which is  set out in\n\nthe appendix,  contains  an implied  private right  of action  in\n\nfavor of  racetracks situated  within sixty  miles  of a  display\n\ntrack, i.e., a track that accepts  interstate off-track wagers on\n           \n\nraces to be run at distant  tracks and then simulcasts the actual\n\nraces.    Second,  we  must  determine  whether  certain  alleged\n\nviolations of the IHA comprise a pattern of racketeering activity\n\nfalling within the ambit of  the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act  (RICO), 18 U.S.C.     1961-1968 (1988  &amp; Supp.\n\nIII  1991).  Believing, as we do,  that the court below correctly\n\nanswered both inquiries in the negative, we affirm.\n\nI.  AT THE STARTING GATE\n\n          The  relevant facts  are  not in  dispute.   Plaintiff-\n\nappellant   Sterling   Suffolk  Racecourse   Limited  Partnership\n\n(Suffolk) conducts live horseracing at  Suffolk Downs, a track in\n\nthe metropolitan Boston area.  Approximately fifty miles away, in\n\nLincoln,  Rhode  Island,  defendant-appellee Burrillville  Racing\n\nAssociation, Inc. (Lincoln) operates  a greyhound track  (Lincoln\n\nGreyhound Park)  and an  off-track betting  (OTB) office, see  15\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.   3002(8), for, inter alia, accepting interstate off-track\n                                 \n\nwagers, see  15 U.S.C.    3002(3).   This  means, in short,  that\n           \n\nLincoln  accepts bets on horseraces  to be run  at distant tracks\n\nand, employing  telephone and wire  linkages, effectively  places\n\n                                3\n\nthese wagers in the host track's parimutuel pool.  When a race is\n\nrun, closed  circuit  television transmission  enables  Lincoln's\n\npatrons  to witness it.   Lincoln then settles  with the bettors,\n\npays a percentage to the host track, and retains the balance.\n\n          While this form of wagering is legal under the relevant\n\nlaws of all states  involved here, 15 U.S.C.    3004(a) prohibits\n\nsuch wagering at OTB  offices unless three parties consent:   (1)\n\nthe track which conducts the live race; (2) the racing commission\n\nhaving jurisdiction to regulate racing within the state where the\n\nlive  race   occurs;  and   (3)  the  racing   commission  having\n\njurisdiction over race wagering in  the state where the simulcast\n\noccurs.1  The host  racing association, in turn, must  obtain the\n\nconsent  of  the trade  association  representing  the owners  of\n\nhorses   running  in   the  live   race  before   signalling  its\n\nacquiescence.2   See id.   Lincoln procures the  consent of these\n                        \n\nparties for every race on which it accepts wagers.\n\n          A  separate subsection  of  the IHA  also requires  OTB\n\noffices to obtain the approval of \"all currently operating tracks\n\nwithin 60  miles\" or, if there  are no such tracks,  \"the closest\n\ncurrently operating  track in  an adjoining  State,\" 15  U.S.C.  \n\n3004(b)(1), before accepting interstate  off-track wagers.  It is\n\n                    \n\n     1In the parlance of the IHA, these three entities are called\nthe  \"host  racing association,\"  \"host  racing commission,\"  and\n\"off-track  racing commission,\"  respectively.   See 15  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n3002(9)-(11).   We refer the reader to the statutory appendix for\nmore precise definitions of each term.\n\n     2The  trade association  is  called the  \"horsemen's group.\"\nSee 15 U.S.C.   3002(12).\n   \n\n                                4\n\nno  secret  that Lincoln  regularly  violates  this provision  by\n\naccepting wagers against Suffolk's wishes.3\n\n          Disgruntled at being shut  out in this fashion, Suffolk\n\nsued Lincoln in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof  Rhode Island.   It  sought to  curtail Lincoln's  practice of\n\naccepting wagers  on races run  at out-of-state tracks.   Suffolk\n\nadvanced  two  theories, asseverating  that  Lincoln's activities\n\ntransgressed the IHA and also constituted a pattern of indictable\n\nactivity  under federal  gambling laws,  see, e.g.,  18 U.S.C.   \n                                                  \n\n1084(a) (1988), and, therefore, justified injunctive relief under\n\nRICO.  See  18 U.S.C.     1961(1), 1962(a).   The district  court\n          \n\nrejected  this two-pronged assault.  It  held that Suffolk lacked\n\nstanding  to  assert a  claim under  the  IHA and  that Lincoln's\n\nacceptance  of  interstate  off-track  wagers  without  Suffolk's\n\nblessing  was not  the  stuff from  which  a RICO  suit  could be\n\nfashioned.   See Sterling Suffolk Racecourse  Ltd. Partnership v.\n                                                              \n\nBurrillville Racing Ass'n, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1649888\"><a href=\"/opinion/1649888/sterling-suffolk-racecourse-v-burrillville-racing/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

OFF AND RUNNING\n\n          We  devote  our  initial  explicatory  efforts  to  the\n\nleading question in  the case:  Does the  IHA give so-called \"60-\n\nmile tracks,\" i.e., tracks operating within sixty miles of an OTB\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     3In December  1991, Lincoln  sought Suffolk's  approval, but\nmade  no sufficiently spectacular bid.

We\n\npause, however, to add some observations and clarifications.\n\n          First:   Although we concur in  Judge Lagueux's bottom-\n          First:\n               \n\nline  assessment  that the  IHA does  not  give 60-mile  tracks a\n\nprivate right of action, and in  his related evaluation of two of\n\nthe  three Cort factors   the  remedy that Suffolk seeks seems to\n               \n\nbe at  odds with the IHA's  underlying purposes and  the cause of\n\naction questions what activities may lawfully be carried out at a\n\nstate-regulated   gambling   facility,  a   matter  traditionally\n\n                    \n\n     4To  be sure, the Cort  Court also asked  a fourth question:\n                           \nIs  there  evidence of  legislative intent  to  create or  deny a\nprivate right  of action?   See Cort,  422 U.S. at  78; see  also\n                                                                 \nLatinos Unidos,  799 F.2d at 792.   The Justices  have since made\n              \nclear, however, that the  fourth question is really a  tote board\nfor  tallying  the  answers  to  all  the  other  inquiries  and,\ntherefore, need not be considered separately.   See Thompson, 484\n                                                            \nU.S. at 179; California v.

Section 3004(b)(1)(A)  requires  an  OTB office  to\n\nprocure  the  approval of  all  60-mile  tracks before  accepting\n\ninterstate off-track wagers.  This requirement, by its own terms,\n\nadequately   evinces  congressional   intent  to   safeguard  the\n\ninterests of  60-mile tracks  and, therefore,  must be  viewed as\n\nredounding to  their especial  benefit.  The  legislative history\n\nfortifies this conclusion.   See,  e.g., S. Rep.  No. 1117,  95th\n                                       \n\nCong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1978), reprinted in  1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4144,\n                                        \n\n4147-48.   No more is exigible.   See Cannon, 441  U.S. at 690-94\n                                            \n\n(finding especial benefit conferred by language more general than\n\nthat contained in the IHA).\n\n          Still, we hasten to  add that this fact alone  does not\n\nstrike the gold.   In this case, the especial  benefit element is\n\nat  most  a  dim  counterpoint  to  the  bold-faced  evidence  of\n\ncongressional  intent  intricately   interwoven  into  the  IHA's\n\nlanguage  and   structure.    Therefore,  the   district  court's\n\nmiscalculation constitutes harmless error.\n\n          Second:   We  turn  now  to  the  other  indicators  of\n          Second:\n                \n\nlegislative intent.  It is  a familiar precept that, in cases  of\n\nstatutory  interpretation, the  language  of the  statute  enjoys\n\n                                9\n\npreeminence.

We explain briefly.\n\n          When a statute expressly provides remedies, courts must\n\nbe extremely reluctant to expand its sweep by augmenting the list\n\nof  prescribed  anodynes.    To   the  exact  contrary,  a  court\n\nconfronted with such a  situation should ordinarily conclude that\n\nthe legislature  provided  precisely the  redress  it  considered\n\nappropriate.

This is such a case.  The IHA\n\nexplicitly identifies  the parties entitled to  bring actions for\n\ndamages or injunctions, see 15 U.S.C.   3006   and 60-mile tracks\n                           \n\nare not among them.   When discussing the potential  liability of\n\nviolators  and outlining  the  damages  they  must pay,  the  IHA\n\nidentifies as  potential recipients  of damage awards  only these\n\nsame parties.  See 15 U.S.C.    3005.  And, moreover, the statute\n                  \n\nemploys a damage  calculation formula, see  id., that is  totally\n                                               \n\nirrelevant to entities like 60-mile tracks.  It strains credulity\n\nto argue that these serial omissions are serendipitous.\n\n          The IHA's venue and jurisdictional provisions  point in\n\nthe   same  direction.    The  statute  provides  that  venue  is\n\n                                10\n\nappropriate only in a district in which either the host track  or\n\nthe  display track  is located.   See  15 U.S.C.    3007(b).   It\n                                     \n\nfurther  provides that  jurisdiction is  appropriate only  in the\n\ncourts of the host state or the off-track state.5   See 15 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n\n   3007(c).  In particular  contexts, a statute's  silence can be\n\ninformative.   So it is here:   the absence of  any provision for\n\nvenue or jurisdiction based  on the location of an  aggrieved 60-\n\nmile track tells a tale.\n\n          In  sum, given the language  of the statute    what the\n\nIHA says and  what it shies away  from saying   there is  no sure\n\nfooting for the implication of a private right of action favoring\n\nnon-consenting 60-mile tracks.\n\n          Third:    The structure  of a  statute  can also  be of\n          Third:\n               \n\ninestimable value in its interpretation.

The provision requiring OTB offices to\n\nsecure  the  approbation of  the  horsemen's  group, host  racing\n\nassociation,   host  racing  commission,   and  off-track  racing\n\ncommission  is  set  conspicuously   apart  from  the   provision\n\nrequiring  display tracks to seek the approval of 60-mile tracks.\n\nCompare 15 U.S.C.   3004(a) with 15 U.S.C.   3004(b).\n                                \n\n          The language of  the statutory provisions bolsters  the\n\n                    \n\n     5The \"off-track State\" is the state in which the \"interstate\noff-track wager is accepted.\"  15 U.S.C.   3002(6).\n\n                                11\n\nconclusion that  these structural  differences are  pregnant with\n\nmeaning.

As\n\nthe  Court  has indicated,  a  statutory provision  phrased  as a\n\ncommand to specific people, like the one upon which Suffolk rests\n\nits  hopes,  is unlikely  to breed  an  implied private  right of\n\naction  because  such language  usually  evinces a  congressional\n\nconcern with  instructing the putative violator  rather than with\n\nproviding  a  remedy  to   the  putative  victim.

The language  of almost\n\nevery  section of  the  IHA, and  the  structure of  the  pivotal\n\nprovisions,  strongly suggest  that  Congress did  not intend  to\n\nprovide  disapproving  60-mile tracks  with  a  private right  of\n\naction against display tracks.   Having discerned so striking  an\n\nindication of  congressional intent, deeply rooted in the text of\n\nthe  statute itself,  we find  Suffolk's reliance  on fragmentary\n\nexcerpts  from the  legislative history  to  be little  more than\n\n                                12\n\ngrains  of desert  sand in  the teeth  of a  haboob.

See, e.g., Cort, 422  U.S. at 81-82 &amp; n.13; Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n647  F.2d at 212.  Nor  does Congress's intent to benefit 60-mile\n\ntracks inevitably imply  that Congress deemed a  private right of\n\naction  to be a necessary or advisable means of accomplishing its\n\ngoal.  See  Coutu, 450 U.S.  at 771 (explaining that  \"[t]he fact\n                 \n\nthat  an enactment is designed to benefit a particular class does\n\nnot end the  inquiry; instead it must  also be asked whether  the\n\nlanguage of the statute indicates that Congress  intended that it\n\nbe  enforced  through private  litigation\"); accord  Daily Income\n                                                                 \n\nFund, Inc. v.

THE HOME STRETCH\n\n          We  turn  next,  albeit  briefly, to  the  question  of\n\nwhether  appellant, on  these  facts, framed  a cognizable  claim\n\nunder the RICO statute.  Suffolk argues that Lincoln's unapproved\n\nacceptance of wagers constitutes a pattern of indictable activity\n\nunder  federal gambling  laws and,  therefore, violates  the RICO\n\nstatute.   The court below did  not agree.  See  Sterling, 802 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  at 669-70.   We think  the lower  court reached  the right\n\nresult:  Lincoln's acceptance of wagers on distant races  without\n\nSuffolk's consent does not constitute a crime which can carry the\n\nweight of a RICO complaint.7\n\n          RICO targets the use, in connection with any enterprise\n\naffecting interstate commerce, of  income derived \"from a pattern\n\nof  racketeering activity.\"    18 U.S.C.     1962(a).   The  term\n\n\"racketeering  activity\"  is  defined  in 18  U.S.C.     1961(1).\n\nIncluded  in the definition is any act indictable under 18 U.S.C.\n\n  1084, a statute which  criminalizes, inter alia, utilization of\n                                                 \n\na  wire  facility  for the  \"transmission  in  interstate  . .  .\n\ncommerce of  . . . information assisting in the placing of bets .\n\n. .  on any sporting  event.\"  18  U.S.C.   1084(a).   Conceding,\n\nwithal,  that  wagering  of  the  sort  transacted  at  Lincoln's\n\nfacility is permissible under the relevant laws of all interested\n\nstates, appellant pins its RICO-related hopes on section 1084(a).\n\n                    \n\n     7Here, again, the issue is purely legal and appellate review\nis plenary.\n\n                                16\n\nBut,  section  1084(a)  carves   out  a  specific  exception  for\n\ncircumstances in which wagering  on a sporting event is  legal in\n\nboth the sending state and the  receiving state.  See 18 U.S.C.  \n                                                     \n\n1084(b).  That exception applies here.\n\n          Leaving  the IHA to  one side,  appellant has  no case.\n\nThe legislative history of section 1084 shows beyond peradventure\n\nthat Congress enacted section 1084(b) for  the express purpose of\n\nallowing  off-track  betting  in  venues where  states  chose  to\n\nlegalize such  activity (thereby  reserving to  individual states\n\nsome measure of control  over what forms of gambling  could occur\n\nwithin their borders).   See H.R. Rep.  No. 967, 87th Cong.,  1st\n                            \n\nSess.  (1961),  reprinted  in  1961  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2631, 2632-33.\n                             \n\nThus, given that the  operation of Lincoln's OTB office  does not\n\noffend relevant state law, we  have no non-IHA-related reason  to\n\ndeclare that  the actions complained  of in this  suit constitute\n\nindictable conduct under section 1084.\n\n          Appellant  tells us  that the  IHA makes  a dispositive\n\ndifference.  But, we do not understand how this can be true.  All\n\navailable evidence  indicates that  Congress intended the  IHA to\n\nhave  purely  civil  consequences.     For  instance,  the  IHA's\n\nenforcement  and  remedies   sections  specifically  exclude  the\n\npossibility  of governmental  involvement and/or  the specter  of\n\ncriminal penalties.  See  15 U.S.C.     3005, 3006.  The  section\n                        \n\ndealing  with  jurisdiction  and  venue  refers  only  to  \"civil\n\naction[s].\"  15 U.S.C.    3007.  The legislative  history teaches\n\nthat Congress intended there to \"be no Government enforcement\" of\n\n                                17\n\nthe  IHA; and  further intended that  \"[a]ny person  accepting an\n\ninterstate  wager other  than  in conformity  with  the act  will\n\ninstead be civilly liable in a private action  for damages to the\n       \n\nhost  State,  the host  racing  association,  and the  applicable\n\nhorsemen's group.\"  S.  Rep. No. 1117, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 4146\n\n(emphasis  supplied); see also H.R. Rep. No. 1733, 95th Cong., 2d\n                              \n\nSess.  3 (1978)  (same).   In the  face  of this  imposing array,\n\nSuffolk's  argument  that   the  IHA  serves  as  a   fulcrum  to\n\ncriminalize Lincoln's activities must fail.\n\n          To recapitulate,  we think  it clear that  Congress, in\n\nadopting section  1084, did not  intend to criminalize  acts that\n\nneither the  affected states nor Congress  itself deemed criminal\n\nin  nature.  Lincoln's acts fall into this chiaroscuro category  \n\nperhaps  not right, but certainly not felonious.  It follows that\n\nthese acts, not indictable  under section 1084, cannot constitute\n\na  pattern of  racketeering activity  within RICO's  definitional\n\nparameters.   Hence,  the  court below  properly granted  summary\n\njudgment on the RICO count.8\n\nIV.  AT THE WIRE\n\n          We  need  go no  further.    Simply stated,  Congress's\n\ndiscernible intent precludes us from inferring a private right of\n\n                    \n\n     8The district court held, in the alternative, that RICO does\nnot  confer  a  right to  sue  for  equitable  relief on  private\nplaintiffs and  that, therefore,  even  if Suffolk  had raised  a\ncolorable RICO claim, no  injunction could issue.  See  Sterling,\n                                                                \n802 F.  Supp. at 670-71; see  also Lincoln House, Inc.  v. Dupre,\n                                                                \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541943\"><a href=\"/opinion/541943/lincoln-house-inc-v-paul-w-dupre/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 848 (1st  Cir. 1990) (expressing  doubts about the\navailability of such relief).

Because this is  so, and  because\n\nappellant's  complaint  likewise  fails   to  limn  a  cognizable\n\nracketeering claim, the judgment  below, to invoke the name  of a\n\nvery famous racehorse, must be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                19\n</pre>",
