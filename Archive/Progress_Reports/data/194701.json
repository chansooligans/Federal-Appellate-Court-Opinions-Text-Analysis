Appellant,  Victor Vega-Encarnacion,\n                     \n\nwas convicted along with a co-defendant, Hector Orlando Cruz-\n\nRosario, of aiding  and abetting in the distribution  of more\n\nthan  5,000  grams of  cocaine in  violation  of 21  U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.    2.  A third  co-defendant, Roberto\n\nVazquez-Carrera, pled  guilty  prior  to  trial.    The  only\n\nwitness to testify at  trial was an undercover agent  for the\n\nDEA, Miguel  Andaluz Baez.   We  affirmed the convictions  of\n\nappellant and Cruz-Rosario on appeal.  United States v. Vega-\n                                                             \n\nEncarnacion, 914 F.2d 20  (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied,  111\n                                                       \n\nS. Ct. 1626 (1991).\n\n          Appellant has filed  a petition under  28 U.S.C.   \n\n2255  seeking  to  set  aside his  conviction.    He  alleges\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel.  On the  form provided to\n\nappellant, he specified that counsel (1) had failed to object\n\nto part  of the prosecutor's  closing argument;  and (2)  had\n\nfailed to  object  to  the  trial  court's  jury  instruction\n\nregarding  appellant's failure  to testify.   A  third ground\n\nsurfaced in the pleadings filed by appellant in the course of\n\nthe district court proceedings.  First,  in his memorandum in\n\nsupport of  the    2255 motion, appellant  merely stated,  in\n\ndescribing the nature of the defense presented at trial, that\n\nhe  \"was not permitted to testify on  his own behalf.\"  Next,\n\nin his  objections to  the report  and recommendation  of the\n\nmagistrate  judge, appellant developed  this point by arguing\n\nthat counsel's performance was inadequate on the ground  that\n\ncounsel  had told appellant  that it  was \"not  possible\" for\n\nappellant to  take  the  stand.    This,  appellant  averred,\n\nviolated his right to testify on his own behalf.  Finally, in\n\na request  for an evidentiary hearing,  appellant stated that\n\ntrial counsel  \"erroneously advised [appellant]  that it  was\n\nimpossible for him to testify. . . .\"\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          A full  account of the  facts is  presented in  our\n\nopinion  affirming appellant's  conviction.   We repeat  only\n\nthose  facts necessary  for  an understanding  of the  claims\n\nraised in  the   2255  motion.  In  1989, the DEA  and Puerto\n\nRico   police  officers  began  an  investigation  concerning\n\nsuspected drug  dealers.    Andaluz,  the  undercover  agent,\n\narranged to  purchase five  kilograms of cocaine  for $70,000\n\nfrom Vazquez-Carrera.   The cocaine was not  delivered at the\n\nfirst meeting  because Vazquez-Carrera did not  have the keys\n\nto the apartment where the drugs were stored.  However, Cruz-\n\nRosario met with Andaluz to discuss further arrangements.\n\n          A few  days  later, a  second meeting  was set  up.\n\nAndaluz  and an  informant drove  to the designated  place, a\n\nshopping  center, where  they  were met  by Cruz-Rosario  and\n\nVazquez-Carrera who arrived in the same automobile.  Vazquez-\n\nCarrera and the informant then left in the informant's car to\n\npick up the  cocaine.  When they returned, they  drove into a\n\nrear  parking lot of the shopping center.  They were followed\n\nby appellant  in a separate car.   When Andaluz  went over to\n\nthe informant's car to look at  the cocaine, he was joined by\n\n                             -3-\n\nappellant who had  been seated  on the sidewalk  next to  the\n\nparking lot.  Andaluz asked appellant if he was with Vazquez-\n\nCarrera and appellant  said that he was;  appellant then told\n\nAndaluz that the  cocaine was in  the back seat  of the  car.\n\nWhen  they arrived  at  the informant's  car,  they found  it\n\nunlocked  with  the  keys  in  the  ignition.   According  to\n\nAndaluz,  appellant helped him to lock up the car.  Appellant\n\nstated to Andaluz that he  had come himself because  Vazquez-\n\nCarrera did not  know how to do the deal  and that any future\n\ndeals would  be done  differently.  Appellant  also responded\n\naffirmatively  when Andaluz asked him if the cocaine was his.\n\nAs  the  money  was  about to  change  hands,  appellant  was\n\narrested.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          To  present  a   successful  claim  of  ineffective\n\nassistance of  counsel,  appellant must  establish that  \"the\n\nalleged  deficiencies  in  professional  performance  assumed\n\nunconstitutional  dimensions.  .  .  .\"   Barrett  v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 965 F.2d 1184,  1193 (1st Cir. 1992).   The benchmark\n      \n\nis  \"whether  counsel's  conduct  so  undermined  the  proper\n\nfunctioning of the adversarial  process that the trial cannot\n\nbe relied on as  having produced a just result.\"   Strickland\n                                                             \n\nv.  Washington,  466  U.S.   668,  686  (1984).    Strickland\n                                                             \n\nestablished   a  two-prong   test  for   determining  whether\n\ncounsel's conduct was  so defective as to require reversal of\n\n                             -4-\n\na  conviction.   A  defendant must  establish that  counsel's\n\nconduct  fell below an  objective standard  of reasonableness\n\nand  that  he  was prejudiced  in  the  sense  that \"but  for\n\ncounsel's  errors,   the  result   below   would  have   been\n\ndifferent.\"  See  Murchu v.  United States, 926  F.2d 50,  58\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 99 (1991).\n                                      \n\nBecause we find that appellant has not established prejudice,\n\nwe   need   not  address   the  question   whether  counsel's\n\nperformance was ineffective.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697\n                                            \n\n(court  need not  examine  adequacy of  counsel's performance\n\n\"[i]f it  is easier  to dispose  of the  . .  . claim  on the\n\nground of lack of sufficient prejudice\").\n\n          1.   The prosecutor's closing argument.   Appellant\n                                                \n\nargues that counsel  erred in not objecting  to the following\n\nstatements.\n\n               The   evidence    shows   that   the\n          informant's  vehicle  and  the  defendant\n          [Vega-Encarnacion]  parked  at  the  back\n          side  of the shopping center parking lot.\n          And  the evidence  shows that  he stayed,\n          you remember that he stayed  during [the]\n          time that  Roberto goes to the other side\n          to  talk with Officer  Andaluz.   And why\n          will he stay in that place, near the area\n          that the informant's car was and near the\n          area that [the] cocaine was.\n\n               You   remember  that   the  evidence\n          proves  that  the  informant's   car  was\n          unlocked, with a key in the  ignition and\n          with the five kilos of the cocaine in the\n          back seat.  Are you going to believe that\n          Roberto  Vazquez  Carrera  will leave  in\n          that area with five kilos of cocaine that\n          cost seventy thousand dollars, with a key\n\n                             -5-\n\n          in the  ignition and  the door open.   Of\n          course not.   Drug traffickers don't work\n          in that way.\n\n          On appeal, appellant argues that these remarks were\n\nimproper   on  the  ground  that  they  constituted  personal\n\nexpressions of opinion  that appellant's role was  as a look-\n\nout during the transaction.  As for  the reference to the way\n\ndrug  dealers  work,   appellant  maintains  that   testimony\n\nconcerning drug operations is  the subject of expert opinion.\n\nAppellant   relies   on   cases   in   which  challenges   to\n\nprosecutorial comments were attacked on direct appeal.  In so\n\ndoing, appellant misconstrues the nature of the inquiry.  The\n\ntest  is not  whether the  prosecutor's  comments constituted\n\nplain error, but whether counsel's failure to object to  them\n\nprejudiced appellant.\n\n          On  this question, we fail to  see any prejudice to\n\nappellant.    The  direct  testimony  of  Andaluz  identified\n\nappellant, based on appellant's  own statements, as a primary\n\nplayer  in the drug transaction.   Thus, we  can hardly fault\n\ncounsel  for failing  to  object to  the characterization  of\n\nappellant  as a look-out -- a less involved role.  Certainly,\n                        \n\nwe cannot say that  but for counsel's failure to  object, the\n\nresult would have been  different, i.e., that appellant would\n                                       \n\nnot have been convicted.\n\n          2.   Jury Instruction.   Appellant's second  ground\n                               \n\nfor relief is  based on  counsel's failure to  object to  the\n\n                             -6-\n\ntrial  judge's  \"ambiguous\" jury  instruction  concerning the\n\neffect  of appellant's failure  to testify.   The trial judge\n\ncharged as follows:\n\n               Now,  the  indictment  or   form  of\n          charges  against  a   defendant  is   not\n          evidence of guilt.  Indeed, the defendant\n          is  presumed by the  law to  be innocent.\n          The law  does not require a  defendant to\n          prove  his  innocence   or  produce   any\n          evidence at  all and no inference  may be\n          drawn by the  [decision of] defendant not\n          to testify.\n\nWe first  note that appellant's only reference to this ground\n\non  appeal is in a description of  the contents of the   2255\n\npetition.   Nowhere does appellant present any argument as to\n\nwhy  the failure  of counsel  to object  to this  instruction\n\nconstitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          In   any  event,   the  allegations   of  prejudice\n\npresented below -- (1) that the instruction left the jury \"in\n\nthe  dark\" as to what weight to place on appellant's decision\n\nnot to testify; and  (2) that the instruction did  nothing to\n\nprevent the  jury  from  imagining  reasons  for  appellant's\n\nfailure to testify in rebuttal to the statements of Andaluz -\n\n- are  not persuasive.   This is  highlighted by  appellant's\n\nargument  set  out  in  his  objections  to  the  report  and\n\nrecommendation  of  the  magistrate  judge  that  the  proper\n\ninstruction should have stated that\n\n          \"under  our  constitution,   he  has   no\n          obligation  to testify or  to present any\n          other   evidence   because   it  is   the\n\n                             -7-\n\n          prosecution's duty to prove the defendant\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nPerceiving   no  significant   difference  between   the  two\n\ninstructions, it also is difficult to perceive any prejudice.\n\n          3.   Right to testify.   Appellant claims  that his\n                               \n\nattorney deceived him by  leading him to believe that  it was\n\nlegally  impossible  for  appellant  to testify  on  his  own\n\nbehalf.  He asserts that this claim cannot be resolved in the\n\nabsence  of an  evidentiary hearing.   The district  court is\n\nrequired to hold such a hearing \"if the records and  files in\n\nthe case, or an  expanded record, cannot conclusively resolve\n\nsubstantial   issues   of  material   fact,  `and   when  the\n\nallegations made,  if true,  would require relief.'\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Butt,  731 F.2d  75, 78  (1st Cir.  1984) (quoting\n               \n\nUnited  States  v.  Fournier, 594  F.2d  276,  279 (1st  Cir.\n                            \n\n1979)).  We therefore  must first determine whether appellant\n\nwould be  entitled to  relief if  he proved  his allegations.\n\nOnly  if he  would, do  we then  decide whether  the district\n\ncourt  abused its  discretion in  not holding  an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n          A criminal defendant has a constitutional right  to\n\ntestify on his  own behalf.  Rock  v. Arkansas, 483  U.S. 44,\n                                              \n\n51-53 (1987).  This right is personal and cannot be waived by\n\ntrial  counsel.  Nichols v. Butler, 953 F.2d 1550, 1552 (11th\n                                  \n\nCir. 1992).\n\n                             -8-\n\n          [I]f defense counsel  never informed  the\n          defendant  of the  right to  testify, and\n          that the ultimate decision belongs to the\n          defendant,  counsel would  have neglected\n          the vital  professional responsibility of\n          ensuring  that  the defendant's  right to\n          testify  is protected and that any waiver\n          of that right is knowing and voluntary.\n\nUnited States v.  Teague, 953  F.2d 1525,  1534 (11th  Cir.),\n                        \n\ncert. denied,  113 S. Ct.  127 (1992).   Teague held  that in\n                                               \n\nsuch  circumstances,  counsel  has not  provided  \"reasonably\n\neffective assistance.\"  Id.\n                           \n\n          We  question, however, whether  the bare allegation\n\nthat counsel  would not let appellant  testify is sufficient,\n\nwithout  more, to satisfy the first prong of Strickland.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnderwood v.  Clark,  939 F.2d  473, 475-76  (7th Cir.  1991)\n                   \n\n(affidavit   of  defendant   stating   only  the   \"barebones\n\nassertion\" that \"[m]y attorney  told me I could  not testify\"\n\ninsufficient to require an evidentiary hearing; some \"greater\n\nparticularity  is  necessary\").     We  addressed  a  similar\n\nsituation  in regard  to allegations that  a guilty  plea was\n\ninduced  by  attorney  misrepresentations.   We  stated  that\n\nevidentiary  hearings have been  granted to  defendants \"only\n\nwhen  [such] allegations  were  highly specific  and  usually\n\naccompanied  by some  independent corroboration.\"   Butt, 731\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 80 n.5, quoted in  Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d 29, 30\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Even  assuming that  his counsel's  performance was\n\nconstitutionally deficient, appellant  still must satisfy the\n\n                             -9-\n\nsecond  part  of  the  Strickland  test.    In  this  regard,\n                                 \n\nappellant points out that  the government informant and Cruz-\n\nRosario   identified   Vazquez-Carrera    as   the    primary\n\ndistributor.  Further, appellant  asserts, his name was never\n\nmentioned  during  the  negotiations  for  the  sale  of  the\n\ncocaine.  The only  evidence implicating appellant, he points\n\nout, was  the testimony  of Andaluz  as to the  incriminating\n\nstatements allegedly made by appellant to Andaluz.\n\n          Appellant  argues  that  where  the  issue  is  not\n\nwhether  a  crime was  committed  but rather  is  whether the\n\ndefendant  was the  individual who  committed the  crime, his\n\ntestimony  takes on  \"`greater  importance.'\"   He relies  on\n\nNichols for this proposition.  However, in Nichols, there was\n                                                  \n\na  real question as to whether the defendant actually was the\n\nperson  who perpetrated the crime.   The only  witness to the\n\nrobbery in Nichols  had glanced at the robber for less than a\n                  \n\nsecond  and another witness  had testified  that he,  not the\n\ndefendant, had committed the crime.  953 F.2d at 1551.  There\n\nis no question here  that appellant was on  the scene and  he\n\ndoes not deny that he spoke with Andaluz.\n\n          Nonetheless, he  asserts that he was  prejudiced in\n\nthis situation  because \"there  was  only one  person in  the\n\nposition to  challenge  agent Andaluz's  testimony  --  Vega-\n\nEncarnacion himself.\"    As  such,  he urges,  the  jury  was\n\nentitled to  hear appellant's  version of  the facts so  that\n\n                             -10-\n\nthey could  weigh his credibility against  the credibility of\n\nAndaluz.    Thus,  appellant  concludes  that   prejudice  is\n\nestablished  and that  \"the government  is wrong  in claiming\n\nthat [his] testimony could not [have] changed the outcome  of\n\nthe trial.\"\n\n          Although appellant's  claim that he has  a right to\n\ntestify  which  cannot  be  waived  by  his  counsel  is  one\n\ncognizable  under     2255,  his allegations  concerning  the\n\nprejudice  resulting  from  counsel's  supposedly  inadequate\n\nrepresentation  are  nothing more  than  \"conclusions without\n\nspecific  and detailed supporting facts.\"  See Butt, 731 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 77.   In this situation,  we need not treat  them as true.\n\nSee Porcaro v. United States, 784 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir.) (per\n                            \n\ncuriam),  cert. denied,  479 U.S.  916 (1986).   In  essence,\n                      \n\nappellant's argument regarding  prejudice boils  down to  the\n\nbare assertion that had appellant been allowed to testify, he\n\nwould have  adequately rebutted and  explained the statements\n\nmade  by  Andaluz.    What  is  lacking,  obviously,  is  any\n\nindication of exactly what  appellant's testimony would  have\n\nbeen.    Indeed, there  is no  getting  around the  fact that\n\nappellant  could  have  supplied   this  information  to  the\n\ndistrict  court when  he filed  his    2255 motion.   In  the\n\nabsence  of this  kind of  specificity, it  is impossible  to\n\ndetermine that, but for  counsel's alleged errors, the result\n\nbelow would have been different.\n\n                             -11-\n\n          We do not believe  that in this situation a    2255\n\nmovant can  just  declare that  because  he was  entitled  to\n\ntestify,  a hearing  should have  been held.   \"Some  greater\n\nparticularity is necessary . . . to give the claim sufficient\n\ncredibility  to warrant  a  further  investment  of  judicial\n\nresources in determining the truth of the claim.\"  Underwood,\n                                                            \n\n939 F.2d at  476.  As appellant has  not demonstrated that he\n\nis entitled to relief by providing the requisite specificity,\n\nthe  district  court  did not  abuse  its  discretion  in not\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                             -12-\n",

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1626</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).\n\n          Appellant has filed  a petition under  28 U.S.C.   \n\n2255  seeking  to  set  aside his  conviction.    He  alleges\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel.  On the  form provided to\n\nappellant, he specified that counsel (1) had failed to object\n\nto part  of the prosecutor's  closing argument;  and (2)  had\n\nfailed to  object  to  the  trial  court's  jury  instruction\n\nregarding  appellant's failure  to testify.   A  third ground\n\nsurfaced in the pleadings filed by appellant in the course of\n\nthe district court proceedings.  First,  in his memorandum in\n\nsupport of  the    2255 motion, appellant  merely stated,  in\n\ndescribing the nature of the defense presented at trial, that\n\nhe  \"was not permitted to testify on  his own behalf.\"  Next,\n\nin his  objections to  the report  and recommendation  of the\n\nmagistrate  judge, appellant developed  this point by arguing\n\nthat counsel's performance was inadequate on the ground  that\n\ncounsel  had told appellant  that it  was \"not  possible\" for\n\nappellant to  take  the  stand.    This,  appellant  averred,\n\nviolated his right to testify on his own behalf.  Finally, in\n\na request  for an evidentiary hearing,  appellant stated that\n\ntrial counsel  \"erroneously advised [appellant]  that it  was\n\nimpossible for him to testify. . . .\"\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          A full  account of the  facts is  presented in  our\n\nopinion  affirming appellant's  conviction.   We repeat  only\n\nthose  facts necessary  for  an understanding  of the  claims\n\nraised in  the   2255  motion.  In  1989, the DEA  and Puerto\n\nRico   police  officers  began  an  investigation  concerning\n\nsuspected drug  dealers.    Andaluz,  the  undercover  agent,\n\narranged to  purchase five  kilograms of cocaine  for $70,000\n\nfrom Vazquez-Carrera.   The cocaine was not  delivered at the\n\nfirst meeting  because Vazquez-Carrera did not  have the keys\n\nto the apartment where the drugs were stored.  However, Cruz-\n\nRosario met with Andaluz to discuss further arrangements.\n\n          A few  days  later, a  second meeting  was set  up.\n\nAndaluz  and an  informant drove  to the designated  place, a\n\nshopping  center, where  they  were met  by Cruz-Rosario  and\n\nVazquez-Carrera who arrived in the same automobile.  Vazquez-\n\nCarrera and the informant then left in the informant's car to\n\npick up the  cocaine.  When they returned, they  drove into a\n\nrear  parking lot of the shopping center.  They were followed\n\nby appellant  in a separate car.   When Andaluz  went over to\n\nthe informant's car to look at  the cocaine, he was joined by\n\n                             -3-\n\nappellant who had  been seated  on the sidewalk  next to  the\n\nparking lot.  Andaluz asked appellant if he was with Vazquez-\n\nCarrera and appellant  said that he was;  appellant then told\n\nAndaluz that the  cocaine was in  the back seat  of the  car.\n\nWhen  they arrived  at  the informant's  car,  they found  it\n\nunlocked  with  the  keys  in  the  ignition.   According  to\n\nAndaluz,  appellant helped him to lock up the car.  Appellant\n\nstated to Andaluz that he  had come himself because  Vazquez-\n\nCarrera did not  know how to do the deal  and that any future\n\ndeals would  be done  differently.  Appellant  also responded\n\naffirmatively  when Andaluz asked him if the cocaine was his.\n\nAs  the  money  was  about to  change  hands,  appellant  was\n\narrested.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          To  present  a   successful  claim  of  ineffective\n\nassistance of  counsel,  appellant must  establish that  \"the\n\nalleged  deficiencies  in  professional  performance  assumed\n\nunconstitutional  dimensions.  .  .  .\"   Barrett  v.

See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697\n                                            \n\n(court  need not  examine  adequacy of  counsel's performance\n\n\"[i]f it  is easier  to dispose  of the  . .  . claim  on the\n\nground of lack of sufficient prejudice\").\n\n          1.   The prosecutor's closing argument.   Appellant\n                                                \n\nargues that counsel  erred in not objecting  to the following\n\nstatements.\n\n               The   evidence    shows   that   the\n          informant's  vehicle  and  the  defendant\n          [Vega-Encarnacion]  parked  at  the  back\n          side  of the shopping center parking lot.\n          And  the evidence  shows that  he stayed,\n          you remember that he stayed  during [the]\n          time that  Roberto goes to the other side\n          to  talk with Officer  Andaluz.   And why\n          will he stay in that place, near the area\n          that the informant's car was and near the\n          area that [the] cocaine was.\n\n               You   remember  that   the  evidence\n          proves  that  the  informant's   car  was\n          unlocked, with a key in the  ignition and\n          with the five kilos of the cocaine in the\n          back seat.  Are you going to believe that\n          Roberto  Vazquez  Carrera  will leave  in\n          that area with five kilos of cocaine that\n          cost seventy thousand dollars, with a key\n\n                             -5-\n\n          in the  ignition and  the door open.   Of\n          course not.   Drug traffickers don't work\n          in that way.\n\n          On appeal, appellant argues that these remarks were\n\nimproper   on  the  ground  that  they  constituted  personal\n\nexpressions of opinion  that appellant's role was  as a look-\n\nout during the transaction.  As for  the reference to the way\n\ndrug  dealers  work,   appellant  maintains  that   testimony\n\nconcerning drug operations is  the subject of expert opinion.\n\nAppellant   relies   on   cases   in   which  challenges   to\n\nprosecutorial comments were attacked on direct appeal.  In so\n\ndoing, appellant misconstrues the nature of the inquiry.  The\n\ntest  is not  whether the  prosecutor's  comments constituted\n\nplain error, but whether counsel's failure to object to  them\n\nprejudiced appellant.\n\n          On  this question, we fail to  see any prejudice to\n\nappellant.    The  direct  testimony  of  Andaluz  identified\n\nappellant, based on appellant's  own statements, as a primary\n\nplayer  in the drug transaction.   Thus, we  can hardly fault\n\ncounsel  for failing  to  object to  the characterization  of\n\nappellant  as a look-out -- a less involved role.  Certainly,\n                        \n\nwe cannot say that  but for counsel's failure to  object, the\n\nresult would have been  different, i.e., that appellant would\n                                       \n\nnot have been convicted.\n\n          2.   Jury Instruction.   Appellant's second  ground\n                               \n\nfor relief is  based on  counsel's failure to  object to  the\n\n                             -6-\n\ntrial  judge's  \"ambiguous\" jury  instruction  concerning the\n\neffect  of appellant's failure  to testify.   The trial judge\n\ncharged as follows:\n\n               Now,  the  indictment  or   form  of\n          charges  against  a   defendant  is   not\n          evidence of guilt.  Indeed, the defendant\n          is  presumed by the  law to  be innocent.\n          The law  does not require a  defendant to\n          prove  his  innocence   or  produce   any\n          evidence at  all and no inference  may be\n          drawn by the  [decision of] defendant not\n          to testify.\n\nWe first  note that appellant's only reference to this ground\n\non  appeal is in a description of  the contents of the   2255\n\npetition.   Nowhere does appellant present any argument as to\n\nwhy  the failure  of counsel  to object  to this  instruction\n\nconstitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          In   any  event,   the  allegations   of  prejudice\n\npresented below -- (1) that the instruction left the jury \"in\n\nthe  dark\" as to what weight to place on appellant's decision\n\nnot to testify; and  (2) that the instruction did  nothing to\n\nprevent the  jury  from  imagining  reasons  for  appellant's\n\nfailure to testify in rebuttal to the statements of Andaluz -\n\n- are  not persuasive.   This is  highlighted by  appellant's\n\nargument  set  out  in  his  objections  to  the  report  and\n\nrecommendation  of  the  magistrate  judge  that  the  proper\n\ninstruction should have stated that\n\n          \"under  our  constitution,   he  has   no\n          obligation  to testify or  to present any\n          other   evidence   because   it  is   the\n\n                             -7-\n\n          prosecution's duty to prove the defendant\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nPerceiving   no  significant   difference  between   the  two\n\ninstructions, it also is difficult to perceive any prejudice.\n\n          3.   Right to testify.   Appellant claims  that his\n                               \n\nattorney deceived him by  leading him to believe that  it was\n\nlegally  impossible  for  appellant  to testify  on  his  own\n\nbehalf.  He asserts that this claim cannot be resolved in the\n\nabsence  of an  evidentiary hearing.   The district  court is\n\nrequired to hold such a hearing \"if the records and  files in\n\nthe case, or an  expanded record, cannot conclusively resolve\n\nsubstantial   issues   of  material   fact,  `and   when  the\n\nallegations made,  if true,  would require relief.'\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

We  addressed  a  similar\n\nsituation  in regard  to allegations that  a guilty  plea was\n\ninduced  by  attorney  misrepresentations.   We  stated  that\n\nevidentiary  hearings have been  granted to  defendants \"only\n\nwhen  [such] allegations  were  highly specific  and  usually\n\naccompanied  by some  independent corroboration.\"   Butt, 731\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 80 n.5, quoted in  Siciliano v.

In  this  regard,\n                                 \n\nappellant points out that  the government informant and Cruz-\n\nRosario   identified   Vazquez-Carrera    as   the    primary\n\ndistributor.  Further, appellant  asserts, his name was never\n\nmentioned  during  the  negotiations  for  the  sale  of  the\n\ncocaine.  The only  evidence implicating appellant, he points\n\nout, was  the testimony  of Andaluz  as to the  incriminating\n\nstatements allegedly made by appellant to Andaluz.\n\n          Appellant  argues  that  where  the  issue  is  not\n\nwhether  a  crime was  committed  but rather  is  whether the\n\ndefendant  was the  individual who  committed the  crime, his\n\ntestimony  takes on  \"`greater  importance.'\"   He relies  on\n\nNichols for this proposition.  However, in Nichols, there was\n                                                  \n\na  real question as to whether the defendant actually was the\n\nperson  who perpetrated the crime.   The only  witness to the\n\nrobbery in Nichols  had glanced at the robber for less than a\n                  \n\nsecond  and another witness  had testified  that he,  not the\n\ndefendant, had committed the crime.  953 F.2d at 1551.  There\n\nis no question here  that appellant was on  the scene and  he\n\ndoes not deny that he spoke with Andaluz.\n\n          Nonetheless, he  asserts that he was  prejudiced in\n\nthis situation  because \"there  was  only one  person in  the\n\nposition to  challenge  agent Andaluz's  testimony  --  Vega-\n\nEncarnacion himself.\"    As  such,  he urges,  the  jury  was\n\nentitled to  hear appellant's  version of  the facts so  that\n\n                             -10-\n\nthey could  weigh his credibility against  the credibility of\n\nAndaluz.    Thus,  appellant  concludes  that   prejudice  is\n\nestablished  and that  \"the government  is wrong  in claiming\n\nthat [his] testimony could not [have] changed the outcome  of\n\nthe trial.\"\n\n          Although appellant's  claim that he has  a right to\n\ntestify  which  cannot  be  waived  by  his  counsel  is  one\n\ncognizable  under     2255,  his allegations  concerning  the\n\nprejudice  resulting  from  counsel's  supposedly  inadequate\n\nrepresentation  are  nothing more  than  \"conclusions without\n\nspecific  and detailed supporting facts.\"  See Butt, 731 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 77.   In this situation,  we need not treat  them as true.\n\nSee Porcaro v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465041\"><a href=\"/opinion/465041/peter-j-porcaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir.)

In  essence,\n                      \n\nappellant's argument regarding  prejudice boils  down to  the\n\nbare assertion that had appellant been allowed to testify, he\n\nwould have  adequately rebutted and  explained the statements\n\nmade  by  Andaluz.    What  is  lacking,  obviously,  is  any\n\nindication of exactly what  appellant's testimony would  have\n\nbeen.    Indeed, there  is no  getting  around the  fact that\n\nappellant  could  have  supplied   this  information  to  the\n\ndistrict  court when  he filed  his    2255 motion.   In  the\n\nabsence  of this  kind of  specificity, it  is impossible  to\n\ndetermine that, but for  counsel's alleged errors, the result\n\nbelow would have been different.\n\n                             -11-\n\n          We do not believe  that in this situation a    2255\n\nmovant can  just  declare that  because  he was  entitled  to\n\ntestify,  a hearing  should have  been held.   \"Some  greater\n\nparticularity is necessary . . . to give the claim sufficient\n\ncredibility  to warrant  a  further  investment  of  judicial\n\nresources in determining the truth of the claim.\"  Underwood,\n                                                            \n\n939 F.2d at  476.  As appellant has  not demonstrated that he\n\nis entitled to relief by providing the requisite specificity,\n\nthe  district  court  did not  abuse  its  discretion  in not\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                             -12-\n</pre>",
