Between  1979 and  1985  the  appellant,\n                \n\nGilbert  Gonsalves, worked in  the Panama Canal  Zone for the\n\nPanama Canal Commission.   He believed that  the Panama Canal\n\nTreaty gave  an exemption from United States  income taxes to\n\nAmerican employees  of the Commission.   In 1986,  the United\n\nStates Supreme Court decided that the treaty had  not created\n\nsuch  an exemption.  O'Connor  v. United States,  479 U.S. 27\n                                               \n\n(1986).\n\n     By the  time the  Supreme Court answered  the underlying\n\nquestion, however, Mr. Gonsalves and the IRS were locked in a\n\nquarrel over the extent of Mr. Gonsalves' tax liability.  The\n\nIRS  had  received  some  tax payments,  but  said  that  Mr.\n\nGonsalves still  owed money to the  government; Mr. Gonsalves\n\nsaid  that he  had  overpaid.   The  IRS  made  at least  one\n\nassessment, for tax year 1981, and in March 1988 it collected\n\nsome  of the amount assessed  by levying upon  a bank account\n\nthat belonged to Mr. Gonsalves.   See generally Gonsalves  v.\n                                                         \n\nInternal  Revenue Service,  975 F.2d  13, 14 (1st  Cir. 1992)\n                         \n\n(per curiam).\n\n     Although  the  remedies  were   available  to  him,  Mr.\n\nGonsalves neither  challenged the  IRS' calculation of  a tax\n\ndeficiency by  filing a  petition for redetermination  in the\n\nTax  Court, nor attempted to recover the taxes paid by filing\n\na refund  action in  the district  court.  See  26 U.S.C.    \n                                              \n\n6213, 7422.  He has, however, twice sought to recover damages\n\n                             -2-\n\nfor  transgressions  that  he  says IRS  officials  committed\n\nduring  the course of their dealings with him.  Mr. Gonsalves\n\nclaims that IRS officials violated  his rights in three ways:\n\n(1) by denying him an administrative appeal despite his \"many\n\nverbal and written requests;\" (2) by seizing the funds in his\n\nbank  account  without  giving  him proper  notice  of  their\n\nintention  to  levy; and  (3) by  failing  to respond  to his\n\ninquiries  and settle his  differences with  the agency  in a\n\n\"prompt and timely\" manner.  \n\n     Mr. Gonsalves  first attempted  to recover damages  in a\n\nsuit he filed in 1991 in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Maine.  The 1991 complaint named the Internal\n\nRevenue Service  as the  only defendant, and  asserted claims\n\nunder both  the United States Constitution  and the \"Taxpayer\n\nBill of Rights.\"  26 U.S.C.    7433.  The district court gave\n\njudgment to the IRS, and we affirmed.  975 F.2d at 15-17.\n\n     In January 1992 Mr. Gonsalves filed the complaint before\n\nus  now.  Although  this complaint again  names the IRS  as a\n\ndefendant,  it also names, and its true targets appear to be,\n\nthe  district  directors  of  the  IRS  offices  in  Andover,\n\nMassachusetts, Augusta, Maine, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n(who  are identified  only by title),  and Paul  Chinouard, a\n\n\"problem resolution  officer\" at the IRS  office in Portland,\n\nMaine.  \n\n                             -3-\n\n     The allegations in the 1992 complaint echo those made in\n\nthe 1991 complaint.  However, Mr. Gonsalves now contends that\n\nhe is entitled to recover directly from the IRS officials who\n\nviolated his rights, pursuant to the doctrine first described\n\nin  Bivens v. Six Unknown  Named Agents of  Federal Bureau of\n                                                             \n\nNarcotics, 403  U.S. 388 (1971).   The  district court  ruled\n         \n\nthat  the defendants  were entitled,  at the  very  least, to\n\n\"qualified  immunity,\"  and dismissed  the  complaint.   This\n\nappeal followed.  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     \"Bivens  actions  lie  only  for  violations  of  rights\n            \n\nsecured by  the Constitution.\"   Bothke v. Fluor  Engineers &amp;\n                                                             \n\nConstructors,  Inc.,  834  F.2d  804,  814  (9th  Cir.  1987)\n                   \n\n(Beezer,  J., concurring).    Mr. Gonsalves  claims that  the\n\ndefendants  violated  the Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth\n\nAmendment, which  says  that the  federal  government  cannot\n\ndeprive a person of life,  liberty, or property \"without  due\n\nprocess  of  law.\"    The  amended  complaint  did  allege  a\n\ndeprivation  of  property  -- the  seizure  of  money in  Mr.\n\nGonsalves' bank account -- but the record contains no factual\n\nbasis  from  which  one  could infer  that  this  deprivation\n\noccurred without due process of law.\n\n     When  the  government  takes  a  person's property,  due\n\nprocess  requires that it give him  notice and an opportunity\n\nto  be  heard  \"at a  meaningful  time  and  in a  meaningful\n\n                             -4-\n\nmanner.\"   Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 (1972) (quoting\n                            \n\nArmstrong  v. Manzo, 380  U.S. 545, 552  (1965)).  Generally,\n                   \n\n\"at a  meaningful time\"  means \"notice  and a  hearing before\n                                                             \n\npersons  are  separated from  their  property,\" Rodriguez  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 629 F.Supp. 333, 347 (N.D.Ill. 1986) (emphasis\n             \n\nadded), although  in some circumstances --  for example, when\n\nthe IRS perceives that  its ability to collect taxes  will be\n\njeopardized  by  delay  --  a  post-deprivation  hearing  may\n\nadequately  protect  due process  rights.    See Phillips  v.\n                                                         \n\nCommissioner,  283  U.S.  589,  595-97  (1931);  Rodriguez v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 629 F.Supp. at 348. \n             \n\n     Except where the IRS makes such a \"jeopardy\" assessment,\n\nthe Internal Revenue  Code requires that  it give a  taxpayer\n\nnotice before it takes his property, and provide the taxpayer\n\nwith  a  choice  whether to  be  heard  before  or after  the\n\ndeprivation.    The procedure  is  as follows:  once  the IRS\n\ndetermines that a taxpayer owes  money to the government,  it\n\nmust  issue a  notice of  the deficiency,  then wait  90 days\n\nbefore  attempting to  collect the  taxes due.   26  U.S.C.  \n\n6213(a).  If the taxpayer wants a pre-deprivation hearing, he\n\ncan, during those 90 days, file a petition with the Tax Court\n\nasking it to redetermine the deficiency, and the stay against\n\ncollection efforts  will remain in effect  while the petition\n\nis pending.   Id.   Or  the taxpayer can  forego a  Tax Court\n                 \n\n                             -5-\n\nhearing, pay the tax, and seek a refund in a post-deprivation\n\naction in the district court.  26 U.S.C.   7422.\n\n     The taxpayer  may receive, and  may even be  entitled by\n\nstatute or  regulation to receive, extra process,  such as an\n\nadministrative appeal, a notice of levy, and prompt responses\n\nto his inquiries.   But, because his \"due process  rights are\n\nadequately protected by the statutory scheme which allows him\n\nto contest his tax liability in the Tax Court prior to paying\n\nthe disputed tax or to  sue for a refund in federal  district\n\ncourt . . . ,\"   Stonecipher v. Bray, 653 F.2d 398,  403 (9th\n                                    \n\nCir.  1981) (citing  Phillips  v. Commissioner,  283 U.S.  at\n                                              \n\n595),  these additional  procedures are  not constitutionally\n                                                             \n\nrequired.      For  example, once  the  taxpayer  has  either\n\nresorted to or waived a Tax Court hearing, the IRS can, as it\n\ndid here, make  a formal  assessment and then  levy upon  the\n\ntaxpayer's property to satisfy the deficiency.  See 26 U.S.C.\n                                                   \n\n   6203, 6331.   However, before it can perform the  levy, 26\n\nU.S.C.    6331(d)  requires the  IRS to  issue notice  of its\n\nintention  to levy, and to deliver the notice to the taxpayer\n\npersonally, or to mail it to his last known address.\n\n     In this case,  the district court that  tried the claims\n\nin  the  1991 complaint  found that  the  IRS had  mailed the\n\nnotice to  the wrong address.   975 F.2d at 15.   The ensuing\n\nlevy  therefore may  have  violated the  statute.   But,  the\n\nmistake did not  deprive Mr. Gonsalves  of an opportunity  to\n\n                             -6-\n\nfile  a  petition in  the Tax  Court  (an opportunity  he had\n\nalready waived  by the time of  the levy), or  to institute a\n\nrefund  action in  the  district court  (an opportunity  that\n\nremained  available to him after the levy).  It therefore did\n\nnot deny him due process of law.  See Baddour, Inc. v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  802 F.2d 801, 807 (5th Cir. 1986); Zernial v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  714  F.2d 431,  435  (5th Cir.  1983);  Rodriguez v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited  States, 629 F.Supp. at 347 (wrongful levy does not in\n              \n\nitself deny due process).\n\n     For  the   same  reason,  there   is  no  constitutional\n\nsubstance to  Mr. Gonsalves'  claims that the  defendants (1)\n\nrefused to provide him with an administrative appeal, and (2)\n\nignored his inquiries and otherwise delayed the resolution of\n\nhis  differences with the agency.  Mr. Gonsalves may have had\n\na \"right,\" created by the IRS' Statement of Procedural Rules,\n\nto an  informal  administrative  appeal.   See  26  C.F.R.   \n                                              \n\n601.106.     But   because   the  statutory   mechanisms  for\n\nchallenging agency actions in the courts offer due process to\n\ntaxpayers who face deprivations  of property by the  IRS, the\n\nappeals  procedure is  not constitutionally  necessary.   See\n                                                             \n\nRosenberg v.

See\n                                                             \n\nalso  United States  v. Horne,  714 F.2d  206, 207  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1983).  The  violation of a regulation which the Constitution\n\n                             -7-\n\ndoes  not  require  an  agency  to   adopt  does  \"not  raise\n\nconstitutional questions.\"    United States  v.

But\n\nagain,  notwithstanding  the defendants'  alleged inattention\n\nand   uncooperativeness,  constitutionally-adequate   process\n\nremained  available, in the form of a Tax Court petition or a\n\nrefund action,  to ensure  that the government  kept no  more\n\nthan  its  legal  share  of   Mr.  Gonsalves'  income.    The\n\nunderlying property interest did not go unprotected.  \n\n     The  defendants' alleged  misbehavior, it  is true,  may\n\nhave  deprived  Mr.  Gonsalves  of  the  IRS'  assistance  in\n                                                         \n\nvindicating  that  interest.    However,  such assistance  is\n\nitself neither  a \"liberty\"  nor a \"property\"  interest whose\n\ndeprivation is  capable of  redress through a  Bivens action.\n                                                     \n\nSee Francis-Sobel v.

The\n\nIRS  had  received  some  tax payments,  but  said  that  Mr.\n\nGonsalves still  owed money to the  government; Mr. Gonsalves\n\nsaid  that he  had  overpaid.

See  26 U.S.C.    \n                                              \n\n6213, 7422.  He has, however, twice sought to recover damages\n\n                             -2-\n\nfor  transgressions  that  he  says IRS  officials  committed\n\nduring  the course of their dealings with him.  Mr. Gonsalves\n\nclaims that IRS officials violated  his rights in three ways:\n\n(1) by denying him an administrative appeal despite his \"many\n\nverbal and written requests;\" (2) by seizing the funds in his\n\nbank  account  without  giving  him proper  notice  of  their\n\nintention  to  levy; and  (3) by  failing  to respond  to his\n\ninquiries  and settle his  differences with  the agency  in a\n\n\"prompt and timely\" manner.  \n\n     Mr. Gonsalves  first attempted  to recover damages  in a\n\nsuit he filed in 1991 in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Maine.  The 1991 complaint named the Internal\n\nRevenue Service  as the  only defendant, and  asserted claims\n\nunder both  the United States Constitution  and the \"Taxpayer\n\nBill of Rights.\"  26 U.S.C.    7433.  The district court gave\n\njudgment to the IRS, and we affirmed.  975 F.2d at 15-17.\n\n     In January 1992 Mr. Gonsalves filed the complaint before\n\nus  now.  Although  this complaint again  names the IRS  as a\n\ndefendant,  it also names, and its true targets appear to be,\n\nthe  district  directors  of  the  IRS  offices  in  Andover,\n\nMassachusetts, Augusta, Maine, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n(who  are identified  only by title),  and Paul  Chinouard, a\n\n\"problem resolution  officer\" at the IRS  office in Portland,\n\nMaine.  \n\n                             -3-\n\n     The allegations in the 1992 complaint echo those made in\n\nthe 1991 complaint.  However, Mr. Gonsalves now contends that\n\nhe is entitled to recover directly from the IRS officials who\n\nviolated his rights, pursuant to the doctrine first described\n\nin  Bivens v.

However, before it can perform the  levy, 26\n\nU.S.C.    6331(d)  requires the  IRS to  issue notice  of its\n\nintention  to levy, and to deliver the notice to the taxpayer\n\npersonally, or to mail it to his last known address.\n\n     In this case,  the district court that  tried the claims\n\nin  the  1991 complaint  found that  the  IRS had  mailed the\n\nnotice to  the wrong address.   975 F.2d at 15.   The ensuing\n\nlevy  therefore may  have  violated the  statute.   But,  the\n\nmistake did not  deprive Mr. Gonsalves  of an opportunity  to\n\n                             -6-\n\nfile  a  petition in  the Tax  Court  (an opportunity  he had\n\nalready waived  by the time of  the levy), or  to institute a\n\nrefund  action in  the  district court  (an opportunity  that\n\nremained  available to him after the levy).  It therefore did\n\nnot deny him due process of law.  See Baddour, Inc. v.
