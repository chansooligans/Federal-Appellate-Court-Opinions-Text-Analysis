The  plaintiff, Brendan  McGuinness,  an\n                \n\ninmate at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar\n\nJunction, filed  a complaint, pursuant  to 42 U.S.C.    1983,\n\nagainst eight prison administrators and officers.  McGuinness\n\nhas appealed a district court order granting summary judgment\n\nin  favor of  the defendants  and denying  his request  for a\n\npreliminary injunction.  We affirm.1\n\n                              I.\n\n     We  review  the  grant  of  summary  judgment  de  novo,\n\nemploying the same standards  as is required of  the district\n\ncourt,  Webb v. Internal Revenue Serv., 15 F.3d 203, 205 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1994), and mindful of our  duty to review the record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Shinberg  v.\n                                                         \n\nBruk, 875 F.2d 973, 974 (1st Cir. 1989).\n    \n\n          A  motion for  summary  judgment must  be\n          granted if  \"there is no genuine issue as\n          to  any material fact  and ... the moving\n          party  is entitled  to  a  judgment as  a\n          matter of  law.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(c).\n          To  succeed, the  moving party  must show\n          that there is  an absence of  evidence to\n          support  the nonmoving  party's position.\n          Having done  so, the burden shifts to the\n          nonmoving   party    to   establish   the\n          existence of an issue  of fact that could\n          affect  the outcome of the litigation and\n          from which  a reasonable jury  could find\n          for the opponent.  It is settled that the\n          nonmovant   may   not   rest  upon   mere\n          allegations,  but  must adduce  specific,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Our   affirmance  of  the   grant  of   summary  judgment\nnecessarily is an affirmance of the denial of the preliminary\ninjunction request.  We, therefore, do not address separately\nthe preliminary injunction issue.\n\n                             -2-\n\n          provable  facts demonstrating  that there\n          is  a  triable  issue.

If the  evidence\n          is   merely   colorable    or   is    not\n          significantly probative, summary judgment\n          may be granted.\n\nRogers v. Fair, 902  F.2d 140, 143 (1st Cir.  1990) (internal\n              \n\nquotations and citations omitted).\n\n                             II.\n\n     In February 1992, McGuinness  admitted to attempting  to\n\nflush his sweatshirt  down the toilet  in his cell.   He  was\n\nfound guilty of three  disciplinary offenses2 with respect to\n\nthis  incident.   McGuinness'  institutional folder  was then\n\nreviewed.  He had  had 44 disciplinary reports in  two years,\n\nincluding  six   assaults  on  staff,   four  violations  for\n\npossession of a  weapon, and two  drug-related offenses.   At\n\nthe  time of  the flushing  incident,  McGuinness was  in the\n\nprison's Departmental Segregation Unit (DSU) for assaulting a\n\nstaff  member.   After  reciting  this,  the hearing  officer\n\nstated:\n\n          [t]his  inmate exhibits  assaultive along\n          with disruptive behavior both  in general\n          population and segregation.   The conduct\n          that the inmate has displayed makes him a\n          viable candidate for  DDU.  This  type of\n\n                    \n\n2.  103 CMR  430.24(3): Failure to keep one's person or one's\nquarters  in  accordance  with institutional  rules;  103 CMR\n430.24(8): Conduct  which  disrupts or  interferes  with  the\nsecurity  or  orderly running  of  the  institution; 103  CMR\n430.24(22):  Willfully destroying or  damaging state property\nor the property of another person.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          defiant   behavior,   along  with   total\n          disregard for the  rules and  regulations\n          of  the  institution is  unacceptable and\n          will not be tolerated.\n\nSupplementary Record Appendix, No. 94-1142, (\"SRA\") at p. 20.\n\nMcGuinness was given a sanction of six months in the prison's\n\nDepartmental Disciplinary  Unit  (DDU).3   According  to  the\n\naffidavit of  defendant Larry E. DuBois,  the Commissioner of\n\nthe  Massachusetts Department  of Corrections (DOC),  the DDU\n\nhas a maximum  capacity of  121 inmates and  is reserved  for\n\nviolent   inmates  and/or  those   with  severe  disciplinary\n\nproblems.  SRA at pp. 116-19.\n\n                              A.\n\n     McGuinness filed a    1983 action against several prison\n\nofficials  claiming  that  conditions  in  the  DDU  violated\n\nprovisions which  grew out of state  court litigation, Hoffer\n                                                             \n\nv. Fair, Supreme  Judicial Court,  No. 85-71.   Hoffer was  a\n                                                      \n\nclass  action  challenging  regulations  pertaining  to,  and\n\nconditions  in, the prison's DSU.   As we  understand it, the\n\nDSU is for administrative segregation and an inmate typically\n\nis housed in the DSU because  he is believed to pose a threat\n\n                    \n\n3.  According to  the defendants, McGuinness  served his  six\nmonth DDU  sentence  for the  flushing incident  from May  to\nNovember 1992.  He was released from the unit, but upon being\nfound  guilty of an assault,  he received a  second six month\nterm in the DDU and began serving this term in February 1993.\nPresently, according to the defendants, McGuinness is serving\nyet  a third  six month  period in  the DDU,  as a  result of\nanother  assault.  SRA  at p. 128;  Defendants' brief, Appeal\nNo. 94-1142, at p.2 n.1.\n\n                             -4-\n\nto security.4   When that  threat has  dissipated, an  inmate\n\nought to be released back into the general prison population.\n\nThe  result  of the  Hoffer  litigation  was promulgation  of\n                           \n\nrevised regulations, including those pertaining to the review\n\nand  release of an inmate  after DSU placement.   The revised\n\nregulations  provide  for  periodic  hearings  to  review  an\n\ninmate's DSU classification and written guidance to an inmate\n\nregarding what  he might do to shorten his DSU term.  See 103\n                                                         \n\nCMR 421.15(2)(c); 103  CMR 421.19(2)(a) (effective 12/15/89).\n\nThe revised regulations also provide for an expanded range of\n\nactivities  and privileges  than previously permitted  to DSU\n\ninmates,  such as  access to  educational  and rehabilitative\n\nprograms.  103 CMR 421.21 (effective 12/15/89).\n\n     While  the Hoffer  litigation was  pending in  the state\n                      \n\ncourt,  Commissioner DuBois instituted the DDU  as a new unit\n\n                    \n\n4.             An  inmate may be placed or retained\n          in  a DSU  only  after a  finding by  the\n          Commissioner    based   on    substantial\n          evidence that, if confined in the general\n          population  of   any  state  correctional\n          facility:\n\n          (1)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat to the safety of others; or\n\n          (2)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat   of    damaging   or   destroying\n          property; or\n\n          (3)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat   to  the  operation  of  a  state\n          correctional facility.\n\n103 CMR 421.09 (effective 12/15/89).\n\n                             -5-\n\nfor disciplinary segregation.5   A  sentence to  a period  of\n\nconfinement in  the DDU  is not subject  to periodic  review.\n\nInmates in  the DDU  are not  provided access  to educational\n\nprograms.  McGuinness'    1983 suit charges that the  new DDU\n\nunit  is merely  the  pre-Hoffer DSU  by  another name.    He\n                                \n\nclaimed that the improvements  in the conditions and programs\n\nin the DSU  brought about through  the Hoffer litigation,  in\n                                             \n\nparticular,  periodic  classification  review  and  access to\n\nrehabilitative programs,  are applicable to the  DDU and that\n\nthe defendants have failed to provide him with those.\n\n     Like the  district  court,  however,  we  conclude  that\n\nsummary judgment in  favor of the defendants  is warranted on\n\nthis claim.  The record is clear that the DSU,  which was the\n\nsubject of  the Hoffer litigation,  and the DDU  are separate\n                      \n\nunits, used  for distinct purposes.   Apart from Commissioner\n\nDuBois'  affidavit, the  defendants  submitted a  copy of  an\n\nApril 1992 court order in the Hoffer litigation, in which the\n                                    \n\nstate  court  declined   to  enjoin  the   Commissioner  from\n\noperating  the  DDU.   It  is  true  that the  denial  of the\n\ninjunction  was  without prejudice,  in  the  event that  the\n\nHoffer plaintiffs  could further develop their  factual claim\n      \n\nregarding  the relationship between the DDU and the DSU.  SRA\n\n                    \n\n5.  According  to  DuBois'  affidavit, he  directed  that the\nDepartment's regulations be amended  on an emergency basis so\nas to deal with what he viewed to be an  emergency situation.\nThe   amended  regulations   with  respect   to  disciplinary\nsegregation went into effect on January 22, 1992.\n\n                             -6-\n\nat pp.  122-23.   McGuinness has presented  nothing, however,\n\nindicating that the Hoffer plaintiffs subsequently  have been\n                          \n\nsuccessful in this claim.\n\n     Moreover,   McGuinness  has  not  suggested  why  it  is\n\nunlawful,  per  se,  to  treat an  inmate  in  administrative\n\nsegregation  differently  from   an  inmate  in  disciplinary\n\nsegregation.  We need  not, and therefore do not  purport to,\n\ndetermine whether the conditions in  the DDU comply with  the\n\nFederal Constitution,  but we note that  the reasons provided\n\nby  the   defendants  for  the   distinct  treatment   appear\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.  See\n                                                             \n\nTurner  v. Safley,  482 U.S.  78, 89  (1987) (announcing  the\n                 \n\nstandard for  determining the validity of  prison regulations\n\nwhich impinge on inmates' constitutional rights).  A DDU term\n\npunishes \"the most dangerous and repetitive kind of conduct,\"\n\nwhile the \"DSU remains  a place to house and  control inmates\n\nwho pose a  danger to  themselves or  to others  but for  one\n\nreason or another may  not be amenable to punishment  and for\n\nwhom the DDU  would serve  no penological  purpose.\"   DuBois\n\naffidavit at p. 4.\n\n     Because,   presumably,   an  inmate   in  administrative\n\nsegregation may  be entitled  to  release from  that type  of\n\nsegregation when  the  reasons for  its  implementation,  for\n\nexample,  a  threat  to  security, have  dissipated  and  his\n\nbehavior  in  the DSU  warrants  his release  to  the general\n\n                             -7-\n\npopulation, it is  reasonable to  require that  a DSU  inmate\n\nhave the possibility  of obtaining, and the means  to obtain,\n\nthat release  through periodic classification  review hearing\n\nand access to  rehabilitative programs.   By contrast, a  DDU\n\ninmate is being sanctioned for violent or severe disciplinary\n\nproblems  by a  fixed  period  of  a  more  severe  level  of\n\nincarceration.   As there is  no entitlement to early release\n\nfrom the DDU,  there would  appear no need  for the  periodic\n\nclassification  review hearing  nor have  we been  pointed to\n\nauthority for  the proposition that prison  officials may not\n\nsanction an inmate by withdrawing educational programs during\n\nhis placement in higher security.\n\n     We  further remark  that  the Hoffer  court, itself,  in\n                                         \n\naddressing  the  conditions  in  administrative  segregation,\n\nnoted \"the  necessity of  distinctions from the  treatment of\n\nthose confined for disciplinary violations and those confined\n\nsolely for administrative reasons.\"   Hoffer v. Fair, Supreme\n                                                    \n\nJudicial Court, No. 85-71, Memorandum, Order and Judgment #17\n\n(Sept.  19, 1989),  SRA at  p. 76.   Suffice  it to  say that\n\nsummary  judgment   for  the  defendants  was   warranted  on\n\nMcGuinness'  claim that  conditions in  the DDU  violated the\n\nstate court's rulings in the Hoffer litigation.\n                                   \n\n                              B.\n\n     McGuinness' second contention is  that his access to the\n\nlaw  library or  its materials,  while confined  to  the DDU,\n\n                             -8-\n\nfails  to comply  with a  \"stipulation of  dismissal\" entered\n\ninto  in the  Massachusetts  federal district  court case  of\n\nCepulonis v. Fair,  No. 78-3233-Z.  The  parties in Cepulonis\n                                                             \n\nstipulated  that  the  DOC  would maintain  a  satellite  law\n\nlibrary  in the  DSU  with a  designated  list of  particular\n\nlawbooks.   The  stipulation  also  contained provisions  for\n\nrequesting  access to  the satellite  library, access  to the\n\nmain prison library or to material available there but not in\n\nthe  satellite  library,  and  provisions  regarding  library\n\nhours.   The short answer  is that the  Cepulonis suit was  a\n                                                 \n\nclass action concerning law  library access of inmates housed\n\nin the DSU.  It did not speak to the DDU which, we recognize,\n          \n\nhad not yet been created.  But, by the same token, an alleged\n\nfailure to  comply with  the stipulation in  Cepulonis (which\n                                                      \n\naddresses the DSU) may  be a questionable thread on  which to\n\nhang a claim regarding the contours of the entitlement of the\n\nlaw library access in the DDU.\n\n     The  record  indicates  that an  inmate  in  the  DDU is\n\npermitted a minimum of  two hours access per  week to a  book\n\ncart with a  selection of starter volumes6; may  request from\n\n                    \n\n6.  According to the affidavit  of defendant Ronald T. Duval,\nthe Superintendent  of MCI Cedar Junction,  these include the\nFederal  Rules of  Criminal Procedure,  the Federal  Rules of\nCivil Procedure, the Local  Rules of the U.S. District  Court\nfor  the District  of  Massachusetts,  the  Federal  Practice\nDigest on Prisons, Constitutional  Law, and Criminal Law, the\nMassachusetts  Rules  of  Court, the  Massachusetts  Practice\nvolumes on Criminal Practice  and Procedure and Criminal Law,\nMassachusetts Criminal Law and  Procedure, Cohen, How to Find\n                                                             \n\n                             -9-\n\nthe prison's law  librarian any  legal materials,  up to  six\n\nitems at one  time, including legal research material  in the\n\nprison's  main law library which is not available in the DDU,\n\nwhich the inmate identifies, either by name or general topic;\n\nand may  retain loaned  legal material  in his  cell provided\n\nthat  it does not exceed  the one cubic  foot maximum level.7\n\nWe do not purport to resolve here (because it is not squarely\n\npresented) whether these  provisions for  law library  access\n\nwhile in the DDU suffice to meet any constitutional threshold\n\nfor  access  to  the courts.8    We  conclude  only that  the\n\ndefendants were entitled  to summary judgment  on McGuinness'\n\nclaim that  the provisions for  law library access,  while in\n\nthe  DDU,  violate  the   stipulation  entered  into  in  the\n\nCepulonis case regarding the DSU.\n         \n\n                    \n\nthe Law, Gobert and Cohen,  Rights of Prisoners, and  Black's\n                                               \nLaw Dictionary.  SRA at p. 127.\n\n7.  According to Duval's affidavit, DDU inmates also have the\nopportunity  to  retain and  consult  with  outside, licensed\ncounsel, both in person and by telephone.\n\n8.  To succeed on a claim of denial of a constitutional right\nof access  to courts, a  prisoner may be required  to show an\n\"actual injury\" to his ability to participate meaningfully in\nthe legal  process, unless the deprivation  is so significant\nas to constitute an injury in and of itself.

A challenge\nto the basic  adequacy of  available materials  may typify  a\nclassic  allegation  of  inherent prejudice,  but  not  every\nrestriction   on  access  to  a  prison  law  library  is  an\ninherently injurious act.  Id. at 34.\n                              \n\n                             -10-\n\n                              C.\n\n     McGuinness'  third claim was  that 103 CMR 430.25(3)(d)9\n\nwhich authorizes,  as a disciplinary sanction,  a sentence to\n\nthe  DDU  for  a period  of  up  to  ten years  impermissibly\n\nconflicts with  Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 127,    40.   That statute\n\nreads:\n\n               For  the enforcement  of discipline,\n          an inmate in any correctional institution\n          of   the   commonwealth   may,   at   the\n          discretion  of   its  superintendent,  be\n          confined,  for  a  period not  to  exceed\n          fifteen days  for any one offence,  to an\n          isolation unit.\n               Such  isolation  units must  provide\n          light, ventilation  and adequate sanitary\n          facilities,  may  contain  a  minimum  of\n          furniture, and shall provide at least one\n          full meal daily.\n\n                    \n\n9.  The   applicable   regulations   regarding   disciplinary\nproceedings authorize  the  following sanctions  for  \"major\"\nmatters:\n          (a)  Isolation, for a specified period of\n          time  not  to  exceed  15  days  for  one\n          offense, and no more than 30 days for all\n          violations arising out of one incident.\n\n          (b)  Recommended good time forfeiture.\n\n          (c)  All minor sanctions.\n\n          (d)  Sentence     to     a     Department\n          Disciplinary  Unit  for   a  period   not\n          exceeding 10 years.   An inmate  shall be\n          credited  for time  served  on a  monthly\n          basis  except  when  an  inmate  fails to\n          attend  his  monthly review  or  is found\n          guilty of a disciplinary offense.\n\n103 CMR 430.25(3) (4/10/92).\n\n                             -11-\n\nMcGuinness' contention is  that a  sentence to the  DDU is  a\n\nsentence to an isolation unit.\n\n     The statute does not define an isolation unit beyond one\n\nwhich  must provide \"light, ventilation and adequate sanitary\n\nfacilities,  may contain  a minimum  of furniture,  and shall\n\nprovide at least  one full meal  daily.\"   Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\n\n127,   40.   The prison regulations do  not further define an\n\nisolation unit.\n\n     The record,  however, evidences that the two are not the\n\nsame.  The  disciplinary proceeding regulations,  themselves,\n\ntreat  the two  as distinct.    The authorized  sanctions for\n\ncommission of a disciplinary  offense designated as a \"major\"\n\nmatter include isolation and/or  a sentence to the DDU.   See\n                                                             \n\n                             -12-\n\nsupra note 9.10   According to defendant Michael  T. Maloney,\n     \n\nDeputy Commissioner of the Massachusetts DOC:\n\n               The conditions in the DDU are not as\n          severe  as  those  that  prevail   in  an\n          \"isolation  unit\"  in  the  Massachusetts\n          Department of Correction.\n               An  inmate  in  isolation  is  never\n          allowed  a  television  or  radio.    For\n          fifteen days at a time, he is deprived of\n          all out-of-cell activity and  deprived of\n          all  outside contact or stimulus with the\n          exception of a Bible or other holy book.\n               By   contrast,   DDU   inmates   can\n          communicate with other  inmates one  hour\n          per day, five hours per week during their\n          exercise periods.  Pending good behavior,\n          they can have telephone calls, visits and\n          a television and radio.\n\nSRA at pp. 124-25; see also SRA at p. 37.\n                           \n\n     McGuinness counters by arguing  that, at the very least,\n\nthe conditions imposed for  the first 30 days  of a DDU  term\n\nviolate Mass. Gen. L. ch. 127,   40, which limits confinement\n\n                    \n\n10.  Those regulations further provide:\n\n               The  Superintendent shall  designate\n          such  person  or  persons  as   he  deems\n          appropriate  to  review  the   status  of\n          inmates housed  in isolation on  a weekly\n          basis.   No  inmate shall be  retained in\n          isolation continuously for  more than  15\n          days for any one violation.  No more than\n          30 days isolation shall be imposed  on an\n          inmate  for all violations arising out of\n          the   same  or   substantially  connected\n          incident(s),      unless     specifically\n          authorized  by  the  Commissioner.     No\n          inmate  shall,  at  any  given  time,  be\n          facing more  than 30 days of closed solid\n          door isolation  time, unless specifically\n          authorized by the Commissioner.\n\n103 CMR 430.22(2) (4/10/92).\n\n                             -13-\n\nto  an  isolation   unit  to  \"fifteen   days  for  any   one\n\noffence.\"11   According  to the  DDU Orientation  Manual, SRA\n\nat pp. 28-40, for  the first 30 days in the DDU, an inmate is\n\nnot allowed  a radio,  visitors,  or access  to a  telephone.\n\nThese privileges may be earned  after an inmate has completed\n\n30 days free of disciplinary sanctions.  SRA at p. 33.  After\n\n60 consecutive days of \"disciplinary report free behavior,\" a\n\nDDU inmate is permitted  a television and additional visiting\n\nand  telephone  periods.   SRA at.  33-34.   If,  however, an\n\ninmate   engages   in  conduct   resulting   in  disciplinary\n\n                    \n\n11.  Caselaw tells us that\n          [b]y  order of the [DOC] Commissioner, no\n          more than thirty days of isolation may be\n          imposed as a result of a single  incident\n          regardless of how many  separate offenses\n          were  involved.   [We note,  for example,\n          that,  with  respect  to  the  \"flushing\"\n          incident, McGuinness was found  guilty of\n          three  separate  prison  offenses.    See\n                                                   \n          supra  note 2.]    Also by  order of  the\n          Commissioner, at no time shall any inmate\n          be facing accumulated isolation sanctions\n          of  more  than  thirty  days   even  when\n          numerous infractions have been committed.\n          If  two  fifteen-day isolation  sanctions\n          are  to be served,  the inmate is removed\n          from  isolation   for  twenty-four  hours\n          between  the two  periods.   During  this\n          twenty-four-hour break the solid  door is\n          left  open and the inmate is accorded the\n          privileges enjoyed by inmates not serving\n          isolation  time,   including  visits  and\n          exercise.\n\nLibby  v.

SRA at p. 33.\n\n     Although these conditions may  be \"isolating,\" we do not\n\nthink the record  supports the conclusion  that the first  30\n\ndays  of a DDU confinement is a confinement to an \"isolation\"\n\nunit in violation  of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  127,   40.   A  DDU\n\ninmate,   even  during  the  initial   30  days  of  his  DDU\n\nconfinement, has a one hour per day, five days per week, out-\n\nof-cell exercise period during  which he can communicate with\n\nother inmates.  SRA at p. 37; pp. 124-25.   In contrast to an\n\ninmate in  an  isolation unit,  who  is deprived  of  reading\n\nmaterial except for a Bible or other holy book,  a DDU inmate\n\nis  permitted  four  personal  or  library  paperback  books,\n\nnewspapers or magazines in any combination.  Two books may be\n\nborrowed from  the library cart at  any one time.   SRA at p.\n\n37.   A DDU  inmate is permitted  access to the  \"DDU [Legal]\n\nResearch  Area,\" whereas  an  inmate in  isolation \"will  not\n\nnormally  be allowed Research Area access.\"  SRA at p. 38-40.\n\nThe district court did  not err in granting  summary judgment\n\nto the defendants on McGuinness' claim that a sentence to the\n\nDDU is a sentence to an isolation unit.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The  order  of  the  district  court   granting  summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants is affirmed.\n                                                \n\n                             -15-\n",

He  was\n\nfound guilty of three  disciplinary offenses2 with respect to\n\nthis  incident.   McGuinness'  institutional folder  was then\n\nreviewed.  He had  had 44 disciplinary reports in  two years,\n\nincluding  six   assaults  on  staff,   four  violations  for\n\npossession of a  weapon, and two  drug-related offenses.   At\n\nthe  time of  the flushing  incident,  McGuinness was  in the\n\nprison's Departmental Segregation Unit (DSU) for assaulting a\n\nstaff  member.

As we  understand it, the\n\nDSU is for administrative segregation and an inmate typically\n\nis housed in the DSU because  he is believed to pose a threat\n\n                    \n\n3.  According to  the defendants, McGuinness  served his  six\nmonth DDU  sentence  for the  flushing incident  from May  to\nNovember 1992.  He was released from the unit, but upon being\nfound  guilty of an assault,  he received a  second six month\nterm in the DDU and began serving this term in February 1993.\nPresently, according to the defendants, McGuinness is serving\nyet  a third  six month  period in  the DDU,  as a  result of\nanother  assault.

An  inmate may be placed or retained\n          in  a DSU  only  after a  finding by  the\n          Commissioner    based   on    substantial\n          evidence that, if confined in the general\n          population  of   any  state  correctional\n          facility:\n\n          (1)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat to the safety of others; or\n\n          (2)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat   of    damaging   or   destroying\n          property; or\n\n          (3)  The   inmate  poses   a  substantial\n          threat   to  the  operation  of  a  state\n          correctional facility.\n\n103 CMR 421.09 (effective 12/15/89).\n\n                             -5-\n\nfor disciplinary segregation.5   A  sentence to  a period  of\n\nconfinement in  the DDU  is not subject  to periodic  review.\n\nInmates in  the DDU  are not  provided access  to educational\n\nprograms.  McGuinness'    1983 suit charges that the  new DDU\n\nunit  is merely  the  pre-Hoffer DSU  by  another name.    He\n                                \n\nclaimed that the improvements  in the conditions and programs\n\nin the DSU  brought about through  the Hoffer litigation,  in\n                                             \n\nparticular,  periodic  classification  review  and  access to\n\nrehabilitative programs,  are applicable to the  DDU and that\n\nthe defendants have failed to provide him with those.\n\n     Like the  district  court,  however,  we  conclude  that\n\nsummary judgment in  favor of the defendants  is warranted on\n\nthis claim.  The record is clear that the DSU,  which was the\n\nsubject of  the Hoffer litigation,  and the DDU  are separate\n                      \n\nunits, used  for distinct purposes.   Apart from Commissioner\n\nDuBois'  affidavit, the  defendants  submitted a  copy of  an\n\nApril 1992 court order in the Hoffer litigation, in which the\n                                    \n\nstate  court  declined   to  enjoin  the   Commissioner  from\n\noperating  the  DDU.   It  is  true  that the  denial  of the\n\ninjunction  was  without prejudice,  in  the  event that  the\n\nHoffer plaintiffs  could further develop their  factual claim\n      \n\nregarding  the relationship between the DDU and the DSU.  SRA\n\n                    \n\n5.  According  to  DuBois'  affidavit, he  directed  that the\nDepartment's regulations be amended  on an emergency basis so\nas to deal with what he viewed to be an  emergency situation.\nThe   amended  regulations   with  respect   to  disciplinary\nsegregation went into effect on January 22, 1992.\n\n                             -6-\n\nat pp.  122-23.   McGuinness has presented  nothing, however,\n\nindicating that the Hoffer plaintiffs subsequently  have been\n                          \n\nsuccessful in this claim.\n\n     Moreover,   McGuinness  has  not  suggested  why  it  is\n\nunlawful,  per  se,  to  treat an  inmate  in  administrative\n\nsegregation  differently  from   an  inmate  in  disciplinary\n\nsegregation.  We need  not, and therefore do not  purport to,\n\ndetermine whether the conditions in  the DDU comply with  the\n\nFederal Constitution,  but we note that  the reasons provided\n\nby  the   defendants  for  the   distinct  treatment   appear\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.

By contrast, a  DDU\n\ninmate is being sanctioned for violent or severe disciplinary\n\nproblems  by a  fixed  period  of  a  more  severe  level  of\n\nincarceration.   As there is  no entitlement to early release\n\nfrom the DDU,  there would  appear no need  for the  periodic\n\nclassification  review hearing  nor have  we been  pointed to\n\nauthority for  the proposition that prison  officials may not\n\nsanction an inmate by withdrawing educational programs during\n\nhis placement in higher security.\n\n     We  further remark  that  the Hoffer  court, itself,  in\n                                         \n\naddressing  the  conditions  in  administrative  segregation,\n\nnoted \"the  necessity of  distinctions from the  treatment of\n\nthose confined for disciplinary violations and those confined\n\nsolely for administrative reasons.\"   Hoffer v.

Suffice  it to  say that\n\nsummary  judgment   for  the  defendants  was   warranted  on\n\nMcGuinness'  claim that  conditions in  the DDU  violated the\n\nstate court's rulings in the Hoffer litigation.\n                                   \n\n                              B.\n\n     McGuinness' second contention is  that his access to the\n\nlaw  library or  its materials,  while confined  to  the DDU,\n\n                             -8-\n\nfails  to comply  with a  \"stipulation of  dismissal\" entered\n\ninto  in the  Massachusetts  federal district  court case  of\n\nCepulonis v. Fair,  No. 78-3233-Z.  The  parties in Cepulonis\n                                                             \n\nstipulated  that  the  DOC  would maintain  a  satellite  law\n\nlibrary  in the  DSU  with a  designated  list of  particular\n\nlawbooks.   The  stipulation  also  contained provisions  for\n\nrequesting  access to  the satellite  library, access  to the\n\nmain prison library or to material available there but not in\n\nthe  satellite  library,  and  provisions  regarding  library\n\nhours.   The short answer  is that the  Cepulonis suit was  a\n                                                 \n\nclass action concerning law  library access of inmates housed\n\nin the DSU.  It did not speak to the DDU which, we recognize,\n          \n\nhad not yet been created.  But, by the same token, an alleged\n\nfailure to  comply with  the stipulation in  Cepulonis (which\n                                                      \n\naddresses the DSU) may  be a questionable thread on  which to\n\nhang a claim regarding the contours of the entitlement of the\n\nlaw library access in the DDU.\n\n     The  record  indicates  that an  inmate  in  the  DDU is\n\npermitted a minimum of  two hours access per  week to a  book\n\ncart with a  selection of starter volumes6; may  request from\n\n                    \n\n6.

A DDU  inmate is permitted  access to the  \"DDU [Legal]\n\nResearch  Area,\" whereas  an  inmate in  isolation \"will  not\n\nnormally  be allowed Research Area access.\"  SRA at p. 38-40.\n\nThe district court did  not err in granting  summary judgment\n\nto the defendants on McGuinness' claim that a sentence to the\n\nDDU is a sentence to an isolation unit.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The  order  of  the  district  court   granting  summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants is affirmed.\n                                                \n\n                             -15-\n</pre>",
