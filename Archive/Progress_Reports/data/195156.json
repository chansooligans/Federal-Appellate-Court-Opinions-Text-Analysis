The parties in  this action\n                                  \n\nattempted to negotiate a long-term distribution relationship, but\n\nafter a  year of  haggling, defendant  Welch Foods, Inc.  (Welch)\n\nnotified plaintiffs R.W. International Corp. (R.W.) and T.H. Ward\n\nde  la  Cruz,  Inc.,1  that  it was  calling  off  the  corporate\n\nmarriage  because  of  irreconcilable  differences.    Plaintiffs\n\nclaimed that  the dissolution  of the  relationship violated  the\n\nPuerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,   278\n\n(Law 75), and federal and  state antitrust laws.  Plaintiffs also\n\nalleged  a  claim  of   tortious  interference  with  contractual\n\nrelations against defendant  Magna Trading  Corp., supervisor  of\n\nWelch's operations in Puerto Rico.\n\n     The district  court concluded that  the association  between\n\nthe parties had not yet  matured into a relationship protected by\n\nLaw   75,  and  it  consequently  granted  summary  judgment  for\n\ndefendants on the Dealers' Act and tort claims.  It dismissed the\n\nantitrust claims on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to make\n\nthe required showing of injury to competition.  Our review of the\n\ncaselaw  and circumstances persuades  us that only  the antitrust\n\nclaims properly were dismissed.  We therefore reverse the summary\n\njudgment on the other causes of action.\n\n                    \n\n     1  These  two  related corporations  are  both  in  the food\ndistribution business.  According to answers to  interrogatories,\nR.W.  does marketing for mainland corporations and accounting for\nDe la Cruz, Inc..   De la Cruz, in turn, distributes but does not\npurchase  products from producers.  It makes purchases from Impex\nTrading, another related  company.

Factual Background\n                                           \n\n          The  facts  underlying  this  dispute  essentially  are\n\nundisputed, with the parties differing only with respect to their\n\nlegal significance.  Our review  of the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment is  plenary.   Cambridge Plating  Co. v.  Napco,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 991 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1993).\n    \n\n     Welch, a producer of fruit  juices and related products, has\n\nsold its products through local distributors in Puerto Rico since\n\nthe  1930s.   In 1987,  Welch needed  a new  distributor for  its\n\nfrozen concentrate  line of products,  and, with the help  of its\n\nlocal  broker,  Magna Trading,  it  identified R.W.  as  the most\n\nsuitable -- though not perfect -- candidate.\n\n     From  the beginning  of Welch's  interest  in R.W.,  company\n\nexecutives had concerns about R.W.'s handling a competing line of\n\njuice   products  under  the   \"Donald  Duck\"  label.     Welch's\n\ninternational   marketing   manager   initially   had   suggested\n\ninternally that R.W. would  have to drop the Donald Duck line \"to\n\nbe a viable option,\" see App. at 213, but he later  reported that\n                        \n\nR.W.'s  owner, Thomas  Ward,  had  agreed  to  undertake  several\n\nmeasures  to  assure  that the  Welch  frozen  concentrates would\n\nreceive full support despite the continued presence of the Donald\n\nDuck  products.    These  included  \"[a]  trial  period  with  no\n\ncommitment by  Welch's for  a larger  period of  representation,\"\n\nApp.   at  219,  and  a  financial  contribution  from  R.W.  for\n\nadvertising Welch's product.\n\n                               -3-\n\n     Discussion  among the parties  took place through  the early\n\nmonths of 1988 and, on March 25, Welch's  international marketing\n\nmanager wrote to Ward to announce his company's decision:\n\n          . . .  I am pleased to inform you that Welch's has\n     reached a decision to  continue the frozen  concentrate\n     distribution  and  sales  business  begun  by   Ventura\n     Rodriguez in Puerto Rico by transferring our account to\n     R.W. International.\n\n          Confirming  our  conversation on  Monday,  Welch's\n     will  proceed to  draft an  agreement  calling for  the\n     appointment  of R.W. International in Puerto Rico for a\n     one-year trial period . . . .   \n\nApp. at 364.   Four days later,  on March 29, Welch  notified its\n\ncustomers that it had\n\n     made the decision to appoint R.W. International and its\n     distributing affiliate T.H. Ward de la Cruz Inc. as its\n     distributors in Puerto Rico  for Welch's frozen product\n     line.  This change will go  into effect as of this date\n     and a written agreement is expected to be arrived at in\n     the near future.\n\nApp. at 366 (translation in appendix to appellant's brief).\n\n      The   parties  immediately   began  doing   business,  with\n\nplaintiffs regularly  submitting purchase  orders and  defendants\n\ndelivering the merchandise  and billing plaintiffs.   It was  not\n\nuntil  three months  later,  however, in  late  June, that  Welch\n\nsubmitted  a proposed contract to plaintiffs.   Ward responded in\n\nAugust  with a  counterproposal.   Of particular  concern  to the\n\nPuerto  Rico  company  were  provisions  in  the  agreement  that\n\nappeared to  reflect an effort by  Welch to bypass  Act 75, which\n\nsubjects  companies  to  substantial damages  if  they  terminate\n\ndealership  contracts for  other than  \"just  cause.\"   The Welch\n\ndocument,  for example, characterized  the relationship with R.W.\n\n                               -4-\n\nas a  transfer of  the contractual  arrangement that  had existed\n\nbetween Welch  and its prior  distributors before the  passage of\n\nAct 75.   Welch's draft also  specified that New  York law  would\n\ngovern the agreement.  R.W.'s revised draft,  inter alia, deleted\n                                                        \n\nthe \"transfer\"  language and specified that Puerto Rico law would\n\napply.\n\n     In  mid-October, after  a series of  telephone conversations\n\nbetween attorneys, Welch submitted a  third proposed draft of the\n\nagreement, which reinstated all of  the language that had been of\n\nprimary concern  to R.W.  During a visit  to Puerto Rico in early\n\nDecember and in subsequent correspondence, Welch's  international\n\nmarketing  manager  encouraged  Ward  to  complete  the  contract\n\nnegotiations \"as  soon as possible.\"   On January 30,  1989, Ward\n\nresponded by letter stating that he, too, was anxious to finalize\n\nthe agreement, but  that there were a few items \"that your lawyer\n\ninsists  on and that we feel are not  in the best interest of our\n\nfuture relationship.\"   In  response to  an inquiry  about R.W.'s\n\ninvesting $50,000 in a promotional campaign, Ward noted that  the\n\ncommitment  was not yet  ripe because he had  agreed to make this\n\nexpenditure \"once we as a company[] held a working agreement with\n\nWelch's.\"  A follow-up  letter sent by Ward on February  8 to the\n\npresident  of  Magna  Trading   reiterated  concerns  about   the\n\n\"transfer\" concept as a means of \"avoid[ing] Law 75 constraints.\"\n\n     At this point, the applicability of Law 75 remained the only\n\nsignificant  point   of  contractual  disagreement   between  the\n\n                               -5-\n\nparties.   They  had resolved  earlier conflicts  as to  which of\n\nWard's entities would be named specifically in the contract (only\n\nR.W.), and whether  R.W. would have an  exclusive distributorship\n\nduring the one-year trial period (no).\n\n     The  companies had been continuing to do business throughout\n\nthe negotiation period.  Late in  1988, the relationship appeared\n\nto  be working  well; Magna  Trading's  president, Roberto  Giro,\n\nwrote to Ward in early  December to commend him for exceeding  by\n\n11 percent  the goal on  a special product  promotion.  Early  in\n\n1989, however, Giro  began to express concern  about R.W.'s side-\n\nby-side  handling of  the Welch  and  Donald Duck  products.   On\n\nJanuary  20, he  wrote to  Welch's  marketing manager  indicating\n\ndiscomfort with Ward's  involvement in a new line  of Donald Duck\n\ngrape  juice products.   This  concern escalated, and  Giro wrote\n\nagain on March 22 suggesting that R.W. was not giving priority to\n\nWelch products as it had promised to do.\n\n     On  March 30,  1989, Welch's  international vice  president,\n\nWilliam Hewins, informed Ward in a letter of Welch's decision \"to\n\ndiscontinue  the existing  pre-trial  relationship  .  .  .  and,\n\ntherefore,  putting an end to the  one-year trial or probationary\n\nrelationship  for our frozen  concentrate products.\"   The letter\n\ncontinued:\n\n     As you know, the idea of working together on a one-year\n     trial  basis  was,  as  per  your  recommendations,  to\n     determine  if  Welch's  frozen  concentrates  could  be\n     handled to our satisfaction in spite of your handling a\n     competitive product.  The pre-trial relationship proved\n     to   us  that  the   conflicts  of  interest   of  your\n     representing both  competing lines are  significant and\n     irreconcilable. . . . An increased level of conflict in\n\n                               -6-\n\n     personal   relations  between   our  broker   and  R.W.\n     International has also been noted, tracing to conflicts\n     between the brands represented by  the two firms. . . .\n     Instead  of  complementing  one  another,  as  was your\n     original  premise, these  brands represent  conflicting\n     interests for you and us. . . .\n\nBecause  Welch  terminated  the relationship  before  the parties\n\nreached  an agreement  in  writing,  the  one-year  trial  period\n\nenvisioned at the outset of their dealings never even commenced.\n\n     Plaintiffs  filed this action in  April 1989.  Their amended\n\ncomplaint   alleges  that   Welch  terminated   their  dealership\n\nagreement without just  cause in violation of Law  75; that Magna\n\nTrading tortiously interfered with their contractual relationship\n\nwith  Welch; and  that  defendants  violated  antitrust  laws  by\n\nthreatening,  and then  later  actually terminating,  plaintiffs'\n\ndealership if  R.W. did not  agree to drop Donald  Duck products,\n\nand  by seeking  to  monopolize the  bottled  grape juice  market\n\nthrough  a price-cutting  war.   The case  was dismissed  once on\n\nimproper  procedural grounds,  see  R.W. International  Corp.  v.\n                                                             \n\nWelch Foods,  Inc., 937 F.2d  11 (1st Cir. 1991),  and, following\n                  \n\nremand,  dismissed  again  on  defendants'  motions  for  summary\n\njudgment.\n\n     In this appeal, plaintiffs maintain that all of their claims\n\nare viable.   They argue  that, contrary to the  district court's\n\nruling,  precedent on  Law 75 establishes  that the  statute does\n                                                                 \n\ngovern  the business  relationship within  which  R.W. and  Welch\n\noperated  for a  year.   They assert  that this  arrangement also\n\nprovides  a basis for  their tortious interference  claim against\n\nMagna.   In  addition,  plaintiffs  argue  that  their  antitrust\n\n                               -7-\n\nallegations  were  sufficient  to withstand  defendants'  summary\n\njudgment motion  and that, if  their showing were  deficient, the\n\ncourt  erred  in  dismissing the  claims  without  first allowing\n\ndiscovery.\n\n                   II. Applicability of Law 75\n                                              \n\n     Law  75  provides  that,   notwithstanding  any  contractual\n\nprovision  to  the  contrary,  the  supplier  in  a  distribution\n\ncontract may terminate a dealership  only for \"just cause.\"  P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 10,   278a.2   The statute was intended to protect\n\nPuerto  Rico  dealers  from  the  harm  caused  when  a  supplier\n\narbitrarily  terminates  a distributorship  once  the  dealer has\n\ncreated a  favorable market  for the  supplier's products,  \"thus\n\nfrustrating the  legitimate expectations and  interests of  those\n\nwho  so efficiently carried out their responsibilities,\" Medina &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nMedina v. Country  Pride Foods, Ltd., 858 F.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988) (reproducing  in full  translation of  Puerto Rico  Supreme\n\nCourt's response to certified question,  122 P.R. Dec. 172 (1988)\n\n(citing  legislative reports)).   The Act  has been  described as\n\n\"very much  a `one-way street'  designed to protect  dealers from\n\nthe unwarranted  acts of  termination by  suppliers,\" Nike  Int'l\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     2 The provision states in full:\n\n          Notwithstanding  the   existence  in   a  dealer's\n     contract  of  a  clause reserving  to  the  parties the\n     unilateral    right   to    terminate   the    existing\n     relationship, no principal  or grantor may  directly or\n     indirectly   perform  any   act   detrimental  to   the\n     established  relationship  or  refuse   to  renew  said\n     contract on  its  normal expiration,  except  for  just\n     cause.\n\n                               -8-\n\nLtd. v.  Athletic Sales,  Inc., 689 F.  Supp. 1235,  1237 (D.P.R.\n                              \n\n1988).\n\n     For  purposes of its summary  judgment motion, Welch did not\n\ndispute   that  R.W.  and  its  affiliates  were  performing  the\n\nfunctions of  a distributor within  the meaning of Law  75 during\n\nthe twelve months the parties  were doing business, see P.R. Laws\n                                                       \n\nAnn. tit.  10,    278(a).3   Welch's position  was, and is,  that\n\nthese operations occurred during a kind of \"twilight zone\" period\n\nwhile the parties attempted to  negotiate in good faith the terms\n\nthat  would  govern  their  actual  relationship.    Because  the\n\nnegotiations failed, the relationship never materialized, and so,\n\nin Welch's view, Law 75 never was implicated.\n\n     The district  court accepted this  argument, concluding that\n\nLaw  75 was  not  meant  to  apply to  a  period  of  preliminary\n\nnegotiations preceding  a completed  working agreement between  a\n\nsupplier  and  distributor.     The  court  noted   that  keeping\n\noperations in  abeyance during  a good-faith  negotiating process\n\n\"would  allow distributors  to sit and  wait while  the principal\n\nloses its  market -- obtaining,  literally without any  effort, a\n\nstronger  bargaining position every day it  waits.\"  Applying Law\n\n75 to dealings  during that period,  however, \"would curtail  the\n\nautonomy  required   for  arms-length  negotiations.\"     Neither\n\n                    \n\n     3 This  provision defines a  \"dealer\" as a  \"person actually\ninterested  in  a   dealer's  contract  because  of   his  having\neffectively  in his  charge  in  Puerto  Rico  the  distribution,\nagency,  concession or representation  of a given  merchandise or\nservice.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\napproach  would serve  the statute's  purpose  of \"improving  and\n\npermitting a system of free competition.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs' challenge to  this judgment is  straightforward.\n\nLaw 75 makes no distinctions  among distributorship arrangements,\n\nthey  assert,  be  they  described  as   pre-trial,  preliminary,\n\ntemporary or  tentative.  The  only relevant point of  inquiry is\n\nwhether R.W. and its affiliates were performing as a dealer under\n\nthe  statute; if so,  Law 75 governs.   R.W.  thus contends that,\n\nbecause Welch concedes  dealer status, its decision  to terminate\n\nthe relationship must be judged  under the statute's \"just cause\"\n\ntest.\n\n     We  are persuaded that  plaintiffs' position is  the correct\n\none.  Their most compelling  support is provided by the statutory\n\nlanguage, which defines a  \"dealer's contract\" subject to Law  75\n\nas:  [a]  relationship established  between a  dealer  and a\n     principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively  of the\n                                                            \n     manner in which  the parties may call,  characterize or\n                                                            \n     execute  such  relationship,  the  former actually  and\n                                \n     effectively  takes  charge  of the  distribution  of  a\n     merchandise,  or  of  the rendering  of  a  service, by\n     concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,    278(b) (emphasis added).  The  statute\n\nclearly incorporates within  its reach any arrangement  between a\n                                          \n\nsupplier  and dealer  in  which  the dealer  is  actually in  the\n\nprocess  of  distributing  the supplier's  merchandise  in Puerto\n\nRico.  The statute does  not apply to suppliers' simple  sales to\n\nPuerto Rican wholesalers.   It  insists upon  establishment of  a\n\n\"supplier/dealer\" relationship.   But once  that relationship  is\n\nestablished,  the statute applies  irrespective of the  length of\n\n                               -10-\n\ntime such an arrangement has been in existence, and it explicitly\n\nrejects any efforts by the parties to foreclose  coverage through\n\nsemantic niceties.  Welch's concession  that R.W. was acting as a\n\ndealer (for purposes of summary judgment) thus seems dispositive.\n\n     Welch, however, asserts that the  statute is not meant to be\n\nas  inclusive  as its  language suggests,  and it  offers several\n\nreasons to support this position.  In our view, each falters upon\n\nclose scrutiny.\n\n     First,  Welch  claims  that the  word  \"established\"  in the\n\nprovision indicates  that Law  75 applies  only once  the parties\n\nhave achieved a certain level of stability.  The  parties in this\n\ncase may have  been working with each other,  Welch observes, but\n\ntheir  failure to reach  agreement on essential  terms meant that\n\ntheir  relationship was never \"established\" within the meaning of\n\nLaw 75.  In support of  this argument, Welch cites language  from\n\ncases describing the Law 75 relationship as \"characterized by its\n\ncontinuity, stability,  mutual trust,  coordination between  both\n\nparties as independent  entrepreneurs,\" J.

See Medina  &amp; Medina,\n                                                                \n\n858   F.2d  at  820  (Act  75  levels  bargaining  power  between\n\nmanufacturer  and dealer \"[i]n order to achieve reasonably stable\n\ndealership  relationships   in  Puerto  Rico\").     Although  the\n\nprecedent  cited  by  Welch describes  the  type  of longstanding\n\ncommercial  partnership that gave rise to  Law 75, we do not read\n\nthe  cases  to  exclude fledgling  relationships  from  the act's\n\ncoverage.  A well-established dealer may have more to lose -- and\n\nmay have  provided more benefit to the  supplier -- than a dealer\n\nwith less tenure,  but the statute  makes no distinction  between\n\nthem.     \n\n     Nor can it be said that a relationship is established within\n\nthe  meaning  of  Law 75  only  if  it is  committed  to writing.\n\nIndeed,  Welch's counsel  acknowledged at  oral  argument that  a\n\nrelationship subject to the statute may be established  through a\n\ncourse  of dealing,  but argued  that this  was not  such a  case\n\nbecause  the parties  continued to  disagree  over the  essential\n\nterms of their affiliation throughout their entire collaboration.\n\nIn other words,  Welch contends  that this  relationship was  not\n\nestablished because its terms still were being negotiated.\n\n                               -12-\n\n     While it is  true that the parties  had yet to agree  on the\n\ndimensions  of their future  relationship, the fact  remains that\n\nthey were operating  as business partners under some  terms for a\n                                                    \n\nfull   year.     Plaintiffs  sent   purchase   orders  to   Welch\n\napproximately once a week between  March 1988 and March 1989, and\n\nWard's  companies were  actively  involved in  distributing Welch\n\nproducts throughout that  time.  As noted above,  Ward received a\n\ncommendation from Magna  Trading's president for its  effort in a\n\nsuccessful  special  promotion.   To  be  sure,  the relationship\n\nenvisioned by  the parties when  they began to do  business never\n\nmaterialized;  the relationship protected by Law 75, however, was\n\nthe one that actually existed.\n\n     Welch's  second  argument,  that applying  Law  75  during a\n\nperiod  of   preliminary  negotiations  improperly   burdens  the\n\nparties' liberty to contract, is the one the district court found\n\nparticularly  convincing.  When parties freely have agreed that a\n\ntrial  period   will  precede  establishment  of   the  long-term\n\nrelationship Law 75 is intended to protect, the company  asserts,\n\ninvoking  the  Act  before  conclusion of  the  trial  period  is\n\ntantamount to coercing the parties into a contract neither agreed\n\nto enter.   This is  particularly harmful to the  supplier, Welch\n\nmaintains, because Law 75 is  designed to empower dealers.  Thus,\n\na supplier who is not  allowed to step away from  an unsuccessful\n\nattempted  relationship  would  be   forced  into  accepting  the\n\ndealer's  terms and conditions,  with the consequent  loss of its\n\nfinancial and legal autonomy.\n\n                               -13-\n\n     We detect several problems with this argument.  In the first\n\nplace, as we have noted, the parties in this case were not simply\n\nnegotiating  a relationship  to  be  activated  sometime  in  the\n\nfuture.  R.W.  had been serving as Welch's Puerto Rico dealer for\n\ntwelve months.   While we  would have no difficulty  in accepting\n\nthat a supplier could break  off negotiations, no matter how long\n\nthey had been going on, the issue before us is whether  Welch can\n\nterminate  an   actual  dealership   relationship  that   existed\n\ncontemporaneously with the negotiations.  Welch wants to insulate\n\nthose dealings  from Law 75 because  they were part of  a longer-\n\nterm  plan.    The  statute,  however,  plainly  states that  the\n\ncharacterization of a relationship (e.g., calling it temporary or\n\npreliminary) does  not affect its  status under  Law 75.   If the\n\nparties are dealing, a dealership exists for purposes of the Act.\n\n     This  bright line makes  sense.  Otherwise,  suppliers could\n\ninsist  on various types of contingency arrangements to avoid Law\n\n75's  restrictions for  substantial periods  of  time.   Although\n\nWelch's concerns about R.W.'s capacity  to perform in the face of\n\na  potential conflict of  interest seem legitimate,  delaying Law\n\n75's  coverage until long after the dealership relationship began\n\nwould allow Welch to terminate for any reason whatsoever.  Welch,\n\nfor  example, could  forsake R.W.  without  recourse and  without\n\nregard  for any  efforts taken  by R.W.  to  gear up  for Welch's\n\nbusiness,  if  another   dealer  willing  to  accept   a  smaller\n\ncommission suddenly became  available.  Moreover, there  seems to\n\nbe  no  principled  distinction  between  Welch's one-year  trial\n\n                               -14-\n\nperiod  and a  supplier's effort  to designate  a three-  or even\n\nfive-year \"preliminary\"  distributorship  before  deciding  on  a\n\nlong-term relationship.   To rule that a  contingent relationship\n\nis  outside the scope  of Law 75  is thus to  allow a significant\n\nloophole in  the protection the Puerto Rico legislature sought to\n\nprovide.\n\n     In the  second place, we fail to see  how applying Law 75 in\n\nthe circumstances of this case necessarily would require Welch to\n\ncontinue a relationship it does not want  in a manner to which it\n\nhas serious  objections.   Law 75 simply  requires a  supplier to\n\njustify  its decision  to  terminate a  dealership.   If  Welch's\n\nconflict-of-interest concerns about R.W. are legitimate,  we have\n\nno doubt  that this would  constitute \"just cause\" under  Law 75.\n\nSee Medina &amp;  Medina, 858 F.2d at 823-24.4  Thus, applying Law 75\n                    \n\nhere does not force a  contract onto unwilling parties; it simply\n\nimposes conditions on an existing relationship.\n\n     Finally, the  liberty of contract argument  stumbles insofar\n\nas it presumes that  only the supplier will  suffer if, to  avoid\n\n                    \n\n     4  Medina &amp;  Medina is  not  precisely on  point because  it\n                        \ninvolved  a  supplier's  decision to  totally  withdraw  from the\nPuerto Rico market following  good-faith negotiations that failed\nto achieve agreement between the parties.  There is no indication\nhere that Welch intended  to leave the market rather than  find a\nnew  dealer.  Nevertheless,  we believe the  principle underlying\nMedina &amp;  Medina is  equally applicable  in these  circumstances,\n                \ni.e.,  that a  supplier has  just cause  to  terminate if  it has\nbargained  in  good faith  but has  not  been able  \"to  reach an\nagreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of\nthe dealership,\" 858  F.2d at 824.   This would be true  at least\nwhere, as  here, the  supplier's market in  Puerto Rico  was well\nestablished  before  the  current  dealer  relationship  and  the\nsupplier's action  therefore \"is  not aimed  at reaping  the good\nwill or clientele established by the dealer,\" id.\n                                                 \n\n                               -15-\n\napplication of  Law 75,  the parties  refrain from  dealing until\n\nthey have  reached final agreement  on all terms to  govern their\n\nlong-term relationship.  The manufacturer and the dealer share an\n\ninterest in maximizing sales of the  product, and it would be  no\n\nmore to the  dealer's advantage than to the  manufacturer's for a\n\nmarket to slip  away while the parties are  engaged in protracted\n\nnegotiations.   We therefore  disagree with the  district court's\n\nview that dealers will gain unfair advantage in bargaining if Law\n\n75 is triggered as soon as the parties start dealing.  Both sides\n\nhave an  incentive to  reach agreement  at the  earliest possible\n\ntime.    To  the  extent  a  supplier's  future   flexibility  is\n\ndiminished by its choice to  begin dealing before all issues have\n\nbeen resolved, this  is a result intended by  the legislators who\n\nenacted Law 75.\n\n     In  short, the practical  effect of activating  the Dealers'\n\nAct as soon as the  parties start conducting business as supplier\n\nand  dealer  is  to  ensure  that,  right  from  the  start,  the\n\nrelationship is marked by a  certain level of commitment from the\n\nsupplier.    This does  not  entirely  deprive suppliers  of  the\n\nopportunity to  evaluate the  suitability of  a particular  match\n\nthrough a \"test  period.\"  It simply means  that the relationship\n\ncan be severed without consequence  only for just cause, i.e., if\n\nthe  dealer fails  a meaningful  test.   This should  not trouble\n\nsuppliers engaged in  good-faith negotiations, for their  goal is\n\nto produce a long-term working agreement.  If, on the other hand,\n\na  preliminary \"understanding\"  disintegrates  into impasse  over\n\n                               -16-\n\nessential terms,  a finding of \"just cause\" seems likely.  Law 75\n\nis  not intended to extend unworkable  relationships, but only to\n\nprevent arbitrary terminations.  See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n823-24.\n\n     Of course,  whether or not  statutes of this kind  are sound\n\npolicy is not our concern.  Perhaps a case can be made for having\n\na  fixed period during which the relationship is probationary and\n\nthe  statutory rights under  Law 75 do not  vest; this is typical\n\nfor  tenure  arrangements  in government  employment  and  in the\n\nacademic  world.   But the  legislature  has not  enacted such  a\n\nwindow, as we  read the present statute, and it is  not for us to\n\namend the statute in the guise of construction.\n\n     Welch's effort to  bolster its position through  reliance on\n\nMedina  &amp;  Medina and  another  case  involving  a novel  Law  75\n                 \n\nquestion, Nike Int'l  Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc.,  689 F. Supp.\n                                                  \n\n1235  (D.P.R. 1988),  is unavailing.    In Medina  &amp; Medina,  the\n                                                           \n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court held  that a supplier may withdraw from\n\nthe Puerto Rico  market without consequence under Law  75 if \"the\n\nparties  have bargained in  good faith but have  not been able to\n\nreach an agreement  as to price, credit, or  some other essential\n\nelement of the dealership,\" 858 F.2d at 824.  Welch contends that\n\nthe district court's ruling, allowing the company to call off the\n\nprotracted, unsuccessful  negotiations with R.W., is  faithful to\n\nthat decision.\n\n     In Medina &amp;  Medina, however, the Puerto Rico  Supreme Court\n                        \n\ndid not rule that a  temporary relationship pending completion of\n\n                               -17-\n\nnegotiations is outside the scope of Law 75, but it held that the\n\nfailed negotiations  over price  and credit  terms provided  just\n                                                                 \n\ncause   for   the   supplier's    decision   to   terminate   the\n     \n\ndistributorship a year  after it began.5  Until that case, it was\n\nunclear  whether a supplier  could terminate  without consequence\n\nfor any reason other than the dealer's adverse actions.  Medina &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nMedina does help Welch, in that it allows an argument that failed\n      \n\nnegotiations may support  a finding of \"just cause,\"  but it does\n\nnot bolster the company's argument that preliminary dealings fall\n\noutside Law 75.\n\n     In Nike, a federal district court permitted termination of a\n            \n\ndealer  who failed  to give  the  contractually required  written\n\nnotice to the supplier of its intent to renew the contract.   689\n\nF.  Supp.  at 1239.    According to  Welch,  Nike stands  for the\n                                                 \n\nprinciple  that  dealers  may  not  avoid the  express  terms  of\n\nagreements  to which they willingly subscribe.  Consequently, the\n\ncompany  argues, the district  court properly held  appellants to\n\ntheir  own characterization of  the arrangement as  a preliminary\n\ntest period.\n\n     This  argument  stretches  Nike  far  beyond  its legitimate\n                                    \n\nboundaries.  Nike addressed only whether Law 75 released a dealer\n                 \n\nfrom   an   explicit   renewal   procedure   contained   in   the\n\ndistributorship  contract.  Noting that the statute's purpose was\n\nto  protect against unjustified termination by the principal, the\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n     5  The dealership  contract  between  Medina  &amp;  Medina  and\nCountry Pride contained  no time limit.  Product  prices were set\nperiodically by mutual agreement.  858 F.2d at 818.\n\n                               -18-\n\ncourt ruled that it had no effect on mutual agreements specifying\n\nthe manner in which a dealer must notify a supplier of its desire\n\nto continue their  relationship.  See 689  F. Supp. at 1239.   In\n                                     \n\nother words, while  Law 75 takes away from the supplier the right\n\nto make a subjective decision  to terminate, other than for \"just\n\ncause,\" the parties  may agree  to a  contractual procedure  that\n\ngives  the dealer  the power  either to  end or  to  continue the\n                 \n\nrelationship after a given period  of time.  Nike holds that  Law\n                                                 \n\n75 does  not protect the  dealer from its  own failure to  follow\n\nthat procedure.\n\n     This  case is  simply not  equivalent  to Nike.   Welch,  in\n                                                   \n\nessence, claims that the parties agreed that Welch would have the\n\npower  to terminate their  relationship after a  preliminary test\n\nperiod,  without  regard  to  just  cause.    This,  however,  is\n\nprecisely the  imbalance of power  to which Law 75  was directed,\n\nand the statute invalidates  such an agreement.  Under Law  75, a\n\nprincipal  may  not  wield unilateral  authority  to  terminate a\n\ndealership relationship for other than just cause.\n\n     In sum, we find no  basis upon which to exclude the  ongoing\n\ncommercial dealings  between Welch and  R.W. from the  embrace of\n\nLaw 75.  The district court's grant of summary judgment therefore\n\nmust be reversed so that the court may consider whether Welch had\n\n\"just  cause\" for terminating the relationship.6  Because summary\n\njudgment   on  the  claim   for  tortious  interference   with  a\n\n                    \n\n     6 We recognize  that Welch conceded that R.W. was performing\nas a dealer only for purposes of its summary judgment motion, and\nthat, consequently, this issue also may surface again on remand.\n\n                               -19-\n\ncontractual relation  was premised  on the  Law 75  holding, that\n\ndecision   also  must  be   vacated  and  remanded   for  further\n\nconsideration.  The  remand on the tortious interference claim is\n\nwithout prejudice  to  any argument  Welch  may be  making  that,\n\nregardless of  the existence of  a relationship protected  by Law\n\n75,   there   was   no   contract   protected   against  tortious\n\ninterference.\n\n                      III. Antitrust Claims\n                                           \n\n     In January  1989, R.W. introduced a new  Donald Duck bottled\n\ngrape  juice  into  the  market  with  an  intensive  promotional\n\ncampaign.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants' reaction to the new\n\nproduct, and R.W.'s representation of it, violated sections 1 and\n\n2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.     1, 2, as well as Commonwealth\n\nantitrust  law, P.R.  Laws  Ann.  tit.  10,     258,  260.    The\n\nprincipal  actions cited by plaintiffs in their amended complaint\n\nwere  (1) discussions in  which Welch and  Magna expressed \"anger\n\n(`molestia'),  discomfort  and   preoccupation  with  Plaintiffs'\n\nhandling  of  the  `Donald Duck'  bottled  grape  juice,\" Amended\n\nComplaint  at    78;  (2) a  \"massive  promotional campaign\"  for\n\nWelch's own  bottled grape  juice, and a  price cutting  war, \"in\n\norder to  block out the  entrance [of] the `Donald  Duck' bottled\n\ngrape juice into the Puerto Rican market,\" id. at    82,  91; and\n                                              \n\n(3) the  decision of  Welch to  terminate  its relationship  with\n\nplaintiffs because R.W. did not drop representation of the Donald\n\nDuck juice, id. at   81.\n               \n\n                               -20-\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment on these claims,\n\nconcluding  that plaintiffs had  failed to demonstrate  a genuine\n\nissue   of  material  fact  as  to  whether  defendants'  actions\n\nconstituted   either  a  conspiracy  in  restraint  of  trade  in\n\nviolation of   1  of the Sherman Act,7 or an  unlawful conspiracy\n\nto monopolize  the bottled grape  juice market in violation  of  \n\n2.8   Of  greatest significance  to the  court was  a declaration\n\nfrom  one  of  Magna's principals,  Francisco  Gil,  stating that\n\nDonald Duck  bottled products had reached, within  a short period\n\nof time,  at least  80 percent of  the stores  typically carrying\n\nsuch products.  The court  found that summary judgment was proper\n\nbecause  \"plaintiffs never  responded to  Welch's  claim that  []\n\ncompetition  has  not  been  injured, and  that  the  Donald Duck\n\nbottled grape juice  was successfully introduced into  the Puerto\n\nRico market.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs claim  on appeal  that the  court improperly  and\n\nprematurely  dismissed their  antitrust claims.    Much of  their\n\nbrief  on  this issue,  however,  is devoted  to  an off-the-mark\n\nargument  concerning the court's failure to treat the allegations\n\nin  their complaint  liberally.   The court  did not  dismiss the\n\n                    \n\n     7 Section 1 makes unlawful \"[e]very contract, combination in\nthe form  of trust or  otherwise, or conspiracy, in  restraint of\ntrade  or commerce  among  the several  States,  or with  foreign\nnations . . . .\" 15 U.S.C.   1.\n\n     8  Section  2  makes  it   an  offense  for  any  person  to\n\"monopolize, or  attempt to  monopolize, or  combine or  conspire\nwith any other person  or persons, to monopolize any  part of the\ntrade  or commerce  among  the several  States,  or with  foreign\nnations . . . .\"  15 U.S.C.   2.\n\n                               -21-\n\nantitrust  claims  based   on  the  pleadings,  but   ruled  that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to substantiate in any way their conclusory\n\nallegations in  response to  defendants' summary  judgment motion\n\nand accompanying declaration.  Our review of the district court's\n\ndecision  consequently focuses solely  on the  appropriateness of\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n     Section 1 of the  Sherman Act.  As  argued by plaintiffs  in\n                                  \n\ntheir  appellate  brief,  the  unreasonable  restraint  of  trade\n\nunderlying their    1 claim  was an alleged  threat by Welch  (as\n\npart  of  a  conspiracy  with  Magna)  to  terminate  plaintiffs'\n                                    \n\ndealership  and  the   subsequent  actual   termination  of   the\n\nrelationship.  These  actions presumably were alleged  to violate\n\nthe antitrust laws based on their impact in pressuring plaintiffs\n\nto  drop the  Donald Duck  line of products,  thereby suppressing\n\ncompetition among grape juice manufacturers.\n\n     Heavy-handed competitive tactics alone  do not constitute an\n\nantitrust  violation, however.  To survive defendants' motion for\n\nsummary  judgment,  plaintiffs needed  to  demonstrate  a genuine\n\ndispute as  to whether  defendants' actions  caused an  injury to\n\ncompetition,  as distinguished from  impact on themselves.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Spectrum  Sports, Inc.  v. McQuillan, 113  S.

See\n                                                                 \n\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

During the last  months of 1988  R.W. International\n     Corp.  became the broker  of Donald Duck  bottled grape\n     juice.\n\n     3. Shortly after the introduction  in the market of the\n     Donald Duck  bottled  grape  juice,  Welch's  began  an\n     intensive  promotion  of  their   bottled  grape  juice\n     products.\n\n     4.  This  intensive  promotion  of  the  Welch's  Grape\n     bottled  products caused  []  the introduction  of  the\n     Donald Duck bottled grape juice be severely suppressed.\n\n     5. Upon information  and believe [sic], this  intensive\n     promotion  was carried  out in  conjunction  with Magna\n     Trading  Corporation  to  eliminate   the  Donald  Duck\n     bottled grape juice from [the] Puerto Rico market.\n\n     The  district  court  concluded   that  this  statement  was\n\ninsufficient to  generate a  genuine factual  dispute because  it\n\nleft unchallenged  defendants'  assertion that  the  Donald  Duck\n\n                               -23-\n\nbottled juice had deeply penetrated the Puerto Rico market during\n\nthe period  of defendants'  allegedly unlawful  conspiracy.   The\n\ncourt observed:\n\n     [A]s  the  Puerto Rico  Supreme  Court  has recognized,\n     distributors  are  in   contact  with  the   retailers,\n     consumers,  and the different  components of the trade.\n     Medina, 817  F.2d at 823  n.6.  Plaintiffs were  in the\n           \n     position  to  show,  based on  their  knowledge  of the\n     Puerto Rico market,  the effects of Welch's  conduct on\n     the market . .  . .  However, other than the conclusory\n     allegation   that   their  line   had   been  \"severely\n     suppressed,\"  plaintiffs  never  responded  to  Welch's\n     claim  that the competition  has not been  injured, and\n     that   the  Donald   Duck  bottled   grape  juice   was\n     successfully introduced into the Puerto Rico market.\n\n     The   district   court's   decision   and  explanation   are\n\nunimpeachable.   Plaintiffs may  have felt pressured  to drop the\n\nDonald Duck products  in order to preserve  the Welch dealership,\n\nand may have suffered economic consequences from Welch's decision\n\nto terminate, but  these circumstances are irrelevant  insofar as\n\nan  antitrust violation  is concerned.    Plaintiffs' failure  to\n\nrebut  defendants' assertion that Donald Duck bottled grape juice\n\nhad no problem entering the  market -- an implicit assertion that\n\ncompetition  was not  affected --  fully  justifies the  district\n                    \n\ncourt's decision to grant summary judgment for defendants.\n\n     Plaintiffs take  issue with the significance  of defendants'\n\npenetration  figure, arguing  that each  of  the stores  carrying\n\nDonald Duck juice may have had only a single bottle of that brand\n\nwhile displaying shelves  full of Welch products.   We agree with\n\nthe  district court,  however, that  such  information, if  true,\n\ncould have been obtained easily by plaintiffs, and its absence is\n\n                               -24-\n\nthus not a  proper basis upon which to  withhold summary judgment\n\nfrom defendants.9  See infra at 24-25 (denial of discovery).\n                            \n\n     Section  2  of the  Sherman  Act.    Plaintiffs'    2  claim\n                                     \n\ncharacterizes  defendants' promotional  campaign, in  which Welch\n\nreduced prices  on its bottled  grape juice, as  an impermissible\n\neffort to gain monopoly control of the bottled grape juice market\n\nin Puerto Rico.   In light of R.W.'s  success in introducing  the\n\nDonald Duck juice, this claim is wholly without merit.\n\n     The Supreme  Court repeatedly  has recognized  that \"cutting\n\nprices in order to increase business often is the very essence of\n\ncompetition,\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at  594.

Plaintiffs  suggest  that  their\n                            \n\ninability to respond with particularity to defendants' motion for\n\nsummary  judgment is attributable to the district court's refusal\n\nto lift  a  stay  of  discovery that  had  been  imposed  on  the\n\nantitrust claims.   The decision whether to allow discovery while\n\na summary judgment motion is pending rests  within the discretion\n\nof the  district court, Sheinkopf  v. Stone, 927 F.2d  1259, 1263\n                                           \n\n(1st  Cir.  1991), and  \"the  party seeking  additional  time for\n\ndiscovery  .  . .  must  show  that the  facts  sought  `will, if\n\nobtained,  suffice  to   engender  an  issue  both   genuine  and\n\nmaterial,'\" id. (citation omitted).\n               \n\n     As  the  district  court  observed,  plaintiffs   were  well\n\nsituated to explore Welch's impact on competition in  the bottled\n\ngrape  juice market,  and they  had  an obligation  to use  their\n\nknowledge and connection with the market to develop some basis to\n\njustify   further  inquiry.10      Plaintiffs,  however,   \"never\n\n                    \n\n     10 For  example, plaintiffs could  have done  a sampling  of\nstores to  compare prices  and shelf life  between the  Welch and\nDonald Duck products.

Their failure  to do so negates  their claim\n\nthat the district court erred in denying discovery.\n\n     Accordingly,  we conclude that  the district  court properly\n\ndismissed  plaintiffs'  claims  under sections  1  and  2 of  the\n\nSherman Act, as well as  under the analogous provisions of Puerto\n\nRico law.\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n                                        \n\n     For  the foregoing reasons,  we vacate the  summary judgment\n\nfor defendants  on the Law  75 and tortious  interference claims,\n\nand remand those  issues for further proceedings  consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   We affirm dismissal of the antitrust  claims.  We\n\nhave not  considered in any  fashion defendants' argument  to the\n\ndistrict  court that  dismissal of  all  claims alternatively  is\n\nappropriate based on Fed. R. Civ. P.  41 and the court's inherent\n\npowers to control the proceedings  before it.

In 1987, Welch needed a new distributor for its frozen concentrate line of products, and, with the help of its local broker, Magna Trading, it identified R.W. as the most suitable--though not perfect--candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of Welch's interest in R.W., company executives had concerns about R.W.'s handling a competing line of juice products under the \"Donald Duck\" label.  Welch's international marketing manager initially had suggested internally that R.W. would have to drop the Donald Duck line \"to be a viable option,\" see App. at 213, but he later reported that R.W.'s owner, Thomas Ward, had agreed to undertake several measures to assure that the Welch frozen concentrates would receive full support despite the continued presence of the Donald Duck products.  These included \"[a] trial period with no commitment by Welch's for a larger period of representation,\" App. at 219, and a financial contribution from R.W. for advertising Welch's product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discussion among the parties took place through the early months of 1988 and, on March 25, Welch's international marketing manager wrote to Ward to announce his company's decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

It was not until three months later, however, in late June, that Welch submitted a proposed contract to plaintiffs.  Ward responded in August with a counterproposal.  Of particular concern to the Puerto Rico company were provisions in the agreement that appeared to reflect an effort by Welch to bypass Act 75, which subjects companies to substantial damages if they terminate dealership contracts for other than \"just cause.\"   The Welch document, for example, characterized the relationship with R.W. as a transfer of the contractual arrangement that had existed between Welch and its prior distributors before the passage of Act 75.  Welch's draft also specified that New York law would govern the agreement.  R.W.'s revised draft, inter alia, deleted the \"transfer\" language and specified that Puerto Rico law would apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October, after a series of telephone conversations between attorneys, Welch submitted a third proposed draft of the agreement, which reinstated all of the language that had been of primary concern to R.W.  During a visit to Puerto Rico in early December and in subsequent correspondence, Welch's international marketing manager encouraged Ward to complete the contract negotiations \"as soon as possible.\"   On January 30, 1989, Ward responded by letter stating that he, too, was anxious to finalize the agreement, but that there were a few items \"that your lawyer insists on and that we feel are not in the best interest of our future relationship.\"   In response to an inquiry about R.W.'s investing $50,000 in a promotional campaign, Ward noted that the commitment was not yet ripe because he had agreed to make this expenditure \"once we as a company[ ] held a working agreement with Welch's.\"   A follow-up letter sent by Ward on February 8 to the president of Magna Trading reiterated concerns about the \"transfer\" concept as a means of \"avoid[ing] Law 75 constraints.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the applicability of Law 75 remained the only significant point of contractual disagreement between the parties.  They had resolved earlier conflicts as to which of Ward's entities would be named specifically in the contract (only R.W.), and whether R.W. would have an exclusive distributorship during the one-year trial period (no).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The companies had been continuing to do business throughout the negotiation period.  Late in 1988, the relationship appeared to be working well;  Magna Trading's president, Roberto Giro, wrote to Ward in early December to commend him for exceeding by 11 percent the goal on a special product promotion.  Early in 1989, however, Giro began to express concern about R.W.'s side-by-side handling of the Welch and Donald Duck products.  On January 20, he wrote to Welch's marketing manager indicating discomfort with Ward's involvement in a new line of Donald Duck grape juice products.  This concern escalated, and Giro wrote again on March 22 suggesting that R.W. was not giving priority to Welch products as it had promised to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 1989, Welch's international vice president, William Hewins, informed Ward in a letter of Welch's decision \"to discontinue the existing pre-trial relationship ... and, therefore, putting an end to the one-year trial or probationary relationship for our frozen concentrate products.\"   The letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>As you know, the idea of working together on a one-year trial basis was, as per your recommendations, to determine if Welch's frozen concentrates could be handled to our satisfaction in spite of your handling a competitive product.  The pre-trial relationship proved to us that the conflicts of interest of your representing both competing lines are significant and irreconcilable....  An increased level of conflict in personal relations between our broker and R.W. International has also been noted, tracing to conflicts between the brands represented by the two firms....  Instead of complementing one another, as was your original premise, these brands represent conflicting interests for you and us....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Welch terminated the relationship before the parties reached an agreement in writing, the one-year trial period envisioned at the outset of their dealings never even commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed this action in April 1989.  Their amended complaint alleges that Welch terminated their dealership agreement without just cause in violation of Law 75;  that Magna Trading tortiously interfered with their contractual relationship with Welch;  and that defendants violated antitrust laws by threatening, and then later actually terminating, plaintiffs' dealership if R.W. did not agree to drop Donald Duck products, and by seeking to monopolize the bottled grape juice market through a price-cutting war.  The case was dismissed once on improper procedural grounds, see R.W. International Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., 937 F.2d 11 (1st Cir.1991), and, following remand, dismissed again on defendants' motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, plaintiffs maintain that all of their claims are viable.  They argue that, contrary to the district court's ruling, precedent on Law 75 establishes that the statute does govern the business relationship within which R.W. and Welch operated for a year.  They assert that this arrangement also provides a basis for their tortious interference claim against Magna.  In addition, plaintiffs argue that their antitrust allegations were sufficient to withstand defendants' summary judgment motion and that, if their showing were deficient, the court erred in dismissing the claims without first allowing discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Applicability of Law 75</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 75 provides that, notwithstanding any contractual provision to the contrary, the supplier in a distribution contract may terminate a dealership only for \"just cause.\"   P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278a.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The statute was intended to protect Puerto Rico dealers from the harm caused when a supplier arbitrarily terminates a distributorship once the dealer has created a favorable market for the supplier's products, \"thus frustrating the legitimate expectations and interests of those who so efficiently carried out their responsibilities,\" Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., 858 F.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir.1988) (reproducing in full translation of Puerto Rico Supreme Court's response to certified question, 122 P.R.Dec. 172 (1988) (citing legislative reports)).  The Act has been described as \"very much a 'one-way street' designed to protect dealers from the unwarranted acts of termination by suppliers,\" Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc., 689 F.Supp. 1235, 1237 (D.P.R.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of its summary judgment motion, Welch did not dispute that R.W. and its affiliates were performing the functions of a distributor within the meaning of Law 75 during the twelve months the parties were doing business, see P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Welch's position was, and is, that these operations occurred during a kind of \"twilight zone\" period while the parties attempted to negotiate in good faith the terms that would govern their actual relationship.  Because the negotiations failed, the relationship never materialized, and so, in Welch's view, Law 75 never was implicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted this argument, concluding that Law 75 was not meant to apply to a period of preliminary negotiations preceding a completed working agreement between a supplier and distributor.  The court noted that keeping operations in abeyance during a good-faith negotiating process \"would allow distributors to sit and wait while the principal loses its market--obtaining, literally without any effort, a stronger bargaining position every day it waits.\"   Applying Law 75 to dealings during that period, however, \"would curtail the autonomy required for arms-length negotiations.\"   Neither approach would serve the statute's purpose of \"improving and permitting a system of free competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' challenge to this judgment is straightforward.  Law 75 makes no distinctions among distributorship arrangements, they assert, be they described as pre-trial, preliminary, temporary or tentative.  The only relevant point of inquiry is whether R.W. and its affiliates were performing as a dealer under the statute;  if so, Law 75 governs.  R.W. thus contends that, because Welch concedes dealer status, its decision to terminate the relationship must be judged under the statute's \"just cause\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that plaintiffs' position is the correct one.  Their most compelling support is provided by the statutory language, which defines a \"dealer's contract\" subject to Law 75 as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>[a] relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278(b) (emphasis added).  The statute clearly incorporates within its reach any arrangement between a supplier and dealer in which the dealer is actually in the process of distributing the supplier's merchandise in Puerto Rico.  The statute does not apply to suppliers' simple sales to Puerto Rican wholesalers.  It insists upon establishment of a \"supplier/dealer\" relationship.  But once that relationship is established, the statute applies irrespective of the length of time such an arrangement has been in existence, and it explicitly rejects any efforts by the parties to foreclose coverage through semantic niceties.  Welch's concession that R.W. was acting as a dealer (for purposes of summary judgment) thus seems dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch, however, asserts that the statute is not meant to be as inclusive as its language suggests, and it offers several reasons to support this position.  In our view, each falters upon close scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Welch claims that the word \"established\" in the provision indicates that Law 75 applies only once the parties have achieved a certain level of stability.  The parties in this case may have been working with each other, Welch observes, but their failure to reach agreement on essential terms meant that their relationship was never \"established\" within the meaning of Law 75.  In support of this argument, Welch cites language from cases describing the Law 75 relationship as \"characterized by its continuity, stability, mutual trust, coordination between both parties as independent entrepreneurs,\" J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kayser Jeep Int'l Corp., 108 P.R.Dec. 134, 145 (1978) (Official Translation);  see also Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford Industries, Inc., 122 P.R.Dec. 117 (1988), Official Translation of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, slip op. at 5 (June 30, 1988);  Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 822.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree that a relationship is \"established\" within the meaning of Law 75 only after a supplier and dealer have reached the point at which their relationship might be described as \"stable\" or \"continuous.\"   Although the statute was enacted to protect from abrupt and arbitrary termination dealers whose longstanding representation had provided substantial economic benefit to the manufacturer, the law is drafted to govern relationships from their inception to ensure that they will both become and remain stable and continuous.   See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 820 (Act 75 levels bargaining power between manufacturer and dealer \"[i]n order to achieve reasonably stable dealership relationships in Puerto Rico\").  Although the precedent cited by Welch describes the type of longstanding commercial partnership that gave rise to Law 75, we do not read the cases to exclude fledgling relationships from the act's coverage.  A well-established dealer may have more to lose--and may have provided more benefit to the supplier--than a dealer with less tenure, but the statute makes no distinction between them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can it be said that a relationship is established within the meaning of Law 75 only if it is committed to writing.  Indeed, Welch's counsel acknowledged at oral argument that a relationship subject to the statute may be established through a course of dealing, but argued that this was not such a case because the parties continued to disagree over the essential terms of their affiliation throughout their entire collaboration.  In other words, Welch contends that this relationship was not established because its terms still were being negotiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that the parties had yet to agree on the dimensions of their future relationship, the fact remains that they were operating as business partners under some terms for a full year.  Plaintiffs sent purchase orders to Welch approximately once a week between March 1988 and March 1989, and Ward's companies were actively involved in distributing Welch products throughout that time.  As noted above, Ward received a commendation from Magna Trading's president for its effort in a successful special promotion.  To be sure, the relationship envisioned by the parties when they began to do business never materialized;  the relationship protected by Law 75, however, was the one that actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch's second argument, that applying Law 75 during a period of preliminary negotiations improperly burdens the parties' liberty to contract, is the one the district court found particularly convincing.  When parties freely have agreed that a trial period will precede establishment of the long-term relationship Law 75 is intended to protect, the company asserts, invoking the Act before conclusion of the trial period is tantamount to coercing the parties into a contract neither agreed to enter.  This is particularly harmful to the supplier, Welch maintains, because Law 75 is designed to empower dealers.  Thus, a supplier who is not allowed to step away from an unsuccessful attempted relationship would be forced into accepting the dealer's terms and conditions, with the consequent loss of its financial and legal autonomy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect several problems with this argument.  In the first place, as we have noted, the parties in this case were not simply negotiating a relationship to be activated sometime in the future.  R.W. had been serving as Welch's Puerto Rico dealer for twelve months.  While we would have no difficulty in accepting that a supplier could break off negotiations, no matter how long they had been going on, the issue before us is whether Welch can terminate an actual dealership relationship that existed contemporaneously with the negotiations.  Welch wants to insulate those dealings from Law 75 because they were part of a longer-term plan.  The statute, however, plainly states that the characterization of a relationship (e.g., calling it temporary or preliminary) does not affect its status under Law 75.  If the parties are dealing, a dealership exists for purposes of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This bright line makes sense.  Otherwise, suppliers could insist on various types of contingency arrangements to avoid Law 75's restrictions for substantial periods of time.  Although Welch's concerns about R.W.'s capacity to perform in the face of a potential conflict of interest seem legitimate, delaying Law 75's coverage until long after the dealership relationship began would allow Welch to terminate for any reason whatsoever.  Welch, for example, could forsake R.W. without recourse and without regard for any efforts taken by R.W. to gear up for Welch's business, if another dealer willing to accept a smaller commission suddenly became available.  Moreover, there seems to be no principled distinction between Welch's one-year trial period and a supplier's effort to designate a three- or even five-year \"preliminary\" distributorship before deciding on a long-term relationship.  To rule that a contingent relationship is outside the scope of Law 75 is thus to allow a significant loophole in the protection the Puerto Rico legislature sought to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, we fail to see how applying Law 75 in the circumstances of this case necessarily would require Welch to continue a relationship it does not want in a manner to which it has serious objections.  Law 75 simply requires a supplier to justify its decision to terminate a dealership.  If Welch's conflict-of-interest concerns about R.W. are legitimate, we have no doubt that this would constitute \"just cause\" under Law 75.  See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 823-24.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, applying Law 75 here does not force a contract onto unwilling parties;  it simply imposes conditions on an existing relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the liberty of contract argument stumbles insofar as it presumes that only the supplier will suffer if, to avoid application of Law 75, the parties refrain from dealing until they have reached final agreement on all terms to govern their long-term relationship.  The manufacturer and the dealer share an interest in maximizing sales of the product, and it would be no more to the dealer's advantage than to the manufacturer's for a market to slip away while the parties are engaged in protracted negotiations.  We therefore disagree with the district court's view that dealers will gain unfair advantage in bargaining if Law 75 is triggered as soon as the parties start dealing.  Both sides have an incentive to reach agreement at the earliest possible time.  To the extent a supplier's future flexibility is diminished by its choice to begin dealing before all issues have been resolved, this is a result intended by the legislators who enacted Law 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the practical effect of activating the Dealers' Act as soon as the parties start conducting business as supplier and dealer is to ensure that, right from the start, the relationship is marked by a certain level of commitment from the supplier.  This does not entirely deprive suppliers of the opportunity to evaluate the suitability of a particular match through a \"test period.\"   It simply means that the relationship can be severed without consequence only for just cause, i.e., if the dealer fails a meaningful test.  This should not trouble suppliers engaged in good-faith negotiations, for their goal is to produce a long-term working agreement.  If, on the other hand, a preliminary \"understanding\" disintegrates into impasse over essential terms, a finding of \"just cause\" seems likely.  Law 75 is not intended to extend unworkable relationships, but only to prevent arbitrary terminations.  See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 823-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, whether or not statutes of this kind are sound policy is not our concern.  Perhaps a case can be made for having a fixed period during which the relationship is probationary and the statutory rights under Law 75 do not vest;  this is typical for tenure arrangements in government employment and in the academic world.  But the legislature has not enacted such a window, as we read the present statute, and it is not for us to amend the statute in the guise of construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch's effort to bolster its position through reliance on Medina &amp; Medina and another case involving a novel Law 75 question, Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc., 689 F.Supp. 1235 (D.P.R.1988), is unavailing.  In Medina &amp; Medina, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that a supplier may withdraw from the Puerto Rico market without consequence under Law 75 if \"the parties have bargained in good faith but have not been able to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership,\" 858 F.2d at 824.   Welch contends that the district court's ruling, allowing the company to call off the protracted, unsuccessful negotiations with R.W., is faithful to that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Medina &amp; Medina, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not rule that a temporary relationship pending completion of negotiations is outside the scope of Law 75, but it held that the failed negotiations over price and credit terms provided just cause for the supplier's decision to terminate the distributorship a year after it began.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Until that case, it was unclear whether a supplier could terminate without consequence for any reason other than the dealer's adverse actions.  Medina &amp; Medina does help Welch, in that it allows an argument that failed negotiations may support a finding of \"just cause,\" but it does not bolster the company's argument that preliminary dealings fall outside Law 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nike, a federal district court permitted termination of a dealer who failed to give the contractually required written notice to the supplier of its intent to renew the contract.  689 F.Supp. at 1239.   According to Welch, Nike stands for the principle that dealers may not avoid the express terms of agreements to which they willingly subscribe.  Consequently, the company argues, the district court properly held appellants to their own characterization of the arrangement as a preliminary test period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument stretches Nike far beyond its legitimate boundaries.  Nike addressed only whether Law 75 released a dealer from an explicit renewal procedure contained in the distributorship contract.  Noting that the statute's purpose was to protect against unjustified termination by the principal, the court ruled that it had no effect on mutual agreements specifying the manner in which a dealer must notify a supplier of its desire to continue their relationship.  See 689 F.Supp. at 1239.   In other words, while Law 75 takes away from the supplier the right to make a subjective decision to terminate, other than for \"just cause,\" the parties may agree to a contractual procedure that gives the dealer the power either to end or to continue the relationship after a given period of time.  Nike holds that Law 75 does not protect the dealer from its own failure to follow that procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is simply not equivalent to Nike.   Welch, in essence, claims that the parties agreed that Welch would have the power to terminate their relationship after a preliminary test period, without regard to just cause.  This, however, is precisely the imbalance of power to which Law 75 was directed, and the statute invalidates such an agreement.  Under Law 75, a principal may not wield unilateral authority to terminate a dealership relationship for other than just cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no basis upon which to exclude the ongoing commercial dealings between Welch and R.W. from the embrace of Law 75.  The district court's grant of summary judgment therefore must be reversed so that the court may consider whether Welch had \"just cause\" for terminating the relationship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because summary judgment on the claim for tortious interference with a contractual relation was premised on the Law 75 holding, that decision also must be vacated and remanded for further consideration.  The remand on the tortious interference claim is without prejudice to any argument Welch may be making that, regardless of the existence of a relationship protected by Law 75, there was no contract protected against tortious interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Antitrust Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1989, R.W. introduced a new Donald Duck bottled grape juice into the market with an intensive promotional campaign.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants' reaction to the new product, and R.W.'s representation of it, violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1, 2, as well as Commonwealth antitrust law, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Secs. 258, 260.  The principal actions cited by plaintiffs in their amended complaint were (1) discussions in which Welch and Magna expressed \"anger ('molestia'), discomfort and preoccupation with Plaintiffs' handling of the 'Donald Duck' bottled grape juice,\" Amended Complaint at p 78;  (2) a \"massive promotional campaign\" for Welch's own bottled grape juice, and a price cutting war, \"in order to block out the entrance [of] the 'Donald Duck' bottled grape juice into the Puerto Rican market,\" id. at pp 82, 91;  and (3) the decision of Welch to terminate its relationship with plaintiffs because R.W. did not drop representation of the Donald Duck juice, id. at p 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on these claims, concluding that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants' actions constituted either a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of Sec. 1 of the Sherman Act,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> or an unlawful conspiracy to monopolize the bottled grape juice market in violation of Sec. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Of greatest significance to the court was a declaration from one of Magna's principals, Francisco Gil, stating that Donald Duck bottled products had reached, within a short period of time, at least 80 percent of the stores typically carrying such products.  The court found that summary judgment was proper because \"plaintiffs never responded to Welch's claim that [ ] competition has not been injured, and that the Donald Duck bottled grape juice was successfully introduced into the Puerto Rico market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim on appeal that the court improperly and prematurely dismissed their antitrust claims.  Much of their brief on this issue, however, is devoted to an off-the-mark argument concerning the court's failure to treat the allegations in their complaint liberally.  The court did not dismiss the antitrust claims based on the pleadings, but ruled that plaintiffs had failed to substantiate in any way their conclusory allegations in response to defendants' summary judgment motion and accompanying declaration.  Our review of the district court's decision consequently focuses solely on the appropriateness of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act.   As argued by plaintiffs in their appellate brief, the unreasonable restraint of trade underlying their Sec. 1 claim was an alleged threat by Welch (as part of a conspiracy with Magna ) to terminate plaintiffs' dealership and the subsequent actual termination of the relationship.  These actions presumably were alleged to violate the antitrust laws based on their impact in pressuring plaintiffs to drop the Donald Duck line of products, thereby suppressing competition among grape juice manufacturers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Heavy-handed competitive tactics alone do not constitute an antitrust violation, however.  To survive defendants' motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs needed to demonstrate a genuine dispute as to whether defendants' actions caused an injury to competition, as distinguished from impact on themselves.  See, e.g., Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 884, 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 247 (1993) (\"The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.\");  Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 767 n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 2739 n. 14, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984) (\" '[T]he antitrust laws ... were enacted for \"the protection of competition, not competitors.\" ' \")  (citations omitted) (emphasis in original);  Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst., 851 F.2d 478, 486 (1st Cir.1988) (\" 'Anticompetitive' ... refers not to actions that merely injure individual competitors, but rather to actions that harm the competitive process.\").  Once defendants presented a declaration averring that the Donald Duck products successfully entered the market during the relevant period of time--indicating a lack of injury to competition--plaintiffs were obliged to counter that statement with more than the bare allegations contained in their complaint.  See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 584-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1354-56, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs responded with a statement from R.W. owner Ward, which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>2.

Upon information and believe [sic], this intensive promotion was carried out in conjunction with Magna Trading Corporation to eliminate the Donald Duck bottled grape juice from [the] Puerto Rico market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that this statement was insufficient to generate a genuine factual dispute because it left unchallenged defendants' assertion that the Donald Duck bottled juice had deeply penetrated the Puerto Rico market during the period of defendants' allegedly unlawful conspiracy.  The court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>[A]s the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has recognized, distributors are in contact with the retailers, consumers, and the different components of the trade.  Medina, 817  F.2d at 823 n. 6.   Plaintiffs were in the position to show, based on their knowledge of the Puerto Rico market, the effects of Welch's conduct on the market....  However, other than the conclusory allegation that their line had been \"severely suppressed,\" plaintiffs never responded to Welch's claim that the competition has not been injured, and that the Donald Duck bottled grape juice was successfully introduced into the Puerto Rico market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision and explanation are unimpeachable.  Plaintiffs may have felt pressured to drop the Donald Duck products in order to preserve the Welch dealership, and may have suffered economic consequences from Welch's decision to terminate, but these circumstances are irrelevant insofar as an antitrust violation is concerned.  Plaintiffs' failure to rebut defendants' assertion that Donald Duck bottled grape juice had no problem entering the market--an implicit assertion that competition was not affected--fully justifies the district court's decision to grant summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs take issue with the significance of defendants' penetration figure, arguing that each of the stores carrying Donald Duck juice may have had only a single bottle of that brand while displaying shelves full of Welch products.  We agree with the district court, however, that such information, if true, could have been obtained easily by plaintiffs, and its absence is thus not a proper basis upon which to withhold summary judgment from defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See infra at 488 (denial of discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2 of the Sherman Act.   Plaintiffs' Sec. 2 claim characterizes defendants' promotional campaign, in which Welch reduced prices on its bottled grape juice, as an impermissible effort to gain monopoly control of the bottled grape juice market in Puerto Rico.  In light of R.W.'s success in introducing the Donald Duck juice, this claim is wholly without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court repeatedly has recognized that \"cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition,\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594, 106 S.Ct. at 1360.

There was little basis for believing that Welch was engaged in below-cost pricing as opposed to mere price reduction, although even below-cost pricing is not automatically an antitrust violation if competition is not threatened.   See Brook Group, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2588.   Where, in addition, a new product is able to deeply penetrate the market during the challenged price-cutting period, it is evident that competition is unharmed and \"summary disposition of the case is appropriate,\" id.  --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2589.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Request for Discovery.   Plaintiffs suggest that their inability to respond with particularity to defendants' motion for summary judgment is attributable to the district court's refusal to lift a stay of discovery that had been imposed on the antitrust claims.  The decision whether to allow discovery while a summary judgment motion is pending rests within the discretion of the district court, Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1263 (1st Cir.1991), and \"the party seeking additional time for discovery ... must show that the facts sought 'will, if obtained, suffice to engender an issue both genuine and material,' \" id.

Nevertheless, we believe the principle underlying Medina &amp; Medina is equally applicable in these circumstances, i.e., that a supplier has just cause to terminate if it has bargained in good faith but has not been able \"to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership,\" 858 F.2d at 824.

See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 776, 104 S.Ct. at 2744 (holding that \"the coordinated behavior of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary falls outside the reach of [Sec. 1]\");  Pink Supply Corp. v.

Plaintiffs claimed that the dissolution of the relationship violated the Puerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278 (Law 75), and federal and state antitrust laws.

In 1987, Welch needed a new distributor for its frozen concentrate line of products, and, with the help of its local broker, Magna Trading, it identified R.W. as the most suitable--though not perfect--candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of Welch's interest in R.W., company executives had concerns about R.W.'s handling a competing line of juice products under the \"Donald Duck\" label.  Welch's international marketing manager initially had suggested internally that R.W. would have to drop the Donald Duck line \"to be a viable option,\" see App. at 213, but he later reported that R.W.'s owner, Thomas Ward, had agreed to undertake several measures to assure that the Welch frozen concentrates would receive full support despite the continued presence of the Donald Duck products.  These included \"[a] trial period with no commitment by Welch's for a larger period of representation,\" App. at 219, and a financial contribution from R.W. for advertising Welch's product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discussion among the parties took place through the early months of 1988 and, on March 25, Welch's international marketing manager wrote to Ward to announce his company's decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

International and its distributing affiliate T.H. Ward de la Cruz Inc. as its distributors in Puerto Rico for Welch's frozen product line.  This change will go into effect as of this date and a written agreement is expected to be arrived at in the near future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 366 (translation in appendix to appellant's brief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties immediately began doing business, with plaintiffs regularly submitting purchase orders and defendants delivering the merchandise and billing plaintiffs.  It was not until three months later, however, in late June, that Welch submitted a proposed contract to plaintiffs.  Ward responded in August with a counterproposal.  Of particular concern to the Puerto Rico company were provisions in the agreement that appeared to reflect an effort by Welch to bypass Act 75, which subjects companies to substantial damages if they terminate dealership contracts for other than \"just cause.\"   The Welch document, for example, characterized the relationship with R.W. as a transfer of the contractual arrangement that had existed between Welch and its prior distributors before the passage of Act 75.  Welch's draft also specified that New York law would govern the agreement.  R.W.'s revised draft, inter alia, deleted the \"transfer\" language and specified that Puerto Rico law would apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October, after a series of telephone conversations between attorneys, Welch submitted a third proposed draft of the agreement, which reinstated all of the language that had been of primary concern to R.W.  During a visit to Puerto Rico in early December and in subsequent correspondence, Welch's international marketing manager encouraged Ward to complete the contract negotiations \"as soon as possible.\"   On January 30, 1989, Ward responded by letter stating that he, too, was anxious to finalize the agreement, but that there were a few items \"that your lawyer insists on and that we feel are not in the best interest of our future relationship.\"   In response to an inquiry about R.W.'s investing $50,000 in a promotional campaign, Ward noted that the commitment was not yet ripe because he had agreed to make this expenditure \"once we as a company[ ] held a working agreement with Welch's.\"   A follow-up letter sent by Ward on February 8 to the president of Magna Trading reiterated concerns about the \"transfer\" concept as a means of \"avoid[ing] Law 75 constraints.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the applicability of Law 75 remained the only significant point of contractual disagreement between the parties.  They had resolved earlier conflicts as to which of Ward's entities would be named specifically in the contract (only R.W.), and whether R.W. would have an exclusive distributorship during the one-year trial period (no).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The companies had been continuing to do business throughout the negotiation period.  Late in 1988, the relationship appeared to be working well;  Magna Trading's president, Roberto Giro, wrote to Ward in early December to commend him for exceeding by 11 percent the goal on a special product promotion.  Early in 1989, however, Giro began to express concern about R.W.'s side-by-side handling of the Welch and Donald Duck products.  On January 20, he wrote to Welch's marketing manager indicating discomfort with Ward's involvement in a new line of Donald Duck grape juice products.  This concern escalated, and Giro wrote again on March 22 suggesting that R.W. was not giving priority to Welch products as it had promised to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 1989, Welch's international vice president, William Hewins, informed Ward in a letter of Welch's decision \"to discontinue the existing pre-trial relationship ... and, therefore, putting an end to the one-year trial or probationary relationship for our frozen concentrate products.\"   The letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>As you know, the idea of working together on a one-year trial basis was, as per your recommendations, to determine if Welch's frozen concentrates could be handled to our satisfaction in spite of your handling a competitive product.  The pre-trial relationship proved to us that the conflicts of interest of your representing both competing lines are significant and irreconcilable....  An increased level of conflict in personal relations between our broker and R.W. International has also been noted, tracing to conflicts between the brands represented by the two firms....  Instead of complementing one another, as was your original premise, these brands represent conflicting interests for you and us....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Welch terminated the relationship before the parties reached an agreement in writing, the one-year trial period envisioned at the outset of their dealings never even commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed this action in April 1989.  Their amended complaint alleges that Welch terminated their dealership agreement without just cause in violation of Law 75;  that Magna Trading tortiously interfered with their contractual relationship with Welch;  and that defendants violated antitrust laws by threatening, and then later actually terminating, plaintiffs' dealership if R.W. did not agree to drop Donald Duck products, and by seeking to monopolize the bottled grape juice market through a price-cutting war.  The case was dismissed once on improper procedural grounds, see R.W. International Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563789\"><a href=\"/opinion/563789/rw-international-corp-and-t-h-ward-de-la-cruz-inc-v-welch-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991), and, following remand, dismissed again on defendants' motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, plaintiffs maintain that all of their claims are viable.  They argue that, contrary to the district court's ruling, precedent on Law 75 establishes that the statute does govern the business relationship within which R.W. and Welch operated for a year.  They assert that this arrangement also provides a basis for their tortious interference claim against Magna.  In addition, plaintiffs argue that their antitrust allegations were sufficient to withstand defendants' summary judgment motion and that, if their showing were deficient, the court erred in dismissing the claims without first allowing discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span>, 1237 (D.P.R.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of its summary judgment motion, Welch did not dispute that R.W. and its affiliates were performing the functions of a distributor within the meaning of Law 75 during the twelve months the parties were doing business, see P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Welch's position was, and is, that these operations occurred during a kind of \"twilight zone\" period while the parties attempted to negotiate in good faith the terms that would govern their actual relationship.  Because the negotiations failed, the relationship never materialized, and so, in Welch's view, Law 75 never was implicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted this argument, concluding that Law 75 was not meant to apply to a period of preliminary negotiations preceding a completed working agreement between a supplier and distributor.  The court noted that keeping operations in abeyance during a good-faith negotiating process \"would allow distributors to sit and wait while the principal loses its market--obtaining, literally without any effort, a stronger bargaining position every day it waits.\"   Applying Law 75 to dealings during that period, however, \"would curtail the autonomy required for arms-length negotiations.\"   Neither approach would serve the statute's purpose of \"improving and permitting a system of free competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' challenge to this judgment is straightforward.  Law 75 makes no distinctions among distributorship arrangements, they assert, be they described as pre-trial, preliminary, temporary or tentative.  The only relevant point of inquiry is whether R.W. and its affiliates were performing as a dealer under the statute;  if so, Law 75 governs.  R.W. thus contends that, because Welch concedes dealer status, its decision to terminate the relationship must be judged under the statute's \"just cause\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that plaintiffs' position is the correct one.  Their most compelling support is provided by the statutory language, which defines a \"dealer's contract\" subject to Law 75 as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>[a] relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call, characterize or execute such relationship, the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or of the rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the market of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Sec. 278(b) (emphasis added).  The statute clearly incorporates within its reach any arrangement between a supplier and dealer in which the dealer is actually in the process of distributing the supplier's merchandise in Puerto Rico.  The statute does not apply to suppliers' simple sales to Puerto Rican wholesalers.  It insists upon establishment of a \"supplier/dealer\" relationship.  But once that relationship is established, the statute applies irrespective of the length of time such an arrangement has been in existence, and it explicitly rejects any efforts by the parties to foreclose coverage through semantic niceties.  Welch's concession that R.W. was acting as a dealer (for purposes of summary judgment) thus seems dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch, however, asserts that the statute is not meant to be as inclusive as its language suggests, and it offers several reasons to support this position.  In our view, each falters upon close scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Welch claims that the word \"established\" in the provision indicates that Law 75 applies only once the parties have achieved a certain level of stability.  The parties in this case may have been working with each other, Welch observes, but their failure to reach agreement on essential terms meant that their relationship was never \"established\" within the meaning of Law 75.  In support of this argument, Welch cites language from cases describing the Law 75 relationship as \"characterized by its continuity, stability, mutual trust, coordination between both parties as independent entrepreneurs,\" J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kayser Jeep Int'l Corp., 108 P.R.Dec. 134, 145 (1978) (Official Translation);  see also Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford Industries, Inc., 122 P.R.Dec. 117 (1988), Official Translation of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, slip op. at 5 (June 30, 1988);  Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 822.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree that a relationship is \"established\" within the meaning of Law 75 only after a supplier and dealer have reached the point at which their relationship might be described as \"stable\" or \"continuous.\"   Although the statute was enacted to protect from abrupt and arbitrary termination dealers whose longstanding representation had provided substantial economic benefit to the manufacturer, the law is drafted to govern relationships from their inception to ensure that they will both become and remain stable and continuous.   See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 820 (Act 75 levels bargaining power between manufacturer and dealer \"[i]n order to achieve reasonably stable dealership relationships in Puerto Rico\").  Although the precedent cited by Welch describes the type of longstanding commercial partnership that gave rise to Law 75, we do not read the cases to exclude fledgling relationships from the act's coverage.  A well-established dealer may have more to lose--and may have provided more benefit to the supplier--than a dealer with less tenure, but the statute makes no distinction between them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can it be said that a relationship is established within the meaning of Law 75 only if it is committed to writing.  Indeed, Welch's counsel acknowledged at oral argument that a relationship subject to the statute may be established through a course of dealing, but argued that this was not such a case because the parties continued to disagree over the essential terms of their affiliation throughout their entire collaboration.  In other words, Welch contends that this relationship was not established because its terms still were being negotiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that the parties had yet to agree on the dimensions of their future relationship, the fact remains that they were operating as business partners under some terms for a full year.  Plaintiffs sent purchase orders to Welch approximately once a week between March 1988 and March 1989, and Ward's companies were actively involved in distributing Welch products throughout that time.  As noted above, Ward received a commendation from Magna Trading's president for its effort in a successful special promotion.  To be sure, the relationship envisioned by the parties when they began to do business never materialized;  the relationship protected by Law 75, however, was the one that actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch's second argument, that applying Law 75 during a period of preliminary negotiations improperly burdens the parties' liberty to contract, is the one the district court found particularly convincing.  When parties freely have agreed that a trial period will precede establishment of the long-term relationship Law 75 is intended to protect, the company asserts, invoking the Act before conclusion of the trial period is tantamount to coercing the parties into a contract neither agreed to enter.  This is particularly harmful to the supplier, Welch maintains, because Law 75 is designed to empower dealers.  Thus, a supplier who is not allowed to step away from an unsuccessful attempted relationship would be forced into accepting the dealer's terms and conditions, with the consequent loss of its financial and legal autonomy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect several problems with this argument.  In the first place, as we have noted, the parties in this case were not simply negotiating a relationship to be activated sometime in the future.  R.W. had been serving as Welch's Puerto Rico dealer for twelve months.  While we would have no difficulty in accepting that a supplier could break off negotiations, no matter how long they had been going on, the issue before us is whether Welch can terminate an actual dealership relationship that existed contemporaneously with the negotiations.  Welch wants to insulate those dealings from Law 75 because they were part of a longer-term plan.  The statute, however, plainly states that the characterization of a relationship (e.g., calling it temporary or preliminary) does not affect its status under Law 75.  If the parties are dealing, a dealership exists for purposes of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This bright line makes sense.  Otherwise, suppliers could insist on various types of contingency arrangements to avoid Law 75's restrictions for substantial periods of time.  Although Welch's concerns about R.W.'s capacity to perform in the face of a potential conflict of interest seem legitimate, delaying Law 75's coverage until long after the dealership relationship began would allow Welch to terminate for any reason whatsoever.  Welch, for example, could forsake R.W. without recourse and without regard for any efforts taken by R.W. to gear up for Welch's business, if another dealer willing to accept a smaller commission suddenly became available.  Moreover, there seems to be no principled distinction between Welch's one-year trial period and a supplier's effort to designate a three- or even five-year \"preliminary\" distributorship before deciding on a long-term relationship.  To rule that a contingent relationship is outside the scope of Law 75 is thus to allow a significant loophole in the protection the Puerto Rico legislature sought to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, we fail to see how applying Law 75 in the circumstances of this case necessarily would require Welch to continue a relationship it does not want in a manner to which it has serious objections.  Law 75 simply requires a supplier to justify its decision to terminate a dealership.  If Welch's conflict-of-interest concerns about R.W. are legitimate, we have no doubt that this would constitute \"just cause\" under Law 75.  See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 823-24.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, applying Law 75 here does not force a contract onto unwilling parties;  it simply imposes conditions on an existing relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the liberty of contract argument stumbles insofar as it presumes that only the supplier will suffer if, to avoid application of Law 75, the parties refrain from dealing until they have reached final agreement on all terms to govern their long-term relationship.  The manufacturer and the dealer share an interest in maximizing sales of the product, and it would be no more to the dealer's advantage than to the manufacturer's for a market to slip away while the parties are engaged in protracted negotiations.  We therefore disagree with the district court's view that dealers will gain unfair advantage in bargaining if Law 75 is triggered as soon as the parties start dealing.  Both sides have an incentive to reach agreement at the earliest possible time.  To the extent a supplier's future flexibility is diminished by its choice to begin dealing before all issues have been resolved, this is a result intended by the legislators who enacted Law 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the practical effect of activating the Dealers' Act as soon as the parties start conducting business as supplier and dealer is to ensure that, right from the start, the relationship is marked by a certain level of commitment from the supplier.  This does not entirely deprive suppliers of the opportunity to evaluate the suitability of a particular match through a \"test period.\"   It simply means that the relationship can be severed without consequence only for just cause, i.e., if the dealer fails a meaningful test.  This should not trouble suppliers engaged in good-faith negotiations, for their goal is to produce a long-term working agreement.  If, on the other hand, a preliminary \"understanding\" disintegrates into impasse over essential terms, a finding of \"just cause\" seems likely.  Law 75 is not intended to extend unworkable relationships, but only to prevent arbitrary terminations.  See Medina &amp; Medina, 858 F.2d at 823-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, whether or not statutes of this kind are sound policy is not our concern.  Perhaps a case can be made for having a fixed period during which the relationship is probationary and the statutory rights under Law 75 do not vest;  this is typical for tenure arrangements in government employment and in the academic world.  But the legislature has not enacted such a window, as we read the present statute, and it is not for us to amend the statute in the guise of construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch's effort to bolster its position through reliance on Medina &amp; Medina and another case involving a novel Law 75 question, Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890395\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890395/nike-intern-ltd-v-athletic-sales-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1988), is unavailing.  In Medina &amp; Medina, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court held that a supplier may withdraw from the Puerto Rico market without consequence under Law 75 if \"the parties have bargained in good faith but have not been able to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership,\" 858 F.2d at 824.   Welch contends that the district court's ruling, allowing the company to call off the protracted, unsuccessful negotiations with R.W., is faithful to that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Medina &amp; Medina, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not rule that a temporary relationship pending completion of negotiations is outside the scope of Law 75, but it held that the failed negotiations over price and credit terms provided just cause for the supplier's decision to terminate the distributorship a year after it began.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Until that case, it was unclear whether a supplier could terminate without consequence for any reason other than the dealer's adverse actions.  Medina &amp; Medina does help Welch, in that it allows an argument that failed negotiations may support a finding of \"just cause,\" but it does not bolster the company's argument that preliminary dealings fall outside Law 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nike, a federal district court permitted termination of a dealer who failed to give the contractually required written notice to the supplier of its intent to renew the contract.  689 F.Supp. at 1239.   According to Welch, Nike stands for the principle that dealers may not avoid the express terms of agreements to which they willingly subscribe.  Consequently, the company argues, the district court properly held appellants to their own characterization of the arrangement as a preliminary test period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument stretches Nike far beyond its legitimate boundaries.  Nike addressed only whether Law 75 released a dealer from an explicit renewal procedure contained in the distributorship contract.  Noting that the statute's purpose was to protect against unjustified termination by the principal, the court ruled that it had no effect on mutual agreements specifying the manner in which a dealer must notify a supplier of its desire to continue their relationship.  See 689 F.Supp. at 1239.   In other words, while Law 75 takes away from the supplier the right to make a subjective decision to terminate, other than for \"just cause,\" the parties may agree to a contractual procedure that gives the dealer the power either to end or to continue the relationship after a given period of time.  Nike holds that Law 75 does not protect the dealer from its own failure to follow that procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is simply not equivalent to Nike.   Welch, in essence, claims that the parties agreed that Welch would have the power to terminate their relationship after a preliminary test period, without regard to just cause.  This, however, is precisely the imbalance of power to which Law 75 was directed, and the statute invalidates such an agreement.  Under Law 75, a principal may not wield unilateral authority to terminate a dealership relationship for other than just cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no basis upon which to exclude the ongoing commercial dealings between Welch and R.W. from the embrace of Law 75.  The district court's grant of summary judgment therefore must be reversed so that the court may consider whether Welch had \"just cause\" for terminating the relationship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because summary judgment on the claim for tortious interference with a contractual relation was premised on the Law 75 holding, that decision also must be vacated and remanded for further consideration.  The remand on the tortious interference claim is without prejudice to any argument Welch may be making that, regardless of the existence of a relationship protected by Law 75, there was no contract protected against tortious interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Antitrust Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1989, R.W. introduced a new Donald Duck bottled grape juice into the market with an intensive promotional campaign.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants' reaction to the new product, and R.W.'s representation of it, violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1, 2, as well as Commonwealth antitrust law, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 10, Secs. 258, 260.  The principal actions cited by plaintiffs in their amended complaint were (1) discussions in which Welch and Magna expressed \"anger ('molestia'), discomfort and preoccupation with Plaintiffs' handling of the 'Donald Duck' bottled grape juice,\" Amended Complaint at p 78;  (2) a \"massive promotional campaign\" for Welch's own bottled grape juice, and a price cutting war, \"in order to block out the entrance [of] the 'Donald Duck' bottled grape juice into the Puerto Rican market,\" id. at pp 82, 91;  and (3) the decision of Welch to terminate its relationship with plaintiffs because R.W. did not drop representation of the Donald Duck juice, id. at p 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on these claims, concluding that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants' actions constituted either a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of Sec. 1 of the Sherman Act,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> or an unlawful conspiracy to monopolize the bottled grape juice market in violation of Sec. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Of greatest significance to the court was a declaration from one of Magna's principals, Francisco Gil, stating that Donald Duck bottled products had reached, within a short period of time, at least 80 percent of the stores typically carrying such products.  The court found that summary judgment was proper because \"plaintiffs never responded to Welch's claim that [ ] competition has not been injured, and that the Donald Duck bottled grape juice was successfully introduced into the Puerto Rico market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim on appeal that the court improperly and prematurely dismissed their antitrust claims.  Much of their brief on this issue, however, is devoted to an off-the-mark argument concerning the court's failure to treat the allegations in their complaint liberally.  The court did not dismiss the antitrust claims based on the pleadings, but ruled that plaintiffs had failed to substantiate in any way their conclusory allegations in response to defendants' summary judgment motion and accompanying declaration.  Our review of the district court's decision consequently focuses solely on the appropriateness of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act.   As argued by plaintiffs in their appellate brief, the unreasonable restraint of trade underlying their Sec. 1 claim was an alleged threat by Welch (as part of a conspiracy with Magna ) to terminate plaintiffs' dealership and the subsequent actual termination of the relationship.  These actions presumably were alleged to violate the antitrust laws based on their impact in pressuring plaintiffs to drop the Donald Duck line of products, thereby suppressing competition among grape juice manufacturers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Heavy-handed competitive tactics alone do not constitute an antitrust violation, however.  To survive defendants' motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs needed to demonstrate a genuine dispute as to whether defendants' actions caused an injury to competition, as distinguished from impact on themselves.

Plaintiffs may have felt pressured to drop the Donald Duck products in order to preserve the Welch dealership, and may have suffered economic consequences from Welch's decision to terminate, but these circumstances are irrelevant insofar as an antitrust violation is concerned.  Plaintiffs' failure to rebut defendants' assertion that Donald Duck bottled grape juice had no problem entering the market--an implicit assertion that competition was not affected--fully justifies the district court's decision to grant summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs take issue with the significance of defendants' penetration figure, arguing that each of the stores carrying Donald Duck juice may have had only a single bottle of that brand while displaying shelves full of Welch products.  We agree with the district court, however, that such information, if true, could have been obtained easily by plaintiffs, and its absence is thus not a proper basis upon which to withhold summary judgment from defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See infra at 488 (denial of discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2 of the Sherman Act.   Plaintiffs' Sec. 2 claim characterizes defendants' promotional campaign, in which Welch reduced prices on its bottled grape juice, as an impermissible effort to gain monopoly control of the bottled grape juice market in Puerto Rico.  In light of R.W.'s success in introducing the Donald Duck juice, this claim is wholly without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court repeatedly has recognized that \"cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition,\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594, 106 S.Ct. at 1360.

There was little basis for believing that Welch was engaged in below-cost pricing as opposed to mere price reduction, although even below-cost pricing is not automatically an antitrust violation if competition is not threatened.   See Brook Group, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2588.

Plaintiffs suggest that their inability to respond with particularity to defendants' motion for summary judgment is attributable to the district court's refusal to lift a stay of discovery that had been imposed on the antitrust claims.  The decision whether to allow discovery while a summary judgment motion is pending rests within the discretion of the district court, Sheinkopf v.

We affirm dismissal of the antitrust claims.  We have not considered in any fashion defendants' argument to the district court that dismissal of all claims alternatively is appropriate based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 41 and the court's inherent powers to control the proceedings before it.

There is no indication here that Welch intended to leave the market rather than find a new dealer.  Nevertheless, we believe the principle underlying Medina &amp; Medina is equally applicable in these circumstances, i.e., that a supplier has just cause to terminate if it has bargained in good faith but has not been able \"to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership,\" 858 F.2d at 824.   This would be true at least where, as here, the supplier's market in Puerto Rico was well established before the current dealer relationship and the supplier's action therefore \"is not aimed at reaping the good will or clientele established by the dealer,\" id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The dealership contract between Medina &amp; Medina and Country Pride contained no time limit.

The argument does seem to have some force, however.  See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 776, 104 S.Ct. at 2744 (holding that \"the coordinated behavior of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary falls outside the reach of [Sec. 1]\");  Pink Supply Corp. v.
