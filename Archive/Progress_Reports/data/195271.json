Defendant/appellant William L. Ferreira was\n               \n\nconvicted of  armed bank  robbery, see 18  U.S.C.    2113(d),\n                                      \n\nconspiracy to commit bank  robbery, see 18 U.S.C.    371, and\n                                       \n\nuse of a firearm during a crime of violence, see  18 U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n924(c).  Following an aborted appeal from his conviction, and\n\napproximately two years after  mandate issued, Ferreira filed\n\na motion  for new  trial, pursuant to  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  33,\n\nbased on  the  ground of  newly  discovered evidence.    This\n\nevidence  is a  sealed affidavit  of FBI Special  Agent James\n\nBurleigh,  which accompanied  the government's  opposition to\n\ndefendant's motion  to  quash a  grand  jury subpoena.    The\n\ndistrict  court denied  the motion  for new  trial, and  this\n\nappeal followed.  \n\n                          Background\n\n     The  following facts  are  undisputed.   On October  18,\n\n1988, the Bank  of New England on Rockdale Street, Braintree,\n\nMassachusetts  was  robbed.    Shortly  after  the   robbery,\n\nLieutenant Donald Murphy  of the Braintree  Police Department\n\nobserved four individuals descend  an embankment in the South\n\nShore Shopping Plaza,  speak briefly, and then depart  in two\n\nseparate cars.   Believing that  these four persons  were the\n\nrobbers, Lieutenant  Murphy followed one of the  two cars and\n\narrested its  occupants--John  Maguire and  Thomas  Kavanagh.\n\nThe  next day,  Lieutenant  Murphy was  shown a  photographic\n\narray,  and identified  Robert Hickey  as the  driver  of the\n\n                             -2-\n\nother car.     Approximately   six   weeks  later,   Ferreira\n\nreceived a  grand  jury  subpoena  to  appear  in  a  lineup.\n\nFerreira filed a motion to  quash the subpoena, claiming that\n\nthe subpoena  was \"nothing more than harassment  for his past\n\nactivities.\"1   The  government  filed an  opposition to  the\n\nmotion, supported by Special Agent Burleigh's affidavit.  The\n\naffidavit was filed in camera, ex parte, and was subsequently\n                             \n\nsealed  upon motion by  the government.2   The district court\n\ndenied  the motion to quash and ordered Ferreira to appear in\n\nthe line-up.\n\n     In a  lineup conducted on December  19, 1988, Lieutenant\n\nMurphy identified Ferreira  as the fourth robber.   That same\n\nday,  Ferreira was indicted by  the grand jury.   Evidence of\n\nLieutenant Murphy's identification of  Ferreira at the lineup\n\nwas later  introduced at trial.   Ferreira was  found guilty,\n\nand he appealed.   The  appeal was dismissed  on January  16,\n\n1991, upon Ferreira's motion for voluntary dismissal.  \n\n     On June 2, 1992, the government provided Ferreira with a\n\ncopy of Special Agent  Burleigh's sealed affidavit.  Ferreira\n\nthen filed  a motion  for new trial  contending, inter  alia,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n1.  In particular, Ferreira contended that the sole basis for\nthe  subpoena  was  his  previous criminal  record  for  bank\nrobbery and his  relationship with the  other suspects.   The\nother  suspects   were  acquaintances  from   Ferreira's  old\nneighborhood.   One  of the  suspects, Hickey,  is Ferreira's\nbrother-in-law, and  had been his co-defendant  in a previous\nbank robbery case.  \n\n2.  Ferriera unsuccessfully sought access to the affidavit.\n\n                             -3-\n\nthat the affidavit  contained two  misleading statements  and\n\nomitted  material information.   Ferreira further argued that\n\nif  the district court had  been made aware  of these alleged\n\nfalsehoods, the court would have granted the motion to quash,\n\nthe lineup would not have  occurred, and the government would\n\nnot have had enough evidence to make a case against him.  The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion for new trial on the grounds\n\nthat \"the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena was without\n\nbasis  and   should  have  been  denied   regardless  of  the\n\naffidavit.\"3  \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     It is well-established that a motion for new trial based\n\non newly discovered evidence will be denied unless the moving\n\nparty  can establish  each facet  of the  following four-part\n\ntest:\n\n     (1) the evidence was  unknown or unavailable to the\n     defendant at the time of  trial; (2) the failure to\n     learn  of it was  not a  result of  the defendant's\n     poor diligence;  (3) the new evidence  is material;\n     and (4) the impact of the new evidence is so strong\n     that  an  acquittal  would  probably   result  upon\n     retrial.  \n\n                    \n\n3.  Ferreira's remaining  arguments  in his  motion  for  new\ntrial, which we do not detail here, were not addressed by the\ndistrict  court.  None of these remaining claims are based on\nnewly discovered  evidence, and Ferreira does  not attempt to\nargue  otherwise.   Accordingly, these  claims are  barred by\nFed. R. Crim. P.  33's seven day time limit, and the district\ncourt  lacked  jurisdiction to  consider  them.   See  United\n                                                             \nStates  v. Lema, 909 F.2d  561, 565 (1st  Cir. 1990) (stating\n               \nthat Rule 33, which provides seven days in which a motion for\nnew  trial may  be filed,  unless  based on  newly discovered\nevidence, is jurisdictional).\n\n                             -4-\n\nUnited States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir.  1992).  We\n                      \n\nwill not disturb the disposition of a new trial motion unless\n\nthe district  court abused  its discretion or  misapplied the\n\nlaw.  United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318, 321  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1986).  We find no such error here.\n\n     The investigatory powers of the grand jury, although not\n\nunlimited, are necessarily  broad.  See  United States v.  R.\n                                                             \n\nEnters.,  Inc., 498 U.S.  292, 297  (1991) (stating  that the\n              \n\nfunction of the grand jury is to inquire into all information\n\nthat might possibly bear on its investigation); United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Dionisio, 410  U.S. 1,  15  (1973) (recognizing  that the\n            \n\ngrand jury's  investigatory powers include the  right to \"act\n\non tips, rumors, evidence offered by the prosecutor, or their\n\nown personal knowledge\").   We have explicitly recognized the\n\npower of the  grand jury to  direct witnesses to appear  in a\n\nlineup.   In  re  Melvin,  550  F.2d  674  (1st  Cir.  1977).\n                        \n\nAlthough  a judge, acting pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c),\n\nhas  the power  to quash  a subpoena  if compliance  would be\n\nunreasonable  or oppressive,  \"a grand  jury  subpoena issued\n\nthrough normal channels is presumed to be reasonable, and the\n\nburden of  showing unreasonableness must be  on the recipient\n\nwho seeks to avoid  compliance.\"  R. Enters., Inc.,  498 U.S.\n                                                  \n\nat 301.  \n\n     In his motion to quash the grand jury subpoena, Ferreira\n\nutterly    failed   to    meet   his   burden    of   showing\n\n                             -5-\n\nunreasonableness.  See In re Pantojas, 628 F.2d 701, 704 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1980) (ruling that appellant who claimed that grand jury\n\ninvestigation  was being  used  by prosecutor  to harass  him\n\nfailed to carry  his burden to  demonstrate why lineup  could\n\nnot be of use to grand  jury).  Indeed, his association  with\n\nthe other  suspects and,  in particular, his  connection with\n\nHickey,  with whom  he had  once committed  a  similar crime,\n\nsupport the legitimacy of the subpoena.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nSheehan,  583 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1978) (commenting that it\n       \n\nwould seem to be  respectable police work to check  out known\n\nassociates  of  a suspect  in  a  bank  robbery committed  by\n\nseveral  people).   But  cf. In  re Melvin,  550 F.2d  at 677\n                                          \n\n(suggesting  that it might be  an abuse of  the grand juries'\n\npower  \"to  call  certain  individuals  with  known  criminal\n\nproclivities  to  appear  repeatedly in  lineups\")  (emphasis\n                                    \n\nadded).  \n\n     In sum, we agree with the district court that Ferreira's\n\nmotion  to quash  should have  been denied regardless  of the\n\nchallenged  affidavit.4   Since  the new  evidence would  not\n\nhave produced a different result below, defendant's new trial\n\n                    \n\n4.  In so ruling, we refrain, as did the district court, from\nmaking any comment on whether the challenged  representations\nin the affidavit were misleading.\n\n                             -6-\n\nmotion fails to meet  the materiality prong of the  four part\n\ntest.  Accordingly, the motion was properly denied.5    \n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n5.  We also reject Ferreira's claim  that he should have been\ngiven a hearing on his motion for new trial.  Rule 33 motions\nare frequently ruled upon without hearing, see Lema, 909 F.2d\n                                                   \nat  568 n.10, and there was no need to conduct an evidentiary\nhearing here.\n\n                             -7-\n",

Ferreira was convicted of armed bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(d), conspiracy to commit bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, and use of a firearm during a crime of violence, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).  Following an aborted appeal from his conviction, and approximately two years after mandate issued, Ferreira filed a motion for new trial, pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 33, based on the ground of newly discovered evidence.  This evidence is a sealed affidavit of FBI Special Agent James Burleigh, which accompanied the government's opposition to defendant's motion to quash a grand jury subpoena.  The district court denied the motion for new trial, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed.  On October 18, 1988, the Bank of New England on Rockdale Street, Braintree, Massachusetts was robbed.  Shortly after the robbery, Lieutenant Donald Murphy of the Braintree Police Department observed four individuals descend an embankment in the South Shore Shopping Plaza, speak briefly, and then depart in two separate cars.  Believing that these four persons were the robbers, Lieutenant Murphy followed one of the two cars and arrested its occupants-John Maguire and Thomas Kavanagh.  The next day, Lieutenant Murphy was shown a photographic array, and identified Robert Hickey as the driver of the other car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately six weeks later, Ferreira received a grand jury subpoena to appear in a lineup.  Ferreira filed a motion to quash the subpoena, claiming that the subpoena was \"nothing more than harassment for his past activities.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government filed an opposition to the motion, supported by Special Agent Burleigh's affidavit.  The affidavit was filed in camera, ex parte, and was subsequently sealed upon motion by the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court denied the motion to quash and ordered Ferreira to appear in the line-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a lineup conducted on December 19, 1988, Lieutenant Murphy identified Ferreira as the fourth robber.  That same day, Ferreira was indicted by the grand jury.  Evidence of Lieutenant Murphy's identification of Ferreira at the lineup was later introduced at trial.  Ferreira was found guilty, and he appealed.  The appeal was dismissed on January 16, 1991, upon Ferreira's motion for voluntary dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1992, the government provided Ferreira with a copy of Special Agent Burleigh's sealed affidavit.  Ferreira then filed a motion for new trial contending, inter alia, that the affidavit contained two misleading statements and omitted material information.  Ferreira further argued that if the district court had been made aware of these alleged falsehoods, the court would have granted the motion to quash, the lineup would not have occurred, and the government would not have had enough evidence to make a case against him.  The district court denied the motion for new trial on the grounds that \"the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena was without basis and should have been denied regardless of the affidavit.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence will be denied unless the moving party can establish each facet of the following four-part test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial;  (2) the failure to learn of it was not a result of the defendant's poor diligence;  (3) the new evidence is material;  and (4) the impact of the new evidence is so strong that an acquittal would probably result upon retrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

We will not disturb the disposition of a new trial motion unless the district court abused its discretion or misapplied the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

We find no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigatory powers of the grand jury, although not unlimited, are necessarily broad.  See United States v. R. Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112523\"><a href=\"/opinion/112523/united-states-v-r-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 297 (1991) (stating that the function of the grand jury is to inquire into all information that might possibly bear on its investigation);   United States v. Dionisio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108709\"><a href=\"/opinion/108709/united-states-v-dionisio/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1973) (recognizing that the grand jury's investigatory powers include the right to \"act on tips, rumors, evidence offered by the prosecutor, or their own personal knowledge\").  We have explicitly recognized the power of the grand jury to direct witnesses to appear in a lineup.   In re Melvin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343376\"><a href=\"/opinion/343376/in-re-james-francis-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1977).  Although a judge, acting pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 17(c), has the power to quash a subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive, \"a grand jury subpoena issued through normal channels is presumed to be reasonable, and the burden of showing unreasonableness must be on the recipient who seeks to avoid compliance.\"  R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. at 301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his motion to quash the grand jury subpoena, Ferreira utterly failed to meet his burden of showing unreasonableness.   See In re Pantojas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381356\"><a href=\"/opinion/381356/in-re-carlos-rosario-pantojas/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir. 1980) (ruling that appellant who claimed that grand jury investigation was being used by prosecutor to harass him failed to carry his burden to demonstrate why lineup could not be of use to grand jury).  Indeed, his association with the other suspects and, in particular, his connection with Hickey, with whom he had once committed a similar crime, support the legitimacy of the subpoena.   See United States v. Sheehan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359496\"><a href=\"/opinion/359496/united-states-v-william-joseph-sheehan/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir. 1978) (commenting that it would seem to be respectable police work to check out known associates of a suspect in a bank robbery committed by several people).  But cf.  In re Melvin, 550 F.2d at 677 (suggesting that it might be an abuse of the grand juries' power \"to call certain individuals with known criminal proclivities to appear repeatedly in lineups\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we agree with the district court that Ferreira's motion to quash should have been denied regardless of the challenged affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Since the new evidence would not have produced a different result below, defendant's new trial motion fails to meet the materiality prong of the four part test.  Accordingly, the motion was properly denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In particular, Ferreira contended that the sole basis for the subpoena was his previous criminal record for bank robbery and his relationship with the other suspects.
