This case  involves\n                                      \n\nplaintiffs-appellants' attempts to recover $41,448.00 in U.S.\n\ncurrency,  which  was  seized   by  the  United  States  Drug\n\nEnforcement  Administration   (\"DEA\")   and  has   now   been\n\nforfeited.   In  their civil  action under  28 U.S.C.    1331\n\nagainst the DEA and its agents, plaintiffs appeal two rulings\n\nby  the  district court.    First,  plaintiffs challenge  the\n\ncourt's grant of partial  summary judgment for the defendants\n\nupon    its    finding   that    plaintiffs    had   received\n\nconstitutionally  adequate  notice   of  the   administrative\n\nforfeiture  proceeding.    Second, plaintiffs  challenge  the\n\ncourt's  dismissal of  the case  on the  basis that,  once it\n\ngranted  partial  summary  judgment  on  the  Fifth Amendment\n\nnotice  claim,   it  no  longer  had   jurisdiction  to  hear\n\nplaintiffs' Fourth  Amendment claim.  We  affirm the decision\n\nof the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          The procedural background of this case is important\n\nand we  rehearse it  in detail, proceeding  chronologically. \n\nOn  July 28,  1989,  DEA agents  seized  $41,448.00 from  the\n\nplaintiffs'  then-residence located  at 114  Alvin Street  in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.  The attendant search was conducted\n\nwithout a warrant.  On  August 21, 1989, plaintiffs'  counsel\n\nfiled a motion pursuant  to Fed. R. Crim. P.  41(e),1 seeking\n\nreturn of  the  currency.   On  September 1,  Assistant  U.S.\n\nAttorney Michael Iannotti objected to this motion and filed a\n\nmemorandum  of law  which  has played  a  focal role  in  the\n\narguments before this court.  In that memorandum, he informed\n\nplaintiffs and the district court that the currency was being\n\nheld  for  administrative  forfeiture pursuant  to  Title  21\n\nU.S.C.    881(d) and Title 19 U.S.C.    1607.  The memorandum\n\nprovided  the seizure  number that  had been assigned  to the\n\ncurrency.  The memorandum also stated  that \"a notice [would]\n\nbe  sent  to all  those  who  may  have  an interest  in  the\n\ncurrency,\" and  that \"publication [would] commence within the\n\nnext two  months.\"  The Assistant U.S.  Attorney averred that\n\nthe  assignment   of  a  seizure  number   would  permit  the\n\nplaintiffs  \"at any time, without waiting for the DEA to take\n                        \n\nany further action,  to file a claim  and cost bond  with the\n\nDEA thus causing  the DEA  to refer  the matter  to the  U.S.\n\nAttorney   for   the   initiation  of   judicial   forfeiture\n\nproceedings\" (emphasis in original).  \n\n                    \n\n1    Fed. R. Crim.  P. 41(e), Motion for  Return of Property,\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n     A  person  aggrieved  by  an  unlawful  search  and\n     seizure or by the  deprivation of property may move\n     the district  court for  the district in  which the\n     property was seized for  the return of the property\n     on  the  ground that  such  person  is entitled  to\n     lawful possession of the property.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          On or about  September 19, the  DEA sent notice  of\n\nthe administrative forfeiture proceeding by certified mail to\n\n114  Alvin Street, where the  currency had been  seized.  The\n\nnotice  contained required  information, not included  in the\n\nmemorandum,  concerning procedures to  be followed, deadlines\n\nto be met, and the right  of a petitioner to proceed in forma\n                                                             \n\npauperis in lieu of the posting of a cost bond.   This notice\n        \n\nwas  subsequently returned to  the DEA \"unclaimed.\"   The DEA\n\nmade no  further attempts to  notify the plaintiffs  or their\n\ncounsel of the pending  forfeiture other than by publication.\n\n          On September  21, following  a conference with  the\n\ncourt pursuant to the 41(e) motion, plaintiffs sent a  letter\n\nto the  DEA advising it  of their  intention to file  a claim\n\nunder the  Federal Tort Claims  Act.   The first  publication\n\nnotice, marking the beginning  of the twenty-day period after\n\nwhich plaintiffs' right  to file a claim  and to post a  cost\n\nbond would  expire, appeared in  the newspaper USA  Today, on\n                                                         \n\nSeptember 27.  On  October 13, the district court  denied the\n\nplaintiffs' 41(e)  motion on equitable grounds,  deferring to\n\nthe administrative  forfeiture proceedings.   The plaintiffs'\n\nright to file a claim with the DEA expired on October 17.  On\n\nNovember 2,  the  administrative forfeiture  was decreed  and\n\nentered.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n          On  November 8,  the  plaintiffs,  having  procured\n\nmoney to post a cost bond, filed a formal claim with the DEA.\n\nPlaintiffs  also moved  for  reconsideration of  their  41(e)\n\nmotion.  On  December 21, defendants  objected to the  motion\n\nfor  reconsideration  and  included,  in  their  accompanying\n\nmemorandum,  the information  that the  currency had  already\n\nbeen   administratively  forfeited.      The   court   denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion  as moot  because the forfeiture  had been\n\ncompleted.    After learning  that  their  property had  been\n\nforfeited, plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the forfeiture\n\non December 29, which  motion was dismissed by the  court for\n\nlack  of  jurisdiction.    Underscoring  its  awareness  that\n\nplaintiffs had been trying to resolve this matter for several\n\nmonths, the  court advised plaintiffs  in its order  that the\n\nproper method for collateral attack was a civil rights action\n\nunder Title 28 U.S.C.   1331.\n\n          Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a civil  rights action\n\nagainst the DEA and  its agents alleging violations of  their\n\nrights  under  the  Fifth  Amendment,  claiming  insufficient\n\nnotice of the administrative proceeding, and under the Fourth\n\nAmendment,  claiming  that the  currency  was  seized in  the\n\ncourse  of  a  warrantless,  non-consensual  search.      The\n\ndistrict  court  initially  denied  defendants'   motions  to\n\ndismiss and for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs\n\nhad stated a valid cause of action under 28 U.S.C.   1331, by\n\n                             -7-\n\npleading violations  of the Fourth and  Fifth Amendments, and\n\nthat  sovereign immunity was  waived under the Administrative\n\nProcedures  Act, 5  U.S.C.    701 et  seq.   The court  found\n                                         \n\nsummary judgment inappropriate because of a dispute regarding\n\nconsent  in the Fourth Amendment claim, and the need for more\n\nevidence on the issue of adequate notice underlying the Fifth\n\nAmendment claim. \n\n          Both  parties  later  filed  motions   for  partial\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of the adequacy of notice.  The\n\ndistrict  court, on  July 15,  1991, granted  partial summary\n\njudgment for the  defendants on the notice issue,  finding it\n\nconstitutionally  sufficient  that  the government  had  sent\n\nnotice  to the  address  from  which  the currency  had  been\n\nseized.   The court buttressed  its conclusion with  the fact\n\nthat plaintiffs had  received the  Assistant U.S.  Attorney's\n\nSeptember  1  memorandum  putting   them  on  notice  that  a\n\nforfeiture proceeding would ensue.  \n\n          Trial on the Fourth  Amendment issue began on March\n\n11.  The  defendants moved  to dismiss the  case for lack  of\n\njurisdiction.   The plaintiffs  moved for  reconsideration of\n\nthe court's grant  of partial summary judgment  on the notice\n\nissue.    Upon deciding  not to  alter  its grant  of summary\n\njudgment,  the   court  dismissed   the  case  for   lack  of\n\njurisdiction finding that, because  the notice issue had been\n\nresolved against plaintiffs, they  thereby lost the waiver of\n\n                             -8-\n\nsovereign immunity  that had  allowed the court  to entertain\n\nthe case in the first instance. \n\n                             II.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.   Notice/Due Process\n                       \n\n          We  begin  by  addressing  plaintiffs'  claim  that\n\ndefendants   failed  adequately   to  notify   them  of   the\n\nadministrative forfeiture proceeding.    Because the district\n\ncourt granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on this\n\nissue, our  review is  plenary, and  we construe all  factual\n\ninferences in  favor of plaintiffs.   See Damaris Rivera-Ruiz\n                                                             \n\nv. Leonardo Gonzalez-Rivera, No. 92-1558, slip. op. at 2 (1st\n                           \n\nCir.  Jan. 5, 1993) (citing E.H. Ashley  &amp; Co. v.

Written\n     notice of seizure together with information  on the\n     applicable procedures  shall be sent to  each party\n     who  appears  to have  an  interest  in the  seized\n     article.\n\nThe  regulations  interpreting  the  publication  requirement\n\nprovide  for   publication   in  \"a   newspaper  of   general\n\ncirculation in the judicial  district in which the processing\n\nfor forfeiture is  brought.\"  21 C.F.R.    1316.75(a) (1992).\n\nThe publication notice must do the following:\n\n     (1) Describe the property seized and show the motor\n     and  serial numbers,  if any;  (2) state  the time,\n     cause, and place of seizure; and (3) state that any\n     person desiring to  claim the property  may, within\n     20  days from the date  of first publication of the\n     notice,  file  with  the  custodian  or  DEA  Asset\n     Forfeiture Section  a claim  to the property  and a\n     bond  with  satisfactory  sureties in  the  sum  of\n     $5,000 or ten percent  of the value of the  claimed\n     property  whichever is  lower,  but  not less  than\n     $250.  \n\n21 C.F.R.   1316.75(b) (1992).\n\n          There  is no  dispute that  defendants sent  notice\n\nwith  all  required  information to  plaintiffs'  last  known\n\naddress,  the address  from  which the  currency was  seized.\n\nThere is also no dispute that defendants issued proper notice\n\nby publication.  Thus, defendants met the requirements of the\n\nstatute.  \n\n          Plaintiffs  contend  that   defendants  failed   to\n\nsatisfy the notice requirements of the  Due Process Clause of\n\nthe  Fifth  Amendment.    Relying upon  the  Supreme  Court's\n\nopinion in Mullane v.  Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust  Co., 339\n                                                        \n\n                             -10-\n\nU.S. 306, 314  (1950), plaintiffs  argue that  the notice  in\n\nthis  case  was not  \"reasonably  calculated,  under all  the\n\ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the  pendency\n\nof the action and afford them an opportunity to present their\n\nobjections.\"  Plaintiffs do not facially challenge the notice\n\nprovisions in the statute, but draw our attention  to special\n\n\"circumstances\" affecting  the question of whether  the DEA's\n\nnotice was so \"reasonably calculated.\"  See id.  \n                                               \n\n          It is  plaintiffs' position that the  DEA was fully\n\naware of their interest  in the seized currency,  given their\n\npursuit  of their 41(e) motion,  and their letter  to the DEA\n\ninforming the DEA that they intended to take action under the\n\nFTCA.   Plaintiffs point out that  the DEA also  was aware of\n\ntheir  representation  by  counsel  and  of  their  counsel's\n\nidentity  and address.2   Once the DEA received an indication\n\nthat the  notice  had been  returned \"unclaimed,\"  plaintiffs\n\nassert, it would have been  simple to ascertain from  counsel\n\ntheir  current address, as would it have been to notify their\n\ncounsel directly of the pending forfeiture.   Cf. Robinson v.\n                                                          \n\nHanrahan, 409 U.S. 38, 40 (1972) (per curiam) (citing Mullane\n                                                             \n\nfor   the  proposition   that  notice   by  publication   was\n\ninsufficient where plaintiffs' names and addresses were known\n\nor \"easily ascertainable\").  \n\n                    \n\n2   Plaintiffs treat  the government, the  U.S. Attorney  for\nRhode Island and the DEA in Washington, as a single entity.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n      We  find   that  the   DEA  acted  reasonably   on  the\n\ninformation  it had when notice was sent by mailing notice to\n\nthe  address from  which the  property was  seized.   We need\n\ndetermine only whether the DEA's duty changed in the light of\n\nits  subsequent discovery  that  the mailed  notice had  been\n\nineffective.   Given  plaintiffs'  vigorous (although  tardy)\n\npursuit of their claim, the fact that the government had been\n\ninvolved in ongoing  court action  on the very  issue of  the\n\nseizure of  plaintiffs' currency, the  government's awareness\n\nof  plaintiffs' representation  by  counsel, and  the frowned\n\nupon treatment of forfeitures, the call  is a close one.  See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally United  States v.

Nevertheless, Mullane  counsels us\n                                                \n\nto consider all  of the  circumstances, and we  find in  this\n               \n\ncase  other  pertinent  factors,  including  the government's\n\nmemorandum  and  the conduct  of  plaintiffs' counsel,  which\n\ncompel  us to uphold the finding of  the district court.  For\n\nthe  reasons that  follow, we  hold  that defendants  met the\n\nminimum threshold requirements of due process.  \n\n     1.   Mullane and its Progeny \n                                 \n\n          We  note at  the onset  that while  Mullane clearly\n                                                     \n\ncontemplates  inquiry  into   the  \"peculiarities\"  and   the\n\n                             -12-\n\n\"practicalities\" of a given  case, it has not  generally been\n\ninterpreted to  require a  party to make  additional attempts\n\nbeyond  notice that is legally satisfactory at the time it is\n\nsent.   See Mullane, 339 U.S. at  314-15.  The Court has read\n                   \n\nan  implicit  bad faith  standard  into  the notice  inquiry,\n\noverturning notice even where formal procedures were followed\n\nif the notifying party knew or had reason to know that notice\n\nwould be ineffective.  See,  e.g., Robinson v. Hanrahan,  409\n                                                       \n\nU.S.  37 (1972)  (per curiam)  (in forfeiture  action, notice\n\nmailed  to interested  party's  home address  was  inadequate\n\nwhere  government knew party was incarcerated awaiting trial,\n\nand  where party  remained in  custody  throughout forfeiture\n\nproceedings and  did not  receive notice until  his release);\n\nCovey  v. Town of Somers, 351 U.S. 141 (1956) (in foreclosure\n                        \n\naction,  notice  by  publication,  mailing  and  posting  was\n                                               \n\ninadequate where individual involved was known by the town to\n\nbe mentally disabled and under the protection of a guardian).\n\nKnowledge  of  the  likely  effectiveness of  the  notice  is\n\nmeasured from the moment at which the notice was sent.  \n\n          Virtually  all   of  the   cases  relied   upon  by\n\nplaintiffs  share the  feature--missing from  this case--that\n\nthe government knew at the time  the notice was sent that the\n\nnotice  was  likely  to  be  ineffective.3    See  Fisher  v.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n3     Only in  one  case cited  by plaintiffs  did the  court\nrequire  the DEA, absent any  evidence of bad  faith, to make\nadditional attempts  to notify the defendant  when notice was\n\n                             -13-\n\nStutman, Nos. 85-3133-MA,  85-4307-MA, 1987 U.S. Dist.

See Montgomery v.  Scott, 802 F.  Supp.\n                                              \n930 (W.D.N.Y.  1992).   Interestingly, the court  relied upon\nthe  fact  that  the  plaintiff was  being  prosecuted  in  a\ncriminal  action  and that  the  DEA could  have  reached him\nthrough  that  vehicle.    Unlike  the  case  before  us,  in\nMontgomery, the  claimant had no actual  notice whatsoever of\n          \nthe pendency of the forfeiture proceeding. \n\n                             -14-\n\n     2.   Circumstances Affecting the Adequacy of the Notice\n                                                            \n\n          Rather  than  uncovering exceptional  circumstances\n\ncompelling us to find that the government had a duty over and\n\nabove  reasonable and technical satisfaction of the statutory\n\nrequirements, we find that the damage done by the ineffective\n\nnotice could  and ought to  have been stemmed  by plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel.   The  Assistant U.S.  Attorney's memorandum  to the\n\ndistrict court objecting to plaintiffs' Rule 41(e) motion put\n\ncounsel on  notice that a forfeiture proceeding would ensue. \n\nEven though, as counsel for plaintiffs argued, the memorandum\n\ndid  not  specify an  exact  time  of  publication, and  thus\n\ncounsel lacked  a precise indication  of the date  from which\n\nthe twenty-day period would  run, he certainly had sufficient\n\ngeneral  notice  of  the  risk that  the  property  would  be\n\nforfeited  within  the  coming  months  if  action  were  not\n\ntaken.4    The statute  covering  forfeitures  (cited in  the\n\nmemorandum)   and  the  regulations   interpreting  it,  were\n\navailable to  counsel.   The regulations plainly  explain the\n\nconsequence of forfeiture in  twenty days.  Counsel  had only\n\nto look to these sources.\n\n                    \n\n4   The Assistant  U.S. Attorney's  memorandum  was filed  on\nSeptember  1, 1989.   The  DEA could  have published  notice,\nthereby   beginning  the   twenty-day  period   during  which\nplaintiffs  could challenge  the forfeiture,  any time  after\nthat  date.  Plaintiffs' did not file a formal claim with the\nDEA until November 8, more than two months later.   \n\n                             -15-\n\n          We also do not credit plaintiffs' argument that the\n\nAssistant  U.S.  Attorney's  reference  to   the  plaintiffs'\n\nability to  initiate action \"at any  time,\" caused confusion,\n\nin  effect  sanctioning  plaintiffs'  delay.    Although  the\n\nmemorandum might well have confused plaintiffs had it gone to\n\nthem  directly, it ought not to  have confused their counsel.\n\nCounsel is  charged  with  knowledge of  the  law,  and  that\n\nknowledge is imputed to plaintiffs.  Moreover, in the context\n\nin  which  the  phrase appeared,  we  do  not  find that  the\n\nstatement, \"at  any time,\" was deliberately  misleading.  The\n\nstatement  was part  of  the government's  argument that  the\n\ncourt should  decline to exercise its  equitable powers under\n\nRule 41(e), because of the availability of the at-law  remedy\n\nprovided  by the  forfeiture  statute and  regulations.   The\n\nargument pointed  out the  plaintiffs' ability to  move under\n\nRule 41(e) more  quickly than the government could process an\n\nadministrative forfeiture.  The  U.S. Attorney was making the\n\npoint  that no  undue delay  would be caused  plaintiffs, who\n\ncould go  ahead and  challenge the administrative  proceeding\n\nwithout waiting,  should the  court decide to  defer to  that\n\nproceeding. \n\n       In  addition  to  putting  counsel on  notice  of  the\n\nforfeiture, the memorandum contained a seizure  number, which\n\ncounsel could  have  used  to  ascertain the  status  of  the\n\naction,  and to obtain from  the DEA the  anticipated date of\n\n                             -16-\n\npublication notice.   Although  the duty of  providing notice\n\nlies  plainly with  the government,  once the  plaintiffs and\n\ntheir counsel were aware that  notice of the forfeiture would\n\nbe sent in the  ensuing two months, they could  have notified\n\nthe  DEA of  their own  change of  address--they were  in the\n\nbetter position as far as that information was concerned. \n\n          Plaintiffs'  explanation for their delay in posting\n\nthe  cost bond  and  thereby challenging  the forfeiture  was\n\ntheir difficulty in coming up with the funds to do so.  It is\n\nunfortunate that plaintiffs did not receive the notice mailed\n\nby the  DEA which plainly  explains the  right of a  poor and\n\nneedy  claimant  to proceed  in  forma  pauperis in  lieu  of\n                                                \n\nposting the cost bond.  Once again, however, plaintiffs  were\n\nrepresented by counsel; counsel  is charged with knowledge of\n\nhis  clients'  rights  to  proceed  in  forma  pauperis,  and\n                                                       \n\ncounsel's knowledge is imputed to his clients. \n\n          We  are not  entirely unsympathetic  to plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the circumstances affecting notice were altered\n\nby the  government's ongoing  involvement with plaintiffs  in\n\nlitigation  over the  return of  the  seized property  and by\n\nplaintiffs' persistent pursuit of their rights.  No doubt the\n\ngovernment could have  ascertained from plaintiffs'  attorney\n\ntheir current address.   We  are also troubled  by the  DEA's\n\nchoice  of publication notice in  USA Today, which  we do not\n                                           \n\nconsider   a  particularly   effective  notice   vehicle  for\n\n                             -17-\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.  The  regulations, however, require\n\nonly a  publication \"of  general circulation in  the judicial\n\ndistrict in  which the . .  . forfeiture is brought,\"  and we\n\nfind no violation of due process in this regard.  21 C.F.R.  \n\n1316.75(a).  The government's conduct  simply did not rise to\n\na violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nB.   Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction\n                                       \n\n          We next  review the district  court's dismissal  of\n\nthe case on  the basis that it lost jurisdiction  to hear the\n\nremaining Fourth  Amendment claim  once the notice  issue was\n\nresolved  against  plaintiffs.    This  issue  poses  a  pure\n\nquestion  of  law.   Therefore,  our  standard of  review  is\n\nplenary.   See Liberty Mutual  Ins. Co.  v. Commercial  Union\n                                                             \n\nIns. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir. 1992). \n        \n\n          Because  the plaintiffs' Fourth  Amendment claim is\n\ndirected at the  DEA, an  agency of the  United States,  this\n\nissue  involves the  United States'  waiver of  its sovereign\n\nimmunity.   Only an express waiver of sovereign immunity will\n\ngive  a court jurisdiction to hear a claim against the United\n\nStates.  Lehman  v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 161  (1981).  The\n                            \n\nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5  U.S.C.   702, provides such\n\n                             -18-\n\na  waiver  for  certain forms  of  equitable  relief.5   That\n\nwaiver   is,  however,  limited  by  APA,  5  U.S.C.     701.\n\nSpecifically  relevant to  this  case is    701(a)(1),  which\n\nlimits waiver where \"statutes preclude judicial review.\"  The\n\nissue  presented is  whether the  forfeiture statute  and the\n\nregulations  implementing  it,  by providing  an  avenue  for\n\njudicial  relief,  constitute  a  statute  precluding  review\n\nwithin the meaning of   701(a)(1).\n\n          The district court originally obtained jurisdiction\n\nover this case due to plaintiffs' claim that constitutionally\n\ndeficient notice prevented them,  in the first instance, from\n\nmeeting the deadlines necessary  to pursue judicial relief as\n\nprovided by the forfeiture  statute and regulations.  Whereas\n\nmost  challenges  to  forfeiture  would be  foreclosed  by  a\n\n                    \n\n5   Administrative  Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C.    702, provides\nin pertinent part:\n\n     A  person suffering legal  wrong because  of agency\n     action,  or  adversely  affected  or  aggrieved  by\n     agency  action within  the  meaning of  a  relevant\n     statute,  is entitled  to judicial  review thereof.\n     An action in  a court of the  United States seeking\n     relief other than money damages and stating a claim\n     that an  agency or  an officer or  employee thereof\n     acted or failed  to act in an official  capacity or\n     under  color  of  legal   authority  shall  not  be\n     dismissed  nor  relief  therein  be  denied  on the\n     ground that it is  against the United States .  . .\n     Nothing  herein  (1) affects  other  limitations on\n     judicial review or the  power or duty of the  court\n     to dismiss any  action or deny relief  on any other\n     appropriate  legal  or  equitable  ground;  or  (2)\n     confers  authority to  grant  relief  if any  other\n     statute that  grants consent to  suit expressly  or\n     impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\n\n                             -19-\n\nplaintiffs' failure to  utilize the  mechanism for  obtaining\n\njudicial  relief  provided  in  the  forfeiture  statute  and\n\nregulations,  courts  have   entertained  challenges  to  the\n\nadequacy  of  notice, reasoning  that  the  mechanism is  not\n\navailable  to a plaintiff who is not properly notified of the\n\npending  forfeiture.   See, e.g.,  Marshall Leasing,  Inc. v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 893 F.2d 1096, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 1990); Willis\n                                                             \n\nv. United States, 787 F.2d 1089, 1092-93 (7th Cir. 1986). \n                \n\n          Once  the district  court found,  as have  we, that\n\nnotice was constitutionally sufficient, it further determined\n\nthat    701(a)(1) applied to deny the court jurisdiction over\n\nthe remainder of the  case.  The court found  that plaintiffs\n\nhad had  the means available under the  forfeiture statute to\n\ntake the case  to a judicial forum, and that  they had failed\n\nto do so.  See Sarit v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 796 F. Supp.\n                                               \n\n55, 59 (D.R.I. 1992)  (\"The forfeiture statute `clearly makes\n\navailable to  a claimant  invoking the remedy  an appropriate\n\nforum  in  which  to  test  the  legality  of  the  contested\n\nseizure.'\"   (citation  omitted)).     Concluding   that  the\n\nforfeiture statute was a \"statute\" which \"preclude[d] review\"\n\nunder    701(a)(1), because the statutory  scheme provided an\n\navenue for judicial relief,  the district court dismissed the\n\ncase.\n\n          The  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  assessing\n\nwhether Congress  intends to  preclude  judicial review,  the\n\n                             -20-\n\nintention  need not be found  in the express  language of the\n\nstatute, but should  be determined from the structure  of the\n\nstatutory  scheme and  from  its objectives.    See Block  v.\n                                                         \n\nCommunity  Nutrition Inst.,  467 U.S. 340,  345 (1984).   The\n                          \n\ndistrict court correctly interpreted   701(a)(1) to find that\n\nthe  forfeiture statute  precluded  judicial  review in  this\n\ncase.\n\n          Plaintiffs  ask  us  to  extend the  exception  for\n\nconstitutionally deficient notice to hear the merits of their\n\nFifth  Amendment claim.  It  is their position  that, even if\n\nthe notice  was constitutionally  adequate, it still  was not\n                                          \n\neffective.  In practical terms, plaintiffs claim, they had no\n         \n\nknowledge of  the deadlines for filing a cost bond.  Absent a\n\nlegal defect  in the notice,  however, we cannot  correct any\n\nresidual  ineffectiveness  if  such  there be,  by  extending\n\njurisdiction  where Congress  has  spoken otherwise.     Once\n\nagain,   we  are  sympathetic   with  plaintiffs'  frustrated\n\nattempts to obtain a hearing on the merits.  We are, however,\n\nbound  by the  rule of  law and  the adversary  process.   We\n\ncannot  come  in, deus  ex machina,  and  save a  claim where\n                                  \n\nnotice is constitutionally sufficient and any failures in its\n\neffectiveness  should  have  been  corrected  by  plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel.\n\nC.   Equitable Jurisdiction\n                           \n\n                             -21-\n\n          Plaintiffs' final request  is that  we reach  their\n\nFourth Amendment  claim by  invoking our powers  of equitable\n\njurisdiction.  The government, in  its brief, argued that the\n\nissue was not raised  below.  At oral argument,  attorney for\n\nplaintiffs claimed  that the issue  had been briefed  for the\n\ndistrict  court.  We find, however, no evidence in the record\n\nthat this issue  had been raised  before the district  court.\n\nWe are, therefore, precluded  from entertaining it on appeal.\n\nSee United States v.

This case  involves\n                                      \n\nplaintiffs-appellants' attempts to recover $41,448.00 in U.S.\n\ncurrency,  which  was  seized   by  the  United  States  Drug\n\nEnforcement  Administration   (\"DEA\")   and  has   now   been\n\nforfeited.   In  their civil  action under  28 U.S.C.    1331\n\nagainst the DEA and its agents, plaintiffs appeal two rulings\n\nby  the  district court.    First,  plaintiffs challenge  the\n\ncourt's grant of partial  summary judgment for the defendants\n\nupon    its    finding   that    plaintiffs    had   received\n\nconstitutionally  adequate  notice   of  the   administrative\n\nforfeiture  proceeding.    Second, plaintiffs  challenge  the\n\ncourt's  dismissal of  the case  on the  basis that,  once it\n\ngranted  partial  summary  judgment  on  the  Fifth Amendment\n\nnotice  claim,   it  no  longer  had   jurisdiction  to  hear\n\nplaintiffs' Fourth  Amendment claim.  We  affirm the decision\n\nof the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          The procedural background of this case is important\n\nand we  rehearse it  in detail, proceeding  chronologically. \n\nOn  July 28,  1989,  DEA agents  seized  $41,448.00 from  the\n\nplaintiffs'  then-residence located  at 114  Alvin Street  in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.  The attendant search was conducted\n\nwithout a warrant.  On  August 21, 1989, plaintiffs'  counsel\n\nfiled a motion pursuant  to Fed. R. Crim. P.  41(e),1 seeking\n\nreturn of  the  currency.   On  September 1,  Assistant  U.S.\n\nAttorney Michael Iannotti objected to this motion and filed a\n\nmemorandum  of law  which  has played  a  focal role  in  the\n\narguments before this court.  In that memorandum, he informed\n\nplaintiffs and the district court that the currency was being\n\nheld  for  administrative  forfeiture pursuant  to  Title  21\n\nU.S.C.    881(d) and Title 19 U.S.C.    1607.  The memorandum\n\nprovided  the seizure  number that  had been assigned  to the\n\ncurrency.  The memorandum also stated  that \"a notice [would]\n\nbe  sent  to all  those  who  may  have  an interest  in  the\n\ncurrency,\" and  that \"publication [would] commence within the\n\nnext two  months.\"  The Assistant U.S.  Attorney averred that\n\nthe  assignment   of  a  seizure  number   would  permit  the\n\nplaintiffs  \"at any time, without waiting for the DEA to take\n                        \n\nany further action,  to file a claim  and cost bond  with the\n\nDEA thus causing  the DEA  to refer  the matter  to the  U.S.\n\nAttorney   for   the   initiation  of   judicial   forfeiture\n\nproceedings\" (emphasis in original).  \n\n                    \n\n1    Fed. R. Crim.  P. 41(e), Motion for  Return of Property,\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n     A  person  aggrieved  by  an  unlawful  search  and\n     seizure or by the  deprivation of property may move\n     the district  court for  the district in  which the\n     property was seized for  the return of the property\n     on  the  ground that  such  person  is entitled  to\n     lawful possession of the property.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          On or about  September 19, the  DEA sent notice  of\n\nthe administrative forfeiture proceeding by certified mail to\n\n114  Alvin Street, where the  currency had been  seized.  The\n\nnotice  contained required  information, not included  in the\n\nmemorandum,  concerning procedures to  be followed, deadlines\n\nto be met, and the right  of a petitioner to proceed in forma\n                                                             \n\npauperis in lieu of the posting of a cost bond.   This notice\n        \n\nwas  subsequently returned to  the DEA \"unclaimed.\"   The DEA\n\nmade no  further attempts to  notify the plaintiffs  or their\n\ncounsel of the pending  forfeiture other than by publication.\n\n          On September  21, following  a conference with  the\n\ncourt pursuant to the 41(e) motion, plaintiffs sent a  letter\n\nto the  DEA advising it  of their  intention to file  a claim\n\nunder the  Federal Tort Claims  Act.   The first  publication\n\nnotice, marking the beginning  of the twenty-day period after\n\nwhich plaintiffs' right  to file a claim  and to post a  cost\n\nbond would  expire, appeared in  the newspaper USA  Today, on\n                                                         \n\nSeptember 27.  On  October 13, the district court  denied the\n\nplaintiffs' 41(e)  motion on equitable grounds,  deferring to\n\nthe administrative  forfeiture proceedings.   The plaintiffs'\n\nright to file a claim with the DEA expired on October 17.  On\n\nNovember 2,  the  administrative forfeiture  was decreed  and\n\nentered.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n          On  November 8,  the  plaintiffs,  having  procured\n\nmoney to post a cost bond, filed a formal claim with the DEA.\n\nPlaintiffs  also moved  for  reconsideration of  their  41(e)\n\nmotion.  On  December 21, defendants  objected to the  motion\n\nfor  reconsideration  and  included,  in  their  accompanying\n\nmemorandum,  the information  that the  currency had  already\n\nbeen   administratively  forfeited.      The   court   denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion  as moot  because the forfeiture  had been\n\ncompleted.    After learning  that  their  property had  been\n\nforfeited, plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the forfeiture\n\non December 29, which  motion was dismissed by the  court for\n\nlack  of  jurisdiction.    Underscoring  its  awareness  that\n\nplaintiffs had been trying to resolve this matter for several\n\nmonths, the  court advised plaintiffs  in its order  that the\n\nproper method for collateral attack was a civil rights action\n\nunder Title 28 U.S.C.   1331.\n\n          Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a civil  rights action\n\nagainst the DEA and  its agents alleging violations of  their\n\nrights  under  the  Fifth  Amendment,  claiming  insufficient\n\nnotice of the administrative proceeding, and under the Fourth\n\nAmendment,  claiming  that the  currency  was  seized in  the\n\ncourse  of  a  warrantless,  non-consensual  search.      The\n\ndistrict  court  initially  denied  defendants'   motions  to\n\ndismiss and for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs\n\nhad stated a valid cause of action under 28 U.S.C.   1331, by\n\n                             -7-\n\npleading violations  of the Fourth and  Fifth Amendments, and\n\nthat  sovereign immunity was  waived under the Administrative\n\nProcedures  Act, 5  U.S.C.    701 et  seq.   The court  found\n                                         \n\nsummary judgment inappropriate because of a dispute regarding\n\nconsent  in the Fourth Amendment claim, and the need for more\n\nevidence on the issue of adequate notice underlying the Fifth\n\nAmendment claim. \n\n          Both  parties  later  filed  motions   for  partial\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of the adequacy of notice.  The\n\ndistrict  court, on  July 15,  1991, granted  partial summary\n\njudgment for the  defendants on the notice issue,  finding it\n\nconstitutionally  sufficient  that  the government  had  sent\n\nnotice  to the  address  from  which  the currency  had  been\n\nseized.   The court buttressed  its conclusion with  the fact\n\nthat plaintiffs had  received the  Assistant U.S.  Attorney's\n\nSeptember  1  memorandum  putting   them  on  notice  that  a\n\nforfeiture proceeding would ensue.  \n\n          Trial on the Fourth  Amendment issue began on March\n\n11.  The  defendants moved  to dismiss the  case for lack  of\n\njurisdiction.   The plaintiffs  moved for  reconsideration of\n\nthe court's grant  of partial summary judgment  on the notice\n\nissue.    Upon deciding  not to  alter  its grant  of summary\n\njudgment,  the   court  dismissed   the  case  for   lack  of\n\njurisdiction finding that, because  the notice issue had been\n\nresolved against plaintiffs, they  thereby lost the waiver of\n\n                             -8-\n\nsovereign immunity  that had  allowed the court  to entertain\n\nthe case in the first instance. \n\n                             II.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.   Notice/Due Process\n                       \n\n          We  begin  by  addressing  plaintiffs'  claim  that\n\ndefendants   failed  adequately   to  notify   them  of   the\n\nadministrative forfeiture proceeding.    Because the district\n\ncourt granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on this\n\nissue, our  review is  plenary, and  we construe all  factual\n\ninferences in  favor of plaintiffs.

Thus, defendants met the requirements of the\n\nstatute.  \n\n          Plaintiffs  contend  that   defendants  failed   to\n\nsatisfy the notice requirements of the  Due Process Clause of\n\nthe  Fifth  Amendment.

Plaintiffs point out that  the DEA also  was aware of\n\ntheir  representation  by  counsel  and  of  their  counsel's\n\nidentity  and address.2   Once the DEA received an indication\n\nthat the  notice  had been  returned \"unclaimed,\"  plaintiffs\n\nassert, it would have been  simple to ascertain from  counsel\n\ntheir  current address, as would it have been to notify their\n\ncounsel directly of the pending forfeiture.

Interestingly, the court  relied upon\nthe  fact  that  the  plaintiff was  being  prosecuted  in  a\ncriminal  action  and that  the  DEA could  have  reached him\nthrough  that  vehicle.    Unlike  the  case  before  us,  in\nMontgomery, the  claimant had no actual  notice whatsoever of\n          \nthe pendency of the forfeiture proceeding. \n\n                             -14-\n\n     2.   Circumstances Affecting the Adequacy of the Notice\n                                                            \n\n          Rather  than  uncovering exceptional  circumstances\n\ncompelling us to find that the government had a duty over and\n\nabove  reasonable and technical satisfaction of the statutory\n\nrequirements, we find that the damage done by the ineffective\n\nnotice could  and ought to  have been stemmed  by plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel.   The  Assistant U.S.  Attorney's memorandum  to the\n\ndistrict court objecting to plaintiffs' Rule 41(e) motion put\n\ncounsel on  notice that a forfeiture proceeding would ensue. \n\nEven though, as counsel for plaintiffs argued, the memorandum\n\ndid  not  specify an  exact  time  of  publication, and  thus\n\ncounsel lacked  a precise indication  of the date  from which\n\nthe twenty-day period would  run, he certainly had sufficient\n\ngeneral  notice  of  the  risk that  the  property  would  be\n\nforfeited  within  the  coming  months  if  action  were  not\n\ntaken.4    The statute  covering  forfeitures  (cited in  the\n\nmemorandum)   and  the  regulations   interpreting  it,  were\n\navailable to  counsel.   The regulations plainly  explain the\n\nconsequence of forfeiture in  twenty days.  Counsel  had only\n\nto look to these sources.\n\n                    \n\n4   The Assistant  U.S. Attorney's  memorandum  was filed  on\nSeptember  1, 1989.   The  DEA could  have published  notice,\nthereby   beginning  the   twenty-day  period   during  which\nplaintiffs  could challenge  the forfeiture,  any time  after\nthat  date.  Plaintiffs' did not file a formal claim with the\nDEA until November 8, more than two months later.   \n\n                             -15-\n\n          We also do not credit plaintiffs' argument that the\n\nAssistant  U.S.  Attorney's  reference  to   the  plaintiffs'\n\nability to  initiate action \"at any  time,\" caused confusion,\n\nin  effect  sanctioning  plaintiffs'  delay.    Although  the\n\nmemorandum might well have confused plaintiffs had it gone to\n\nthem  directly, it ought not to  have confused their counsel.\n\nCounsel is  charged  with  knowledge of  the  law,  and  that\n\nknowledge is imputed to plaintiffs.  Moreover, in the context\n\nin  which  the  phrase appeared,  we  do  not  find that  the\n\nstatement, \"at  any time,\" was deliberately  misleading.  The\n\nstatement  was part  of  the government's  argument that  the\n\ncourt should  decline to exercise its  equitable powers under\n\nRule 41(e), because of the availability of the at-law  remedy\n\nprovided  by the  forfeiture  statute and  regulations.   The\n\nargument pointed  out the  plaintiffs' ability to  move under\n\nRule 41(e) more  quickly than the government could process an\n\nadministrative forfeiture.  The  U.S. Attorney was making the\n\npoint  that no  undue delay  would be caused  plaintiffs, who\n\ncould go  ahead and  challenge the administrative  proceeding\n\nwithout waiting,  should the  court decide to  defer to  that\n\nproceeding. \n\n       In  addition  to  putting  counsel on  notice  of  the\n\nforfeiture, the memorandum contained a seizure  number, which\n\ncounsel could  have  used  to  ascertain the  status  of  the\n\naction,  and to obtain from  the DEA the  anticipated date of\n\n                             -16-\n\npublication notice.   Although  the duty of  providing notice\n\nlies  plainly with  the government,  once the  plaintiffs and\n\ntheir counsel were aware that  notice of the forfeiture would\n\nbe sent in the  ensuing two months, they could  have notified\n\nthe  DEA of  their own  change of  address--they were  in the\n\nbetter position as far as that information was concerned. \n\n          Plaintiffs'  explanation for their delay in posting\n\nthe  cost bond  and  thereby challenging  the forfeiture  was\n\ntheir difficulty in coming up with the funds to do so.  It is\n\nunfortunate that plaintiffs did not receive the notice mailed\n\nby the  DEA which plainly  explains the  right of a  poor and\n\nneedy  claimant  to proceed  in  forma  pauperis in  lieu  of\n                                                \n\nposting the cost bond.  Once again, however, plaintiffs  were\n\nrepresented by counsel; counsel  is charged with knowledge of\n\nhis  clients'  rights  to  proceed  in  forma  pauperis,  and\n                                                       \n\ncounsel's knowledge is imputed to his clients. \n\n          We  are not  entirely unsympathetic  to plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the circumstances affecting notice were altered\n\nby the  government's ongoing  involvement with plaintiffs  in\n\nlitigation  over the  return of  the  seized property  and by\n\nplaintiffs' persistent pursuit of their rights.  No doubt the\n\ngovernment could have  ascertained from plaintiffs'  attorney\n\ntheir current address.   We  are also troubled  by the  DEA's\n\nchoice  of publication notice in  USA Today, which  we do not\n                                           \n\nconsider   a  particularly   effective  notice   vehicle  for\n\n                             -17-\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.  The  regulations, however, require\n\nonly a  publication \"of  general circulation in  the judicial\n\ndistrict in  which the . .  . forfeiture is brought,\"  and we\n\nfind no violation of due process in this regard.  21 C.F.R.  \n\n1316.75(a).  The government's conduct  simply did not rise to\n\na violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nB.   Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction\n                                       \n\n          We next  review the district  court's dismissal  of\n\nthe case on  the basis that it lost jurisdiction  to hear the\n\nremaining Fourth  Amendment claim  once the notice  issue was\n\nresolved  against  plaintiffs.    This  issue  poses  a  pure\n\nquestion  of  law.   Therefore,  our  standard of  review  is\n\nplenary.   See Liberty Mutual  Ins. Co.  v.

Whereas\n\nmost  challenges  to  forfeiture  would be  foreclosed  by  a\n\n                    \n\n5   Administrative  Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C.    702, provides\nin pertinent part:\n\n     A  person suffering legal  wrong because  of agency\n     action,  or  adversely  affected  or  aggrieved  by\n     agency  action within  the  meaning of  a  relevant\n     statute,  is entitled  to judicial  review thereof.\n     An action in  a court of the  United States seeking\n     relief other than money damages and stating a claim\n     that an  agency or  an officer or  employee thereof\n     acted or failed  to act in an official  capacity or\n     under  color  of  legal   authority  shall  not  be\n     dismissed  nor  relief  therein  be  denied  on the\n     ground that it is  against the United States .  . .\n     Nothing  herein  (1) affects  other  limitations on\n     judicial review or the  power or duty of the  court\n     to dismiss any  action or deny relief  on any other\n     appropriate  legal  or  equitable  ground;  or  (2)\n     confers  authority to  grant  relief  if any  other\n     statute that  grants consent to  suit expressly  or\n     impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\n\n                             -19-\n\nplaintiffs' failure to  utilize the  mechanism for  obtaining\n\njudicial  relief  provided  in  the  forfeiture  statute  and\n\nregulations,  courts  have   entertained  challenges  to  the\n\nadequacy  of  notice, reasoning  that  the  mechanism is  not\n\navailable  to a plaintiff who is not properly notified of the\n\npending  forfeiture.

Concluding   that  the\n\nforfeiture statute was a \"statute\" which \"preclude[d] review\"\n\nunder    701(a)(1), because the statutory  scheme provided an\n\navenue for judicial relief,  the district court dismissed the\n\ncase.\n\n          The  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  assessing\n\nwhether Congress  intends to  preclude  judicial review,  the\n\n                             -20-\n\nintention  need not be found  in the express  language of the\n\nstatute, but should  be determined from the structure  of the\n\nstatutory  scheme and  from  its objectives.

The\n                          \n\ndistrict court correctly interpreted   701(a)(1) to find that\n\nthe  forfeiture statute  precluded  judicial  review in  this\n\ncase.\n\n          Plaintiffs  ask  us  to  extend the  exception  for\n\nconstitutionally deficient notice to hear the merits of their\n\nFifth  Amendment claim.  It  is their position  that, even if\n\nthe notice  was constitutionally  adequate, it still  was not\n                                          \n\neffective.  In practical terms, plaintiffs claim, they had no\n         \n\nknowledge of  the deadlines for filing a cost bond.  Absent a\n\nlegal defect  in the notice,  however, we cannot  correct any\n\nresidual  ineffectiveness  if  such  there be,  by  extending\n\njurisdiction  where Congress  has  spoken otherwise.     Once\n\nagain,   we  are  sympathetic   with  plaintiffs'  frustrated\n\nattempts to obtain a hearing on the merits.  We are, however,\n\nbound  by the  rule of  law and  the adversary  process.
