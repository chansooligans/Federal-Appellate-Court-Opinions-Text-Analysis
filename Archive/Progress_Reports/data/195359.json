This appeal  arises out  of an\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\naction  brought pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.    1983 (1988).    In it,\n\nappellants strive to convince us that the district court erred in\n\ngranting   summary  judgment  in   favor  of   defendants  Ismael\n\nBetancourt-Lebron (sometimes  referred to as  Ismael Betancourt y\n\nLebron) and  Carlos J. Lopez-Feliciano.  Although we are troubled\n\nby the district court's  action expediting the appeal  under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 54(b), we affirm the entry of summary judgment.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                      Statement of the Case\n                                           \n\n          In  the early  morning hours  of February  15, 1991,  a\n\npolice officer, Jose M. Colon-Burgos, allegedly shot and killed a\n\nyoung man,  Manuel E.  Maldonado-Irizarry, in  the line of  duty.\n\nThe  decedent's    family  members, appellants  here,  brought  a\n\nsection  1983 suit in which they claimed, inter alia, that Colon-\n                                                    \n\nBurgos  used excessive  force;  that the  homicide constituted  a\n\nwrongful  deprivation of  the decedent's  civil rights;  and that\n\nother law enforcement officers conspired to hide the truth.\n\n          In  mounting  this  offensive,  appellants  cut  a wide\n\nswath;  they sued  Colon-Burgos,  several of  his confreres,  and\n\ncertain high-ranking  officials who  had no direct  connection to\n\nthe shooting or  its aftermath.   Betancourt-Lebron, who was  the\n\nsuperintendent of  police when the incident  occurred, and Lopez-\n\nFeliciano,  the  former  superintendent,  fell into  this  latter\n\n                                2\n\ngroup.1   Appellants alleged in substance  that Betancourt-Lebron\n\ndid  not adequately  supervise  officers under  his command,  and\n\nthereby exhibited deliberate indifference to the proper discharge\n\nof  his  duties.    Lopez-Feliciano,  appellants said,  exhibited\n\nsimilar indifference during his tenure as superintendent, and, in\n\naddition, failed properly to train members of the police force.\n\n          On  February  22,  1993,  Betancourt-Lebron  moved  for\n\nsummary   judgment  on   appellants'  third   amended  complaint.\n\nAppellants requested,  and received, several extensions  of time.\n\nEventually, they  tendered an  opposition.   On  June 25,  Lopez-\n\nFeliciano moved for  summary judgment.  Appellants  did not serve\n\nan  opposition, but,  instead, requested  a further  extension of\n\ntime within which  to respond.   On July  13, the district  court\n\ndenied the motion for  more time, and, eight days  later, granted\n\nboth Rule 56 motions.2  This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                      Appellate Jurisdiction\n                                            \n\n          Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  54(b)  permits  the entry  of  final\n\njudgment  as to fewer than all the  parties or claims in a multi-\n\nparty  action,  thus  clearing  the  way  for  earlier-than-usual\n\nappeals, \"upon  an express determination  that there  is no  just\n\n                    \n\n     1Lopez-Feliciano  served as  superintendent  of police  from\nearly 1986 until he resigned effective December 31, 1988.  He had\nno official standing on February 15, 1991.\n\n     2At the same time, the lower court entered the July 13 order\non the docket and granted a motion to dismiss that had been filed\non behalf of another  high-ranking official, defendant Aida Myrna\nVelez.  Appellants have  not ventured an appeal from  this aspect\nof the court's order.\n\n                                3\n\nreason  for  delay\" in  entering judgment.3    In this  case, the\n\ndistrict court made  the requisite finding and  directed entry of\n\njudgment notwithstanding  that the action  remained unadjudicated\n\nas to numerous other parties.\n\n          The  court  focused  on  the  existence  of  a  special\n\ncircumstance:  one of the defendants, Reinaldo Castillo-Rodriguez\n\n(Castillo),  had  declared bankruptcy,  triggering  the automatic\n\nstay, 11 U.S.C.   362; the case, the court felt, would likely \"be\n\ndormant for a number  of months pending the disposition  of [the]\n\nbankruptcy  matter\";  and, therefore,  it  would  \"save time\"  to\n\npermit  the  appeal  to  go  forward  \"while  the  issue  of  the\n\nbankruptcy  stay  was  addressed  before  the  bankruptcy court.\"\n\nBecause this  determination implicates  the existence vel  non of\n                                                              \n\nappellate jurisdiction,  we must satisfy ourselves concerning its\n\ncorrectness even though the  parties have acquiesced in it.   See\n                                                                 \n\nSpiegel  v. Trustees of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38,  43 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1988); United States General,  Inc. v.

R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n                                4\n\nwith Rule 54(b) determinations.  See Geiselman v. United  States,\n                                                                \n\n961 F.2d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct.\n                                                     \n\n261  (1992); Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 44\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); Spiegel,  853 F.2d at 42-43.   First, the ruling\n                        \n\nunderlying the  proposed  judgment must  itself be  final in  the\n\nsense  that it disposes completely either of all claims against a\n\ngiven defendant or of  some discrete substantive claim or  set of\n\nclaims against the  defendants generally.  See Spiegel,  843 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat  43.  That requirement  plainly is satisfied  here; the orders\n\ngranting brevis disposition terminated appellants' claims against\n               \n\nBetancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano in their entirety.\n\n          The  second step  of  the Spiegel  pavane is  harder to\n                                           \n\nmaster.   It requires  tracing the interrelationship  between, on\n\none  hand, the legal and factual basis of the claims undergirding\n\nthe proposed judgment (i.e.,  the jettisoned claims), and on  the\n                           \n\nother hand, the legal  and factual basis of the  claims remaining\n\nin the case.  See id.  Once the court of appeals has prepared the\n                     \n\nnecessary schematic,  it must then  ponder the balance  struck by\n\nthe district  court between the desirability  of immediate review\n\nand  the  undesirability of  promoting  piecemeal  appeals.   See\n                                                                 \n\nKersey v.  Dennison Mfg.  Co., 3 F.3d  482, 486 (1st  Cir. 1993);\n                             \n\nMorrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981)\n                              \n\n(Kennedy, J.).\n\n          Here, the second half  of the Spiegel paradigm presents\n                                               \n\na borderline  question.   Appellants  sued Betancourt-Lebron  and\n\nLopez-Feliciano    for    improperly   discharging    supervisory\n\n                                5\n\nresponsibilities in ways that  led to the decedent's death.   But\n\nadjudicating  those claims  necessitates  an  exploration of  the\n\nfacts concerning  the shooting and  alleged coverup.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nVoutour  v. Vitale, 761 F.2d  812, 820-21 (1st  Cir. 1985), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  474  U.S. 1100  (1986).   Thus,  there is  a significant\n      \n\nimbrication between  the  jettisoned  claims  and  the  remaining\n\nclaims.   District courts should go very slowly in employing Rule\n\n54(b) when, as in this instance, the factual underpinnings of the\n\nadjudicated  and  unadjudicated  claims  are  intertwined.    See\n                                                                 \n\nSpiegel, 843 F.2d at 45.\n       \n\n          We think, too, that  the Rule 54(b) determination rests\n\non shaky ground  for other reasons.  In  the first place, whether\n\nthe  record is scanned from the standpoint of the plaintiffs, the\n\ndefendants,  or  the  court,  it  discloses  no urgent  need  for\n\nimmediate  review.  In the  second place, trial  of the remaining\n\nclaims  has  the potential  of mooting  the issue  of supervisory\n\nliability and  rendering further appellate review  of the summary\n\njudgment order superfluous.  Given these circumstances, and given\n\nthe  \"long-settled  and  prudential  policy  against  scattershot\n\n[appeals],\"  id. at 42, the  rush to enter  an immediate judgment\n                \n\nstrikes us as problematic.\n\n          To be sure, the scales are not entirely out of balance.\n\nThe judgment did  dispose fully of all claims  against a group of\n\nparties   appellees and Velez    and those claims raised a set of\n\nunique issues.  And, moreover, the district court had an arguably\n\nplausible reason     the  enforced  stay  of  litigation  on  the\n\n                                6\n\ndistrict  court level     for resorting  to  Rule 54(b).    These\n\nfactors tend to  balance out,  to some extent,  the factors  that\n\ncounsel in favor of a more deliberate approach.\n\n          While we,  if writing  on a  pristine page, would  have\n\naccorded greater weight to considerations of judicial economy and\n\nthe importance of  discouraging broadly piecemeal  appeals, three\n\nthings  persuade  us to  allow  the Rule  54(b)  determination to\n\nstand:  first, the  special circumstance  presented by  the stay;\n\nsecond, the differences, both legal and factual, that distinguish\n\nthe claims against  appellees from the  claims against the  other\n\ndefendants; and  third, the deference  owed to the  trial court's\n\ndeterminations under  Rule 54(b), see  Spiegel, 843  F.2d at  42.\n                                              \n\nAlthough the call is excruciatingly close, we are not prepared to\n\nsay that the court below overstepped the bounds of its discretion\n\nhere.4\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                  The Summary Judgment Standard\n                                               \n\n          Summary  judgment  is  permissible  when  \"there is  no\n\ngenuine issue  as to any material fact and . . . the moving party\n\nis  entitled to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"  Fed.

We\n\nhave described that rhythm in the following way:\n\n          The   movant  must  put  the  ball  in  play,\n          averring  \"an absence of  evidence to support\n          the nonmoving party's case.\"  The burden then\n          shifts  to  the  nonmovant to  establish  the\n          existence of at least one fact issue which is\n          both \"genuine\" and  \"material.\"  A  \"genuine\"\n          issue is  one \"that properly can  be resolved\n          only  by a  finder of  fact because  [it] may\n          reasonably  be  resolved in  favor  of either\n          party.\"  Put another  way, a \"genuine\"  issue\n          exists  if  there  is   \"sufficient  evidence\n          supporting  the  claimed factual  dispute\" to\n          require  a  choice   between  \"the   parties'\n          differing versions of the truth at trial.\"  A\n          \"material\" issue is  one that \"affect[s]  the\n          outcome  of  the  suit,\"  that is,  an  issue\n          which,  perforce,  \"need[s]  to  be  resolved\n          before   the  related  legal  issues  can  be\n          decided.\" \n\nGarside  v.

See  Anderson, 477\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  249-50; Pagano  v. Frank,  983 F.2d  343, 348 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1993).

See Oklahoma\n                                                                 \n\nCity v. Tuttle,  471 U.S. 808,  823-24 (1985).   Thus, even if  a\n              \n\nsupervisor lacks  actual knowledge of censurable  conduct, he may\n\nbe  liable for the foreseeable consequences of such conduct if he\n\nwould have known  of it  but for his  deliberate indifference  or\n\nwillful  blindness,  and if  he had  the  power and  authority to\n\nalleviate it.  See Miranda v.  Munoz, 770 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1985);  DiMarzo v.

See, e.g., City of Canton v.\n                                                              \n\nHarris,  489 U.S.  378, 388  (1989); Manarite,  957 F.2d  at 957;\n                                             \n\nGutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562; see also Rivas v.

Deliberate indifference,\n\nhowever,  is not  the be-all  and the  end-all of a  section 1983\n\nclaim premised on  supervisory liability.   As we explain  below,\n\nthere is a causation element as well.\n\n          To  succeed  on   a  supervisory  liability  claim,   a\n\nplaintiff  not  only must  show  deliberate  indifference or  its\n\nequivalent, but also must affirmatively connect the  supervisor's\n\n                                10\n\nconduct to  the subordinate's  violative  act or  omission.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBowen, 966  F.2d at 20; Lewis  v.

This  causation requirement\n                 \n\ncan  be  satisfied even  if  the supervisor  did  not participate\n\ndirectly  in the conduct  that violated  a citizen's  rights; for\n\nexample, a sufficient casual nexus may be found if the supervisor\n\nknew of, overtly or tacitly approved of, or purposely disregarded\n\nthe conduct.   See, e.g., Larez v. Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 646\n                                              \n\n(9th Cir. 1991); Lipsett  v.

Consequently,  deliberate\n\nindifference to violations of constitutional rights can forge the\n\nnecessary linkage  between the  acts or omissions  of supervisory\n\npersonnel  and  the  misconduct   of  their  subordinates.    See\n                                                                 \n\nGaudreault v.

Ct. 2266 (1991).\n      \n\n          A  causal link  may also  be forged  if there  exists a\n\nknown  history   of  widespread  abuse  sufficient   to  alert  a\n\nsupervisor  to ongoing  violations.   When the  supervisor is  on\n\nnotice  and fails  to  take  corrective  action, say,  by  better\n\ntraining or closer oversight, liability may attach.  See Brown v.\n                                                              \n\nCrawford, 906 F.2d 667,  671 (11th Cir. 1990), cert.  denied, 111\n                                                            \n\nS.

See  Tuttle,  471  U.S.  at  823-24;\n                                        \n\n                                11\n\nRodriquez v.

By\n\nlike token, proof of mere negligence, without more, is inadequate\n\nto  ground  supervisory  liability.     See  Febus-Rodrigues   v.\n                                                            \n\nBetancourt-Lebron, 14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 1994); Haynesworth v.\n                                                              \n\nMiller, 820 F.2d 1245,  1261 (D.C. Cir. 1987).   Gross negligence\n      \n\ncan signify  deliberate indifference  and  serve as  a basis  for\n\nsupervisory liability if it is  causally connected to the actions\n\nthat work  the direct constitutional  injury.   See Voutour,  761\n                                                           \n\nF.2d at 820.  Hence, inadequate training of subordinates may be a\n\nbasis for a section 1983 claim against a  superior officer.

We, therefore,\n\nbifurcate our analysis.  We begin with  Betancourt-Lebron, but we\n\ndo not linger long.  The nisi prius roll discloses no evidence on\n                                   \n\nwhich  a claim  of supervisory  liability against  that defendant\n\nmight properly be predicated.\n\n                                12\n\n          To be  sure, the record contains evidence  from which a\n\njury reasonably  could conclude  that the remaining  defendants  \n\nthe police  officers allegedly involved  in the shooting  and the\n\ncoverup   abridged  the decedent's civil rights.  But appellants'\n\nattempts  to  link  Betancourt-Lebron  to  these  activities  are\n\nimpuissant.  There is no competent proof of actual participation,\n\nor of a policy of tolerating similar violations, or of deliberate\n\nindifference.   Nor  is there  proof of  a pattern  of misconduct\n\nsufficient  to  put  the  superintendent  of  police  on  inquiry\n\nnotice.5\n\n          In  sum,  considering  the  record in  the  light  most\n\ncongenial  to appellants,  we  can find  only tenuous  assertions\n\nstrung together by strands  of speculation and surmise.   More is\n\nrequired to survive summary  judgment.  See Fragoso, 991  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n887; Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8.  Supervisory liability attaches\n                 \n\nonly if a  plaintiff can demonstrate  by material of  evidentiary\n\nquality an affirmative link  between the supervisor's conduct and\n\nthe underlying section 1983 violation.  See Bowen 966 F.2d at 20;\n                                                 \n\nPinto, 737 F.2d at 132.  Here, the record is bereft of any proof,\n     \n\n                    \n\n     5Appellants   did   proffer   two  previous   administrative\ncomplaints,   one  naming  Colon-Burgos   and  the  other  naming\nCastillo.   These complaints have  only marginal relevance to the\nclaims at issue  in this  appeal.  The  complaint against  Colon-\nBurgos  relates to his conduct during an alleged dispute with his\nformer mother-in-law.  The  complaint against Castillo relates to\nhis alleged \ndiscourteousness in  refusing to return  a firearm to  its owner.\nThere is  absolutely no  connection between these  complaints and\nthe  charges levelled  against  the officers  in  this case.    A\n                                                                 \nfortiori,  there  is no  connection  between  the complaints  and\n        \nappellants' claims against the appellees.\n\n                                13\n\ndirect  or  inferential, of  a  causal  link between  Betancourt-\n\nLebron's activities and the alleged deprivation of constitutional\n\nrights.

Thus,  the  question presented  in respect  to this\n\nmotion is not a matter of evidentiary sufficiency but a matter of\n\nprocedural orthodoxy.\n\n          We start  with first  principles.   A  trial court  may\n\nenlarge the time for responding to motions, including motions for\n\nsummary  judgment.7  See, e.g., United  States v.

We deem\n   \n\nit self-evident  that \"appellate courts cannot  too readily agree\n\nto  meddle  in  such  case-management decisions  lest  the  trial\n\ncourt's authority  be undermined and  the systems sputter.\"   Id.\n                                                                 \n\nHowever,  there   are  few,  if  any,   guidelines  beyond  these\n\nabecedarian principles, for decisions about  whether enlargements\n\nof time are warranted tend to be case specific.\n\n          The  facts surrounding  the Rule  6(b) dispute  in this\n\ncase are simple.  Lopez-Feliciano  moved for summary judgment  on\n\nFriday, June  25, 1993.   Under prevailing  practice, appellants'\n\nresponse was  due within  ten days.   See  D.P.R. Loc.  R. 311.5,\n                                         \n\n311.12.   On  Friday, July  2,  appellants' counsel  advised  the\n\ncourt, by  means of an informative  motion, that he  would \"be on\n\nvacation leave from July 3, 1993 until August 6, 1993.\"   On July\n\n6,  after counsel had left  for Europe, appellants  for the first\n\ntime  requested, in a curt, two-paragraph  motion, that the court\n\nextend the time for  filing their opposition to Lopez-Feliciano's\n\nsummary  judgment  initiative  until late  August.    Appellants'\n\nmotion  alleged,  in a  purely  conclusory  fashion, that  Lopez-\n\n                    \n\n          was the result of excusable neglect . . . . \n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).\n\n                                15\n\nFeliciano's motion \"contained  voluminous exhibits and  questions\n\nof  law   which  require   an  additional   time  to   study  and\n\ninvestigate.\"\n\n          On July 13, the  district court denied the sought-after\n\nextension.    The  court  noted that  it  had  \"patiently granted\n\nseveral requests  of this nature [for appellants' benefit] in the\n\npast,\" and indicated that it could not justify \"continu[ing] [to]\n\n[allow] . . . delay  in the disposition of pending matters.\"   No\n\nopposition  was   ever  filed,  and  the   court  granted  brevis\n                                                                 \n\ndisposition in Lopez-Feliciano's favor on July 21.\n\n          It is important to  pin down what this appeal  does not\n\ninvolve.   Appellants  did  not, by  affidavit or  other proffer,\n\ninvoke  Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(f),8 claiming, say,  that they needed\n\nmore  time for additional  discovery.  By  like token, appellants\n\ndid not advert to any circumstances beyond their control, such as\n\nan  attorney's  illness,  to  justify  an  enlargement  of  time.\n\nRather, they  sought the extension primarily  for the convenience\n\n                    \n\n     8The rule reads:\n\n          Should  it appear  from the  affidavits  of a\n          party  opposing  the   motion  [for   summary\n          judgment] that the  party cannot for  reasons\n          stated present by  affidavit facts  essential\n          to justify the party's opposition,  the court\n          may  refuse the  application for  judgment or\n          may order a  continuance to permit affidavits\n          to be obtained or  depositions to be taken or\n          discovery to  be had  or may make  such other\n          order as is just.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n                                16\n\nof counsel, who wished to take a leisurely vacation.9\n\n          Viewed in this  light, the ruling is  supportable.  The\n\njudge, not counsel, must run the  court and set the agenda.  This\n\nentails  establishing reasonable  time  parameters  and  ensuring\n\ncompliance with them.   Reversing the roles of court  and counsel\n\nwould invite chaos.  See de  la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15\n                                                             \n\nF.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.  1994); Higuera v. Pueblo Int'l,  Inc., 585\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 555, 557 (1st Cir.  1978).  Consequently, it will be  a rare\n\ncase in which  an appellate court  will fault a  trial judge  for\n\nrefusing  to  elevate  counsel's  convenience over  the  need  to\n\nmaintain  respect for court rules that require filings to be made\n\nwithin a  set time  frame.  As  we acknowledged  in an  analogous\n\nsituation,  \"a  district judge  often  must be  firm  in managing\n\ncrowded dockets  and demanding adherence to announced deadlines.\"\n\nMendez, 900 F.2d at 7.\n      \n\n          Of  course,  judges  are   not  tinpot  dictators,  and\n\nfirmness  must  not be  confused with  tyranny.   But,  here, the\n\ndenial of  appellants' Rule 6(b) motion,  silhouetted against the\n\nhistorical background of the case, seems reasonable, not despotic\n\nor even arbitrary.  Two  circumstances are of particular interest\n\nin this regard.\n\n                    \n\n     9Indeed,  given the  wholly conclusory  nature of  the other\nreasons advanced in  the July 6  motion, the plethoric  discovery\nalready completed,  and the similarity  between Lopez-Feliciano's\nmotion  and   the  summary  judgment  motion   filed  earlier  by\nBetancourt-Lebron  (to which  appellants had  already responded),\nthere  was ample  room for  the district  court to  conclude that\ncounsel's  convenience  comprised  the  only  impetus  behind the\n                                            \nextension request.\n\n                                17\n\n          First,   the  disputed  extension  request  came  after\n\nappellants trespassed  on the court's indulgence  many times over\n\nmany months, e.g., amending  the complaint three times, obtaining\n                 \n\nat  least five enlargements of time to oppose earlier motions for\n\nsummary   judgment,   and   successfully  rescheduling   pretrial\n\nconferences on no fewer than four occasions.\n\n          Second, appellants' lawyer exhibited meager respect for\n\nthe  court.  Although his European respite had been planned since\n\nMarch, the lawyer  filed his informative motion  at the beginning\n\nof  July and  filed the  extension request  three days  after his\n\nactual departure.   Appellants' only excuse  for this discourtesy\n\nrings hollow.   They  point out  that, on June  18, they  filed a\n\nrequest to postpone  the pretrial conference,  then set for  July\n\n20, on the ground that their counsel \"will be in Europe from July\n\n3, 1993  until August 6,  1993.\"  On  July 1, the  district court\n\ngranted  the  request,  shifting  the conference  to  August  17.\n\nAppellants  contend  that their  request necessarily  alerted the\n\ncourt to counsel's vacation  plans, and that the granting  of the\n\nrequest lulled  them into  believing  that the  court would  work\n\naround counsel's absence.\n\n          This  contention will  not  wash.   For one  thing, the\n\ndistrict court did  not act on  the request  until July 1;  thus,\n\nappellants could not have placed  any meaningful reliance on  the\n\ngranting of the  request.   This lack of  reliance is  adequately\n\nevinced by  appellants' subsequent filing, in  rapid sequence, of\n\nthe informative motion  and the  Rule 6(b) motion.   For  another\n\n                                18\n\nthing,  the June 18 request  did not fairly  apprise the district\n\ncourt of the  overall situation.  Appellants  limited the request\n\nto the timing of the pretrial conference.   The fact that counsel\n\nwished personally  to attend  that proceeding shed  no definitive\n\nlight  upon  his  intentions  vis-a-vis  more  mundane   matters.\n\nIndeed,  since the request did  not mention other  aspects of the\n\nlitigation,  the court  reasonably could  infer that  counsel had\n\nmade  suitable arrangements  and  would not  require any  special\n\ndispensation in regard to motion practice, discovery proceedings,\n\nand the like.\n\n          The  issue does  not  require further  elaboration.   A\n\npetition  for a continuance is  always suspect when  it is within\n\nthe  power  of  the  petitioner  to  alter  the  conditions  that\n\nallegedly preclude him from acting within the  allotted period of\n\ntime.   Here,  appellants can  identify nothing that  suffices to\n\ndispel this  cloud.  And a  variety of other factors  support the\n\nreasonableness  of  the   district  court's  action  in   holding\n\nappellants to the  rule:  the filing  of Lopez-Feliciano's motion\n\nfor summary judgment  came as no  surprise; appellants had  ample\n\nopportunity      including  roughly  eight  days  before  counsel\n\ndeparted   within which to respond to it; they had the benefit of\n\nample discovery, rendering it unlikely that a further opportunity\n\nto submit additional materials  would have influenced the outcome\n\nof  the case;  and, finally,  they failed  to file  a  Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion.    This  omission  speaks  volumes.   Litigants  who  are\n\nunprepared to respond in  a timely manner to motions  for summary\n\n                                19\n\njudgment cannot  be encouraged  or  permitted to  essay end  runs\n\naround the substantial requirements of Rule 56(f).  See generally\n                                                                 \n\nPaterson-Leitch Co. v.  Massachusetts Mun.  Wholesale Elec.  Co.,\n                                                                \n\n840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing requirements).\n\n          When all is said and done, the district court's refusal\n\nto  grant the  requested  extension comes  down  to a  matter  of\n\ndiscretion.   The test for abuse of discretion is well settled in\n\nthis circuit, see, e.g.,  United States v. Roberts, 978  F.2d 17,\n                                                   \n\n21  (1st Cir. 1992); Independent  Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v.  Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg.  Co., 864 F.2d 927,  929 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1988), and does  not bear  reiteration.  Applying  this test,  we\n\nconclude that,  though the district court's  decision perhaps can\n\nbe  characterized  as tough-minded,  the  court  made no  obvious\n\nmistake  either  in  isolating  or in  weighing  the  appropriate\n\nfactors.  While attorneys are entitled to take vacations, a trial\n\nlawyer  who  wishes  to  plan  a  lengthy  pleasure  trip  has  a\n\ncorresponding obligation to advise the judge and opposing counsel\n\nwell in  advance, and to  make appropriate arrangements  for case\n\ncoverage in his absence.  When, as now, an attorney fails to take\n\nelementary  precautions, and  the trial  court declines  to alter\n\ncourse,  an  appellate  tribunal  should  not  interfere  without\n\ncompelling  reason.   After  all, \"[r]ules  are  rules    and the\n\nparties  must  play by  them.\"   Mendez, 900  F.2d  at 7.   Here,\n                                       \n\nappellants  have  articulated  no   plausible  basis  for  us  to\n\nintervene.\n\n          Our conclusion that  the district court did not  err in\n\n                                20\n\ndenying appellants' Rule 6(b) motion ends our inquiry. Appellants\n\noffer  no developed  argumentation  to demonstrate  that, on  the\n\nrecord as  it stands, summary  judgment could have  been avoided.\n\nThe point is, therefore, effectively conceded.  See Ryan v. Royal\n                                                                 \n\nIns.

The judgment in favor of Lopez-Feliciano must\n\nstand.\n\n                               VII.\n                                   \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We need go no further.  Having examined the record with\n\ncare, we are satisfied that the appeal is properly before us.  In\n\nthe exercise of that discerned jurisdiction, we conclude that the\n\ncourt below did not err either in denying appellants further time\n\nor in granting appellees' motions for summary judgment.  Although\n\nthe rhetoric of supervisory liability reverberates from the pages\n\nof  appellants'  briefs,  the  record  contains  no  evidence  of\n\nculpability sufficient  to relate the rhetoric to  the reality of\n\nevents.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                  Concurring opinion follows  \n\n                                21\n\n          BOWNES,  J., separately  concurring.

Sec. 1983 (1988).  In it, appellants strive to convince us that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants Ismael Betancourt-Lebron (sometimes referred to as Ismael Betancourt y Lebron) and Carlos J. Lopez-Feliciano.  Although we are troubled by the district court's action expediting the appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), we affirm the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Statement of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of February 15, 1991, a police officer, Jose M. Colon-Burgos, allegedly shot and killed a young man, Manuel E. Maldonado-Irizarry, in the line of duty.  The decedent's family members, appellants here, brought a section 1983 suit in which they claimed, inter alia, that Colon-Burgos used excessive force;  that the homicide constituted a wrongful deprivation of the decedent's civil rights;  and that other law enforcement officers conspired to hide the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting this offensive, appellants cut a wide swath;  they sued Colon-Burgos, several of his confreres, and certain high-ranking officials who had no direct connection to the shooting or its aftermath.  Betancourt-Lebron, who was the superintendent of police when the incident occurred, and Lopez-Feliciano, the former superintendent, fell into this latter group.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellants alleged in substance that Betancourt-Lebron did not adequately supervise officers under his command, and thereby exhibited deliberate indifference to the proper discharge of his duties.  Lopez-Feliciano, appellants said, exhibited similar indifference during his tenure as superintendent, and, in addition, failed properly to train members of the police force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 1993, Betancourt-Lebron moved for summary judgment on appellants' third amended complaint.  Appellants requested, and received, several extensions of time.  Eventually, they tendered an opposition.  On June 25, Lopez-Feliciano moved for summary judgment.  Appellants did not serve an opposition, but, instead, requested a further extension of time within which to respond.  On July 13, the district court denied the motion for more time, and, eight days later, granted both Rule 56 motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) permits the entry of final judgment as to fewer than all the parties or claims in a multi-party action, thus clearing the way for earlier-than-usual appeals, \"upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay\" in entering judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In this case, the district court made the requisite finding and directed entry of judgment notwithstanding that the action remained unadjudicated as to numerous other parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court focused on the existence of a special circumstance:  one of the defendants, Reinaldo Castillo-Rodriguez (Castillo), had declared bankruptcy, triggering the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362;  the case, the court felt, would likely \"be dormant for a number of months pending the disposition of [the] bankruptcy matter\";  and, therefore, it would \"save time\" to permit the appeal to go forward \"while the issue of the bankruptcy stay was addressed before the bankruptcy court.\"   Because this determination implicates the existence vel non of appellate jurisdiction, we must satisfy ourselves concerning its correctness even though the parties have acquiesced in it.  See Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1988);  United States General, Inc. v. Albert, 792 F.2d 678, 680 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has used a two-step approach in connection with Rule 54(b) determinations.  See Geiselman v. United States, 961 F.2d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir.)  (per curiam), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 261, 121 L.Ed.2d 191 (1992);  Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 44 (1st Cir.1991);  Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 42-43.   First, the ruling underlying the proposed judgment must itself be final in the sense that it disposes completely either of all claims against a given defendant or of some discrete substantive claim or set of claims against the defendants generally.  See Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 43.   That requirement plainly is satisfied here;  the orders granting brevis disposition terminated appellants' claims against Betancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step of the Spiegel pavane is harder to master.  It requires tracing the interrelationship between, on one hand, the legal and factual basis of the claims undergirding the proposed judgment (i.e., the jettisoned claims), and on the other hand, the legal and factual basis of the claims remaining in the case.  See id.   Once the court of appeals has prepared the necessary schematic, it must then ponder the balance struck by the district court between the desirability of immediate review and the undesirability of promoting piecemeal appeals.  See Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 486 (1st Cir.1993);  Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir.1981) (Kennedy, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the second half of the Spiegel paradigm presents a borderline question.  Appellants sued Betancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano for improperly discharging supervisory responsibilities in ways that led to the decedent's death.  But adjudicating those claims necessitates an exploration of the facts concerning the shooting and alleged coverup.  See, e.g., Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 820-21 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1100, 106 S.Ct. 879, 88 L.Ed.2d 916 (1986).  Thus, there is a significant imbrication between the jettisoned claims and the remaining claims.  District courts should go very slowly in employing Rule 54(b) when, as in this instance, the factual underpinnings of the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims are intertwined.  See Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the Rule 54(b) determination rests on shaky ground for other reasons.  In the first place, whether the record is scanned from the standpoint of the plaintiffs, the defendants, or the court, it discloses no urgent need for immediate review.  In the second place, trial of the remaining claims has the potential of mooting the issue of supervisory liability and rendering further appellate review of the summary judgment order superfluous.  Given these circumstances, and given the \"long-settled and prudential policy against scattershot [appeals],\" id. at 42, the rush to enter an immediate judgment strikes us as problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the scales are not entirely out of balance.  The judgment did dispose fully of all claims against a group of parties--appellees and Velez--and those claims raised a set of unique issues.  And, moreover, the district court had an arguably plausible reason--the enforced stay of litigation on the district court level--for resorting to Rule 54(b).  These factors tend to balance out, to some extent, the factors that counsel in favor of a more deliberate approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we, if writing on a pristine page, would have accorded greater weight to considerations of judicial economy and the importance of discouraging broadly piecemeal appeals, three things persuade us to allow the Rule 54(b) determination to stand:  first, the special circumstance presented by the stay;  second, the differences, both legal and factual, that distinguish the claims against appellees from the claims against the other defendants;  and third, the deference owed to the trial court's determinations under Rule 54(b), see Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 42.   Although the call is excruciatingly close, we are not prepared to say that the court below overstepped the bounds of its discretion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is permissible when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, see Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir.1989), scrutinizing the entire record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant and indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  See Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir.1989);  Mack v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment practice has a rhythm of its own.  We have described that rhythm in the following way:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The movant must put the ball in play, averring \"an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\"   The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to establish the existence of at least one fact issue which is both \"genuine\" and \"material.\"   A \"genuine\" issue is one \"that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because [it] may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\"   Put another way, a \"genuine\" issue exists if there is \"sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute\" to require a choice between \"the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial.\"   A \"material\" issue is one that \"affect[s] the outcome of the suit,\" that is, an issue which, perforce, \"need[s] to be resolved before the related legal issues can be decided.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990) (citing and quoting, inter alia, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), and Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (other citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On issues as to which the nonmovant bears the ultimate burden of proof, he may not defeat a properly focused motion for summary judgment by relying upon mere allegations or evidence that is less than significantly probative.  See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. at 2510-11;  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 348 (1st Cir.1993).  Put another way, a party opposing summary judgment must \"present definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992);  accord Fragoso v. Lopez, 991 F.2d 878, 887 (1st Cir.1993).  Thus, summary judgment likely will be appropriate if the nonmovant elects to rest upon some combination of \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"  Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another important dimension to summary judgment practice:  motions for summary judgment must be decided on the record as it stands, not on litigants' visions of what the facts might some day reveal.  As we have warned, \"[b]rash conjecture, coupled with earnest hope that something concrete will eventually materialize, is insufficient to block summary judgment.\"  Dow v.

Sec. 1983 on a respondeat superior theory, see Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978);  Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir.1989), he may be found liable under section 1983 on the basis of his own acts or omissions, see Bowen v. Manchester, 966 F.2d 13, 20 (1st Cir.1992); Manarite v. Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 957 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992);  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way in which a supervisor's behavior may come within this rule is by formulating a policy, or engaging in a custom, that leads to the challenged occurrence.  See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823-24, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2436-37, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985).  Thus, even if a supervisor lacks actual knowledge of censurable conduct, he may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of such conduct if he would have known of it but for his deliberate indifference or willful blindness, and if he had the power and authority to alleviate it.  See Miranda v. Munoz, 770 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1985);  Dimarzo v. Cahill, 575 F.2d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 927, 99 S.Ct. 312, 58 L.Ed.2d 320 (1978);  cf. Pinto v. Nettleship, 737 F.2d 130, 132 (1st Cir.1984) (barring liability under Sec. 1983 for actions beyond supervisor-defendant's control).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this rubric, a supervisor may be held liable for what he does (or fails to do) if his behavior demonstrates deliberate indifference to conduct that is itself violative of a plaintiff's constitutional rights.  See, e.g., City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989);  Manarite, 957 F.2d at 957;  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562;  see also Rivas v. Freeman, 940 F.2d 1491, 1495 (11th Cir.1991).  Deliberate indifference, however, is not the be-all and the end-all of a section 1983 claim premised on supervisory liability.  As we explain below, there is a causation element as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on a supervisory liability claim, a plaintiff not only must show deliberate indifference or its equivalent, but also must affirmatively connect the supervisor's conduct to the subordinate's violative act or omission.  See Bowen, 966 F.2d at 20;  Lewis v. Smith, 855 F.2d 736, 738 (11th Cir.1988);  Pinto, 737 F.2d at 132.   This causation requirement can be satisfied even if the supervisor did not participate directly in the conduct that violated a citizen's rights;  for example, a sufficient casual nexus may be found if the supervisor knew of, overtly or tacitly approved of, or purposely disregarded the conduct.  See, e.g., Larez v. Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 646 (9th Cir.1991);  Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 902-03 (1st Cir.1988).  Consequently, deliberate indifference to violations of constitutional rights can forge the necessary linkage between the acts or omissions of supervisory personnel and the misconduct of their subordinates.  See Gaudreault v. Salem, 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 956, 111 S.Ct. 2266, 114 L.Ed.2d 718 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A causal link may also be forged if there exists a known history of widespread abuse sufficient to alert a supervisor to ongoing violations.  When the supervisor is on notice and fails to take corrective action, say, by better training or closer oversight, liability may attach.  See Brown v. Crawford, 906 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 933, 111 S.Ct. 2056, 114 L.Ed.2d 461 (1991);  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 564-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that isolated instances of unconstitutional activity ordinarily are insufficient to establish a supervisor's policy or custom, or otherwise to show deliberate indifference.  See Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 823-24, 105 S.Ct. at 2436-37;  Rodriquez v. Furtado, 950 F.2d 805, 813 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Voutour, 761 F.2d at 820 (finding no liability though police chief knew of past complaints of brutality;  plaintiff failed to show a pattern so striking that it would permit an inference of supervisor's encouragement or approval of officers' actions).  By like token, proof of mere negligence, without more, is inadequate to ground supervisory liability.  See Febus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, 14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.1994);  Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1261 (D.C.Cir.1987).  Gross negligence can signify deliberate indifference and serve as a basis for supervisory liability if it is causally connected to the actions that work the direct constitutional injury.  See Voutour, 761 F.2d at 820.   Hence, inadequate training of subordinates may be a basis for a section 1983 claim against a superior officer.  See, e.g., Harris, 489 U.S. at 388-89, 109 S.Ct. at 1204-05;  Hopkins v. Andaya, 958 F.2d 881, 888 (9th Cir.1992);  Kibbe v. Springfield, 777 F.2d 801, 807 (1st Cir.1985), cert. dismissed, 480 U.S. 257, 107 S.Ct. 1114, 94 L.Ed.2d 293 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Betancourt-Lebron's Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both Betancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano, appellants approach each ruling from a different direction.  We, therefore, bifurcate our analysis.  We begin with Betancourt-Lebron, but we do not linger long.  The nisi prius roll discloses no evidence on which a claim of supervisory liability against that defendant might properly be predicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record contains evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that the remaining defendants--the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting and the coverup--abridged the decedent's civil rights.  But appellants' attempts to link Betancourt-Lebron to these activities are impuissant.  There is no competent proof of actual participation, or of a policy of tolerating similar violations, or of deliberate indifference.  Nor is there proof of a pattern of misconduct sufficient to put the superintendent of police on inquiry notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, considering the record in the light most congenial to appellants, we can find only tenuous assertions strung together by strands of speculation and surmise.  More is required to survive summary judgment.  See Fragoso, 991 F.2d at 887;  Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8.   Supervisory liability attaches only if a plaintiff can demonstrate by material of evidentiary quality an affirmative link between the supervisor's conduct and the underlying section 1983 violation.  See Bowen 966 F.2d at 20;  Pinto, 737 F.2d at 132.   Here, the record is bereft of any proof, direct or inferential, of a causal link between Betancourt-Lebron's activities and the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights.  It follows that the district court appropriately ordered summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Lopez-Feliciano's Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record before the district court, Lopez-Feliciano's entitlement to summary judgment cannot seriously be disputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Indeed, appellants offer no developed argumentation to the contrary;  rather, they assign error to the denial of their Rule 6(b) motion for additional time in which to marshal an opposition.  Thus, the question presented in respect to this motion is not a matter of evidentiary sufficiency but a matter of procedural orthodoxy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with first principles.  A trial court may enlarge the time for responding to motions, including motions for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See, e.g., United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency ($68,000), 927 F.2d 30, 33-35 (1st Cir.1991);  Mendez v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 900 F.2d 4, 5-6 (1st Cir.1990).  The district court is afforded great leeway in granting or refusing enlargements, see Mendez, 900 F.2d at 6, and its decisions are reviewable only for abuse of that discretion, see id. at 7.   This deference is grounded in common sense.  We deem it self-evident that \"appellate courts cannot too readily agree to meddle in such case-management decisions lest the trial court's authority be undermined and the systems sputter.\"  Id.  However, there are few, if any, guidelines beyond these abecedarian principles, for decisions about whether enlargements of time are warranted tend to be case specific.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts surrounding the Rule 6(b) dispute in this case are simple.  Lopez-Feliciano moved for summary judgment on Friday, June 25, 1993.  Under prevailing practice, appellants' response was due within ten days.  See D.P.R.Loc.R. 311.5, 311.12.  On Friday, July 2, appellants' counsel advised the court, by means of an informative motion, that he would \"be on vacation leave from July 3, 1993 until August 6, 1993.\"   On July 6, after counsel had left for Europe, appellants for the first time requested, in a curt, two-paragraph motion, that the court extend the time for filing their opposition to Lopez-Feliciano's summary judgment initiative until late August.  Appellants' motion alleged, in a purely conclusory fashion, that Lopez-Feliciano's motion \"contained voluminous exhibits and questions of law which require an additional time to study and investigate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, the district court denied the sought-after extension.  The court noted that it had \"patiently granted several requests of this nature [for appellants' benefit] in the past,\" and indicated that it could not justify \"continu[ing] [to] [allow] ... delay in the disposition of pending matters.\"   No opposition was ever filed, and the court granted brevis disposition in Lopez-Feliciano's favor on July 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to pin down what this appeal does not involve.  Appellants did not, by affidavit or other proffer, invoke Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> claiming, say, that they needed more time for additional discovery.  By like token, appellants did not advert to any circumstances beyond their control, such as an attorney's illness, to justify an enlargement of time.  Rather, they sought the extension primarily for the convenience of counsel, who wished to take a leisurely vacation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the ruling is supportable.  The judge, not counsel, must run the court and set the agenda.  This entails establishing reasonable time parameters and ensuring compliance with them.  Reversing the roles of court and counsel would invite chaos.  See de la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1994);  Higuera v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 585 F.2d 555, 557 (1st Cir.1978).  Consequently, it will be a rare case in which an appellate court will fault a trial judge for refusing to elevate counsel's convenience over the need to maintain respect for court rules that require filings to be made within a set time frame.  As we acknowledged in an analogous situation, \"a district judge often must be firm in managing crowded dockets and demanding adherence to announced deadlines.\"  Mendez, 900 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, judges are not tinpot dictators, and firmness must not be confused with tyranny.  But, here, the denial of appellants' Rule 6(b) motion, silhouetted against the historical background of the case, seems reasonable, not despotic or even arbitrary.  Two circumstances are of particular interest in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the disputed extension request came after appellants trespassed on the court's indulgence many times over many months, e.g., amending the complaint three times, obtaining at least five enlargements of time to oppose earlier motions for summary judgment, and successfully rescheduling pretrial conferences on no fewer than four occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants' lawyer exhibited meager respect for the court.  Although his European respite had been planned since March, the lawyer filed his informative motion at the beginning of July and filed the extension request three days after his actual departure.  Appellants' only excuse for this discourtesy rings hollow.  They point out that, on June 18, they filed a request to postpone the pretrial conference, then set for July 20, on the ground that their counsel \"will be in Europe from July 3, 1993 until August 6, 1993.\"   On July 1, the district court granted the request, shifting the conference to August 17.  Appellants contend that their request necessarily alerted the court to counsel's vacation plans, and that the granting of the request lulled them into believing that the court would work around counsel's absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention will not wash.  For one thing, the district court did not act on the request until July 1;  thus, appellants could not have placed any meaningful reliance on the granting of the request.  This lack of reliance is adequately evinced by appellants' subsequent filing, in rapid sequence, of the informative motion and the Rule 6(b) motion.  For another thing, the June 18 request did not fairly apprise the district court of the overall situation.  Appellants limited the request to the timing of the pretrial conference.  The fact that counsel wished personally to attend that proceeding shed no definitive light upon his intentions vis-a-vis more mundane matters.  Indeed, since the request did not mention other aspects of the litigation, the court reasonably could infer that counsel had made suitable arrangements and would not require any special dispensation in regard to motion practice, discovery proceedings, and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue does not require further elaboration.  A petition for a continuance is always suspect when it is within the power of the petitioner to alter the conditions that allegedly preclude him from acting within the allotted period of time.  Here, appellants can identify nothing that suffices to dispel this cloud.  And a variety of other factors support the reasonableness of the district court's action in holding appellants to the rule:  the filing of Lopez-Feliciano's motion for summary judgment came as no surprise;  appellants had ample opportunity--including roughly eight days before counsel departed--within which to respond to it;  they had the benefit of ample discovery, rendering it unlikely that a further opportunity to submit additional materials would have influenced the outcome of the case;  and, finally, they failed to file a Rule 56(f) motion.  This omission speaks volumes.  Litigants who are unprepared to respond in a timely manner to motions for summary judgment cannot be encouraged or permitted to essay end runs around the substantial requirements of Rule 56(f).  See generally Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec.

The test for abuse of discretion is well settled in this circuit, see, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988), and does not bear reiteration.  Applying this test, we conclude that, though the district court's decision perhaps can be characterized as tough-minded, the court made no obvious mistake either in isolating or in weighing the appropriate factors.  While attorneys are entitled to take vacations, a trial lawyer who wishes to plan a lengthy pleasure trip has a corresponding obligation to advise the judge and opposing counsel well in advance, and to make appropriate arrangements for case coverage in his absence.  When, as now, an attorney fails to take elementary precautions, and the trial court declines to alter course, an appellate tribunal should not interfere without compelling reason.  After all, \"[r]ules are rules--and the parties must play by them.\"  Mendez, 900 F.2d at 7.

Appellants offer no developed argumentation to demonstrate that, on the record as it stands, summary judgment could have been avoided.  The point is, therefore, effectively conceded.  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is settled in this circuit that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\").

Sec. 1983 (1988).  In it, appellants strive to convince us that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants Ismael Betancourt-Lebron (sometimes referred to as Ismael Betancourt y Lebron) and Carlos J. Lopez-Feliciano.  Although we are troubled by the district court's action expediting the appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), we affirm the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Statement of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of February 15, 1991, a police officer, Jose M. Colon-Burgos, allegedly shot and killed a young man, Manuel E. Maldonado-Irizarry, in the line of duty.  The decedent's family members, appellants here, brought a section 1983 suit in which they claimed, inter alia, that Colon-Burgos used excessive force;  that the homicide constituted a wrongful deprivation of the decedent's civil rights;  and that other law enforcement officers conspired to hide the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting this offensive, appellants cut a wide swath;  they sued Colon-Burgos, several of his confreres, and certain high-ranking officials who had no direct connection to the shooting or its aftermath.  Betancourt-Lebron, who was the superintendent of police when the incident occurred, and Lopez-Feliciano, the former superintendent, fell into this latter group.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellants alleged in substance that Betancourt-Lebron did not adequately supervise officers under his command, and thereby exhibited deliberate indifference to the proper discharge of his duties.  Lopez-Feliciano, appellants said, exhibited similar indifference during his tenure as superintendent, and, in addition, failed properly to train members of the police force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 22, 1993, Betancourt-Lebron moved for summary judgment on appellants' third amended complaint.  Appellants requested, and received, several extensions of time.  Eventually, they tendered an opposition.  On June 25, Lopez-Feliciano moved for summary judgment.  Appellants did not serve an opposition, but, instead, requested a further extension of time within which to respond.  On July 13, the district court denied the motion for more time, and, eight days later, granted both Rule 56 motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) permits the entry of final judgment as to fewer than all the parties or claims in a multi-party action, thus clearing the way for earlier-than-usual appeals, \"upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay\" in entering judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In this case, the district court made the requisite finding and directed entry of judgment notwithstanding that the action remained unadjudicated as to numerous other parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court focused on the existence of a special circumstance:  one of the defendants, Reinaldo Castillo-Rodriguez (Castillo), had declared bankruptcy, triggering the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 362;  the case, the court felt, would likely \"be dormant for a number of months pending the disposition of [the] bankruptcy matter\";  and, therefore, it would \"save time\" to permit the appeal to go forward \"while the issue of the bankruptcy stay was addressed before the bankruptcy court.\"   Because this determination implicates the existence vel non of appellate jurisdiction, we must satisfy ourselves concerning its correctness even though the parties have acquiesced in it.

First, the ruling underlying the proposed judgment must itself be final in the sense that it disposes completely either of all claims against a given defendant or of some discrete substantive claim or set of claims against the defendants generally.  See Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 43.   That requirement plainly is satisfied here;  the orders granting brevis disposition terminated appellants' claims against Betancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step of the Spiegel pavane is harder to master.  It requires tracing the interrelationship between, on one hand, the legal and factual basis of the claims undergirding the proposed judgment (i.e., the jettisoned claims), and on the other hand, the legal and factual basis of the claims remaining in the case.  See id.   Once the court of appeals has prepared the necessary schematic, it must then ponder the balance struck by the district court between the desirability of immediate review and the undesirability of promoting piecemeal appeals.

Appellants sued Betancourt-Lebron and Lopez-Feliciano for improperly discharging supervisory responsibilities in ways that led to the decedent's death.  But adjudicating those claims necessitates an exploration of the facts concerning the shooting and alleged coverup.  See, e.g., Voutour v. Vitale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451880\"><a href=\"/opinion/451880/james-t-voutour-v-harold-vitale-james-t-voutour-v-harold-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 820-21 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span> (1986).  Thus, there is a significant imbrication between the jettisoned claims and the remaining claims.  District courts should go very slowly in employing Rule 54(b) when, as in this instance, the factual underpinnings of the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims are intertwined.  See Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the Rule 54(b) determination rests on shaky ground for other reasons.  In the first place, whether the record is scanned from the standpoint of the plaintiffs, the defendants, or the court, it discloses no urgent need for immediate review.  In the second place, trial of the remaining claims has the potential of mooting the issue of supervisory liability and rendering further appellate review of the summary judgment order superfluous.  Given these circumstances, and given the \"long-settled and prudential policy against scattershot [appeals],\" id. at 42, the rush to enter an immediate judgment strikes us as problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the scales are not entirely out of balance.  The judgment did dispose fully of all claims against a group of parties--appellees and Velez--and those claims raised a set of unique issues.  And, moreover, the district court had an arguably plausible reason--the enforced stay of litigation on the district court level--for resorting to Rule 54(b).  These factors tend to balance out, to some extent, the factors that counsel in favor of a more deliberate approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we, if writing on a pristine page, would have accorded greater weight to considerations of judicial economy and the importance of discouraging broadly piecemeal appeals, three things persuade us to allow the Rule 54(b) determination to stand:  first, the special circumstance presented by the stay;  second, the differences, both legal and factual, that distinguish the claims against appellees from the claims against the other defendants;  and third, the deference owed to the trial court's determinations under Rule 54(b), see Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 42.   Although the call is excruciatingly close, we are not prepared to say that the court below overstepped the bounds of its discretion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is permissible when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

See Oklahoma City v.

Thus, even if a supervisor lacks actual knowledge of censurable conduct, he may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of such conduct if he would have known of it but for his deliberate indifference or willful blindness, and if he had the power and authority to alleviate it.

Deliberate indifference, however, is not the be-all and the end-all of a section 1983 claim premised on supervisory liability.  As we explain below, there is a causation element as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on a supervisory liability claim, a plaintiff not only must show deliberate indifference or its equivalent, but also must affirmatively connect the supervisor's conduct to the subordinate's violative act or omission.  See Bowen, 966 F.2d at 20;  Lewis v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510752\"><a href=\"/opinion/510752/charles-lewis-v-freddie-smith-mark-smith-and-arnold-holt/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 738 (11th Cir.1988);  Pinto, 737 F.2d at 132.   This causation requirement can be satisfied even if the supervisor did not participate directly in the conduct that violated a citizen's rights;  for example, a sufficient casual nexus may be found if the supervisor knew of, overtly or tacitly approved of, or purposely disregarded the conduct.  See, e.g., Larez v. Los Angeles, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span>, 646 (9th Cir.1991);  Lipsett v.

Consequently, deliberate indifference to violations of constitutional rights can forge the necessary linkage between the acts or omissions of supervisory personnel and the misconduct of their subordinates.  See Gaudreault v. Salem, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554019\"><a href=\"/opinion/554019/robert-a-gaudreault-v-municipality-of-salem-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 208 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When the supervisor is on notice and fails to take corrective action, say, by better training or closer oversight, liability may attach.  See Brown v. Crawford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543696\"><a href=\"/opinion/543696/columbus-brown-aka-lenwood-johnson-v-fred-crawford-director-of-dade/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 671 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 823-24, 105 S.Ct. at 2436-37;  Rodriquez v. Furtado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573067\"><a href=\"/opinion/573067/shirley-mello-rodriques-v-joseph-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 813 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Voutour, 761 F.2d at 820 (finding no liability though police chief knew of past complaints of brutality;  plaintiff failed to show a pattern so striking that it would permit an inference of supervisor's encouragement or approval of officers' actions).  By like token, proof of mere negligence, without more, is inadequate to ground supervisory liability.  See Febus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195148\"><a href=\"/opinion/195148/rodriguez-v-lebron/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.1994);  Haynesworth v.

Gross negligence can signify deliberate indifference and serve as a basis for supervisory liability if it is causally connected to the actions that work the direct constitutional injury.  See Voutour, 761 F.2d at 820.   Hence, inadequate training of subordinates may be a basis for a section 1983 claim against a superior officer.

We, therefore, bifurcate our analysis.  We begin with Betancourt-Lebron, but we do not linger long.  The nisi prius roll discloses no evidence on which a claim of supervisory liability against that defendant might properly be predicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record contains evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that the remaining defendants--the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting and the coverup--abridged the decedent's civil rights.  But appellants' attempts to link Betancourt-Lebron to these activities are impuissant.  There is no competent proof of actual participation, or of a policy of tolerating similar violations, or of deliberate indifference.  Nor is there proof of a pattern of misconduct sufficient to put the superintendent of police on inquiry notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, considering the record in the light most congenial to appellants, we can find only tenuous assertions strung together by strands of speculation and surmise.  More is required to survive summary judgment.  See Fragoso, 991 F.2d at 887;  Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8.   Supervisory liability attaches only if a plaintiff can demonstrate by material of evidentiary quality an affirmative link between the supervisor's conduct and the underlying section 1983 violation.  See Bowen 966 F.2d at 20;  Pinto, 737 F.2d at 132.   Here, the record is bereft of any proof, direct or inferential, of a causal link between Betancourt-Lebron's activities and the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights.  It follows that the district court appropriately ordered summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Lopez-Feliciano's Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record before the district court, Lopez-Feliciano's entitlement to summary judgment cannot seriously be disputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Indeed, appellants offer no developed argumentation to the contrary;  rather, they assign error to the denial of their Rule 6(b) motion for additional time in which to marshal an opposition.  Thus, the question presented in respect to this motion is not a matter of evidentiary sufficiency but a matter of procedural orthodoxy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with first principles.  A trial court may enlarge the time for responding to motions, including motions for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See, e.g., United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency ($68,000), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556639\"><a href=\"/opinion/556639/united-states-v-one-lot-of-us-currency-68000-etc-giovanni/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 33-35 (1st Cir.1991);  Mendez v.

The district court is afforded great leeway in granting or refusing enlargements, see Mendez, 900 F.2d at 6, and its decisions are reviewable only for abuse of that discretion, see id. at 7.   This deference is grounded in common sense.  We deem it self-evident that \"appellate courts cannot too readily agree to meddle in such case-management decisions lest the trial court's authority be undermined and the systems sputter.\"  Id.  However, there are few, if any, guidelines beyond these abecedarian principles, for decisions about whether enlargements of time are warranted tend to be case specific.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts surrounding the Rule 6(b) dispute in this case are simple.  Lopez-Feliciano moved for summary judgment on Friday, June 25, 1993.  Under prevailing practice, appellants' response was due within ten days.  See D.P.R.Loc.R. 311.5, 311.12.  On Friday, July 2, appellants' counsel advised the court, by means of an informative motion, that he would \"be on vacation leave from July 3, 1993 until August 6, 1993.\"   On July 6, after counsel had left for Europe, appellants for the first time requested, in a curt, two-paragraph motion, that the court extend the time for filing their opposition to Lopez-Feliciano's summary judgment initiative until late August.  Appellants' motion alleged, in a purely conclusory fashion, that Lopez-Feliciano's motion \"contained voluminous exhibits and questions of law which require an additional time to study and investigate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, the district court denied the sought-after extension.  The court noted that it had \"patiently granted several requests of this nature [for appellants' benefit] in the past,\" and indicated that it could not justify \"continu[ing] [to] [allow] ... delay in the disposition of pending matters.\"   No opposition was ever filed, and the court granted brevis disposition in Lopez-Feliciano's favor on July 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to pin down what this appeal does not involve.  Appellants did not, by affidavit or other proffer, invoke Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> claiming, say, that they needed more time for additional discovery.  By like token, appellants did not advert to any circumstances beyond their control, such as an attorney's illness, to justify an enlargement of time.  Rather, they sought the extension primarily for the convenience of counsel, who wished to take a leisurely vacation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the ruling is supportable.  The judge, not counsel, must run the court and set the agenda.  This entails establishing reasonable time parameters and ensuring compliance with them.  Reversing the roles of court and counsel would invite chaos.  See de la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195174\"><a href=\"/opinion/195174/de-la-torre-v-continental-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1994);  Higuera v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360308\"><a href=\"/opinion/360308/iris-higuera-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 557 (1st Cir.1978).  Consequently, it will be a rare case in which an appellate court will fault a trial judge for refusing to elevate counsel's convenience over the need to maintain respect for court rules that require filings to be made within a set time frame.  As we acknowledged in an analogous situation, \"a district judge often must be firm in managing crowded dockets and demanding adherence to announced deadlines.\"  Mendez, 900 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, judges are not tinpot dictators, and firmness must not be confused with tyranny.  But, here, the denial of appellants' Rule 6(b) motion, silhouetted against the historical background of the case, seems reasonable, not despotic or even arbitrary.  Two circumstances are of particular interest in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the disputed extension request came after appellants trespassed on the court's indulgence many times over many months, e.g., amending the complaint three times, obtaining at least five enlargements of time to oppose earlier motions for summary judgment, and successfully rescheduling pretrial conferences on no fewer than four occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants' lawyer exhibited meager respect for the court.  Although his European respite had been planned since March, the lawyer filed his informative motion at the beginning of July and filed the extension request three days after his actual departure.  Appellants' only excuse for this discourtesy rings hollow.  They point out that, on June 18, they filed a request to postpone the pretrial conference, then set for July 20, on the ground that their counsel \"will be in Europe from July 3, 1993 until August 6, 1993.\"   On July 1, the district court granted the request, shifting the conference to August 17.  Appellants contend that their request necessarily alerted the court to counsel's vacation plans, and that the granting of the request lulled them into believing that the court would work around counsel's absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention will not wash.  For one thing, the district court did not act on the request until July 1;  thus, appellants could not have placed any meaningful reliance on the granting of the request.  This lack of reliance is adequately evinced by appellants' subsequent filing, in rapid sequence, of the informative motion and the Rule 6(b) motion.  For another thing, the June 18 request did not fairly apprise the district court of the overall situation.  Appellants limited the request to the timing of the pretrial conference.  The fact that counsel wished personally to attend that proceeding shed no definitive light upon his intentions vis-a-vis more mundane matters.  Indeed, since the request did not mention other aspects of the litigation, the court reasonably could infer that counsel had made suitable arrangements and would not require any special dispensation in regard to motion practice, discovery proceedings, and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue does not require further elaboration.  A petition for a continuance is always suspect when it is within the power of the petitioner to alter the conditions that allegedly preclude him from acting within the allotted period of time.  Here, appellants can identify nothing that suffices to dispel this cloud.  And a variety of other factors support the reasonableness of the district court's action in holding appellants to the rule:  the filing of Lopez-Feliciano's motion for summary judgment came as no surprise;  appellants had ample opportunity--including roughly eight days before counsel departed--within which to respond to it;  they had the benefit of ample discovery, rendering it unlikely that a further opportunity to submit additional materials would have influenced the outcome of the case;  and, finally, they failed to file a Rule 56(f) motion.  This omission speaks volumes.  Litigants who are unprepared to respond in a timely manner to motions for summary judgment cannot be encouraged or permitted to essay end runs around the substantial requirements of Rule 56(f).  See generally Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 988 (1st Cir.1988) (discussing requirements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When all is said and done, the district court's refusal to grant the requested extension comes down to a matter of discretion.  The test for abuse of discretion is well settled in this circuit, see, e.g., United States v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593292\"><a href=\"/opinion/593292/united-states-v-leslie-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516410\"><a href=\"/opinion/516410/the-independent-oil-and-chemical-workers-of-quincy-inc-v-the-procter/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir.1988), and does not bear reiteration.  Applying this test, we conclude that, though the district court's decision perhaps can be characterized as tough-minded, the court made no obvious mistake either in isolating or in weighing the appropriate factors.  While attorneys are entitled to take vacations, a trial lawyer who wishes to plan a lengthy pleasure trip has a corresponding obligation to advise the judge and opposing counsel well in advance, and to make appropriate arrangements for case coverage in his absence.  When, as now, an attorney fails to take elementary precautions, and the trial court declines to alter course, an appellate tribunal should not interfere without compelling reason.  After all, \"[r]ules are rules--and the parties must play by them.\"  Mendez, 900 F.2d at 7.   Here, appellants have articulated no plausible basis for us to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the district court did not err in denying appellants' Rule 6(b) motion ends our inquiry.  Appellants offer no developed argumentation to demonstrate that, on the record as it stands, summary judgment could have been avoided.  The point is, therefore, effectively conceded.  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is settled in this circuit that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\").  The judgment in favor of Lopez-Feliciano must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Having examined the record with care, we are satisfied that the appeal is properly before us.  In the exercise of that discerned jurisdiction, we conclude that the court below did not err either in denying appellants further time or in granting appellees' motions for summary judgment.  Although the rhetoric of supervisory liability reverberates from the pages of appellants' briefs, the record contains no evidence of culpability sufficient to relate the rhetoric to the reality of events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, separately concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the result reached in this case and commend the writing judge for his scholarly and clearly written discussion of supervisory liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the result reached on the appellate jurisdiction question, but I do not agree that the issue was \"excruciatingly close.\"   I think the district court was clearly correct in finding that \"there is no just reason for delay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lopez-Feliciano served as superintendent of police from early 1986 until he resigned effective December 31, 1988.

Appellants have not ventured an appeal from this aspect of the court's order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, ... or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment....</p>\n        <p>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Though we permit the appeal to go forward, we urge the district courts, in borderline cases, to exercise restraint rather than allowing appeals to proceed in an inchmeal fashion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Appellants did proffer two previous administrative complaints, one naming Colon-Burgos and the other naming Castillo.  These complaints have only marginal relevance to the claims at issue in this appeal.  The complaint against Colon-Burgos relates to his conduct during an alleged dispute with his former mother-in-law.  The complaint against Castillo relates to his alleged discourteousness in refusing to return a firearm to its owner.  There is absolutely no connection between these complaints and the charges levelled against the officers in this case.  A fortiori, there is no connection between the complaints and appellants' claims against the appellees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This statement reflects our assessment of the record as it stands, recognizing that, even if unopposed, a motion for summary judgment can only be granted if the record discloses the movant's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.  See Mendez v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539215\"><a href=\"/opinion/539215/julio-mendez-aka-julio-mendez-rodriguez-v-banco-popular-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The rule on which appellants rely provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>[T]he court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) ... order [a time] period enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order, or (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect....</p>\n        <p>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The rule reads:</p>\n        <p>Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion [for summary judgment] that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>\n        <p>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Indeed, given the wholly conclusory nature of the other reasons advanced in the July 6 motion, the plethoric discovery already completed, and the similarity between Lopez-Feliciano's motion and the summary judgment motion filed earlier by Betancourt-Lebron (to which appellants had already responded), there was ample room for the district court to conclude that counsel's convenience comprised the only impetus behind the extension request</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
