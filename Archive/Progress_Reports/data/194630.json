The district court determined that\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nplaintiff  Dennis  VanHaaren  had  forfeited  coverage  under the\n\n                  \n\n*Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\nuninsured motorist  policy issued by defendant  State Farm Mutual\n\nAutomobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") by not complying with\n\nState Farm's  requests that he  submit to an  independent medical\n\nexamination (\"IME\").  The district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of State Farm, and VanHaaren appealed.  We affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          VanHaaren  was involved in an automobile collision with\n\nan uninsured motorist on  July 1, 1989.  Alleging permanent  back\n\ninjury,  VanHaaren soon  exhausted  the  $5,000 medical  payments\n\ncoverage  provided  under  his State  Farm  automobile  insurance\n\npolicy,  and in March 1991  he submitted a  $100,000 claim repre-\n\nsenting the full amount of the uninsured motorist coverage  under\n\nthe State Farm  policy.  The State Farm policy contained a provi-\n\nsion  (\"IME clause\")  which  required VanHaaren  to submit  to an\n\n\"examin[ation]  by physicians chosen and  paid by [State Farm] as\n\noften as [State Farm] reasonably may require.\"\n\n          On April 8,  and again on May 2, 1991, State Farm wrote\n\nVanHaaren's  counsel requesting  confirmation that  VanHaaren was\n\nresiding in Florida, so that an  IME could be conducted in Flori-\n\nda.   On  May 17,  VanHaaren's counsel  advised  State Farm  that\n\nVanHaaren had  relocated to  North Carolina  to take a  job at  a\n\nsummer resort,  and suggested that  \"a realistic approach  to the\n\ncase would  be to allow  [State Farm] to  obtain an [IME]  in the\n\nAshville, North Carolina area  and then to set up  an arbitration\n\nor mediation.\"   The State Farm  representative responded, noting\n\nthat the policy included an  arbitration provision.  He requested\n\nthat  VanHaaren's  counsel advise  State Farm  \"where [VanHaaren]\n\nwill be for a reasonable  period of time so I may  refer [sic] to\n\nthe proper State Farm office to  make [IME] arrangements.\"  It is\n\nconceded that VanHaaren's counsel  did not respond to the  latter\n\nrequest.\n\n          On September 13,  VanHaaren brought an action  in Maine\n\nSuperior  Court, which  State  Farm promptly  removed to  federal\n\ndistrict court.  Counsel to State Farm wrote VanHaaren's  counsel\n\non  December 16,  requesting  confirmation  that  VanHaaren would\n\nattend an IME scheduled for January 14, 1992, in Portland, Maine.\n\nOne  week later,  VanHaaren's  counsel declined  to confirm  Van-\n\nHaaren's  attendance at the  IME, noting  that he  considered the\n\nusual  diagnoses of  the  orthopedist chosen  by  State Farm  too\n\n\"conservative,\"  inviting State  Farm to  propose other  orthope-\n\ndists,  and inquiring  why  the IME  could  not be  conducted  in\n\nFlorida  where VanHaaren  was  again residing.   Otherwise,  Van-\n\nHaaren's counsel suggested, State Farm \"may bring a motion for an\n\nexamination in the [district court].\"   On January 10, 1992, over\n\nVanHaaren's  opposition, the  presiding magistrate  judge granted\n\nState  Farm's motion to compel VanHaaren to attend the IME sched-\n\nuled for January 14 in Portland.  VanHaaren complied.\n\n          In  May 1992  the district  court granted  State Farm's\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment  on the  ground  that  VanHaaren's\n\nconduct  before and after filing suit constituted a breach of the\n\n                                3\n\nIME clause, barring recovery  under the uninsured motorist provi-\n\nsion in the State Farm policy.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   Applicable State Law\n                         \n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de  novo, employ-\n                                                        \n\ning the same criteria incumbent upon the district court.

Summary judgment is appropriate where the\n\nrecord, including  the pleadings, depositions, answers  to inter-\n\nrogatories,  admissions on  file, and  affidavits, viewed  in the\n\nlight most favorable  to the nonmoving party,  reveals no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the moving party  is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Canal\n                                                                 \n\nIns. Co.  v.

Nov. 24,\n\n1992)].\n\n          Although the  parties agree that Maine  law informs the\n\npresent  determination  as  to the  materiality  of  any fact  in\n                                               \n\ngenuine dispute,  see Blanchard  v. Peerless Ins.

Absent  controlling state  court  precedent, a\n\n                                4\n\nfederal  court sitting in diversity may certify a state law issue\n\nto the state's  highest court, or undertake  its prediction \"when\n\nthe course  [the] state courts  would take is  reasonably clear.\"\n\nPorter  v. Nutter, 913 F.2d  37, 41 n.4  (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting\n                 \n\nBi-Rite Enters., Inc.  v. Bruce Miner Co., 757 F.2d  440, 443 n.3\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1985)).  See  also American Waste  &amp; Pollution Control\n                                                                 \n\nCo.  v.  Browning-Ferris, Inc.,  949  F.2d 1384,  1386  (5th Cir.\n                              \n\n1991);  S &amp; R Metals,  Inc. v. C.

The prognostic chore is reasonably straightfor-\n\nward in the instant case.\n\n          State Farm  argues that  Maine law would  follow estab-\n\nlished contract  law principles, permitting the  insurer to avoid\n\nall  liability  under its  insurance  contract  where the  policy\n\nholder commits an anticipatory breach of a condition precedent to\n\ncoverage by \"refusing\" to  submit to an IME, irrespective  of any\n\nprejudice to  the insurer.  In  our view, its assessment  is less\n\nthan prescient.\n\n          In Ouellette v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., 495 A.2d 1232\n                                                  \n\n(Me.  1985), the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law\n\nCourt, explicitly  \"abandon[ed]  the  analysis  of  a  negotiated\n\ncontract,\" under which an  insurer's performance would be excused\n\non  the bare showing that the insured breached a condition prece-\n\ndent  to coverage  by  inexcusably delaying  notification of  the\n\npolicy claim for four years.  Id. at 1235.  Rather, the Law Court\n                                 \n\nheld that the insurer  must prove \"that the notice  provision was\n\nin  fact breached, and . . .  that the insurer  was prejudiced by\n                                                                 \n\n                                5\n\nthe insured's  delay.\"  Id. (emphasis added).   Ouellette brought\n                                                         \n\nMaine  law in  line with  the growing  majority of  jurisdictions\n\nwhich acknowledge that a post-occurrence  forfeiture of insurance\n\ncoverage  is rarely to be invoked, absent actual prejudice to the\n\ninsurer, because  (1) insurance  policies are contracts  of adhe-\n\nsion,  (2) the insured has prepaid the premiums for coverage, and\n\n(3) insurance coverage furthers broader public policy aims.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., St. Paul Fire &amp;  Marine Ins. Co. v. Petzold, 418  F.2d 303,\n                                                 \n\n305 (1st Cir.  1969) (applying  New Hampshire law  to \"notice  of\n\nclaim\"  provision); Johnson  Controls, Inc.  v. Bowes,  381 Mass.\n                                                     \n\n278,  282-83,  409 N.E.2d  185,  188  (1980) (\"notice  of  claim\"\n\nprovision); cf. Piro  v. Pekin  Ins. Co., 514  N.E.2d 1231,  1234\n                                        \n\n(Ill. App. Ct.  1987) (\"Declaring forfeiture  of the benefits  of\n\n[fire] insurance  bought  and paid  for  based solely  on  events\n\noccurring  subsequent to  the event  of the  insured-against loss\n\nshould be avoided.\").  As Maine law plainly requires a showing of\n\nprejudice for  \"notice of  claim\" violations, we  can discern  no\n\nsound  reason  to anticipate  a  less  stringent requirement  for\n\nbreach of  an IME clause  in an  uninsured motorist policy.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nBankers Ins. Co. v.  Macias, 475 So.2d 1216, 1217-18  (Fla. 1985)\n                           \n\n(breach of \"notice of claim\" provision raises rebuttable presump-\n\ntion  of prejudice  to  insurer, whereas  breach of  \"cooperation\n\nclause\" in policy raises no  presumption but requires showing  by\n\n                                6\n\ninsurer that  breach was  material and caused  substantial preju-\n\ndice).2\n\n          State Farm endeavors to  forfend against the portent of\n\nthe  Ouellette decision on the  ground that the \"prejudice\" issue\n              \n\nwas  not preserved in the  district court.   State Farm correctly\n\npoints out that VanHaaren neither cited to the Ouellette decision\n                                                        \n\nnor argued to  the district  court that Maine  law would  require\n\nproof of prejudice.  Although the district court acknowledged the\n\n                    \n\n     2VanHaaren contends that the IME clause is unenforceable, as\nit violates  the public policy enunciated in  the Maine uninsured\nmotorist statute, Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A,   2902  (1990 &amp;\nSupp. 1991), by impermissibly  constricting the scope of mandated\nuninsured motorist coverage.   First, VanHaaren waived this claim\nby failing to  raise it before the district  court.  Sandstrom v.\n                                                              \nChemlawn Corp.,  904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990).  Second, courts\n              \nquite  generally  have  found  that reasonable  \"proof  of  loss\"\nobligations serve  a legitimate purpose, affording  the insurer a\nmore objective  accounting of the insured's  injuries or damages.\nSee McKimm  v. Bell, 790 S.W.2d 526,  528 (Tenn. 1990) (and cases\n                   \ncited  therein); cf. Huntt v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 527\n                                                            \nA.2d 1333,  1335 (Md. App.  1987) (noting that  no-fault personal\ninjury protection (\"PIP\") coverage was never \"intended to provide\na PIP  claimant with a blank  check\").  Third, the  IME clause is\nreadily distinguishable from  other types  of uninsured  motorist\npolicy restrictions  invalidated by  the Maine  Law Court.   See,\n                                                                \ne.g., Lanzo  v. State Farm Mut.  Auto. Ins. Co., 524  A.2d 47, 50\n                                               \n(Me. 1987)  (statutory term \"hit-and-run\" does  not allow insurer\nto restrict  uninsured motorist coverage  to accidents  involving\nphysical  contact).  Given the relative ease of compliance with a\n\"reasonable\" IME request,  an IME clause does  not unduly circum-\nscribe  uninsured  motorist  coverage  or remove  it  beyond  the\ninsured's control.   Fourth, the  Law Court has  suggested, quite\nclearly, that insurers are  entitled to the protection of  an IME\nat  \"critical stages\"  in the  uninsured motorist  claim process.\nSee Home Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 603 A.2d 860, 861 (Me.\n                                         \n1992).  Finally, the principal  case upon which VanHaaren  relies\nis  inapposite.  Benson v.  Nationwide Mut. Ins.  Co., 238 S.E.2d\n                                                     \n683  (S.C. 1977),  turns on  the peculiar  language of  the South\nCarolina  uninsured motorist insurance  statute (\"[T]he uninsured\nmotorist  provision  shall  not  require  anything not  otherwise\nherein  provided for. . . .\"),  which disallows  all proscriptive\npolicy provisions not specifically authorized by statute.  Id. at\n                                                              \n684.\n\n                                7\n\nsignificance of Ouellette, it  expressly bypassed the issue since\n                         \n\nVanHaaren had neither  contended that State Farm  was required to\n\nshow  \"prejudice\" under Maine law, nor  argued that prejudice had\n\nnot been established.  Although loathe to conclude that VanHaaren\n\nwaived the \"prejudice\"  issue, we do so in light  of the district\n\ncourt's pellucid  determination that VanHaaren had  made no claim\n\nthat State Farm was  either required to demonstrate  prejudice or\n\nfailed  to do so.3   In these  circumstances, VanHaaren's failure\n\nto move  for reconsideration of  the district court  order should\n\nnot be excused.  See Boston Celtics Ltd. Partnership v. Shaw, 908\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1041, 1045  (1st Cir.  1990); Brown  v.

Breach of IME Clause\n                        \n\n          VanHaaren nevertheless contends that State  Farm failed\n\nto  establish beyond  reasonable disputation the  other essential\n\nelement of  its defense     that he  breached the  IME clause  by\n\n\"refusing\" to comply with State Farm's reasonable IME requests.\n\n                    \n\n     3The district court opinion could not have been more clear:\n\n     The plaintiff,  however, does not argue  that the court\n     must  find  prejudice  resulting  from  his  failure to\n     submit to an IME  upon request in order to  relieve the\n     defendant of its obligation  to him under the uninsured\n     motorist provisions of the policy.  Nor does he contest\n     the defendant's  assertion that the amount  of time and\n     money  spent  by State  Farm to  secure  an IME  of the\n     plaintiff constitutes prejudice.  He simply argues that\n     any expenses incurred by State Farm are a result of its\n     failure to cooperate with him.\n\n                                8\n\n          As  a  general  rule,  whether  there  was  substantial\n\ncompliance with a condition precedent in an insurance contract is\n\na question of fact ill-suited to disposition on summary judgment.\n\nSee,  e.g., Piro,  514 N.E.2d  at 1234  (noting that  whether the\n                \n\ninsured provided  necessary information \"too late\"  normally is a\n\nquestion  for  the factfinder).   Under  Maine  law, even  if the\n\ninsurer  suffers  appreciable  prejudice  from  the  breach,  the\n\ninsured  may still  quell  the insurer's  affirmative defense  by\n\nproffering a  valid excuse  or justification  for the  failure or\n\nrefusal to comply.   See Ouellette, 495 A.2d at 1234 (noting that\n                                  \n\nif insured's delay was \"unreasonable or unexplained,\" insurer may\n\navoid coverage by demonstrating  \"prejudice\"); cf.

Rather, the insurer must activate\nthe contractual  obligation  by communicating  a  reasonable  IME\nrequest to the insured.   Cf. Weber v. General Acci. Fire  &amp; Life\n                                                                 \nAssur.

State Farm  posits  that it  made three\nreasonable IME requests on April 8, May 2, and June 10, 1991, all\nprior  to  the date  VanHaaren filed  suit.   On the  other hand,\nVanHaaren's  attorney  characterizes State  Farm's pre-litigation\ninquiries  as exploratory  settlement  negotiations.   Thus,  the\nasserted excuse for VanHaaren's  noncompliance is tantamount to a\nclaim of mutual miscommunication.\n     Viewed in  isolation from  the events which  followed, these\ninitial  communications might reasonably  be thought sufficiently\nindefinite to  have  excused VanHaaren's  failure  to  cooperate.\nMuch  of  the language  in the  State  Farm letters  was arguably\nprecatory (e.g.,  I \"would  like your  agreement .  .  .\" and  \"I\n               \nrequest permission  . . .\").   The IME clause provides  that Van-\nHaaren must  submit to an  examination \"by physicians  chosen\" by\nState Farm, conceivably suggesting that the insured might reason-\nably reserve assent  until such time as a  doctor was \"chosen\" by\nState Farm.   See Ray  v. Blue Alliance  Mut. Ins. Co.,  594 A.2d\n                                                      \n1110,  1111  (Me.  1991)  (ambiguous  policy  language  construed\nagainst insurer).

An IME clause  is a condition  precedent which\n\nimposes  a duty  of performance  on the  insured.

But  regretfully I must\n\ndissent.\n\n          Normally  I  would  agree with  the  court's conclusion\n\nthat:\n\n          As no  reasonable trier  of fact  could find  that Van-\n          Haaren acted in good faith  in refusing to comply  with\n          State Farm's December 16  IME request, and [that]  Van-\n          Haaren inexplicably  refrained from raising  the preju-\n          dice issue  below, summary judgment for  State Farm was\n          proper.\n\nIn this  case, however,  there is  no evidence in  the record  to\n\nsupport the conclusion that VanHaaren failed to act in good faith\n\nin refusing to  comply with State  Farm's repeated IME  requests.\n\nAll that the record thus far reveals is that VanHaaren's counsel,\n                                                                \n\nrather than VanHaaren himself, failed to act in good faith.\n\n          In  Dunbar v. Triangle Lumber  and Supply Co., 816 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n126  (3d Cir. 1987), the Court of  Appeals for the Third Circuit,\n\nconsidered  the appeal  of a  plaintiff whose complaint  had been\n\ndismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to prosecute\n\nand comply  with an order of the court.  Plaintiff's counsel had \n\nfailed to  enter an appearance  and had failed  to attend  a pre-\n\ntrail conference in blatant disregard of numerous orders from the\n\ndistrict  court.   The court  finally dismissed  plaintiff's com-\n\nplaint  on the ground that plaintiff had failed to prosecute. The\n\nCourt of  Appeals reversed  the district  court and remanded  the\n\n                                16\n\ncase for further proceedings.  The court reasoned that  dismissal\n\nin  this context is a  \"drastic tool\" which  may appropriately be\n\ninvoked  after careful analysis of several factors:\n\n          (1) the extent of the party's  personal responsibility;\n                                                                \n          (2) the prejudice to the  adversary caused by the fail-\n                           \n          ure to meet the scheduling  orders and respond to  dis-\n          covery; (3) a history  of dilatoriness; (4) whether the\n                               \n          conduct  of the party or the attorney was willful or in\n                                                           \n          bad  faith;  (5) the  effectiveness of  sanctions other\n                    \n          than dismissal, which entails  an analysis of  alterna-\n                                                                 \n          tive sanctions;  and  (6) the  meritoriousness  of  the\n                                                        \n          claim or defense.\n\nDunbar, 816 F.2d at  128 (emphasis in original).   In plaintiff's\n      \n\ncase,  the Third Circuit determined that there was no evidence in\n\nthe  record  that plaintiff  \"bore  some  responsibility for  the\n\nflagrant actions of her counsel.\"  Id. at 129.  Accordingly,  the\n                                      \n\ncourt  concluded that  the case  should be  remanded to  permit a\n\nhearing  based on all the above factors after notice to plaintiff\n\nand  her counsel. Id.   As an example to the district court about\n                     \n\nthe  \"alternative sanctions\",  other  than  the dismissal,  which\n\nmight  be considered, the court of appeals assessed costs person-\n\nally against plaintiff's counsel. Id.\n                                     \n\n          Similarly  in  Velazquez-Rivera  v.  Sea-Land  Service,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  920 F.2d 1072 (1st Cir. 1990), this circuit considered the\n    \n\nappeal of plaintiffs whose  case had been dismissed due  to coun-\n\nsel's  failure to  attend pre-trial  conferences and  comply with\n\nother orders of the  district court.  Before the  district court,\n\nplain-tiffs'  counsel,  in an  extraordinary  act  of contrition,\n\n\"requested that sanctions be imposed against himself as attorney,\n\nbut that, the plaintiffs not being at fault, the dismissal of the\n\n                                17\n\naction  be set aside.\" Velazquez-Rivera,  920 F.2d at  1074.  The\n                                       \n\ndistrict  court  denied  counsel's  requests  and  dismissed  the\n\naction.   This court reversed the district court and remanded the\n\ncase  for further  proceedings. Id.  at 1079.   We  reasoned that\n                                   \n\n\"dismissal should  be  employed only  if the  district court  has\n\ndetermined that  it could not  fashion an `equally  effective but\n\nless drastic  remedy.'\"  Id. at  1076.  We also  reasoned that it\n                            \n\nwas significant that  the failure to follow the  district court's\n\norders was  due to counsel's mistakes rather  to any bad faith on\n\nthe part of plaintiffs.  Id. \n                            \n\n          Here, thus  far  the record  reveals  that  VanHaaren's\n\ncounsel, rather  than VanHaaren himself,  acted in  bad faith  in\n\nrefusing State Farm's repeated  IME requests.  It  seems to me  a\n\nrather drastic and tragic remedy to dispose adversely of \n\nVanHaaren's claim because  of the  conduct of his  attorney.   Of\n\ncourse, it  may very well be  that VanHaaren himself knew  of the\n\nIME  requests, and himself refused to  comply with them.  If that\n\nis the case, then summary  judgment in favor of State  Farm would\n\nbe appropriate.  But, at the very least, the district court ought\n\nto hold a  hearing to determine whether  VanHaaren bears personal\n\nresponsibility for the actions of his counsel.  If VanHaaren does\n                                                                 \n\nnot bear personal  responsibility, and if  failure to respond  to\n   \n\nthe IME requests was due simply to dereliction on the part of his\n\ncounsel, then the court  ought to consider a less  drastic remedy\n\nthan  to dispose  adversely  of his  action.   One  such  remedy,\n\npursuant  to Velazquez and Dunbar  might be in  the form of sanc-\n                                 \n\n                                18\n\ntions  imposed or  personal  costs  assessed against  VanHaaren's\n\ncounsel.\n\n          For the foregoing  reasons I respectfully dissent  from\n\nthe judgment of the court.\n\n                                19\n",

The district court determined that\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nplaintiff  Dennis  VanHaaren  had  forfeited  coverage  under the\n\n                  \n\n*Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\nuninsured motorist  policy issued by defendant  State Farm Mutual\n\nAutomobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") by not complying with\n\nState Farm's  requests that he  submit to an  independent medical\n\nexamination (\"IME\").  The district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of State Farm, and VanHaaren appealed.  We affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          VanHaaren  was involved in an automobile collision with\n\nan uninsured motorist on  July 1, 1989.  Alleging permanent  back\n\ninjury,  VanHaaren soon  exhausted  the  $5,000 medical  payments\n\ncoverage  provided  under  his State  Farm  automobile  insurance\n\npolicy,  and in March 1991  he submitted a  $100,000 claim repre-\n\nsenting the full amount of the uninsured motorist coverage  under\n\nthe State Farm  policy.  The State Farm policy contained a provi-\n\nsion  (\"IME clause\")  which  required VanHaaren  to submit  to an\n\n\"examin[ation]  by physicians chosen and  paid by [State Farm] as\n\noften as [State Farm] reasonably may require.\"\n\n          On April 8,  and again on May 2, 1991, State Farm wrote\n\nVanHaaren's  counsel requesting  confirmation that  VanHaaren was\n\nresiding in Florida, so that an  IME could be conducted in Flori-\n\nda.   On  May 17,  VanHaaren's counsel  advised  State Farm  that\n\nVanHaaren had  relocated to  North Carolina  to take a  job at  a\n\nsummer resort,  and suggested that  \"a realistic approach  to the\n\ncase would  be to allow  [State Farm] to  obtain an [IME]  in the\n\nAshville, North Carolina area  and then to set up  an arbitration\n\nor mediation.\"   The State Farm  representative responded, noting\n\nthat the policy included an  arbitration provision.  He requested\n\nthat  VanHaaren's  counsel advise  State Farm  \"where [VanHaaren]\n\nwill be for a reasonable  period of time so I may  refer [sic] to\n\nthe proper State Farm office to  make [IME] arrangements.\"  It is\n\nconceded that VanHaaren's counsel  did not respond to the  latter\n\nrequest.\n\n          On September 13,  VanHaaren brought an action  in Maine\n\nSuperior  Court, which  State  Farm promptly  removed to  federal\n\ndistrict court.  Counsel to State Farm wrote VanHaaren's  counsel\n\non  December 16,  requesting  confirmation  that  VanHaaren would\n\nattend an IME scheduled for January 14, 1992, in Portland, Maine.\n\nOne  week later,  VanHaaren's  counsel declined  to confirm  Van-\n\nHaaren's  attendance at the  IME, noting  that he  considered the\n\nusual  diagnoses of  the  orthopedist chosen  by  State Farm  too\n\n\"conservative,\"  inviting State  Farm to  propose other  orthope-\n\ndists,  and inquiring  why  the IME  could  not be  conducted  in\n\nFlorida  where VanHaaren  was  again residing.   Otherwise,  Van-\n\nHaaren's counsel suggested, State Farm \"may bring a motion for an\n\nexamination in the [district court].\"   On January 10, 1992, over\n\nVanHaaren's  opposition, the  presiding magistrate  judge granted\n\nState  Farm's motion to compel VanHaaren to attend the IME sched-\n\nuled for January 14 in Portland.  VanHaaren complied.\n\n          In  May 1992  the district  court granted  State Farm's\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment  on the  ground  that  VanHaaren's\n\nconduct  before and after filing suit constituted a breach of the\n\n                                3\n\nIME clause, barring recovery  under the uninsured motorist provi-\n\nsion in the State Farm policy.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

Breach of IME Clause\n                        \n\n          VanHaaren nevertheless contends that State  Farm failed\n\nto  establish beyond  reasonable disputation the  other essential\n\nelement of  its defense     that he  breached the  IME clause  by\n\n\"refusing\" to comply with State Farm's reasonable IME requests.\n\n                    \n\n     3The district court opinion could not have been more clear:\n\n     The plaintiff,  however, does not argue  that the court\n     must  find  prejudice  resulting  from  his  failure to\n     submit to an IME  upon request in order to  relieve the\n     defendant of its obligation  to him under the uninsured\n     motorist provisions of the policy.  Nor does he contest\n     the defendant's  assertion that the amount  of time and\n     money  spent  by State  Farm to  secure  an IME  of the\n     plaintiff constitutes prejudice.  He simply argues that\n     any expenses incurred by State Farm are a result of its\n     failure to cooperate with him.\n\n                                8\n\n          As  a  general  rule,  whether  there  was  substantial\n\ncompliance with a condition precedent in an insurance contract is\n\na question of fact ill-suited to disposition on summary judgment.\n\nSee,  e.g., Piro,  514 N.E.2d  at 1234  (noting that  whether the\n                \n\ninsured provided  necessary information \"too late\"  normally is a\n\nquestion  for  the factfinder).   Under  Maine  law, even  if the\n\ninsurer  suffers  appreciable  prejudice  from  the  breach,  the\n\ninsured  may still  quell  the insurer's  affirmative defense  by\n\nproffering a  valid excuse  or justification  for the  failure or\n\nrefusal to comply.

We also  reasoned that it\n                            \n\nwas significant that  the failure to follow the  district court's\n\norders was  due to counsel's mistakes rather  to any bad faith on\n\nthe part of plaintiffs.  Id. \n                            \n\n          Here, thus  far  the record  reveals  that  VanHaaren's\n\ncounsel, rather  than VanHaaren himself,  acted in  bad faith  in\n\nrefusing State Farm's repeated  IME requests.  It  seems to me  a\n\nrather drastic and tragic remedy to dispose adversely of \n\nVanHaaren's claim because  of the  conduct of his  attorney.   Of\n\ncourse, it  may very well be  that VanHaaren himself knew  of the\n\nIME  requests, and himself refused to  comply with them.  If that\n\nis the case, then summary  judgment in favor of State  Farm would\n\nbe appropriate.  But, at the very least, the district court ought\n\nto hold a  hearing to determine whether  VanHaaren bears personal\n\nresponsibility for the actions of his counsel.  If VanHaaren does\n                                                                 \n\nnot bear personal  responsibility, and if  failure to respond  to\n   \n\nthe IME requests was due simply to dereliction on the part of his\n\ncounsel, then the court  ought to consider a less  drastic remedy\n\nthan  to dispose  adversely  of his  action.   One  such  remedy,\n\npursuant  to Velazquez and Dunbar  might be in  the form of sanc-\n                                 \n\n                                18\n\ntions  imposed or  personal  costs  assessed against  VanHaaren's\n\ncounsel.\n\n          For the foregoing  reasons I respectfully dissent  from\n\nthe judgment of the court.\n\n                                19\n</pre>",
