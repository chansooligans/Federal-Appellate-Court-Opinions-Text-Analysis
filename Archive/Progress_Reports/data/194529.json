Defendant-appellant Paul J.\n                               \n\nCastellone pled guilty to a two-count information in which he\n\nwas charged  with distribution of marijuana,  in violation of\n\n21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1).  He  was sentenced  to 21  months of\n\nimprisonment and three years of  supervised release.  In this\n\nappeal,  Castellone challenges  his sentence  on two  grounds\n\nrelated to  the district  court's calculation of  the offense\n\nlevel assigned to  his conviction.   Specifically,  defendant\n\nargues:  1) that  the court erroneously included as  relevant\n\nconduct certain amounts of marijuana sold by a coconspirator;\n\nand  2) that  the court  should not  have ascribed  to him  a\n\nmanagerial role in the  offense.  As we find  these arguments\n\npersuasive, and the government has candidly made us aware  of\n\nan  apparent   mathematical  error   in  the   offense  level\n\ncalculation, we remand for resentencing.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          Because  Castellone  pled  guilty,  we  garner  the\n\nrelevant  facts from  the  probation  officer's  Pre-Sentence\n\nReport (PSR)  and the  transcript of the  sentencing hearing.\n\nUnited States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1992).  In\n                       \n\nearly   January   1992,  Detective   Michael  Purro   of  the\n\nProvidence,   Rhode  Island,   Police  Department   began  an\n\nundercover   investigation   of   marijuana  trafficking   by\n\nCastellone  and Roland R. Chaput.   Purro was  assisted by an\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nagent  from  the  federal  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms.\n\n          On  January  9,  1992,  Detective  Purro,  in   his\n\nundercover  capacity, purchased  one pound of  marijuana from\n\nCastellone  for $2,200  (\"the first  sale\").   The next  day,\n\nPurro purchased  another pound  of marijuana  from Castellone\n\nfor  the same  price (\"the  second sale\").   Both  sales took\n\nplace in the late afternoon at a Dunkin Donuts on East Street\n\nin Providence.   Prior  to the  second  sale, Purro  followed\n\nCastellone  to the  Dunkin  Donuts parking  lot and  observed\n\nChaput  arrive  and  enter  Castellone's  car.    Purro  then\n\napproached  Castellone's  vehicle   and  introduced   himself\n\ndirectly to Chaput, whom he believed, correctly, as it  later\n\nturned out, to be Castellone's supplier.\n\n          At some point between January 10 and 16, Castellone\n\nand Purro discussed  a sale of five pounds of marijuana and a\n\nhandgun.  Castellone told  Purro that he had been  in contact\n\nwith Chaput and would be able to execute the sale.  Since law\n\nenforcement officials  considered Chaput to be a higher-level\n\ndealer and a more important target than Castellone, Detective\n\nPurro decided  to exclude  Castellone from any  future deals,\n\nand  instead  buy  directly  from Chaput.    After  obtaining\n\nChaput's  phone number from  a confidential  informant, Purro\n\ncontacted him and after discussion was offered five pounds of\n\nmarijuana for $1700 per pound (\"the third sale\").  Castellone\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nwas totally unaware of  the third sale or the  direct contact\n\nbetween Purro and Chaput.\n\n          On January  16, 1992, at  approximately 6:30  p.m.,\n\nChaput,  Purro, and two other men, Robert Laiter and Peter M.\n\nLeite, all arrived at the Dunkin Donuts in separate vehicles.\n\nChaput retrieved a handgun from Laiter's car and delivered it\n\nto  Purro.   Chaput, Laiter  and Leite  were all  arrested as\n\nChaput was removing the marijuana  from the trunk of  Leite's\n\ncar.   Law enforcement agents found  five, approximately one-\n\npound packages of marijuana in the trunk.1\n\n          Castellone was  not present at the  third sale, but\n\nwas later  arrested pursuant to  a warrant.   He subsequently\n\nagreed to plead  guilty to an  information charging him  with\n\nthe first two marijuana deals.   He also agreed to assist the\n\ngovernment  in its  attempts  to arrest  others  in the  drug\n\ntrade.  In  return for his cooperation, the government agreed\n\nnot to charge him with  conspiring with Chaput to  distribute\n\nmarijuana.  The plea agreement also indicated that the weight\n\nof the two sales  to which Castellone was pleading  was 908.7\n\ngrams.   Moreover, the government agreed it would not seek to\n\nhold  Castellone responsible  at sentencing  for the  2,300.3\n\ngrams  or the firearm seized at the January 16, 1992, arrest.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The total weight of the five packages was  2,300.3 grams.\nAs  a  pound  contains  454 grams,  the  contraband  slightly\nexceeded five pounds.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nFinally, the government agreed to recommend a sentence at the\n\nlow end of the applicable guideline range.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Sentencing\n                                    \n\n          In  calculating  Castellone's  base  offense  level\n\n(\"BOL\"), the probation officer used a total quantity  of 3209\n\ngrams  of marijuana.  This  amount included the 2,300.3 grams\n\nChaput  delivered to Purro at the third  sale, as well as the\n\n908.7 grams  Castellone sold directly  to Purro at  the first\n\ntwo sales.  Applying the Sentencing Guidelines' Drug Quantity\n\nTable, U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c), the probation officer tabulated a\n\nBOL of 12, applicable to  quantities of marijuana between 2.5\n\nand five  kilograms.  The BOL was increased by two levels for\n\nCastellone's  managerial  role  in the  offense,  U.S.S.G.   \n\n3B1.1(c),  and  decreased by  two  levels  for acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility.     After  assigning  Castellone  a  criminal\n\nhistory category  of I, the probation  officer concluded that\n\nCastellone's offense level was 12, with a resulting guideline\n\nrange of 10 to 16 months.\n\n          Prior to  sentencing,  Castellone objected  to  the\n\ninclusion of  the 2300.3  grams of  marijuana from  the third\n\nsale  as  relevant  conduct,  as  well  as  to  the two-level\n\nadjustment for a managerial role in the offense.   At the May\n\n19, 1992, sentencing hearing, the defense put Detective Purro\n\non  the  stand to  testify  about,  inter alia,  Castellone's\n                                              \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ninvolvement--or  lack thereof--in  the  third sale.   At  the\n\nclose  of the hearing, the trial court expressed concern over\n\nwhat  it   thought  to   be  an  inconsistency   between  the\n\ngovernment's plea agreement obligation not to hold Castellone\n\nresponsible for  the third sale, and  the probation officer's\n\nstatement  that in  response to  Castellone's objection,  the\n\ngovernment  was  prepared   to  present  evidence   regarding\n\nCastellone's role in the third sale.   Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt gave  Castellone the  option of withdrawing  his guilty\n\nplea.    Castellone  declined,  and  the  sentencing  hearing\n\nreconvened   on  June  15,  1992,  whereupon  the  government\n\nreiterated   its   position   that  defendant   was   legally\n\nresponsible only for  the 908.7 grams  of marijuana from  the\n\nfirst  two  sales.     The  court,  however,  questioned  the\n\ngovernment's  decision  to  forego  inclusion of  the  2300.3\n\ngrams.  In response, the government cited the plea agreement,\n\nwhich,  in turn, was based on its conclusion that the element\n\nof  foreseeability of  the  third  sale,  as  it  related  to\n\nCastellone, was \"questionable.\"  The trial court then ordered\n\nfurther testimony from  Purro, to elaborate on what,  if any,\n\nnexus   existed   between   Purro   and   Castellone's   last\n\nconversation and the third sale. \n\n          Following Purro's testimony, and  defense argument,\n\nthe court found that Castellone initiated the third  sale and\n\nthat  he  took two  actions in  furtherance  of that  sale by\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ninitiating the negotiations  with Purro and by  communicating\n\nPurro's  marijuana and  handgun order  to  Chaput.   Based on\n\nthose  findings,   the  court  ruled  that   the  third  sale\n\nconstituted relevant conduct  for which Castellone  should be\n\nheld responsible.\n\n          Next, having heard argument  regarding Castellone's\n\nrole in the  offense, the trial court found that Castellone's\n\nnegotiations  in the first  two sales and  involvement in the\n\nthird supported  an offense  level increase for  a managerial\n\nrole.  Castellone appeals these two findings.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          At the outset, we  note that remand is in  order to\n\ncorrect   an  apparent  mathematical   error  in  calculating\n\nCastellone's offense level,  irrespective of our decision  on\n\nthe  merits  of   the  trial  court's  findings.2    A  brief\n\nexplanation follows.\n\n          The court found that  the third sale, involving the\n\n2300.3  grams  of marijuana  and  the  handgun, was  relevant\n\nconduct  for  purposes  of  determining  Castellone's offense\n\nlevel.    As noted,  supra, p.  3,  this amount  of marijuana\n                          \n\nyielded a  BOL of 12.   The firearm added two  levels, to 14.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although Castellone failed to raise this  argument before\nthe trial  court, we do  have jurisdiction  to correct  plain\nerror.  United States v. Morales-Diaz, 925 F.2d 535, 539 (1st\n                                     \nCir. 1991).\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1).3   The court's ruling on Castellone's\n\nmanagerial  role  added  two  more levels,  resulting  in  an\n\nadjusted offense level of 16.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).  Finally,\n\nthe court agreed that Castellone was entitled to a  two-level\n\nreduction for  his acceptance  of responsibility, U.S.S.G.   \n\n3E1.1(a),  suggesting an  offense  level of  14, which,  when\n\ncoupled  with  a  criminal   history  category  I,  yields  a\n\nsentencing range of 15  to 21 months. U.S.S.G.    5, Part  A,\n\nSentencing Table.  The court, however, after factoring in the\n\nrelevant conduct, erroneously began  with an offense level of\n\n18, which it  reduced to 16 based on  Castellone's acceptance\n\nof  responsibility.    Thereafter, consistent  with  the plea\n\nagreement,  the  trial  court  sentenced  Castellone  at  the\n\nlenient end of the 21 to 27 month range called for by offense\n\nlevel  16.   While we  might assume  that the  district court\n\nwould again follow the plea agreement and sentence Castellone\n\nto the bottom end of the corrected guideline range, our other\n\nrulings relative  to the  instant sentence require  remand of\n\n                    \n\n3.  The PSR  omitted reference to  the firearm, and  thus did\nnot account for the two-point  upward adjustment.  The  trial\ncourt, however, explicitly found that the gun, as part of the\nthird sale, was relevant conduct  attributable to Castellone.\nWhile Castellone does not  specifically appeal the  propriety\nof  the handgun increase, he  did object to  and has appealed\nthe  inclusion of  the  third sale.    The handgun  increase,\ntherefore, succeeds or fails concomitant with the third sale,\nwithout meriting separate discussion.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nthis item  as well.4   We turn now to  the substantive issues\n\non appeal.\n\nA.  Relevant Conduct--The Third Sale\n                                    \n\n          Pursuant to  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c), the  BOL for drug\n\ntrafficking offenses  depends on  the quantity of  contraband\n\nattributable to the defendant.  For sentencing purposes, this\n\ntotal  includes  the amount  to  which  the defendant  pleads\n\nguilty, as well as any  relevant uncharged conduct.   Garcia,\n                                                            \n\n954 F.2d at 15  (citations omitted).  \"[D]rugs not  specified\n\nin  the count of conviction are to be included in determining\n\nthe offense  level if they  were part  of the same  course of\n\nconduct or  part of a common  scheme or plan as  the count of\n\nconviction.\"   U.S.S.G.    1B1.3, comment. (background).   In\n\ncases  involving  drug  conspiracies,  relevant  conduct also\n\nincludes \"all reasonably  foreseeable acts  and omissions  of\n\nothers  in  furtherance  of\"  the  conspiracy.    U.S.S.G.   \n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B); Garcia, 954 F.2d  at 15.  In order  to factor\n                      \n\nthe  quantities  associated with  relevant  conduct into  the\n\nsentencing  formula,  the  government  must  establish  by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence  that a sufficient nexus exists\n\nbetween the conduct  at issue and the  offense of conviction.\n\nUnited  States v. Sklar, 920  F.2d 107, 110  (1st Cir. 1990).\n                       \n\n                    \n\n4.  Because  of  our  decision  today,  the low  end  of  the\napplicable  guideline  range  may  lead  to  a  sentence  not\ninvolving  incarceration.   We  leave  that  decision to  the\ndistrict court.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nWe will set aside  the district court's findings  on relevant\n\nconduct only if they are clearly erroneous.  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nCamuti, 950 F.2d 72, 74 (1st Cir. 1991).\n      \n\n          As he  did below,  Castellone argues here  that the\n\ngovernment's  decision to \"cut him out\" of the third sale and\n\ndeal directly  with Chaput  without his  knowledge inoculates\n\nhim  from responsibility for the  sale.  Castellone bases his\n\nargument  on  the following  undisputed facts.   Castellone's\n\nrelationship  with Purro was  severed after  only preliminary\n\nconversations  relative to  the  third sale  wherein the  two\n\nnever agreed  that a sale would take place, or on a price for\n\nsuch  a sale.   Furthermore,  due to  his own  profit motive,\n\nCastellone did  not want Purro to deal  directly with Chaput,\n\ndid not know Purro was going to do so, and  did not know that\n\nthe third sale had occurred until after his arrest.  \n\n          The trial court, however, found that Castellone and\n\nChaput  had formed a  conspiracy to sell  marijuana, and that\n\nCastellone initiated  the negotiation for the  third sale and\n\ncommunicated Purro's third sale request to Chaput.  The court\n\nthen determined that  the third sale was both  foreseeable to\n\nCastellone and in furtherance  of the conspiracy.  Therefore,\n\nthe trial court  concluded that the  third sale was  relevant\n\nconduct for purposes  of sentence calculation.   Based on the\n\nfollowing, we disagree.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          In analyzing  this situation,  we find that  two of\n\nour  recent decisions offer  direction.  In  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nWood,  924  F.2d  399  (1st Cir.  1991),  the  defendant  was\n    \n\nconvicted of one narcotics sale.  At sentencing, the district\n\ncourt placed  additional, uncharged  sales into the  relevant\n\nconduct category.   We ruled  that an uncharged  sale between\n\ndefendant's wife and  a drug supplier, of which the defendant\n\nhad  no  knowledge  until  after  the  fact,   could  not  be\n\nconsidered relevant conduct for  sentencing purposes.  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n404-05.   We  rested  our  decision  on  the  fact  that  the\n\ndefendant  \"in  no  way  conspired to  facilitate  the  deal;\n\nindeed, he had no knowledge that his wife was engaged in drug\n\ntransactions   with   anyone   other   than   himself.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nSubsequently,  we  upheld  a  district  court's  decision  to\n\ninclude   as   relevant  conduct   drug  sales   between  the\n\ndefendant's  coconspirator and  an undercover  agent, despite\n\nthe  fact that the  defendant was not  personally involved in\n\nthe later sales.  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 16-17.   A fair reading\n                        \n\nof  Garcia, however,  indicates  that the  defendant and  his\n          \n\ncoconspirator   worked  as  a  team  to  sell  drugs  to  the\n\nundercover officer.  As we noted:\n\n           \"Garcia introduced [his coconspirator to\n                                                   \n          the  undercover  agent]  for the  express\n                                 \n          purpose     of      facilitating     drug\n          transactions.  He was aware of the nature\n                                                   \n          and salient details  of the  relationship\n                                                   \n          that  developed  between  the   two  men.\n                                                   \n          There   was   no  evidence   of  Garcia's\n          affirmative    withdrawal     from    the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          conspiracy  or  of any  other intervening\n                                                   \n          event     materially    affecting     the\n                                                   \n          trafficking calculus.\"  \n                               \n\nId. at 16 (emphasis added).  We stated that \"the measure of a\n   \n\ndefendant's  accountability for drug transactions in which he\n\nwas  not personally  involved is  usually congruent  with the\n\nscope of  his agreement with  the other  participants in  the\n\nenterprise.\"     Id.  (citation   omitted).     We  therefore\n                    \n\ndistinguished  Wood  on the  ground that  \"Garcia's agreement\n                   \n\nwith  his  coconspirator  []  could  reasonably  be  said  to\n\ntranscend the initial series of transactions.\"  Id. \n                                                   \n\n          Here, with  Wood and  Garcia as our  guideposts, we\n                                      \n\nfind that Castellone was sufficiently detached from the third\n\nsale  so that it stands alone, and  not as part of an overall\n\ncourse of  conduct.  Based  on our  review of the  record, we\n\ndoubt whether  Castellone could have foreseen  that the third\n\nsale, about which  he knew  nothing, would take  place as  it\n\ndid,  from  Chaput  directly  to  Purro.   And  although  the\n\nevidence  supports  the   district  court's  conclusion  that\n\nCastellone  and  Chaput  had  formed  a  conspiracy  to  sell\n\nmarijuana,  there is no evidence  that the third  sale was in\n\nfurtherance of  a common plan between  Castellone and Chaput.\n\nJust as the defendant in Wood  had no knowledge that his wife\n                             \n\ndealt  with anybody  but  him, Castellone  had  no reason  to\n\nexpect Purro to  deal directly  with Chaput.   The record  is\n\nclear  that Castellone  was little  more than  a street-level\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n\"retail\" dealer, and that Chaput was his \"wholesaler,\" rather\n\nthan  his  partner.   This  conclusion  is  supported by  the\n\ncircumstances  of the  first  two sales,  wherein  Castellone\n\nbought  marijuana from  Chaput, and  sold it  to Purro  for a\n\nseveral hundred dollar profit.5   As for the third  sale, the\n\nrecord  does not  support the  trial court's  conclusion that\n\nCastellone  initiated  the negotiations.    Purro's testimony\n\nindicated  only that  the two  \"had communication\"  after the\n\nsecond sale, but is  silent as to the instigator.   Moreover,\n\nwhile  the record  does support  the finding  that Castellone\n\ntold Chaput  of Purro's  interest in another  sale, there  is\n\nnothing in the  record to indicate that  Castellone's call to\n\nChaput  was anything  other than part  of the  previous modus\n                                                             \n\noperandi.  In other  words, after Purro made the  request for\n        \n\nmore marijuana and a gun, Castellone attempted to accommodate\n\nhim  by contacting  his supplier.   There  is nothing  in the\n\nrecord  to  indicate that  Castellone's  call  to Chaput  was\n\nintended to facilitate the Chaput-Purro transaction.  Indeed,\n\nsuch   a  conclusion   defies  logic,   because   the  record\n\ndemonstrates  that  Castellone's  only  source  of narcotics-\n\nrelated income  was his own  \"retail\" operation.   Unlike the\n\ndefendant in Garcia, Castellone  was in business for himself.\n                   \n\nAlso   unlike  the  scenario   in  Garcia,  Castellone  never\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n5.  The  exact amount  of  Castellone's  per-pound profit  is\ndisputed.      Resolution   of   that   issue,   however,  is\ninsignificant to our analysis.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nintroduced Purro to  Chaput.   Had events  taken their  usual\n\ncourse, as Castellone had  every reason to expect, Castellone\n\nwould  have  again  purchased  the  contraband  from  Chaput,\n\nfactored in a profit,  and re-sold it to Purro.   Castellone,\n\nhowever, never again discussed the sale with Purro, as he had\n\nbeen,  unbeknownst to  him, bypassed.   This  is akin  to the\n\n\"intervening  event\" adverted to in  Garcia.  Thus, there was\n                                           \n\nno evidence from which the court could properly find that the\n\nthird sale  was in furtherance  of a common  scheme involving\n\nCastellone  and Chaput.   Accordingly,  we find  the district\n\ncourt's inclusion of the third sale as relevant conduct to be\n\nclearly erroneous.6\n\nB.  The Managerial Role\n                       \n\n          Despite  entreaties  from  both  the   defense  and\n\ngovernment, the trial  court assessed Castellone a  two-level\n\nincrease in  his BOL  for his role  as a manager  of criminal\n\nactivity  pursuant to U.S.S.G   3B1.1(c).  Upon review of the\n\nrecord, we find this increase legally insupportable.\n\n          At the  outset, we  note that the  government bears\n\nthe  burden   of  proving  that  an   upward  adjustment  was\n\nwarranted.   United States v.  Ortiz, 966 F.2d  707, 717 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1992), cert.  denied, 61 U.S.L.W.  3479 (U.S.  Jan. 11,\n                          \n\n                    \n\n6.  We are not  unmindful of  our recent  decision in  United\n                                                             \nStates  v.  Moran,  No.  91-1772  (1st  Cir.  Jan 20,  1993).\n                 \nHowever, we  view the  facts of this  case quite  differently\nthan those in Moran.\n                   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n1993) (No. 92-6552).  To meet its burden, the government must\n\ndemonstrate that Castellone exercised \"some degree of control\n\nover others involved in  the commission of the offense  or he\n\nmust  have been  responsible  for organizing  others for  the\n\npurpose of carrying out the crime.\"  United States v. Fuller,\n                                                            \n\n897  F.2d  1217, 1220  (1st Cir.  1990).   Here, we  find the\n\nrecord devoid  of evidence  of such control  or organization.\n\nOn appeal, the  government argues that Castellone  determined\n\nwho purchased, when and  where sales took place, prices,  and\n\nprofit.  Thus,   the  argument  goes,   it  was  Castellone's\n\ndecisions on those matters  that effectuated his control over\n\nwhen and where Chaput and  others presented themselves.  With\n\nrespect to  the first part of  the argument, the  same can be\n\nsaid of  any independent, street-level  dealer.  In  fact, no\n\nstreet-level drug sale could ever be made without a customer,\n\na time and  location for the sale, and a price.  Furthermore,\n\nthe profit  Castellone determined was his  own, not Chaput's.\n\nMoreover, the second part of the argument is unsubstantiated.\n\nThere  is simply  no evidence  that Castellone  exercised any\n\ncontrol  over the  movement of  Chaput--or  anyone else.   In\n\nruling in favor of the increase, the trial court stated:\n\n          It's  not necessary that a [d]efendant be\n          the  CEO  of the  operation  to  be in  a\n          managerial  role.    Here,  there  is  no\n          question    but   that    the   Defendant\n          negotiated the first two transactions and\n          began  the  negotiations  for  the  third\n          transaction, and along  with Mr.  Chaput,\n          the  transactions were  carried out.   It\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          seems to me  those facts  do establish  a\n          managerial role on his part. . . .\n\nConspicuously lacking from the  court's analysis, however, is\n\nany finding  that Castellone  organized or  exercised control\n\nover  others--that  is,  that  he \"managed\"  or  \"organized,\"\n\nwithin the meaning  of section 3B1.1(c).7   We have  recently\n\nstated that an upward  BOL adjustment \"must be based  on more\n\nthan  the  trial  judge's  hunch, no  matter  how  sound  his\n\ninstincts or how  sagacious his judgment.\"   Ortiz, 966  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n707, 717 (1st Cir. 1992).  The evidence in this case does not\n\nsupport such an adjustment.\n\n          Appellant's  sentence  is vacated  and the  case is\n                                                             \n\nremanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance\n                                                             \n\nwith this opinion.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n7.  By  comparison, Chaput,  who  also  received a  two-level\nmanagerial   role   adjustment,   was   accompanied   by  his\nsubordinates at the third sale.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n",

In\n                       \n\nearly   January   1992,  Detective   Michael  Purro   of  the\n\nProvidence,   Rhode  Island,   Police  Department   began  an\n\nundercover   investigation   of   marijuana  trafficking   by\n\nCastellone  and Roland R. Chaput.   Purro was  assisted by an\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nagent  from  the  federal  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms.\n\n          On  January  9,  1992,  Detective  Purro,  in   his\n\nundercover  capacity, purchased  one pound of  marijuana from\n\nCastellone  for $2,200  (\"the first  sale\").   The next  day,\n\nPurro purchased  another pound  of marijuana  from Castellone\n\nfor  the same  price (\"the  second sale\").   Both  sales took\n\nplace in the late afternoon at a Dunkin Donuts on East Street\n\nin Providence.   Prior  to the  second  sale, Purro  followed\n\nCastellone  to the  Dunkin  Donuts parking  lot and  observed\n\nChaput  arrive  and  enter  Castellone's  car.    Purro  then\n\napproached  Castellone's  vehicle   and  introduced   himself\n\ndirectly to Chaput, whom he believed, correctly, as it  later\n\nturned out, to be Castellone's supplier.\n\n          At some point between January 10 and 16, Castellone\n\nand Purro discussed  a sale of five pounds of marijuana and a\n\nhandgun.  Castellone told  Purro that he had been  in contact\n\nwith Chaput and would be able to execute the sale.  Since law\n\nenforcement officials  considered Chaput to be a higher-level\n\ndealer and a more important target than Castellone, Detective\n\nPurro decided  to exclude  Castellone from any  future deals,\n\nand  instead  buy  directly  from Chaput.    After  obtaining\n\nChaput's  phone number from  a confidential  informant, Purro\n\ncontacted him and after discussion was offered five pounds of\n\nmarijuana for $1700 per pound (\"the third sale\").  Castellone\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nwas totally unaware of  the third sale or the  direct contact\n\nbetween Purro and Chaput.\n\n          On January  16, 1992, at  approximately 6:30  p.m.,\n\nChaput,  Purro, and two other men, Robert Laiter and Peter M.\n\nLeite, all arrived at the Dunkin Donuts in separate vehicles.\n\nChaput retrieved a handgun from Laiter's car and delivered it\n\nto  Purro.   Chaput, Laiter  and Leite  were all  arrested as\n\nChaput was removing the marijuana  from the trunk of  Leite's\n\ncar.   Law enforcement agents found  five, approximately one-\n\npound packages of marijuana in the trunk.1\n\n          Castellone was  not present at the  third sale, but\n\nwas later  arrested pursuant to  a warrant.   He subsequently\n\nagreed to plead  guilty to an  information charging him  with\n\nthe first two marijuana deals.   He also agreed to assist the\n\ngovernment  in its  attempts  to arrest  others  in the  drug\n\ntrade.  In  return for his cooperation, the government agreed\n\nnot to charge him with  conspiring with Chaput to  distribute\n\nmarijuana.  The plea agreement also indicated that the weight\n\nof the two sales  to which Castellone was pleading  was 908.7\n\ngrams.   Moreover, the government agreed it would not seek to\n\nhold  Castellone responsible  at sentencing  for the  2,300.3\n\ngrams  or the firearm seized at the January 16, 1992, arrest.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The total weight of the five packages was  2,300.3 grams.\nAs  a  pound  contains  454 grams,  the  contraband  slightly\nexceeded five pounds.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nFinally, the government agreed to recommend a sentence at the\n\nlow end of the applicable guideline range.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Sentencing\n                                    \n\n          In  calculating  Castellone's  base  offense  level\n\n(\"BOL\"), the probation officer used a total quantity  of 3209\n\ngrams  of marijuana.  This  amount included the 2,300.3 grams\n\nChaput  delivered to Purro at the third  sale, as well as the\n\n908.7 grams  Castellone sold directly  to Purro at  the first\n\ntwo sales.  Applying the Sentencing Guidelines' Drug Quantity\n\nTable, U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c), the probation officer tabulated a\n\nBOL of 12, applicable to  quantities of marijuana between 2.5\n\nand five  kilograms.  The BOL was increased by two levels for\n\nCastellone's  managerial  role  in the  offense,  U.S.S.G.   \n\n3B1.1(c),  and  decreased by  two  levels  for acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility.     After  assigning  Castellone  a  criminal\n\nhistory category  of I, the probation  officer concluded that\n\nCastellone's offense level was 12, with a resulting guideline\n\nrange of 10 to 16 months.\n\n          Prior to  sentencing,  Castellone objected  to  the\n\ninclusion of  the 2300.3  grams of  marijuana from  the third\n\nsale  as  relevant  conduct,  as  well  as  to  the two-level\n\nadjustment for a managerial role in the offense.   At the May\n\n19, 1992, sentencing hearing, the defense put Detective Purro\n\non  the  stand to  testify  about,  inter alia,  Castellone's\n                                              \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ninvolvement--or  lack thereof--in  the  third sale.   At  the\n\nclose  of the hearing, the trial court expressed concern over\n\nwhat  it   thought  to   be  an  inconsistency   between  the\n\ngovernment's plea agreement obligation not to hold Castellone\n\nresponsible for  the third sale, and  the probation officer's\n\nstatement  that in  response to  Castellone's objection,  the\n\ngovernment  was  prepared   to  present  evidence   regarding\n\nCastellone's role in the third sale.   Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt gave  Castellone the  option of withdrawing  his guilty\n\nplea.    Castellone  declined,  and  the  sentencing  hearing\n\nreconvened   on  June  15,  1992,  whereupon  the  government\n\nreiterated   its   position   that  defendant   was   legally\n\nresponsible only for  the 908.7 grams  of marijuana from  the\n\nfirst  two  sales.     The  court,  however,  questioned  the\n\ngovernment's  decision  to  forego  inclusion of  the  2300.3\n\ngrams.  In response, the government cited the plea agreement,\n\nwhich,  in turn, was based on its conclusion that the element\n\nof  foreseeability of  the  third  sale,  as  it  related  to\n\nCastellone, was \"questionable.\"  The trial court then ordered\n\nfurther testimony from  Purro, to elaborate on what,  if any,\n\nnexus   existed   between   Purro   and   Castellone's   last\n\nconversation and the third sale. \n\n          Following Purro's testimony, and  defense argument,\n\nthe court found that Castellone initiated the third  sale and\n\nthat  he  took two  actions in  furtherance  of that  sale by\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ninitiating the negotiations  with Purro and by  communicating\n\nPurro's  marijuana and  handgun order  to  Chaput.   Based on\n\nthose  findings,   the  court  ruled  that   the  third  sale\n\nconstituted relevant conduct  for which Castellone  should be\n\nheld responsible.\n\n          Next, having heard argument  regarding Castellone's\n\nrole in the  offense, the trial court found that Castellone's\n\nnegotiations  in the first  two sales and  involvement in the\n\nthird supported  an offense  level increase for  a managerial\n\nrole.  Castellone appeals these two findings.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          At the outset, we  note that remand is in  order to\n\ncorrect   an  apparent  mathematical   error  in  calculating\n\nCastellone's offense level,  irrespective of our decision  on\n\nthe  merits  of   the  trial  court's  findings.2    A  brief\n\nexplanation follows.\n\n          The court found that  the third sale, involving the\n\n2300.3  grams  of marijuana  and  the  handgun, was  relevant\n\nconduct  for  purposes  of  determining  Castellone's offense\n\nlevel.    As noted,  supra, p.  3,  this amount  of marijuana\n                          \n\nyielded a  BOL of 12.   The firearm added two  levels, to 14.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although Castellone failed to raise this  argument before\nthe trial  court, we do  have jurisdiction  to correct  plain\nerror.  United States v.

U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).  Finally,\n\nthe court agreed that Castellone was entitled to a  two-level\n\nreduction for  his acceptance  of responsibility, U.S.S.G.   \n\n3E1.1(a),  suggesting an  offense  level of  14, which,  when\n\ncoupled  with  a  criminal   history  category  I,  yields  a\n\nsentencing range of 15  to 21 months. U.S.S.G.    5, Part  A,\n\nSentencing Table.  The court, however, after factoring in the\n\nrelevant conduct, erroneously began  with an offense level of\n\n18, which it  reduced to 16 based on  Castellone's acceptance\n\nof  responsibility.    Thereafter, consistent  with  the plea\n\nagreement,  the  trial  court  sentenced  Castellone  at  the\n\nlenient end of the 21 to 27 month range called for by offense\n\nlevel  16.   While we  might assume  that the  district court\n\nwould again follow the plea agreement and sentence Castellone\n\nto the bottom end of the corrected guideline range, our other\n\nrulings relative  to the  instant sentence require  remand of\n\n                    \n\n3.  The PSR  omitted reference to  the firearm, and  thus did\nnot account for the two-point  upward adjustment.  The  trial\ncourt, however, explicitly found that the gun, as part of the\nthird sale, was relevant conduct  attributable to Castellone.\nWhile Castellone does not  specifically appeal the  propriety\nof  the handgun increase, he  did object to  and has appealed\nthe  inclusion of  the  third sale.

Castellone bases his\n\nargument  on  the following  undisputed facts.   Castellone's\n\nrelationship  with Purro was  severed after  only preliminary\n\nconversations  relative to  the  third sale  wherein the  two\n\nnever agreed  that a sale would take place, or on a price for\n\nsuch  a sale.   Furthermore,  due to  his own  profit motive,\n\nCastellone did  not want Purro to deal  directly with Chaput,\n\ndid not know Purro was going to do so, and  did not know that\n\nthe third sale had occurred until after his arrest.  \n\n          The trial court, however, found that Castellone and\n\nChaput  had formed a  conspiracy to sell  marijuana, and that\n\nCastellone initiated  the negotiation for the  third sale and\n\ncommunicated Purro's third sale request to Chaput.  The court\n\nthen determined that  the third sale was both  foreseeable to\n\nCastellone and in furtherance  of the conspiracy.  Therefore,\n\nthe trial court  concluded that the  third sale was  relevant\n\nconduct for purposes  of sentence calculation.

We ruled  that an uncharged  sale between\n\ndefendant's wife and  a drug supplier, of which the defendant\n\nhad  no  knowledge  until  after  the  fact,   could  not  be\n\nconsidered relevant conduct for  sentencing purposes.

We  rested  our  decision  on  the  fact  that  the\n\ndefendant  \"in  no  way  conspired to  facilitate  the  deal;\n\nindeed, he had no knowledge that his wife was engaged in drug\n\ntransactions   with   anyone   other   than   himself.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nSubsequently,  we  upheld  a  district  court's  decision  to\n\ninclude   as   relevant  conduct   drug  sales   between  the\n\ndefendant's  coconspirator and  an undercover  agent, despite\n\nthe  fact that the  defendant was not  personally involved in\n\nthe later sales.  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 16-17.   A fair reading\n                        \n\nof  Garcia, however,  indicates  that the  defendant and  his\n          \n\ncoconspirator   worked  as  a  team  to  sell  drugs  to  the\n\nundercover officer.  As we noted:\n\n           \"Garcia introduced [his coconspirator to\n                                                   \n          the  undercover  agent]  for the  express\n                                 \n          purpose     of      facilitating     drug\n          transactions.

We stated that \"the measure of a\n   \n\ndefendant's  accountability for drug transactions in which he\n\nwas  not personally  involved is  usually congruent  with the\n\nscope of  his agreement with  the other  participants in  the\n\nenterprise.\"     Id.  (citation   omitted).     We  therefore\n                    \n\ndistinguished  Wood  on the  ground that  \"Garcia's agreement\n                   \n\nwith  his  coconspirator  []  could  reasonably  be  said  to\n\ntranscend the initial series of transactions.\"  Id. \n                                                   \n\n          Here, with  Wood and  Garcia as our  guideposts, we\n                                      \n\nfind that Castellone was sufficiently detached from the third\n\nsale  so that it stands alone, and  not as part of an overall\n\ncourse of  conduct.  Based  on our  review of the  record, we\n\ndoubt whether  Castellone could have foreseen  that the third\n\nsale, about which  he knew  nothing, would take  place as  it\n\ndid,  from  Chaput  directly  to  Purro.   And  although  the\n\nevidence  supports  the   district  court's  conclusion  that\n\nCastellone  and  Chaput  had  formed  a  conspiracy  to  sell\n\nmarijuana,  there is no evidence  that the third  sale was in\n\nfurtherance of  a common plan between  Castellone and Chaput.\n\nJust as the defendant in Wood  had no knowledge that his wife\n                             \n\ndealt  with anybody  but  him, Castellone  had  no reason  to\n\nexpect Purro to  deal directly  with Chaput.   The record  is\n\nclear  that Castellone  was little  more than  a street-level\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n\"retail\" dealer, and that Chaput was his \"wholesaler,\" rather\n\nthan  his  partner.   This  conclusion  is  supported by  the\n\ncircumstances  of the  first  two sales,  wherein  Castellone\n\nbought  marijuana from  Chaput, and  sold it  to Purro  for a\n\nseveral hundred dollar profit.5   As for the third  sale, the\n\nrecord  does not  support the  trial court's  conclusion that\n\nCastellone  initiated  the negotiations.    Purro's testimony\n\nindicated  only that  the two  \"had communication\"  after the\n\nsecond sale, but is  silent as to the instigator.   Moreover,\n\nwhile  the record  does support  the finding  that Castellone\n\ntold Chaput  of Purro's  interest in another  sale, there  is\n\nnothing in the  record to indicate that  Castellone's call to\n\nChaput  was anything  other than part  of the  previous modus\n                                                             \n\noperandi.  In other  words, after Purro made the  request for\n        \n\nmore marijuana and a gun, Castellone attempted to accommodate\n\nhim  by contacting  his supplier.   There  is nothing  in the\n\nrecord  to  indicate that  Castellone's  call  to Chaput  was\n\nintended to facilitate the Chaput-Purro transaction.  Indeed,\n\nsuch   a  conclusion   defies  logic,   because   the  record\n\ndemonstrates  that  Castellone's  only  source  of narcotics-\n\nrelated income  was his own  \"retail\" operation.   Unlike the\n\ndefendant in Garcia, Castellone  was in business for himself.\n                   \n\nAlso   unlike  the  scenario   in  Garcia,  Castellone  never\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n5.  The  exact amount  of  Castellone's  per-pound profit  is\ndisputed.      Resolution   of   that   issue,   however,  is\ninsignificant to our analysis.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nintroduced Purro to  Chaput.   Had events  taken their  usual\n\ncourse, as Castellone had  every reason to expect, Castellone\n\nwould  have  again  purchased  the  contraband  from  Chaput,\n\nfactored in a profit,  and re-sold it to Purro.   Castellone,\n\nhowever, never again discussed the sale with Purro, as he had\n\nbeen,  unbeknownst to  him, bypassed.   This  is akin  to the\n\n\"intervening  event\" adverted to in  Garcia.  Thus, there was\n                                           \n\nno evidence from which the court could properly find that the\n\nthird sale  was in furtherance  of a common  scheme involving\n\nCastellone  and Chaput.   Accordingly,  we find  the district\n\ncourt's inclusion of the third sale as relevant conduct to be\n\nclearly erroneous.6\n\nB.  The Managerial Role\n                       \n\n          Despite  entreaties  from  both  the   defense  and\n\ngovernment, the trial  court assessed Castellone a  two-level\n\nincrease in  his BOL  for his role  as a manager  of criminal\n\nactivity  pursuant to U.S.S.G   3B1.1(c).  Upon review of the\n\nrecord, we find this increase legally insupportable.\n\n          At the  outset, we  note that the  government bears\n\nthe  burden   of  proving  that  an   upward  adjustment  was\n\nwarranted.

We are not  unmindful of  our recent  decision in  United\n                                                             \nStates  v.  Moran,  No.  91-1772  (1st  Cir.  Jan 20,  1993).\n                 \nHowever, we  view the  facts of this  case quite  differently\nthan those in Moran.\n                   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n1993) (No. 92-6552).  To meet its burden, the government must\n\ndemonstrate that Castellone exercised \"some degree of control\n\nover others involved in  the commission of the offense  or he\n\nmust  have been  responsible  for organizing  others for  the\n\npurpose of carrying out the crime.\"  United States v. Fuller,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537727\"><a href=\"/opinion/537727/united-states-v-leonard-r-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1220  (1st Cir.  1990).   Here, we  find the\n\nrecord devoid  of evidence  of such control  or organization.\n\nOn appeal, the  government argues that Castellone  determined\n\nwho purchased, when and  where sales took place, prices,  and\n\nprofit.  Thus,   the  argument  goes,   it  was  Castellone's\n\ndecisions on those matters  that effectuated his control over\n\nwhen and where Chaput and  others presented themselves.  With\n\nrespect to  the first part of  the argument, the  same can be\n\nsaid of  any independent, street-level  dealer.  In  fact, no\n\nstreet-level drug sale could ever be made without a customer,\n\na time and  location for the sale, and a price.  Furthermore,\n\nthe profit  Castellone determined was his  own, not Chaput's.\n\nMoreover, the second part of the argument is unsubstantiated.\n\nThere  is simply  no evidence  that Castellone  exercised any\n\ncontrol  over the  movement of  Chaput--or  anyone else.   In\n\nruling in favor of the increase, the trial court stated:\n\n          It's  not necessary that a [d]efendant be\n          the  CEO  of the  operation  to  be in  a\n          managerial  role.    Here,  there  is  no\n          question    but   that    the   Defendant\n          negotiated the first two transactions and\n          began  the  negotiations  for  the  third\n          transaction, and along  with Mr.  Chaput,\n          the  transactions were  carried out.   It\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          seems to me  those facts  do establish  a\n          managerial role on his part. . . .\n\nConspicuously lacking from the  court's analysis, however, is\n\nany finding  that Castellone  organized or  exercised control\n\nover  others--that  is,  that  he \"managed\"  or  \"organized,\"\n\nwithin the meaning  of section 3B1.1(c).7   We have  recently\n\nstated that an upward  BOL adjustment \"must be based  on more\n\nthan  the  trial  judge's  hunch, no  matter  how  sound  his\n\ninstincts or how  sagacious his judgment.\"   Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                  \n\n<span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717 (1st Cir. 1992).  The evidence in this case does not\n\nsupport such an adjustment.\n\n          Appellant's  sentence  is vacated  and the  case is\n                                                             \n\nremanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance\n                                                             \n\nwith this opinion.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n7.  By  comparison, Chaput,  who  also  received a  two-level\nmanagerial   role   adjustment,   was   accompanied   by  his\nsubordinates at the third sale.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n</pre>",
