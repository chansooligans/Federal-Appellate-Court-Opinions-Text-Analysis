Shane Devine, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                 \n\n                                        \n\n                           Before\n\n                    Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                       \n               Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                                            \n                 and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n                                         \n\n                                        \n\nWilliam A.  Hahn, by Appointment  of the Court,  with whom Hahn  &amp;\n                                                                 \nMatkov was on brief for appellant.\n \nJeffrey S. Cahill, Special Assistant United States Attorney,  with\n                \nwhom  Jeffrey  R. Howard,  United States  Attorney,  was on  brief for\n                   \nappellee. \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.    A  jury  convicted  the  appellant,\n                    \n\nEllerton Whitney,  of four  separate counts of  defrauding a\n\nbank, 18 U.S.C.   1344, and eight further separate counts of\n\nmaking false statements on bank loan applications, 18 U.S.C.\n\n   1014.  The court  sentenced Whitney to  serve three years\n\nimprisonment.   Whitney appeals both his  conviction and his\n\nsentence.\n\n          Whitney's  basic   claim,   in  respect   to   his\n\nconviction, is  that the government should  not have charged\n\nhim with so many different counts, arising out of what were,\n\nin  essence,  no  more   than  three  instances  of  related\n\nactivities -- activities consisting of (1) a series of false\n\nstatements that  he made on applications  for three separate\n\nbank loans from different  banks, and (2) the misuse  of the\n\nproceeds  of  one  of  these  loans  in  violation   of  the\n\napplicable  loan  agreement.    See  Blockburger  v.  United\n                                                            \n\nStates, 284 U.S. 299,  304 (1932) (double jeopardy violation\n      \n\nunless each offense charged requires proof of fact the other\n\ndoes not require).\n\n          We cannot consider Whitney's  multiplicity claims,\n\nhowever,  for he did not raise  them before trial.  Unless a\n\ndefendant raises these kinds  of objection to the indictment\n\nprior to  trial (while  time remains  for the  government to\n\nrewrite the indictment  to cure any  such error), he  waives\n\nthe  objection.  United States v. Faulhaber, 929 F.2d 16, 19\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1991), citing United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n809, 816-17 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          There are no special circumstances here that would\n\nwarrant departing from this \"waiver\" rule.  To the contrary,\n\nholding  Whitney  to  his  waiver  does  not  prejudice  him\n\nsignificantly.  Whitney says that, in respect to each of his\n\nthree efforts  to obtain money  from a bank,  the indictment\n\nshould  have  charged him,  at  most, with  either  a single\n\n  1014 count or a single    1344 count.  Had  the indictment\n\ndone  so,  however, his  eventual  sentence  would not  have\n\nchanged.    The  Sentencing  Guidelines,  in essence,  treat\n\ncounts  that cover closely related conduct as if they were a\n\nsingle count.  See U.S.S.G.   3D1.2 (closely  related counts\n                  \n\ngrouped  together if part of  single transaction).  And, the\n\nmaximum terms contained in the statutes here  at issue would\n\nhave permitted a three-year sentence were Whitney correct in\n\nhis  claims of  count multiplicity.   See  18 U.S.C.    1344\n                                         \n\n(thirty-year maximum); 18 U.S.C.   1014 (same).\n\n          Whitney  also  claims  that  the  court  committed\n\nseveral errors at  trial.  He  believes that the  prosecutor\n\nmade   improper  comments   in  his   opening   and  closing\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nstatements;  that a  prosecution witness improperly  gave an\n\nopinion  about a  legal conclusion  (about  what constitutes\n\n\"fraud\");  that  the  court  improperly failed  to  give  an\n\ninstruction about \"specific intent\" on the \"false statement\"\n\ncounts; that  the court, not  the jury, should  have decided\n\nwhether the  false statements were \"material;\"  and that the\n\nevidence   showed  different  fraudulent  loans  than  those\n\ncharged  in the indictment.  We cannot consider any of these\n\nclaims, however, for Whitney did not raise proper objections\n\nat  the time.  He concedes  that we can review these claimed\n\n\"errors\"  only to  see if  they are  \"plain\" enough  to have\n\nrequired  the judge  to take  corrective action  despite the\n\nfailure of any party to call the problem to his attention at\n\nthe time.  That  is to say, we must ask  whether or not they\n\namount to  errors which  constitute  \"manifest injustice.\"  \n\nSee United States  v. Santiago,  729 F.2d 38,  39 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1984); United  States  v. Griffin,  818  F.2d 97,  100  (1st\n                                 \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 484  U.S. 844 (1987) (plain errors  are\n                   \n\n\"so  shocking  that they  seriously  affect  the fundamental\n\nfairness and basic integrity of the proceedings conducted\").\n\nAfter reviewing  the record with  this standard in  mind, we\n\ncan find no such injustice.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          Finally,  Whitney  argues  that  his  sentence  is\n\nunlawful.   He  makes  several  claims,  one  of  which  the\n\nGovernment concedes.  The  district court applied the \"fraud\n\nloss\"  guideline  in  effect  in  1991,  the  time  of   the\n\nsentencing hearing.   Because  of an amendment  which became\n\neffective  November  1,  1989,  the  1991  version  of  this\n\nGuideline, U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b), is more severe than the same\n\nGuideline  as  it  existed   in  March  1989,  when  Whitney\n\ncommitted the crime.   Hence, the court should have  applied\n\nthe earlier, more lenient, Guideline.   See United States v.\n                                                         \n\nHarotunian,  920 F.2d 1040, 1041  (1st Cir. 1990).   We must\n          \n\ntherefore  vacate  Whitney's  sentence  and remand  for  re-\n\nsentencing.  Given the need for the new sentencing  hearing,\n\nwe  shall  not  consider  Whitney's  other  sentence-related\n\nclaims.   Rather, the district court  shall sentence Whitney\n\nafresh,  permitting both him and  the Government to make all\n\nsentence-related claims and arguments de novo.\n\n          The judgment of conviction is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n          The sentence is vacated  and the case remanded for\n                                                            \n\na new sentencing proceeding.\n                            \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n",

We must\n          \n\ntherefore  vacate  Whitney's  sentence  and remand  for  re-\n\nsentencing.  Given the need for the new sentencing  hearing,\n\nwe  shall  not  consider  Whitney's  other  sentence-related\n\nclaims.   Rather, the district court  shall sentence Whitney\n\nafresh,  permitting both him and  the Government to make all\n\nsentence-related claims and arguments de novo.\n\n          The judgment of conviction is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n          The sentence is vacated  and the case remanded for\n                                                            \n\na new sentencing proceeding.\n                            \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n</pre>",
