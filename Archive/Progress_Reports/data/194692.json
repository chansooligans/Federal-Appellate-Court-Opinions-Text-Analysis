The\n\nplaintiffs brought an  action in the  District Court of  the\n\nDistrict  of  Puerto  Rico   to  recover  damages  from  the\n\ndefendants for  injuries to  the plaintiff Rafaela  Trinidad\n\nDelgado resulting from exposure to cimetidine hydrochloride,\n\na  toxic  substance  used  in the  manufacture  of  Tagamet.\n\nTagamet was  manufactured by the plaintiff's  employer.  The\n\nother plaintiffs  are Mrs. Trinidad's husband and  son.  The\n\noriginal  defendants were  \"SK&amp;F  Lab Co.,  Smith Kline  and\n\nFrench - U.S., Smith Kline Beecham Mellon and or other Smith\n\nKline Corporation family and it insurers [sic].\"\n\n          Without challenge by the parties, the relationship\n\nof  the various  Smithkline  corporations was  found by  the\n\ndistrict judge to be as follows:  \n\n          Mrs. Trinidad's employer,  originally called  SK&amp;F\n\nLab Co.,  merged with  SK&amp;F Co.  to form  Smithkline Beecham\n\nPharmaceutical   Co.,  a   Delaware  corporation   with  its\n\nprincipal  place   of  business  in  Puerto   Rico.    (This\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\ncorporation   and  its   predecessors   were   referred   to\n\ncollectively by the court below as \"Pharmco,\" and we will do\n\nthe same.)   Pharmco is  a subsidiary of  SKB, Puerto  Rico,\n\nInc., a  holding company incorporated in  Delaware, and with\n\nits principal  place of business  there.  SKB,  Puerto Rico,\n\nInc.,   is  itself  a   subsidiary  of   Smithkline  Beecham\n\nCorporation (formerly Smithkline Beckman Corporation), which\n\nis a Pennsylvania corporation  having its principal place of\n\nbusiness in Pennsylvania.   There is no such corporation  as\n\nthe named defendant, Smithkline Beecham Mellon.    There are\n\ntwo other  corporations referred  to by the  district court,\n\nSmithkline and French  International Company and its  wholly\n\nowned   subsidiary,   Smithkline   &amp;  French   Interamerican\n\n(\"Interamerican\"), a Delaware corporation with its principal\n\nplace of business in Puerto Rico.  Interamerican  is engaged\n\nin  the sale  and distribution  of products  manufactured by\n\nPharmco. \n\n          Several months after the case was filed, and after\n\nthe  original  defendants   had  filed  their  answer,   the\n\nplaintiff moved to  amend the complaint by including  all of\n\nthe above named Smithkline  corporations as defendants.  The\n\nrecord reveals neither allowance  of this motion nor service\n\non the added defendants.   Nevertheless, after the filing of\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nthis  motion,  all  parties  and  the  court  treated  these\n\ncorporations  as properly before the court, at least for the\n\npurpose of presenting their  motions for summary judgment on\n\njurisdictional grounds  and to dismiss for  failure to state\n\nclaims  against certain  of the  defendants.   Counsel never\n\nfiled an  answer with respect  to the added  defendants, but\n\ndid  file a  motion to  dismiss or  for summary  judgment on\n\nbehalf  of  all  named  defendants.   For  purposes  of this\n\nappeal, we too will treat all parties as properly before the\n\ncourt.\n\n          About a month  after the motion to dismiss  or for\n\nsummary judgment was filed by the defendants, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion  under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  41(a) for  voluntary\n\ndismissal of Pharmco and Interamerican, the two corporations\n\nhaving their  principal places  of business in  Puerto Rico.\n\nThis motion  was filed  for the  avowed purpose of  creating\n\ncomplete  diversity of  citizenship, the  lack of  which had\n\nbeen  cited by the defendants  as a basis  for dismissal for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs did not\n\nspecify  upon  which  paragraph  of Rule  41(a)1  they  were\n\n                    \n\n1   The pertinent provisions of Rule 41(a) are as follows:\n\n          Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions\n\n          (a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nrelying.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who\n\nendorsed  the motion,  \"Denied.   Rule  41(a)(1)(ii).\"   The\n\nmagistrate  judge apparently  did not  consider whether  the\n\nmotion should be granted on conditions under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(a)(2).\n\n          The district  judge thereafter entered  a judgment\n\nfor the  defendants upon  the allowance  of their motion  to\n\ndismiss or for summary  judgment.   He ruled  (1) that since\n\nthe motion under Rule  41(a) had been properly denied  under\n\nRule 41(a)(1), the two local corporations  were still in the\n\ncase, so that subject matter jurisdiction failed for lack of\n\ndiversity; and (2), alternatively, that the complaint failed\n\n                    \n\n               (1)  By Plaintiff;  by Stipulation.\n          Subject to the provisions of Rule 23(e),\n          of Rule  66, and  of any statute  of the\n          United   States,   an   action  may   be\n          dismissed by the plaintiff without order\n          of  court (i)  by  filing  a  notice  of\n          dismissal at any  time before service by\n          the  other party  of an  answer or  of a\n          motion  for summary  judgment, whichever\n          first  occurs,  or   (ii)  by  filing  a\n          stipulation of dismissal  signed by  all\n          parties who have appeared in the action.\n          . . . \n\n               (2)  By Order  of Court.  Except as\n               (2)  By Order  of Court.  \n          provided  in  paragraph   (1)  of   this\n          subdivision  of  this  rule,  an  action\n          shall   not   be   dismissed    at   the\n          plaintiff's instance save upon  order of\n          the  court  and  upon  such   terms  and\n          conditions as the court deems proper.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nto  state a  claim  against Pharmco  and Interamerican,  and\n\nthere was no personal jurisdiction over the other Smithkline\n\ncorporations.   This appeal followed.\n\n          It   would  appear  from  the  magistrate  judge's\n\nendorsement that the  magistrate intended  to determine  the\n\nmotion.    This  was  error,  because  under  28   U.S.C.   \n\n636(b)(1)(A)  and  (B), a  motion  to  dismiss  may  not  be\n\nreferred  for  determination,   but  only  for   report  and\n\nrecommendation to  the district judge.   Accordingly we will\n\ntreat the magistrate judge's endorsement as a recommendation\n\nto  the district judge.  The magistrate judge was correct in\n\nrecommending denial of  the motion  for voluntary  dismissal\n\nunder Rule 41(a)(1), since a motion for summary judgment had\n\nbeen filed and the parties had filed no stipulation.  \n\n          The  plaintiffs  may well  have  been entitled  to\n\ndismiss non-diverse  parties for the purpose of establishing\n\ndiversity  jurisdiction  under  Rule  41(a)(2),  absent  any\n\nshowing  of prejudice  to  the  defendants2.   Newman-Green,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n     2   The   defendants'   argument   that   Pharmco   and\nInteramerican   were   indispensable   parties  is   totally\ninsupportable  on the  record.   Mrs.  Trinidad Delgado  had\nreceived  workers'  compensation  from the  State  Insurance\nFund,  which,  as  the  defendants correctly  argued,  is  a\ncomplete defense to a direct claim against her employer,  of\nwhich Pharmco  is the corporate successor. 11 L.P.R.A.   21.\nMoreover, it is   difficult to understand how Interamerican,\nwhich  was a sales organization, had anything to do with the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nInc. v.  Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826,  833 (1989); Sweeney\n                                                            \n\nv. Westvaco Co., 926  F.2d 29, 41 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\n                                                           \n\n112 S. Ct.  274 (1991); cf. Leroux v. Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co.,\n                                                           \n\n626 F. Supp. 962, 965 (D. Mass. 1986). \n\n          The plaintiffs never sought reconsideration by the\n\ndistrict  judge of the  magistrate's recommendation  to deny\n\nplaintiffs' voluntary motion to dismiss, however.  Under the\n\nLocal  Rules  of  Puerto  Rico  510.1,  an   appeal  from  a\n\ndetermination by a magistrate judge must be filed within ten\n\ndays, or the  determination becomes a  ruling of the  court;\n\nbut   under  Local   Rule  501.2(A),   an  objection   to  a\n\nrecommendation  and report  must  also be  filed within  ten\n\ndays, and \"[f]ailure to file objections within the specified\n\ntime waives the right to appeal the District Court's order.\"\n\n          Not  only did  the plaintiffs  fail to  follow the\n\nlocal  rule, they failed  to honor the  rationale behind it,\n\nwhich as the Supreme Court pointed out in Thomas v. Arn, 474\n                                                         \n\nU.S. 140, 147-48 (1985), is to \n\n          enable  [ ] the  district judge to focus\n          attention on those issues -- factual and\n          legal --  that are  at the heart  of the\n          parties'  dispute.   The  [  ] rule,  by\n\n                    \n\nmanufacturing  process in  which Mrs.  Trinidad  Delgado was\ninjured.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          precluding appellate review of any issue\n          not contained in objections,  prevents a\n          litigant from 'sandbagging' the district\n          judge  by failing  to  object  and  then\n          appealing.\n\n          As we  have said, the magistrate  judge's decision\n\nmust  be treated  as no  more than  a recommendation  to the\n\ndistrict judge.  Because of the plaintiffs' complete failure\n\nto protect their  rights under Local Rule 510.2(A) (or under\n\nRule 501.1  either,  for that  matter),  the ruling  of  the\n\ndistrict judge is not  appealable.  Keating v. Secretary  of\n                                                            \n\nHealth and Human Serv.,  848 F.2d 271, 275 (1st  Cir. 1988).\n                      \n\nFor  purposes   of  this  appeal,  therefore,   Pharmco  and\n\nInteramerican remain parties in the case.  \n\n          Given this state of the record, the court's ruling\n\nthat there  was no  subject matter jurisdiction  must stand.\n\nThe  uncontradicted affidavits  submitted by  the defendants\n\nfirmly establish that Puerto Rico was the principal place of\n\nbusiness of both Pharmco and Interamerican.  For purposes of\n\ndiversity,  they are  citizens of  Puerto Rico, 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1332(c)(1),  as  are   the  plaintiffs.    Absent   complete\n\ndiversity  of citizenship,  there  is no  basis for  subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.  \n\n          There is no need  to examine the court's alternate\n\ngrounds for dismissal.  \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n          The  judgment  of  dismissal  is  affirmed.    The\n\nappellees shall recover their costs.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n",

Nevertheless, after the filing of\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nthis  motion,  all  parties  and  the  court  treated  these\n\ncorporations  as properly before the court, at least for the\n\npurpose of presenting their  motions for summary judgment on\n\njurisdictional grounds  and to dismiss for  failure to state\n\nclaims  against certain  of the  defendants.   Counsel never\n\nfiled an  answer with respect  to the added  defendants, but\n\ndid  file a  motion to  dismiss or  for summary  judgment on\n\nbehalf  of  all  named  defendants.   For  purposes  of this\n\nappeal, we too will treat all parties as properly before the\n\ncourt.\n\n          About a month  after the motion to dismiss  or for\n\nsummary judgment was filed by the defendants, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion  under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  41(a) for  voluntary\n\ndismissal of Pharmco and Interamerican, the two corporations\n\nhaving their  principal places  of business in  Puerto Rico.\n\nThis motion  was filed  for the  avowed purpose of  creating\n\ncomplete  diversity of  citizenship, the  lack of  which had\n\nbeen  cited by the defendants  as a basis  for dismissal for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs did not\n\nspecify  upon  which  paragraph  of Rule  41(a)1  they  were\n\n                    \n\n1   The pertinent provisions of Rule 41(a) are as follows:\n\n          Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions\n\n          (a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nrelying.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who\n\nendorsed  the motion,  \"Denied.   Rule  41(a)(1)(ii).\"   The\n\nmagistrate  judge apparently  did not  consider whether  the\n\nmotion should be granted on conditions under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(a)(2).\n\n          The district  judge thereafter entered  a judgment\n\nfor the  defendants upon  the allowance  of their motion  to\n\ndismiss or for summary  judgment.   He ruled  (1) that since\n\nthe motion under Rule  41(a) had been properly denied  under\n\nRule 41(a)(1), the two local corporations  were still in the\n\ncase, so that subject matter jurisdiction failed for lack of\n\ndiversity; and (2), alternatively, that the complaint failed\n\n                    \n\n               (1)  By Plaintiff;  by Stipulation.\n          Subject to the provisions of Rule 23(e),\n          of Rule  66, and  of any statute  of the\n          United   States,   an   action  may   be\n          dismissed by the plaintiff without order\n          of  court (i)  by  filing  a  notice  of\n          dismissal at any  time before service by\n          the  other party  of an  answer or  of a\n          motion  for summary  judgment, whichever\n          first  occurs,  or   (ii)  by  filing  a\n          stipulation of dismissal  signed by  all\n          parties who have appeared in the action.\n          . . . \n\n               (2)  By Order  of Court.  Except as\n               (2)  By Order  of Court.  \n          provided  in  paragraph   (1)  of   this\n          subdivision  of  this  rule,  an  action\n          shall   not   be   dismissed    at   the\n          plaintiff's instance save upon  order of\n          the  court  and  upon  such   terms  and\n          conditions as the court deems proper.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nto  state a  claim  against Pharmco  and Interamerican,  and\n\nthere was no personal jurisdiction over the other Smithkline\n\ncorporations.   This appeal followed.\n\n          It   would  appear  from  the  magistrate  judge's\n\nendorsement that the  magistrate intended  to determine  the\n\nmotion.    This  was  error,  because  under  28   U.S.C.   \n\n636(b)(1)(A)  and  (B), a  motion  to  dismiss  may  not  be\n\nreferred  for  determination,   but  only  for   report  and\n\nrecommendation to  the district judge.   Accordingly we will\n\ntreat the magistrate judge's endorsement as a recommendation\n\nto  the district judge.  The magistrate judge was correct in\n\nrecommending denial of  the motion  for voluntary  dismissal\n\nunder Rule 41(a)(1), since a motion for summary judgment had\n\nbeen filed and the parties had filed no stipulation.  \n\n          The  plaintiffs  may well  have  been entitled  to\n\ndismiss non-diverse  parties for the purpose of establishing\n\ndiversity  jurisdiction  under  Rule  41(a)(2),  absent  any\n\nshowing  of prejudice  to  the  defendants2.

Mrs.  Trinidad Delgado  had\nreceived  workers'  compensation  from the  State  Insurance\nFund,  which,  as  the  defendants correctly  argued,  is  a\ncomplete defense to a direct claim against her employer,  of\nwhich Pharmco  is the corporate successor. 11 L.P.R.A.   21.\nMoreover, it is   difficult to understand how Interamerican,\nwhich  was a sales organization, had anything to do with the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nInc. v.
