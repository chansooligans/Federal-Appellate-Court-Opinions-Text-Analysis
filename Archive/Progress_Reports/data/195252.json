On August 17,  1992, a jury\n                                   \n\nfound defendant-appellant Angel A.  Soldevila-L pez (\"Soldevila\")\n\nguilty  jury of  four counts  of conspiracy  to possess  with the\n\nintent  to  distribute fifty  kilograms  of cocaine  and  using a\n\ncommunication  facility  in the  commission  of  the offense,  in\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    2 and 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 843(b),\n\nand 846.\n\n          On November  27, three  days before sentencing  date of\n\nNovember  30,  trial  counsel  for  Soldevila,  Nicol s  Nogueras\n\n(\"Attorney Nogueras\") raised the issue  of Soldevila's competence\n\nto  be   sentenced  in   a  motion  requesting   psychiatric  and\n\npsychological   examination.      The  district   court   granted\n\nSoldevila's motion.\n\n          Following  a  psychiatric  evaluation by  both  a court\n\nappointed  psychiatrist and  a  court  appointed psychologist,  a\n\ncompetency hearing  was set for  May 24,  1993.  At  the hearing,\n\nupon the suggestion of counsel for Soldevila, the court concluded\n\nthat Soldevila should be reevaluated on that day to determine his\n\ncompetency  for sentencing  purposes.  Dr.  Scott A.  Duncan, the\n\ncourt  appointed  psychologist,  reevaluated  Soldevila  and  the\n\nhearing continued on the next day.\n\n          On  May 25, doctor Duncan  presented an addendum to his\n\nprevious evaluation of Soldevila, stating for the first time that\n\nSoldevila was \"malingering\"  (i.e., feigning incompetency).   The\n                                  \n\ndistrict court denied Soldevila's motion for a continuance, found\n\nSoldevila  competent  to  be  sentenced  and  imposed   sentence.\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nSoldevila  appeals  from the  final  judgment  of conviction  and\n\nsentence.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Soldevila has a recent history of psychiatric problems.\n\nAs recently as the spring of 1992 he was receiving psychotherapy,\n\nincluding  prescription  medications  for  his  illness.1    This\n\ninformation, however, was  not brought  to the  attention of  the\n\ndistrict court  at any time during  trial or at anytime  prior to\n\nAttorney  Nogueras'  motion  for  psychiatric  and  psychological\n\nevaluation of  November 27,  1992.   In  the November 27  motion,\n\nAttorney Nogueras  stated  that Soldevila,  in conversation  with\n\ncounsel, \"looks  and reacts  introvertedly, like absent  from the\n\nconversation,  very  depressed, and  in  a  mental and  emotional\n\ncondition  that   requires   a  psychiatric   and   psychological\n\nexamination before sentencing.\"  Attorney Nogueras indicated that\n\nhe had observed related symptoms during trial, but had attributed\n\nthem  to Soldevila's  anxiety, believing  they  were \"due  to the\n\ntension   created  by  his   arrest,  imprisonment   and  trial.\"\n\nFollowing  trial, Attorney  Nogueras discovered  additional facts\n\nwhich  led   him  to  conclude   that  he  had   \"undervalued  or\n\nunderestimated the nature and  extent of [Soldevila's] mental and\n\n                    \n\n1   Appellate counsel  obtained Soldevila's medical  history from\nSoldevila's daughter, Blanca.  Much  of the history is  contained\nin  photostatic copies  of prescriptions appended  to Soldevila's\nbrief and  in a letter dated  May 10, 1993, written  by Blanca in\nwhich she observes that she  had supplied Attorney Nogueras, with\nvarious  medical records in  June of 1992.   She also stated that\nshe had suggested to Nogueras that he submit a motion  to provide\nSoldevila with proper  medical treatment but that her  advice was\nnot heeded.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nemotional  condition at the time of the alleged commission of the\n\noffense .  . . and at  the time of  trial.\"  In particular,  in a\n\nNovember  23, 1992  conversation  between counsel  and Dr.  Jorge\n\nPrieto, the  prison's  doctor, doctor  Prieto, informed  Attorney\n\nNogueras  that Soldevila  was  prescribed \"Xanax,\"  used for  the\n\nmanagement  of  anxiety  disorder or  the  short  term  relief of\n\nsymptoms of anxiety, Physicians' Desk Reference at 2456 (48th ed.\n\n1994)  (herinafter \"PDR\"),  and \"Ativan\"2  during trial  in doses\n\n\"[c]ounsel believed  did not affect defendant's  awareness of the\n\nconsequences of the proceedings against him.\"  Doctor Prieto said\n\nthat  his observations  of Soldevila  on June  29 (i.e.  prior to\n                                                       \n\ntrial), led  him to conclude  that Soldevila  had a  \"psychiatric\n\ncondition.\"   Doctor Prieto also indicated that, by May 27, 1992,\n\nSoldevila  \"was not  communicative  and had  lapses of  absence.\"\n\nTherefore, Attorney Nogueras felt  that a psychiatric examination\n\nwas needed.\n\n          In response to  Soldevila's motion, the district  court\n\njudge stated  that he had  seen Soldevila \"interact  with counsel\n\nduring   the   case,   and   [Soldevila]   was   fully  oriented,\n\nparticipated, from what I could see from the bench, fully reacted\n\nwhen there  was something  to react to.   [Sic] Smiled  and dealt\n\nwith the points  that were  scored when the  defense scored  such\n\npoints.   It was quite obvious that the person that was before me\n\n                    \n\n2  Ativan  is an antianxiety agent which \"is  not recommended for\nuse in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis.\"\nPDR at 2516.  With regards to this medication, the PDR warns that\n\"[i]n   patients   with   depression   accompanying   anxiety,  a\npossibility for suicide should be borne in mind.\"  Id.\n                                                      \n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nhere was not a zombie of any kind.   He was a person who was here\n\noriented  in all  spheres.\"   Still, the  district court  granted\n\nSoldevila's   motion   and   ordered   that   Soldevila   undergo\n\npsychological  and psychiatric  evaluation  at  the  Springfield,\n\nMissouri  Medical  Center  for  Federal  Prisoners  to  determine\n\nwhether  he suffered  from a  mental disease  and then  return to\n\nPuerto Rico  for final sentencing.   The district court entered a\n\nprovisional  sentence against  Soldevila  pursuant  to 18  U.S.C.\n\n  4244(d).\n\n          On  March 9,  the Bureau of  Prisons issued  a forensic\n\nevaluation  of  Soldevila,  signed  by Scott  A.  Duncan,  Psy.D,\n\nForensic Studies Coordinator of the United States Penitentiary in\n\nAtlanta   (\"doctor   Duncan\"),  Angel   L pez   M.Ed.  and   Sara\n\nBoucchechter, M.A..  The report concluded that Soldevila suffered\n\nfrom \"major Depression, Recurrent,  With Psychotic Features, Mood\n\nCongruent.\"\n\n          On April 20,  1993, in response to the  court's inquiry\n\nregarding  \"the approximate time  frame that  Mr. Soldevila-L pez\n\nsuffered from  psychotic depression,\" doctor  Duncan submitted to\n\nthe district  judge an  \"Addendum to Psychological  Evaluation.\" \n\nIn  this   addendum,  doctor   Duncan  concluded  that,   in  his\n\nprofessional    opinion,    Soldevila's   psychotic    depression\n\n\"originated approximately  in September/October 1992 as  a result\n\nof  stress stemming  from  being  found  guilty  of  his  current\n\ncharges, being  tried  . .  .  and being  housed in  a  stressful\n\nenvironment.\"\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\n          On  April 27,  1993,  the district  court ordered  that\n\nSoldevila be transferred  to Puerto  Rico no later  than May  20,\n\n1993, for  a competency hearing to be  held on May 24,  1993.  On\n\nMay  12,  1993, Henry  F.  Furst, current  appellate  counsel for\n\nSoldevila, (\"Attorney Furst\") sent Attorney Nogueras a letter via\n\ntelefax  informing Nogueras  that the  Soldevila family  wanted a\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Steven S. Simring, to examine Soldevila as soon\n\nas  possible.   Soldevila  was  transferred  to the  Metropolitan\n\nDetention  Center in  Guaynabo, Puerto  Rico (\"MDC\")  on May  20,\n\n1993,  four days before the competency hearing was to take place.\n\nAttorney Nogueras  moved for a  continuance, in order  for doctor\n\nSimring  to evaluate  Soldevila  and be  presented  as an  expert\n\nwitness on Soldevila's behalf.  The district court denied the May\n\n21, 1993 motion for a continuance.\n\n          On the  same day,  Soldevila filed a  motion requesting\n\nthe district court's permission  to have doctor Simring interview\n\nhim  for a  psychiatric assessment,  to  allow Attorney  Furst to\n\nappear  at the  competency hearing,  and to  duplicate copies  of\n\nrecords,  transcripts and  tapes  used  during  the trial.    The\n\ndistrict court granted Soldevila's latter motion in all respects.\n\n          The competency  hearing took place  on May  24 and  25,\n\n1993.  On May 24, Attorney Nogueras told the court he had visited\n\nSoldevila  recently but  that  Soldevila  was not  communicative.\n\nAttorney   Nogueras   said   he   found   \"[him]self   completely\n\nincapacitated  to  convey  to  [Soldevila] the  meaning  of  this\n\nhearing.\"   Attorney Nogueras further informed the court that one\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nof  the prison guards referred  to Soldevila as  \"my Valium man.\"\n\nAttorney  Nogueras also  alluded  to the  availability of  doctor\n\nSimring to examine Soldevila, but suggested this was not possible\n\ngiven the court's denial of Soldevila's motion for a continuance.\n\nDoctor Duncan then testified that  when Soldevila arrived at  the\n\nUnited  States  Penitentiary in  Atlanta,  on  February 3,  1993,\n\nSoldevila was suicidal and possibly suffering from psychosis.  He\n\nwas unable to concentrate  sufficiently to complete psychological\n\ntesting.     Soldevila   was  then   administered  \"Haldol,\"   an\n\nantipsychotic medication.   In doctor Duncan's  last contact with\n\nSoldevila,  ten days  prior  to the  hearing, Soldevila  appeared\n\n\"oriented to  time, place, person,  and reason  of being  there.\"\n\nDoctor Duncan indicated that  he stood by his previous  report of\n\nMarch  9 in  which  he gave  his  opinion that  Soldevila  needed\n\nimmediate hospitalization for  treatment for psychotic depression\n\nand that he should remain on \"Haldol.\"\n\n          At the request  of Attorney  Nogueras, the  proceedings\n\nwere adjourned to permit doctor Duncan to interview Soldevila and\n\nto  review  his  medical  charts  and  determine  whether  he had\n\ncontinued to  take the medication  prescribed to him  in Atlanta.\n\nThe court directed doctor Duncan to provide the defense access to\n\ninformation regarding  the medication Soldevila was  receiving at\n\nMDC, as  well as a copy of Soldevila's medical chart.3  The court\n\n                    \n\n3  After Attorney Nogueras asked the court to order him access to\ninformation regarding the medication Soldevila had been taking at\nMDC, the following exchange took place:\n\n          MR. NOGUERAS:   Your  Honor, of  course, your\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nalso indicated that doctor Simring, would be permitted to examine\n\nSoldevila if he flew to Puerto Rico.\n\n          On May 25, Soldevila  filed a motion requesting further\n\npsychiatric evaluation.   The  motion stated that  the government\n\nhad not complied with the court's May 24 order to provide defense\n\ncounsel  a  copy  of Soldevila's  chart  and  requested  that the\n\ngovernment  comply.   Attached  to the  motion  was the  May 10th\n\nletter  sent to  doctor Duncan  by Soldevila's  daughter, Blanca,\n\nsetting   forth  Soldevila's   medical  history   of  psychiatric\n\nproblems.  Attorney Nogueras indicated that he was attempting  to\n\nlocate  Dr. Agust n  Garc a,  a  local  psychiatrist or  clinical\n\npsychologist, to analyze Soldevila's psychiatric condition.\n\n          Also, on May  25, doctor Duncan filed a second addendum\n\nto  the forensic report.   The addendum  concluded that Soldevila\n\nwas malingering.  Doctor  Duncan indicated that the previous  day\n\nhe reviewed Soldevila's  medical records and  met with Dr.  Vasco\n\nDaub n,  the  chief  psychologist   at  MDC,  and  together  they\n\nconducted an interview of Soldevila.\n\n          During the  interview, doctors Duncan  and Daub n  gave\n\nSoldevila  a  neuropsychological  memory  test  for  malingering,\n\ncalled the Rey 15-item test.  Because Soldevila's performance was\n\n                    \n\n          Honor has  to understand  that if we  get the\n          information this  afternoon,  we do  have  to\n          make a decision in regard to whether we would\n          be  then having  the  time to  get to  doctor\n          Simring to react on this information.\n\n          THE  COURT:  Believe me, I  will give you the\n          time you  need.  Just remember  also that you\n          have had since November 3rd [sic] to do this.\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nlower than that expected  of even someone who was  severely brain\n\ndamaged, doctor  Duncan concluded Soldevila was  malingering.  As\n\nfurther  evidence  of malingering,  doctor Duncan  indicated that\n\nSoldevila claimed  to have practically every  symptom about which\n\nhe  was  asked, whether  or not  they  were actually  symptoms of\n\npsychosis.   Additionally, Soldevila complained of hearing voices\n\nprimarily at night, a time of day when his use of \"Haldol\" was in\n\nfact  maximized.  On  occasion, Soldevila was  able to understand\n\nquestions  asked him  in English  and to  respond in  Spanish, an\n\nability   requiring  high  cognitive  skills,  inconsistent  with\n\npsychosis.  Doctor Duncan concluded that he had seen nothing that\n\nwould  indicate  Soldevila  was  incapable  of  understanding the\n\ncharges  or cooperating with his lawyer and that he was competent\n\nfor  sentencing  purposes.     Doctor  Daub n  testified  to  his\n\nparticipation  in the  interviews  of Soldevila  and agreed  with\n\ndoctor Duncan's diagnosis of malingering.\n\n          On May  25, 1993,  the court found  that Soldevila  was\n\ncompetent to be sentenced.  The court pointed out that, until the\n\nverdict, there had been no indication that Soldevila had any kind\n\nof mental defect  that would have  impeded the trial.   The court\n\nfound that Soldevila  \"understood what  was happening and  . .  .\n\nassisted  his  lawyer  in the  preparation  of  the  case.\"   The\n\ndistrict  court   judge  further  stated  that   \"[h]ad  it  been\n\ndifferent, I would have been notified by Mr. Nogueras, and he did\n\nnot tell me  anything at the  time.\"  The  court found that  once\n\nfound  guilty and placed  in the Puerto  Rico State penitentiary,\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nSoldevila  became  depressed  and  psychotic, but  that,  he  was\n\nprescribed  medication   and  presently   \"is  competent   to  be\n\nsentenced.\"\n\n          On appeal, Soldevila argues that (1) Attorney Nogueras'\n\nfailure  to  timely investigate  and  argue  Soldevila's lack  of\n\ncompetency to stand  trial denied Soldevila  effective assistance\n\nof  counsel;  (2) Attorney  Nogueras  had an  actual  conflict of\n\ninterest with Soldevila  and the district court erred  in failing\n\nto bring this conflict to the attention of Soldevila; and (3) the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to grant Soldevila's motion  for\n\na  continuance of  the  competency hearing  and  in finding  that\n\nSoldevila was competent to be sentenced.\n\n                INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n                                                 \n\n          Soldevila's  claim  that  trial  counsel's  failure  to\n\ntimely investigate  and argue  Soldevila's lack of  competency to\n\nstand trial  denied Soldevila effective assistance  of counsel is\n\nraised for the first time  on direct appeal.

An exception\n      \n\nto this rule exists  \"where the critical facts are not  genuinely\n\nin dispute  and the  record is  sufficiently  developed to  allow\n\nreasoned consideration of an  ineffective assistance claim.\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\n(citations  omitted).

In\n\ndetermining  the merits of a  claim for ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel,  our   review  of  counsel's  performance   is  \"not  in\n\nhindsight,  but based  on what  the lawyer  knew, or  should have\n\nknown,  at  the   time  his  tactical   choices  were  made   and\n\nimplemented.\"  United States  v.

In the present case,  the district court did not make any\n\nfindings of critical facts such as when Attorney Nogueras  became\n\naware of Soldevila's psychiatric history  and the exact nature of\n\nthat  history that  would  enable us  to determine  what Attorney\n\nNogueras  \"knew or should have  known\" at different stages during\n\nhis representation of Soldevila.   Neither are these facts  clear\n\nfrom the record.  The proper  method for pursuing  claims of this\n\nnature is through a collateral proceeding in district court under\n\n28 U.S.C.    2255 so  that proper factual  determinations can  be\n\nmade.  United States v.  Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 774  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1991), cert. denied, 112 S.

Soldevila\n\ncontends  that  the conflict  developed  after  Attorney Nogueras\n\nrealized that  he  had erred  by failing  to raise  the issue  of\n\nSoldevila's  mental  competence  at   an  earlier  stage  in  the\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nproceedings.  At that point, Attorney Nogueras had an interest in\n\nraising the competency issue to appease Soldevila and Soldevila's\n\nfamily, but  also  had an  interest in  losing the  issue on  the\n\nmerits  to show  that he was  not at  fault for  having failed to\n\nraise it  in a timely fashion.   Indeed, the worst  case scenario\n\nfor Attorney  Nogueras, argues Soldevila, would have been for the\n\ncourt to  have found that the competency issue may have had merit\n\nbut was waived or was now otherwise not susceptible to definitive\n\nresolution.  These potential  problems for Attorney Nogueras were\n\nneatly resolved by the court's denial of the defense claim on the\n\nmerits.\n\n          Although  Soldevila's  claim   of  actual  conflict  of\n\ninterest  is, in  effect, a  claim of  ineffective  assistance of\n\ncounsel,  we find  the  record \"sufficiently  developed to  allow\n\nreasoned  consideration\"  of  this  particular  claim  on  direct\n\nappeal.  See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309; see discussion infra p.9.\n                                                           \n\n          Soldevila did not object to any conflict of interest at\n\ntrial.  In Cuyler v.  Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980),  the Supreme\n                              \n\nCourt established that  \"[i]n order to  establish a violation  of\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, a defendant who raised no objection at trial\n\nmust demonstrate  that an  actual conflict of  interest adversely\n\naffected  his  lawyer's performance.\"  Cuyler,  446  U.S. at  348\n                                             \n\n(footnote omitted).   Although this standard  was first developed\n\nin  the context  of  counsel's joint  representation of  criminal\n\ndefendants, it has  been applied generally  to other conflict  of\n\ninterest situations, including alleged conflicts  between counsel\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nand his or her client.

The circumstances alleged by Soldevila,\n\nas a  matter of  law,  do not  amount to  an  actual conflict  of\n\ninterest  between Attorney  Nogueras and  Soldevila.

Thus,\n\ndefense  counsel   never  retained  a   psychiatrist  to  examine\n\ndefendant, nor did he  take any other action calculated  to flesh\n\nout facts supporting the defense position.\"\n\n          At  no time  prior  to May  25, the  final  day of  the\n\ncompetency  hearing,  did  anyone   contend  that  Soldevila  was\n\nmalingering.   Attorney  Nogueras was  not given  doctor Duncan's\n\nfinal  report, concluding that  Soldevila was  malingering, until\n\nafter  4:00 p.m.  on  May 25,    only  moments  before the  final\n\nhearing.  In light of this surprise, attorney Nogueras was unable\n\nto prepare  any response to doctor  Duncan's allegedly surprising\n\nconclusion.   Attorney Nogueras was diligent in responding to the\n\nallegations that Soldevila was malingering as soon as possible.\n\n          By no  means do we endorse  Attorney Nogueras' behavior\n\nin  waiting until  the  last  minute to  try  to obtain  his  own\n\nexperts, followed by what could be perceived as a strategy to buy\n\nmore  time by first  asking the court  for a recess  in order for\n\ndoctor Duncan  to reevaluate Soldevila  and then filing  a motion\n\nfor  a  continuance in  order  to  have time  to  respond  to any\n\nfindings doctor Duncan might make.\n\n          Following     doctor   Duncan's   new  and   unexpected\n\nconclusion that Soldevila was malingering, however, Soldevila was\n\nentitled to an opportunity to prepare a response to that finding.\n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\n\"[A]ppellant was  entitled to  call psychiatric witnesses  of his\n\nown choosing who, after examining  appellant, could testify as to\n\nhis mental state.\"  United States v.

Pope,  841 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n954.   The  relevance  of additional  expert testimony,  however,\n\nshould have been apparent  from Soldevila's behavior and Attorney\n\nNogueras'  comments  at both  the  competency  hearing and  final\n\nsentencing on May 24 and May 25.  See id.\n                                         \n\n          At the  May 24 hearing, Attorney  Nogueras informed the\n\ncourt that on May 23, he and Attorney Furst went to see Soldevila\n\nat  the MDC  and that  during this  visit, Attorney  Nogueras was\n\nunable \"to get through to [Soldevila]  at all,\" Attorney Nogueras\n\nfound himself completely incapacitated to convey to Soldevila the\n\nmeaning of the upcoming competency hearing, and Soldevila did not\n\nrecognize  Attorney Furst, who had  been his attorney  for a long\n\ntime.\n\n          On May 25, before the district court judge  imposed the\n\nfinal sentence, Attorney  Nogueras informed the court that he had\n\njust asked Soldevila  if he knew what was  going on and Soldevila\n\nsaid no.  At sentencing the following exchange took place:\n\n          THE COURT:  .  . . If he admits  guilt today,\n          he says I am sorry, Judge, for what I did.  I\n          bought those  25 kilos  of cocaine.   He says\n          that,  I will give him the two points.  If he\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\n          doesn't say that, I won't . . . .\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:   I  will ask  my client  that\n          right now.\n\n          THE COURT:  He will have to explain to me why\n          he is sorry.\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:  To be on the record I want, I\n          don't even know if he understands.\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:   Well,  let the  record show,\n          your   Honor,  that  I  made  four  different\n          questions to defendant.  One, what  was going\n          on; number  two, did  he buy  cocaine; number\n          three,  does he  know that  he might  get two\n          points reduced  in his sentencing.   He says,\n          no, I don't remember what [sic].\n\n          THE COURT:  Okay.   So, he has no  two points\n          . . . .\n\n(A. 232).\n\n          The continuance  would  have  clearly  been  useful  to\n\nenable Soldevila  to present expert testimony  that might respond\n\nto doctor  Duncan's new allegations  of malingering.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

In failing to  grant the\n\nrequested continuance  . . . the  trial court clearly  abused its\n\ndiscretion.'

The continuance would also have helped counsel prepare an\n\nexplanation for Soldevila's responses at sentencing.\n\n                        3.  Inconvenience\n                                         \n\n          Undeniably, the prospect of a  continuance implied some\n\ninconvenience to the district court and to doctor Duncan.  Doctor\n\nDuncan  was not  a  local  witness.    The  postponement  of  the\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\ncompetency hearing from  May 24  to May 25  had already  required\n\ndoctor  Duncan  to  remain  in Puerto  Rico  an  additional  day.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the district court  could have held the continuance\n\n[Soldevila]  sought to  one or  two days.   Indeed,  the district\n\ncourt  could have  taken  an  active  role  in  making  sure  the\n\nevaluation  took place  and  quickly.   Balanced  against .  .  .\n\n[Soldevila's    need   for]   a   psychiatric   evaluation,   the\n\ninconvenience did not  justify the  denial.\"  Pope,  841 F.2d  at\n                                                  \n\n957.\n\n                          4.  Prejudice\n                                       \n\n          In the present case,  Soldevila was unable, without the\n\ncontinuance, to present witnesses of his own choosing  that might\n\nhave  responded to doctor Duncan's new and serious charge that he\n\nwas malingering.  A defendant's due process right to a fair trial\n\nincludes  the right not to be tried, convicted or sentenced while\n\nincompetent.  Drope  v. Missouri,  420 U.S.  162, 172-73  (1975).\n                                \n\nCongress  recognized and codified the right to a determination of\n\nmental  competency  to stand  trial  in  the Comprehensive  Crime\n\nControl Act  of 1984, 18  U.S.C.    4241.  This  statute \"permits\n\nmotions to  determine [the] competency  [of a defendant]  'at any\n                                                                 \n\ntime after  the commencement of  prosecution for  an offense  and\n    \n\nprior to the sentencing of the defendant . . . .'\"  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Pryor, 960 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                      \n\n          In order to  find a defendant competent  to stand trial\n\n\"it is not  enough for the district court judge  to find that the\n\ndefendant is oriented to time and place and has some recollection\n\nof  events.\"   Dusky  v.  United  States,  362  U.S.  402  (1960)\n                                        \n\n(internal  quotations  omitted).    Instead, the  \"test  must  be\n\nwhether he has  sufficient present  ability to  consult with  his\n\nlawyer  with a reasonable degree of rational understanding -- and\n\nwhether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the\n\nproceedings against him.\"  Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n                              \n\n          Soldevila's responses to  Attorney Nogueras'  questions\n\nand  Soldevila's  failure to  make  an  allocution at  sentencing\n\nsuggested that  Soldevila may  not have had  the constitutionally\n\nrequired  \"rational  as  well  as factual  understanding  of  the\n\nproceedings.\"   Although  doctor Duncan's  report suggested  that\n\nSoldevila   was   merely  malingering,   Soldevila   was  clearly\n\nprejudiced  by  his inability  to  present  witnesses that  could\n\nrespond to doctor Duncan's report.\n\n                          5.  Conclusion\n                                        \n\n          \"We recognize  that  [Soldevila] might  have  exercised\n\ngreater diligence than he did [and] [w]e do not intend to suggest\n\nthat the  degree of  diligence demonstrated by  [Soldevila] would\n\n                               -22-\n                                22\n\nnecessarily be  adequate under other circumstances.\"   Flynt, 756\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  1360.  However,  because Soldevila has  a constitutional\n\nright  not  to  be   sentenced  while  incompetent  and  suffered\n\nprejudice as  a  result  of  the  denial  of  his  motion  for  a\n\ncontinuance  and because  a  \"continuance could  have been  brief\n\nenough to cause only  minimal inconvenience, and would have  been\n\nuseful,\"    we conclude  that the  court's denial  of Soldevila's\n\nmotion for  a continuance  was arbitrary and  unreasonable.   See\n                                                                 \n\nPope, 841 F.2d at 958.  We therefore find that the district court\n    \n\nabused its  discretion in denying Soldevila's  motion and finding\n\nSoldevila competent to be sentenced.  \n\n           We vacate  Soldevila's sentence and  remand this  case\n\nfor  a full competency hearing  and resentencing, if Soldevila is\n\nfound competent to be sentenced.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n                              \n\n                               -23-\n                                23\n",

Soldevila-L pez (\"Soldevila\")\n\nguilty  jury of  four counts  of conspiracy  to possess  with the\n\nintent  to  distribute fifty  kilograms  of cocaine  and  using a\n\ncommunication  facility  in the  commission  of  the offense,  in\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    2 and 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 843(b),\n\nand 846.\n\n          On November  27, three  days before sentencing  date of\n\nNovember  30,  trial  counsel  for  Soldevila,  Nicol s  Nogueras\n\n(\"Attorney Nogueras\") raised the issue  of Soldevila's competence\n\nto  be   sentenced  in   a  motion  requesting   psychiatric  and\n\npsychological   examination.      The  district   court   granted\n\nSoldevila's motion.\n\n          Following  a  psychiatric  evaluation by  both  a court\n\nappointed  psychiatrist and  a  court  appointed psychologist,  a\n\ncompetency hearing  was set for  May 24,  1993.  At  the hearing,\n\nupon the suggestion of counsel for Soldevila, the court concluded\n\nthat Soldevila should be reevaluated on that day to determine his\n\ncompetency  for sentencing  purposes.  Dr.  Scott A.  Duncan, the\n\ncourt  appointed  psychologist,  reevaluated  Soldevila  and  the\n\nhearing continued on the next day.\n\n          On  May 25, doctor Duncan  presented an addendum to his\n\nprevious evaluation of Soldevila, stating for the first time that\n\nSoldevila was \"malingering\"  (i.e., feigning incompetency).   The\n                                  \n\ndistrict court denied Soldevila's motion for a continuance, found\n\nSoldevila  competent  to  be  sentenced  and  imposed   sentence.\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nSoldevila  appeals  from the  final  judgment  of conviction  and\n\nsentence.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Soldevila has a recent history of psychiatric problems.\n\nAs recently as the spring of 1992 he was receiving psychotherapy,\n\nincluding  prescription  medications  for  his  illness.1    This\n\ninformation, however, was  not brought  to the  attention of  the\n\ndistrict court  at any time during  trial or at anytime  prior to\n\nAttorney  Nogueras'  motion  for  psychiatric  and  psychological\n\nevaluation of  November 27,  1992.   In  the November 27  motion,\n\nAttorney Nogueras  stated  that Soldevila,  in conversation  with\n\ncounsel, \"looks  and reacts  introvertedly, like absent  from the\n\nconversation,  very  depressed, and  in  a  mental and  emotional\n\ncondition  that   requires   a  psychiatric   and   psychological\n\nexamination before sentencing.\"  Attorney Nogueras indicated that\n\nhe had observed related symptoms during trial, but had attributed\n\nthem  to Soldevila's  anxiety, believing  they  were \"due  to the\n\ntension   created  by  his   arrest,  imprisonment   and  trial.\"\n\nFollowing  trial, Attorney  Nogueras discovered  additional facts\n\nwhich  led   him  to  conclude   that  he  had   \"undervalued  or\n\nunderestimated the nature and  extent of [Soldevila's] mental and\n\n                    \n\n1   Appellate counsel  obtained Soldevila's medical  history from\nSoldevila's daughter, Blanca.  Much  of the history is  contained\nin  photostatic copies  of prescriptions appended  to Soldevila's\nbrief and  in a letter dated  May 10, 1993, written  by Blanca in\nwhich she observes that she  had supplied Attorney Nogueras, with\nvarious  medical records in  June of 1992.   She also stated that\nshe had suggested to Nogueras that he submit a motion  to provide\nSoldevila with proper  medical treatment but that her  advice was\nnot heeded.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nemotional  condition at the time of the alleged commission of the\n\noffense .  . . and at  the time of  trial.\"  In particular,  in a\n\nNovember  23, 1992  conversation  between counsel  and Dr.  Jorge\n\nPrieto, the  prison's  doctor, doctor  Prieto, informed  Attorney\n\nNogueras  that Soldevila  was  prescribed \"Xanax,\"  used for  the\n\nmanagement  of  anxiety  disorder or  the  short  term  relief of\n\nsymptoms of anxiety, Physicians' Desk Reference at 2456 (48th ed.\n\n1994)  (herinafter \"PDR\"),  and \"Ativan\"2  during trial  in doses\n\n\"[c]ounsel believed  did not affect defendant's  awareness of the\n\nconsequences of the proceedings against him.\"  Doctor Prieto said\n\nthat  his observations  of Soldevila  on June  29 (i.e.  prior to\n                                                       \n\ntrial), led  him to conclude  that Soldevila  had a  \"psychiatric\n\ncondition.\"   Doctor Prieto also indicated that, by May 27, 1992,\n\nSoldevila  \"was not  communicative  and had  lapses of  absence.\"\n\nTherefore, Attorney Nogueras felt  that a psychiatric examination\n\nwas needed.\n\n          In response to  Soldevila's motion, the district  court\n\njudge stated  that he had  seen Soldevila \"interact  with counsel\n\nduring   the   case,   and   [Soldevila]   was   fully  oriented,\n\nparticipated, from what I could see from the bench, fully reacted\n\nwhen there  was something  to react to.

With regards to this medication, the PDR warns that\n\"[i]n   patients   with   depression   accompanying   anxiety,  a\npossibility for suicide should be borne in mind.\"  Id.\n                                                      \n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nhere was not a zombie of any kind.   He was a person who was here\n\noriented  in all  spheres.\"   Still, the  district court  granted\n\nSoldevila's   motion   and   ordered   that   Soldevila   undergo\n\npsychological  and psychiatric  evaluation  at  the  Springfield,\n\nMissouri  Medical  Center  for  Federal  Prisoners  to  determine\n\nwhether  he suffered  from a  mental disease  and then  return to\n\nPuerto Rico  for final sentencing.   The district court entered a\n\nprovisional  sentence against  Soldevila  pursuant  to 18  U.S.C.\n\n  4244(d).\n\n          On  March 9,  the Bureau of  Prisons issued  a forensic\n\nevaluation  of  Soldevila,  signed  by Scott  A.  Duncan,  Psy.D,\n\nForensic Studies Coordinator of the United States Penitentiary in\n\nAtlanta   (\"doctor   Duncan\"),  Angel   L pez   M.Ed.  and   Sara\n\nBoucchechter, M.A..  The report concluded that Soldevila suffered\n\nfrom \"major Depression, Recurrent,  With Psychotic Features, Mood\n\nCongruent.\"\n\n          On April 20,  1993, in response to the  court's inquiry\n\nregarding  \"the approximate time  frame that  Mr. Soldevila-L pez\n\nsuffered from  psychotic depression,\" doctor  Duncan submitted to\n\nthe district  judge an  \"Addendum to Psychological  Evaluation.\" \n\nIn  this   addendum,  doctor   Duncan  concluded  that,   in  his\n\nprofessional    opinion,    Soldevila's   psychotic    depression\n\n\"originated approximately  in September/October 1992 as  a result\n\nof  stress stemming  from  being  found  guilty  of  his  current\n\ncharges, being  tried  . .  .  and being  housed in  a  stressful\n\nenvironment.\"\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\n          On  April 27,  1993,  the district  court ordered  that\n\nSoldevila be transferred  to Puerto  Rico no later  than May  20,\n\n1993, for  a competency hearing to be  held on May 24,  1993.  On\n\nMay  12,  1993, Henry  F.  Furst, current  appellate  counsel for\n\nSoldevila, (\"Attorney Furst\") sent Attorney Nogueras a letter via\n\ntelefax  informing Nogueras  that the  Soldevila family  wanted a\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Steven S. Simring, to examine Soldevila as soon\n\nas  possible.   Soldevila  was  transferred  to the  Metropolitan\n\nDetention  Center in  Guaynabo, Puerto  Rico (\"MDC\")  on May  20,\n\n1993,  four days before the competency hearing was to take place.\n\nAttorney Nogueras  moved for a  continuance, in order  for doctor\n\nSimring  to evaluate  Soldevila  and be  presented  as an  expert\n\nwitness on Soldevila's behalf.  The district court denied the May\n\n21, 1993 motion for a continuance.\n\n          On the  same day,  Soldevila filed a  motion requesting\n\nthe district court's permission  to have doctor Simring interview\n\nhim  for a  psychiatric assessment,  to  allow Attorney  Furst to\n\nappear  at the  competency hearing,  and to  duplicate copies  of\n\nrecords,  transcripts and  tapes  used  during  the trial.    The\n\ndistrict court granted Soldevila's latter motion in all respects.\n\n          The competency  hearing took place  on May  24 and  25,\n\n1993.  On May 24, Attorney Nogueras told the court he had visited\n\nSoldevila  recently but  that  Soldevila  was not  communicative.\n\nAttorney   Nogueras   said   he   found   \"[him]self   completely\n\nincapacitated  to  convey  to  [Soldevila] the  meaning  of  this\n\nhearing.\"   Attorney Nogueras further informed the court that one\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nof  the prison guards referred  to Soldevila as  \"my Valium man.\"\n\nAttorney  Nogueras also  alluded  to the  availability of  doctor\n\nSimring to examine Soldevila, but suggested this was not possible\n\ngiven the court's denial of Soldevila's motion for a continuance.\n\nDoctor Duncan then testified that  when Soldevila arrived at  the\n\nUnited  States  Penitentiary in  Atlanta,  on  February 3,  1993,\n\nSoldevila was suicidal and possibly suffering from psychosis.  He\n\nwas unable to concentrate  sufficiently to complete psychological\n\ntesting.     Soldevila   was  then   administered  \"Haldol,\"   an\n\nantipsychotic medication.   In doctor Duncan's  last contact with\n\nSoldevila,  ten days  prior  to the  hearing, Soldevila  appeared\n\n\"oriented to  time, place, person,  and reason  of being  there.\"\n\nDoctor Duncan indicated that  he stood by his previous  report of\n\nMarch  9 in  which  he gave  his  opinion that  Soldevila  needed\n\nimmediate hospitalization for  treatment for psychotic depression\n\nand that he should remain on \"Haldol.\"\n\n          At the request  of Attorney  Nogueras, the  proceedings\n\nwere adjourned to permit doctor Duncan to interview Soldevila and\n\nto  review  his  medical  charts  and  determine  whether  he had\n\ncontinued to  take the medication  prescribed to him  in Atlanta.\n\nThe court directed doctor Duncan to provide the defense access to\n\ninformation regarding  the medication Soldevila was  receiving at\n\nMDC, as  well as a copy of Soldevila's medical chart.3  The court\n\n                    \n\n3  After Attorney Nogueras asked the court to order him access to\ninformation regarding the medication Soldevila had been taking at\nMDC, the following exchange took place:\n\n          MR. NOGUERAS:   Your  Honor, of  course, your\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nalso indicated that doctor Simring, would be permitted to examine\n\nSoldevila if he flew to Puerto Rico.\n\n          On May 25, Soldevila  filed a motion requesting further\n\npsychiatric evaluation.   The  motion stated that  the government\n\nhad not complied with the court's May 24 order to provide defense\n\ncounsel  a  copy  of Soldevila's  chart  and  requested  that the\n\ngovernment  comply.   Attached  to the  motion  was the  May 10th\n\nletter  sent to  doctor Duncan  by Soldevila's  daughter, Blanca,\n\nsetting   forth  Soldevila's   medical  history   of  psychiatric\n\nproblems.  Attorney Nogueras indicated that he was attempting  to\n\nlocate  Dr. Agust n  Garc a,  a  local  psychiatrist or  clinical\n\npsychologist, to analyze Soldevila's psychiatric condition.\n\n          Also, on May  25, doctor Duncan filed a second addendum\n\nto  the forensic report.   The addendum  concluded that Soldevila\n\nwas malingering.  Doctor  Duncan indicated that the previous  day\n\nhe reviewed Soldevila's  medical records and  met with Dr.  Vasco\n\nDaub n,  the  chief  psychologist   at  MDC,  and  together  they\n\nconducted an interview of Soldevila.\n\n          During the  interview, doctors Duncan  and Daub n  gave\n\nSoldevila  a  neuropsychological  memory  test  for  malingering,\n\ncalled the Rey 15-item test.  Because Soldevila's performance was\n\n                    \n\n          Honor has  to understand  that if we  get the\n          information this  afternoon,  we do  have  to\n          make a decision in regard to whether we would\n          be  then having  the  time to  get to  doctor\n          Simring to react on this information.\n\n          THE  COURT:  Believe me, I  will give you the\n          time you  need.  Just remember  also that you\n          have had since November 3rd [sic] to do this.\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nlower than that expected  of even someone who was  severely brain\n\ndamaged, doctor  Duncan concluded Soldevila was  malingering.  As\n\nfurther  evidence  of malingering,  doctor Duncan  indicated that\n\nSoldevila claimed  to have practically every  symptom about which\n\nhe  was  asked, whether  or not  they  were actually  symptoms of\n\npsychosis.   Additionally, Soldevila complained of hearing voices\n\nprimarily at night, a time of day when his use of \"Haldol\" was in\n\nfact  maximized.  On  occasion, Soldevila was  able to understand\n\nquestions  asked him  in English  and to  respond in  Spanish, an\n\nability   requiring  high  cognitive  skills,  inconsistent  with\n\npsychosis.  Doctor Duncan concluded that he had seen nothing that\n\nwould  indicate  Soldevila  was  incapable  of  understanding the\n\ncharges  or cooperating with his lawyer and that he was competent\n\nfor  sentencing  purposes.     Doctor  Daub n  testified  to  his\n\nparticipation  in the  interviews  of Soldevila  and agreed  with\n\ndoctor Duncan's diagnosis of malingering.\n\n          On May  25, 1993,  the court found  that Soldevila  was\n\ncompetent to be sentenced.  The court pointed out that, until the\n\nverdict, there had been no indication that Soldevila had any kind\n\nof mental defect  that would have  impeded the trial.   The court\n\nfound that Soldevila  \"understood what  was happening and  . .  .\n\nassisted  his  lawyer  in the  preparation  of  the  case.\"   The\n\ndistrict  court   judge  further  stated  that   \"[h]ad  it  been\n\ndifferent, I would have been notified by Mr. Nogueras, and he did\n\nnot tell me  anything at the  time.\"  The  court found that  once\n\nfound  guilty and placed  in the Puerto  Rico State penitentiary,\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nSoldevila  became  depressed  and  psychotic, but  that,  he  was\n\nprescribed  medication   and  presently   \"is  competent   to  be\n\nsentenced.\"\n\n          On appeal, Soldevila argues that (1) Attorney Nogueras'\n\nfailure  to  timely investigate  and  argue  Soldevila's lack  of\n\ncompetency to stand  trial denied Soldevila  effective assistance\n\nof  counsel;  (2) Attorney  Nogueras  had an  actual  conflict of\n\ninterest with Soldevila  and the district court erred  in failing\n\nto bring this conflict to the attention of Soldevila; and (3) the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to grant Soldevila's motion  for\n\na  continuance of  the  competency hearing  and  in finding  that\n\nSoldevila was competent to be sentenced.\n\n                INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n                                                 \n\n          Soldevila's  claim  that  trial  counsel's  failure  to\n\ntimely investigate  and argue  Soldevila's lack of  competency to\n\nstand trial  denied Soldevila effective assistance  of counsel is\n\nraised for the first time  on direct appeal.

Soldevila\n\ncontends  that  the conflict  developed  after  Attorney Nogueras\n\nrealized that  he  had erred  by failing  to raise  the issue  of\n\nSoldevila's  mental  competence  at   an  earlier  stage  in  the\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nproceedings.  At that point, Attorney Nogueras had an interest in\n\nraising the competency issue to appease Soldevila and Soldevila's\n\nfamily, but  also  had an  interest in  losing the  issue on  the\n\nmerits  to show  that he was  not at  fault for  having failed to\n\nraise it  in a timely fashion.   Indeed, the worst  case scenario\n\nfor Attorney  Nogueras, argues Soldevila, would have been for the\n\ncourt to  have found that the competency issue may have had merit\n\nbut was waived or was now otherwise not susceptible to definitive\n\nresolution.  These potential  problems for Attorney Nogueras were\n\nneatly resolved by the court's denial of the defense claim on the\n\nmerits.\n\n          Although  Soldevila's  claim   of  actual  conflict  of\n\ninterest  is, in  effect, a  claim of  ineffective  assistance of\n\ncounsel,  we find  the  record \"sufficiently  developed to  allow\n\nreasoned  consideration\"  of  this  particular  claim  on  direct\n\nappeal.

Diligence\n                                       \n\n          It is clear that Attorney Nogueras could have exercised\n\ngreater  diligence locating  additional psychiatrists  to examine\n\nhis client prior to  the competency hearing.   As pointed out  by\n\nappellate  counsel for Soldevila,  after Attorney Nogueras raised\n\nthe  issue of  Soldevila's competence  to be  sentenced, \"defense\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\ncounsel  did  nothing to  support  his  previous suggestion  that\n\ndefendant may have been  incompetent . . . from November 30, 1992\n\nto May  19, 1993, trial  counsel did  nothing, waiting  virtually\n\nuntil the eve of the next proceedings to take any  action.  Thus,\n\ndefense  counsel   never  retained  a   psychiatrist  to  examine\n\ndefendant, nor did he  take any other action calculated  to flesh\n\nout facts supporting the defense position.\"\n\n          At  no time  prior  to May  25, the  final  day of  the\n\ncompetency  hearing,  did  anyone   contend  that  Soldevila  was\n\nmalingering.   Attorney  Nogueras was  not given  doctor Duncan's\n\nfinal  report, concluding that  Soldevila was  malingering, until\n\nafter  4:00 p.m.  on  May 25,    only  moments  before the  final\n\nhearing.  In light of this surprise, attorney Nogueras was unable\n\nto prepare  any response to doctor  Duncan's allegedly surprising\n\nconclusion.   Attorney Nogueras was diligent in responding to the\n\nallegations that Soldevila was malingering as soon as possible.\n\n          By no  means do we endorse  Attorney Nogueras' behavior\n\nin  waiting until  the  last  minute to  try  to obtain  his  own\n\nexperts, followed by what could be perceived as a strategy to buy\n\nmore  time by first  asking the court  for a recess  in order for\n\ndoctor Duncan  to reevaluate Soldevila  and then filing  a motion\n\nfor  a  continuance in  order  to  have time  to  respond  to any\n\nfindings doctor Duncan might make.\n\n          Following     doctor   Duncan's   new  and   unexpected\n\nconclusion that Soldevila was malingering, however, Soldevila was\n\nentitled to an opportunity to prepare a response to that finding.\n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\n\"[A]ppellant was  entitled to  call psychiatric witnesses  of his\n\nown choosing who, after examining  appellant, could testify as to\n\nhis mental state.\"  United States v.

The  relevance  of additional  expert testimony,  however,\n\nshould have been apparent  from Soldevila's behavior and Attorney\n\nNogueras'  comments  at both  the  competency  hearing and  final\n\nsentencing on May 24 and May 25.  See id.\n                                         \n\n          At the  May 24 hearing, Attorney  Nogueras informed the\n\ncourt that on May 23, he and Attorney Furst went to see Soldevila\n\nat  the MDC  and that  during this  visit, Attorney  Nogueras was\n\nunable \"to get through to [Soldevila]  at all,\" Attorney Nogueras\n\nfound himself completely incapacitated to convey to Soldevila the\n\nmeaning of the upcoming competency hearing, and Soldevila did not\n\nrecognize  Attorney Furst, who had  been his attorney  for a long\n\ntime.\n\n          On May 25, before the district court judge  imposed the\n\nfinal sentence, Attorney  Nogueras informed the court that he had\n\njust asked Soldevila  if he knew what was  going on and Soldevila\n\nsaid no.  At sentencing the following exchange took place:\n\n          THE COURT:  .  . . If he admits  guilt today,\n          he says I am sorry, Judge, for what I did.  I\n          bought those  25 kilos  of cocaine.   He says\n          that,  I will give him the two points.  If he\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\n          doesn't say that, I won't . . . .\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:   I  will ask  my client  that\n          right now.\n\n          THE COURT:  He will have to explain to me why\n          he is sorry.\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:  To be on the record I want, I\n          don't even know if he understands.\n\n          MR.  NOGUERAS:   Well,  let the  record show,\n          your   Honor,  that  I  made  four  different\n          questions to defendant.  One, what  was going\n          on; number  two, did  he buy  cocaine; number\n          three,  does he  know that  he might  get two\n          points reduced  in his sentencing.   He says,\n          no, I don't remember what [sic].\n\n          THE COURT:  Okay.   So, he has no  two points\n          . . . .\n\n(A. 232).\n\n          The continuance  would  have  clearly  been  useful  to\n\nenable Soldevila  to present expert testimony  that might respond\n\nto doctor  Duncan's new allegations  of malingering.

Inconvenience\n                                         \n\n          Undeniably, the prospect of a  continuance implied some\n\ninconvenience to the district court and to doctor Duncan.  Doctor\n\nDuncan  was not  a  local  witness.

Prejudice\n                                       \n\n          In the present case,  Soldevila was unable, without the\n\ncontinuance, to present witnesses of his own choosing  that might\n\nhave  responded to doctor Duncan's new and serious charge that he\n\nwas malingering.

However,  because Soldevila has  a constitutional\n\nright  not  to  be   sentenced  while  incompetent  and  suffered\n\nprejudice as  a  result  of  the  denial  of  his  motion  for  a\n\ncontinuance  and because  a  \"continuance could  have been  brief\n\nenough to cause only  minimal inconvenience, and would have  been\n\nuseful,\"    we conclude  that the  court's denial  of Soldevila's\n\nmotion for  a continuance  was arbitrary and  unreasonable.
