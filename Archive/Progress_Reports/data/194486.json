The government  charged each of\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\nthese appellants with criminal violations of the Bank Records and\n\nForeign Transactions  Act (BRFTA), Pub.  L. No. 91-508,  84 Stat.\n\n1114 (1970)  (codified  as  amended in  various  sections  of  12\n\nU.S.C., 15 U.S.C., and 31 U.S.C.).  Appellant Donovan was charged\n\nwith,  and convicted  of,  failure to  file currency  transaction\n\nreports (CTRs).   See 31 U.S.C.   5313 (1988).  Appellants Aversa\n                     \n\nand Mento were  charged with, and convicted of,  structuring bank\n\ndeposits  to  avoid  triggering  currency  transaction  reporting\n\nrequirements.   See 31 U.S.C.    5324 (1988).  In  each case, the\n                   \n\nunderlying legal  requirement comprises part of  Subchapter II of\n\nthe BRFTA.  Subchapter II's criminal penalty provision, 31 U.S.C.\n\n   5322(a),   proscribes  only   \"willful\"   violations  of   the\n\nsubchapter's provisions.\n\n          A panel of this  court initially heard Donovan's appeal\n\nand  decided it adversely to  him.  We  subsequently withdrew the\n\npanel opinion  and granted  rehearing en banc,  consolidating the\n\nappeal  with appeals involving Aversa and Mento, so that we might\n\nsettle  the meaning of the  term \"willful\" as  used in Subchapter\n\nII.1   The en banc  court now affirms  Donovan's conviction while\n\nvacating  the other  convictions  and remanding  those cases  for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                    \n\n     1The   government   filed   cross-appeals  challenging   the\nrelatively mild sentences imposed  on Mento and Aversa.   In view\nof our disposition  of the issue  before the en  banc court,  the\ncross-appeals  (Nos. 91-1615 and  91-1616) are moot.   They will,\ntherefore, be dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                3\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n          These cases  originated in different ways  and traveled\n\ndifferent  paths to reach our doorstep.  We sketch the background\n\nand then frame the common issue that all three appeals present.\n\n                           A. Donovan.\n                                     \n\n          Donovan, the president  and chief executive  officer of\n\nAtlantic  Trust  Company, a  Boston-based  financial institution,\n\nmoonlighted as a  real estate  developer.  A  friend, Dr.  Edward\n\nSaba,  gave  Donovan  substantial  sums of  cash  to  deposit  at\n\nAtlantic Trust for eventual investment in a New Hampshire housing\n\nsubdivision.   Eschewing Atlantic  Trust's standard  protocol for\n\nrouting  deposits through  tellers, Donovan  personally deposited\n\nSaba's  money  in  five  chunks  of  $30,000,  $92,000,  $30,000,\n\n$55,000, and $30,000, respectively.  Donovan made the deposits at\n\nvarious  times  between  March  13,  1987  and  April  21,  1987.\n\nAlthough  Donovan  was the  bank's legal  compliance officer    a\n\nstatus which presumptively suggests his  familiarity with banking\n\nlaws    he  did  not  prepare CTRs  for  any of  these  deposits.\n\nIndeed, Donovan  fended off his subordinates'  concerns about the\n\nunorthodox way he was handling Saba's cash.\n\n          At trial, Donovan admitted that he was aware of the law\n\nrequiring him to file CTRs for cash  deposits of $10,000 or more,\n\nbut  insisted that  he mistakenly  believed Saba's  deposits came\n\nwithin  one  of  the  law's  exemptions.2    The  district  court\n\n                    \n\n     2\"Deposits  or  withdrawals  of currency  from  an  existing\naccount by an established  depositor who . . .  operates a retail\ntype of  business\" are  exempted from the  reporting requirements\n\n                                4\n\ninstructed  the jury that it was the government's burden to prove\n\nDonovan \"knowingly\"  and \"willfully\"  failed to  file CTRs.   The\n\ncourt twice explained these elements (once during the main charge\n\nand once in answering an inquiry during jury deliberations):\n\n               An act or a  failure to act is knowingly\n          done   if  it   is   done   voluntarily   and\n          intentionally and  not because of  mistake or\n          accident or other innocent reason.  An act or\n          a failure  to act  is done willfully  if done\n          voluntarily  and  intentionally and  with the\n          specific  intent  to  do  something  the  law\n          forbids,  that is  to  say with  bad purpose,\n          either to disobey or disregard the law.\n\nDespite Donovan's importuning, the district court refused to tell\n\nthe jury that any  mistake by Donovan, regardless of  its nature,\n\nwould necessitate acquittal.  The jury found Donovan guilty.\n\n                       B. Aversa and Mento.\n                                          \n\n          Aversa  and  Mento  were  partners  in  a  real  estate\n\nbusiness.  In January 1989, they sold a parcel of land, splitting\n\nthe proceeds.  At the time, Aversa's marriage was foundering.  In\n\norder  to conceal his share of  the profits from his wife, Aversa\n\nasked  Mento to  deposit the  receipts in  Mento's personal  bank\n\naccount  rather than  in  the partners'  joint business  account.\n\nMento  agreed.    Aversa  signed a  statement  acknowledging  his\n\nresponsibility  for one-half of the funds  to insulate Mento from\n\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\n\n          Mento  and Aversa  knew that  Mento's bank  was legally\n\nrequired  to file  CTRs  for all  deposits  of $10,000  or  more.\n\n                    \n\nunder  31 C.F.R.     103.22(b)(2)(i) (1987).    Donovan does  not\ncontend  that  Saba was  an exempt  customer  under this,  or any\nother, section of the regulations.\n\n                                5\n\nFearing  that  the  resultant  paper trail  might  obviate  their\n\nefforts  to hide the cash  from Mrs. Aversa,  the defendants made\n\nserial deposits and withdrawals in sums under $10,000.   Although\n\nboth  men admitted that they knew about the CTR requirement, they\n\nclaimed to be unaware that structuring bank transactions, even if\n\ndesigned to  avoid causing the  bank to file  CTRs, was  itself a\n\ncrime.\n\n          Following the  return  of indictments,  the  government\n\nmoved  in   limine  to  prevent  the   introduction  of  evidence\n                  \n\nsupporting the defendants' mistake-of-law theory.  Judge Loughlin\n\ngranted  the motion.  Aversa then pled guilty to structuring, but\n\ndid so  conditionally, see Fed.  R. Crim. P.  11(a)(2), reserving\n                          \n\nhis mistake-of-law defense  for appeal.   Mento opted for  trial.\n\nAt  the  trial,  the   district  court,  over  timely  objection,\n\ninstructed  the jury  that mistake  of law was  not a  defense to\n\nstructuring.  The jury found Mento guilty.\n\n                      C. The En Banc Issue.\n                                          \n\n          Although these appellants breached different regulatory\n\nprovisions  of  Subchapter  II,  each  was  convicted  under  the\n\nsubchapter's criminal  penalty provision,  31 U.S.C.    5322, and\n\neach  raised a mistake-of-law defense.   We convened  the en banc\n\ncourt specifically to  examine the efficacy  of such defenses  in\n\nthe CTR  and  antistructuring contexts.    At bottom,  this  task\n\nrequires us to elucidate the state of mind that Congress required\n\nwhen it limited such violations to willful misconduct.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n                                6\n\n          We  begin with  an analysis  of the  governing statute,\n\nexploring its interstices  and explicating its meaning.   We then\n\nproceed to tackle the knotty mens rea questions that confront us.\n                                     \n\n                     A. The Statutory Scheme.\n                                            \n\n          In 1970, concerned about the ease with which criminals,\n\nparticularly drug traffickers,  were able to  exchange ill-gotten\n\nprofits for \"clean\"  money, Congress  enacted the  BRFTA.   Among\n\nother things,  Subchapter II  delegated to the  Secretary of  the\n\nTreasury  (the   Secretary)  the  power  to   require  banks  and\n\nindividuals to  file CTRs with the Internal  Revenue Service when\n\ncash  changed  hands.3    See,  e.g.,  31 U.S.C.     5313.    The\n                                    \n\nSecretary  did not  exercise  his delegated  power in  respect to\n\nindividuals, but  required banks  to file CTRs  when transactions\n\ninvolved $10,000 or more.  See 31 C.F.R.   103.22(a)(1) (1989).\n                              \n\n          Although Subchapter II's transaction report requirement\n\nexpanded the armamentarium of  federal law enforcement agents, it\n\nwas too easily circumvented.   Individuals who wished to  avoid a\n\npaper trail for  any reason  could simply segment  large sums  of\n\nmoney  into several  transactions of  less than  $10,000.   In an\n\napparent   effort  to   plug  this  loophole,   Congress  amended\n\n                    \n\n     3Subchapter II has a  number of other regulatory provisions,\nincluding  reporting  requirements  for importing  and  exporting\ncurrency and for foreign currency transactions.  See 31 U.S.C.   \n                                                    \n5313-17.  Congress did  not require that an individual  be guilty\nof  some related  infraction  (say, drug  trafficking) before  he\ncould run afoul of these  currency regulations.  Rather, Congress\nprovided  that individuals who  violate the  currency regulations\nwhile  involved in some other criminal  activity are eligible for\nharsher penalties than those who violate the currency regulations\nalone.  Compare 31 U.S.C.   5322(a) with 31 U.S.C.   5322(b).\n                                        \n\n                                7\n\nSubchapter II  in  1986.   Pub.  L. No.  99-570,  100 Stat.  3207\n\n(1986),  codified at 31 U.S.C.    5324.   The new antistructuring\n                    \n\nprovision  limited  an  individual's  ability to  dodge  the  CTR\n\nrequirement.4  At  the time, Congress considered, but decided not\n\nto  alter, section  5322's  criminal provisions.   Thus,  section\n\n5322,  which  criminalizes   conduct  undertaken  by   a  \"person\n\nwillfully violating  [subchapter II  or a regulation  promulgated\n\nunder Subchapter II],\" applies  to the antistructuring section as\n\nwell as to  the balance  of Subchapter II.   Although  appellants\n\nstand convicted of different offenses   Donovan was found  guilty\n\n                    \n\n     4The amendment read in pertinent part:\n\n          No person  shall for  the purpose  of evading\n          the reporting requirements of section 5313(a)\n          with respect to such transaction -- \n\n                              . . .\n\n               (3)   structure    or   assist   in\n               structuring,    or    attempt    to\n               structure or assist in structuring,\n               any  transaction  with one  or more\n               domestic financial institutions.\n\n31 U.S.C.     5324.   The  regulations implementing  the  statute\nexplained that:\n\n          a person  structures  a  transaction  if  that  person,\n          acting alone, or in conjunction with,  or on behalf of,\n          other persons,  conducts or attempts to  conduct one or\n          more transactions in currency, in any amount, at one or\n          more financial  institutions, on  one or more  days, in\n          any manner,  for the  purpose of evading  the reporting\n          requirements . . . .  \"In any manner\" includes, but  is\n          not  limited to, the breaking  down of a  single sum of\n          currency exceeding $10,000 into smaller sums, including\n          sums  at  or  below  $10,000,   or  the  conduct  of  a\n          transaction,  or  series   of  currency   transactions,\n          including transactions at or below $10,000.\n\n31 C.F.R.   103.11(n) (1989).\n\n                                8\n\nof  violating the  CTR provision while  the other  two appellants\n\nwere convicted of  structuring infractions   they  all argue that\n\nsection 5322's  willfulness requirement  means that, to  be found\n\nguilty,  they must  have  intentionally traversed  a known  legal\n\nduty.  Consequently, they press  a subjective standard of  intent\n\nand  asseverate that  mistake  of law  necessarily constitutes  a\n\ncomplete defense to the charges laid against them.\n\n          The government takes a diametrically opposite view.  It\n\ncontends that, because Congress made  no express provision to the\n\ncontrary, ignorance of the law cannot  serve as a defense to  the\n\ninstant charges.  See generally United States v. Dotterweich, 320\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 277, 284 (1943) (holding that consciousness of wrongdoing is\n\nnot necessary for conviction).  The government's position derives\n\nsome  support  from  an  array  of  appellate  cases  which  have\n\ndisallowed   mistake-of-law   defenses   in   the   transactional\n\nstructuring milieu.   See, e.g.,  United States  v. Ratzlaf,  976\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1280, 1283  (9th Cir.  1992); United States  v.

Under the criminal penalty provision,\n\n31  U.S.C.   5322, violations, to be culpable, must be \"willful.\"\n\nThe Court  has long recognized  that willful  \"is a word  of many\n\nmeanings,  its  construction   often  being  influenced   by  its\n\ncontext.\"  Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 497 (1943).  See\n                                                                 \n\ngenerally  Note, An  Analysis of  the  Term \"Willful\"  in Federal\n                                                                 \n\nCriminal Statutes, 51 Notre Dame L. Rev. 786, 786-87 (1976).\n                 \n\n          Courts   have  coalesced  around  four  definitions  of\n\nwillfulness.  The first,  which is most closely aligned  with the\n\ngovernment's theory here, simply equates \"willful\" with \"knowing\"\n\n(i.e.,  so long as the defendant is  aware of his conduct and the\n     \n\nnature of his circumstances,  no more is necessary).   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

If I were to  have the\n          index  purged, \"wilful\"  would  lead all  the\n          rest  in spite of its being at the end of the\n          alphabet.\n\n          Professor Wechsler:  I  agree with you  Judge\n          Professor Wechsler\n          Hand,  and I  promise you  unequivocally that\n          the word will never be used in the definition\n          of any offense  in the Code.  But  because it\n          is such a  dreadful word and so common in the\n\n                                10\n\nclosely aligned with appellants' position, has its roots in  tax-\n\ncrime  cases.    This   approach  equates  willfulness  with  the\n\nviolation  of a known  legal duty.   See,  e.g., Cheek  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  111 S. Ct. 604, 610 (1991) (discussed infra Part II(D)).\n                                                    \n\nTo our knowledge, no court of appeals has applied either of these\n\nfirst  two definitions  across the  board in connection  with the\n\nentire array of Subchapter II violations.\n\n          Several courts,  however, have taken a  hybrid approach\n\nto the issue  of willfulness  in the purlieus  of Subchapter  II.\n\nThis approach is marked by its protean quality.  Depending on the\n\nlanguage  of  each  particular  regulatory  provision,  the  word\n\n\"willfully\"  as  used  in section  5322  takes  on  a variety  of\n\nmeanings,  allowing mistake of law as a defense to certain crimes\n\nand not to others.  This viewpoint is best typified by Scanio and\n                                                             \n\nits progeny.  See Scanio, 900 F.2d at 490 (permitting mistake-of-\n                        \n\nlaw defense as to  some currency-related crimes while prohibiting\n\nsuch a defense vis-a-vis other currency-related crimes); see also\n                                                                 \n\ncases collected supra at p. 9.\n                     \n\n          We  think that  all three  of these  definitions create\n\nneedless problems.    The  government's  theory  undervalues  the\n\nstatute's  language by reading willfulness as if it were simply a\n\n                    \n\n          regulatory  statutes, it seemed  to me useful\n          to superimpose some norm of meaning on it.\n\nAmerican  Law Institute,  Model Penal  Code    2.20, at  249 n.47\n                                           \n(1985).\n\n                                11\n\nsynonym for  general intent.6   In contrast,  appellants' theory,\n\nif applied across the  board, would allow all mistakes of law, no\n\nmatter   how   unreasonable,  to   serve   as   bucklers  against\n\nprosecution,  and,  in the  bargain,  would  vitiate the  general\n\nprinciple that  \"deliberate ignorance and  positive knowledge are\n\nequally  culpable.\"  United States  v. Jewell, 532  F.2d 697, 700\n                                             \n\n(9th  Cir.),  cert. denied,  426 U.S.  951  (1976).   Last, while\n                          \n\nScanio   and  its   progeny  adopt   a  flexible   definition  of\n      \n\nwillfulness,  they  neither  speak  to   the  mens  rea  for  CTR\n                                                       \n\nviolations  nor answer  the  critical question  of how  differing\n\ndefinitions can attach to a single usage  of an operative term in\n\na single statutory section.\n\n          For  our  part, we  take yet  a  fourth tack     a tack\n\nadumbrated by the course we  set in United States v. Bank  of New\n                                                                 \n\nEngland,  821 F.2d  844 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 484  U.S. 943\n                                                  \n\n(1987).    In  that case,  we  plotted  the intersection  between\n\nsection  5322's  willfulness  criterion  and section  5313's  CTR\n\nrequirements.  See id. at 854-59.  Bank of New England had failed\n                      \n\nto  prepare  CTRs  when   a  customer  repeatedly  withdrew  cash\n\naggregating  over  $10,000  by  means of  multiple  checks,  each\n\nwritten for slightly  under $10,000.  The bank argued that it had\n\nnot  engaged in willful misconduct because it had not \"violated a\n\n                    \n\n     6It is a common rule of statutory interpretation that courts\nmust  give effect  to legislative  terms wherever possible.

We  cite this  familiar tenet because  there would  have\nbeen  no need for Congress to include the term \"willfully\" at all\nif the government's reading of section 5322 were accurate.\n\n                                12\n\nknown  legal duty.\"   Id. at  856.   We rejected  the bank's plea\n                         \n\nbecause  the   evidence  revealed   that  the   bank's  professed\n\nunawareness about whether  the reporting requirements applied  to\n\nthe  transactions   was  a  product  of   the  bank's  deliberate\n\nblindness.  See id. at 856, 857.\n                   \n\n          Our opinion in Bank of New England is not pathbreaking;\n                                            \n\nit  merely represents  a particularized  application of  the rule\n\ndefenestrating  mistake-of-law  defenses  when  the  mistakes  in\n\nquestion result from intentional or reckless disregard of a legal\n\nduty.

We believe that, in respect  to\n\nalleged violations of the  BFTRA's CTR provisions, section 5322's\n\nwillfulness criterion  demands that  the government  prove either\n\nthe violation of a  known legal duty or the reckless disregard of\n\nthe  same.

We explain briefly.\n\n          While  courts have  found on  infrequent occasion  that\n\nCongress intended a word to have different connotations when used\n\nin different  provisions of  the same Act,  see, e.g.,  Greenwood\n                                                                 \n\nTrust  Co. v.

Here,  however,  we  are  not  dealing  with\n\nrepetitions of a word at diverse points in a statute,  but with a\n\nsingle word  in a  single statutory section.   Ascribing  various\n\n                                14\n\nmeanings  to a single  iteration of a  single word    reading the\n\nword  differently for  each code  section to  which it  applies  \n\nwould  open Pandora's  jar.   If  courts  can render  meaning  so\n\nmalleable, the  usefulness of  a single  penalty provision for  a\n\ngroup  of  related  code  sections will  be  eviscerated  and, by\n\nextension,  almost any  code section  that references a  group of\n\nother  code  sections  would become  susceptible  to individuated\n\ninterpretation.\n\n          Furthermore, if Congress wanted  the purposive mens rea\n                                                                 \n\nin  the antistructuring  statute to stand  alone, it  had several\n\nsimple  options.    It  could,   for  example,  have  placed  the\n\nantistructuring provision somewhere other than in Subchapter  II,\n\nor amended the criminal sanctions provision to except structuring\n\nviolations.7   It exercised none of the available options.  Thus,\n\nabsent  powerful  evidence to  the  contrary,  we believe  courts\n\nshould presume that Congress intended the mens rea set by section\n                                                  \n\n5322  to  apply  in equal  measure  to  both  CTR violations  and\n\nstructuring offenses.\n\n          We  recognize,  of course,  that  notwithstanding these\n\nproblems,   several  other   courts  have  scuttled   the  Cowart\n                                                                 \n\npresumption  and  read  the  word  \"willfully\"  in  section  5322\n\ndifferently  as  it applies  to  breaches  of different  currency\n\nregulations.

Scanio,  900 F.2d at  490\n                                              \n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          We must  respectfully disagree with these  courts.  The\n\ndistinction  that   they  draw   simply  does  not   justify  the\n\ntransmogrification  of  the  word  \"willfully\"  into  a statutory\n\nchameleon.   We are, moreover, particularly  chary about adopting\n\nso pleochroic an approach  in light of the more  consistent, less\n\ncomplicated alternative offered  in Bank of New England, 821 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  856.  That alternative, which derives great vitality from the\n\nSupreme Court's  language, see McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133; Trans\n                                                                 \n\nWorld  Airlines,  469 U.S.  at  126, provides  a  fair, workable,\n               \n\nmistake-of-law  defense  to  those  accused  of  currency-related\n\n                                16\n\ncrimes and at  the same time ensures that  defendants who know of\n\nthe  law's requirements  in a  general sense,  but recklessly  or\n\nintentionally fail to investigate  the legality of structuring or\n\nother proscribed activity, will be found guilty.\n\n          We hold, therefore, that  the plain language of section\n\n5322 governs;  that the  unitary willfulness standard  of section\n\n5322  should  be  given  an  identical meaning  with  respect  to\n\nstructuring  and   CTR  violations;8  and  that,   therefore,  an\n\n                    \n\n     8Because this issue is susceptible to resolution in terms of\nthe plain meaning and structure of the statute, we need not probe\nthe  legislative history.

And,  although the House  and Senate\nissued seventeen  reports dealing  with a salmagundi  of proposed\nbills,  features of  which  were amalgamated  into the  Anti-Drug\nAbuse  Act of 1986 (the bill  which contained the antistructuring\nprovision now codified  as 31 U.S.C.   5324), there  was no House\nor Senate  report accompanying  the Act.   See 1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.\n                                              \n5393  (noting  the  absence  of  a  report  but  listing  related\nreports).   To be  sure, the House  considered    and rejected   \nseveral alterations  to section 5322 that would  have changed the\nterm \"willfully\"  to \"knowingly.\"   See, e.g., H.R.Rep.

The  Senate  likewise\nconsidered  legislation  designed  to  make  section   5322  read\n\"knowingly\"  instead of \"willfully.\"  See S. 2683, 99th Cong., 2d\n                                         \nSess.

Cheek, 111 S. Ct. 604 (1991),\n                                         \n\nsignifies that  federal courts  should apply a  purely subjective\n\nstandard to virtually all white-collar crimes that require a mens\n                                                                 \n\nrea of willfulness as an element of the offense.  Such a standard\n   \n\ndiffers from the standard we endorse today because it would allow\n\nmistakes born  of intentional  or reckless ignorance  to insulate\n\ndefendants from  criminal liability.   Donovan's case illustrates\n\nthe practical effect  of this  suggestion:  had  the trial  judge\n\ndefined willfulness  exclusively in terms of  a subjective intent\n\nto  disobey the law, the jury might have exonerated the defendant\n\non  the basis  of  a genuine,  albeit reckless,  misunderstanding\n\nabout the law's requirements.\n\n          We do not  think that  Cheek can carry  the cargo  that\n                                      \n\n                    \n\nupon \"reckless  disregard\" of the law.   See S. Rep.  No. 99-433,\n                                            \n99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 8 (1986).  The amendment failed.\n\n          We see no point in reciting additional  book and verse.\nThe  most serviceable  conclusion  that  can  be woven  from  the\nlanguage   in   the  sundry   reports   attached   to  ultimately\nunsuccessful legislation  is that,  during the extended  drafting\nand redrafting of various bills respecting currency transactions,\nCongress,  or at least some of its members, reconsidered the mens\n                                                                 \nrea  of section 5322, assessed its relationship with the proposed\n   \nantistructuring provision, and elected not to act.\n\n                                18\n\nappellants load  upon it.9  Cheek  was a criminal tax  case.  The\n                                 \n\nCourt  noted that the term  \"willfully,\" as used  in criminal tax\n\nstatutes, had long been interpreted \"as carving out  an exception\n\nto the traditional  rule\" that  ignorance of the  law affords  no\n\ndefense  to a  criminal prosecution.   Id.  at 609.   Nowhere  in\n                                          \n\nCheek,  or in  the  Court's earlier  opinions involving  criminal\n     \n\nprosecutions  under  the tax  laws, see,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nPomponio, 429  U.S.  10 (1976)  (per  curiam); United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nBishop, 412 U.S. 346  (1973); United States v.

Rather, the Cheek Court repeatedly\n                                                \n\nqualified its discussion of the point by referring to the special\n\ncontext   criminal tax prosecutions   from  whence the discussion\n\nproceeded.   See,  e.g., Cheek,  111  S. Ct.  at 609,  610.   The\n                              \n\nCourt's earlier opinions  stressed the  same point.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nPomponio, 429 U.S. at 12 &amp; n.3; Bishop, 412 U.S. at 360-61.  This\n                                      \n\nrepeated qualification makes  clear that the Court  has crafted a\n\nnarrow  exception,  limited to  tax  cases,  in which  subjective\n\nmistake of law can constitute an absolute defense.\n\n          Such   a   conclusion   coheres  with   our   long-held\n\n                    \n\n     9Our dissenting brother suggests  that it is unnecessary for\nus to discuss the range of Cheek.   See post at 33.  We disagree.\n                                            \nIf  the Cheek rationale extended beyond the boundaries of the tax\n             \ncode,  as appellants  claim it  does, the  result we  reach today\nwould be altered, at least as  to appellant Aversa.  Moreover, it\nis  essential  to any  careful  understanding  of section  5322's\nwillfulness  standard  that we  consider,  and  account for,  the\nCourt's explication of  a parallel problem arising under  the tax\ncode.\n\n                                19\n\nunderstanding of the  tax-crime exception.   In United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nAitken,  755  F.2d  188  (1st Cir.  1985),  we  acknowledged  the\n      \n\nuniqueness of the tax  statutes' mens rea requirements.   See id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 193 (\"That internal  revenue reporting and filing requirements\n\nare  an enclave  apart  is  recognized.\").    We  read  Cheek  as\n                                                             \n\nconfirming and fortifying the stance that we took in Aitken.\n                                                           \n\n          Moreover,  and finally,  the  rationales  supporting  a\n\nsubjective mistake-of-law defense in tax-crime cases do not apply\n\nto laws and regulations of the kind at issue here.  As the Second\n\nCircuit noted, \"[o]ne  of the most esoteric  areas of the  law is\n\nthat  of  federal  taxation.   It  is  replete  with  'full-grown\n\nintricacies,'  and it is rare that a 'simple, direct statement of\n\nthe law can be  made without caveat.'\"   United States v.  Regan,\n                                                                \n\n937  F.2d 823, 827 (citation omitted), modified, 946 F.2d 188 (2d\n                                               \n\nCir. 1991), cert. denied,  112 St. Ct. 2273 (1992).   The federal\n                        \n\ntax  code is not only enormous, detailed, and technical, but also\n\ninterrelated and highly nuanced.  Simply reading the words of the\n\ntax  code does  not  always reveal  the  line between  legal  and\n\nillegal conduct.  And for over sixty years, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that  Congress does not intend to  punish those who, in good\n\nfaith, stray past that line.\n\n          For  these reasons, we join  the courts of appeals that\n\nhave   found  the   Cheek  doctrine   inapplicable  to   criminal\n                         \n\nprosecutions  under the  currency reporting  laws.10   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     10Attempts to  expand Cheek's  horizons have  been regularly\n                                \nrejected  in  most other  contexts as  well.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Hollis, 971 F.2d 1441, 1451 (10th Cir. 1992) (rejecting\n                \n\n                                20\n\nUnited  States v. Beaumont, 972  F.2d 91, 94-95  (5th Cir. 1992);\n                          \n\nBrown, 954 F.2d at  1569 n.2; Caming, 968  F.2d at 241;  Dashney,\n                                                                \n\n937  F.2d at 539-40.  The currency statutes are comparatively few\n\nin number, target a much narrower range of conduct, and under the\n\ncurrent  regulations affect a  considerably smaller constituency.\n\nThe  regulatory  scheme,  overall,   is  not  intricate  or  even\n\nespecially subtle.  We  think these distinctions are dispositive.\n\nAccordingly, we  reaffirm Aitken  and continue to  hold that  the\n                                \n\nCheek  exception is restricted to  tax crimes.   In a prosecution\n     \n\nbrought under  Subchapter II, as we have  explained, the criminal\n\nintent required for conviction is either the violation of a known\n\nlegal  duty or  reckless  disregard of  the  law.   Consequently,\n\nappellants' requests  for the application of  a wholly subjective\n\nstandard were properly denied by Judges Loughlin and Devine.\n\nIII. APPLYING THE LAW\n\n          All that remains  is for us to apply the  fruits of our\n\nanalysis to each appellant's situation.\n\n                           A.  Donovan.\n                                      \n\n          In Donovan's case, the  trial judge instructed the jury\n\nthat Donovan's actions were willful if he had the \"bad purpose to\n\n                    \n\nextension  of Cheek to loan fraud context); United States v.

A few courts, however, particularly\nthose  faced  with cases  involving  the  willful destruction  of\ngovernment property,  have applied  a Cheek-like standard.   See,\n                                                                \ne.g.,  United  States v.  Mills, 835  F.2d  1262, 1265  (8th Cir.\n                               \n1987); United States  v.

Moreover, Donovan's requested instruction focused on bad\n\nmotive    and the Cheek  Court made clear  that a showing  of bad\n                       \n\nmotive is more  restrictive than necessary,  even under the  tax-\n\ncrime standard.  See Cheek, 111 S. Ct. at 610; see also Pomponio,\n                                                                \n\n429  U.S.  at 13.    Finally, the  judge  allowed the  parties to\n\nintroduce  evidence  pertaining   to  Donovan's  state  of   mind\n\nregarding the law and the facts.\n\n          The  trial court   which, in  instructing the jury, had\n\nno obligation to  parrot the precise  language favored by  either\n\nside   gave  a charge  that, viewed in  its entirety,  adequately\n\nexplained  the legal  issues, including  every legitimate  theory\n\nupon which Donovan's defense  could rest.  No more  was exigible.\n\nSee United  States v. McGill,  953 F.2d 10,  13 (1st  Cir. 1992);\n                            \n\nUnited States v.

This is  especially true\n             \n\nwhere,   as  here,  the   defendant's  subjective  mistake-of-law\n\nproposal went well beyond what the law requires in its insistence\n\nupon proof of  evil motive.  See,  e.g., United States v.  David,\n                                                                \n\n940  F.2d 722,  738 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (holding that  the district\n\ncourt  may   appropriately  refuse   to  give  a   proposed  jury\n\ninstruction \"which  is  incorrect, misleading,  or incomplete  in\n\nsome material respect\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 605, 908, 1298,\n                                     \n\n                                22\n\n2301 (1992).\n\n                      B.  Aversa and Mento.\n                                          \n\n          We find the remaining appeals to be cut  from different\n\ncloth.  Because of restrictive rulings made below, neither Aversa\n\nnor  Mento ever had a chance to present a mistake-of-law defense.\n\nBoth of them were precluded by the government's successful motion\n\nin limine from offering any evidence as to their ignorance of the\n         \n\nantistructuring law.  Additionally,  in Mento's case the district\n\njudge  charged the  jury  that mistake  of  law was  no  defense,\n\ndeclaring:  \"It  is not  necessary that the  United States  prove\n\nthat  the defendant  knew that  the structuring  of his  currency\n\ntransactions was unlawful.\"\n\n          Since  neither  of these  defendants  were afforded  an\n\nopportunity to develop the  record, and since both of  them claim\n\nnot to have  known that what they did was  illegal, we cannot say\n\nwhat a fully amplified  record might show regarding  Aversa's and\n\nMento's   familiarity   with,  or   actual   knowledge   of,  the\n\nantistructuring law.11   Similarly, we  cannot say how  the proof\n\nmight  shape up  in respect to  reckless disregard  or deliberate\n\nblindness.  It follows inexorably  that, on this scumbled record,\n\nAversa's and Mento's convictions cannot stand.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    In  the  context  of  the\n\nantistructuring and CTR provisions of Subchapter II, we find that\n\n                    \n\n     11We do  know,  however,  that  in the  plea  agreement  the\ngovernment stipulated that it had no evidence of actual knowledge\non Aversa's part.\n\n                                23\n\na willful action  is one committed in violation  of a known legal\n\nduty or  in consequence  of a  defendant's reckless  disregard of\n\nsuch a duty.  In Donovan's case, the introduction of evidence was\n\nnot unduly restricted and the district court's charge to the jury\n\nwas  adequate to  comport with  the proper  standard.   Thus, his\n\nappeal fails.12  Because neither Aversa nor Mento had a chance to\n\npresent  evidence on  a  mistake-of-law theory,  and because  the\n\ntrial  court's jury  instruction  in Mento's  case was  harmfully\n\nerroneous,  their convictions  must  be vacated  and their  cases\n\nremanded for further  proceedings.  By the terms of Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(a)(2), Aversa  may, if  he so elects,  withdraw his  guilty\n\nplea in  the court below.   See United States v.  Lyons, 898 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n210, 214 n.5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.

Hence, we reinstate that\nopinion in redacted form, expressly adopting Part IV thereof.\n\n                                24\n\n             BREYER,  Chief Judge (concurring).  I believe that\n                                 \n\n   criminal prosecutions  for \"currency law\" violations, of the\n\n   sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions\n\n   for  tax law violations.   Compare 26 U.S.C.     6050I, 7203\n                                     \n\n   with  31  U.S.C.     5322,  5324.   Both  sets  of  laws are\n       \n\n   technical;  and  both  sets  of  laws sometimes  criminalize\n\n   conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral\n\n   or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the\n\n   unfair  result  of  criminally prosecuting  individuals  who\n\n   subjectively  and  honestly  believe  they  have  not  acted\n\n   criminally.   United States v. Cheek, 111 S. Ct. 604 (1991),\n                                       \n\n   sets forth  a legal standard  that, by requiring  proof that\n\n   the defendant  was subjectively aware of the  duty at issue,\n\n   would avoid such  unfair results.  Were I writing on a blank\n\n   slate, the similarity of the two sets of criminal laws might\n\n   well  lead me  to conclude  that the  same  standards should\n\n   apply  in both sets of cases.  Other circuits, however, have\n\n   distinguished \"currency reporting\" cases from Cheek.  See en\n                                                            \n\n   banc  opinion,  supra at  p.  20.   Moreover,  Supreme Court\n                        \n\n   opinions have  strongly  suggested that  criminal tax  cases\n\n   constitute  a  separate enclave  in the  law.   See  en banc\n                                                      \n\n   opinion, supra at pp. 18-19.\n                 \n\n                                25\n\n             In  addition, the court today announces a standard\n\n   that  does not threaten  to allow conviction  of a defendant\n\n   with an innocent state of mind.  Under the court's standard,\n\n   the  government   must  prove  that  the   defendant  either\n\n   subjectively  knew  of  his  legal  duty,  or  that  he  was\n\n   \"reckless\"  in respect to the  existence of that  duty.  Cf.\n                                                               \n\n   McLaughlin  v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. at 135 n.13 (even\n                                   \n\n   objectively unreasonable failure to determine  correct legal\n\n   obligation is not \"willful,\"  as long as such failure  falls\n\n   short  of  recklessness).   One  can  imagine  how a  person\n\n   frequently in contact  with these laws, such as  a financial\n\n   officer or  drug-fund courier, could  be found to  have been\n\n   \"reckless\"   in  failing  to   learn  relevant  legal  data.\n\n   However, it is  difficult to  see how one  could convict  an\n\n   ordinary  citizen on  this  basis, i.e.,  in the  absence of\n                                          \n\n   actual,  subjective  knowledge  of   the  legal  duty,   for\n\n   \"recklessness\"   involves  the  conscious   disregard  of  a\n\n   substantial risk.  See  Model Penal Code   2.02(2)(c)(1985);\n                         \n\n   cf.  United  States v.

I therefore join the court's opinion.\n\n                         Dissent follows  \n\n                                27\n\n          TORRUELLA,  Circuit Judge  (Dissenting).    Although  I\n                                   \n\nagree with  much of what is stated by the majority, and even more\n\nwith Chief Judge Breyer's concurrence, I write separately because\n\nI  believe neither  opinion  goes far  enough.   In  my  view the\n\nprosecution of these  cases is defective on two grounds:   (1) As\n\nclearly reflected  in the legislative history  of these statutes,\n\nappellants are  improper targets of money laundering accusations,\n\nand  (2)  even if  the charges  are  within statutory  scope, the\n\nstandard of scienter  in Cheek v.  United States, 498  U.S.   192\n                                                \n\n(1991), is applicable to them.\n\n            I.

In\n\nfact,  particularly in  the case of appellants Aversa  and Mento,\n\nthey did nothing prior to  the alleged \"structuring\" actions that\n\neven  approximates the commission of a criminal offense.  I focus\n\non the Bank Secrecy Act and its more recent amendment,  the Money\n\nLaundering Control  Act, to determine whether appellants' actions\n\nare within the purview  of the conduct that Congress  intended to\n\ncriminalize by this legislation.\n\n                               -28-\n                                28\n\n          The  Bank Secrecy Act, enacted in 1970, was part of the\n\nBank  Records and  Foreign  Transaction Act.13   The  unequivocal\n\nconcern  of this complex legislation  was to prohibit  the use of\n\nforeign banks to  \"launder\" the proceeds  of illegal activity  or\n\nevade  federal  income taxes.14    It  became apparent,  however,\n\nthat  these enactments  had  little impact  on large-scale  money\n\nlaundering related to illegal drug transactions, and that illicit\n\nfunds  were flowing  in  ever-increasing  amounts into  financial\n\ninstitutions  in the  United  States.15   As  a result,  Congress\n\nenacted  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act  of 1986,16 Title  I, subtitle H\n\nof which was  the Money  Laundering Control  Act of  1986.   This\n\nsubtitle included an anti-structuring provision.17\n\n          One  thing clearly emerges from the legislative history\n\nof this  statute:   Congress  wished to  attack money  laundering\n\nassociated  with organized  crime or  related criminal  activity,\n\nparticularly the illicit  drug trade.  See S. Rep.  No. 433, 99th\n                                          \n\nCong., 2d Sess. (1986)  (accompanying S. 2683).

The first major\n\nheading   of  this   report  is   \"Drug  Trafficking   and  Money\n\nLaundering.\"   Id.  at  p.  16.   The  report  refers  to  \"money\n                  \n\nlaundering\" approximately 73 times,  and to  organized  crime and\n\nillegal drug trafficking 53 times.\n\n          Given  the  congressional   preoccupation  with   money\n\nlaundering  it  is  surprising   that  neither  the  term  \"money\n\nlaundering,\" nor  the new crime  created by the  Money Laundering\n\nControl  Act,   \"structuring,\"  are  defined   by  the   statute.\n\nNevertheless, the House Report states the following:\n\n            Money    Laundering   Defined.    -   The\n                                         \n            President's Commission on Organized Crime\n            has  defined  money  laundering   as  the\n            \"process  by  which   one  conceals   the\n            existence,  illegal  source,  or  illegal\n            application of income, and then disguises\n            that   income   to    make   it    appear\n            legitimate.\"  In other  words, laundering\n            involves  the hiding  of the  paper trail\n            that  connects  income  or  money  with a\n            person in order for such person to  evade\n                                                     \n            the payment of taxes,  avoid prosecution,\n                                                     \n            or obviate any forfeiture of  his illegal\n                                                     \n            drug income or assets. . . .\n                                 \n\nId. at 16 (emphasis supplied).\n   \n\n          I  derive additional  guidance  from the  Senate Report\n\nthat discusses what later became 18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(1), which is\n\nentitled Laundering of Monetary Instruments.

Villa,  A Critical  View of  Bank  Secrecy Act\n                                                                 \n\nEnforcement and the Money Laundering Statute, 37 Cath.  U.L. Rev.\n                                            \n\n489  (1988).    The present  appeals  are  living  proof of  that\n\nprophecy.  Appellants  are being prosecuted for violation  of the\n\nmoney laundering  statutes notwithstanding  that they are  not in\n\nany way involved in such activities.\n\n          The situation presented by  these charges is not unlike\n\nthat in  McNally v. United States, 483  U.S. 350 (1987), in which\n                                 \n\nthe Supreme Court  reversed a unanimous  litany of circuit  court\n\n                               -33-\n                                33\n\ndecisions18  condoning the  extension of  the federal  mail fraud\n\nstatute19 beyond  the scope of  Congress' intended coverage.   In\n\ncharging  appellants  under  the  money laundering  statutes  the\n\ngovernment similarly overlooked that \"[i]n considering  the scope\n\nof [a] statute it  is essential to remember Congress'  purpose in\n\nenacting it.\"  Id. at 365 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n                  \n\n          In prosecuting appellants under the Bank Secrecy Act as\n\namended by the  Money Laundering Control Act, the  government has\n\ntransgressed  Congress'   purpose  in  the  enactment   of  these\n\nstatutes,   which   was   to   detect   and   punish   \"financial\n\ntransaction[s]  represent[ing]  the  proceeds  of  some  form  of\n\nunlawful activity,\" 18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(1).  We should  not stand\n\nidly  while  this overreaching  transforms  common citizens  into\n\ncriminals.\n\n                     II.  THE CHEEK STANDARD\n                                            \n\n          While it could  have been  possible to  leave Cheek  v.\n                                                             \n\nUnited States, 498 U.S. 192,  111 S. Ct. 604 (1991), out  of this\n             \n\nappeal  altogether, the  majority opinion  seeks to  restrict its\n\npresent and future use by preemptive  action.  I believe it would\n\nbe more appropriate to consider one case at a time.  Furthermore,\n\nlest there be any doubt, I certainly am not  of the view that the\n\nCheek standard should  apply in blanket fashion \"to virtually all\n     \n\nwhite collar crimes that require a mens rea of willfulness as  an\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n18  Including some from  this circuit.  See, e.g., United  States\n                                                                 \nv.

In  my view  each\n                                   \n\nlegislative  scheme  must  be separately  pondered  to  determine\n\nwhether Cheek applies.  But I cannot agree that because Cheek was\n                                                             \n\nan income tax  case that the principle espoused therein regarding\n\nmens rea  is necessarily limited to  such tax cases.   I can find\n        \n\nnothing in  Cheek to  justify such  a  conclusion or  limitation.\n                 \n\nLogic  and  fundamental  fairness dictate  that  some traditional\n\nlegal  maxims, up to now  blindly accepted, make  little sense in\n\nthe context  of some of today's  complex regulatory environments.\n\nUltimately  Cheek stands for the proposition that at some point a\n                 \n\nlegal fiction  may so depart from reality as to be untenable as a\n\nbasis for criminal responsibility.\n\n          In  Cheek, the  Supreme Court  examined the  meaning of\n                   \n\n\"willfully\" as used in the income tax statutes.  Defendant Cheek,\n\na commercial  airline pilot, refused  to file income  tax returns\n\nafter 1979.   As a  result, Cheek  was indicted and  charged with\n\nwillfully violating 26 U.S.C.    7203 &amp; 7201.20\n\n          At  trial,  Cheek presented  as  his  defense that  \"he\n\nsincerely    believed   that    the    tax   laws    were   being\n\nunconstitutionally enforced and that his actions during 1980-1986\n\nperiod were lawful.\"  Cheek, 498 U.S. at    ,  111 S. Ct. at 607.\n                           \n\nDuring  deliberations,  the jury  was  divided  on whether  Cheek\n\nhonestly  and reasonably believed that he was not required to pay\n\n                    \n\n20  Section  7201 criminalizes  the \"willful[]  attempt[] in  any\nmanner to  evade or defeat any  tax imposed by this  title or the\npayment thereof.\"  26  U.S.C.   7201.  Section  7203 criminalizes\nthe willful failure to file a return as required under Title 26.\n\n                               -35-\n                                35\n\nincome taxes.   However, the district  court instructed the  jury\n\n\"that  a good-faith misunderstanding of  the law or  a good faith\n\nbelief that  one is  not violating  the law, if  it is  to negate\n\nwillfulness,  must be objectively reasonable.\"   498 U.S. at    ,\n\n111 S. Ct. at 608.  With this instruction in hand, the jury found\n\nCheek guilty  on all counts.   Cheek appealed on  the ground that\n\nthis instruction was erroneous.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\n\n          The Supreme  Court, relying  on its prior  criminal tax\n\nprecedents  interpreting the  word \"willfully,\"  reversed Cheek's\n\nconviction.   It  held that  no matter  how unreasonable  a judge\n\nmight deem Cheek's beliefs, the jury must have the opportunity to\n\nhear them and make the final determination as to whether he had a\n\ngood faith misunderstanding  of the  law or a  good faith  belief\n\nthat he was not violating  the law, thus negating the element  of\n\nwillfulness.  498 U.S. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 610.21\n\n          Cheek establishes  that the government must  prove in a\n               \n\ncriminal  tax case  a \"willful\"  violation, which  requires proof\n\nthat a  defendant voluntarily and intentionally  violated a known\n\nlegal duty.  498 U.S.  at    , 111 S. Ct. at 611.   More in point\n\nwith the present appeals, however, the Court stressed that\n\n            [t]he   proliferation  of   statutes  and\n            regulations   has   sometimes   made   it\n            difficult for the average citizen to know\n            and comprehend  the extent of  the duties\n\n                    \n\n21   The Court therefore held that  the district court erred when\nit instructed the jury that  Cheek's \"asserted beliefs that wages\nare not income and that he was not a taxpayer  within the meaning\nof the Internal Revenue Code should not be considered by the jury\nin determining whether Cheek  has acted willfully.\"  498  U.S. at\n   , 111 S. Ct. at 613.\n\n                               -36-\n                                36\n\n            and  obligations imposed by the tax laws.\n            Congress  has  accordingly  softened  the\n            impact of the  common-law presumption  by\n            making specific intent to violate the law\n            an  element  of certain  federal criminal\n            tax offenses.\n\n498 U.S. at    ,  111 S. Ct. at 609.   The Court could  well have\n\nbeen talking about the  arcane money laundering regulatory scheme\n\npresented by these appeals.\n\n          It  is pointed out that the application of Cheek to the\n                                                          \n\nanti-structuring  statute was  rejected by  the Tenth  Circuit in\n\nUnited States v. Dashney, 937 F.2d 532 (10th Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n60 U.S.L.W.  3343 (1991),  and that  other  courts have  followed\n\nDashney's  analysis.  See United  States v. Brown,  954 F.2d 1563\n                                                 \n\n(11th  Cir. 1992); United States v. Rogers, No. 91-5106, slip op.\n                                          \n\n(4th Cir. Apr. 24, 1992).\n\n          In   Dashney,  the  court   concluded  that  the  anti-\n                      \n\nstructuring  act did not require,  as an element  of the offense,\n\nproof  of a  specific  intent to  violate  the act  because,  the\n\nprovisions of the anti-structuring act are \"straightforward\" when\n\ncompared  to  the  criminal  tax  statutes  at  issue  in  Cheek.\n                                                                \n\nDashney, 937 F.2d at  540.  After spending a  considerable amount\n       \n\nof time studying these statutes and regulations, as well as their\n\nlegislative history, I must confess to a different view.\n\n          The conclusion that engaging in a currency  transaction\n\nis  more \"straightforward\" than filing an income tax return is at\n\nbest,   unconvincing.    The  legal duty  at  issue  here --  the\n\nillegality of  structuring a transaction  in order  to prevent  a\n\nbank from filing a  currency transaction report -- does  not even\n\n                               -37-\n                                37\n\napproximate  the general  knowledge of the  duty of  taxpayers to\n\nfile  an income  tax return.22   The  statutes criminalizing  the\n\nconduct of failing to file an income tax  return have been around\n\nfor more than 70  years whereas the anti-structuring act  did not\n\nclearly criminalize the conduct of structuring transactions until\n\n1986, when Congress  enacted 31  U.S.C.    5324 and  5522.23   If\n\nnothing  else emerges from a study of this byzantine labyrinth of\n\nlegislation  and regulation,  it is  that an  unsuspecting common\n\ncitizen can easily  fall prey to  this uncommon area of  the law.\n\nApparently, with  this in mind the  Treasury Department proposed,\n\nbut  failed  to  adopt,  regulations  aimed  at  publicizing  the\n\ncriminal  offense underlying    5324.   See  54 Fed.  Reg. 20,398\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n22  In Cheek, Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Marshall joined\n            \nin dissent, stated that:\n\n            [I]t  is incomprehensible  to me  how, in\n            this day,  more than 70  years after  the\n            institution of our present federal income\n            tax  system  .   .  .  any   taxpayer  of\n            competent  mentality  can  assert as  his\n            defense    to   charges    of   statutory\n            willfulness the proposition that the wage\n            he receives  for his labor is  not income\n            . . . .\n\n498 U.S. at    , 111 S.

In\n\nmy  opinion,  in case  No.  91-1574,  appellant Donovan  received\n\nsubstantially  the  jury charge  that  he was  entitled  to under\n\nCheek.

The government  charged each of\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\nthese appellants with criminal violations of the Bank Records and\n\nForeign Transactions  Act (BRFTA), Pub.  L. No. 91-508,  84 Stat.\n\n1114 (1970)  (codified  as  amended in  various  sections  of  12\n\nU.S.C., 15 U.S.C., and 31 U.S.C.).  Appellant Donovan was charged\n\nwith,  and convicted  of,  failure to  file currency  transaction\n\nreports (CTRs).   See 31 U.S.C.   5313 (1988).  Appellants Aversa\n                     \n\nand Mento were  charged with, and convicted of,  structuring bank\n\ndeposits  to  avoid  triggering  currency  transaction  reporting\n\nrequirements.   See 31 U.S.C.    5324 (1988).  In  each case, the\n                   \n\nunderlying legal  requirement comprises part of  Subchapter II of\n\nthe BRFTA.  Subchapter II's criminal penalty provision, 31 U.S.C.\n\n   5322(a),   proscribes  only   \"willful\"   violations  of   the\n\nsubchapter's provisions.\n\n          A panel of this  court initially heard Donovan's appeal\n\nand  decided it adversely to  him.  We  subsequently withdrew the\n\npanel opinion  and granted  rehearing en banc,  consolidating the\n\nappeal  with appeals involving Aversa and Mento, so that we might\n\nsettle  the meaning of the  term \"willful\" as  used in Subchapter\n\nII.1   The en banc  court now affirms  Donovan's conviction while\n\nvacating  the other  convictions  and remanding  those cases  for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                    \n\n     1The   government   filed   cross-appeals  challenging   the\nrelatively mild sentences imposed  on Mento and Aversa.   In view\nof our disposition  of the issue  before the en  banc court,  the\ncross-appeals  (Nos. 91-1615 and  91-1616) are moot.   They will,\ntherefore, be dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                3\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n          These cases  originated in different ways  and traveled\n\ndifferent  paths to reach our doorstep.  We sketch the background\n\nand then frame the common issue that all three appeals present.\n\n                           A. Donovan.\n                                     \n\n          Donovan, the president  and chief executive  officer of\n\nAtlantic  Trust  Company, a  Boston-based  financial institution,\n\nmoonlighted as a  real estate  developer.  A  friend, Dr.  Edward\n\nSaba,  gave  Donovan  substantial  sums of  cash  to  deposit  at\n\nAtlantic Trust for eventual investment in a New Hampshire housing\n\nsubdivision.   Eschewing Atlantic  Trust's standard  protocol for\n\nrouting  deposits through  tellers, Donovan  personally deposited\n\nSaba's  money  in  five  chunks  of  $30,000,  $92,000,  $30,000,\n\n$55,000, and $30,000, respectively.  Donovan made the deposits at\n\nvarious  times  between  March  13,  1987  and  April  21,  1987.\n\nAlthough  Donovan  was the  bank's legal  compliance officer    a\n\nstatus which presumptively suggests his  familiarity with banking\n\nlaws    he  did  not  prepare CTRs  for  any of  these  deposits.\n\nIndeed, Donovan  fended off his subordinates'  concerns about the\n\nunorthodox way he was handling Saba's cash.\n\n          At trial, Donovan admitted that he was aware of the law\n\nrequiring him to file CTRs for cash  deposits of $10,000 or more,\n\nbut  insisted that  he mistakenly  believed Saba's  deposits came\n\nwithin  one  of  the  law's  exemptions.2    The  district  court\n\n                    \n\n     2\"Deposits  or  withdrawals  of currency  from  an  existing\naccount by an established  depositor who . . .  operates a retail\ntype of  business\" are  exempted from the  reporting requirements\n\n                                4\n\ninstructed  the jury that it was the government's burden to prove\n\nDonovan \"knowingly\"  and \"willfully\"  failed to  file CTRs.   The\n\ncourt twice explained these elements (once during the main charge\n\nand once in answering an inquiry during jury deliberations):\n\n               An act or a  failure to act is knowingly\n          done   if  it   is   done   voluntarily   and\n          intentionally and  not because of  mistake or\n          accident or other innocent reason.  An act or\n          a failure  to act  is done willfully  if done\n          voluntarily  and  intentionally and  with the\n          specific  intent  to  do  something  the  law\n          forbids,  that is  to  say with  bad purpose,\n          either to disobey or disregard the law.\n\nDespite Donovan's importuning, the district court refused to tell\n\nthe jury that any  mistake by Donovan, regardless of  its nature,\n\nwould necessitate acquittal.  The jury found Donovan guilty.\n\n                       B. Aversa and Mento.\n                                          \n\n          Aversa  and  Mento  were  partners  in  a  real  estate\n\nbusiness.  In January 1989, they sold a parcel of land, splitting\n\nthe proceeds.  At the time, Aversa's marriage was foundering.  In\n\norder  to conceal his share of  the profits from his wife, Aversa\n\nasked  Mento to  deposit the  receipts in  Mento's personal  bank\n\naccount  rather than  in  the partners'  joint business  account.\n\nMento  agreed.    Aversa  signed a  statement  acknowledging  his\n\nresponsibility  for one-half of the funds  to insulate Mento from\n\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\n\n          Mento  and Aversa  knew that  Mento's bank  was legally\n\nrequired  to file  CTRs  for all  deposits  of $10,000  or  more.\n\n                    \n\nunder  31 C.F.R.     103.22(b)(2)(i) (1987).    Donovan does  not\ncontend  that  Saba was  an exempt  customer  under this,  or any\nother, section of the regulations.\n\n                                5\n\nFearing  that  the  resultant  paper trail  might  obviate  their\n\nefforts  to hide the cash  from Mrs. Aversa,  the defendants made\n\nserial deposits and withdrawals in sums under $10,000.   Although\n\nboth  men admitted that they knew about the CTR requirement, they\n\nclaimed to be unaware that structuring bank transactions, even if\n\ndesigned to  avoid causing the  bank to file  CTRs, was  itself a\n\ncrime.\n\n          Following the  return  of indictments,  the  government\n\nmoved  in   limine  to  prevent  the   introduction  of  evidence\n                  \n\nsupporting the defendants' mistake-of-law theory.  Judge Loughlin\n\ngranted  the motion.  Aversa then pled guilty to structuring, but\n\ndid so  conditionally, see Fed.  R. Crim. P.  11(a)(2), reserving\n                          \n\nhis mistake-of-law defense  for appeal.   Mento opted for  trial.\n\nAt  the  trial,  the   district  court,  over  timely  objection,\n\ninstructed  the jury  that mistake  of law was  not a  defense to\n\nstructuring.  The jury found Mento guilty.\n\n                      C. The En Banc Issue.\n                                          \n\n          Although these appellants breached different regulatory\n\nprovisions  of  Subchapter  II,  each  was  convicted  under  the\n\nsubchapter's criminal  penalty provision,  31 U.S.C.    5322, and\n\neach  raised a mistake-of-law defense.   We convened  the en banc\n\ncourt specifically to  examine the efficacy  of such defenses  in\n\nthe CTR  and  antistructuring contexts.    At bottom,  this  task\n\nrequires us to elucidate the state of mind that Congress required\n\nwhen it limited such violations to willful misconduct.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\n                                6\n\n          We  begin with  an analysis  of the  governing statute,\n\nexploring its interstices  and explicating its meaning.   We then\n\nproceed to tackle the knotty mens rea questions that confront us.\n                                     \n\n                     A. The Statutory Scheme.\n                                            \n\n          In 1970, concerned about the ease with which criminals,\n\nparticularly drug traffickers,  were able to  exchange ill-gotten\n\nprofits for \"clean\"  money, Congress  enacted the  BRFTA.   Among\n\nother things,  Subchapter II  delegated to the  Secretary of  the\n\nTreasury  (the   Secretary)  the  power  to   require  banks  and\n\nindividuals to  file CTRs with the Internal  Revenue Service when\n\ncash  changed  hands.3    See,  e.g.,  31 U.S.C.     5313.    The\n                                    \n\nSecretary  did not  exercise  his delegated  power in  respect to\n\nindividuals, but  required banks  to file CTRs  when transactions\n\ninvolved $10,000 or more.  See 31 C.F.R.   103.22(a)(1) (1989).\n                              \n\n          Although Subchapter II's transaction report requirement\n\nexpanded the armamentarium of  federal law enforcement agents, it\n\nwas too easily circumvented.   Individuals who wished to  avoid a\n\npaper trail for  any reason  could simply segment  large sums  of\n\nmoney  into several  transactions of  less than  $10,000.   In an\n\napparent   effort  to   plug  this  loophole,   Congress  amended\n\n                    \n\n     3Subchapter II has a  number of other regulatory provisions,\nincluding  reporting  requirements  for importing  and  exporting\ncurrency and for foreign currency transactions.  See 31 U.S.C.   \n                                                    \n5313-17.  Congress did  not require that an individual  be guilty\nof  some related  infraction  (say, drug  trafficking) before  he\ncould run afoul of these  currency regulations.  Rather, Congress\nprovided  that individuals who  violate the  currency regulations\nwhile  involved in some other criminal  activity are eligible for\nharsher penalties than those who violate the currency regulations\nalone.  Compare 31 U.S.C.   5322(a) with 31 U.S.C.   5322(b).\n                                        \n\n                                7\n\nSubchapter II  in  1986.   Pub.  L. No.  99-570,  100 Stat.  3207\n\n(1986),  codified at 31 U.S.C.    5324.   The new antistructuring\n                    \n\nprovision  limited  an  individual's  ability to  dodge  the  CTR\n\nrequirement.4  At  the time, Congress considered, but decided not\n\nto  alter, section  5322's  criminal provisions.   Thus,  section\n\n5322,  which  criminalizes   conduct  undertaken  by   a  \"person\n\nwillfully violating  [subchapter II  or a regulation  promulgated\n\nunder Subchapter II],\" applies  to the antistructuring section as\n\nwell as to  the balance  of Subchapter II.   Although  appellants\n\nstand convicted of different offenses   Donovan was found  guilty\n\n                    \n\n     4The amendment read in pertinent part:\n\n          No person  shall for  the purpose  of evading\n          the reporting requirements of section 5313(a)\n          with respect to such transaction -- \n\n                              . . .\n\n               (3)   structure    or   assist   in\n               structuring,    or    attempt    to\n               structure or assist in structuring,\n               any  transaction  with one  or more\n               domestic financial institutions.\n\n31 U.S.C.     5324.   The  regulations implementing  the  statute\nexplained that:\n\n          a person  structures  a  transaction  if  that  person,\n          acting alone, or in conjunction with,  or on behalf of,\n          other persons,  conducts or attempts to  conduct one or\n          more transactions in currency, in any amount, at one or\n          more financial  institutions, on  one or more  days, in\n          any manner,  for the  purpose of evading  the reporting\n          requirements . . . .  \"In any manner\" includes, but  is\n          not  limited to, the breaking  down of a  single sum of\n          currency exceeding $10,000 into smaller sums, including\n          sums  at  or  below  $10,000,   or  the  conduct  of  a\n          transaction,  or  series   of  currency   transactions,\n          including transactions at or below $10,000.\n\n31 C.F.R.   103.11(n) (1989).\n\n                                8\n\nof  violating the  CTR provision while  the other  two appellants\n\nwere convicted of  structuring infractions   they  all argue that\n\nsection 5322's  willfulness requirement  means that, to  be found\n\nguilty,  they must  have  intentionally traversed  a known  legal\n\nduty.  Consequently, they press  a subjective standard of  intent\n\nand  asseverate that  mistake  of law  necessarily constitutes  a\n\ncomplete defense to the charges laid against them.\n\n          The government takes a diametrically opposite view.  It\n\ncontends that, because Congress made  no express provision to the\n\ncontrary, ignorance of the law cannot  serve as a defense to  the\n\ninstant charges.  See generally United States v.

Depending on the\n\nlanguage  of  each  particular  regulatory  provision,  the  word\n\n\"willfully\"  as  used  in section  5322  takes  on  a variety  of\n\nmeanings,  allowing mistake of law as a defense to certain crimes\n\nand not to others.  This viewpoint is best typified by Scanio and\n                                                             \n\nits progeny.

Here,  however,  we  are  not  dealing  with\n\nrepetitions of a word at diverse points in a statute,  but with a\n\nsingle word  in a  single statutory section.   Ascribing  various\n\n                                14\n\nmeanings  to a single  iteration of a  single word    reading the\n\nword  differently for  each code  section to  which it  applies  \n\nwould  open Pandora's  jar.   If  courts  can render  meaning  so\n\nmalleable, the  usefulness of  a single  penalty provision for  a\n\ngroup  of  related  code  sections will  be  eviscerated  and, by\n\nextension,  almost any  code section  that references a  group of\n\nother  code  sections  would become  susceptible  to individuated\n\ninterpretation.\n\n          Furthermore, if Congress wanted  the purposive mens rea\n                                                                 \n\nin  the antistructuring  statute to stand  alone, it  had several\n\nsimple  options.    It  could,   for  example,  have  placed  the\n\nantistructuring provision somewhere other than in Subchapter  II,\n\nor amended the criminal sanctions provision to except structuring\n\nviolations.7   It exercised none of the available options.  Thus,\n\nabsent  powerful  evidence to  the  contrary,  we believe  courts\n\nshould presume that Congress intended the mens rea set by section\n                                                  \n\n5322  to  apply  in equal  measure  to  both  CTR violations  and\n\nstructuring offenses.\n\n          We  recognize,  of course,  that  notwithstanding these\n\nproblems,   several  other   courts  have  scuttled   the  Cowart\n                                                                 \n\npresumption  and  read  the  word  \"willfully\"  in  section  5322\n\ndifferently  as  it applies  to  breaches  of different  currency\n\nregulations.

To\n\nwarrant  redefining \"willfully\"  from crime  to crime  within the\n\nsame  statute,  these  courts  generally  attempt to  distinguish\n\nantistructuring   regulations   from,  say,   currency  importing\n\nregulations,  on the  basis of  the \"reasonable  probability that\n\nknowledge  [of the  law] might  be obtained\"  more easily  in the\n\nformer situation  than in the  latter.  Scanio,  900 F.2d at  490\n                                              \n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          We must  respectfully disagree with these  courts.  The\n\ndistinction  that   they  draw   simply  does  not   justify  the\n\ntransmogrification  of  the  word  \"willfully\"  into  a statutory\n\nchameleon.   We are, moreover, particularly  chary about adopting\n\nso pleochroic an approach  in light of the more  consistent, less\n\ncomplicated alternative offered  in Bank of New England, 821 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  856.  That alternative, which derives great vitality from the\n\nSupreme Court's  language, see McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133; Trans\n                                                                 \n\nWorld  Airlines,  469 U.S.  at  126, provides  a  fair, workable,\n               \n\nmistake-of-law  defense  to  those  accused  of  currency-related\n\n                                16\n\ncrimes and at  the same time ensures that  defendants who know of\n\nthe  law's requirements  in a  general sense,  but recklessly  or\n\nintentionally fail to investigate  the legality of structuring or\n\nother proscribed activity, will be found guilty.\n\n          We hold, therefore, that  the plain language of section\n\n5322 governs;  that the  unitary willfulness standard  of section\n\n5322  should  be  given  an  identical meaning  with  respect  to\n\nstructuring  and   CTR  violations;8  and  that,   therefore,  an\n\n                    \n\n     8Because this issue is susceptible to resolution in terms of\nthe plain meaning and structure of the statute, we need not probe\nthe  legislative history.

And,  although the House  and Senate\nissued seventeen  reports dealing  with a salmagundi  of proposed\nbills,  features of  which  were amalgamated  into the  Anti-Drug\nAbuse  Act of 1986 (the bill  which contained the antistructuring\nprovision now codified  as 31 U.S.C.   5324), there  was no House\nor Senate  report accompanying  the Act.

Such a standard\n   \n\ndiffers from the standard we endorse today because it would allow\n\nmistakes born  of intentional  or reckless ignorance  to insulate\n\ndefendants from  criminal liability.   Donovan's case illustrates\n\nthe practical effect  of this  suggestion:  had  the trial  judge\n\ndefined willfulness  exclusively in terms of  a subjective intent\n\nto  disobey the law, the jury might have exonerated the defendant\n\non  the basis  of  a genuine,  albeit reckless,  misunderstanding\n\nabout the law's requirements.\n\n          We do not  think that  Cheek can carry  the cargo  that\n                                      \n\n                    \n\nupon \"reckless  disregard\" of the law.

The amendment failed.\n\n          We see no point in reciting additional  book and verse.\nThe  most serviceable  conclusion  that  can  be woven  from  the\nlanguage   in   the  sundry   reports   attached   to  ultimately\nunsuccessful legislation  is that,  during the extended  drafting\nand redrafting of various bills respecting currency transactions,\nCongress,  or at least some of its members, reconsidered the mens\n                                                                 \nrea  of section 5322, assessed its relationship with the proposed\n   \nantistructuring provision, and elected not to act.\n\n                                18\n\nappellants load  upon it.9  Cheek  was a criminal tax  case.

The federal\n                        \n\ntax  code is not only enormous, detailed, and technical, but also\n\ninterrelated and highly nuanced.  Simply reading the words of the\n\ntax  code does  not  always reveal  the  line between  legal  and\n\nillegal conduct.  And for over sixty years, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that  Congress does not intend to  punish those who, in good\n\nfaith, stray past that line.\n\n          For  these reasons, we join  the courts of appeals that\n\nhave   found  the   Cheek  doctrine   inapplicable  to   criminal\n                         \n\nprosecutions  under the  currency reporting  laws.10   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     10Attempts to  expand Cheek's  horizons have  been regularly\n                                \nrejected  in  most other  contexts as  well.

Aversa and Mento.\n                                          \n\n          We find the remaining appeals to be cut  from different\n\ncloth.  Because of restrictive rulings made below, neither Aversa\n\nnor  Mento ever had a chance to present a mistake-of-law defense.\n\nBoth of them were precluded by the government's successful motion\n\nin limine from offering any evidence as to their ignorance of the\n         \n\nantistructuring law.  Additionally,  in Mento's case the district\n\njudge  charged the  jury  that mistake  of  law was  no  defense,\n\ndeclaring:  \"It  is not  necessary that the  United States  prove\n\nthat  the defendant  knew that  the structuring  of his  currency\n\ntransactions was unlawful.\"\n\n          Since  neither  of these  defendants  were afforded  an\n\nopportunity to develop the  record, and since both of  them claim\n\nnot to have  known that what they did was  illegal, we cannot say\n\nwhat a fully amplified  record might show regarding  Aversa's and\n\nMento's   familiarity   with,  or   actual   knowledge   of,  the\n\nantistructuring law.11   Similarly, we  cannot say how  the proof\n\nmight  shape up  in respect to  reckless disregard  or deliberate\n\nblindness.  It follows inexorably  that, on this scumbled record,\n\nAversa's and Mento's convictions cannot stand.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    In  the  context  of  the\n\nantistructuring and CTR provisions of Subchapter II, we find that\n\n                    \n\n     11We do  know,  however,  that  in the  plea  agreement  the\ngovernment stipulated that it had no evidence of actual knowledge\non Aversa's part.\n\n                                23\n\na willful action  is one committed in violation  of a known legal\n\nduty or  in consequence  of a  defendant's reckless  disregard of\n\nsuch a duty.  In Donovan's case, the introduction of evidence was\n\nnot unduly restricted and the district court's charge to the jury\n\nwas  adequate to  comport with  the proper  standard.   Thus, his\n\nappeal fails.12  Because neither Aversa nor Mento had a chance to\n\npresent  evidence on  a  mistake-of-law theory,  and because  the\n\ntrial  court's jury  instruction  in Mento's  case was  harmfully\n\nerroneous,  their convictions  must  be vacated  and their  cases\n\nremanded for further  proceedings.  By the terms of Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(a)(2), Aversa  may, if  he so elects,  withdraw his  guilty\n\nplea in  the court below.   See United States v.

Under the court's standard,\n\n   the  government   must  prove  that  the   defendant  either\n\n   subjectively  knew  of  his  legal  duty,  or  that  he  was\n\n   \"reckless\"  in respect to the  existence of that  duty.

In\n\nfact,  particularly in  the case of appellants Aversa  and Mento,\n\nthey did nothing prior to  the alleged \"structuring\" actions that\n\neven  approximates the commission of a criminal offense.  I focus\n\non the Bank Secrecy Act and its more recent amendment,  the Money\n\nLaundering Control  Act, to determine whether appellants' actions\n\nare within the purview  of the conduct that Congress  intended to\n\ncriminalize by this legislation.\n\n                               -28-\n                                28\n\n          The  Bank Secrecy Act, enacted in 1970, was part of the\n\nBank  Records and  Foreign  Transaction Act.13   The  unequivocal\n\nconcern  of this complex legislation  was to prohibit  the use of\n\nforeign banks to  \"launder\" the proceeds  of illegal activity  or\n\nevade  federal  income taxes.14    It  became apparent,  however,\n\nthat  these enactments  had  little impact  on large-scale  money\n\nlaundering related to illegal drug transactions, and that illicit\n\nfunds  were flowing  in  ever-increasing  amounts into  financial\n\ninstitutions  in the  United  States.15   As  a result,  Congress\n\nenacted  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act  of 1986,16 Title  I, subtitle H\n\nof which was  the Money  Laundering Control  Act of  1986.   This\n\nsubtitle included an anti-structuring provision.17\n\n          One  thing clearly emerges from the legislative history\n\nof this  statute:   Congress  wished to  attack money  laundering\n\nassociated  with organized  crime or  related criminal  activity,\n\nparticularly the illicit  drug trade.  See S. Rep.  No. 433, 99th\n                                          \n\nCong., 2d Sess. (1986)  (accompanying S. 2683).

Id.   The House Report\n                                              \n\ndisplays  a similar preoccupation.   See H.R. Rep.

The first major\n\nheading   of  this   report  is   \"Drug  Trafficking   and  Money\n\nLaundering.\"   Id.  at  p.  16.   The  report  refers  to  \"money\n                  \n\nlaundering\" approximately 73 times,  and to  organized  crime and\n\nillegal drug trafficking 53 times.\n\n          Given  the  congressional   preoccupation  with   money\n\nlaundering  it  is  surprising   that  neither  the  term  \"money\n\nlaundering,\" nor  the new crime  created by the  Money Laundering\n\nControl  Act,   \"structuring,\"  are  defined   by  the   statute.\n\nNevertheless, the House Report states the following:\n\n            Money    Laundering   Defined.    -   The\n                                         \n            President's Commission on Organized Crime\n            has  defined  money  laundering   as  the\n            \"process  by  which   one  conceals   the\n            existence,  illegal  source,  or  illegal\n            application of income, and then disguises\n            that   income   to    make   it    appear\n            legitimate.\"  In other  words, laundering\n            involves  the hiding  of the  paper trail\n            that  connects  income  or  money  with a\n            person in order for such person to  evade\n                                                     \n            the payment of taxes,  avoid prosecution,\n                                                     \n            or obviate any forfeiture of  his illegal\n                                                     \n            drug income or assets. . . .\n                                 \n\nId. at 16 (emphasis supplied).\n   \n\n          I  derive additional  guidance  from the  Senate Report\n\nthat discusses what later became 18 U.S.C.   1956(a)(1), which is\n\nentitled Laundering of Monetary Instruments.

As a  result, Cheek  was indicted and  charged with\n\nwillfully violating 26 U.S.C.    7203 &amp; 7201.20\n\n          At  trial,  Cheek presented  as  his  defense that  \"he\n\nsincerely    believed   that    the    tax   laws    were   being\n\nunconstitutionally enforced and that his actions during 1980-1986\n\nperiod were lawful.\"  Cheek, 498 U.S. at    ,  111 S. Ct. at 607.\n                           \n\nDuring  deliberations,  the jury  was  divided  on whether  Cheek\n\nhonestly  and reasonably believed that he was not required to pay\n\n                    \n\n20  Section  7201 criminalizes  the \"willful[]  attempt[] in  any\nmanner to  evade or defeat any  tax imposed by this  title or the\npayment thereof.\"  26  U.S.C.   7201.  Section  7203 criminalizes\nthe willful failure to file a return as required under Title 26.\n\n                               -35-\n                                35\n\nincome taxes.   However, the district  court instructed the  jury\n\n\"that  a good-faith misunderstanding of  the law or  a good faith\n\nbelief that  one is  not violating  the law, if  it is  to negate\n\nwillfulness,  must be objectively reasonable.\"   498 U.S. at    ,\n\n111 S. Ct. at 608.  With this instruction in hand, the jury found\n\nCheek guilty  on all counts.   Cheek appealed on  the ground that\n\nthis instruction was erroneous.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\n\n          The Supreme  Court, relying  on its prior  criminal tax\n\nprecedents  interpreting the  word \"willfully,\"  reversed Cheek's\n\nconviction.   It  held that  no matter  how unreasonable  a judge\n\nmight deem Cheek's beliefs, the jury must have the opportunity to\n\nhear them and make the final determination as to whether he had a\n\ngood faith misunderstanding  of the  law or a  good faith  belief\n\nthat he was not violating  the law, thus negating the element  of\n\nwillfulness.  498 U.S. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 610.21\n\n          Cheek establishes  that the government must  prove in a\n               \n\ncriminal  tax case  a \"willful\"  violation, which  requires proof\n\nthat a  defendant voluntarily and intentionally  violated a known\n\nlegal duty.  498 U.S.  at    , 111 S. Ct. at 611.   More in point\n\nwith the present appeals, however, the Court stressed that\n\n            [t]he   proliferation  of   statutes  and\n            regulations   has   sometimes   made   it\n            difficult for the average citizen to know\n            and comprehend  the extent of  the duties\n\n                    \n\n21   The Court therefore held that  the district court erred when\nit instructed the jury that  Cheek's \"asserted beliefs that wages\nare not income and that he was not a taxpayer  within the meaning\nof the Internal Revenue Code should not be considered by the jury\nin determining whether Cheek  has acted willfully.\"  498  U.S. at\n   , 111 S. Ct. at 613.\n\n                               -36-\n                                36\n\n            and  obligations imposed by the tax laws.\n            Congress  has  accordingly  softened  the\n            impact of the  common-law presumption  by\n            making specific intent to violate the law\n            an  element  of certain  federal criminal\n            tax offenses.\n\n498 U.S. at    ,  111 S. Ct. at 609.   The Court could  well have\n\nbeen talking about the  arcane money laundering regulatory scheme\n\npresented by these appeals.\n\n          It  is pointed out that the application of Cheek to the\n                                                          \n\nanti-structuring  statute was  rejected by  the Tenth  Circuit in\n\nUnited States v.

Apr. 24, 1992).\n\n          In   Dashney,  the  court   concluded  that  the  anti-\n                      \n\nstructuring  act did not require,  as an element  of the offense,\n\nproof  of a  specific  intent to  violate  the act  because,  the\n\nprovisions of the anti-structuring act are \"straightforward\" when\n\ncompared  to  the  criminal  tax  statutes  at  issue  in  Cheek.\n                                                                \n\nDashney, 937 F.2d at  540.  After spending a  considerable amount\n       \n\nof time studying these statutes and regulations, as well as their\n\nlegislative history, I must confess to a different view.\n\n          The conclusion that engaging in a currency  transaction\n\nis  more \"straightforward\" than filing an income tax return is at\n\nbest,   unconvincing.    The  legal duty  at  issue  here --  the\n\nillegality of  structuring a transaction  in order  to prevent  a\n\nbank from filing a  currency transaction report -- does  not even\n\n                               -37-\n                                37\n\napproximate  the general  knowledge of the  duty of  taxpayers to\n\nfile  an income  tax return.22   The  statutes criminalizing  the\n\nconduct of failing to file an income tax  return have been around\n\nfor more than 70  years whereas the anti-structuring act  did not\n\nclearly criminalize the conduct of structuring transactions until\n\n1986, when Congress  enacted 31  U.S.C.    5324 and  5522.23   If\n\nnothing  else emerges from a study of this byzantine labyrinth of\n\nlegislation  and regulation,  it is  that an  unsuspecting common\n\ncitizen can easily  fall prey to  this uncommon area of  the law.\n\nApparently, with  this in mind the  Treasury Department proposed,\n\nbut  failed  to  adopt,  regulations  aimed  at  publicizing  the\n\ncriminal  offense underlying    5324.   See  54 Fed.  Reg. 20,398\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n22  In Cheek, Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Marshall joined\n            \nin dissent, stated that:\n\n            [I]t  is incomprehensible  to me  how, in\n            this day,  more than 70  years after  the\n            institution of our present federal income\n            tax  system  .   .  .  any   taxpayer  of\n            competent  mentality  can  assert as  his\n            defense    to   charges    of   statutory\n            willfulness the proposition that the wage\n            he receives  for his labor is  not income\n            . . . .\n\n498 U.S. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 615.\n\n23  In  fact, until the enactment of the  Money Laundering Act, a\nconflict among the circuits existed as  to whether it was a crime\nto structure deposits for the purpose of preventing the bank from\nreporting.
