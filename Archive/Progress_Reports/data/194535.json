At his jury trial, defendant\n                              \n\nJoseph S. Benevides was convicted of conspiracy to transfer a\n\nfirearm  illegally.    On  appeal,  defendant  challenges the\n\nsufficiency   of  the  evidence  supporting  his  conviction.\n\nFinding  sufficient evidence  to sustain  the  conviction, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          We summarize the evidence in a light most favorable\n\nto the government.  United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 881\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992).  Defendant was employed at Handy and Harmon\n\nJewelry  Company  (\"Handy  and Harmon\")  in  East Providence,\n\nRhode Island.  On May 15, 1991, Officer Genaro Ramirez of the\n\nEast Providence Police Department began undercover work as an\n\nemployee  of  Handy  and   Harmon.    Although  his  original\n\nassignment was  to investigate complaints of  gold theft from\n\nthe  company,  Ramirez  began  investigating  other  possible\n\ncriminal  activity as  well.   As part of  his investigation,\n\nRamirez told Yee Yang, another employee  of Handy and Harmon,\n\nthat  he was  interested  in purchasing  a  gun for  his  own\n\nprotection.  Soon thereafter, defendant approached Ramirez at\n\nwork  and told  him that  he had  a friend  who could  supply\n\nRamirez with guns.  Defendant mentioned specifically that his\n\nfriend  had a  \"beautiful\"  sawed-off shotgun  that defendant\n\nhimself had consideredpurchasing.  Ramirezexpressed interest.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          On June 27, 1991, defendant advised Ramirez that he\n\nhad  made arrangements for  Ramirez to meet  his friend after\n\nwork.  Ramirez was reluctant  to meet defendant's friend that\n\nday  because  he  had  advised neither  his  supervisors  nor\n\nfederal  officers from  the  Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms  of the  meeting.   Defendant  was very  persistent,\n\nhowever, and for  the sake of the investigation, Ramirez felt\n\nhe had no choice but  to go.  Defendant and Ramirez  drove in\n\nseparate cars to a  liquor store parking lot where  defendant\n\nhad arranged to meet his friend, Hans Lunder (\"Smitty\"). \n\n          Smitty, accompanied  by his  wife,  arrived at  the\n\nparking  lot in a black van.  Defendant introduced Ramirez to\n\nSmitty and  his wife.   After introductions,  defendant asked\n\n\"Why don't you  guys get to business[?]\"  In  the presence of\n\ndefendant, Ramirez told Smitty that he had no money with him,\n\nbut  that  he  was  interested in  purchasing  the  sawed-off\n\nshotgun.  In the course of the  conversation, defendant asked\n\nSmitty  if Smitty had the  shotgun with him.   Smitty replied\n\nthat he did.   Smitty  mentioned that he  could also  provide\n\nRamirez with a .357 handgun, although he did not have it with\n\nhim.  \n\n          Ramirez  then asked  to  see the  shotgun.   Smitty\n\ndisappeared  momentarily and returned.   With defendant still\n\npresent, Smitty told Ramirez  to proceed to a white  car that\n\nwas parked about twenty-five feet away in the parking lot, to\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nget  into the  passenger  side, and  to  \"make it  look  cool\n\nbecause of the cops.\"  \n\n          Ramirez  proceeded   to  the  car   alone,  leaving\n\ndefendant with Smitty and his wife.  Upon getting in the car,\n\nRamirez met William  Dawson.  Dawson showed  Ramirez a sawed-\n\noff  shotgun, and assured him that it functioned.  Dawson and\n\nRamirez agreed on a price of $200 for the gun.   Ramirez told\n\nDawson that  he had no money,  but that when he  was ready to\n\npurchase the gun, he would let Dawson know through defendant.\n\n          Ramirez then returned  without the gun  to Smitty's\n\nvan.  With defendant still  present, Ramirez told Smitty that\n\nhe would  let Smitty  know,  through defendant,  when he  had\n\nenough money to buy the sawed-off shotgun.  \n\n          Less  than  one  month  later, on  July  22,  1991,\n\ndefendant approached Ramirez  and asked him  if he was  still\n\ninterested  in  buying  the  sawed-off shotgun  or  the  .357\n\nhandgun that Smitty had  mentioned.  When Ramirez replied  in\n\nthe  affirmative,  defendant  said  that he  would  make  the\n\nnecessary  arrangements  for  the  purchases  by  telephoning\n\nSmitty.  \n\n          Two days later,  on July  24, defendant  approached\n\nRamirez at work and told  him that the deal had been  set for\n\nthe  following day.  The next day, July 25, defendant advised\n\nRamirez that  the deal was set  for later that day,  but that\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ndefendant  would have to contact  Smitty to make  sure of the\n\ntime and  place of  the meeting.   That afternoon,  defendant\n\napproached Ramirez to tell him that he had spoken with Smitty\n\nand  that Smitty had arranged a meeting for that afternoon at\n\nthe  same liquor  store  parking lot  where  the parties  had\n\npreviously met.    Defendant  stated  that he  would  not  be\n\npresent because he had to buy parts for his truck.  Defendant\n\nsaid that Smitty would not be present either, but that Dawson\n\nwould arrive with both the shotgun and the .357 handgun.  \n\n          Ramirez  arrived alone  at the  parking lot  at the\n\nappointed  time  and  found  Dawson  standing  outside  of  a\n\nminivan.   Dawson  told  Ramirez that  he  had the  sawed-off\n\nshotgun which  Ramirez had previously seen,  and that another\n\nperson,  located  across the  street  from  where Dawson  and\n\nRamirez  were standing,  had the  .357 handgun  which Ramirez\n\ncould purchase.  \n\n          Ramirez began haggling with Dawson about the  price\n\nof the shotgun.   Dawson said that he could  go no lower than\n\n$170 because Smitty  was getting $50  of the purchase  price.\n\nWhen asked whether defendant was receiving any portion of the\n\nmoney, Dawson replied that he was not.  Ramirez purchased the\n\ngun from Dawson for $170. \n\n          After placing the shotgun in  the trunk of his car,\n\nRamirez returned  to Dawson's minivan and  inquired about the\n\n.357  handgun.   Dawson directed  Ramirez across  the street,\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwhere Ramirez met a man named \"Bill\" who showed  him the .357\n\nhandgun.  Ramirez and Bill negotiated a price of $450 for the\n\n.357  handgun.   Subsequently, Bill  departed the  scene, and\n\nthough  Ramirez expected  his return, Bill  never reappeared.\n\nRamirez left without purchasing the handgun.     \n\n          The following day at  work, defendant asked Ramirez\n\nif he had purchased  a gun, and  Ramirez replied that he  had\n\npurchased  the shotgun.  Five days later, on July 31, Ramirez\n\ntold defendant that he had sold the shotgun for a profit.  On\n\nAugust 1, Ramirez told  defendant he was still  interested in\n\nthe .357 handgun.  From a telephone at work, defendant called\n\nSmitty, and handed  the phone to Ramirez.   Smitty apologized\n\nto  Ramirez for  the  disappearance  of  Bill, and  asked  if\n\nRamirez was satisfied with his purchase of the shotgun.  \n\n          On August 9,  1991, defendant  again called  Smitty\n\nfrom  work, and again handed  the phone to  Ramirez.  Ramirez\n\nasked about the .357  handgun, and Smitty told him  that Bill\n\nhad gone to Florida,  and that he  could not get the  handgun\n\nuntil  a later date.  That day, defendant gave Smitty's phone\n\nnumber to Ramirez.\n\n          On October  17, 1991,  defendant was  arrested. The\n\nindictment against defendant  charged him with conspiracy  to\n\ntransfer a  firearm in  violation of  26 U.S.C.     5861(e)1,\n\n                    \n\n1.  26 U.S.C.   5861(e)  makes it unlawful for any  person to\n\"transfer  a firearm in  violation of the  provisions of this\nchapter.\"\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n58112,  and  5812(a)3  of  the National  Firearms  Act  (\"the\n\nAct\"), all in violation of 18 U.S.C.   371.4\n\n                    \n\n2.  26 U.S.C.   5811 provides in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Rate.

The tax imposed  by subsection\n         By  whom paid.\n     (a)  of   this  section   shall  be  paid   by  the\n     transferor.\n\n3.  26 U.S.C.   5812(a) provides:\n\n     A firearm  shall not be transferred  unless (1) the\n     transferor  of  the  firearm  has  filed  with  the\n     Secretary  [of the Treasury] a written application,\n     in duplicate, for the transfer and registration  of\n     the firearm  to the  transferee on  the application\n     form prescribed  by  the  Secretary;  (2)  any  tax\n     payable on the transfer is paid as evidenced by the\n     proper  stamp affixed  to the  original application\n     form;  (3)  the  transferee  is  identified in  the\n     application form  in such  manner as  the Secretary\n     may by regulations prescribe, except that, if  such\n     person  is an  individual, the  identification must\n     include  his fingerprints  and his  photograph; (4)\n     the transferor of the  firearm is identified in the\n     application form  in such  manner as the  Secretary\n     may  by regulations prescribe;  (5) the  firearm is\n     identified in  the application form in  such manner\n     as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe;  and\n     (6) the  application form shows that  the Secretary\n     has approved the  transfer and the  registration of\n     the firearm to the transferee.   Applications shall\n     be denied if the  transfer, receipt, or  possession\n     of  the  firearm  would  place  the  transferee  in\n     violation of the law.\n\n4.  18 U.S.C.   371 provides in relevant part:\n\n     If two  or more  persons conspire either  to commit\n     any  offense  against  the  United  States,  or  to\n     defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in\n     any manner or for  any purpose, and one or  more of\n     such persons do any act to effect the object of the\n     conspiracy,  each  shall  be fined  not  more  than\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          At trial, the government's evidence showed that the\n\ngun  which Ramirez purchased from Dawson was a firearm within\n\nthe  meaning  of  26  U.S.C.      5845(a)(2),5  that  it  was\n\nunregistered,   and  that  it  was  transferred  without  the\n\nrequired application  to transfer and without  payment of the\n\nrequired transfer tax.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Defendant   challenges   the  sufficiency   of  the\n\nevidence  supporting  his  conviction.    More  specifically,\n\ndefendant argues  (1) that  there  was insufficient  evidence\n\nthat  he entered  into an  agreement to  commit the  unlawful\n\n                    \n\n     $10,000 or imprisoned not  more than five years, or\n     both.\n\n5.  26 U.S.C.   5845(a)(2) provides:\n\n     The  term  \"firearm\" means  a  weapon  made from  a\n     shotgun if  such weapon as modified  has an overall\n     length  of  less  than 26  inches  or  a  barrel or\n     barrels of less than 18 inches in length.\n\nThe weapon which was transferred was a modified  shotgun with\nan  overall length of twenty  one and one-half  inches, and a\nbarrel length of twelve and one-half inches.  \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nact,6  and (2) that he was  indifferent to the outcome of the\n\nconspiracy. \n\n          In reviewing  a claim of  insufficient evidence, we\n\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\nand determine  whether a  rational trier  of fact  could have\n\nfound  guilt beyond  a  reasonable doubt.   United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nTejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992).\n      \n\n          \"The  `essence'  of conspiracy  is an  agreement to\n                                                          \n\ncommit a crime.\"   United States v.

Its existence may be proven\n              \n\n                    \n\n6.  In that part  of his  brief which argues  that there  was\ninsufficient evidence of an agreement, defendant also asserts\nthat the  government's evidence failed  to show that  he \"had\nthe  necessary intent to commit the substantive offense.\"  To\nthe  extent that  this statement  is an  attempt to  raise an\nissue  other than  the  sufficiency of  the  evidence, it  is\nplainly inadequate to warrant our review.  We have repeatedly\nwarned  parties that  \"issues  adverted to  in a  perfunctory\nmanner,   unaccompanied   by   some   effort   at   developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"  United States v.

The record  before us\n      \n\ndiscloses ample evidence to support defendant's conviction of\n\nconspiring to transfer a firearm illegally.\n\n          The  government's  evidence  showed that  defendant\n\napproached Ramirez  and told  him  about a  friend who  could\n\nsupply guns, that defendant arranged the first meeting in the\n\nparking lot,  that he persisted  in bringing  Ramirez to  the\n\nfirst meeting, that he arrived at the first meeting and asked\n\nSmitty  whether  Smitty  had  brought the  shotgun,  that  he\n\nremained in  the parking lot with Smitty throughout the first\n\nmeeting, that he approached Ramirez about the second meeting,\n\nthat  he  arranged  the  second  meeting  when  the  gun  was\n\ntransferred, and that he continued  to phone Smitty after the\n\ntransfer.  In our view, such evidence is more than sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable  jury to have inferred  an agreement between\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nSmitty  and  defendant  to  transfer  the  gun  to  Ramirez.7\n\nAccordingly,   we   find  defendant's   sufficiency  argument\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n                    \n\n7.  In  his  motion to  the  district court  for  judgment of\nacquittal,  and  again on  appeal,  defendant  has relied  on\nUnited States  v. Tyler, 758 F.2d  66, 69 (2d Cir.  1985), to\n                       \nargue  that he merely helped a willing buyer locate a willing\nseller.   As  the district  court properly  noted in  denying\ndefendant's motion, however, Tyler differs significantly from\n                                  \nthe case before us. \n     In Tyler, the defendant met an undercover police officer\n             \nwho  expressed an  interest in  purchasing drugs.   Defendant\nTyler then approached drug dealers in the street on behalf of\nthe officer.    Eschewing  the  first dealer  he  met,  Tyler\narranged for  the officer  to purchase heroin  from a  second\ndealer.  There was no evidence that Tyler knew either seller.\nFinding that \"[t]he evidence adduced by the government merely\nshows that  Tyler  helped a  willing buyer  locate a  willing\nseller,\"  id.  at 69,  the  Second  Circuit reversed  Tyler's\n             \nconspiracy   conviction,   reasoning  that   \"such  evidence,\nstanding alone, is insufficient to establish the existence of\n              \nan agreement between [Tyler] and the  seller.\"  Id. (emphasis\n                                                   \nsupplied).  \n     In  the  instant case,  the government's  evidence shows\nthat  defendant  approached  Ramirez   at  work  on   several\noccasions regarding  the  transfer, that  he  placed  several\nphone calls,  arranged two  meetings, and attended  the first\nmeeting.   Therefore, unlike  the spontaneous sale  in Tyler,\n                                                            \nwhich provided  no evidence of an agreement between Tyler and\nthe seller, the record before us presents ample evidence from\nwhich  the  jury  could   have  found  an  agreement  between\ndefendant and Smitty to transfer the shotgun.\n     Defendant further  argues  that the  district court,  in\nreaching its decision that Tyler did not apply, unduly relied\n                                \non  the  government's  assertion that  defendant  \"initiated\"\ndiscussions  about  the  gun.    Our  review of  the  record,\nhowever, shows  that the district court did  not limit itself\nto evidence regarding the  initiation of the sale.   Instead,\nthe district court properly considered all of the evidence of\nan   agreement,  including   defendant's  phone   calls,  his\narrangement of the meetings  and his later conversations with\nRamirez about the transfer, when it denied defendant's motion\nfor judgment of acquittal based on Tyler.\n                                        \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Defendant's second argument suffers a similar fate.\n\nA  conspiracy  conviction  will   not  be  sustained  if  the\n\ngovernment's evidence shows that a defendant \"was indifferent\n\nto the [conspiracy's] outcome  altogether.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nAponte-Suarez,  905  F.2d 483,  491  (1st  Cir. 1990),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  111  S.  Ct. 531  (1990),  111  S.  Ct. 975  (1991).\n      \n\nInstead,  \"[a]n  accused must  `in  some  sense promote  [the\n\nconspiracy] himself, make  it his  own, have a  stake in  its\n\noutcome.'\"  Id. (quoting  United States v. Falcone, 109  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n579, 581 (2d Cir.), aff'd, 311 U.S. 205 (1940)).  In the case\n                         \n\nat bar, there was  evidence that defendant approached Ramirez\n\non  numerous   occasions,  planned  meetings,   persisted  in\n\nbringing them about,  and asked about  the transfer after  it\n\noccurred.  Far from showing indifference, this evidence tends\n\nto  indicate  that defendant  actively promoted  the transfer\n\nwhich  underlies  his  conviction.    Accordingly, we  reject\n\ndefendant's contention that a reasonable jury only could have\n\nfound  that   he  was  indifferent  to  the  outcome  of  the\n\nconspiracy.8 \n\n                    \n\n8.  In arguing  that he  was indifferent to  the conspiracy's\noutcome, defendant relies almost exclusively on the fact that\nhe  received no money for the transfer.  However, a defendant\n\"may  be guilty  of  participation in  a criminal  conspiracy\nwithout actually profiting from or having any financial stake\nin  it.\"  United States v. Alemany  Rivera, 781 F.2d 229, 237\n                                          \nn.9 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1086 (1986).

Simply put, in the face\n                  \nof the  aforementioned evidence,  we do not  find defendant's\nlack of a financial stake in the  sale of the shotgun to be a\nsufficient basis for overturning the jury's verdict.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the foregoing  reasons, defendant's  conviction\n\nis affirmed.

Defendant was employed at Handy and Harmon\n\nJewelry  Company  (\"Handy  and Harmon\")  in  East Providence,\n\nRhode Island.  On May 15, 1991, Officer Genaro Ramirez of the\n\nEast Providence Police Department began undercover work as an\n\nemployee  of  Handy  and   Harmon.    Although  his  original\n\nassignment was  to investigate complaints of  gold theft from\n\nthe  company,  Ramirez  began  investigating  other  possible\n\ncriminal  activity as  well.   As part of  his investigation,\n\nRamirez told Yee Yang, another employee  of Handy and Harmon,\n\nthat  he was  interested  in purchasing  a  gun for  his  own\n\nprotection.  Soon thereafter, defendant approached Ramirez at\n\nwork  and told  him that  he had  a friend  who could  supply\n\nRamirez with guns.  Defendant mentioned specifically that his\n\nfriend  had a  \"beautiful\"  sawed-off shotgun  that defendant\n\nhimself had consideredpurchasing.  Ramirezexpressed interest.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          On June 27, 1991, defendant advised Ramirez that he\n\nhad  made arrangements for  Ramirez to meet  his friend after\n\nwork.  Ramirez was reluctant  to meet defendant's friend that\n\nday  because  he  had  advised neither  his  supervisors  nor\n\nfederal  officers from  the  Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco  and\n\nFirearms  of the  meeting.   Defendant  was very  persistent,\n\nhowever, and for  the sake of the investigation, Ramirez felt\n\nhe had no choice but  to go.  Defendant and Ramirez  drove in\n\nseparate cars to a  liquor store parking lot where  defendant\n\nhad arranged to meet his friend, Hans Lunder (\"Smitty\"). \n\n          Smitty, accompanied  by his  wife,  arrived at  the\n\nparking  lot in a black van.  Defendant introduced Ramirez to\n\nSmitty and  his wife.   After introductions,  defendant asked\n\n\"Why don't you  guys get to business[?]\"  In  the presence of\n\ndefendant, Ramirez told Smitty that he had no money with him,\n\nbut  that  he  was  interested in  purchasing  the  sawed-off\n\nshotgun.  In the course of the  conversation, defendant asked\n\nSmitty  if Smitty had the  shotgun with him.   Smitty replied\n\nthat he did.   Smitty  mentioned that he  could also  provide\n\nRamirez with a .357 handgun, although he did not have it with\n\nhim.  \n\n          Ramirez  then asked  to  see the  shotgun.   Smitty\n\ndisappeared  momentarily and returned.   With defendant still\n\npresent, Smitty told Ramirez  to proceed to a white  car that\n\nwas parked about twenty-five feet away in the parking lot, to\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nget  into the  passenger  side, and  to  \"make it  look  cool\n\nbecause of the cops.\"  \n\n          Ramirez  proceeded   to  the  car   alone,  leaving\n\ndefendant with Smitty and his wife.  Upon getting in the car,\n\nRamirez met William  Dawson.  Dawson showed  Ramirez a sawed-\n\noff  shotgun, and assured him that it functioned.  Dawson and\n\nRamirez agreed on a price of $200 for the gun.   Ramirez told\n\nDawson that  he had no money,  but that when he  was ready to\n\npurchase the gun, he would let Dawson know through defendant.\n\n          Ramirez then returned  without the gun  to Smitty's\n\nvan.  With defendant still  present, Ramirez told Smitty that\n\nhe would  let Smitty  know,  through defendant,  when he  had\n\nenough money to buy the sawed-off shotgun.  \n\n          Less  than  one  month  later, on  July  22,  1991,\n\ndefendant approached Ramirez  and asked him  if he was  still\n\ninterested  in  buying  the  sawed-off shotgun  or  the  .357\n\nhandgun that Smitty had  mentioned.  When Ramirez replied  in\n\nthe  affirmative,  defendant  said  that he  would  make  the\n\nnecessary  arrangements  for  the  purchases  by  telephoning\n\nSmitty.  \n\n          Two days later,  on July  24, defendant  approached\n\nRamirez at work and told  him that the deal had been  set for\n\nthe  following day.  The next day, July 25, defendant advised\n\nRamirez that  the deal was set  for later that day,  but that\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ndefendant  would have to contact  Smitty to make  sure of the\n\ntime and  place of  the meeting.   That afternoon,  defendant\n\napproached Ramirez to tell him that he had spoken with Smitty\n\nand  that Smitty had arranged a meeting for that afternoon at\n\nthe  same liquor  store  parking lot  where  the parties  had\n\npreviously met.    Defendant  stated  that he  would  not  be\n\npresent because he had to buy parts for his truck.  Defendant\n\nsaid that Smitty would not be present either, but that Dawson\n\nwould arrive with both the shotgun and the .357 handgun.  \n\n          Ramirez  arrived alone  at the  parking lot  at the\n\nappointed  time  and  found  Dawson  standing  outside  of  a\n\nminivan.   Dawson  told  Ramirez that  he  had the  sawed-off\n\nshotgun which  Ramirez had previously seen,  and that another\n\nperson,  located  across the  street  from  where Dawson  and\n\nRamirez  were standing,  had the  .357 handgun  which Ramirez\n\ncould purchase.  \n\n          Ramirez began haggling with Dawson about the  price\n\nof the shotgun.   Dawson said that he could  go no lower than\n\n$170 because Smitty  was getting $50  of the purchase  price.\n\nWhen asked whether defendant was receiving any portion of the\n\nmoney, Dawson replied that he was not.  Ramirez purchased the\n\ngun from Dawson for $170. \n\n          After placing the shotgun in  the trunk of his car,\n\nRamirez returned  to Dawson's minivan and  inquired about the\n\n.357  handgun.   Dawson directed  Ramirez across  the street,\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwhere Ramirez met a man named \"Bill\" who showed  him the .357\n\nhandgun.  Ramirez and Bill negotiated a price of $450 for the\n\n.357  handgun.   Subsequently, Bill  departed the  scene, and\n\nthough  Ramirez expected  his return, Bill  never reappeared.\n\nRamirez left without purchasing the handgun.     \n\n          The following day at  work, defendant asked Ramirez\n\nif he had purchased  a gun, and  Ramirez replied that he  had\n\npurchased  the shotgun.  Five days later, on July 31, Ramirez\n\ntold defendant that he had sold the shotgun for a profit.  On\n\nAugust 1, Ramirez told  defendant he was still  interested in\n\nthe .357 handgun.  From a telephone at work, defendant called\n\nSmitty, and handed  the phone to Ramirez.   Smitty apologized\n\nto  Ramirez for  the  disappearance  of  Bill, and  asked  if\n\nRamirez was satisfied with his purchase of the shotgun.  \n\n          On August 9,  1991, defendant  again called  Smitty\n\nfrom  work, and again handed  the phone to  Ramirez.  Ramirez\n\nasked about the .357  handgun, and Smitty told him  that Bill\n\nhad gone to Florida,  and that he  could not get the  handgun\n\nuntil  a later date.  That day, defendant gave Smitty's phone\n\nnumber to Ramirez.\n\n          On October  17, 1991,  defendant was  arrested. The\n\nindictment against defendant  charged him with conspiracy  to\n\ntransfer a  firearm in  violation of  26 U.S.C.     5861(e)1,\n\n                    \n\n1.  26 U.S.C.   5861(e)  makes it unlawful for any  person to\n\"transfer  a firearm in  violation of the  provisions of this\nchapter.\"\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n58112,  and  5812(a)3  of  the National  Firearms  Act  (\"the\n\nAct\"), all in violation of 18 U.S.C.   371.4\n\n                    \n\n2.  26 U.S.C.   5811 provides in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Rate.

The record  before us\n      \n\ndiscloses ample evidence to support defendant's conviction of\n\nconspiring to transfer a firearm illegally.\n\n          The  government's  evidence  showed that  defendant\n\napproached Ramirez  and told  him  about a  friend who  could\n\nsupply guns, that defendant arranged the first meeting in the\n\nparking lot,  that he persisted  in bringing  Ramirez to  the\n\nfirst meeting, that he arrived at the first meeting and asked\n\nSmitty  whether  Smitty  had  brought the  shotgun,  that  he\n\nremained in  the parking lot with Smitty throughout the first\n\nmeeting, that he approached Ramirez about the second meeting,\n\nthat  he  arranged  the  second  meeting  when  the  gun  was\n\ntransferred, and that he continued  to phone Smitty after the\n\ntransfer.

As  the district  court properly  noted in  denying\ndefendant's motion, however, Tyler differs significantly from\n                                  \nthe case before us. \n     In Tyler, the defendant met an undercover police officer\n             \nwho  expressed an  interest in  purchasing drugs.   Defendant\nTyler then approached drug dealers in the street on behalf of\nthe officer.    Eschewing  the  first dealer  he  met,  Tyler\narranged for  the officer  to purchase heroin  from a  second\ndealer.  There was no evidence that Tyler knew either seller.\nFinding that \"[t]he evidence adduced by the government merely\nshows that  Tyler  helped a  willing buyer  locate a  willing\nseller,\"  id.  at 69,  the  Second  Circuit reversed  Tyler's\n             \nconspiracy   conviction,   reasoning  that   \"such  evidence,\nstanding alone, is insufficient to establish the existence of\n              \nan agreement between [Tyler] and the  seller.\"  Id.

Therefore, unlike  the spontaneous sale  in Tyler,\n                                                            \nwhich provided  no evidence of an agreement between Tyler and\nthe seller, the record before us presents ample evidence from\nwhich  the  jury  could   have  found  an  agreement  between\ndefendant and Smitty to transfer the shotgun.\n     Defendant further  argues  that the  district court,  in\nreaching its decision that Tyler did not apply, unduly relied\n                                \non  the  government's  assertion that  defendant  \"initiated\"\ndiscussions  about  the  gun.    Our  review of  the  record,\nhowever, shows  that the district court did  not limit itself\nto evidence regarding the  initiation of the sale.   Instead,\nthe district court properly considered all of the evidence of\nan   agreement,  including   defendant's  phone   calls,  his\narrangement of the meetings  and his later conversations with\nRamirez about the transfer, when it denied defendant's motion\nfor judgment of acquittal based on Tyler.\n                                        \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Defendant's second argument suffers a similar fate.\n\nA  conspiracy  conviction  will   not  be  sustained  if  the\n\ngovernment's evidence shows that a defendant \"was indifferent\n\nto the [conspiracy's] outcome  altogether.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nAponte-Suarez,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543061\"><a href=\"/opinion/543061/united-states-v-emigdio-aponte-suarez-united-states-of-america-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  491  (1st  Cir. 1990),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  111  S.
