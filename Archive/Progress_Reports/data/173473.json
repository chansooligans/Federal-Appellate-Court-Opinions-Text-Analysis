D. Brock. Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William Maselli was on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 17, 2010\n\f             LYNCH, Chief Judge.              In November 2008, Robert Donath\n\nagreed to plead guilty to three counts charging his participation\n\nin a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and other drugs in the small\n\ntown of Lincoln, Maine.               As part of his plea agreement, Donath\n\nexpressly waived his right to appeal his plea or sentence if it did\n\nnot exceed 120 months.            The district court accepted Donath's plea\n\nand    sentenced     him    to    a   below-guidelines      term    of   90   months'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n             Nonetheless, Donath appeals, urging that his appeals\n\nwaiver is unenforceable and that the district court erred when\n\ncalculating his sentence by mischaracterizing his prior crimes. He\n\nsays that error constituted a miscarriage of justice, which excuses\n\nhis waiver of appeal.            We find the waiver enforceable and dismiss\n\nthe appeal.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             Donath was indicted in September 2008 with fifteen other\n\nsuspected participants in the drug conspiracy.                      The indictment\n\ncharged     Donath    in    three      counts,   alleging    (1)    conspiracy      to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or\n\nmore   of   cocaine,       50    grams   or   more   of   cocaine    base,    and   an\n\nunspecified quantity of oxycodone; (2) conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and\n\n5 grams or more of cocaine base; and (3) a separate conspiracy\n\nto distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fmore of cocaine and 5 grams or more of cocaine base; all in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.\n\n            Two months later, in early November 2008, Donath reached\n\nan agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to all counts\n\nagainst him. Donath's written plea agreement described the charges\n\nand   the   penalties     he   faced.     As   detailed    in   the   agreement,\n\nconviction on Count 1 carried a mandatory minimum of ten years'\n\nimprisonment with a maximum sentence of life in prison; conviction\n\non Counts 2 and 3 meant a mandatory                minimum of five years'\n\nimprisonment with a maximum sentence of forty years in prison. The\n\nagreement also specified fines, special assessments, and supervised\n\nrelease terms associated with the charges.\n\n            In    exchange     for   Donath's    guilty    plea   and   further\n\ncooperation, the government agreed to recommend that the court give\n\nDonath a three-level offense-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. section 3E1.1.\n\n            The   plea    agreement     included   an     explicit    waiver   of\n\nDonath's right to appeal his plea or sentence, which read, in\n\nrelevant part,\n\n            Appeal Waivers. Defendant is aware that Title 18,\n            United States Code, Section 3742 affords a\n            defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed.\n            Knowing that, Defendant waives the right to appeal\n            the following:\n\n                     A.      Defendant's guilty plea and any other\n                             aspect of Defendant's conviction in the\n                             above-captioned case; and\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                      B.     A sentence of imprisonment that does\n                             not exceed 120 months.\n            . . . .\n\n                   The number of months mentioned in this\n            paragraph does not necessarily constitute an\n            estimate of the sentence that the parties expect\n            will be imposed.\n\nThe agreement was not conditioned on, and in fact did not mention,\n\nthe issue of Donath's eligibility for 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)'s \"safety\n\nvalve\"    adjustment.         Under   that     provision,   a   court   may     give\n\ndefendants who meet certain conditions, among them that they \"not\n\nhave more than 1 criminal history point,\" a reduction from an\n\notherwise mandatory minimum sentence.1              Id. § 3553(f)(1).\n\n            Donath signed the agreement on November 5, 2008, as did\n\nhis   counsel,    who      affirmed   that,    to   his   knowledge,    \"Donath's\n\ndecision   to    enter     into   this   Agreement    [wa]s     an   informed    and\n\nvoluntary one.\"\n\n            As part of this agreement, which was put on the public\n\ndocket, Donath also signed a supplemental agreement, which provided\n\nhim with letter immunity in exchange for his \"full and truthful\n\ncooperation.\"      This agreement was put under seal, presumably to\n\nprotect Donath.     The supplemental agreement expressly incorporated\n\n\n\n      1\n          The \"other conditions are that the defendant not use\nviolence or possess a weapon, that the offense not result in death\nor serious injury, that the defendant not organize the offense or\nengage in a continuing criminal enterprise, and that the defendant\ncooperate with the government.\" United States v. Maldonado, No.\n09-1626, 2010 WL 2898250, at *1 n.1 (1st Cir. July 26, 2010)\n(citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(2)-(5)).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe terms of the publicly filed agreement.            The government further\n\nagreed to \"make known [Donath's] cooperation\" upon Donath's request\n\nbut   did   not   commit   the   government   to     seeking   a   safety-valve\n\nreduction.        Donath thus knew that if the court at sentencing\n\nassigned him more than one criminal-history point he would be\n\nineligible for safety-valve relief. He also knew that there was no\n\nagreement on this and that he had waived his right to appeal any\n\nsentence the court would impose of 120 months or fewer.\n\n            On February 25, 2009, Donath pled guilty in the district\n\ncourt.      During   Donath's    plea    colloquy,    he   confirmed   that   he\n\nunderstood the terms and conditions of his plea agreement and that\n\nthe agreement was not binding on the court as to sentencing\n\nguidelines calculations.         The district court explicitly detailed\n\nthe consequences of Donath's plea waiver, noting that although\n\nDonath ordinarily would have the right to appeal,\n\n            you're agreeing here not to take any appeal of your\n            guilty plea and conviction, and you're also\n            agreeing that you won't appeal your sentence as\n            long as it's not more than 120 months or ten years.\n            In other words, if I sentence you at 120 months or\n            less, I'm the last judge in your case and you're\n            agreeing that you'll not be able to overturn what I\n            do.\n\nWhen the court asked Donath if he understood the waiver, Donath\n\nresponded that he did. After further colloquy on other issues, the\n\ncourt accepted Donath's guilty plea.\n\n            Donath appeared for sentencing on September 8, 2009.              At\n\nthe outset of the proceedings, the district court noted that the\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsole disputed issue was the presentence report's (\"PSR\") assignment\n\nof three criminal-history points to Donath, which precluded his\n\neligibility for safety-valve relief.          See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1).\n\nDonath's objection to the PSR focused on its assignment of two\n\ncriminal-history    points    for    misdemeanor       \"Criminal      Mischief\"\n\nconvictions in December 1998 and April 2001.2            The first of these\n\nconvictions   was   for   breaking   a     window.     The   second    was   for\n\n\"recklessly damag[ing] and destroy[ing] tires and property.\"                 In\n\nboth cases, Donath represented himself in Maine district court; the\n\nstate court assessed him a $150 fine for the first conviction and\n\na $150 fine and $365 in restitution for the second.\n\n          Donath argued that these convictions were minor offenses,\n\nwhich, under section 4A1.2(c)(1) of the guidelines, should not\n\nyield criminal-history points.        Although misdemeanor convictions\n\nare generally counted in defendants' criminal histories, section\n\n4A1.2(c) provides an exception when (1) the sentence for the past\n\nconviction was less than one year's probation or thirty days'\n\nimprisonment and (2) the past offense is one of or is \"similar to\"\n\ncertain offenses listed in the guideline.            U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1);\n\nsee also United States v. Matos, No. 09-1178, 2010 WL 2674483, at\n\n\n\n     2\n          Because the PSR's assignment of a third criminal-history\npoint for a 2009 Maine conviction for \"Obstruction of Government\nAdministration\" would not affect Donath's eligibility for safety-\nvalve relief if both the criminal mischief convictions were\ncounted, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1), the district court found \"it\nunnecessary to resolve that issue.\"\n\n                                     -6-\n\f*7 (1st Cir. July 7, 2010).             Donath claimed that his criminal\n\nmischief   convictions       were    similar     to    the     listed    offense     of\n\n\"disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace.\"\n\n           The district court rejected Donath's argument that he\n\nshould   not    receive      criminal-history         points    for     these    prior\n\nconvictions.     The district court considered United States v. May,\n\n343 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), which compared criminal mischief and\n\ndisorderly     conduct    under     Maine     law   and    held   that     statutory\n\ndifferences,    as    well    as    May's   offense       conduct,      rendered   the\n\noffenses dissimilar for purposes of section 4A1.2(c)(1).                        Id. at\n\n10. The district court explained that May's analysis of Maine law,\n\nas well as \"the underlying conduct here\"--particularly the fact\n\nthat Donath, like May, had destroyed his victims' property--\n\ndistinguished Donath's criminal mischief offenses from disorderly\n\nconduct.\n\n           Accordingly, the court found that Donath was ineligible\n\nfor safety-valve relief.           The ten-year mandatory minimum made his\n\nguidelines range 120 to 121 months' imprisonment. Had the criminal\n\nmischief misdemeanors not been counted toward his criminal-history\n\npoints and the safety valve been applied, the bottom of Donath's\n\nguideline sentencing range would have been considerably lower.\n\n           As it had agreed, the government recommended a sentence\n\nreduction based on Donath's acceptance of responsibility.                           The\n\ngovernment     also    cited       Donath's    extensive        cooperation        with\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fauthorities     as   a   basis   for   downward   departure,    see    U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5K1.1, for a total recommended reduction of 24 months.              The court\n\naccepted the government's recommendation but granted a larger, 30-\n\nmonth departure from Donath's minimum guidelines sentence and\n\nsentenced him to concurrent 90-month sentences on each of the three\n\ncounts of conviction.       At no time did Donath seek to withdraw his\n\nplea in the district court.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Donath makes two related arguments on appeal: that his\n\nappeals waiver should not be enforced and that, reaching the\n\nunderlying issue if his waiver is set aside, the district court\n\nerred by assigning him criminal-history points for his criminal\n\nmischief convictions.       We find Donath's waiver enforceable and do\n\nnot reach the merits of his second claim.\n\n            Our assessment of enforceability of a waiver of criminal\n\nappeal generally involves \"a step-by-step determination of the\n\nnature   and    circumstances     of   the   waiver\"   to   ensure    \"that   the\n\ndefendant's entry into the waiver was knowing and voluntary; that\n\nthe sentencing court adequately explained its import; that the\n\nputative appeal came within the scope of the waiver; and that\n\nenforcement of the waiver . . . would not work a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"      United States v. Calderón-Pacheco, 564 F.3d 55, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (citing United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 23-24 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fCir. 2001)); see also United States v. Cardona-Díaz, 524 F.3d 20,\n\n22 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Donath does not take issue with the first three factors.\n\nDonath knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to this appeal,\n\nthe district court adequately explained the consequences of his\n\nwaiver, and this putative appeal falls within the scope of the\n\nwaiver.      His    claim    instead   turns   on    his   argument    that   the\n\nsentencing court \"felt unnecessarily bound\" by May and that, under\n\nthese circumstances, enforcing the plea agreement would constitute\n\na miscarriage of justice.          This argument is meritless.\n\n            The     miscarriage-of-justice          exception     is   \"applied\n\nsparingly    and    without    undue   generosity\"     and   is   reserved    for\n\n\"egregious cases.\"          Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25-26; see also United\n\nStates v. Pratt, 533 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2008); Cardona-Díaz, 524\n\nF.3d at 22.       That Donath may have a different reading of the May\n\ndecision than the district court's straightforward analysis of the\n\ncase and its bearing on Donath's past offenses is not even arguably\n\nwithin     the    category    of   miscarriage-of-justice         claims.      We\n\ndiscourage such attempts to turn garden-variety disputes into\n\nmiscarriage-of-justice claims.          That ends the matter; however, we\n\nmake an additional point that appeals such as this should not be\n\nbrought.\n\n            When enforcing the appellate waiver, we stress that both\n\nsides are obligated to live by the bargain they made.                       Donath\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fentered his plea and waived his right to appeal knowing that his\n\neligibility for safety-valve relief remained uncertain.               His plea\n\nagreement did not reserve the ability to appeal the issue of his\n\neligibility for the safety-valve determination.            Had Donath wanted\n\nto condition his plea on safety-valve eligibility, he could have\n\nbargained for that right.         Cf. United States v. Santiago, 229 F.3d\n\n313, 315 (1st Cir. 2000).         If he wanted to first know how his PSR\n\nwould treat his past convictions, he could have requested that the\n\nPSR be prepared before he signed the plea agreement.                Cf. United\n\nStates v. Maldonado, No. 09-1626, 2010 WL 2898250, at *1 (1st Cir.\n\nJuly 26, 2010).       Donath chose to do neither.\n\n          Here, the government more than satisfied its end of the\n\nagreement.       As    pledged,    the    government    both   recommended   a\n\nsubstantial reduction in Donath's sentence for his acceptance of\n\nresponsibility and notified the court that Donath had cooperated\n\nwith authorities.       Moreover, although it had not agreed to do so,\n\nthe government urged the court to reduce Donath's sentence for his\n\ncooperation.       The    district      court   accepted   the   government's\n\nrecommendation    and    granted    a    yet-larger    sentencing   departure.\n\nDonath has received the benefit of his bargain.\n\n                                        III.\n\n          For these reasons, defendant's appeal is dismissed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

The indictment\n\ncharged     Donath    in    three      counts,   alleging    (1)    conspiracy      to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or\n\nmore   of   cocaine,       50    grams   or   more   of   cocaine    base,    and   an\n\nunspecified quantity of oxycodone; (2) conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and\n\n5 grams or more of cocaine base; and (3) a separate conspiracy\n\nto distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fmore of cocaine and 5 grams or more of cocaine base; all in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.\n\n            Two months later, in early November 2008, Donath reached\n\nan agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to all counts\n\nagainst him. Donath's written plea agreement described the charges\n\nand   the   penalties     he   faced.     As   detailed    in   the   agreement,\n\nconviction on Count 1 carried a mandatory minimum of ten years'\n\nimprisonment with a maximum sentence of life in prison; conviction\n\non Counts 2 and 3 meant a mandatory                minimum of five years'\n\nimprisonment with a maximum sentence of forty years in prison. The\n\nagreement also specified fines, special assessments, and supervised\n\nrelease terms associated with the charges.\n\n            In    exchange     for   Donath's    guilty    plea   and   further\n\ncooperation, the government agreed to recommend that the court give\n\nDonath a three-level offense-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. section 3E1.1.\n\n            The   plea    agreement     included   an     explicit    waiver   of\n\nDonath's right to appeal his plea or sentence, which read, in\n\nrelevant part,\n\n            Appeal Waivers. Defendant is aware that Title 18,\n            United States Code, Section 3742 affords a\n            defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed.\n            Knowing that, Defendant waives the right to appeal\n            the following:\n\n                     A.      Defendant's guilty plea and any other\n                             aspect of Defendant's conviction in the\n                             above-captioned case; and\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                      B.     A sentence of imprisonment that does\n                             not exceed 120 months.\n            . . . .\n\n                   The number of months mentioned in this\n            paragraph does not necessarily constitute an\n            estimate of the sentence that the parties expect\n            will be imposed.\n\nThe agreement was not conditioned on, and in fact did not mention,\n\nthe issue of Donath's eligibility for 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)'s \"safety\n\nvalve\"    adjustment.         Under   that     provision,   a   court   may     give\n\ndefendants who meet certain conditions, among them that they \"not\n\nhave more than 1 criminal history point,\" a reduction from an\n\notherwise mandatory minimum sentence.1              Id. § 3553(f)(1).\n\n            Donath signed the agreement on November 5, 2008, as did\n\nhis   counsel,    who      affirmed   that,    to   his   knowledge,    \"Donath's\n\ndecision   to    enter     into   this   Agreement    [wa]s     an   informed    and\n\nvoluntary one.\"\n\n            As part of this agreement, which was put on the public\n\ndocket, Donath also signed a supplemental agreement, which provided\n\nhim with letter immunity in exchange for his \"full and truthful\n\ncooperation.\"      This agreement was put under seal, presumably to\n\nprotect Donath.     The supplemental agreement expressly incorporated\n\n\n\n      1\n          The \"other conditions are that the defendant not use\nviolence or possess a weapon, that the offense not result in death\nor serious injury, that the defendant not organize the offense or\nengage in a continuing criminal enterprise, and that the defendant\ncooperate with the government.\" United States v.

July 26, 2010)\n(citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(2)-(5)).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe terms of the publicly filed agreement.            The government further\n\nagreed to \"make known [Donath's] cooperation\" upon Donath's request\n\nbut   did   not   commit   the   government   to     seeking   a   safety-valve\n\nreduction.        Donath thus knew that if the court at sentencing\n\nassigned him more than one criminal-history point he would be\n\nineligible for safety-valve relief. He also knew that there was no\n\nagreement on this and that he had waived his right to appeal any\n\nsentence the court would impose of 120 months or fewer.\n\n            On February 25, 2009, Donath pled guilty in the district\n\ncourt.      During   Donath's    plea    colloquy,    he   confirmed   that   he\n\nunderstood the terms and conditions of his plea agreement and that\n\nthe agreement was not binding on the court as to sentencing\n\nguidelines calculations.         The district court explicitly detailed\n\nthe consequences of Donath's plea waiver, noting that although\n\nDonath ordinarily would have the right to appeal,\n\n            you're agreeing here not to take any appeal of your\n            guilty plea and conviction, and you're also\n            agreeing that you won't appeal your sentence as\n            long as it's not more than 120 months or ten years.\n            In other words, if I sentence you at 120 months or\n            less, I'm the last judge in your case and you're\n            agreeing that you'll not be able to overturn what I\n            do.\n\nWhen the court asked Donath if he understood the waiver, Donath\n\nresponded that he did. After further colloquy on other issues, the\n\ncourt accepted Donath's guilty plea.\n\n            Donath appeared for sentencing on September 8, 2009.              At\n\nthe outset of the proceedings, the district court noted that the\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsole disputed issue was the presentence report's (\"PSR\") assignment\n\nof three criminal-history points to Donath, which precluded his\n\neligibility for safety-valve relief.          See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1).\n\nDonath's objection to the PSR focused on its assignment of two\n\ncriminal-history    points    for    misdemeanor       \"Criminal      Mischief\"\n\nconvictions in December 1998 and April 2001.2            The first of these\n\nconvictions   was   for   breaking   a     window.     The   second    was   for\n\n\"recklessly damag[ing] and destroy[ing] tires and property.\"                 In\n\nboth cases, Donath represented himself in Maine district court; the\n\nstate court assessed him a $150 fine for the first conviction and\n\na $150 fine and $365 in restitution for the second.\n\n          Donath argued that these convictions were minor offenses,\n\nwhich, under section 4A1.2(c)(1) of the guidelines, should not\n\nyield criminal-history points.        Although misdemeanor convictions\n\nare generally counted in defendants' criminal histories, section\n\n4A1.2(c) provides an exception when (1) the sentence for the past\n\nconviction was less than one year's probation or thirty days'\n\nimprisonment and (2) the past offense is one of or is \"similar to\"\n\ncertain offenses listed in the guideline.            U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1);\n\nsee also United States v. Matos, No. 09-1178, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2674483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n\n\n     2\n          Because the PSR's assignment of a third criminal-history\npoint for a 2009 Maine conviction for \"Obstruction of Government\nAdministration\" would not affect Donath's eligibility for safety-\nvalve relief if both the criminal mischief convictions were\ncounted, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1), the district court found \"it\nunnecessary to resolve that issue.\"\n\n                                     -6-\n\f*7 (1st Cir.

Donath claimed that his criminal\n\nmischief   convictions       were    similar     to    the     listed    offense     of\n\n\"disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace.\"\n\n           The district court rejected Donath's argument that he\n\nshould   not    receive      criminal-history         points    for     these    prior\n\nconvictions.     The district court considered United States v. May,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200626\"><a href=\"/opinion/200626/united-states-v-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2003), which compared criminal mischief and\n\ndisorderly     conduct    under     Maine     law   and    held   that     statutory\n\ndifferences,    as    well    as    May's   offense       conduct,      rendered   the\n\noffenses dissimilar for purposes of section 4A1.2(c)(1).                        Id. at\n\n10. The district court explained that May's analysis of Maine law,\n\nas well as \"the underlying conduct here\"--particularly the fact\n\nthat Donath, like May, had destroyed his victims' property--\n\ndistinguished Donath's criminal mischief offenses from disorderly\n\nconduct.\n\n           Accordingly, the court found that Donath was ineligible\n\nfor safety-valve relief.           The ten-year mandatory minimum made his\n\nguidelines range 120 to 121 months' imprisonment. Had the criminal\n\nmischief misdemeanors not been counted toward his criminal-history\n\npoints and the safety valve been applied, the bottom of Donath's\n\nguideline sentencing range would have been considerably lower.\n\n           As it had agreed, the government recommended a sentence\n\nreduction based on Donath's acceptance of responsibility.                           The\n\ngovernment     also    cited       Donath's    extensive        cooperation        with\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fauthorities     as   a   basis   for   downward   departure,    see    U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5K1.1, for a total recommended reduction of 24 months.              The court\n\naccepted the government's recommendation but granted a larger, 30-\n\nmonth departure from Donath's minimum guidelines sentence and\n\nsentenced him to concurrent 90-month sentences on each of the three\n\ncounts of conviction.       At no time did Donath seek to withdraw his\n\nplea in the district court.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Donath makes two related arguments on appeal: that his\n\nappeals waiver should not be enforced and that, reaching the\n\nunderlying issue if his waiver is set aside, the district court\n\nerred by assigning him criminal-history points for his criminal\n\nmischief convictions.       We find Donath's waiver enforceable and do\n\nnot reach the merits of his second claim.\n\n            Our assessment of enforceability of a waiver of criminal\n\nappeal generally involves \"a step-by-step determination of the\n\nnature   and    circumstances     of   the   waiver\"   to   ensure    \"that   the\n\ndefendant's entry into the waiver was knowing and voluntary; that\n\nthe sentencing court adequately explained its import; that the\n\nputative appeal came within the scope of the waiver; and that\n\nenforcement of the waiver . . . would not work a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"      United States v.

That Donath may have a different reading of the May\n\ndecision than the district court's straightforward analysis of the\n\ncase and its bearing on Donath's past offenses is not even arguably\n\nwithin     the    category    of   miscarriage-of-justice         claims.      We\n\ndiscourage such attempts to turn garden-variety disputes into\n\nmiscarriage-of-justice claims.
