Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Monica J. Molnar with whom Peter H. Noone and Avery Dooley\nPost & Avery, LLP were on brief for appellant.\n     Brian E. Lewis with whom David J. Kerman and Jackson Lewis LLP\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 27, 2011\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.    Maria Lucia Tayag (\"Tayag\") was\n\nterminated by her employer, Lahey Clinic Hospital, Inc. (\"Lahey\"),\n\nwhile taking an unapproved seven-week leave to accompany her\n\nhusband, Rhomeo Tayag (\"Rhomeo\"), on a spiritual healing trip. The\n\ndistrict court denied her claims against Lahey on summary judgment,\n\nincluding one under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"),\n\n29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654 (2006), and she now seeks review.\n\n           The   pertinent   background    events   are   largely    not   in\n\ndispute. Rhomeo suffers from serious medical conditions, including\n\ngout, chronic liver and heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and\n\nkidney problems that led to a transplant in 2000.         Tayag has looked\n\nafter him: transporting him to medical appointments, helping him\n\nwith household activities, preparing his food, aiding him in moving\n\naround the house, providing medication, and giving psychological\n\ncomfort.\n\n           Tayag began working for Lahey as a health management\n\nclerk in 2002 and received positive performance reviews.            In 2003,\n\nshe became eligible for leave under Lahey's FMLA policy, and until\n\nJuly 2006 Lahey consistently approved her requests for leave, which\n\ntypically lasted one or two days.         In May 2006, without claiming\n\nFMLA leave, Tayag used vacation time to travel with Rhomeo to\n\nLourdes, France--a major site for Roman Catholic pilgrimage and\n\nreputed miraculous healings.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            In June 2006, Tayag submitted a vacation request form for\n\nAugust 7 to September 22, 2006; her supervisor said this would\n\nleave the department with inadequate coverage but, as Tayag had\n\nindicated that her husband would be needing medical care, her\n\nsupervisor provided the paperwork for an FMLA leave request.                       On\n\nJuly 8, Tayag requested FMLA leave to assist Rhomeo while he\n\ntraveled, but did not inform Lahey that the travel was for a\n\nspiritual pilgrimage to the Philippines. Nor did she provide Lahey\n\nwith any contact information to reach her during the trip.\n\n            On   July   11,   2006,     Rhomeo     underwent     an     angioplasty\n\nprocedure.       That   month,    Tayag    spoke    to   Susan    Olsen--Lahey's\n\nbenefits administrator--about the FMLA request, and Olsen requested\n\nnew FMLA certification from Rhomeo's doctor.                    In early August,\n\nTayag gave Olsen a note and then a certification from Rhomeo's\n\nprimary care physician, Stephen Dong; the note stated that Rhomeo's\n\nliver,   kidney,    and   heart       diseases    \"significantly        affect    his\n\nfunctional capacity to do activities of daily living\" and advised\n\nthat Tayag receive medical leave \"to accompany Mr. Tayag on any\n\ntrips as he needs physical assistance on a regular basis.\"\n\n            Tayag also provided Olsen with the fax number of her\n\nhusband's    cardiologist        so    Lahey     could   send     the    doctor     a\n\ncertification form for completion.             The cardiologist returned the\n\nform on August 8, 2006, stating that Rhomeo was \"presently . . .\n\nnot incapacitated\" and that Tayag would not need leave.                      Olsen\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmailed Tayag letters on August 10 and 14 notifying her that the\n\nleave was unapproved, and Lahey representatives left phone messages\n\nat Tayag's home on August 8 and 17.           Tayag did not receive any of\n\nthese messages because she was in the Philippines from August 7 to\n\nSeptember 22.     Receiving no response, Lahey then sent a letter,\n\ndated August 18, terminating her employment.\n\n           In the Philippines, during August and early September\n\n2006, the Tayags went to Mass, prayed, and spoke with the priest\n\nand other pilgrims at the Pilgrimage of Healing Ministry at St.\n\nBartholomew's Parish.      From September 8 to 22, the Tayags visited\n\nother churches and friends and family.           While in the Philippines,\n\nRhomeo received no conventional medical treatment and saw no\n\ndoctors   or    health   care    providers.       Tayag   assisted   him   by\n\nadministering medications, helping him walk, carrying his luggage,\n\nand being present in case his illnesses incapacitated him.\n\n           On   April    30,    2008,   Tayag   filed   suit   against   Lahey\n\nalleging a number of claims,1 one being that her termination\n\nviolated the FMLA; only the FMLA claims are the subject of this\n\nappeal.   After discovery, Lahey moved for summary judgment on all\n\nclaims; Tayag moved for partial summary judgment on the FMLA\n\nclaims.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nLahey on all claims, determining as to the FMLA claims that the\n\n\n     1\n      Tayag also alleged violations of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2006), Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, id. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17, and state law.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fTayags' trip was not \"protected\" under the statute because it was\n\neffectively a vacation.       Tayag v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc., 677 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 446, 452 (D. Mass. 2010).            This appeal followed.\n\n             Orders granting summary judgment are reviewed de novo.\n\nEstate of Hevia v. Portrio Corp., 602 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nHere, the issues turn on the interpretation of the FMLA.                   Tayag\n\nmakes      two   claims--interference       with    substantive   rights     and\n\nretaliation for the exercise of those rights--that both hinge upon\n\nwhether the FMLA protects the type of trip taken by the Tayags.\n\nSee   29    U.S.C.   §   2615(a);   Colburn    v.   Parker   Hannifin/Nichols\n\nPortland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 331-32 (1st Cir. 2005); Hodgens v.\n\nGen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 159-61 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             The FMLA entitles employees to twelve workweeks annually\n\n\"to care for the spouse . . . of the employee, if such spouse . . .\n\nhas a serious health condition.\"         29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C).         The\n\nleave \"may be taken intermittently . . . when medically necessary,\"\n\nid. § 2612(b)(1), and if the leave \"is foreseeable based on planned\n\nmedical treatment,\" the employee must make a reasonable effort to\n\nschedule the treatment so that it does not unduly disrupt the\n\nemployer and must provide the employer with thirty days' notice\n\nunless impracticable, id. § 2612(e)(2).\n\n                 Tayag describes the travel as a series of \"healing\n\npilgrimages\" with incidental socializing.             This comports with her\n\ndeposition, the district court made no finding directly to the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcontrary, and we will accept her characterization.                      Tayag properly\n\ndoes       not    claim     that   caring     for    her   husband    would    itself   be\n\nprotected leave under the FMLA if the seven-week trip was for\n\nreasons unrelated to medical treatment of Rhomeo's illnesses.2 So,\n\nif the focus is on substantive protection, the result depends on\n\nwhether a \"healing pilgrimage\" comprises medical care within the\n\nmeaning of the FMLA.\n\n                  Under the statute and associated regulations, the answer\n\nis no.       The statute defines \"health care provider\" as \"a doctor of\n\nmedicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or\n\nsurgery          (as    appropriate)     by    the    State   in     which    the   doctor\n\npractices; or . . . any other person determined by the Secretary to\n\nbe capable of providing health care services.\"                               29 U.S.C. §\n\n2611(6).          Similarly, a \"serious health condition\" is \"an illness,\n\ninjury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves\n\n. . . inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical\n\ncare facility; or . . . continuing treatment by a health care\n\nprovider.\"             Id. § 2611(11).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      See Tellis v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., 414 F.3d 1045, 1048 (9th\nCir. 2005); Marchisheck v. San Mateo Cnty., 199 F.3d 1068, 1076\n(9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1214 (2000). The inclusion\nof \"psychological comfort and reassurance,\" 29 C.F.R. § 825.116, in\nthe definition of care cannot extend to accompaniment of an ill\nspouse on lengthy trips unrelated to medical care. (All citations\nto the Code of Federal Regulations are to the July 1, 2006,\nrevision operative at the time of Tayag's FMLA leave request.)\n\n                                              -6-\n\f           Faith healing is addressed solely in the regulation\n\nidentifying others \"capable of providing health care services,\"\n\nwhich includes \"Christian Science practitioners\" subject to certain\n\nconditions.     29 C.F.R. § 825.118.        Christian Scientists reject\n\nordinary medical care as defined by the statute and so, as to a\n\nChristian Scientist patient, there is no duplication either for\n\ngovernment insurance programs or for employers providing FMLA\n\nleave.    Tayag's husband gets ordinary medical care, and she has\n\ntaken full advantage of the FMLA to provide assistance to him in\n\nconnection with that care.\n\n           Further, Tayag does not invoke the Christian Science\n\nexception to cover her situation--her husband is not a Christian\n\nScientist--but as the basis for a constitutional argument.              Thus\n\nshe   asserts   summarily   that,   given   the   exception   granted   for\n\nChristian Science practitioners,\n\n           it would be an unconstitutional distinction\n           between religions to state that a Catholic\n           priest is not covered.     Both religiously\n           affiliated healing programs are aimed at\n           treating    the    illness  and   providing\n           psychological comfort.\n\nThis is hardly a serious treatment of a complex issue and is not\n\nadequate to preserve the claim on appeal.          See United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082\n\n(1990).   Even if the argument had been preserved, it would not be\n\nlikely to prevail in any form that assisted Tayag.\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             Thus, when Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Inc. v.\n\nVladeck,     938   F.   Supp.   1466   (D.   Minn.    1996),   struck   down   a\n\ncounterpart Christian Scientist exception relating to Medicare and\n\nMedicaid, id. at 1486, Congress adopted a new provision extending\n\nthe benefits of protection to care from \"religious nonmedical\n\nhealth care institutions\" of \"patients who choose to rely solely\n\nupon a religious method of healing and for whom the acceptance of\n\nmedical health services would be inconsistent with their religious\n\nbeliefs,\"    42    U.S.C.   §   1395x(ss)(1).        The   courts   upheld   this\n\nsolution.3\n\n             Even if a court felt free to impose such an extension\n\nwithout legislation, it would do Tayag no good: she does not claim\n\nthat Rhomeo's religion forbids ordinary medical care, and she has\n\nalready taken FMLA leave a number of times to assist him in\n\nconnection with receiving such care.            And it is hard to see how\n\nmore would be required: distinguishing among religions as such may\n\nwell be suspect; limiting FMLA coverage for faith healing trips to\n\nthose whose faith makes no other demands for medical assistance is\n\nnot self-evidently an improper discrimination.              See note 3, above.\n\n             Tayag's claim of entitlement to FMLA leave also falls on\n\nan independent ground.          Lahey required certification by a health\n\ncare provider for FMLA leave, which is permitted.                     29 U.S.C.\n\n\n     3\n      E.g., Kong v. Scully, 341 F.3d 1132, 1133-34 (9th Cir. 2003);\nChildren's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Inc., v. Min De Parle, 212\nF.3d 1084, 1088 (8th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 957 (2001).\n\n                                       -8-\n\f§ 2613.       For intermittent leave, the certification must include\n\namong       other    information     \"a    statement     that     the   employee's\n\nintermittent leave . . . is necessary for the care of the . . .\n\nspouse who has a serious health condition, or will assist in their\n\nrecovery,      and    the    expected     duration      and     schedule    of     the\n\nintermittent leave.\"           Id. § 2613(b)(1)-(4)(A), (7).\n\n              Intermittent leave periods may be of any length (less\n\nthan the twelve-week total allotment), 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(a), (d),\n\nbut the requested seven-week leave was different from the brief\n\nleaves taken by Tayag over the previous four years and suggested by\n\nearlier certifications.           When Dr. Dong provided a new certificate\n\nin August 2006, he included \"coronary artery disease\" for the first\n\ntime as a listed condition, but said only that Rhomeo's incapacity\n\nwould occur \"intermittently\" and for his \"lifetime\" and provided no\n\nexplanation as to why a seven-week leave would be needed.                          The\n\nomissions      gave    Lahey    \"reason    to   doubt    the    validity    of     the\n\ncertification,\"        29   U.S.C.   §    2613(c)(1),     permitting       Lahey    to\n\ndesignate another health care provider for a second opinion, id.4\n\n\n\n        4\n      Tayag argues that the second opinion was invalid because\n\"[t]here is no justification . . . supporting Lahey's assertion\nthat it had a right to insist on a certification from a particular\ndoctor.\" However, the statute states that the second health care\nprovider will be \"designated or approved by the employer,\"\n29 U.S.C. § 2613(c)(1), saying only that the provider \"shall not be\nemployed on a regular basis by the employer,\" id. § 2613(c)(2). No\nother argument is made to us against the second certificate. Cf.\n29   C.F.R.    §   825.308(e)   (limiting   second    opinions   on\n\"recertifications\").\n\n                                          -9-\n\f           That certification, from Tayag's cardiologist, stated\n\nthat Rhomeo was \"not incapacitated\" and Tayag did not require\n\nleave, although her presence could \"possibly\" provide psychological\n\ncomfort.   Since nothing in Dr. Dong's certificate provided a basis\n\nfor a seven-week leave and the cardiologist had disavowed the need\n\nfor any leave, Lahey was justified in denying FMLA leave.     See,\n\ne.g., Stoops v. One Call Commc'ns, Inc., 141 F.3d 309, 314 (7th\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n           Even assuming dubitante that Dr. Dong's certification\n\nadequately supports the leave, the statutory procedure in the event\n\nof a conflict between certifying doctors would require joint\n\nagreement on a third health care provider to give a binding final\n\nopinion.   29 U.S.C. § 2613(d).    At most Tayag might have been\n\nentitled to a third opinion and \"a reasonable opportunity to cure\n\nany . . . deficiency\" in certification raised by Lahey, 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 825.305(d), but Tayag's departure and failure to provide contact\n\ninformation blocked such processes.\n\n           In sum, Tayag's seven-week absence was not protected\n\nleave under the FMLA.   Tayag's second claim--retaliation--is both\n\nunderdeveloped and confusingly framed; she says that the discharge\n\nwas retaliation for requesting and taking leave. Insofar as she is\n\nasserting that she was discharged for taking leave, the claim fails\n\nbecause her leave was not protected.     See Orta-Castro v. Merck,\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fSharp & Dohme Química P.R., Inc., 447 F.3d 105, 113-14 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n            Requesting leave is also an FMLA-protected right, see\n\n29 C.F.R. § 825.220(a)(1), for which retaliation conceivably could\n\nbe wrongful even where the leave itself was unprotected, see\n\nColburn, 429 F.3d at 336 n.10.           But the discharge here was\n\nexpressly   for   taking   improper   leave--not   for   filing   a   leave\n\nrequest--and no rational jury could find that the asserted and\n\nadequate reason given was pretextual.        See Hodgens, 144 F.3d at\n\n166.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

(\"Lahey\"), while taking an unapproved seven-week leave to accompany her husband, Rhomeo Tayag (\"Rhomeo\"), on a spiritual healing trip. The district court denied her claims against Lahey on summary judgment, including two under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654 (2006), and she now seeks review.</p>\n<p>The pertinent background events are largely not in dispute. Rhomeo suffers from serious medical conditions, including gout, chronic liver and heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney problems that led to a transplant in 2000. Tayag has looked after him: transporting him to medical appointments, helping him with household activities, preparing his food, aiding him in moving around the house, providing medication, and giving psychological comfort.</p>\n<p>Tayag began working for Lahey as a health management clerk in 2002 and received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*790</span> positive performance reviews. In 2003, she became eligible for leave under Lahey's FMLA policy, and until July 2006 Lahey consistently approved her requests for leave, which typically lasted one or two days. In May 2006, without claiming FMLA leave, Tayag used vacation time to travel with Rhomeo to Lourdes, Francea major site for Roman Catholic pilgrimage and reputed miraculous healings.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, Tayag submitted a vacation request form for August 7 to September 22, 2006; her supervisor said this would leave the department with inadequate coverage but, as Tayag had indicated that her husband would be needing medical care, her supervisor provided the paperwork for an FMLA leave request. On July 8, Tayag requested FMLA leave to assist Rhomeo while he traveled, but did not inform Lahey that the travel was for a spiritual pilgrimage to the Philippines. Nor did she provide Lahey with any contact information to reach her during the trip.</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2006, Rhomeo underwent an angioplasty procedure. That month, Tayag spoke to Susan OlsenLahey's benefits administratorabout the FMLA request, and Olsen requested new FMLA certification from Rhomeo's doctor. In early August, Tayag gave Olsen a note and then a certification from Rhomeo's primary care physician, Stephen Dong; the note stated that Rhomeo's liver, kidney, and heart diseases \"significantly affect his functional capacity to do activities of daily living\" and advised that Tayag receive medical leave \"to accompany Mr. Tayag on any trips as he needs physical assistance on a regular basis.\"</p>\n<p>Tayag also provided Olsen with the fax number of her husband's cardiologist so Lahey could send the doctor a certification form for completion. The cardiologist returned the form on August 8, 2006, stating that Rhomeo was \"presently . . . not incapacitated\" and that Tayag would not need leave. Olsen mailed Tayag letters on August 10 and 14 notifying her that the leave was unapproved, and Lahey representatives left phone messages at Tayag's home on August 8 and 17. Tayag did not receive any of these messages because she was in the Philippines from August 7 to September 22. Receiving no response, Lahey then sent a letter, dated August 18, terminating her employment.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, during August and early September 2006, the Tayags went to Mass, prayed, and spoke with the priest and other pilgrims at the Pilgrimage of Healing Ministry at St. Bartholomew's Parish. From September 8 to 22, the Tayags visited other churches and friends and family. While in the Philippines, Rhomeo received no conventional medical treatment and saw no doctors or health care providers. Tayag assisted him by administering medications, helping him walk, carrying his luggage, and being present in case his illnesses incapacitated him.</p>\n<p>On April 30, 2008, Tayag filed suit against Lahey alleging a number of claims,<sup>[1]</sup> including that her termination violated the FMLA; only the FMLA claims are the subject of this appeal. After discovery, Lahey moved for summary judgment on all claims; Tayag moved for partial summary judgment on the FMLA claims. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Lahey on all claims, determining as to the FMLA claims that the Tayags' trip was not \"protected\" under the statute because it was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*791</span> effectively a vacation. <i>Tayag v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc.,</i> 677 F.Supp.2d 446, 452 (D.Mass.2010). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>Orders granting summary judgment are reviewed <i>de novo. </i><i>Estate of Hevia v. Portrio Corp.,</i> 602 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.2010). Here, the issues turn on the interpretation of the FMLA. Tayag makes two claimsinterference with substantive rights and retaliation for the exercise of those rightsthat both hinge upon whether the FMLA protects the type of trip taken by the Tayags. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a); <i>Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div.,</i> 429 F.3d 325, 331-32 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 159-61 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The FMLA entitles employees to twelve workweeks annually \"to care for the spouse . . . of the employee, if such spouse. . . has a serious health condition.\" 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). The leave \"may be taken intermittently . . . when medically necessary,\" <i>id.</i> § 2612(b)(1), and if the leave \"is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment,\" the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so that it does not unduly disrupt the employer and must provide the employer with thirty days' notice unless impracticable, <i>id.</i> § 2612(e)(2).</p>\n<p>Tayag describes the travel as a series of \"healing pilgrimages\" with incidental socializing. This comports with her deposition, the district court made no finding directly to the contrary, and we will accept her characterization. Tayag properly does not claim that caring for her husband would itself be protected leave under the FMLA if the seven-week trip was for reasons unrelated to medical treatment of Rhomeo's illnesses.<sup>[2]</sup> So, if the focus is on substantive protection, the result depends on whether a \"healing pilgrimage\" comprises medical care within the meaning of the FMLA.</p>\n<p>Under the statute and associated regulations, the answer is no. The statute defines \"health care provider\" as \"a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in which the doctor practices; or . . . any other person determined by the Secretary to be capable of providing health care services.\" 29 U.S.C. § 2611(6). Similarly, a \"serious health condition\" is \"an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves . . . inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or . . . continuing treatment by a health care provider.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2611(11).</p>\n<p>Faith healing is addressed solely in the regulation identifying others \"capable of providing health care services,\" which includes \"Christian Science practitioners\" subject to certain conditions. 29 C.F.R. § 825.118. Christian Scientists reject ordinary medical care as defined by the statute and so, as to a Christian Scientist patient, there is no duplication either for government insurance programs or for employers providing FMLA leave. Tayag's husband gets ordinary medical care, and she has taken full advantage of the FMLA to provide assistance to him in connection with that care.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*792</span> Further, Tayag does not invoke the Christian Science exception to cover her situationher husband is not a Christian Scientistbut as the basis for a constitutional argument. Thus she asserts summarily that, given the exception granted for Christian Science practitioners,</p>\n<blockquote>it would be an unconstitutional distinction between religions to state that a Catholic priest is not covered. Both religiously affiliated healing programs are aimed at treating the illness and providing psychological comfort.</blockquote>\n<p>This is hardly a serious treatment of a complex issue and is not adequate to preserve the claim on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990). Even if the argument had been preserved, it would not be likely to prevail in any form that assisted Tayag.</p>\n<p>Thus, when <i>Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Inc. v. Vladeck,</i> 938 F.Supp. 1466 (D.Minn.1996), struck down a counterpart Christian Scientist exception relating to Medicare and Medicaid, <i>id.</i> at 1486, Congress adopted a new provision extending the benefits of protection to care from \"religious nonmedical health care institutions\" of \"patients who choose to rely solely upon a religious method of healing and for whom the acceptance of medical health services would be inconsistent with their religious beliefs,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(ss)(1). The courts upheld this solution.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if a court felt free to impose such an extension without legislation, it would do Tayag no good: she does not claim that Rhomeo's religion forbids ordinary medical care, and she has already taken FMLA leave a number of times to assist him in connection with receiving such care. And it is hard to see how more would be required: distinguishing among religions as such may well be suspect; limiting FMLA coverage for faith healing trips to those whose faith makes no other demands for medical assistance is not self-evidently an improper discrimination. <i>See</i> note 3, above.</p>\n<p>Tayag's claim of entitlement to FMLA leave also falls on an independent ground. Lahey required certification by a health care provider for FMLA leave, which is permitted. 29 U.S.C. § 2613. For intermittent leave, the certification must include among other information \"a statement that the employee's intermittent leave . . . is necessary for the care of the. . . spouse who has a serious health condition, or will assist in their recovery, and the expected duration and schedule of the intermittent leave.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2613(b)(1)-(4)(A), (7).</p>\n<p>Intermittent leave periods may be of any length (less than the twelve-week total allotment), 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(a), (d), but the requested seven-week leave was different from the brief leaves taken by Tayag over the previous four years and suggested by earlier certifications. When Dr. Dong provided a new certificate in August 2006, he included \"coronary artery disease\" for the first time as a listed condition, but said only that Rhomeo's incapacity would occur \"intermittently\" and for his \"lifetime\" and provided no explanation as to why a seven-week leave would be needed. The omissions gave Lahey \"reason to doubt the validity of the certification,\" 29 U.S.C. § 2613(c)(1), permitting Lahey to designate another health care provider for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*793</span> a second opinion, <i>id.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>That certification, from Tayag's cardiologist, stated that Rhomeo was \"not incapacitated\" and Tayag did not require leave, although her presence could \"possibly\" provide psychological comfort. Since nothing in Dr. Dong's certificate provided a basis for a seven-week leave and the cardiologist had disavowed the need for any leave, Lahey was justified in denying FMLA leave. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stoops v. One Call Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 141 F.3d 309, 314 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Even assuming <i>dubitante</i> that Dr. Dong's certification adequately supports the leave, the statutory procedure in the event of a conflict between certifying doctors would require joint agreement on a third health care provider to give a binding final opinion. 29 U.S.C. § 2613(d). At most Tayag might have been entitled to a third opinion and \"a reasonable opportunity to cure any . . . deficiency\" in certification raised by Lahey, 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(d), but Tayag's departure and failure to provide contact information blocked such processes.</p>\n<p>In sum, Tayag's seven-week absence was not protected leave under the FMLA. Tayag's second claimretaliationis both underdeveloped and confusingly framed; she says that the discharge was retaliation for requesting and taking leave. Insofar as she is asserting that she was discharged for taking leave, the claim fails because her leave was not protected. <i>See </i><i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Quimica P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 105, 113-14 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Requesting leave is also an FMLA-protected right, <i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(a)(1), for which retaliation conceivably could be wrongful even where the leave itself was unprotected, <i>see </i><i>Colburn,</i> 429 F.3d at 336 n. 10. But the discharge here was expressly for taking improper leavenot for filing a leave requestand no rational jury could find that the asserted and adequate reason given was pretextual. <i>See </i><i>Hodgens,</i> 144 F.3d at 166.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Tayag also alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2006), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <i>id.</i> §§ 2000e to 2000e-17, and state law.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See </i><i>Tellis v.

(\"Lahey\"), while taking an unapproved seven-week leave to accompany her husband, Rhomeo Tayag (\"Rhomeo\"), on a spiritual healing trip. The district court denied her claims against Lahey on summary judgment, including two under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654 (2006), and she now seeks review.</p>\n<p>The pertinent background events are largely not in dispute. Rhomeo suffers from serious medical conditions, including gout, chronic liver and heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney problems that led to a transplant in 2000. Tayag has looked after him: transporting him to medical appointments, helping him with household activities, preparing his food, aiding him in moving around the house, providing medication, and giving psychological comfort.</p>\n<p>Tayag began working for Lahey as a health management clerk in 2002 and received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*790</span> positive performance reviews. In 2003, she became eligible for leave under Lahey's FMLA policy, and until July 2006 Lahey consistently approved her requests for leave, which typically lasted one or two days. In May 2006, without claiming FMLA leave, Tayag used vacation time to travel with Rhomeo to Lourdes, Francea major site for Roman Catholic pilgrimage and reputed miraculous healings.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, Tayag submitted a vacation request form for August 7 to September 22, 2006; her supervisor said this would leave the department with inadequate coverage but, as Tayag had indicated that her husband would be needing medical care, her supervisor provided the paperwork for an FMLA leave request. On July 8, Tayag requested FMLA leave to assist Rhomeo while he traveled, but did not inform Lahey that the travel was for a spiritual pilgrimage to the Philippines. Nor did she provide Lahey with any contact information to reach her during the trip.</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2006, Rhomeo underwent an angioplasty procedure. That month, Tayag spoke to Susan OlsenLahey's benefits administratorabout the FMLA request, and Olsen requested new FMLA certification from Rhomeo's doctor. In early August, Tayag gave Olsen a note and then a certification from Rhomeo's primary care physician, Stephen Dong; the note stated that Rhomeo's liver, kidney, and heart diseases \"significantly affect his functional capacity to do activities of daily living\" and advised that Tayag receive medical leave \"to accompany Mr. Tayag on any trips as he needs physical assistance on a regular basis.\"</p>\n<p>Tayag also provided Olsen with the fax number of her husband's cardiologist so Lahey could send the doctor a certification form for completion.
