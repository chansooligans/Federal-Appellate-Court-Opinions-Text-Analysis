Some background\n\nfacts are necessary.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Plaintiff-appellee,  Melinda Ryan  Armacost, was  a\n\npedestrian in Newport, Rhode  Island, when she was  struck by\n\nan  automobile  owned and  operated  by  Stephen  B. Owen,  a\n\nresident  of  New  York.   Owen  was  insured  by  defendant-\n\nappellant,  Amica   Mutual  Insurance   Company  (Amica)   of\n\nProvidence,  Rhode Island.    A complaint  was  filed in  the\n\ndistrict court against Owen, but the summons was returned non\n                                                             \n\nest  inventus.   Plaintiff  promptly  amended her  complaint,\n             \n\nnaming  Amica as defendant under Rhode Island's direct action\n\nstatute.1   After  discovery  was  completed,  but  prior  to\n\ntrial, Amica admitted  negligence by its  insured.  The  only\n\nissue for trial, therefore, was the amount of damages.\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  statute,  R.I.  Gen.  Laws     27-7-2,  provides  in\npertinent part:\n             An injured party, or, in the  event of\n\n          that party's death, the party entitled to\n          sue therefor, in his or her suit  against\n          the insured, shall  not join the  insurer\n          as a defendant.  If, however, the officer\n          serving any  process against  the insured\n          shall  return   that  process   \"non  est\n          inventus,\"  . .  . the  party .  . .  may\n          proceed directly against the insurer.  \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Shortly  prior  to   the  trial  date,  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel made a  written demand \"equal to  the coverage limits\n\nof  $500,000\" to  settle the case.   The  demand specifically\n\nreferred to the statute at  issue, R.I. Gen. Laws   27-7-2.2.\n\nAmica  rejected  the  demand  and  made  a  counter offer  of\n\n$175,000.  This  was spurned by plaintiff.   During the trial\n\nAmica  again offered to  settle for  $175,000; the  offer was\n\nagain  rejected.   The jury  returned a verdict  of $750,000.\n\nThe district court amended the judgment by reducing it to the\n\namount  of Amica's contractual  liability under its  policy  \n\n$495,000.2   The  district  court then  held  that Amica  was\n\nrequired under  the  statute  to  pay  plaintiff  prejudgment\n\ninterest on the amended judgment, \"even though such interest,\n\nwhen added to the amended  judgment, requires Amica to pay an\n\namount which exceeds  the limits of  its liability under  the\n\napplicable  insurance policy.\"   Armacost v. Amica  Mut. Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 821 F. Supp. 75, 82 (D.R.I. 1993).\n   \n\n                             II.\n\n          The  statute at issue  has not been  interpreted by\n\nthe  Rhode Island  Supreme Court.    The only  court to  have\n\nconsidered it  is the  United  States District  Court in  the\n\nopinion from  which this appeal  has been taken.   This means\n\nthat  we are  called  upon  to decide  how  the Rhode  Island\n\n                    \n\n2.  The original policy  limits of $500,000 had  been reduced\nby $5,000 because of a payment  in that amount to settle  the\nclaim of plaintiff's husband.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nSupreme  Court would construe  the statute in  the context of\n\nthis case.   The standard  of review of the  district court's\n\nopinion is  de  novo.   We  do not  accord deference  to  the\n                    \n\ndistrict  court's determination of  Rhode Island law.   Salve\n                                                             \n\nRegina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 231-35 (1991).\n                         \n\n          The statute to be construed provides:\n\n             Interest  on  judgment     Payment  by\n          insurer.    In any civil  action in which\n          insurer.  \n          the  defendant  is covered  by  liability\n          insurance  and  in  which  the  plaintiff\n          makes a written offer  to the defendant's\n          insurer to settle the action in an amount\n          equal to or less than the coverage limits\n          on the  liability policy in force  at the\n          time the action accrues and the offer  is\n          rejected by the  defendant's insurer then\n          the defendant's  insurer shall  be liable\n          for all  interest  due  on  the  judgment\n          entered by  the court even if the payment\n          of  the  judgment  and  interest  thereon\n          totals  a sum  in  excess  of the  policy\n          coverage limitation.   This written offer\n          shall be presumed  to have been  rejected\n          if  the insurer does not respond within a\n          period of thirty (30) days.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws   27-7-2.2.\n\n          Rhode   Island's   prejudgment   interest   statute\n\nprovides:\n\n             Interest  in civil  action.    In  any\n             Interest  in civil  action.    \n          civil  action  in   which  a  verdict  is\n          rendered or a decision made for pecuniary\n          damages, there  shall  be  added  by  the\n          clerk  of  the  court to  the  amount  of\n          damages, interest at  the rate of  twelve\n          per cent (12%) per annum thereon from the\n          date  the cause  of action  accrued which\n          shall be included in the judgment entered\n          therein.   This section  shall not  apply\n          until  entry   of  judgment  or   to  any\n          contractual \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          obligation  where  interest   is  already\n          provided  or   as  to   any  condemnation\n          action.\n\nId.   9-21-10.\n   \n\n          The  question is  whether the  prejudgment interest\n\nstatute,   9-21-10, applies to the  rejected-settlement-offer\n\nstatute,   27-7-2.2.  Ordinarily, we would certify to a state\n\nsupreme  court a question  of first impression  involving the\n\ninterpretation of  a state statute.   In this  case, however,\n\nthe  language of the implicated statutes, the evident purpose\n\nof the statutes, and the case law are so clear that  we think\n\ncertification would be a waste of judicial resources.\n\n          Amica  raises two issues:  whether the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court would construe    27-7-2.2 as not applicable to\n\ndirect action suits  against insurers; and whether  the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court  would limit the  interest due on  cases\n\narising under   27-7-2.2 to that accruing after judgment.\n\nA.  The Applicability of   27-7-2.2 to the Direct Action\n                                                        \n    Statute\n           \n\n          Amica's  argument  on  the   first  issue  runs  as\n\nfollows.   The  starting  point  is  that  statutes  granting\n\ninterest  on judgment must be strictly construed because they\n\nare in derogation  of the common law.  So  construed,   27-7-\n\n2.2  applies  only  to actions  \"in  which  the defendant  is\n\ncovered by  liability insurance.\"   Amica therefore  contends\n\nthat, because it  is an insurer, and not, in the words of the\n\nstatute,  \"a defendant  covered by  liability insurance,\"  it\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ndoes not come  within the compass of the  statute.  It argues\n\nthat the phrase \"written offer to the defendant's insurer\" is\n\ndirected at the situation where the decision to settle is not\n\nwithin   the  control  of   the  defendant,  but   lies  with\n\ndefendant's  insurer.    The purpose  of  the  statute, Amica\n\nconcludes,  is to  protect a  defendant who  is  insured from\n\ninterest liability  in excess of  the policy limits due  to a\n\ndecision made by the insurer.\n\n          This is an  ingenious argument; it uses  the strict\n\nconstruction  doctrine  to  avoid the  plain  meaning  of the\n\nstatute.   But  it ignores  the  legal fact  that the  action\n\nagainst the  insurer is a  derivative action.  Amica  was the\n\ninsurer  of defendant  Owen.   The  complaint was  originally\n\nbrought against Owen.   Amica was made a  defendant under the\n\ndirect  action statute,    27-7-2, because its  insured could\n\nnot be  served with process.   Amica stands in  Owen's shoes.\n\nIt is both defendant and insurer.  This case  started out, in\n\nthe words  of    27-7-2.2, as  a \"civil action  in which  the\n\ndefendant is covered by liability insurance.\"  If process had\n\nbeen served on Owen, Amica's  handling of the case would have\n\nbeen no different,  and it would be making  the same argument\n\nas to  prejudgment interest because  in either case  it would\n\nhave to pay the amount found  due.  We see no basis  in logic\n\nor  common  sense for  the  argument that    27-7-2.2  is not\n\napplicable to the insurer under the direct action statute.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nB.  Construing the Statute\n                          \n\n          Amica  makes  a number  of arguments  attacking the\n\ndistrict  court's   construction   of  the   statute.     The\n\noverarching argument is that the district court did not apply\n\nthe  rules of  statutory construction  that  would have  been\n\napplied by the  Rhode Island Supreme Court and,  as a result,\n\nimproperly construed the statute.   Because our review is  de\n                                                             \n\nnovo without any  deference to the district court,  we do not\n    \n\nthink  it  necessary  to  discuss point-by-point  defendant's\n\nattack on the  district court opinion.  The  only question is\n\nwhether  the ultimate conclusion of the district court should\n\nbe affirmed.  We  are not concerned  with the route taken  by\n\nthe court in reaching its result.\n\n          We start our  analysis with a determination  of the\n\npurpose of the rejected-settlement-offer statute,   27-7-2.2.\n\nAlthough  the construction of  this statute  is one  of first\n\nimpression, the purpose of the prejudgment  interest statute,\n\n  9-21-10, has been  articulated by the Rhode  Island Supreme\n\nCourt.   In Martin  v. Lumberman's Mutual  Casualty, 559 A.2d\n                                                   \n\n1028 (R.I.  1989), the Rhode  Island Supreme Court  held that\n\nthe prejudgment interest did not apply to condemnation cases.\n\nIn the course of its opinion it stated:\n\n          Statutes that award  prejudgment interest\n          generally  serve  the  dual  purposes  of\n          encouraging  the   early  settlement   of\n          claims, Pray v.  Narragansett Improvement\n                                                   \n          Co., 434  A.2d 923, 930  (R.I. 1981), and\n             \n          compensating plaintiffs  for waiting  for\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          recompense  to  which they  were  legally\n          entitled,  Dennis v.  Rhode Island  Hosp.\n                                                   \n          Trust Nat'l Bank, 744 F.2d  893, 901 (1st\n                          \n          Cir. 1984).\n\nMartin, 559  A.2d at 1031;  see also Isserlis v.  Director of\n                                                             \n\nPublic Works, 300 A.2d 273, 274 (R.I. 1973) (clear purpose of\n            \n\nsuch legislation was to accelerate settlement of tort cases).\n\nWe have  echoed this finding  of settlement purpose.   Roy v.\n                                                          \n\nStar Chopper Co.,  584 F.2d 1124, 1135 (1st  Cir. 1978) (\"The\n                \n\nRhode Island prejudgment  statute was enacted to  promote the\n\nexpeditious settlement of claims.\").\n\n          We think it plain from its terms that the rejected-\n\nsettlement-offer  statute   has  the  same  purpose   as  the\n\nprejudgment interest statute    to accelerate the  settlement\n\nof tort  cases.   This purpose is  readily apparent  from its\n\nprovision that if the plaintiff's offer of settlement\n\n          is  rejected by  the defendant's  insurer\n          then  the  defendant's insurer  shall  be\n          liable  for  all  interest   due  on  the\n          judgment entered by the court even if the\n          payment  of  the  judgment  and  interest\n          thereon  totals a  sum  in excess  of the\n          policy coverage limitation.\n\n  27-7-2.2.\n\nThis language tells the insurer in no uncertain terms that it\n\nruns the  risk of paying a  stiff price for shrugging  off an\n\noffer of settlement.\n\n          We next turn  to the wording of the  two implicated\n\nstatutes.   The prejudgment interest  statute says:   \"In any\n                                                             \n\ncivil action in which a verdict is rendered or a  decision is\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nmade for pecuniary  damages,\" interest shall be added  to the\n\namount of damages from the  date the cause of action accrued.\n\n  9-21-10.   It is beyond  cavil that this  case was a  civil\n\naction,  that  plaintiff's  offer of  settlement  was  for an\n\namount \"equal to  . . . the coverage limits  in the liability\n\npolicy in  force at  the time the  action accrue[d],  and the\n\noffer  was rejected  by the  insurer.\"      27-7-2.2.   It is\n\nmanifest  that  the  prejudgment  interest  statute   applies\n\ndirectly to the case at bar.\n\n          It also  seems  evident to  us  that, by  its  very\n\nwords,     27-7-2.2  requires  the  payment  of   prejudgment\n\ninterest.  It says that  if the plaintiff's offer is rejected\n\n\"then  the  defendant's  insurer  shall  be  liable  for  all\n                                                             \n\ninterest due on the judgment entered by the court even if the\n\npayment of the judgment and  interest thereon totals a sum in\n\nexcess of the policy coverage limitation.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\nDespite the labored  argument of defendants to  the contrary,\n\nit   seems  obvious  that   \"all  interest\"  can   only  mean\n\nprejudgment  and postjudgment interest.  And this is the only\n\ninterpretation that makes sense if the purpose of the statute\n\nis to promote settlement, as is  obvious.  There would be  no\n\npressure on the insurer to consider a settlement offer if all\n\nit  had to  pay  for rejecting  the  offer was  post-judgment\n\ninterest.

Owen, a resident of New York.  Owen was insured by defendant-appellant, Amica Mutual Insurance Company (Amica) of Providence, Rhode Island.  A complaint was filed in the district court against Owen, but the summons was returned non est inventus.   Plaintiff promptly amended her complaint, naming Amica as defendant under Rhode Island's direct action statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After discovery was completed, but prior to trial, Amica admitted negligence by its insured.

The demand specifically referred to the statute at issue, R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 27-7-2.2.  Amica rejected the demand and made a counter offer of $175,000.  This was spurned by plaintiff.  During the trial Amica again offered to settle for $175,000;  the offer was again rejected.  The jury returned a verdict of $750,000.  The district court amended the judgment by reducing it to the amount of Amica's contractual liability under its policy--$495,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court then held that Amica was required under the statute to pay plaintiff prejudgment interest on the amended judgment, \"even though such interest, when added to the amended judgment, requires Amica to pay an amount which exceeds the limits of its liability under the applicable insurance policy.\"  Armacost v.

Ordinarily, we would certify to a state supreme court a question of first impression involving the interpretation of a state statute.  In this case, however, the language of the implicated statutes, the evident purpose of the statutes, and the case law are so clear that we think certification would be a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica raises two issues:  whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would construe Sec. 27-7-2.2 as not applicable to direct action suits against insurers;  and whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would limit the interest due on cases arising under Sec. 27-7-2.2 to that accruing after judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A. The Applicability of Sec. 27-7-2.2 to the Direct Action Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica's argument on the first issue runs as follows.  The starting point is that statutes granting interest on judgment must be strictly construed because they are in derogation of the common law.  So construed, Sec. 27-7-2.2 applies only to actions \"in which the defendant is covered by liability insurance.\"   Amica therefore contends that, because it is an insurer, and not, in the words of the statute, \"a defendant covered by liability insurance,\" it does not come within the compass of the statute.  It argues that the phrase \"written offer to the defendant's insurer\" is directed at the situation where the decision to settle is not within the control of the defendant, but lies with defendant's insurer.  The purpose of the statute, Amica concludes, is to protect a defendant who is insured from interest liability in excess of the policy limits due to a decision made by the insurer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an ingenious argument;  it uses the strict construction doctrine to avoid the plain meaning of the statute.  But it ignores the legal fact that the action against the insurer is a derivative action.  Amica was the insurer of defendant Owen.  The complaint was originally brought against Owen.  Amica was made a defendant under the direct action statute, Sec. 27-7-2, because its insured could not be served with process.  Amica stands in Owen's shoes.  It is both defendant and insurer.  This case started out, in the words of Sec. 27-7-2.2, as a \"civil action in which the defendant is covered by liability insurance.\"   If process had been served on Owen, Amica's handling of the case would have been no different, and it would be making the same argument as to prejudgment interest because in either case it would have to pay the amount found due.  We see no basis in logic or common sense for the argument that Sec. 27-7-2.2 is not applicable to the insurer under the direct action statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Construing the Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica makes a number of arguments attacking the district court's construction of the statute.  The overarching argument is that the district court did not apply the rules of statutory construction that would have been applied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court and, as a result, improperly construed the statute.  Because our review is de novo without any deference to the district court, we do not think it necessary to discuss point-by-point defendant's attack on the district court opinion.  The only question is whether the ultimate conclusion of the district court should be affirmed.  We are not concerned with the route taken by the court in reaching its result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis with a determination of the purpose of the rejected-settlement-offer statute, Sec. 27-7-2.2.  Although the construction of this statute is one of first impression, the purpose of the prejudgment interest statute, Sec. 9-21-10, has been articulated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.  In Martin v. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty, 559 A.2d 1028 (R.I.1989), the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that the prejudgment interest did not apply to condemnation cases.  In the course of its opinion it stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Statutes that award prejudgment interest generally serve the dual purposes of encouraging the early settlement of claims, Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 930 (R.I.1981), and compensating plaintiffs for waiting for recompense to which they were legally entitled, Dennis v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 744 F.2d 893, 901 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin, 559 A.2d at 1031;  see also Isserlis v. Director of Public Works, 111 R.I. 164, 300 A.2d 273, 274 (1973) (clear purpose of such legislation was to accelerate settlement of tort cases).  We have echoed this finding of settlement purpose.  Roy v. Star Chopper Co., 584 F.2d 1124, 1135 (1st Cir.1978) (\"The Rhode Island prejudgment statute was enacted to promote the expeditious settlement of claims.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it plain from its terms that the rejected-settlement-offer statute has the same purpose as the prejudgment interest statute--to accelerate the settlement of tort cases.  This purpose is readily apparent from its provision that if the plaintiff's offer of settlement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>is rejected by the defendant's insurer then the defendant's insurer shall be liable for all interest due on the judgment entered by the court even if the payment of the judgment and interest thereon totals a sum in excess of the policy coverage limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 27-7-2.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This language tells the insurer in no uncertain terms that it runs the risk of paying a stiff price for shrugging off an offer of settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the wording of the two implicated statutes.  The prejudgment interest statute says:  \"In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision is made for pecuniary damages,\" interest shall be added to the amount of damages from the date the cause of action accrued.  Sec.  9-21-10.  It is beyond cavil that this case was a civil action, that plaintiff's offer of settlement was for an amount \"equal to ... the coverage limits on the liability policy in force at the time the action accrue[d], and the offer was rejected by the insurer.\"   Section 27-7-2.2.  It is manifest that the prejudgment interest statute applies directly to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also seems evident to us that, by its very words, Sec. 27-7-2.2 requires the payment of prejudgment interest.  It says that if the plaintiff's offer is rejected \"then the defendant's insurer shall be liable for all interest due on the judgment entered by the court even if the payment of the judgment and interest thereon totals a sum in excess of the policy coverage limitation.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Despite the labored argument of defendants to the contrary, it seems obvious that \"all interest\" can only mean prejudgment and postjudgment interest.  And this is the only interpretation that makes sense if the purpose of the statute is to promote settlement, as is obvious.  There would be no pressure on the insurer to consider a settlement offer if all it had to pay for rejecting the offer was post-judgment interest.  Defendant's suggested construction of the statute would take all of the bite out of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the following statement by the Rhode Island Supreme Court applies to the statute in issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of a statute so clear and unambiguous there is no room for the application of the usual canons of statutory construction.  In such a case the statute declares itself.  Vezina v. Bodreau, 86 R.I. 87, 133 A.2d 753;  Long v. Langlois, 93 R.I. 23, 170 A.2d 618.   We may not where no ambiguity exists search beyond the statute for a different meaning.  Hathaway v. Hathaway, 52 R.I. 39, 156 A. 800.   Even hardship does not justify a court in reading into a statute something contrary to its unequivocal language.  Clark v. Orabona, 1st Cir., 59 F.2d 187.   Only when the legislature sounds an uncertain trumpet may the court move in to clarify the call.  But when the call is clear and certain as it is here we may not consider whether the statute as written comports with our ideas of justice, expediency or sound public policy.  In such circumstances that is not the court's business.  Blais v. Franklin, 31 R.I. 95, 77 A. 172.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kastal v. Hickory House, Inc., 95 R.I. 366, 187 A.2d 262, 264-65 (R.I.1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Out of an abundance of caution we have examined similar statutes in other jurisdictions because we think the Rhode Island Supreme Court might possibly have done so.  Of the more than thirty states surveyed, many have prejudgment interest statutes accompanied by rejected-settlement-offer provisions, or separate statutes that are invoked in tandem to expedite claims settlement.  See, e.g., Cal.Civ.Code Sec. 3291 (West Supp.1993);  Conn.Gen.Stat. Sec. 52-192a(b);  Minn.Stat.Ann. Sec. 549.09, subd. 1(b) (West Supp.1993);  Mo.Ann.Stat. Sec. 408.040.2 (Vernon 1990);  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. Sec. 1343.03(C) (Anderson Supp.1993).  Our survey has not disclosed a single instance where prejudgment interest has been held not to apply to a rejected-settlement-offer statute.  Given the rejected-settlement-offer statute's plain language and the Rhode Island courts' long history of applying the prejudgment interest statute in tort cases, we think the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply its prejudgment interest statute to the rejected-settlement-offer statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

The demand specifically referred to the statute at issue, R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 27-7-2.2.  Amica rejected the demand and made a counter offer of $175,000.  This was spurned by plaintiff.  During the trial Amica again offered to settle for $175,000;  the offer was again rejected.  The jury returned a verdict of $750,000.  The district court amended the judgment by reducing it to the amount of Amica's contractual liability under its policy--$495,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court then held that Amica was required under the statute to pay plaintiff prejudgment interest on the amended judgment, \"even though such interest, when added to the amended judgment, requires Amica to pay an amount which exceeds the limits of its liability under the applicable insurance policy.\"  Armacost v.

Ordinarily, we would certify to a state supreme court a question of first impression involving the interpretation of a state statute.  In this case, however, the language of the implicated statutes, the evident purpose of the statutes, and the case law are so clear that we think certification would be a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica raises two issues:  whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would construe Sec. 27-7-2.2 as not applicable to direct action suits against insurers;  and whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court would limit the interest due on cases arising under Sec. 27-7-2.2 to that accruing after judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A. The Applicability of Sec. 27-7-2.2 to the Direct Action Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica's argument on the first issue runs as follows.  The starting point is that statutes granting interest on judgment must be strictly construed because they are in derogation of the common law.  So construed, Sec. 27-7-2.2 applies only to actions \"in which the defendant is covered by liability insurance.\"   Amica therefore contends that, because it is an insurer, and not, in the words of the statute, \"a defendant covered by liability insurance,\" it does not come within the compass of the statute.  It argues that the phrase \"written offer to the defendant's insurer\" is directed at the situation where the decision to settle is not within the control of the defendant, but lies with defendant's insurer.  The purpose of the statute, Amica concludes, is to protect a defendant who is insured from interest liability in excess of the policy limits due to a decision made by the insurer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an ingenious argument;  it uses the strict construction doctrine to avoid the plain meaning of the statute.  But it ignores the legal fact that the action against the insurer is a derivative action.  Amica was the insurer of defendant Owen.  The complaint was originally brought against Owen.  Amica was made a defendant under the direct action statute, Sec. 27-7-2, because its insured could not be served with process.  Amica stands in Owen's shoes.  It is both defendant and insurer.  This case started out, in the words of Sec. 27-7-2.2, as a \"civil action in which the defendant is covered by liability insurance.\"   If process had been served on Owen, Amica's handling of the case would have been no different, and it would be making the same argument as to prejudgment interest because in either case it would have to pay the amount found due.  We see no basis in logic or common sense for the argument that Sec. 27-7-2.2 is not applicable to the insurer under the direct action statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Construing the Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amica makes a number of arguments attacking the district court's construction of the statute.  The overarching argument is that the district court did not apply the rules of statutory construction that would have been applied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court and, as a result, improperly construed the statute.  Because our review is de novo without any deference to the district court, we do not think it necessary to discuss point-by-point defendant's attack on the district court opinion.  The only question is whether the ultimate conclusion of the district court should be affirmed.  We are not concerned with the route taken by the court in reaching its result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis with a determination of the purpose of the rejected-settlement-offer statute, Sec. 27-7-2.2.  Although the construction of this statute is one of first impression, the purpose of the prejudgment interest statute, Sec. 9-21-10, has been articulated by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334009\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334009/martin-v-lumbermens-mut-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span> (R.I.1989), the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that the prejudgment interest did not apply to condemnation cases.

We have echoed this finding of settlement purpose.  Roy v. Star Chopper Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360149\"><a href=\"/opinion/360149/paula-h-roy-v-star-chopper-company-inc-and-third-party-v-ashok/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1135 (1st Cir.1978) (\"The Rhode Island prejudgment statute was enacted to promote the expeditious settlement of claims.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it plain from its terms that the rejected-settlement-offer statute has the same purpose as the prejudgment interest statute--to accelerate the settlement of tort cases.  This purpose is readily apparent from its provision that if the plaintiff's offer of settlement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>is rejected by the defendant's insurer then the defendant's insurer shall be liable for all interest due on the judgment entered by the court even if the payment of the judgment and interest thereon totals a sum in excess of the policy coverage limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 27-7-2.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This language tells the insurer in no uncertain terms that it runs the risk of paying a stiff price for shrugging off an offer of settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the wording of the two implicated statutes.  The prejudgment interest statute says:  \"In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision is made for pecuniary damages,\" interest shall be added to the amount of damages from the date the cause of action accrued.  Sec.  9-21-10.  It is beyond cavil that this case was a civil action, that plaintiff's offer of settlement was for an amount \"equal to ... the coverage limits on the liability policy in force at the time the action accrue[d], and the offer was rejected by the insurer.\"   Section 27-7-2.2.  It is manifest that the prejudgment interest statute applies directly to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also seems evident to us that, by its very words, Sec. 27-7-2.2 requires the payment of prejudgment interest.  It says that if the plaintiff's offer is rejected \"then the defendant's insurer shall be liable for all interest due on the judgment entered by the court even if the payment of the judgment and interest thereon totals a sum in excess of the policy coverage limitation.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Despite the labored argument of defendants to the contrary, it seems obvious that \"all interest\" can only mean prejudgment and postjudgment interest.  And this is the only interpretation that makes sense if the purpose of the statute is to promote settlement, as is obvious.  There would be no pressure on the insurer to consider a settlement offer if all it had to pay for rejecting the offer was post-judgment interest.  Defendant's suggested construction of the statute would take all of the bite out of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the following statement by the Rhode Island Supreme Court applies to the statute in issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of a statute so clear and unambiguous there is no room for the application of the usual canons of statutory construction.  In such a case the statute declares itself.  Vezina v. Bodreau, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2340378\"><a href=\"/opinion/2340378/vezina-v-bodreau/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>;  Long v.

We may not where no ambiguity exists search beyond the statute for a different meaning.  Hathaway v. Hathaway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3866539\"><a href=\"/opinion/4106755/hathaway-v-hathaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3866539\"><a href=\"/opinion/4106755/hathaway-v-hathaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>.   Even hardship does not justify a court in reading into a statute something contrary to its unequivocal language.  Clark v. Orabona, 1st Cir., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span>.   Only when the legislature sounds an uncertain trumpet may the court move in to clarify the call.  But when the call is clear and certain as it is here we may not consider whether the statute as written comports with our ideas of justice, expediency or sound public policy.  In such circumstances that is not the court's business.  Blais v. Franklin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3870500\"><a href=\"/opinion/4110554/blais-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3870500\"><a href=\"/opinion/4110554/blais-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kastal v.

Of the more than thirty states surveyed, many have prejudgment interest statutes accompanied by rejected-settlement-offer provisions, or separate statutes that are invoked in tandem to expedite claims settlement.  See, e.g., Cal.Civ.Code Sec. 3291 (West Supp.1993);  Conn.Gen.Stat. Sec. 52-192a(b);  Minn.Stat.Ann. Sec. 549.09, subd. 1(b) (West Supp.1993);  Mo.Ann.Stat. Sec. 408.040.2 (Vernon 1990);  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. Sec. 1343.03(C) (Anderson Supp.1993).  Our survey has not disclosed a single instance where prejudgment interest has been held not to apply to a rejected-settlement-offer statute.  Given the rejected-settlement-offer statute's plain language and the Rhode Island courts' long history of applying the prejudgment interest statute in tort cases, we think the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply its prejudgment interest statute to the rejected-settlement-offer statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
