These appeals  arise out of\n                                   \n\nplaintiff  James Censullo's  suit  for  wrongful termination  and\n\nother claims.    Censullo won  in a  jury trial  on the  wrongful\n\ntermination ground only.  Appellant Brenka Video in appeal number\n\n92-2137 asks this court to reverse  the denial of its motions for\n\ndirected  verdict and  judgment notwithstanding the  verdict, and\n\nremand  the case to enter  judgment for Brenka  Video on wrongful\n\ntermination.   Appellant James Censullo in  appeal number 92-2193\n\nfirst asks us to rule that Brenka Video was required to indemnify\n\nDavid Bowders, Censullo's  immediate supervisor,  for the  amount\n\nawarded against him in  default judgment.  Censullo next  asks us\n\nto reverse the  exclusion of a newspaper article  as hearsay.  We\n\naffirm the judgments in both appeals.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          On November 14, 1989,  Censullo's wife gave birth to  a\n\ngravely ill child in New Hampshire.  The child was transferred to\n\nBoston  Children's Hospital,  accompanied by  the Censullos.   On\n\nNovember  20,  the  child  underwent  a  six  and  one-half  hour\n\noperation, following  which his chances of  survival were thought\n\nto  be slim at  best.  The  parents stayed at  the hospital until\n\nafter November 24.\n\n          Brenka Video,  a distributor  of home  videos, employed\n\nJames Censullo,  pursuant to  an employment contract,  as manager\n\nfor the New England region until November 24, 1989.  On that day,\n\nCensullo was contacted by his supervisor, David Bowders.  Bowders\n\nsought to determine when Censullo would return to work.  Censullo\n\n                               -3-\n\nexplained  that his son's condition was very serious, and thus he\n\ndid not know when he would return to work.  Bowders told Censullo\n\nthat he  needed to straighten  out his priorities,  and determine\n\nwhether it would be \"better to suffer one loss or two,\" referring\n\nto the losses of a  son and a job.  Censullo later called Bowders\n\nsupervisor, David  Perrier, who  concurred  that Censullo  should\n\nseparate    his   personal    problems    from    his    business\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n          Bowders  called  Censullo  back, saying  that  Censullo\n\nwould  receive  a  telegram shortly  as  a  result  of the  phone\n\nconversations and for \"going  over my head.\"  The  telegram which\n\narrived  later that day, stated that  Censullo was terminated for\n\npoor  performance.    Brenka  Video contends  that  Censullo  had\n\nalready  been  placed on  probation  because  he needed  frequent\n\nredirection, reprimand, and intervention by supervisors.\n\n          On November 30, an article appeared in the Boston Globe\n\nentitled \"A Heart of Stone\" detailing Censullo's termination from\n\nBrenka  Video.  On the same day, Brenka Video reinstated Censullo\n\nand  placed  him on  \"administrative  leave.\"   Censullo  did not\n\ncomply  with  the terms  of  the  administrative leave,  and  was\n\nterminated again on December 14.\n\n          Censullo sued  Brenka Video,  Bowders, and  Perrier for\n\nwrongful termination, breach of contract, and other claims.  When\n\nBowders  failed to  appear,  the district  court entered  default\n\njudgment against him totaling $250,000.   The district court also\n\nrefused to  require Brenka  Video to indemnify  Bowders for  this\n\n                               -4-\n\njudgment.  \n\n          The case proceeded to  trial against Perrier and Brenka\n\nVideo.   Censullo  sought  to introduce  the article  entitled \"A\n\nHeart  of Stone\" to show  Brenka Video's motive  in rehiring him.\n\nThe district court excluded the opinion portions  of the article,\n\nbut admitted the factual portions into evidence.\n\n          The  jury  found  for  Censullo only  on  the  wrongful\n\ntermination claim,  and assessed  $73,000 in damages.   The  jury\n\nfound for Brenka  Video on the  breach of contract  claims.   The\n\ndistrict court denied Brenka Video's motions for directed verdict\n\nand  for judgment  notwithstanding  the verdict.   These  appeals\n\nfollowed, and we address them in turn.\n\n                      APPEAL OF BRENKA VIDEO\n                                            \n\n          Brenka  Video contends  that the  district  court, upon\n\nmotions  for directed  verdict and  judgment notwithstanding  the\n\nverdict, should have  reversed the jury  verdict for Censullo  on\n\nwrongful termination.   According  to Brenka Video,  only at-will\n\nemployees can make a claim for wrongful termination, and Censullo\n\ncould not have been an at-will employee.\n\n          We review the district  court's decisions on motions to\n\ndirect a verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the  verdict on\n\nthe same standard.   We examine  the evidence  in the light  most\n\nfavorable to  the  plaintiff, and  determine whether  there is  a\n\ntotal  lack of evidence in support of  plaintiff's case.  Mayo v.\n                                                              \n\nSchooner Capital Corporation, 825 F.2d 566,  568 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                            \n\nThe  district  court  properly  grants  these  motions  when  the\n\n                               -5-\n\nevidence  allows  a  reasonable  person  to  arrive  at  only one\n\nconclusion.  Conway v. Electro  Switch Corporation, 825 F.2d 593,\n                                                  \n\n598 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Under the  governing  law of  New Hampshire,  employees\n\nfall into two classes:  contract employees and at-will employees.\n\nPanto  v. Moore  Business Forms,  Inc., 547  A.2d 260,  267 (N.H.\n                                      \n\n1988).    Contract employees  are limited  in their  remedies for\n\nbreach by the terms of  the contract.  Id.  In  contrast, at-will\n                                          \n\nemployees are  limited in their  remedies to claims  for wrongful\n\ntermination.1   Cloutier v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 436\n                                                            \n\nA.2d 1140, 1143 (N.H. 1981).\n\n          Censullo was a contract employee until November 24.  We\n\nmust determine whether  the evidence could support a finding that\n\nCensullo's  status  changed  after  November  24  to  an  at-will\n\nemployee, such that the second termination could be wrongful.  As\n\nthe  jury found a wrongful  termination, we view  the evidence in\n\nthe light  most favorable to  this finding.   In this  light, the\n\nevidence sufficiently supports the jury finding.\n\n          The president of Brenka  Video sent Censullo a telegram\n\non the same day that the \"A Heart of Stone\" article appeared.  It\n\ninformed Censullo that the initial termination had been reversed,\n\n                    \n\n1  While an employer has great discretion to terminate an at will\nemployee,  he may not  do so when  he is motivated  by bad faith,\nmalice  or retaliation.  Cloutier v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea\n                                                                 \nCo.,  436 A.2d  1140, 1143  (N.H. 1981).   To  state a  claim for\n   \nwrongful termination,  the employee  must also  show that  he was\nterminated   for  doing  something   that  public   policy  would\nencourage,  or refusing to do something  that public policy would\ncondemn.   Id.   As  these elements  of the  wrongful termination\n              \nclaim are not in dispute here, we discuss them no further.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nthat Censullo  had not been removed from  Brenka Video's payroll,\n\ncould continue to  cash his  paychecks, and was  relieved of  his\n\nworking responsibilities.  The president assured Censullo that \"I\n\nwill  personally  get  back to  you.\"    The  next day,  Censullo\n\nreceived  a telegram  from  Brenka Video's  controller explaining\n\nthat  Censullo had  not  at any  time  been removed  from  active\n\nemployee  status,  but  was considered  to  be  on an  indefinite\n\nadministrative leave.   When Censullo's \"personal  situation\" was\n\nresolved,  Censullo was to meet with Brenka Video to \"discuss the\n\nconditions  and  standards\"   of  continued   employment.     The\n\ncontroller  asked   Censullo  to  check  in   with  Brenka  Video\n\nregularly. \n\n          In the ensuing period,  Censullo did not contact Brenka\n\nVideo.   He cashed two paychecks  and kept two others.   He later\n\nexplained that  he considered himself  at all times  a terminated\n\nemployee,  and cashed two checks  as severance pay.   On December\n\n14, Censullo received  another communication terminating him  for\n\nfailure to comply with the administrative leave.\n\n          Censullo's own views  notwithstanding, we believe  that\n\nthe jury could find that Censullo became an at-will employee as a\n\nresult of  the telegrams from  Brenka Video's principals.   Those\n\ntelegrams relieved Censullo of  the job he had contracted  to do,\n\nand  placed him in a  nebulous administrative leave  status.  The\n\nparties  would later fix the  terms of continued  employment.  As\n\nthe telegrams contained no terms limiting Brenka Video's power to\n\nterminate  Censullo,  the jury  reasonably  could  find that  the\n\n                               -7-\n\ntelegrams created an at-will relationship.\n\n          Brenka  Video asserts  that while  the telegrams  could\n\nconstitute an offer of at-will employment status, such status was\n\nnot  effective until Censullo accepted  the offer, which he never\n\ndid.   While we agree  that Censullo  bore the burden  of showing\n\nacceptance of the offer, see Panto, 547 A.2d at  264, we disagree\n                                  \n\nas to  whether Censullo actually met  his burden.   In Panto, the\n                                                            \n\nNew Hampshire  Supreme Court  found that an  employee accepted  a\n\nchange in employment status by merely performing as called for by\n\nthe  change.  Id. at 265.  In this case, the jury could find that\n                 \n\nCensullo had accepted the  change in status by doing  nothing and\n\ncashing  his paychecks, which is  what the telegram  asked him to\n\ndo.   Censullo  did  not comply  with  the telegram  from  Brenka\n\nVideo's controller urging Censullo to  check in with the  company\n\nperiodically.  The letter from Brenka Video's president, however,\n\nindicated that the company would be  in touch with Censullo.  The\n\njury could  have determined  that the letter  from the  president\n\nmore accurately stated the requirements of the change in status.\n\n          The jury  could have found from  the evidence presented\n\nat trial that Censullo became  an at-will employee after November\n\n24.   Therefore, a finding  of wrongful  termination was  proper.\n\nThe district court did not err in failing to grant Brenka Video's\n\nmotions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict.  \n\n                     APPEAL OF JAMES CENSULLO\n                                             \n\n          Censullo's  first argument  on  appeal is  that  Brenka\n\n                               -8-\n\nVideo  is   vicariously  liable  for  the   tort  of  intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress  committed by its employee David\n\nBowders.    Censullo's  current  claim   of  vicarious  liability\n\ndeviates from his  original claim of indemnification.  We address\n\nit  in an abundance  of caution, however,  noting that Censullo's\n\ncomplaint  at  least   contained  an  allegation   of  respondeat\n\nsuperior.  For reasons that parallel those of the district court,\n\nwe find the current claim meritless.\n\n          Censullo presented this issue  to the district court in\n\na \"Motion to Assess Damages and for Indemnification,\" seeking  to\n\nrecover  for the default  against Bowders through indemnification\n\nof  Bowders from  Brenka Video.   The  district court  denied the\n\nmotion because  Censullo cited  no authority for  the proposition\n\nthat  an employer must indemnify an employee.  The district court\n\nnoted that normally, when  the negligence of an agent  is imputed\n\nto  the principal, the principal  may recover from  the agent the\n\namount paid as indemnification.   Furthermore, the district court\n\nalready ruled that the state workmen's compensation scheme barred\n\nCensullo from  recovering from  Brenka Video for  the intentional\n\ninfliction  of emotional  distress.   The court  thus found  that\n\ngranting the  motion would  allow Censullo to  recover indirectly\n\nfrom Brenka Video when he could not do so directly.\n\n          The district  court correctly found that  the workmen's\n\ncompensation statute bars  employees from  suing their  employers\n\nfor personal injuries arising out of the employment relationship.\n\nO'Keefe  v. Associated Grocers of  N.E., Inc., 424  A.2d 199, 201\n                                             \n\n                               -9-\n\n(N.H.  1980).   Emotional  distress  is  a personal  injury,  not\n\nsubject  to recovery in a common law action under state workmen's\n\ncompensation statute.  See Bourque  v. Town of Bow, 736 F.  Supp.\n                                                  \n\n398, 404 (D.N.H. 1990).\n\n          The district court also correctly held, in granting the\n\ndefault judgment, that Censullo  could sue his co-employee acting\n\nas a supervisor for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThompson  v.  Forest, 614  A.2d  1064,  1067  (N.H. 1992)  (under\n                    \n\nworkmen's  compensation scheme,  co-employee  not immunized  from\n\nsuit for intentional torts).   While Thompson authorizes Censullo\n                                             \n\nto raise a claim of  intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\nagainst his  co-employee Bowders, it  does not authorize  such an\n\naction against Brenka  Video, his employer.  Indeed, according to\n\na leading commentator, \"when  the intentional injury is committed\n\nby a  co-employee the better  rule is that  an action in  damages\n\nwill not lie against the employer . . . .\"  2A Arthur Larson, The\n                                                                 \n\nLaw  of Workmen's Compensation    68.00 (1992).   Because we find\n                              \n\nthat  Censullo  has  not  stated   a  valid  claim  on  vicarious\n\nliability, we affirm the district court's order.\n\n          Censullo's second argument,  the only one  remaining in\n\nthis appeal,  relates to the  admission of the  newspaper article\n\nentitled  \"A  Heart   of  Stone.\"    As  Censullo  conceded  that\n\nresolution  of this issue is unnecessary unless we were to remand\n\nthe case for a new  trial, and we have found no reason  to do so,\n\nwe do not reach this issue.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                               -10-\n\n            Cases 92-2137 and 92-2193 are dismissed.\n\n                               -11-\n",

These appeals  arise out of\n                                   \n\nplaintiff  James Censullo's  suit  for  wrongful termination  and\n\nother claims.    Censullo won  in a  jury trial  on the  wrongful\n\ntermination ground only.  Appellant Brenka Video in appeal number\n\n92-2137 asks this court to reverse  the denial of its motions for\n\ndirected  verdict and  judgment notwithstanding the  verdict, and\n\nremand  the case to enter  judgment for Brenka  Video on wrongful\n\ntermination.   Appellant James Censullo in  appeal number 92-2193\n\nfirst asks us to rule that Brenka Video was required to indemnify\n\nDavid Bowders, Censullo's  immediate supervisor,  for the  amount\n\nawarded against him in  default judgment.  Censullo next  asks us\n\nto reverse the  exclusion of a newspaper article  as hearsay.  We\n\naffirm the judgments in both appeals.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          On November 14, 1989,  Censullo's wife gave birth to  a\n\ngravely ill child in New Hampshire.  The child was transferred to\n\nBoston  Children's Hospital,  accompanied by  the Censullos.   On\n\nNovember  20,  the  child  underwent  a  six  and  one-half  hour\n\noperation, following  which his chances of  survival were thought\n\nto  be slim at  best.  The  parents stayed at  the hospital until\n\nafter November 24.\n\n          Brenka Video,  a distributor  of home  videos, employed\n\nJames Censullo,  pursuant to  an employment contract,  as manager\n\nfor the New England region until November 24, 1989.  On that day,\n\nCensullo was contacted by his supervisor, David Bowders.  Bowders\n\nsought to determine when Censullo would return to work.  Censullo\n\n                               -3-\n\nexplained  that his son's condition was very serious, and thus he\n\ndid not know when he would return to work.  Bowders told Censullo\n\nthat he  needed to straighten  out his priorities,  and determine\n\nwhether it would be \"better to suffer one loss or two,\" referring\n\nto the losses of a  son and a job.  Censullo later called Bowders\n\nsupervisor, David  Perrier, who  concurred  that Censullo  should\n\nseparate    his   personal    problems    from    his    business\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n          Bowders  called  Censullo  back, saying  that  Censullo\n\nwould  receive  a  telegram shortly  as  a  result  of the  phone\n\nconversations and for \"going  over my head.\"  The  telegram which\n\narrived  later that day, stated that  Censullo was terminated for\n\npoor  performance.    Brenka  Video contends  that  Censullo  had\n\nalready  been  placed on  probation  because  he needed  frequent\n\nredirection, reprimand, and intervention by supervisors.\n\n          On November 30, an article appeared in the Boston Globe\n\nentitled \"A Heart of Stone\" detailing Censullo's termination from\n\nBrenka  Video.  On the same day, Brenka Video reinstated Censullo\n\nand  placed  him on  \"administrative  leave.\"   Censullo  did not\n\ncomply  with  the terms  of  the  administrative leave,  and  was\n\nterminated again on December 14.\n\n          Censullo sued  Brenka Video,  Bowders, and  Perrier for\n\nwrongful termination, breach of contract, and other claims.  When\n\nBowders  failed to  appear,  the district  court entered  default\n\njudgment against him totaling $250,000.   The district court also\n\nrefused to  require Brenka  Video to indemnify  Bowders for  this\n\n                               -4-\n\njudgment.  \n\n          The case proceeded to  trial against Perrier and Brenka\n\nVideo.   Censullo  sought  to introduce  the article  entitled \"A\n\nHeart  of Stone\" to show  Brenka Video's motive  in rehiring him.\n\nThe district court excluded the opinion portions  of the article,\n\nbut admitted the factual portions into evidence.\n\n          The  jury  found  for  Censullo only  on  the  wrongful\n\ntermination claim,  and assessed  $73,000 in damages.   The  jury\n\nfound for Brenka  Video on the  breach of contract  claims.   The\n\ndistrict court denied Brenka Video's motions for directed verdict\n\nand  for judgment  notwithstanding  the verdict.   These  appeals\n\nfollowed, and we address them in turn.\n\n                      APPEAL OF BRENKA VIDEO\n                                            \n\n          Brenka  Video contends  that the  district  court, upon\n\nmotions  for directed  verdict and  judgment notwithstanding  the\n\nverdict, should have  reversed the jury  verdict for Censullo  on\n\nwrongful termination.   According  to Brenka Video,  only at-will\n\nemployees can make a claim for wrongful termination, and Censullo\n\ncould not have been an at-will employee.\n\n          We review the district  court's decisions on motions to\n\ndirect a verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the  verdict on\n\nthe same standard.   We examine  the evidence  in the light  most\n\nfavorable to  the  plaintiff, and  determine whether  there is  a\n\ntotal  lack of evidence in support of  plaintiff's case.

In  contrast, at-will\n                                          \n\nemployees are  limited in their  remedies to claims  for wrongful\n\ntermination.1   Cloutier v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1143 (N.H. 1981).\n\n          Censullo was a contract employee until November 24.  We\n\nmust determine whether  the evidence could support a finding that\n\nCensullo's  status  changed  after  November  24  to  an  at-will\n\nemployee, such that the second termination could be wrongful.  As\n\nthe  jury found a wrongful  termination, we view  the evidence in\n\nthe light  most favorable to  this finding.   In this  light, the\n\nevidence sufficiently supports the jury finding.\n\n          The president of Brenka  Video sent Censullo a telegram\n\non the same day that the \"A Heart of Stone\" article appeared.  It\n\ninformed Censullo that the initial termination had been reversed,\n\n                    \n\n1  While an employer has great discretion to terminate an at will\nemployee,  he may not  do so when  he is motivated  by bad faith,\nmalice  or retaliation.  Cloutier v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea\n                                                                 \nCo.,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1140</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1143  (N.H. 1981).   To  state a  claim for\n   \nwrongful termination,  the employee  must also  show that  he was\nterminated   for  doing  something   that  public   policy  would\nencourage,  or refusing to do something  that public policy would\ncondemn.   Id.   As  these elements  of the  wrongful termination\n              \nclaim are not in dispute here, we discuss them no further.  \n\n                               -6-\n\nthat Censullo  had not been removed from  Brenka Video's payroll,\n\ncould continue to  cash his  paychecks, and was  relieved of  his\n\nworking responsibilities.  The president assured Censullo that \"I\n\nwill  personally  get  back to  you.\"    The  next day,  Censullo\n\nreceived  a telegram  from  Brenka Video's  controller explaining\n\nthat  Censullo had  not  at any  time  been removed  from  active\n\nemployee  status,  but  was considered  to  be  on an  indefinite\n\nadministrative leave.   When Censullo's \"personal  situation\" was\n\nresolved,  Censullo was to meet with Brenka Video to \"discuss the\n\nconditions  and  standards\"   of  continued   employment.     The\n\ncontroller  asked   Censullo  to  check  in   with  Brenka  Video\n\nregularly. \n\n          In the ensuing period,  Censullo did not contact Brenka\n\nVideo.   He cashed two paychecks  and kept two others.   He later\n\nexplained that  he considered himself  at all times  a terminated\n\nemployee,  and cashed two checks  as severance pay.   On December\n\n14, Censullo received  another communication terminating him  for\n\nfailure to comply with the administrative leave.\n\n          Censullo's own views  notwithstanding, we believe  that\n\nthe jury could find that Censullo became an at-will employee as a\n\nresult of  the telegrams from  Brenka Video's principals.   Those\n\ntelegrams relieved Censullo of  the job he had contracted  to do,\n\nand  placed him in a  nebulous administrative leave  status.  The\n\nparties  would later fix the  terms of continued  employment.  As\n\nthe telegrams contained no terms limiting Brenka Video's power to\n\nterminate  Censullo,  the jury  reasonably  could  find that  the\n\n                               -7-\n\ntelegrams created an at-will relationship.\n\n          Brenka  Video asserts  that while  the telegrams  could\n\nconstitute an offer of at-will employment status, such status was\n\nnot  effective until Censullo accepted  the offer, which he never\n\ndid.   While we agree  that Censullo  bore the burden  of showing\n\nacceptance of the offer, see Panto, 547 A.2d at  264, we disagree\n                                  \n\nas to  whether Censullo actually met  his burden.   In Panto, the\n                                                            \n\nNew Hampshire  Supreme Court  found that an  employee accepted  a\n\nchange in employment status by merely performing as called for by\n\nthe  change.  Id. at 265.  In this case, the jury could find that\n                 \n\nCensullo had accepted the  change in status by doing  nothing and\n\ncashing  his paychecks, which is  what the telegram  asked him to\n\ndo.   Censullo  did  not comply  with  the telegram  from  Brenka\n\nVideo's controller urging Censullo to  check in with the  company\n\nperiodically.  The letter from Brenka Video's president, however,\n\nindicated that the company would be  in touch with Censullo.  The\n\njury could  have determined  that the letter  from the  president\n\nmore accurately stated the requirements of the change in status.\n\n          The jury  could have found from  the evidence presented\n\nat trial that Censullo became  an at-will employee after November\n\n24.   Therefore, a finding  of wrongful  termination was  proper.\n\nThe district court did not err in failing to grant Brenka Video's\n\nmotions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict.  \n\n                     APPEAL OF JAMES CENSULLO\n                                             \n\n          Censullo's  first argument  on  appeal is  that  Brenka\n\n                               -8-\n\nVideo  is   vicariously  liable  for  the   tort  of  intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress  committed by its employee David\n\nBowders.    Censullo's  current  claim   of  vicarious  liability\n\ndeviates from his  original claim of indemnification.  We address\n\nit  in an abundance  of caution, however,  noting that Censullo's\n\ncomplaint  at  least   contained  an  allegation   of  respondeat\n\nsuperior.  For reasons that parallel those of the district court,\n\nwe find the current claim meritless.\n\n          Censullo presented this issue  to the district court in\n\na \"Motion to Assess Damages and for Indemnification,\" seeking  to\n\nrecover  for the default  against Bowders through indemnification\n\nof  Bowders from  Brenka Video.   The  district court  denied the\n\nmotion because  Censullo cited  no authority for  the proposition\n\nthat  an employer must indemnify an employee.  The district court\n\nnoted that normally, when  the negligence of an agent  is imputed\n\nto  the principal, the principal  may recover from  the agent the\n\namount paid as indemnification.   Furthermore, the district court\n\nalready ruled that the state workmen's compensation scheme barred\n\nCensullo from  recovering from  Brenka Video for  the intentional\n\ninfliction  of emotional  distress.   The court  thus found  that\n\ngranting the  motion would  allow Censullo to  recover indirectly\n\nfrom Brenka Video when he could not do so directly.\n\n          The district  court correctly found that  the workmen's\n\ncompensation statute bars  employees from  suing their  employers\n\nfor personal injuries arising out of the employment relationship.\n\nO'Keefe  v. Associated Grocers of  N.E., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201\n                                             \n\n                               -9-\n\n(N.H.  1980).   Emotional  distress  is  a personal  injury,  not\n\nsubject  to recovery in a common law action under state workmen's\n\ncompensation statute.  See Bourque  v. Town of Bow, 736 F.  Supp.\n                                                  \n\n398, 404 (D.N.H. 1990).\n\n          The district court also correctly held, in granting the\n\ndefault judgment, that Censullo  could sue his co-employee acting\n\nas a supervisor for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThompson  v.  Forest, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1064</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1067  (N.H. 1992)  (under\n                    \n\nworkmen's  compensation scheme,  co-employee  not immunized  from\n\nsuit for intentional torts).   While Thompson authorizes Censullo\n                                             \n\nto raise a claim of  intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\nagainst his  co-employee Bowders, it  does not authorize  such an\n\naction against Brenka  Video, his employer.  Indeed, according to\n\na leading commentator, \"when  the intentional injury is committed\n\nby a  co-employee the better  rule is that  an action in  damages\n\nwill not lie against the employer . . . .\"  2A Arthur Larson, The\n                                                                 \n\nLaw  of Workmen's Compensation    68.00 (1992).   Because we find\n                              \n\nthat  Censullo  has  not  stated   a  valid  claim  on  vicarious\n\nliability, we affirm the district court's order.\n\n          Censullo's second argument,  the only one  remaining in\n\nthis appeal,  relates to the  admission of the  newspaper article\n\nentitled  \"A  Heart   of  Stone.\"    As  Censullo  conceded  that\n\nresolution  of this issue is unnecessary unless we were to remand\n\nthe case for a new  trial, and we have found no reason  to do so,\n\nwe do not reach this issue.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                               -10-\n\n            Cases 92-2137 and 92-2193 are dismissed.\n\n                               -11-\n</pre>",
