Appellant Luis M. Estrada, Jr. filed a\n                    \n\ncivil rights action  in the Rhode Island district  court.  He\n\nis serving  a sentence pursuant to a  Rhode Island conviction\n\nand  currently is incarcerated in the federal penitentiary in\n\nTerre Haute, Indiana.   He raises two issues on  appeal:  (1)\n\nwhether his constitutional  right of access to the courts has\n\nbeen infringed due to his  incarceration in Indiana; and  (2)\n\nwhether he has a constitutional right of access to his prison\n\nfiles to correct allegedly erroneous information placed there\n\nas a result  of the investigation leading up  to the transfer\n\ndecision.  Although the district  court did not address these\n\nissues, the generality of the first claim and the speculative\n\nnature of the second make a remand unnecessary.\n\n          We  review a  grant of  summary  judgment de  novo.\n                                                            \n\nGoldman v.  First Nat'l Bank  of Boston, 985 F.2d  1113, 1116\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.  1993).   In so doing,  we view  the record  in the\n\nlight   most  favorable  to   the  nonmovant,  indulging  all\n\nreasonable inferences in  his or her favor.   Garside v. Osco\n                                                             \n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).  In  relation to\n          \n\nissues on which appellant bears the burden of proof, however,\n\nhe  is obligated to \"reliably demonstrate that specific facts\n\nsufficient to  create an authentic  dispute exist.\"   See id.\n                                                             \n\nThat is, he \"must produce evidence which would  be admissible\n\nat trial to  make out the requisite issue  of material fact.\"\n\nSee Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355,357 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                          \n\n          A.  Access to Courts\n                              \n\n          It is \"established beyond doubt that prisoners have\n\na constitutional right  of access to the courts.\"   Bounds v.\n                                                          \n\nSmith,  430 U.S.  817, 821  (1977).   To meet  this standard,\n     \n\nprison  authorities must  \"assist inmates in  the preparation\n\nand  filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners\n\nwith  adequate  law  libraries or  adequate  assistance  from\n\npersons trained in the law.\"   Id. at 828 (footnote omitted).\n                                  \n\nAppellant has alleged the  following facts in support  of his\n\nassertion that prison officials have not met the requirements\n\nof Bounds.\n         \n\n          First, he states that the prison library in Indiana\n\ndoes not  contain any  sources of Rhode  Island law  and that\n\nthere is no one at the prison familiar with Rhode Island law.\n\nThis situation has  impeded appellant in the prosecution of a\n\nstate  post-conviction   review  proceeding  to   reduce  his\n\nsentence; he asserts that  the matter currently is on  appeal\n\nand  that he  has had to  file a \"pre-brief  statement in the\n\nblind.\"   Appellant has  not submitted copies  of any  of the\n\npleadings he has filed in the state courts nor does  he refer\n\nto the titles or docket  numbers of these alleged state court\n\nactions.\n\n          The  ACI  official, Joseph  DiNitto,  who  has been\n\nappointed to assist  appellant with his  legal needs wrote  a\n\nletter  to appellant.   In it,  he states  that there  are no\n\n                             -3-\n\ncases  concerning  appellant  pending  in  the  Rhode  Island\n\nSupreme Court and  only one case in the  state Superior Court\n\n(in which no action had been taken  for several months).   In\n\nthe letter, DiNitto also offers  to assist appellant with his\n\nlegal  needs.   However,  DiNitto  goes  on,  appellant  must\n\nprovide more  detailed information  concerning the status  of\n\nhis state  cases  and must  be more  specific concerning  the\n\nresearch  material  appellant  requires.    Finally,  DiNitto\n\ninquired  whether appellant had  contacted the Office  of the\n\nPublic Defender for assistance.\n\n          Based on the above, we  do not think that appellant\n\nhas  submitted   sufficient  evidence   to  demonstrate   the\n\nexistence of an issue of material fact.  Significantly, there\n\nis no indication  that appellant ever responded  to DiNitto's\n\nletter.  The  fact that appellant was \"highly skeptical\" that\n\nDiNitto could held him is,  at best, an \"arrant  speculation\"\n\nand cannot  suffice to defeat  summary judgment.   See Kelly,\n                                                            \n\n924 F.2d at 357.  The letter requested reasonable information\n\nand, in the absence of  any evidence that upon receiving such\n\ndata  from  appellant,  DiNitto   would  not  have   provided\n\nassistance, the letter  represents adequate assistance  under\n\nBounds.  \n      \n\n          B.  Access to Prison Files\n                                    \n\n          Cases  have uniformly held  that a prisoner  has no\n\nconstitutional  right of access  to his or  her prison files.\n\n                             -4-\n\nSee, e.g.,  Slocum  v.  Georgia  State  Bd.  of  Pardons  and\n                                                             \n\nParoles, 678  F.2d 940,  942 (11th  Cir.), cert.  denied, 459\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  1043 (1982);  Paine v.  Baker, 595  F.2d 197,  200 (4th\n                                   \n\nCir.)  (prisoner has  no constitutional  right  of access  to\n\nprison files),  cert. denied, 444  U.S. 925  (1979); Cook  v.\n                                                         \n\nWhiteside,  505  F.2d 32,  34  (5th Cir.  1974)  (\"failure of\n         \n\n[parole] Board to  allow [prisoner] to see his  file does not\n\nassume the proportions of  a deprivation of his rights  under\n\nthe   Constitution  or  the  laws  of  the  United  States\").\n\nAppellant  argues  that in  his  case,  this  rule should  be\n\nrelaxed  and  that  prison officials  should  be  required to\n\nexpunge the allegedly erroneous information.\n\n          In support  of his  claim, appellant first  asserts\n\nthat  if  an  inmate  has  been  found  guilty  based  on  an\n\n\"institutional report,\"  good-time credits are deducted  on a\n\nday-for-day basis for  each day spent in lockup.   His second\n\nargument is that he is  scheduled to appear before the parole\n\nboard  in February 1994  and that the  inaccurate information\n\ncan be relied on by the board.  Both of these occurrences, he\n\nconcludes,   implicate  his   constitutional   rights  to   a\n\nsignificant degree.  We think that these allegations are  too\n\nuncertain  to create a  question of material  fact concerning\n\nwhether appellant is entitled to equitable relief.  See Lopez\n                                                             \n\nv.

This situation has impeded appellant in the prosecution of a state post-conviction review proceeding to reduce his sentence;  he asserts that the matter currently is on appeal and that he has had to file a \"pre-brief statement in the blind.\"  Appellant has not submitted copies of any of the pleadings he has filed in the state courts nor does he refer to the titles or docket numbers of these alleged state court actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACI official, Joseph DiNitto, who has been appointed to assist appellant with his legal needs wrote a letter to appellant.  In it, he states that there are no cases concerning appellant pending in the Rhode Island Supreme Court and only one case in the state Superior Court (in which no action had been taken for several months).  In the letter, DiNitto also offers to assist appellant with his legal needs.  However, DiNitto goes on, appellant must provide more detailed information concerning the status of his state cases and must be more specific concerning the research material appellant requires.  Finally, DiNitto inquired whether appellant had contacted the Office of the Public Defender for assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the above, we do not think that appellant has submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of an issue of material fact.  Significantly, there is no indication that appellant ever responded to DiNitto's letter.  The fact that appellant was \"highly skeptical\" that DiNitto could held him is, at best, an \"arrant speculation\" and cannot suffice to defeat summary judgment.   See Kelly, 924 F.2d at 357.  The letter requested reasonable information and, in the absence of any evidence that upon receiving such data from appellant, DiNitto would not have provided assistance, the letter represents adequate assistance under Bounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Access to Prison Files</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cases have uniformly held that a prisoner has no constitutional right of access to his or her prison files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See, e.g., Slocum v. Georgia State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403867\"><a href=\"/opinion/403867/harry-slocum-v-georgia-state-board-of-pardons-and-paroles-james-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span>, 942 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></span> (1982);   Paine v.

Appellant argues that in his case, this rule should be relaxed and that prison officials should be required to expunge the allegedly erroneous information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his claim, appellant first asserts that if an inmate has been found guilty based on an \"institutional report,\" good-time credits are deducted on a day-for-day basis for each day spent in lockup.  His second argument is that he is scheduled to appear before the parole board in February 1994 and that the inaccurate information can be relied on by the board.  Both of these occurrences, he concludes, implicate his constitutional rights to a significant degree.  We think that these allegations are too uncertain to create a question of material fact concerning whether appellant is entitled to equitable relief.   See Lopez v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550303\"><a href=\"/opinion/550303/celso-lopez-aka-celso-lopez-lopez-v-rd-garriga/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir. 1990) (to obtain injunctive relief, plaintiff must show that there is a likelihood that defendants will engage in unlawful conduct in the future).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
