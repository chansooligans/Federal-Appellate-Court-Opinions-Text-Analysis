Abruzzi Foods, Inc. brought\n                              \n\nthis diversity action against  a competitor, Pasta &amp; Cheese,\n\nInc. (and its parent).   Abruzzi claims that Pasta  &amp; Cheese\n\nhas  violated  chapter  93A  of the  Massachusetts  code  by\n\n\"deceptive[ly]\" calling  its pasta  \"fresh.\"  Mass.  Gen. L.\n\nch. 93A,    2(a) (forbidding  \"unfair or  deceptive acts  or\n\npractices  in the conduct of  any trade or  commerce\"),   11\n\n(permitting civil suits by competitors).  The district court\n\ngranted  the   defendants'  motion  for   summary  judgment.\n\nAbruzzi appeals.  We affirm the judgment.\n\n          The determinative legal question is whether or not\n\nAbruzzi,  responding  to  the  defense  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment, \"set forth specific facts,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e),\n\nwhich,  in  this  context,  would  permit  a  factfinder  to\n\nconclude that  the defendants' use  of the word  \"fresh,\" on\n\nits  pasta  labels and  in  its pasta  advertising,  had the\n\n\"capacity  or  tendency or  effect  of  deceiving buyers  or\n\nprospective  buyers in  any material  respect,\" Mass.  Regs.\n\nCode  tit.  940,   3.05(1).   We  have  read the  record and\n\nconclude that it did not.\n\n          Pasta &amp;  Cheese sets  forth by affidavit,  Fed. R.\n\nCiv.  P. 56(c),  important facts  about the  product, namely\n\nthat it is \"not dehydrated, frozen or canned,\" that it is to\n\nbe \"refrigerated .  . . at the store,\" that  it retains \"its\n\nfresh  appearance, texture,  fragrance, and  taste,\"  that a\n\nbuyer is to cook it \"in boiling water for very brief periods\n\nof time,\" and  that it  has a somewhat  limited shelf  life.\n\nPasta &amp; Cheese  also concedes, for argument's  sake, that it\n\n\"pasteurizes\"  the   product  to  \"retard[]   spoilage\"  and\n\n\"preserve  .  .  .  freshness  .  .  .  for  a  commercially\n\nreasonable shelf-life period.\"  Abruzzi does not dispute any\n\nof these  facts.  Rather,  it seeks  to show that  calling a\n\n\"pasteurized\" pasta product \"fresh\" is deceptive.\n\n          The fatal problem for Abruzzi consists of its lack\n\nof evidence that  this is so.  Abruzzi cannot  appeal to the\n\n\"common sense\" of  the matter, for  \"common sense\" does  not\n\nsupport its claim.   Rather, common sense  suggests that the\n\nanswer to  the question, \"Does calling  this product 'fresh'\n\nmislead?\"  is,  \"It  depends.\"    One  might,  for  example,\n\naccurately  call  pasteurized  milk  \"fresh,\"  in  order  to\n\ndistinguish it from condensed or powdered or long-life milk.\n\nSee  FDA, Final Rule, Food Labeling, 58 Fed. Reg. 2302, 2403\n   \n\n(Jan. 6, 1993) (to be codified at 21 C.F.R.   101.95) (since\n                                 \n\n\"consumers   recognize   that    milk   is   nearly   always\n\npasteurized,\"  there is  no danger  of deception  in calling\n\npasteurized milk \"fresh\").   But, to call pasteurized orange\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\njuice \"fresh\" is a different matter.  See id. at 2403; Coca-\n                                                            \n\nCola  Co. v. Tropicana Products, Inc., 690 F.2d 312, 318 (2d\n                                     \n\nCir. 1982) (finding plausible the claim that the advertising\n\nof  pasteurized juice as \"as  it comes from  the orange\" was\n\nfacially false).  Of  course, pasta is  not milk; nor is  it\n\nlike  orange juice, for (despite the  occasional hint to the\n\ncontrary)  pasta does  not  grow on  trees.   All  pasta  is\n\n\"artificial\" in  the sense that it  is manufactured; indeed,\n\nsophisticated  machinery is  necessary to  produce  pasta in\n\n\"commercial\" quantities for supermarkets.   In this context,\n\nthe word  \"fresh\"  might well  (as  Pasta &amp;  Cheese  argues)\n\ndistinguish pasta that  is soft and cooks  quickly and needs\n\nrefrigeration  from pasta  that  is dried  and needs  longer\n\ncooking time, and lasts  almost forever at room temperature.\n\n          Nor  can  Abruzzi  succeed  by  pointing  to  some\n\nspecial   legal  rule,   or  legal   precedent,   that  says\n               \n\n\"pasteurized pasta\" is not \"fresh\" pasta.   The federal Food\n\nand Drug Administration has  recently published rules on the\n\nuse of the word \"fresh.\"  See 58 Fed. Reg. at 2401-07, 2426.\n                             \n\n(Indeed, we have waited to see  what they would say.)  Those\n\nregulations make clear that whether or not the use of such a\n\nword is, or is not, deceptive varies, depending upon product\n\nand context.   The FDA decided  not to promulgate a  rule or\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nregulation governing the use of the  term \"fresh\" as applied\n\nto refrigerated  pasta in  \"extended shelf life\"  packaging,\n\nsuch as  the products  before us.   See id.  at 2406,    335\n                                           \n\n(\"because of the diversity of products in the extended shelf\n\nlife  category  [expressly   including  \"pasta   products\"],\n\n[freshness standards]  for  such products  [are]  not  being\n\naddressed in this  rule\").  Thus,  Abruzzi cannot appeal  to\n\nthe FDA rules for support.\n\n          All this means that  Abruzzi must rely upon record\n                                                            \n\nevidence.  And, Abruzzi does not do well in that department.\n        \n\nIt points to  two items.   First, its  president, Mr.  Mario\n\nBoccabella,  stated in  a  deposition that  \"pasteurization\"\n\namounts  to \"precook[ing]  a  product,\" which  is \"going  to\n\nchange  the  texture  and  the freshness  category  of  that\n\nproduct tremendously,\"  to  the  point  where  \"[y]ou're  no\n\nlonger  dealing with a fresh  product.\"  Other statements by\n\nMr. Boccabella, however, make clear  that he believed it  is\n\nthe drying of the pasta  that makes it \"unfresh.\"  He  said,\n          \n\nfor  example,  that \"before  that  drying  pasta [sic]  took\n\nplace, that would be fresh pasta.  But once a drying process\n\ntakes  place, it's becoming brittle, . . . so it's unfresh.\"\n\nAnd,  we can find nothing  in the evidence  to which Abruzzi\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\npoints that  would adequately  support a finding  that Pasta\n\nand Cheese's \"fresh\" pasta is dry and brittle.\n\n          Second, Abruzzi points to an article in a magazine\n\nthat  says that a different  firm not involved  in this case\n\nuses a  pasteurization process for its  \"fresh\" pasta, which\n\nprocess  \"in  actuality, extends  product  shelf  life to  6\n\nmonths.\"  Even were  this article admissible evidence, which\n\nit is not, see Fed. R. Evid. 802; Pallotta v. United States,\n                                                           \n\n404  F.2d 1035,  1036  (1st Cir.  1968) (newspaper  article,\n\nbeing  hearsay,  \"clearly  unusable\"   to  prove  the  facts\n\nasserted  therein); Staniewicz  v. Beecham,  Inc., 687  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n526, 529-30 (1st  Cir. 1982) (requiring an  exception to the\n\nhearsay  rule   to  be  shown  before   a  magazine  article\n\ndiscussing  corporate commercial policy  could be admitted);\n\nDaniel  E.  Feld,  Annotation,  Admissibility  of  Newspaper\n                                                            \n\nArticle  as  Evidence of  the  Truth  of  the  Facts  Stated\n                                                            \n\nTherein,  55 A.L.R.3d  663 (1974),  it is  only tangentially\n       \n\nrelevant to the consumer deception issue.\n\n          Taking   all   Abruzzi's  evidence   together,  we\n\nconclude that  it would not support  factfindings that could\n\nbring this case  within the  scope of ch.  93A's legal  term\n\n\"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"  Nor do we see how,\n\ngiven this conclusion, a court could find in Abruzzi's favor\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\non  either of  two  other claims  that  it made,  one  under\n\nMassachusetts common law and  the other under  Massachusetts\n\nantitrust law, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93.  (Indeed, in respect to\n\nthis last point, Abruzzi makes no contrary argument.) \n\n          For these reasons,  the judgment  of the  district\n\ncourt is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n",

See id.  at 2406,    335\n                                           \n\n(\"because of the diversity of products in the extended shelf\n\nlife  category  [expressly   including  \"pasta   products\"],\n\n[freshness standards]  for  such products  [are]  not  being\n\naddressed in this  rule\").  Thus,  Abruzzi cannot appeal  to\n\nthe FDA rules for support.\n\n          All this means that  Abruzzi must rely upon record\n                                                            \n\nevidence.  And, Abruzzi does not do well in that department.\n        \n\nIt points to  two items.   First, its  president, Mr.  Mario\n\nBoccabella,  stated in  a  deposition that  \"pasteurization\"\n\namounts  to \"precook[ing]  a  product,\" which  is \"going  to\n\nchange  the  texture  and  the freshness  category  of  that\n\nproduct tremendously,\"  to  the  point  where  \"[y]ou're  no\n\nlonger  dealing with a fresh  product.\"  Other statements by\n\nMr. Boccabella, however, make clear  that he believed it  is\n\nthe drying of the pasta  that makes it \"unfresh.\"  He  said,\n          \n\nfor  example,  that \"before  that  drying  pasta [sic]  took\n\nplace, that would be fresh pasta.  But once a drying process\n\ntakes  place, it's becoming brittle, . . . so it's unfresh.\"\n\nAnd,  we can find nothing  in the evidence  to which Abruzzi\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\npoints that  would adequately  support a finding  that Pasta\n\nand Cheese's \"fresh\" pasta is dry and brittle.\n\n          Second, Abruzzi points to an article in a magazine\n\nthat  says that a different  firm not involved  in this case\n\nuses a  pasteurization process for its  \"fresh\" pasta, which\n\nprocess  \"in  actuality, extends  product  shelf  life to  6\n\nmonths.\"  Even were  this article admissible evidence, which\n\nit is not, see Fed. R. Evid. 802; Pallotta v.
