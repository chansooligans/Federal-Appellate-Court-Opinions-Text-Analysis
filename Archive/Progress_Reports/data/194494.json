Brieger,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.  \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.   Appellant George  Moran and two\n                          \n\nco-defendants  were convicted by a jury, after a joint trial,\n\nof  various  drug  offenses.    Moran  was  found  guilty  of\n\nconspiring  to distribute  cocaine and  was acquitted  on two\n\nother counts charging him with specific acts of distribution.\n\nAll of  the defendants have  appealed, but  the evidence  and\n\nissues  relating to  Moran differ  from those  concerning the\n\nother  defendants  and   we  decide   his  case   separately.\n\nConcluding  that  the  evidence  was  sufficient  to  sustain\n\nMoran's  conviction  for  conspiracy  and  finding  no  other\n\nerrors, we affirm.\n\n     The  procedural  history  can  be briefly  stated.    On\n\nAugust 9, 1990, Moran  and a number  of others were  indicted\n\nunder 21  U.S.C.   846  for conspiring to  distribute cocaine\n\nand,  in  other  counts pertaining  to  one  or  more of  the\n\ndefendants, with  distribution and  related crimes.   The co-\n\nconspirators   charged  in  the   umbrella  conspiracy  count\n\nincluded Moran,  the alleged  ringleader  Hobart Willis,  and\n\nothers.    Before  trial,  Willis and  three  others  pleaded\n\nguilty.   Moran  and  two  other  defendants  were  tried  in\n\nFebruary  1991 and  convicted on  one or  more counts.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Moran's central  argument on  appeal is the  often made,\n\nbut rarely successful, claim that the evidence was inadequate\n\n                             -2-\n\nto  support the verdict against  him.  In  appraising such an\n\nargument, we  \"assess the  sufficiency of the  evidence as  a\n\nwhole, including all reasonable inferences, in the light most\n\nfavorable to  the verdict . .  . .\"  United  States v. Lopez,\n                                                            \n\n944 F.2d  33, 39 (1st Cir. 1991).  So viewed, we ask \"whether\n\na  rational trier  of  fact could  have  found the  defendant\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable  doubt.\"  Id.  In  general, issues\n                                       \n\nof credibility are  resolved in  favor of the  verdict.   Id.\n                                                            \n\n\"The  evidence   .  . .  need  not exclude  every  reasonable\n\nhypothesis of  innocence; that is, the  factfinder may decide\n\namong reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"  Id.\n                                                      \n\n     In  this  case Moran  was  tried  on the  charge,  among\n\nothers, that he conspired  with Willis and his co-defendants.\n\nThe  \"essence\" of  conspiracy  is an  agreement  to commit  a\n                                               \n\ncrime, Ianelli v. United  States, 420 U. S. 770,  777 (1975),\n                                \n\nhere,  an agreement  between Moran  and others  to distribute\n\ndrugs.   Such an agreement  may, of course,  be inferred from\n\nother evidence  including a course of conduct.  United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Concemi, 957  F.2d 942,  950 (1st Cir.  1992).  More  than\n          \n\nthat,  while  the term  \"agreement\"  is  customarily used  in\n\ndefining  conspiracy   and  is  properly  employed   in  jury\n\ninstructions, the agreement of  the defendant with others may\n\nbe  implicit in  a working  relationship between  the parties\n\nthat has never been articulated but nevertheless amounts to a\n\njoint criminal enterprise.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     In this case, taking the evidence  most favorably to the\n\ngovernment, the jury could  have found from direct testimony,\n\ntelephone  recordings  and  other  evidence  that  Willis was\n\nengaged  in  a  drug  distribution  conspiracy  with  various\n\npersons during 1988.   As to Moran, the evidence  against him\n\ncame almost  entirely from one Paul  Callahan, who cooperated\n\nto  some extent  with  the  Drug Enforcement  Administration.\n\nCallahan's  trial  testimony  came  freighted with  his  long\n\ncriminal record, admissions that he procured  false testimony\n\nin  other  proceedings,  and   his  incentive  to  favor  the\n\ngovernment   in  order  to  secure  favorable  treatment  for\n\nhimself.  Nevertheless, his testimony was not incredible, was\n\ncorroborated on  certain limited points, and  was essentially\n\nuncontradicted.  Thus the jury was entitled to accept some or\n\nall of Callahan's testimony.  \n\n     According to Callahan,  he first met  Moran in 1981  but\n\nhad no further contact with him until  June or July 1988 when\n\nhe had a friend give Moran his beeper number.  Callahan  then\n\nmet  with Moran and sought to purchase  cocaine from him in a\n\nsubstantial  amount.  Moran replied that he would contact the\n\n\"fat man\"  (understood by  Callahan to  be Willis)  with whom\n\nMoran  said he  was  dealing  at the  time.    At their  next\n\nmeeting, Moran told  Callahan that the fat  man's prices were\n\ntoo high  but that Moran had another source in the North End.\n\nMoran also said  that he was  going to try  to get a  cheaper\n\n                             -4-\n\nprice from \"Mary,\" a  friend of the fat man  later identified\n\nby Callahan  as  a member  of  Willis' ring.    Subsequently,\n\nCallahan and Moran met again and Callahan purchased 500 grams\n\nof cocaine from Moran, after testing it for purity.\n\n     Some  weeks  later,  Callahan again  contacted  Moran, a\n\nfurther   meeting  ensued,   and   Moran  told   Callahan--in\n\nCallahan's words--that  he (Moran)  was \"still looking  in to\n\ningratiate with the  fat guy.\"   At the  next meeting,  Moran\n\noffered  a package of what Callahan took to be cocaine; Moran\n\nexplained that it came from the fat guy.  The  contents had a\n\ndiesel  smell and Callahan rejected the package on the ground\n\nthat  his own customers would not  accept it.  Moran left and\n\nthen returned several hours later with a kilo of cocaine from\n\nan unidentified source.  Callahan  tested the new package and\n\npurchased a half kilo.\n\n     The  final evidence relating  directly to Moran involved\n\ntwo telephone calls between him and Callahan in October 1988.\n\nThe first call was not tape recorded.  According to Callahan,\n\nMoran  complained during  the call  that federal  agents were\n\nscrutinizing  him.   On cross-examination  Callahan indicated\n\nthat  Moran also said during  the call, \"I  saw the Pillsbury\n\nBoy  a few  days ago, but  that was  just to  say hi. . . . I\n\ndon't have nothing to do with those guys.\"  Callahan told the\n\njury that the Pillsbury Boy was Willis.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     The second  conversation occurred  a week later,  it was\n\ntape  recorded with  DEA  assistance, and  the recording  was\n\noffered at trial.   In this conversation  Moran, referring to\n\nhis  prior questioning  by federal agents,  said that  it had\n\noccurred  because the agents had seen him with \"fatso\" two or\n\nthree times.  Callahan said he had heard that the fat guy was\n\nbeing  scrutinized  by  law   enforcement  agents  and  Moran\n\nreplied, \"Oh, my God.   Unbelievable.  I already told him and\n\nhis  first lieutenant,  I  says, I  think  somebody made  you\n\nexpendable.\"     At  trial  Callahan   identified  the  first\n\nlieutenant   as   Mary.     Callahan   concluded  the   taped\n\nconversation by asking Moran, \"Can  we do some business?\" and\n\nMoran  essentially agreed  (although no  evidence of  further\n\ntransactions between them was offered).\n\n     This, omitting  a few intervening  conversations between\n\nMoran and Callahan that add nothing pertinent, is the gist of\n\nthe  evidence against Moran.   The  jury, after  hearing this\n\nevidence and evidence of Willis' ring, acquitted Moran of the\n\ntwo distribution counts  based on the  sales to Callahan  but\n\nconvicted  him of conspiracy.  The reason for the discrepancy\n\nis  unclear.  Possibly the jury hesitated to rely solely upon\n\nCallahan to prove the sales, but thought that the tape of the\n\nsecond  conversation  confirmed  Moran's   relationship  with\n\nWillis regarding drug distribution.  But the discrepancy does\n\nnot matter.   The question presented  now is whether,  having\n\n                             -6-\n\nheard the evidence, including  nuances and intimations that a\n\ncold record cannot capture, a rational jury could find beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Moran was guilty of conspiracy.\n\n     No court lightly overturns a jury verdict on the  ground\n\nthat  the jury  lacked  sufficient evidence,  for the  jury's\n\ncentral role and competence is to weigh the evidence and find\n\nthe facts.   Yet the issue  here, or at  least the aspect  we\n\nfind troubling, actually  poses the \"legal\" question  whether\n\nthe conduct  the jury  could reasonably  have  found to  have\n\noccurred amounts to a  conspiracy under the statute.   In our\n\nview, the  jury here had  no rational  basis to infer,  as it\n\noften  may  in  conspiracy  cases,  that  the  defendant  was\n\neffectively an employee  or a formal  \"share partner\" in  the\n\nring.   The  most  that the  jury  could find  without  sheer\n\nspeculation was that the  relationship was what was portrayed\n\non the  surface.  At this  point we are driven  back to first\n\nprinciples to determine whether this relationship amounted to\n\na criminal conspiracy.\n\n     Our starting point is the legal definition of conspiracy\n\nas an  agreement  by the  defendant  with another  person  or\n\npersons to commit the  crime in question.  Ianelli,  420 U.S.\n                                                  \n\nat 777; United  States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855,  857 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1987).   The evidence in  this case, taken  most favorably to\n\nthe government,  shows that Willis  agreed to supply  Moran a\n\npackage which  Moran represented  to be cocaine,  which Moran\n\n                             -7-\n\ntendered  to Callahan,  and which  Callahan then  rejected as\n\ntainted with a  diesel smell.  This connection  between Moran\n\nand Willis is bolstered, or so  the jury could have found, by\n\nMoran's prior use of Willis as a source of supply, by Moran's\n\nunsuccessful  initial effort  to  buy drugs  from Willis  for\n\nCallahan,  by  Moran's  desire  to  ingratiate  himself  with\n\nWillis, by  Moran's encounters  with Willis  and Mary and  by\n\nMoran's knowledge that Willis was under federal scrutiny.  On\n\nappeal,  the  government  argues  that  the  evidence  surely\n\ndemonstrates a conspiracy either  as charged (with Willis and\n\nothers) or, at the very least, between Moran and Willis.\n\n     An  agreement surely  existed between  Willis  and Moran\n\nrelating  to drugs.    But if  the  evidence showed  only  an\n\nagreement  by Willis  to sell  drugs to  Moran, it  would not\n\nnecessarily  show  them   to  be   co-conspirators  in   drug\n\ndistribution.   There is substantial law,  including cases in\n\nthis circuit, that a single drug sale  does not automatically\n\nmake  buyer and  seller  co-conspirators.   United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nDeLutis,  722  F.2d  902,  906 (1st  Cir.  1983)  (collecting\n       \n\ncases). This  \"rule\" in  varying forms prevails  or has  been\n\nintermittently adopted in a number of circuits, including the\n\nSecond,  Fifth,  Sixth, Seventh  and  Eighth.   E.g.,  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Douglas, 818 F.2d  1317, 1321 (7th  Cir. 1987) (\"a\n                  \n\nmere    buyer-seller    relationship,   without    more,   is\n\ninadequate\").  \n\n                             -8-\n\n     Surprisingly  the reason for excluding such buyer-seller\n\ncases  from the definition of conspiracy is not wholly clear,\n\nand some explanation  is needed since even  an unplanned sale\n\ninvolves  an  agreement  between  seller and  buyer  and  the\n\noffense  of drug distribution (at least by the seller).  Some\n\nhave thought  it to follow  from the so-called  Wharton rule,\n\nnow much reduced in  force by Iannelli v. United  States, 420\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 770 (1975), that a  crime legally requiring a  plurality\n\nof actors (e.g., dueling) should not have a conspiracy charge\n              \n\nsuperimposed upon it.   Other courts have felt that  a single\n\npurchase   and  sale  do   not  involve  the   union  of  two\n                                                    \n\nparticipants in a manner that increases either the likelihood\n\nthat the individual crime  will be committed or that  the two\n\nwill extend their joint  endeavor to new crimes.   The latter\n\nexplanation has force in  the case of an unplanned  spot sale\n\nwith no agreement beyond that inherent in the sale.  It makes\n\nless sense  where the agreement is to make a sale at a future\n\npoint, an  agreement that  does increase the  likelihood that\n\nthe crime will be  committed.  Yet even  in the latter  case,\n\nthe  transaction  may seem  to some  to  lack the  quality of\n\njointness--the  hallmark  of  conspiracy--in the  sense  that\n\nseller  and   buyer  are  not  part  of   the  same  criminal\n\nenterprise.    \n\n     This may  seem a fine point  but it is one  that goes to\n\nthe  root  of conspiracy  law:   conspiracy  is treated  as a\n\n                             -9-\n\nseparate crime because of  the jointness of the endeavor.   A\n                      \n\nmultiplicity of actors united to accomplish the same crime is\n\ndeemed to present a  special set of dangers, either  that the\n\ncriminal end will be achieved, Callanan v. United States, 364\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  587, 593 (1961), or that the conspiracy will carry over\n\nto new crimes, United  States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S.  78, 88\n                                           \n\n(1915),  or both.   See 2 W.  LaFave &amp; A.  Scott, Substantive\n                                                             \n\nCriminal Law   6.4(c) (1986) (summarizing the rationale).  It\n            \n\nis these  dangers stemming from jointness  that justify early\n\nintervention to  stem conspiracies  even before they  rise to\n\nthe  level of attempts and to impose a separate punishment on\n\nthe conspirators  even if  they fail  to achieve  their ends.\n\nThis  special set  of dangers is  present if  two individuals\n\nagree that one  of them will sell cocaine and  the other will\n\nassist;  it is arguably not  present if one  merely sells the\n\nsame cocaine  to another  without prearrangement and  with no\n\nidea of or interest in its intended use.  In the latter case,\n\nboth may  be guilty--one  of distribution  and  the other  of\n\npossession--but  without  more  they  are  not  conspirators.\n\nGlenn, 828 F.2d at 858.\n     \n\n     At some point the relationships  converge.  A pattern of\n\nsales  for resale  between  the same  persons, together  with\n\ndetails supplying a context  for the relationship, might well\n\nsupport a  finding of  conspiracy.   Id. at 857-58.   Even  a\n                                       \n\nsingle  sale for resale, embroidered with evidence suggesting\n\n                             -10-\n\na joint undertaking between  buyer and seller, could suffice.\n\nUnited  States v. Carbone, 798  F.2d 21, 27  (1st Cir. 1986).\n                         \n\nCommon  knowledge, interdependence,  shared  purpose and  the\n\nother  ingredients of  a  conspiracy are  matters of  degree.\n\nAlmost everything in such a case depends upon the context and\n\nthe details.    The  evaluation  of the  facts  is  entrusted\n\nlargely to the jury.\n\n     In  this case, taking  a practical rather  than a formal\n\nview of the matter, we believe that the  jury was entitled to\n\nconclude that  the arrangement amounted  to a  conspiratorial\n\nagreement between  Willis and  Moran for the  distribution of\n\ndrugs.   Based  on testimony  that the  jury was  entitled to\n\ncredit, Moran  (according to  Callahan) admitted that  he was\n\ndealing with Willis, an  admission suggesting that Willis had\n\nsupplied Moran with drugs in the past.  Moran then  turned to\n\nWillis as his  first choice  of supplier in  seeking to  fill\n\nCallahan's first order.  Although Willis' price  was too high\n\nfor this  first transaction, for the  second one Moran--after\n\nexpressing  his  desire  to  bolster  his  relationship  (\"to\n\ningratiate  with the fat guy\")--again turned to Willis.  This\n\ntime Moran did  acquire from Willis a  resale sized quantity,\n\neven  though  Callahan  then  rejected the  shipment.    This\n\npicture of a continuing sale-for-resale relationship, even if\n\nWillis  was not  the  exclusive supplier,  was reinforced  by\n\nMoran's other contacts with  Willis and knowledge of his law-\n\n                             -11-\n\nenforcement jeopardy.  See United States  v. Anello, 765 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n253, 261 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 996 (1985).\n                                 \n\n     We  think  that a  realistic  appraisal  of Moran's  and\n\nWillis' relationship  would permit  a  jury to  find that  it\n\namounts  to  an  implicit   agreement  and  comprehends   the\n\ncontinuing supply by one to the other  of drugs for resale to\n\ncustomers.  See United States v. Geer, 923 F.2d 892, 895 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1991).  Even  though Moran was not  an employee nor  did\n\nWillis  and Moran formally divide the profits, in this case a\n\njury could conclude that both Willis and Moran had an ongoing\n\nstake in the success of Moran's  own sales of the drugs Moran\n\nacquired  from Willis.  See Glenn,  828 F.2d at 857-58.  From\n                                 \n\nthose sales Moran could profit directly and Willis indirectly\n\nthrough  the maintenance  of  the  drug distribution  channel\n\ncrucial for a drug  network.  See generally Direct  Sales Co.\n                                                            \n\nv.  United  States, 319  U.  S.  703, 717  (1943).   Such  an\n                  \n\narrangement,  we think, is  not only an  agreement within the\n\nordinary  conspiracy-law ambit  but  is one  that unites  two\n\nparticipants   in  seeking   to  accomplish   the   crime  of\n\ndistribution   and   involves   both  of   the   dangers   of\n                                    \n\nconspiracy--increased likelihood of  success and extension to\n\nother crimes--to which the  cases advert.  We think  that the\n\npragmatic approach  of  Direct Sales  in defining  conspiracy\n                                    \n\nforeshadows  the result  in  this case  and, given  Congress'\n\nintent  to stamp out drug  transactions, it certainly did not\n\n                             -12-\n\nmean  to  narrow the  conspiracy concept  when it  enacted 21\n\nU.S.C.   846, the statute involved in this case.\n\n     We leave  for another day  the lesser variations  on the\n\nsame  theme.    Obviously  a  single  sale  in  resale  sized\n\nquantities presents  one problem and an  advance agreement to\n\nmake a single  sale involves  another.  Where  one draws  the\n\nline is more  a matter of discerning congressional policy and\n\nintent  than  an  exercise  in logic,  and  the  case-by-case\n\napproach  is for the  present the wisest course.   As for the\n\nclassic    single    sale--for    personal    use,    without\n\nprearrangement,  and with nothing more--the precedent in this\n\ncircuit  as well  as  others treats  it  as not  involving  a\n\nconspiracy.   In such cases the jointness  element is clearly\n\nat  a minimum, if  it exists at  all.  Where  nothing more is\n\ninvolved, we reaffirm existing authority that such a  case is\n\nnot a conspiracy.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Moran's remaining arguments are less formidable than his\n\nattack  on  the sufficiency  of  the evidence.    Moran first\n\nargues  that even  if the  evidence was  adequate to  prove a\n\nconspiracy between Willis and Moran, it was not sufficient to\n\nprove Moran to be  a member of the larger  conspiracy charged\n\nin the indictment.  This  variance, he argues, prejudiced him\n\nby associating him with  more powerful and extensive evidence\n\n                             -13-\n\nagainst other defendants.  We agree that there was probably a\n\nvariance but find that it was not prejudicial.\n\n     The  indictment  charged   a  single  drug  distribution\n\nconspiracy,  naming as  co-conspirators  Willis,  Moran,  six\n\nother  named defendants,  and \"other  persons both  known and\n\nunknown  to the  Grand Jury  . . .  \"   At trial  much of the\n\nevidence related to  the two other defendants who pleaded not\n\nguilty and to Willis and his relations  with defendants other\n\nthan  Moran.   The references  of Mary  to one  side, nothing\n\nlinked  Moran to any of the ring members other than Willis or\n\nany of  the transactions charged elsewhere  in the indictment\n\nother than Moran's own sales to Callahan. \n\n     On this record, it is true that the evidence pointing to\n\na Willis-Moran  conspiracy is  far stronger than  evidence of\n\nconspiracy between  Moran and the Willis ring  as a whole.  A\n\nvery  serious problem would be presented if the jury had held\n\nMoran liable  for other  substantive crimes committed  by the\n\nring.  Compare Glenn.   The situation is different  where the\n                    \n\ngovernment charges a defendant with a crime (here, conspiracy\n\nto  distribute) but the  facts proven at  trial vary somewhat\n\nfrom  those charged in the  indictment.  In  that case, it is\n\nsettled law that a  conviction for the crime charged  will be\n\naffirmed unless the variance as to the facts is shown to have\n\nprejudiced the defendant.  Berger v. United States,  295 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n78  (1935);  Fed. R.  Crim  P.  52(a)(variance not  affecting\n\n                             -14-\n\nsubstantial  rights  may be  disregarded).    Convictions are\n\noften sustained  under  this principle  where the  indictment\n\nalleges  a single  conspiracy  but multiple  conspiracies are\n\nactually  proved.    E.g., United  States v.  Sutherland, 929\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 765, 772 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 83 (1991).\n                                      \n\n     In  this case, Moran does  not and could  not claim that\n\nthe variance deprived him of notice of the charge adequate to\n\nprepare  a defense.  Rather he contends that the disparity in\n\nevidence--specifically,  the  array  of  witnesses  and  tape\n\nrecordings   incriminating    other   defendants--created   a\n\n\"spillover\"  effect that  enhanced the narrower  case against\n\nhim.   See Sutherland, 929 F.2d  at 772.  The enhancement may\n                     \n\nbe  assumed;  motions for  severance  are  routinely made  in\n\nconspiracy cases, partly to escape  this taint.  The question\n\nis whether  the impact threatened  to deprive defendant  of a\n\nfair trial.  We conclude that it did not.\n\n     Most  of the  evidence  concerning Moran  was distinctly\n\ndifferent from  the evidence against others.  It derived from\n\nCallahan's  testimony and  concerned  his  transactions  with\n\nMoran.  Similarly, Moran's relationship with Willis was based\n\nupon Callahan's  description buttressed  by Moran's  own tape\n\nrecorded statements.   The distinct  separation between  this\n\nevidence  and  evidence  of  other  Willis-related activities\n\ndiminished  the risk  of  jury confusion.   Indeed,  on these\n\nfacts the risk appears  to have been minimal compared  to the\n\n                             -15-\n\nusual mass conspiracy case.  Under  these circumstances we do\n\nnot think  the  apparent variance  even  arguably  threatened\n\nMoran's right to a fair trial.\n\n     Finally,  Moran   argues  that   error   inheres  in   a\n\nsupplementary  instruction  given  to  the  jury  during  its\n\ndeliberations.   Jury  deliberations  began  on February  14,\n\n1991, and the next day the jury sent in the following written\n\nquestion, as described by the trial judge:\n\n             The  indictment  states, quote,  David\n          Elwell,   Richard  Morretto   and  George\n          Moran,  defendants,  combined,  conspired\n          and agreed with  each other -- underlined\n          \"with  each  other\"  --  and  with  other\n          persons,  both known  and unknown  to the\n          grand  jury,  close   quote.    Does  the\n          statement   mean   these  three   --  and\n          circled --  people  conspired  with  each\n          other --  and \"with each  other\" is again\n          underlined.  Your instruction seems to be\n          different from the indictment.  Signed by\n          the foreperson.\n\nThe judge  then re-instructed  the jury, reminding  them that\n\n\"first,  remember  the indictment  is  only  the charge,  the\n\naccusation.   It is not evidence.   It is not  a statement of\n\nthe law.  On  the other hand, my instructions are a statement\n\nof the  law and are binding on you.\"  The judge then repeated\n\nhis prior  instructions on  conspiracy (two or  more persons,\n\nagreement to commit  crime charged, defendant's knowledge  of\n\nunlawful purpose and knowing joinder).   Within the hour, the\n\njury   returned  its   verdict,   including  the   conspiracy\n\nconviction of Moran.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     On appeal, Moran agrees that \"[v]iewed in isolation, the\n\njudge's  instructions  were  unobjectionable,\"  and  this  is\n\nclearly so:  the response to  the jury's question  was clear,\n\ncorrect, and  precisely answered  the question posed.   Moran\n\nargues, however,  that in context the  instruction could have\n\nled  the  jury  to  believe  that  it  could   disregard  the\n\nindictment  entirely   and  convict  the  defendant   of  any\n\nconspiracy it chose.  There  is a distinct possibility,  says\n\nMoran,  that  the  jury convicted  him  of  a  conspiracy not\n\ncharged such as a  conspiracy with Callahan or  \"a conspiracy\n\nwith Willis, different  from that involving  Moretto, Polito,\n\nand Elwell.\"\n\n     Moran's  counsel   at  trial  did  not   object  to  the\n\nsupplementary  instruction  and  any  objection  is therefore\n\nwaived absent a showing of serious prejudice.   United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 525 (1st Cir. 1991).  No such showing\n        \n\nhas  been  made here.    Further, we  do not  think  that the\n\ninstruction invited the jury  to disregard the charge in  the\n\nindictment;  indeed,  the supplementary  instruction reminded\n\nthe jury that the agreement here charged was \"to possess with\n\nintent to  distribute cocaine.\"   As for the  suggestion that\n\nthe jury  convicted Moran for such a  conspiracy with Willis,\n\nrather than with Willis and others in his ring, this may well\n\nbe so.  But as cases like Sutherland show, such an outcome is\n                                    \n\n                             -17-\n\nnot conviction for a \"different crime\"  than that charged but\n\nis merely a permissible variance.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -18-\n",

Appellant George  Moran and two\n                          \n\nco-defendants  were convicted by a jury, after a joint trial,\n\nof  various  drug  offenses.    Moran  was  found  guilty  of\n\nconspiring  to distribute  cocaine and  was acquitted  on two\n\nother counts charging him with specific acts of distribution.\n\nAll of  the defendants have  appealed, but  the evidence  and\n\nissues  relating to  Moran differ  from those  concerning the\n\nother  defendants  and   we  decide   his  case   separately.\n\nConcluding  that  the  evidence  was  sufficient  to  sustain\n\nMoran's  conviction  for  conspiracy  and  finding  no  other\n\nerrors, we affirm.\n\n     The  procedural  history  can  be briefly  stated.    On\n\nAugust 9, 1990, Moran  and a number  of others were  indicted\n\nunder 21  U.S.C.   846  for conspiring to  distribute cocaine\n\nand,  in  other  counts pertaining  to  one  or  more of  the\n\ndefendants, with  distribution and  related crimes.   The co-\n\nconspirators   charged  in  the   umbrella  conspiracy  count\n\nincluded Moran,  the alleged  ringleader  Hobart Willis,  and\n\nothers.    Before  trial,  Willis and  three  others  pleaded\n\nguilty.   Moran  and  two  other  defendants  were  tried  in\n\nFebruary  1991 and  convicted on  one or  more counts.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Moran's central  argument on  appeal is the  often made,\n\nbut rarely successful, claim that the evidence was inadequate\n\n                             -2-\n\nto  support the verdict against  him.  In  appraising such an\n\nargument, we  \"assess the  sufficiency of the  evidence as  a\n\nwhole, including all reasonable inferences, in the light most\n\nfavorable to  the verdict . .  . .\"  United  States v.

Such an agreement  may, of course,  be inferred from\n\nother evidence  including a course of conduct.  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

More  than\n          \n\nthat,  while  the term  \"agreement\"  is  customarily used  in\n\ndefining  conspiracy   and  is  properly  employed   in  jury\n\ninstructions, the agreement of  the defendant with others may\n\nbe  implicit in  a working  relationship between  the parties\n\nthat has never been articulated but nevertheless amounts to a\n\njoint criminal enterprise.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     In this case, taking the evidence  most favorably to the\n\ngovernment, the jury could  have found from direct testimony,\n\ntelephone  recordings  and  other  evidence  that  Willis was\n\nengaged  in  a  drug  distribution  conspiracy  with  various\n\npersons during 1988.   As to Moran, the evidence  against him\n\ncame almost  entirely from one Paul  Callahan, who cooperated\n\nto  some extent  with  the  Drug Enforcement  Administration.\n\nCallahan's  trial  testimony  came  freighted with  his  long\n\ncriminal record, admissions that he procured  false testimony\n\nin  other  proceedings,  and   his  incentive  to  favor  the\n\ngovernment   in  order  to  secure  favorable  treatment  for\n\nhimself.  Nevertheless, his testimony was not incredible, was\n\ncorroborated on  certain limited points, and  was essentially\n\nuncontradicted.  Thus the jury was entitled to accept some or\n\nall of Callahan's testimony.  \n\n     According to Callahan,  he first met  Moran in 1981  but\n\nhad no further contact with him until  June or July 1988 when\n\nhe had a friend give Moran his beeper number.  Callahan  then\n\nmet  with Moran and sought to purchase  cocaine from him in a\n\nsubstantial  amount.  Moran replied that he would contact the\n\n\"fat man\"  (understood by  Callahan to  be Willis)  with whom\n\nMoran  said he  was  dealing  at the  time.    At their  next\n\nmeeting, Moran told  Callahan that the fat  man's prices were\n\ntoo high  but that Moran had another source in the North End.\n\nMoran also said  that he was  going to try  to get a  cheaper\n\n                             -4-\n\nprice from \"Mary,\" a  friend of the fat man  later identified\n\nby Callahan  as  a member  of  Willis' ring.    Subsequently,\n\nCallahan and Moran met again and Callahan purchased 500 grams\n\nof cocaine from Moran, after testing it for purity.\n\n     Some  weeks  later,  Callahan again  contacted  Moran, a\n\nfurther   meeting  ensued,   and   Moran  told   Callahan--in\n\nCallahan's words--that  he (Moran)  was \"still looking  in to\n\ningratiate with the  fat guy.\"   At the  next meeting,  Moran\n\noffered  a package of what Callahan took to be cocaine; Moran\n\nexplained that it came from the fat guy.  The  contents had a\n\ndiesel  smell and Callahan rejected the package on the ground\n\nthat  his own customers would not  accept it.  Moran left and\n\nthen returned several hours later with a kilo of cocaine from\n\nan unidentified source.  Callahan  tested the new package and\n\npurchased a half kilo.\n\n     The  final evidence relating  directly to Moran involved\n\ntwo telephone calls between him and Callahan in October 1988.\n\nThe first call was not tape recorded.  According to Callahan,\n\nMoran  complained during  the call  that federal  agents were\n\nscrutinizing  him.   On cross-examination  Callahan indicated\n\nthat  Moran also said during  the call, \"I  saw the Pillsbury\n\nBoy  a few  days ago, but  that was  just to  say hi. . . . I\n\ndon't have nothing to do with those guys.\"  Callahan told the\n\njury that the Pillsbury Boy was Willis.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     The second  conversation occurred  a week later,  it was\n\ntape  recorded with  DEA  assistance, and  the recording  was\n\noffered at trial.   In this conversation  Moran, referring to\n\nhis  prior questioning  by federal agents,  said that  it had\n\noccurred  because the agents had seen him with \"fatso\" two or\n\nthree times.  Callahan said he had heard that the fat guy was\n\nbeing  scrutinized  by  law   enforcement  agents  and  Moran\n\nreplied, \"Oh, my God.   Unbelievable.  I already told him and\n\nhis  first lieutenant,  I  says, I  think  somebody made  you\n\nexpendable.\"     At  trial  Callahan   identified  the  first\n\nlieutenant   as   Mary.     Callahan   concluded  the   taped\n\nconversation by asking Moran, \"Can  we do some business?\" and\n\nMoran  essentially agreed  (although no  evidence of  further\n\ntransactions between them was offered).\n\n     This, omitting  a few intervening  conversations between\n\nMoran and Callahan that add nothing pertinent, is the gist of\n\nthe  evidence against Moran.   The  jury, after  hearing this\n\nevidence and evidence of Willis' ring, acquitted Moran of the\n\ntwo distribution counts  based on the  sales to Callahan  but\n\nconvicted  him of conspiracy.  The reason for the discrepancy\n\nis  unclear.  Possibly the jury hesitated to rely solely upon\n\nCallahan to prove the sales, but thought that the tape of the\n\nsecond  conversation  confirmed  Moran's   relationship  with\n\nWillis regarding drug distribution.  But the discrepancy does\n\nnot matter.   The question presented  now is whether,  having\n\n                             -6-\n\nheard the evidence, including  nuances and intimations that a\n\ncold record cannot capture, a rational jury could find beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Moran was guilty of conspiracy.\n\n     No court lightly overturns a jury verdict on the  ground\n\nthat  the jury  lacked  sufficient evidence,  for the  jury's\n\ncentral role and competence is to weigh the evidence and find\n\nthe facts.   Yet the issue  here, or at  least the aspect  we\n\nfind troubling, actually  poses the \"legal\" question  whether\n\nthe conduct  the jury  could reasonably  have  found to  have\n\noccurred amounts to a  conspiracy under the statute.   In our\n\nview, the  jury here had  no rational  basis to infer,  as it\n\noften  may  in  conspiracy  cases,  that  the  defendant  was\n\neffectively an employee  or a formal  \"share partner\" in  the\n\nring.   The  most  that the  jury  could find  without  sheer\n\nspeculation was that the  relationship was what was portrayed\n\non the  surface.  At this  point we are driven  back to first\n\nprinciples to determine whether this relationship amounted to\n\na criminal conspiracy.\n\n     Our starting point is the legal definition of conspiracy\n\nas an  agreement  by the  defendant  with another  person  or\n\npersons to commit the  crime in question.

The evidence in  this case, taken  most favorably to\n\nthe government,  shows that Willis  agreed to supply  Moran a\n\npackage which  Moran represented  to be cocaine,  which Moran\n\n                             -7-\n\ntendered  to Callahan,  and which  Callahan then  rejected as\n\ntainted with a  diesel smell.  This connection  between Moran\n\nand Willis is bolstered, or so  the jury could have found, by\n\nMoran's prior use of Willis as a source of supply, by Moran's\n\nunsuccessful  initial effort  to  buy drugs  from Willis  for\n\nCallahan,  by  Moran's  desire  to  ingratiate  himself  with\n\nWillis, by  Moran's encounters  with Willis  and Mary and  by\n\nMoran's knowledge that Willis was under federal scrutiny.  On\n\nappeal,  the  government  argues  that  the  evidence  surely\n\ndemonstrates a conspiracy either  as charged (with Willis and\n\nothers) or, at the very least, between Moran and Willis.\n\n     An  agreement surely  existed between  Willis  and Moran\n\nrelating  to drugs.    But if  the  evidence showed  only  an\n\nagreement  by Willis  to sell  drugs to  Moran, it  would not\n\nnecessarily  show  them   to  be   co-conspirators  in   drug\n\ndistribution.

The  evaluation  of the  facts  is  entrusted\n\nlargely to the jury.\n\n     In  this case, taking  a practical rather  than a formal\n\nview of the matter, we believe that the  jury was entitled to\n\nconclude that  the arrangement amounted  to a  conspiratorial\n\nagreement between  Willis and  Moran for the  distribution of\n\ndrugs.   Based  on testimony  that the  jury was  entitled to\n\ncredit, Moran  (according to  Callahan) admitted that  he was\n\ndealing with Willis, an  admission suggesting that Willis had\n\nsupplied Moran with drugs in the past.  Moran then  turned to\n\nWillis as his  first choice  of supplier in  seeking to  fill\n\nCallahan's first order.  Although Willis' price  was too high\n\nfor this  first transaction, for the  second one Moran--after\n\nexpressing  his  desire  to  bolster  his  relationship  (\"to\n\ningratiate  with the fat guy\")--again turned to Willis.  This\n\ntime Moran did  acquire from Willis a  resale sized quantity,\n\neven  though  Callahan  then  rejected the  shipment.    This\n\npicture of a continuing sale-for-resale relationship, even if\n\nWillis  was not  the  exclusive supplier,  was reinforced  by\n\nMoran's other contacts with  Willis and knowledge of his law-\n\n                             -11-\n\nenforcement jeopardy.

Even  though Moran was not  an employee nor  did\n\nWillis  and Moran formally divide the profits, in this case a\n\njury could conclude that both Willis and Moran had an ongoing\n\nstake in the success of Moran's  own sales of the drugs Moran\n\nacquired  from Willis.  See Glenn,  828 F.2d at 857-58.  From\n                                 \n\nthose sales Moran could profit directly and Willis indirectly\n\nthrough  the maintenance  of  the  drug distribution  channel\n\ncrucial for a drug  network.  See generally Direct  Sales Co.\n                                                            \n\nv.  United  States, 319  U.  S.  703, 717  (1943).   Such  an\n                  \n\narrangement,  we think, is  not only an  agreement within the\n\nordinary  conspiracy-law ambit  but  is one  that unites  two\n\nparticipants   in  seeking   to  accomplish   the   crime  of\n\ndistribution   and   involves   both  of   the   dangers   of\n                                    \n\nconspiracy--increased likelihood of  success and extension to\n\nother crimes--to which the  cases advert.  We think  that the\n\npragmatic approach  of  Direct Sales  in defining  conspiracy\n                                    \n\nforeshadows  the result  in  this case  and, given  Congress'\n\nintent  to stamp out drug  transactions, it certainly did not\n\n                             -12-\n\nmean  to  narrow the  conspiracy concept  when it  enacted 21\n\nU.S.C.   846, the statute involved in this case.\n\n     We leave  for another day  the lesser variations  on the\n\nsame  theme.    Obviously  a  single  sale  in  resale  sized\n\nquantities presents  one problem and an  advance agreement to\n\nmake a single  sale involves  another.  Where  one draws  the\n\nline is more  a matter of discerning congressional policy and\n\nintent  than  an  exercise  in logic,  and  the  case-by-case\n\napproach  is for the  present the wisest course.   As for the\n\nclassic    single    sale--for    personal    use,    without\n\nprearrangement,  and with nothing more--the precedent in this\n\ncircuit  as well  as  others treats  it  as not  involving  a\n\nconspiracy.   In such cases the jointness  element is clearly\n\nat  a minimum, if  it exists at  all.  Where  nothing more is\n\ninvolved, we reaffirm existing authority that such a  case is\n\nnot a conspiracy.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Moran's remaining arguments are less formidable than his\n\nattack  on  the sufficiency  of  the evidence.    Moran first\n\nargues  that even  if the  evidence was  adequate to  prove a\n\nconspiracy between Willis and Moran, it was not sufficient to\n\nprove Moran to be  a member of the larger  conspiracy charged\n\nin the indictment.  This  variance, he argues, prejudiced him\n\nby associating him with  more powerful and extensive evidence\n\n                             -13-\n\nagainst other defendants.  We agree that there was probably a\n\nvariance but find that it was not prejudicial.\n\n     The  indictment  charged   a  single  drug  distribution\n\nconspiracy,  naming as  co-conspirators  Willis,  Moran,  six\n\nother  named defendants,  and \"other  persons both  known and\n\nunknown  to the  Grand Jury  . . .  \"   At trial  much of the\n\nevidence related to  the two other defendants who pleaded not\n\nguilty and to Willis and his relations  with defendants other\n\nthan  Moran.   The references  of Mary  to one  side, nothing\n\nlinked  Moran to any of the ring members other than Willis or\n\nany of  the transactions charged elsewhere  in the indictment\n\nother than Moran's own sales to Callahan. \n\n     On this record, it is true that the evidence pointing to\n\na Willis-Moran  conspiracy is  far stronger than  evidence of\n\nconspiracy between  Moran and the Willis ring  as a whole.  A\n\nvery  serious problem would be presented if the jury had held\n\nMoran liable  for other  substantive crimes committed  by the\n\nring.  Compare Glenn.   The situation is different  where the\n                    \n\ngovernment charges a defendant with a crime (here, conspiracy\n\nto  distribute) but the  facts proven at  trial vary somewhat\n\nfrom  those charged in the  indictment.  In  that case, it is\n\nsettled law that a  conviction for the crime charged  will be\n\naffirmed unless the variance as to the facts is shown to have\n\nprejudiced the defendant.  Berger v.

Rather he contends that the disparity in\n\nevidence--specifically,  the  array  of  witnesses  and  tape\n\nrecordings   incriminating    other   defendants--created   a\n\n\"spillover\"  effect that  enhanced the narrower  case against\n\nhim.   See Sutherland, 929 F.2d  at 772.  The enhancement may\n                     \n\nbe  assumed;  motions for  severance  are  routinely made  in\n\nconspiracy cases, partly to escape  this taint.  The question\n\nis whether  the impact threatened  to deprive defendant  of a\n\nfair trial.  We conclude that it did not.\n\n     Most  of the  evidence  concerning Moran  was distinctly\n\ndifferent from  the evidence against others.  It derived from\n\nCallahan's  testimony and  concerned  his  transactions  with\n\nMoran.  Similarly, Moran's relationship with Willis was based\n\nupon Callahan's  description buttressed  by Moran's  own tape\n\nrecorded statements.   The distinct  separation between  this\n\nevidence  and  evidence  of  other  Willis-related activities\n\ndiminished  the risk  of  jury confusion.   Indeed,  on these\n\nfacts the risk appears  to have been minimal compared  to the\n\n                             -15-\n\nusual mass conspiracy case.  Under  these circumstances we do\n\nnot think  the  apparent variance  even  arguably  threatened\n\nMoran's right to a fair trial.\n\n     Finally,  Moran   argues  that   error   inheres  in   a\n\nsupplementary  instruction  given  to  the  jury  during  its\n\ndeliberations.   Jury  deliberations  began  on February  14,\n\n1991, and the next day the jury sent in the following written\n\nquestion, as described by the trial judge:\n\n             The  indictment  states, quote,  David\n          Elwell,   Richard  Morretto   and  George\n          Moran,  defendants,  combined,  conspired\n          and agreed with  each other -- underlined\n          \"with  each  other\"  --  and  with  other\n          persons,  both known  and unknown  to the\n          grand  jury,  close   quote.    Does  the\n          statement   mean   these  three   --  and\n          circled --  people  conspired  with  each\n          other --  and \"with each  other\" is again\n          underlined.  Your instruction seems to be\n          different from the indictment.  Signed by\n          the foreperson.\n\nThe judge  then re-instructed  the jury, reminding  them that\n\n\"first,  remember  the indictment  is  only  the charge,  the\n\naccusation.   It is not evidence.   It is not  a statement of\n\nthe law.  On  the other hand, my instructions are a statement\n\nof the  law and are binding on you.\"  The judge then repeated\n\nhis prior  instructions on  conspiracy (two or  more persons,\n\nagreement to commit  crime charged, defendant's knowledge  of\n\nunlawful purpose and knowing joinder).   Within the hour, the\n\njury   returned  its   verdict,   including  the   conspiracy\n\nconviction of Moran.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     On appeal, Moran agrees that \"[v]iewed in isolation, the\n\njudge's  instructions  were  unobjectionable,\"  and  this  is\n\nclearly so:  the response to  the jury's question  was clear,\n\ncorrect, and  precisely answered  the question posed.   Moran\n\nargues, however,  that in context the  instruction could have\n\nled  the  jury  to  believe  that  it  could   disregard  the\n\nindictment  entirely   and  convict  the  defendant   of  any\n\nconspiracy it chose.  There  is a distinct possibility,  says\n\nMoran,  that  the  jury convicted  him  of  a  conspiracy not\n\ncharged such as a  conspiracy with Callahan or  \"a conspiracy\n\nwith Willis, different  from that involving  Moretto, Polito,\n\nand Elwell.\"\n\n     Moran's  counsel   at  trial  did  not   object  to  the\n\nsupplementary  instruction  and  any  objection  is therefore\n\nwaived absent a showing of serious prejudice.   United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Maraj, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (1st Cir. 1991).  No such showing\n        \n\nhas  been  made here.    Further, we  do not  think  that the\n\ninstruction invited the jury  to disregard the charge in  the\n\nindictment;  indeed,  the supplementary  instruction reminded\n\nthe jury that the agreement here charged was \"to possess with\n\nintent to  distribute cocaine.\"   As for the  suggestion that\n\nthe jury  convicted Moran for such a  conspiracy with Willis,\n\nrather than with Willis and others in his ring, this may well\n\nbe so.  But as cases like Sutherland show, such an outcome is\n                                    \n\n                             -17-\n\nnot conviction for a \"different crime\"  than that charged but\n\nis merely a permissible variance.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -18-\n</pre>",
