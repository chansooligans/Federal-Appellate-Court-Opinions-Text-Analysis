Eric  Aponte  and Elba  Garcia,  the\n                        \n\nplaintiffs in  this diversity  case, filed a  complaint in  which\n\nthey claimed that Puerto Rico  Marine Management (1) violated its\n\ncontract  with  Aponte  by  improperly dismissing  him  from  his\n\nposition   of  General   Manager,   and  (2)   in  the   process,\n\n\"intentionally  and  maliciously  misinformed  the  press\"  about\n\nevents  related to the dismissal.  The defendant pointed out that\n\nPuerto  Rico's \"Law 80\",  see P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 29,    185a et\n                                                                 \n\nseq.,  limits damages  for wrongful  dismissal to an  amount well\n    \n\nbelow the federal diversity  jurisdiction minimum of $50,000, see\n                                                                 \n\n28 U.S.C.   1332.  It moved for summary judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56, and, alternatively,  to dismiss the complaint  for failure to\n\nstate a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   The plaintiffs concede\n\nthat  the district  court correctly  granted summary  judgment in\n\nrespect to  their claim for  wrongful dismissal, but  they appeal\n\nits decision dismissing their separate libel claim.\n\n             We agree with the plaintiffs that the district  court\n\nshould  not have dismissed  the libel claim.   Our reason is that\n\nthe defendant's motion for  summary judgment, read in conjunction\n\nwith the memorandum or law which  supports it, does not appear to\n\nseek summary judgment on  that claim.  Rather, the  defendant, in\n\nthat  motion, says that it  seeks dismissal for  the reasons that\n\n(1) the \"additional damages  requested by the plaintiff[s] .  . .\n\nare not recoverable  as a matter of law;\" (2)  Puerto Rico's \"Law\n\n80\" limits wrongful  discharge damages to about $12,000;  and (3)\n\neven   assuming  attorney's   fees  were   awarded,  the   amount\n\nrecoverable  under the  complaint would  not satisfy  the $50,000\n\njurisdictional  requirement.   It assumes  that the  libel count,\n\nrather  than setting  forth  a separate  cause of  action, simply\n\nseeks extra damages for a wrongful dismissal.\n                   \n\n             It may  well be  that defendant  intended to move  to\n\ndismiss  all of the causes of action in the complaint, contending\n\nthat  both the  discharge-related libel  claims and  the wrongful\n\ndischarge claims were preempted by the exclusive remedy set forth\n\nin \"Law  80.\"   However, if  this was the  intention, it  was not\n\nclearly expressed by the defendant's motion, especially when that\n\nmotion is read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum of\n\nlaw,  which  largely limits  itself  to  discussion of  \"wrongful\n\ndischarge\"  law.   As a  consequence, we  believe  the plaintiffs\n\ncould  reasonably  have  considered the  defendant's  motion  for\n\ndismissal  or  summary  judgment to  have  referred  only  to the\n\n\"wrongful dismissal\" claim, not to the \"libel and slander\" claim.\n\nThat  being  so,  the  plaintiffs  need  not  have  responded  by\n\n\"set[ting] forth specific facts showing  there is a genuine issue\n\nfor  trial\" with  regard to  the libel  claim.   Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n56(e).  Rather,  they could simply have pointed out  to the court\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nthat the summary judgment motion and memorandum had ignored their\n\nseparate libel claim.  And, that is what the plaintiffs did. \n\n             The plaintiffs may themselves be partly to blame  for\n\nthe failure of  the defendant's  motion to refer  to their  libel\n\nclaim as a separate cause of action, distinct from their wrongful\n\ndischarge  claim.   Their  complaint says  at  the outset,  in  a\n\nseparate section entitled \"nature of the action,\" that the \n\n             nature of the action is for the recovery\n             of   contractual   damages   caused   to\n             plaintiffs  as  a result  of defendant's\n             wrongful and  discriminatory termination\n             of employment. \n\nSomeone reading these  words alone might have concluded  that the\n\nplaintiffs meant  their later  allegations of  libel to  refer to\n\ndamages caused by the wrongful dismissal, not to a separate cause\n\nof action.  Nonetheless, the plaintiffs, in a separate section VI\n\nof their complaint, do  set forth the elements of a  libel claim.\n\nThey state, for example, that the defendant \"maliciously provided\n\njournalists with . . . erroneous information [about Eric Aponte's\n\nresponsibility  for financial  irregularities]  with .  . .  full\n\nknowledge  of  its  falsity\"  or \"with  negligent  disregard  for\n\ntruth.\"   They  specify the  way in  which these  alleged actions\n\nharmed the plaintiffs.   And, most importantly,  they entitle the\n\nparagraphs of section  VI the  \"Second Cause of  Action.\"   Later\n                                                       \n\ndevelopments  in  the  case   should  have  further  alerted  the\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\ndefendant  that  the complaint  purported to  set out  a separate\n\ncause of action for libel.   In their response to the  motion for\n\nsummary judgment, plaintiffs refer to  \"their cause of action for\n\nlibel  and slander  which is  based .  . .  on acts  of defendant\n\nseparate   and   distinct\"  from   \"the  actual   termination  of\n\nemployment.\"   And,  the court's  \"initial scheduling  conference\n\norder\"  refers to the  libel and  slander action  as a  \"cause of\n\naction\"    separate  from  the   cause  of  action  for   \"unjust\n\ntermination.\"  Under these circumstances, we believe it necessary\n\nto  treat  the complaint  as setting  forth  a separate  cause of\n\naction for libel and slander.   See Fed. R. Civ. P.  8(f); Conley\n                                                                 \n\nv.

On remand, the defendant,\n\nof course, remains free  to move for summary judgment  in respect\n\nto  the libel and slander claim; in response, the plaintiffs will\n\nlikely have to particularize their factual showing.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\n             The judgment  of the  district  court dismissing  the\n\nplaintiffs'  claim for libel and slander is vacated and this case\n\nis remanded with instructions to reinstate that claim.\n\n             So ordered. \n                        \n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n",
