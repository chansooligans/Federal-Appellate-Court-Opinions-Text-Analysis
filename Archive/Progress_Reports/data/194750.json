The envelopes\n\ncontained plaintiff's request to enroll in summer classes and\n\nplaintiff's grades for the  previous semesters.  While prison\n\nregulations allowed sealed letters  to be sent to any  of ten\n\nlisted  persons or entities (e.g., president, vice-president,\n                                 \n\nfederal  or   state  courts)  --  all   other  outgoing  mail\n\npresumably had  to be sent  in unsealed  envelopes for  ready\n\ninspection --  schools and universities were  not included on\n\nthe privileged  list.1  Nevertheless,  plaintiff claimed that\n\n                    \n\n1.  According   to   plaintiff,  the   challenged  regulation\nprovided as follows:\n\n     Privileged Correspondence\n\n     1.

In any  case, it  will not  be opened\n          outside the  presence  of the  resident unless  the\n          item  has  specifically  waived this  privilege  in\n          writing.

County Attorneys per warden\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Concluding that plaintiff had  no right to send his\n\ncollege  transcripts in sealed  envelopes, a magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that  the complaint  be dismissed.   The district\n\ncourt agreed, and plaintiff has now appealed.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          The     censorship2     of    outgoing     prisoner\n\ncorrespondence \"is  justified if  the following  criteria are\n\nmet\":\n\n          First,  the  regulation  or  practice  in\n          question  must  further  an important  or\n          substantial     governmental     interest\n          unrelated    to   the    suppression   of\n          expression.    Prison  officials may  not\n          censor  inmate  correspondence simply  to\n          eliminate   unflattering   or   unwelcome\n          opinions    or    factually    inaccurate\n          statements.   Rather, they must show that\n          a regulation  authorizing mail censorship\n          furthers  one or more  of the substantial\n          governmental   interests   of   security,\n          order, and rehabilitation.   Second,  the\n          limitation  of  First Amendment  freedoms\n          must  be no greater  than is necessary or\n          essential  to  the   protection  of   the\n          particular      governmental     interest\n          involved.  Thus  a restriction on  inmate\n          correspondence that furthers an important\n          or   substantial    interest   of   penal\n          administration   will   nevertheless   be\n          invalid  if  its  sweep is  unnecessarily\n          broad.   This does  not mean,  of course,\n          that   prison   administrators   may   be\n          required  to  show  with  certainty  that\n          adverse consequences would flow  from the\n\n                    \n\n2.  We will  assume without  deciding that the  inspection of\n                                                          \nplaintiff's mail  constitutes censorship.   But see  Royse v.\n                                                          \nSuperior  Court of the State of Washington, 779 F.2d 573 (9th\n                                          \nCir.  1986)  (inspection  for  contraband  of  mail  sent  by\nprisoners to  state court does not  constitute censorship and\ndoes not violate the constitution).\n\n                             -4-\n\n          failure  to  censor a  particular letter.\n          Some   latitude   in   anticipating   the\n          probable consequences of allowing certain\n          speech   in   a  prison   environment  is\n          essential to  the proper discharge  of an\n          administrator's duty.  But any regulation\n          or   practice   that   restricts   inmate\n          correspondence    must    be    generally\n          necessary to protect one  or more of  the\n          legitimate     governmental     interests\n          identified above.\n\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 413-14 (1974).  See also\n                                                             \n\nThornburgh  v. Abbott,  490  U.S. 401,  413 (1989)  (Martinez\n                                                             \n\nstandard  applies  when  assessing the  constitutionality  of\n\nregulations    concerning   outgoing    correspondence,   but\n\nregulation of  incoming mail  is subject to  more deferential\n\nreasonableness standard).\n\n          The  challenged New Hampshire State Prison practice\n\nof requiring non-privileged outgoing mail to be submitted for\n\ninspection  in  unsealed  envelopes satisfies  both  Martinez\n                                                             \n\ncriteria.     First,  the   practice  furthers  an  important\n\ngovernmental interest -- security.  As the  Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized,   [\"p]erhaps   the   most  obvious   example   of\n\njustifiable censorship  of prisoner mail would  be refusal to\n\nsend  . .  . letters  concerning  escape plans  or containing\n\nother  information  concerning  proposed criminal  activity.\"\n\nProcunier v.  Martinez, 416  U.S.  at 413.   Plaintiff  would\n                      \n\nargue  that his  mail, directed  to a  school in  an envelope\n\nsupplied by the school, presented no security problem because\n\nescape  or criminal  activity plans  could not  fruitfully be\n\n                             -5-\n\ntransmitted  in this manner.   Plaintiff is wrong.   Were the\n\ninstitution  not a legitimate  one or were  the school's mail\n\nroom employee  in cahoots with  plaintiff, security  concerns\n\ncould well be implicated.\n\n          Plaintiff  argues  that   inspection  of   outgoing\n\ncorrespondence cannot  rationally be justified as  a security\n\nmeasure given,  plaintiff says, that prison  officials do not\n\nmonitor  prisoners'  telephone  calls  or  conversations with\n\nvisitors,  means  by which  prisoners  could  just as  easily\n\ncommunicate escape plans.   Plaintiff  cites to  a number  of\n\nolder cases  which employed  such reasoning in  striking down\n\noutgoing mail inspection practices.   We, however, rejected a\n\nsimilar argument in Feeley v. Sampson, 570 F.2d 364, 374 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1978).   There, the  district court  had reasoned  that\n\n\"because detainees' visits went unmonitored,  escape plans or\n\ncontraband  `drops'  could  be  plotted  regardless   of  any\n\nsurveillance   of   correspondence,\"   and   concluded   that\n\ninspection of  outgoing mail could therefore not be upheld on\n\nsecurity  grounds.  Id. at  374.  We  rejected that reasoning\n                       \n\nand concluded, in substance,  that unmonitored mail increased\n\nprisoners' opportunities for plotting escape and consequently\n\nsurveillance was justified as a security measure.  We  adhere\n\nto that position.\n\n          The   second   Martinez   requirement,   that   the\n                                 \n\nlimitation  be no greater than  necessary, is also  met.  The\n\n                             -6-\n\nlimitation is fairly minimal -- plaintiff can correspond with\n\nthe school provided  he allows prison officials to  check the\n\ncorrespondence  -- and  there is  no other  way to  determine\n\nwhether escape  plans or  other proscribable matter  is being\n\nsent except  by looking  at the correspondence.   Plaintiff's\n\nconstitutional rights  were not violated.   See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Whalen, 940  F.2d  1027, 1035  (7th  Cir.)

Mail\n          addressed  as  indicated  will not  be  opened  for\n          inspection  except in  the resident's  presence and\n          may be sealed before deposit in the mail collection\n          boxes.   Addresses marked with  a *, do not require\n          postage.\n\n          a.  President of the United States, Washington, DC\n\n          b.      Vice-President   of   the   United  States,\nWashington,             DC\n\n          c.  Members of Congress addressed to appropriate \n              office\n\n          d.  The Attorney General of the United States and \n              regional offices of the Attorney General\n\n          e.  Federal or State Courts*\n\n          f.  The Governor and Council of the State of New \n              Hampshire, State House, Concord, NH 03301*\n\n          g.  The Attorney General of the State of New     \n              Hampshire,  State  House  Annex,   Concord,  NH\n03301*\n\n          h.  Commissioner of the Department of Corrections*\n\n          i.  Members of the State Parole Board*\n\n          k.  County Attorneys per warden\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Concluding that plaintiff had  no right to send his\n\ncollege  transcripts in sealed  envelopes, a magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that  the complaint  be dismissed.   The district\n\ncourt agreed, and plaintiff has now appealed.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          The     censorship2     of    outgoing     prisoner\n\ncorrespondence \"is  justified if  the following  criteria are\n\nmet\":\n\n          First,  the  regulation  or  practice  in\n          question  must  further  an important  or\n          substantial     governmental     interest\n          unrelated    to   the    suppression   of\n          expression.    Prison  officials may  not\n          censor  inmate  correspondence simply  to\n          eliminate   unflattering   or   unwelcome\n          opinions    or    factually    inaccurate\n          statements.   Rather, they must show that\n          a regulation  authorizing mail censorship\n          furthers  one or more  of the substantial\n          governmental   interests   of   security,\n          order, and rehabilitation.   Second,  the\n          limitation  of  First Amendment  freedoms\n          must  be no greater  than is necessary or\n          essential  to  the   protection  of   the\n          particular      governmental     interest\n          involved.  Thus  a restriction on  inmate\n          correspondence that furthers an important\n          or   substantial    interest   of   penal\n          administration   will   nevertheless   be\n          invalid  if  its  sweep is  unnecessarily\n          broad.   This does  not mean,  of course,\n          that   prison   administrators   may   be\n          required  to  show  with  certainty  that\n          adverse consequences would flow  from the\n\n                    \n\n2.  We will  assume without  deciding that the  inspection of\n                                                          \nplaintiff's mail  constitutes censorship.   But see  Royse v.\n                                                          \nSuperior  Court of the State of Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462367\"><a href=\"/opinion/462367/merle-l-royse-v-the-superior-court-of-the-state-of-washington-in-and-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\n                                          \nCir.  1986)  (inspection  for  contraband  of  mail  sent  by\nprisoners to  state court does not  constitute censorship and\ndoes not violate the constitution).\n\n                             -4-\n\n          failure  to  censor a  particular letter.\n          Some   latitude   in   anticipating   the\n          probable consequences of allowing certain\n          speech   in   a  prison   environment  is\n          essential to  the proper discharge  of an\n          administrator's duty.  But any regulation\n          or   practice   that   restricts   inmate\n          correspondence    must    be    generally\n          necessary to protect one  or more of  the\n          legitimate     governmental     interests\n          identified above.\n\nProcunier v.

First,  the   practice  furthers  an  important\n\ngovernmental interest -- security.  As the  Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized,   [\"p]erhaps   the   most  obvious   example   of\n\njustifiable censorship  of prisoner mail would  be refusal to\n\nsend  . .  . letters  concerning  escape plans  or containing\n\nother  information  concerning  proposed criminal  activity.\"\n\nProcunier v.  Martinez, 416  U.S.  at 413.   Plaintiff  would\n                      \n\nargue  that his  mail, directed  to a  school in  an envelope\n\nsupplied by the school, presented no security problem because\n\nescape  or criminal  activity plans  could not  fruitfully be\n\n                             -5-\n\ntransmitted  in this manner.   Plaintiff is wrong.   Were the\n\ninstitution  not a legitimate  one or were  the school's mail\n\nroom employee  in cahoots with  plaintiff, security  concerns\n\ncould well be implicated.\n\n          Plaintiff  argues  that   inspection  of   outgoing\n\ncorrespondence cannot  rationally be justified as  a security\n\nmeasure given,  plaintiff says, that prison  officials do not\n\nmonitor  prisoners'  telephone  calls  or  conversations with\n\nvisitors,  means  by which  prisoners  could  just as  easily\n\ncommunicate escape plans.   Plaintiff  cites to  a number  of\n\nolder cases  which employed  such reasoning in  striking down\n\noutgoing mail inspection practices.   We, however, rejected a\n\nsimilar argument in Feeley v. Sampson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353029\"><a href=\"/opinion/353029/leo-f-feeley-iv-v-george-sampson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1978).   There, the  district court  had reasoned  that\n\n\"because detainees' visits went unmonitored,  escape plans or\n\ncontraband  `drops'  could  be  plotted  regardless   of  any\n\nsurveillance   of   correspondence,\"   and   concluded   that\n\ninspection of  outgoing mail could therefore not be upheld on\n\nsecurity  grounds.  Id. at  374.  We  rejected that reasoning\n                       \n\nand concluded, in substance,  that unmonitored mail increased\n\nprisoners' opportunities for plotting escape and consequently\n\nsurveillance was justified as a security measure.  We  adhere\n\nto that position.\n\n          The   second   Martinez   requirement,   that   the\n                                 \n\nlimitation  be no greater than  necessary, is also  met.  The\n\n                             -6-\n\nlimitation is fairly minimal -- plaintiff can correspond with\n\nthe school provided  he allows prison officials to  check the\n\ncorrespondence  -- and  there is  no other  way to  determine\n\nwhether escape  plans or  other proscribable matter  is being\n\nsent except  by looking  at the correspondence.   Plaintiff's\n\nconstitutional rights  were not violated.   See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.
