Jane  King appeals  from a\n                                   \n\ngrant  of   summary  judgment   entered  in  favor   of  Collagen\n\nCorporation (\"Collagen\") by the  United States District Court for\n\nthe  District of  Massachusetts.   The district  court determined\n\nthat  plaintiff's claims  were  preempted by  the Medical  Device\n\nAmendments of 1976 (\"MDA\"), 21 U.S.C.   360c et seq.  Because the\n                                                    \n\ndistrict court  correctly construed  the preemption provision  of\n\nthe MDA, we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          Defendant Collagen manufactures and distributes Zyderm,\n\na cosmetic medical device used to correct wrinkles and other skin\n\ndeformities.   Zyderm treatment consists  of injecting  processed\n\ncow tissue directly  under the  skin.  Zyderm  then supports  the\n\nskin from underneath, smoothing out deformities on the surface of\n\nthe skin.  The course of  treatment may run for several weeks and\n\nrequires  up  to  six  applications.    Researchers  at  Stanford\n\nUniversity  developed Zyderm  in  the early  1970's and  Collagen\n\nplaced it on the market in the early 1980's.\n\n          As a  medical device, Zyderm falls within  the scope of\n\nthe MDA and thus must  be approved and regulated by the  Food and\n\nDrug Administration (\"FDA\").  As a Class III medical device under\n\nthe MDA scheme, it is subject to the most extensive pre-marketing\n\napproval  requirements  imposed  by  the  MDA  and  to  similarly\n\nextensive  regulation  post-approval.    The  premarket  approval\n\nprocess is designed to provide  a \"reasonable assurance of . .  .\n\nsafety  and  effectiveness\" for  medical  devices  which are  too\n\ndangerous  or unknown  to permit  less regulation.   21  U.S.C.  \n\n360c(1)(C).  Post-approval regulation is designed to keep the FDA\n\napprised  of ongoing  safety  findings or  any other  information\n\nabout the  device  as it  becomes available.   Id.     360e(e)  &amp;\n                                                  \n\n360i(a).\n\n          Pursuant to the pre-marketing approval process, the FDA\n\nrequires applicants to submit proposed labeling, extensive safety\n\ntesting  data  and  descriptions  of  manufacturing  methods  and\n\nmaterials.  Id.   360e(c)(1).   Upon reviewing the materials in a\n               \n\ncomprehensive  manner, the FDA may approve the device for sale or\n\nreturn the  application to the applicant  for further information\n\nor  testing.    Id.     360e(d)(1).   When  the  FDA  returns  an\n                   \n\napplication to the applicant, the FDA must apprise  the applicant\n\nof how to correct all deficiencies.  Id.   360e(d)(2).   Once the\n                                        \n\ndevice  is  approved,  the  FDA  retains  the power  to  withdraw\n\napproval  of  the product  permanently  or  suspend its  approval\n\ntemporarily if it determines that the device has become unsafe or\n\nits labeling inadequate.  Id.   360e(e)(1)(3).  To assist the FDA\n                             \n\nin  making  these  determinations,  manufacturers  must  maintain\n\nrecords and make reports  to the FDA on information  pertinent to\n\nthe device.   Id.   360i(a).  Zyderm passed through the Class III\n                 \n\napproval process  prior to marketing, and  underwent revisions to\n\nthe original approval afterwards.\n\n          Appellant Jane  King sought  Zyderm treatment  in 1987.\n\nFollowing the normal procedure, Ms. King's physician administered\n\na  test dose of Zyderm before proceeding with the full treatment.\n\nShortly  after receiving this test dose, Ms. King suffered muscle\n\n                               -3-\n\nand  joint  pains,  as  well  as  other  symptoms.    Her  doctor\n\nsubsequently diagnosed her as having dermatomyositis/polymyositis\n\n(\"DM/PM\"),  an  autoimmune disease  in  which  the immune  system\n\nattacks skin and muscle tissue as if it were a foreign substance.\n\n          When  Ms. King  received Zyderm,  Zyderm's FDA-approved\n\nlabeling contraindicated  use by those with a personal history of\n\nautoimmune  disease.    Since that  time,  however,  the FDA  has\n\ngradually allowed Collagen  to change the labeling as  it related\n\nto  autoimmune   disease.    By   1991,  Zyderm  was   no  longer\n\ncontraindicated for persons with a history of autoimmune disease.\n\nThe FDA required a warning in 1991, however, that some recipients\n\nhave  suffered from  unwanted autoimmune  reactions, but  that no\n\ncausal  connection between  Zyderm and  these reactions  has been\n\nshown.\n\n          Ms. King  subsequently filed a first  amended complaint\n\ndetailing  seven claims  against Collagen.1   First,  she claimed\n\nthat Collagen was strictly liable for her injuries because Zyderm\n\n                    \n\n1  Ms. King filed suit against Collagen in 1990 alleging that the\ntest dose  of Zyderm caused her  to develop DM/PM.   Count one of\nher suit alleged  that Collagen negligently  tested, manufactured\nand  sold  Zyderm.   Count  two  alleged  that Collagen  breached\nimplied warranties of merchantability.  Count three alleged fraud\nand deceit in the sale of Zyderm.  \n\n   Ms. King  subsequently filed the amended  complaint.  Appellee\ncontends that Ms. King informed appellee that  she would withdraw\nthis amended  complaint.   As  such, appellee  never opposed  its\nentry.   The district court entered the amended complaint, noting\nthat  no opposition  was  filed.   The  district court,  however,\nproceeded  to grant summary judgment  on the basis  of Ms. King's\noriginal  complaint.    Because the  amended  complaint  contains\nessentially similar  claims as  the original complaint,  with few\nadditions, we will address the claims in the amended complaint. \n\n                               -4-\n\nwas unsafe for its intended purpose and unreasonably dangerous to\n\nusers.   Second, she alleged that Zyderm was not safe and fit for\n\nthe  purpose intended  and therefore  was sold  in breach  of the\n\nwarranty  of  merchantability.    Third, Ms.  King  alleged  that\n\nnegligence  in the  design,  manufacture, marketing  and sale  of\n\nZyderm,   including  negligence   in   not  revealing   dangerous\n\npropensities  of the  product, led  to her  injury.   Fourth, she\n\nmaintained that  Collagen  misbranded and/or  mislabeled  Zyderm.\n\nFifth,  she asserted  that  Collagen  made misrepresentations  of\n\nmaterial  fact to Ms. King in selling  Zyderm to her.  Sixth, she\n\nalleged  that  Collagen  failed  to warn  her  of  any  defective\n\ncondition.  Finally, Ms.  King alleged that Collagen fraudulently\n\nobtained FDA approval.\n\n          Collagen  moved  for  summary  judgment  shortly  after\n\nMs. King filed her amended complaint, arguing that FDA regulation\n\nof Zyderm  under the MDA  preempted all  of the causes  of action\n\nalleged  in  the complaint.    The  district  court granted  this\n\nmotion, relying on a  similar case from the Southern  District of\n\nTexas.   This case, Stamps v. Collagen Corp., No. H-90-2242, 1991\n                                            \n\nU.S. Dist.  LEXIS 20666 (S.D.  Tex. 1991), held  that plaintiff's\n\nvarious products liability claims arising out of Zyderm treatment\n\nwere preempted by FDA regulation under the MDA.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n                                I.\n\n          Article  VI of the  Constitution dictates  that federal\n\nlaw \"shall  be the supreme  Law of  the Land; and  the judges  in\n\n                               -5-\n\nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution\n\nor Laws of any  State notwithstanding.\"  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl.\n\n2.  State laws  that conflict with federal laws  and regulations,\n\ntherefore, are preempted.  E.g., Malone v. White Motor Corp., 435\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  497 (1978).  In determining whether such a conflict exists,\n\nit is well settled that the intent of Congress governs.  That is,\n\npreemption does not occur  unless Congress so intended.   Rice v.\n                                                              \n\nSanta Fe Elevator Corp., 435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978).\n                       \n\n          Congress may  express its  intent to preempt  state law\n\nexplicitly in the language of the statute.  Jones v. Rath Packing\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 430 U.S. 519,  525 (1977).  Congress may express  its intent\n   \n\nimplicitly  by   passing  an  extensive   statutory  scheme  that\n\nextensively  covers the  field of  regulation.   Fidelity Federal\n                                                                 \n\nSav. &amp;  Loan Ass'n v.  de la  Cuesta, 458 U.S.  141, 153  (1982).\n                                    \n\nImplied preemption  also occurs when a conflict between state and\n\nfederal law makes compliance with both  impossible, or when state\n\nlaw would  frustrate the  purpose and objectives  of the  federal\n\nlaw.  Id. (citing Florida  Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.  v. Paul,\n                                                                \n\n373 U.S. 132, 142-43 (1963); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67\n                                                \n\n(1941)).\n\n          We are aided in our determination of preemption in this\n\ncase  by the Supreme Court's  recent treatment of  the subject in\n\nCipollone  v. Liggett Group,  Inc., 112 S.  Ct. 2608 (1992).   In\n                                  \n\nCipollone,  a  victim  of  lung  cancer  sued  several  cigarette\n         \n\nmanufacturers for  breach  of warranties  contained in  cigarette\n\nadvertisements,  for failure to warn of health hazards related to\n\n                               -6-\n\nsmoking, for  fraudulently misrepresenting  those hazards  to the\n\npublic, and  for conspiracy  to deprive  the public  of important\n\nhealth information.   Id. at  2613.  The  cigarette manufacturers\n                         \n\ncontended that petitioner's claims  were preempted by the federal\n\nlaw  requiring  a  health  warning  to  appear on  all  cigarette\n\nadvertisements and containers.2  Id. at 2614.\n                                    \n\n          In analyzing  preemption, the Court relied  only on the\n\nspecific  language of  the provision  regarding preemption.   The\n\nCourt reasoned that \"Congress'  enactment of a provision defining\n\nthe  preemptive reach  of a statute  implies that  matters beyond\n\nthat reach  are not preempted.\"   Id. at 2618.   The opinion thus\n                                     \n\nanalyzed  each of  petitioner's  claims in  light of  the express\n\nlanguage  of the  preemption provision  in the  cigarette warning\n\nstatute.\n\n          The plurality held that the provision preempted failure\n\nto warn claims as to advertising practices, but not as to testing\n\nor research practices.   Id. at 2621-22.  The  plurality reasoned\n                            \n\nthat  the  Act only  preempted state  law  claims arising  out of\n\ncigarette advertising and promotion, and that appellant's  claims\n\narising out of testing and research did not relate to advertising\n\nand promotion.  The  provision preempted petitioner's  fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation  claim  that cigarette  advertising neutralized\n\n                    \n\n2  That law stated that \"[n]o requirement or prohibition based on\nsmoking or health shall  be imposed under State law  with respect\nto the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of\nwhich are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\"\nFederal Cigarette Labeling and  Advertising Act of 1965,    5, as\namended by Public Health  Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969,    2, 15\nU.S.C.   1334.\n\n                               -7-\n\nthe effect of the warning in a similar fashion.   Id. at 2623-24.\n                                                     \n\nThe provision, however, did not  preempt fraud claims arising out\n\nof  communication  other than  advertising,  such  as information\n\nrequired to be disclosed  to an administrative agency, or  out of\n\nfraudulent statements  made in  the advertising but  unrelated to\n\nthe health warning.  Id.\n                        \n\n          The plurality  further held that the  provision did not\n\npreempt express  warranty claims, because those  claims arose due\n\nto  the conduct  of  the manufacturers  who  made the  warranties\n\nrather than from state law.  Id. at 2622.  Finally, the plurality\n                                \n\nheld that the provision did not preempt the conspiracy to deprive\n\nthe public of material  facts claims, because they did  not arise\n\nout of state  law pertaining  to smoking and  health, but  rather\n\narose out of a  \"duty not to conspire  to commit fraud.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n2624.\n\n          The analysis  of the plurality in  Cipollone guides our\n                                                      \n\nanalysis  in this  case.   We  begin by  noting that  the express\n\npreemption provision  in the  MDA, 21  U.S.C.    360k, forecloses\n\ninquiry into  implied preemption, because the  fact that Congress\n\nincluded it in the MDA implies that matters beyond its  reach are\n\nnot preempted.   Further, we  note that  the Cipollone  plurality\n                                                      \n\ncarefully construed the preemption provision to extend no further\n\nthan its language warranted.   In doing so, the  plurality sought\n\nto pay proper respect  to federal-state relations.  This  concern\n\narises  out of \"the assumption that the historic police powers of\n\nthe states [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless\n\n                               -8-\n\nthat  [is]   the  clear   and  manifest  purpose   of  Congress.\"\n\nCipollone, 112 S. Ct. at 2617 (citing Rice, 331 U.S. at 230).  We\n                                          \n\ntoo  will carefully construe the preemption  provision of the MDA\n\nto give due regard to questions of federal-state relations.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Bearing  these  principles  in  mind, we  turn  to  the\n\nlanguage of the statute in question.  The MDA states that \n\n            (a) Except as provided in  subsection (b)\n            of  this section,  no State  or political\n            subdivision of  a State may  establish or\n            continue  in  effect  with  respect  to a\n            device   intended   for  human   use  any\n            requirement--\n\n            (1)   which  is  different  from,  or  in\n            addition  to, any  requirement applicable\n            under this chapter to the device, and \n\n            (2)  which  relates   to  the  safety  or\n            effectiveness of  the  device or  to  any\n            other  matter  included in  a requirement\n            applicable  to  the  device   under  this\n            chapter.\n\n21 U.S.C.    360k.  Under subsection  (b) of   360k, a  state may\n\npetition  the  FDA  in   certain  circumstances  to  allow  state\n\nrequirements to  continue  in force.   Because  no such  petition\n\naffects this  case, we  are concerned  only  with the  preemptive\n\neffect  of  subsection  (a).    Under  subsection  (a),  we  must\n\ndetermine whether appellant's products liability claims give rise\n\nto  state law requirements in addition to or different from those\n\nmandated by the FDA.\n\n          We  turn  first  to  the  FDA's  own  understanding  of\n\nsubsection (a) for guidance.  See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n                                                                 \n\nResources Defense  Council, Inc.,  467 U.S. 837  (1984) (agency's\n                                \n\n                               -9-\n\ninterpretation of its own  statute is controlling so long  as not\n\ncontrary  to Congress'  intent).   FDA  regulations provide  that\n\npreemption  does not apply when the FDA has issued no regulations\n\nor  other requirements  specific to  the particular  device.   21\n\nC.F.R.   808.1(d).   In this case,  it is clear that  the FDA has\n\nimposed requirements  on  Zyderm  related  to  labeling,  design,\n\nmanufacturing and other aspects of the device pursuant to the MDA\n\nscheme.\n\n          If  the  FDA  has  issued requirements  for  a  device,\n\nsubsection (a) prohibits  states from  imposing any  requirements\n\nwhich differ from or add to the FDA requirements, or which relate\n\nto the  safety or effectiveness  of the device.   A \"State .  . .\n\nrequirement\" in  subsection (a) may emanate  from any requirement\n\nestablished  by a  state including  statutes,  regulations, court\n\ndecisions  or ordinances.   21  C.F.R.    808.1(b); see  also San\n                                                                 \n\nDiego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 247 (1959)\n                                       \n\n(\"[State]  regulation can  be as  effectively exerted  through an\n\naward of  damages as through some form of preventive relief.  The\n\nobligation  to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be,\n\na potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.\").\n\n          The language  of subsection  (a) and the  definition of\n\nstate  requirement promulgated  under it  demonstrate a  field of\n\npreemption  which is broad,  but limited.   Any state requirement\n\nwhich, in  effect, establishes a new  substantive requirement for\n\nthe  device in a regulated  area such as  labeling, is preempted.\n\n21  C.F.R.    808.1(d)(6)(ii).   As  the  Seventh Circuit  noted,\n\n                               -10-\n\nhowever, subsection (a) of  the MDA does not preempt  such claims\n\nas  negligent  implantation  or  removal of  devices,  or  claims\n\narising out of contaminated devices.  Slater v. Optical Radiation\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.,  961 F.2d 1330, 1334  (7th Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 1992\n                                                           \n\nU.S. LEXIS 6436 (Oct. 13, 1992).\n\n          Armed with  this understanding  of  subsection (a),  we\n\nwill analyze  petitioner's claims  individually to determine  the\n\neffect of the MDA preemption provision on each.\n\n          A.  Strict Liability\n                              \n\n          Appellant  contends  that  Zyderm  is  unsafe  for  its\n\nintended purpose  and unreasonably  dangerous to users,  and that\n\nCollagen  therefore is liable for any  injuries Zyderm may cause.\n\nIndeed, class III devices such as Zyderm are those that present a\n\n\"potential  unreasonable risk  of  illness or  injury\" such  that\n\nextensive regulation  is required to ensure  reasonably safe use.\n\n21 U.S.C.   360c(a)(1)(C).   The FDA must evaluate  these devices\n\nwith regard to those for  whose use the device is intended.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\n  360c(a)(2)(A).    The entire  MDA  scheme  for such  Class  III\n\ndevices  as  Zyderm,  therefore,  is  aimed  at  determining  and\n\nregulating  the intended purpose of the device, and at ensuring a\n\nreasonable level of safety for its users.\n\n          It  is clear  that appellant's  strict liability  claim\n\nwould impose requirements related to the safety and effectiveness\n\nof  Zyderm.  If successful,  the claim would  require Collagen to\n\nredesign  Zyderm, remove  it from  the market,  or be  subject to\n\nstrict liability.   The MDA  does not permit  this.   Appellant's\n\n                               -11-\n\nclaim  would  force us  to determine  that  Zyderm is  unsafe and\n\ndangerous, in  opposition to  the contrary determination  made by\n\nthe  FDA under the MDA.  Subsection (a) protects manufacturers of\n\nmedical devices approved by the FDA under the MDA from such state\n\nlaw intrusion.\n\n          B.  Breach of Warranty\n                                \n\n          Appellant  claims  that Collagen  breached  express and\n\nimplied  warranties   of  merchantability   and  fitness   for  a\n\nparticular purpose.   Appellant's  express warranty  claims arise\n\nout of  the labeling  and packaging of  Zyderm, all of  which are\n\nregulated  by the FDA.  In labeling and packaging, Collagen could\n\nnot say any  less than what the FDA  required, and appellee could\n\nonly  add   extra  warnings   or  safety  information,   but  not\n\nwarranties, without FDA approval.   Appellant's express  warranty\n\nclaims therefore  are preempted because any  such warranties only\n\ncould  arise  out of  the  FDA-approved  labeling and  packaging.\n\nAllowing  appellant's express  warranty claims  effectively would\n\nimpose additional or different requirements on  Zyderm's labeling\n\nand packaging.\n\n          We  note that  the Court's  holding in  Cipollone would\n                                                           \n\nseem to require the opposite result  in this case.  However,  the\n\nwarnings at issue  in Cipollone were  different than those  here.\n                               \n\nIn  Cipollone, the  statute required  cigarette manufacturers  to\n             \n\ninclude  a brief  health  warning in  their advertisements;  this\n\nwarning did not affect cigarette advertisements in any other way.\n\nThe manufacturers  were  free to  make  any claims  they  wished,\n\n                               -12-\n\nincluding express warranties.  Here, however, the MDA has imposed\n\nmuch   more   extensive   regulation  upon   class   III   device\n\nmanufacturers.   The FDA retains rigid  control over the entirety\n\nof  the labeling  and packaging  of class  III  products, largely\n\ndisplacing  the  ability  of  manufacturers  to  make  additional\n\nclaims.  This high level of control contrasts with  the low level\n\nof control in Cipollone, and ensures  that manufacturers will not\n                       \n\nbe held liable for packaging and labeling imposed by the FDA.\n\n          Appellant  also  alleges   that  Collagen  breached  an\n\nimplied warranty of merchantability,  and that this breach caused\n\nher injuries.   As an implied  warranty is  a requirement upon  a\n\nproduct  that  arises exclusively  from  the  operation of  state\n\ncontract  law,  this claim  is  preempted expressly  by  the MDA.\n\nOtherwise,  it would  impose  a requirement  additional to  those\n\nimposed under the MDA.\n\n          C.  Negligence\n                        \n\n          Appellant's  third  claim  alleges  negligence  in  the\n\ndesign, manufacture,  marketing and sale  of Zyderm.   This claim\n\nalso is preempted by the  MDA.  If the MDA does nothing  else, it\n\nregulates the  design, manufacture,  sale and marketing  of class\n\nIII medical  devices in  an extensive  way.   The  MDA does  this\n\nthrough the  packaging and  labeling requirements  which directly\n\naffect  the  marketing  and  sale  of  the  product.    The  same\n\nrequirements  also  affect  the  design and  manufacture  of  the\n\nproduct in that these processes  must be approved by the FDA  and\n\ndescribed in the product's packaging and labeling.\n\n                               -13-\n\n          As  the  design,  manufacture, marketing  and  sale  of\n\nZyderm  is the subject of FDA regulation, the negligence claim is\n\npreempted.    Otherwise,  a  finding of  negligence  would  force\n\nCollagen  to alter  these aspects  of Zyderm  in response  to the\n\nfinding  of liability, or be subject to liability.  Either result\n\nimpermissibly would  impose  an  additional  or  different  state\n\nrequirement upon  the design, manufacture, marketing  and sale of\n\nZyderm.\n\n          D.  Product Misbranding, Misrepresentation &amp; Failure to\n                                                                 \n              Warn\n                  \n\n          Appellant  contends  that   Zyderm  was  misbranded  or\n\nmislabeled.  Misbranding generally occurs when labeling is \"false\n\nor misleading\"  in any particular. 31 U.S.C.   352(a).  Under the\n\nMDA, the FDA must  reject proposed labeling when the  labeling is\n\n\"false or misleading  in any particular.\"   Id.    360e(d)(2)(D).\n                                               \n\nAs  there  is  no  indication  in  the  record  that  the  Zyderm\n\nadministered  to Ms. King was anything  but what the FDA-approved\n\nlabeling  said it  would  be,  notwithstanding  appellant's  bald\n\nstatements, we find this claim preempted.\n\n          Appellant's fifth and sixth claims of misrepresentation\n\nand failure to warn are preempted for similar reasons.  A finding\n\nthat Collagen  misrepresented Zyderm to appellant  would impose a\n\nrequirement on  Collagen to change  its packaging or  labeling in\n\norder to  correct the  misrepresentation.   The  failure to  warn\n\nclaims similarly challenge the adequacy of Zyderm's FDA-regulated\n\npackaging and labeling.  The MDA forecloses these  claims because\n\nCollagen  cannot  be  forced  to change  Zyderm's  packaging  and\n\n                               -14-\n\nlabeling by virtue of these state law damage claims.\n\n          E.  Fraud\n                   \n\n          Appellant's final cause of action alleges that Collagen\n\nfraudulently obtained  FDA approval at the  premarketing stage of\n\nthe MDA  process, and asks for  treble damages due to  the fraud.\n\nThis cause  of action is  more unclear than  her other  causes of\n\naction.  Collagen  insists that  the claim  originally was  based\n\nupon Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 231,    85J, an antifraud  statute, while\n\nappellant urges that  it was based on a more  general duty not to\n\ndeceive.\n\n          Section 85J  provides  that \"[w]hoever,  by  deceit  or\n\nfraud,  sells  personal property  shall be  liable  in tort  to a\n\npurchaser in treble the amount of damages sustained by him.\"  The\n\nlanguage of this statute corresponds to Ms. King's fraud claim in\n\nproviding for treble damages.  Because Ms. King has not specified\n\nany  applicable statute, or other  reason why she  is entitled to\n\ntreble  damages  under a  general duty  not  to deceive,  we must\n\nconclude that  the fraud claim originally arose under   85J.  The\n\ndistrict  court made the same finding in its memorandum and order\n\nin this case.\n\n          To state a claim  for fraud under   85J,  the plaintiff\n\nmust be in  privity with  the seller.   Kourouvacilis v.  General\n                                                                 \n\nMotors Corp., 410 Mass. 706, 575 N.E.2d 734, 735 (1991).  In this\n            \n\ncase,  no  privity existed  between  appellant  and Collagen,  as\n\nCollagen only sold its product directly to appellant's physician.\n\nThus, as a  matter of Massachusetts law, appellant's  fraud claim\n\n                               -15-\n\nmust fail.\n\n          We further note that  the fraud claim is, at  bottom, a\n\nfailure to warn claim.  It seeks to show that Collagen had a duty\n\nto  provide  different  information  in  Zyderm's  packaging  and\n\nlabeling than that which was  approved by the FDA.  As  such, the\n\nclaim is preempted expressly by the MDA.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Because  we  have  determined that  the  MDA  expressly\n\npreempts  Ms. King's state law  tort claims, the  judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                                            \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n                               -15-\n\n            ALDRICH,  Senior Circuit Judge, with whom CAMPBELL,\n                                          \n\n  Senior Circuit Judge, joins, concurring.  While we agree with\n                      \n\n  our brother Torruella's result, and a good deal that he says,\n\n  we approach this case somewhat differently.  First, a  matter\n\n  of  housekeeping.   On  December 13,  1991,  a year  past the\n\n  scheduled  date for  completion of  the pleadings,  plaintiff\n\n  filed a motion  to allow an amended complaint, accompanied by\n\n  the complaint.  On  December 17 she wrote defendant  that she\n\n  would withdraw  her motion.  Defendant,  accordingly, did not\n\n  oppose.  On December 27 defendant moved for summary judgment.\n\n  In opposing defendant's motion for judgment plaintiff made no\n\n  mention  of the proposed new complaint, but, in fact, she did\n\n  not withdraw  her motion,  and  the court  later allowed  it.\n\n  However, the court's ultimate order granting summary judgment\n\n  did not mention the amendment.\n\n            At first  blush  we might  agree  with  defendant's\n\n  objection  that  there  were  substantive  additions  in  the\n\n  amended  complaint,  particularly  with  relation  to  fraud.\n\n  Apart from fraud, the rest of  the amended complaint contains\n\n  six  claims as  against,  originally, two  -- negligence  and\n\n  breach of implied warranty.  There was definitely a purported\n\n  enlargement  -- a state tort of strict liability, and a claim\n\n  of express warranty.  While the negligence alleged is limited\n\n  to designing and producing a dangerous product, and  not that\n\n  the sample sold  plaintiff was  in some way  a departure  and\n\n                               -16-\n\n  individually  defective,  plaintiff   adds  mislabeling   and\n\n  misrepresentation, and, finally, failure to warn.\n\n            Taking defendant's now alleged seven sins, we group\n\n  them  as  follows.    Strict  liability  (negligent  design),\n\n  implied warranty,  negligence,  mislabeling, and  failure  to\n\n  warn are really all  of a piece --  failure to warn.   On the\n\n  record  it is clear  that had there  been a warning  that the\n\n  product  might  cause the  disease  that  plaintiff allegedly\n\n  suffered she would have no claim under any of these headings.\n\n  On  this basis  there  is thus  no  real enlargement  by  the\n\n  amended  complaint.   Express warranty might  be enlargement,\n\n  but  there is no basis for  claiming it.3  Finally, fraud and\n\n  misrepresentation  are  not  as   newly  put  as  they  look.\n\n  Defendant would have it  that the original allegation related\n\n  only  to representations  made to  the plaintiff.   Plaintiff\n\n  states   that   she   intended   her   language  to   include\n\n  misrepresentations  to  the  agency.   Two  of  her  exhibits\n\n  seeking  to raise an issue on the motion for summary judgment\n\n  bear  this  out.    The  amendment   should  stand,  as  mere\n\n  clarification.  However, we read fraud more broadly than does\n\n  our brother, and shall return to it later.\n\n            All agree  that there is one basic  issue:  federal\n\n  preemption.   Preemption may apply against  state judicial as\n\n                      \n\n  3.  Express  warranty might  have created  a problem  for the\n  defense of preemption, cf.  Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,\n                                                              \n  112 S. Ct. 2608, 2622-23 (1992).\n\n                               -17-\n\n  well  as  legislative action,4  Cipollone  v.

This is\n                           \n\n  especially  so when  the  subject is  the  state interest  in\n\n  health and safety.   Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical\n                                                               \n\n  Labs, Inc., 471 U.S.  707, 715, 718-19 (1985).   The question\n            \n\n  is Congressional intent.  Wood  v. General Motors Corp.,  865\n                                                         \n\n  F.2d  395, 401 (1st Cir.  1988), cert. denied,  494 U.S. 1065\n                                               \n\n  (1990).   Here, concededly,  the statute's purpose  is health\n\n  protection,  but  the  parties  disagree  as  to  its  scope.\n\n  Plaintiff  says it  is  directed to  the  individual user  by\n\n  keeping harmful  products off the market  and assuring proper\n\n  warnings.  Defendant says it is also to benefit the public at\n\n  large   by   shielding   regulated    manufacturers   against\n\n  inconsistent state regulation, including lawsuits.   If their\n\n  legal risks may be too great, worthwhile  medical devices may\n\n  be left in the laboratory, to the public's loss.\n\n            Public  health is  a  valid  federal  purpose,  and\n\n  Congress   can  reasonably   weigh  possible   loss  to   the\n\n  idiosyncratic few  against benefits to the  public generally.\n\n  See, e.g.,  Mary Beth Neraas, The  National Childhood Vaccine\n           \n\n  Injury  Act of  1986:   A Solution  to the  Vaccine Liability\n\n                      \n\n  4.  A  matter that  may have  troubled the  court in  Wood v.\n                                                            \n  General Motors, post.

The  legislative\n\n  history  shows  that  this  was  precisely the  Congressional\n\n  intent.     Concededly,  the  U.S.   Code  Congressional  and\n\n  Administrative News, 94th  Congress, Second Session,  Vol. 3,\n\n  pp. 1070  et seq., Medical  Device Amendments of  1976, shows\n                  \n\n  the  principal  emphasis  to  be  on  the  protection of  the\n\n  individual  user.  But it also shows the intent to \"encourage\n\n  . . . research and development\"  and \"permit new and improved\n\n  devices to be marketed without delay.\"  Infra.  Perfection is\n                                               \n\n  impossible  and   a  few  individuals  may   be  denied  full\n\n  protection at the cost of benefitting the rest.\n\n            Contained  within the  Senate  Report (94-33)5  are\n\n  the following.\n\n                 As medicine  progresses, as research\n            makes  new  breakthroughs, an  increasing\n            number   of   sophisticated,   critically\n            important   medical  devices   are  being\n            developed  and used in the United States.\n            These   devices   hold  the   promise  of\n            improving the health and longevity of the\n            American  people.  The Committee wants to\n            encourage their research and development.\n            [1071]\n\n                 S. 2368 recognizes the benefits that\n            medical  research and  experimentation to\n            develop  devices offers  to mankind.   It\n            recognizes, too, the need  for regulation\n            to  assure that  the public  is protected\n            and  that  health professionals  can have\n            more  confidence  in  the performance  of\n            devices.  [1075]\n\n                      \n\n  5.  The Senate bill was passed in lieu of the House bill.\n\n                               -19-\n\n                 The Committee recognizes the rapidly\n            changing nature of the  devices field and\n            therefore feels that  provisions must  be\n            made to  amend standards on the  basis of\n            improved  technology  or  new  scientific\n            evidence.  Such amendments should be made\n            in   an   expedited   fashion   so   that\n            appropriate   changes   can  be   rapidly\n            implemented.      The  purpose   of  this\n            authority  is to  permit new  or improved\n            devices to  be marketed without  delay so\n            that the public may have  such beneficial\n            devices  available to  them  as  soon  as\n            possible.  [1083]\n\n            Translating this  into a simple concept, and taking\n\n  the difference of  opinion between the parties  to be whether\n\n  the FDA  requirements are merely  minimum, or  are the  total\n\n  maximum protection afforded  the individual user, we  believe\n\n  this  a clear  demonstration of  Congressional choice  of the\n\n  latter.   We  further find  that the  comprehensive statutory\n\n  language conforms thereto.\n\n            21 U.S.C.   360e(c)(1) provides,\n\n                 (1)   Any person  may file  with the\n            Secretary  an  application for  premarket\n            approval for a class III device.

As all but  one of  plaintiff's\n\n  sustainable  claims  are  premised  on  a  failure  to  warn,\n\n  preemption here  is  unavoidable, given  the  subsection  (F)\n\n  requirement that labels be reviewed by the FDA.\n\n            It follows that  most of plaintiff's  arguments are\n\n  beside  the  mark.   A  few,  however,  may deserve  mention.\n\n  Plaintiff claims  that because of the  regulation reported in\n\n  21  C.F.R. 814.39(d)(1),  to the  effect that  a manufacturer\n\n  \"may,\"  without  prior approval,  make  certain  changes that\n\n  enhance safety, defendant  had a duty to make such  here.  It\n\n  is  sufficient to  say that  to interpret  \"may\"  as \"should\"\n\n  would unravel the entire garment.  Second, citing Silkwood v.\n                                                            \n\n  Kerr-McGee Corp.,  464 U.S.  238, 251 (1984),  plaintiff says\n                  \n\n  that,  if defendant is correct,  she has no  cause of action.\n\n  Given an ambiguity,  this objection is a factor  in statutory\n\n  construction, but, of itself,  it cannot create an ambiguity,\n\n                               -22-\n\n  or there could never be preemption.   Finally, plaintiff says\n\n  that  the  FDA's  preemption  regulation,  21 CFR    808.1(d)\n\n  conflicts  with  our result.   When  a  statute is  clear the\n\n  agency  interpretation must  give way.   Hillsborough County,\n                                                              \n\n  471 U.S. at 714-15.\n\n            A  more  troublesome  issue is  the  claim  labeled\n\n  fraud.\n\n                              FRAUD\n                                   \n\n                 . . . Defendant Collagen Corporation\n            fraudulently obtained FDA approval of the\n            Zyderm PMA, product  and labeling,  which\n            was  a producing  or  proximate cause  of\n            damage    and   injury    to   Plaintiff.\n            Defendant . . . further acted to suppress\n            the facts, blame injuries or other causes\n            that  its  product   (sic)  and   prevent\n            disclosure of the true risks.[6]\n\n            Plaintiff  has  a case  in  point.   In  Hurley  v.\n                                                           \n\n  Lederle Laboratories Division  of American Cyanamid Co.,  863\n                                                         \n\n  F.2d 1173 (5th  Cir. 1988), the  court, though agreeing  with\n\n  the  district court that  the FDA regulation  with respect to\n\n  defendant's vaccine labeling  was intended to  be preemptive,\n\n  remanded.  At issue  was the same tension  between protecting\n\n  idiosyncratic individuals  and the public health.   Balancing\n\n  these, the Court concluded,\n\n                      \n\n  6.  As  in the  original complaint,  plaintiff  sought treble\n  damages.    Though  not  mentioned,  presumably  this  demand\n  invoked Mass. G.L. c. 231,   85J, that awards  treble damages\n  in certain  cases of \"deceit or  fraud.\"  We do  not read it,\n  however, as limiting the scope of plaintiff's claims.\n\n                               -23-\n\n            [T]his issue should  be presented to  the\n            jury    in    the    form   of    special\n            interrogatories, questioning  whether and\n            what    information    the   manufacturer\n            withheld  from  the   FDA,  if  any,  and\n            whether  possession  of this  information\n            would have materially altered the content\n            of  the  FDA's  warning.    This  special\n            procedure  is  justified  by the  federal\n            interest in  encouraging manufacturers to\n            produce    vaccines,   in    that   those\n            manufacturers need some assurance that if\n            they     follow     certain    prescribed\n            procedures,  such  as  including an  FDA-\n            approved warning, they are complying with\n            the law.\n\n  Id.  at 1180.  With respect, one may wonder how \"encouraging\"\n    \n\n  manufacturers  would view the ruling.7   Rather, we side with\n\n  the later case  of Papas v. Upjohn  Co., 926 F.2d 1019  (11th\n                                         \n\n  Cir. 1991), where the court said, at 1026 n.8,\n\n            To  the extent  that  Hurley purports  to\n                                        \n            recognize   an   exception   to   federal\n            preemption  of  common law  tort labeling\n            claims when the federal  statute involved\n            explicitly prohibits  state regulation of\n            labeling  and  the  federal   agency  has\n            received incomplete  information from the\n            manufacturer,  we  reject its  holding at\n            least   as  applied   to  FIFRA-regulated\n            pesticides.  Given  the FIFRA  regulatory\n            scheme, it would be up  to the EPA -- and\n            not  a  jury  -- to  determine  first (1)\n               \n            whether  the   information  provided  was\n            incomplete or inaccurate; (2) whether the\n            omitted information is significant enough\n            to mandate a change in the label; and (3)\n            how, if  at  all,  the  label  should  be\n            corrected.\n\n                      \n\n  7.  Indeed,  we  are reminded  of  the  observation that  the\n  British  hanged  a  negligent  admiral  \"pour  encourager les\n  autres.\"  Voltaire, Candide, Ch. 23.\n                             \n\n                               -24-\n\n  To prove fraud, plaintiff must show causality.  Surely, where\n\n  the FDA  was  authorized to  render  the expert  decision  on\n\n  Collagen's  use and labeling, it, and not some jury or judge,\n\n  is best suited to determine the factual issues and what their\n\n  effect would have been on its original conclusions.  Further,\n\n  if the court erred, and incorrectly posited the effect on the\n\n  FDA's use and  labeling decision, this  would impose a  state\n\n  requirement \"which is different from, or in  addition to, any\n\n  requirement  applicable  . . . to  the  device.\"   21  U.S.C.\n\n    360k(a).    In addition  to  running afoul  of  the general\n\n  principle against implying  personal causes of  action, Royal\n                                                               \n\n  Bus Group, Inc.  v. Realist,  Inc., 933 F.2d  1056 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \n\n  1991), plaintiff  would be breaching the federal  dyke in the\n\n  absence of its keeper.\n\n            Papas  has  been vacated  and remanded  for further\n                 \n\n  consideration in the light of Cipollone, 112 S. Ct. 2608, but\n                                         \n\n  we do not believe  this to be a reversal on that  point.  Our\n\n  position is  consistent with Cipollone, that  did not preempt\n                                        \n\n  fraud found to be  outside the communication targeted  by the\n\n  regulation.8  112 S. Ct. at 2623-24.\n\n                      \n\n  8.  Plaintiff    similarly    presents     a    claim     for\n  misrepresentation, both  to  the public  and  to  plaintiff's\n  physician.  As the  record shows no statements to  the public\n  or  physicians that go beyond those approved by the FDA, this\n  claim collapses into that of fraud on the FDA.\n\n                               -25-\n",

The district  court determined\n\nthat  plaintiff's claims  were  preempted by  the Medical  Device\n\nAmendments of 1976 (\"MDA\"), 21 U.S.C.   360c et seq.  Because the\n                                                    \n\ndistrict court  correctly construed  the preemption provision  of\n\nthe MDA, we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          Defendant Collagen manufactures and distributes Zyderm,\n\na cosmetic medical device used to correct wrinkles and other skin\n\ndeformities.   Zyderm treatment consists  of injecting  processed\n\ncow tissue directly  under the  skin.  Zyderm  then supports  the\n\nskin from underneath, smoothing out deformities on the surface of\n\nthe skin.  The course of  treatment may run for several weeks and\n\nrequires  up  to  six  applications.    Researchers  at  Stanford\n\nUniversity  developed Zyderm  in  the early  1970's and  Collagen\n\nplaced it on the market in the early 1980's.\n\n          As a  medical device, Zyderm falls within  the scope of\n\nthe MDA and thus must  be approved and regulated by the  Food and\n\nDrug Administration (\"FDA\").  As a Class III medical device under\n\nthe MDA scheme, it is subject to the most extensive pre-marketing\n\napproval  requirements  imposed  by  the  MDA  and  to  similarly\n\nextensive  regulation  post-approval.    The  premarket  approval\n\nprocess is designed to provide  a \"reasonable assurance of . .  .\n\nsafety  and  effectiveness\" for  medical  devices  which are  too\n\ndangerous  or unknown  to permit  less regulation.   21  U.S.C.  \n\n360c(1)(C).  Post-approval regulation is designed to keep the FDA\n\napprised  of ongoing  safety  findings or  any other  information\n\nabout the  device  as it  becomes available.   Id.     360e(e)  &amp;\n                                                  \n\n360i(a).\n\n          Pursuant to the pre-marketing approval process, the FDA\n\nrequires applicants to submit proposed labeling, extensive safety\n\ntesting  data  and  descriptions  of  manufacturing  methods  and\n\nmaterials.  Id.   360e(c)(1).   Upon reviewing the materials in a\n               \n\ncomprehensive  manner, the FDA may approve the device for sale or\n\nreturn the  application to the applicant  for further information\n\nor  testing.    Id.     360e(d)(1).   When  the  FDA  returns  an\n                   \n\napplication to the applicant, the FDA must apprise  the applicant\n\nof how to correct all deficiencies.  Id.   360e(d)(2).   Once the\n                                        \n\ndevice  is  approved,  the  FDA  retains  the power  to  withdraw\n\napproval  of  the product  permanently  or  suspend its  approval\n\ntemporarily if it determines that the device has become unsafe or\n\nits labeling inadequate.  Id.   360e(e)(1)(3).  To assist the FDA\n                             \n\nin  making  these  determinations,  manufacturers  must  maintain\n\nrecords and make reports  to the FDA on information  pertinent to\n\nthe device.   Id.   360i(a).  Zyderm passed through the Class III\n                 \n\napproval process  prior to marketing, and  underwent revisions to\n\nthe original approval afterwards.\n\n          Appellant Jane  King sought  Zyderm treatment  in 1987.\n\nFollowing the normal procedure, Ms. King's physician administered\n\na  test dose of Zyderm before proceeding with the full treatment.\n\nShortly  after receiving this test dose, Ms. King suffered muscle\n\n                               -3-\n\nand  joint  pains,  as  well  as  other  symptoms.    Her  doctor\n\nsubsequently diagnosed her as having dermatomyositis/polymyositis\n\n(\"DM/PM\"),  an  autoimmune disease  in  which  the immune  system\n\nattacks skin and muscle tissue as if it were a foreign substance.\n\n          When  Ms. King  received Zyderm,  Zyderm's FDA-approved\n\nlabeling contraindicated  use by those with a personal history of\n\nautoimmune  disease.    Since that  time,  however,  the FDA  has\n\ngradually allowed Collagen  to change the labeling as  it related\n\nto  autoimmune   disease.    By   1991,  Zyderm  was   no  longer\n\ncontraindicated for persons with a history of autoimmune disease.\n\nThe FDA required a warning in 1991, however, that some recipients\n\nhave  suffered from  unwanted autoimmune  reactions, but  that no\n\ncausal  connection between  Zyderm and  these reactions  has been\n\nshown.\n\n          Ms. King  subsequently filed a first  amended complaint\n\ndetailing  seven claims  against Collagen.1   First,  she claimed\n\nthat Collagen was strictly liable for her injuries because Zyderm\n\n                    \n\n1  Ms. King filed suit against Collagen in 1990 alleging that the\ntest dose  of Zyderm caused her  to develop DM/PM.   Count one of\nher suit alleged  that Collagen negligently  tested, manufactured\nand  sold  Zyderm.   Count  two  alleged  that Collagen  breached\nimplied warranties of merchantability.  Count three alleged fraud\nand deceit in the sale of Zyderm.  \n\n   Ms. King  subsequently filed the amended  complaint.  Appellee\ncontends that Ms. King informed appellee that  she would withdraw\nthis amended  complaint.   As  such, appellee  never opposed  its\nentry.   The district court entered the amended complaint, noting\nthat  no opposition  was  filed.   The  district court,  however,\nproceeded  to grant summary judgment  on the basis  of Ms. King's\noriginal  complaint.    Because the  amended  complaint  contains\nessentially similar  claims as  the original complaint,  with few\nadditions, we will address the claims in the amended complaint. \n\n                               -4-\n\nwas unsafe for its intended purpose and unreasonably dangerous to\n\nusers.   Second, she alleged that Zyderm was not safe and fit for\n\nthe  purpose intended  and therefore  was sold  in breach  of the\n\nwarranty  of  merchantability.    Third, Ms.  King  alleged  that\n\nnegligence  in the  design,  manufacture, marketing  and sale  of\n\nZyderm,   including  negligence   in   not  revealing   dangerous\n\npropensities  of the  product, led  to her  injury.   Fourth, she\n\nmaintained that  Collagen  misbranded and/or  mislabeled  Zyderm.\n\nFifth,  she asserted  that  Collagen  made misrepresentations  of\n\nmaterial  fact to Ms. King in selling  Zyderm to her.  Sixth, she\n\nalleged  that  Collagen  failed  to warn  her  of  any  defective\n\ncondition.  Finally, Ms.  King alleged that Collagen fraudulently\n\nobtained FDA approval.\n\n          Collagen  moved  for  summary  judgment  shortly  after\n\nMs. King filed her amended complaint, arguing that FDA regulation\n\nof Zyderm  under the MDA  preempted all  of the causes  of action\n\nalleged  in  the complaint.    The  district  court granted  this\n\nmotion, relying on a  similar case from the Southern  District of\n\nTexas.   This case, Stamps v. Collagen Corp., No. H-90-2242, 1991\n                                            \n\nU.S. Dist.  LEXIS 20666 (S.D.  Tex. 1991), held  that plaintiff's\n\nvarious products liability claims arising out of Zyderm treatment\n\nwere preempted by FDA regulation under the MDA.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n                                I.\n\n          Article  VI of the  Constitution dictates  that federal\n\nlaw \"shall  be the supreme  Law of  the Land; and  the judges  in\n\n                               -5-\n\nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution\n\nor Laws of any  State notwithstanding.\"  U.S. Const. art.

Liggett Group,  Inc., 112 S.  Ct. 2608 (1992).   In\n                                  \n\nCipollone,  a  victim  of  lung  cancer  sued  several  cigarette\n         \n\nmanufacturers for  breach  of warranties  contained in  cigarette\n\nadvertisements,  for failure to warn of health hazards related to\n\n                               -6-\n\nsmoking, for  fraudulently misrepresenting  those hazards  to the\n\npublic, and  for conspiracy  to deprive  the public  of important\n\nhealth information.   Id. at  2613.  The  cigarette manufacturers\n                         \n\ncontended that petitioner's claims  were preempted by the federal\n\nlaw  requiring  a  health  warning  to  appear on  all  cigarette\n\nadvertisements and containers.2  Id. at 2614.\n                                    \n\n          In analyzing  preemption, the Court relied  only on the\n\nspecific  language of  the provision  regarding preemption.   The\n\nCourt reasoned that \"Congress'  enactment of a provision defining\n\nthe  preemptive reach  of a statute  implies that  matters beyond\n\nthat reach  are not preempted.\"   Id. at 2618.   The opinion thus\n                                     \n\nanalyzed  each of  petitioner's  claims in  light of  the express\n\nlanguage  of the  preemption provision  in the  cigarette warning\n\nstatute.\n\n          The plurality held that the provision preempted failure\n\nto warn claims as to advertising practices, but not as to testing\n\nor research practices.   Id. at 2621-22.  The  plurality reasoned\n                            \n\nthat  the  Act only  preempted state  law  claims arising  out of\n\ncigarette advertising and promotion, and that appellant's  claims\n\narising out of testing and research did not relate to advertising\n\nand promotion.  The  provision preempted petitioner's  fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation  claim  that cigarette  advertising neutralized\n\n                    \n\n2  That law stated that \"[n]o requirement or prohibition based on\nsmoking or health shall  be imposed under State law  with respect\nto the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of\nwhich are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\"\nFederal Cigarette Labeling and  Advertising Act of 1965,    5, as\namended by Public Health  Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969,    2, 15\nU.S.C.   1334.\n\n                               -7-\n\nthe effect of the warning in a similar fashion.

Id.\n                        \n\n          The plurality  further held that the  provision did not\n\npreempt express  warranty claims, because those  claims arose due\n\nto  the conduct  of  the manufacturers  who  made the  warranties\n\nrather than from state law.  Id. at 2622.  Finally, the plurality\n                                \n\nheld that the provision did not preempt the conspiracy to deprive\n\nthe public of material  facts claims, because they did  not arise\n\nout of state  law pertaining  to smoking and  health, but  rather\n\narose out of a  \"duty not to conspire  to commit fraud.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n2624.\n\n          The analysis  of the plurality in  Cipollone guides our\n                                                      \n\nanalysis  in this  case.   We  begin by  noting that  the express\n\npreemption provision  in the  MDA, 21  U.S.C.    360k, forecloses\n\ninquiry into  implied preemption, because the  fact that Congress\n\nincluded it in the MDA implies that matters beyond its  reach are\n\nnot preempted.   Further, we  note that  the Cipollone  plurality\n                                                      \n\ncarefully construed the preemption provision to extend no further\n\nthan its language warranted.   In doing so, the  plurality sought\n\nto pay proper respect  to federal-state relations.  This  concern\n\narises  out of \"the assumption that the historic police powers of\n\nthe states [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless\n\n                               -8-\n\nthat  [is]   the  clear   and  manifest  purpose   of  Congress.\"\n\nCipollone, 112 S. Ct. at 2617 (citing Rice, 331 U.S. at 230).  We\n                                          \n\ntoo  will carefully construe the preemption  provision of the MDA\n\nto give due regard to questions of federal-state relations.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Bearing  these  principles  in  mind, we  turn  to  the\n\nlanguage of the statute in question.  The MDA states that \n\n            (a) Except as provided in  subsection (b)\n            of  this section,  no State  or political\n            subdivision of  a State may  establish or\n            continue  in  effect  with  respect  to a\n            device   intended   for  human   use  any\n            requirement--\n\n            (1)   which  is  different  from,  or  in\n            addition  to, any  requirement applicable\n            under this chapter to the device, and \n\n            (2)  which  relates   to  the  safety  or\n            effectiveness of  the  device or  to  any\n            other  matter  included in  a requirement\n            applicable  to  the  device   under  this\n            chapter.\n\n21 U.S.C.    360k.  Under subsection  (b) of   360k, a  state may\n\npetition  the  FDA  in   certain  circumstances  to  allow  state\n\nrequirements to  continue  in force.   Because  no such  petition\n\naffects this  case, we  are concerned  only  with the  preemptive\n\neffect  of  subsection  (a).    Under  subsection  (a),  we  must\n\ndetermine whether appellant's products liability claims give rise\n\nto  state law requirements in addition to or different from those\n\nmandated by the FDA.\n\n          We  turn  first  to  the  FDA's  own  understanding  of\n\nsubsection (a) for guidance.

Any state requirement\n\nwhich, in  effect, establishes a new  substantive requirement for\n\nthe  device in a regulated  area such as  labeling, is preempted.\n\n21  C.F.R.    808.1(d)(6)(ii).

Strict Liability\n                              \n\n          Appellant  contends  that  Zyderm  is  unsafe  for  its\n\nintended purpose  and unreasonably  dangerous to users,  and that\n\nCollagen  therefore is liable for any  injuries Zyderm may cause.\n\nIndeed, class III devices such as Zyderm are those that present a\n\n\"potential  unreasonable risk  of  illness or  injury\" such  that\n\nextensive regulation  is required to ensure  reasonably safe use.\n\n21 U.S.C.   360c(a)(1)(C).   The FDA must evaluate  these devices\n\nwith regard to those for  whose use the device is intended.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\n  360c(a)(2)(A).    The entire  MDA  scheme  for such  Class  III\n\ndevices  as  Zyderm,  therefore,  is  aimed  at  determining  and\n\nregulating  the intended purpose of the device, and at ensuring a\n\nreasonable level of safety for its users.\n\n          It  is clear  that appellant's  strict liability  claim\n\nwould impose requirements related to the safety and effectiveness\n\nof  Zyderm.  If successful,  the claim would  require Collagen to\n\nredesign  Zyderm, remove  it from  the market,  or be  subject to\n\nstrict liability.   The MDA  does not permit  this.   Appellant's\n\n                               -11-\n\nclaim  would  force us  to determine  that  Zyderm is  unsafe and\n\ndangerous, in  opposition to  the contrary determination  made by\n\nthe  FDA under the MDA.  Subsection (a) protects manufacturers of\n\nmedical devices approved by the FDA under the MDA from such state\n\nlaw intrusion.\n\n          B.  Breach of Warranty\n                                \n\n          Appellant  claims  that Collagen  breached  express and\n\nimplied  warranties   of  merchantability   and  fitness   for  a\n\nparticular purpose.   Appellant's  express warranty  claims arise\n\nout of  the labeling  and packaging of  Zyderm, all of  which are\n\nregulated  by the FDA.  In labeling and packaging, Collagen could\n\nnot say any  less than what the FDA  required, and appellee could\n\nonly  add   extra  warnings   or  safety  information,   but  not\n\nwarranties, without FDA approval.   Appellant's express  warranty\n\nclaims therefore  are preempted because any  such warranties only\n\ncould  arise  out of  the  FDA-approved  labeling and  packaging.\n\nAllowing  appellant's express  warranty claims  effectively would\n\nimpose additional or different requirements on  Zyderm's labeling\n\nand packaging.\n\n          We  note that  the Court's  holding in  Cipollone would\n                                                           \n\nseem to require the opposite result  in this case.  However,  the\n\nwarnings at issue  in Cipollone were  different than those  here.\n                               \n\nIn  Cipollone, the  statute required  cigarette manufacturers  to\n             \n\ninclude  a brief  health  warning in  their advertisements;  this\n\nwarning did not affect cigarette advertisements in any other way.\n\nThe manufacturers  were  free to  make  any claims  they  wished,\n\n                               -12-\n\nincluding express warranties.  Here, however, the MDA has imposed\n\nmuch   more   extensive   regulation  upon   class   III   device\n\nmanufacturers.   The FDA retains rigid  control over the entirety\n\nof  the labeling  and packaging  of class  III  products, largely\n\ndisplacing  the  ability  of  manufacturers  to  make  additional\n\nclaims.  This high level of control contrasts with  the low level\n\nof control in Cipollone, and ensures  that manufacturers will not\n                       \n\nbe held liable for packaging and labeling imposed by the FDA.\n\n          Appellant  also  alleges   that  Collagen  breached  an\n\nimplied warranty of merchantability,  and that this breach caused\n\nher injuries.   As an implied  warranty is  a requirement upon  a\n\nproduct  that  arises exclusively  from  the  operation of  state\n\ncontract  law,  this claim  is  preempted expressly  by  the MDA.\n\nOtherwise,  it would  impose  a requirement  additional to  those\n\nimposed under the MDA.\n\n          C.  Negligence\n                        \n\n          Appellant's  third  claim  alleges  negligence  in  the\n\ndesign, manufacture,  marketing and sale  of Zyderm.   This claim\n\nalso is preempted by the  MDA.  If the MDA does nothing  else, it\n\nregulates the  design, manufacture,  sale and marketing  of class\n\nIII medical  devices in  an extensive  way.   The  MDA does  this\n\nthrough the  packaging and  labeling requirements  which directly\n\naffect  the  marketing  and  sale  of  the  product.    The  same\n\nrequirements  also  affect  the  design and  manufacture  of  the\n\nproduct in that these processes  must be approved by the FDA  and\n\ndescribed in the product's packaging and labeling.\n\n                               -13-\n\n          As  the  design,  manufacture, marketing  and  sale  of\n\nZyderm  is the subject of FDA regulation, the negligence claim is\n\npreempted.    Otherwise,  a  finding of  negligence  would  force\n\nCollagen  to alter  these aspects  of Zyderm  in response  to the\n\nfinding  of liability, or be subject to liability.  Either result\n\nimpermissibly would  impose  an  additional  or  different  state\n\nrequirement upon  the design, manufacture, marketing  and sale of\n\nZyderm.\n\n          D.  Product Misbranding, Misrepresentation &amp; Failure to\n                                                                 \n              Warn\n                  \n\n          Appellant  contends  that   Zyderm  was  misbranded  or\n\nmislabeled.  Misbranding generally occurs when labeling is \"false\n\nor misleading\"  in any particular. 31 U.S.C.   352(a).  Under the\n\nMDA, the FDA must  reject proposed labeling when the  labeling is\n\n\"false or misleading  in any particular.\"   Id.    360e(d)(2)(D).\n                                               \n\nAs  there  is  no  indication  in  the  record  that  the  Zyderm\n\nadministered  to Ms. King was anything  but what the FDA-approved\n\nlabeling  said it  would  be,  notwithstanding  appellant's  bald\n\nstatements, we find this claim preempted.\n\n          Appellant's fifth and sixth claims of misrepresentation\n\nand failure to warn are preempted for similar reasons.  A finding\n\nthat Collagen  misrepresented Zyderm to appellant  would impose a\n\nrequirement on  Collagen to change  its packaging or  labeling in\n\norder to  correct the  misrepresentation.   The  failure to  warn\n\nclaims similarly challenge the adequacy of Zyderm's FDA-regulated\n\npackaging and labeling.  The MDA forecloses these  claims because\n\nCollagen  cannot  be  forced  to change  Zyderm's  packaging  and\n\n                               -14-\n\nlabeling by virtue of these state law damage claims.\n\n          E.  Fraud\n                   \n\n          Appellant's final cause of action alleges that Collagen\n\nfraudulently obtained  FDA approval at the  premarketing stage of\n\nthe MDA  process, and asks for  treble damages due to  the fraud.\n\nThis cause  of action is  more unclear than  her other  causes of\n\naction.  Collagen  insists that  the claim  originally was  based\n\nupon Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 231,    85J, an antifraud  statute, while\n\nappellant urges that  it was based on a more  general duty not to\n\ndeceive.\n\n          Section 85J  provides  that \"[w]hoever,  by  deceit  or\n\nfraud,  sells  personal property  shall be  liable  in tort  to a\n\npurchaser in treble the amount of damages sustained by him.\"  The\n\nlanguage of this statute corresponds to Ms. King's fraud claim in\n\nproviding for treble damages.  Because Ms. King has not specified\n\nany  applicable statute, or other  reason why she  is entitled to\n\ntreble  damages  under a  general duty  not  to deceive,  we must\n\nconclude that  the fraud claim originally arose under   85J.  The\n\ndistrict  court made the same finding in its memorandum and order\n\nin this case.\n\n          To state a claim  for fraud under   85J,  the plaintiff\n\nmust be in  privity with  the seller.   Kourouvacilis v.  General\n                                                                 \n\nMotors Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101352\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101352/kourouvacilis-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101352\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101352/kourouvacilis-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (1991).  In this\n            \n\ncase,  no  privity existed  between  appellant  and Collagen,  as\n\nCollagen only sold its product directly to appellant's physician.\n\nThus, as a  matter of Massachusetts law, appellant's  fraud claim\n\n                               -15-\n\nmust fail.\n\n          We further note that  the fraud claim is, at  bottom, a\n\nfailure to warn claim.  It seeks to show that Collagen had a duty\n\nto  provide  different  information  in  Zyderm's  packaging  and\n\nlabeling than that which was  approved by the FDA.  As  such, the\n\nclaim is preempted expressly by the MDA.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Because  we  have  determined that  the  MDA  expressly\n\npreempts  Ms. King's state law  tort claims, the  judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                                            \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n                               -15-\n\n            ALDRICH,  Senior Circuit Judge, with whom CAMPBELL,\n                                          \n\n  Senior Circuit Judge, joins, concurring.  While we agree with\n                      \n\n  our brother Torruella's result, and a good deal that he says,\n\n  we approach this case somewhat differently.  First, a  matter\n\n  of  housekeeping.   On  December 13,  1991,  a year  past the\n\n  scheduled  date for  completion of  the pleadings,  plaintiff\n\n  filed a motion  to allow an amended complaint, accompanied by\n\n  the complaint.  On  December 17 she wrote defendant  that she\n\n  would withdraw  her motion.  Defendant,  accordingly, did not\n\n  oppose.  On December 27 defendant moved for summary judgment.\n\n  In opposing defendant's motion for judgment plaintiff made no\n\n  mention  of the proposed new complaint, but, in fact, she did\n\n  not withdraw  her motion,  and  the court  later allowed  it.\n\n  However, the court's ultimate order granting summary judgment\n\n  did not mention the amendment.\n\n            At first  blush  we might  agree  with  defendant's\n\n  objection  that  there  were  substantive  additions  in  the\n\n  amended  complaint,  particularly  with  relation  to  fraud.\n\n  Apart from fraud, the rest of  the amended complaint contains\n\n  six  claims as  against,  originally, two  -- negligence  and\n\n  breach of implied warranty.  There was definitely a purported\n\n  enlargement  -- a state tort of strict liability, and a claim\n\n  of express warranty.  While the negligence alleged is limited\n\n  to designing and producing a dangerous product, and  not that\n\n  the sample sold  plaintiff was  in some way  a departure  and\n\n                               -16-\n\n  individually  defective,  plaintiff   adds  mislabeling   and\n\n  misrepresentation, and, finally, failure to warn.\n\n            Taking defendant's now alleged seven sins, we group\n\n  them  as  follows.    Strict  liability  (negligent  design),\n\n  implied warranty,  negligence,  mislabeling, and  failure  to\n\n  warn are really all  of a piece --  failure to warn.   On the\n\n  record  it is clear  that had there  been a warning  that the\n\n  product  might  cause the  disease  that  plaintiff allegedly\n\n  suffered she would have no claim under any of these headings.\n\n  On  this basis  there  is thus  no  real enlargement  by  the\n\n  amended  complaint.   Express warranty might  be enlargement,\n\n  but  there is no basis for  claiming it.3  Finally, fraud and\n\n  misrepresentation  are  not  as   newly  put  as  they  look.\n\n  Defendant would have it  that the original allegation related\n\n  only  to representations  made to  the plaintiff.   Plaintiff\n\n  states   that   she   intended   her   language  to   include\n\n  misrepresentations  to  the  agency.   Two  of  her  exhibits\n\n  seeking  to raise an issue on the motion for summary judgment\n\n  bear  this  out.    The  amendment   should  stand,  as  mere\n\n  clarification.  However, we read fraud more broadly than does\n\n  our brother, and shall return to it later.\n\n            All agree  that there is one basic  issue:  federal\n\n  preemption.   Preemption may apply against  state judicial as\n\n                      \n\n  3.  Express  warranty might  have created  a problem  for the\n  defense of preemption, cf.  Cipollone v.

It\n            recognizes, too, the need  for regulation\n            to  assure that  the public  is protected\n            and  that  health professionals  can have\n            more  confidence  in  the performance  of\n            devices.

Such amendments should be made\n            in   an   expedited   fashion   so   that\n            appropriate   changes   can  be   rapidly\n            implemented.      The  purpose   of  this\n            authority  is to  permit new  or improved\n            devices to  be marketed without  delay so\n            that the public may have  such beneficial\n            devices  available to  them  as  soon  as\n            possible.  [1083]\n\n            Translating this  into a simple concept, and taking\n\n  the difference of  opinion between the parties  to be whether\n\n  the FDA  requirements are merely  minimum, or  are the  total\n\n  maximum protection afforded  the individual user, we  believe\n\n  this  a clear  demonstration of  Congressional choice  of the\n\n  latter.   We  further find  that the  comprehensive statutory\n\n  language conforms thereto.\n\n            21 U.S.C.   360e(c)(1) provides,\n\n                 (1)   Any person  may file  with the\n            Secretary  an  application for  premarket\n            approval for a class III device.

As all but  one of  plaintiff's\n\n  sustainable  claims  are  premised  on  a  failure  to  warn,\n\n  preemption here  is  unavoidable, given  the  subsection  (F)\n\n  requirement that labels be reviewed by the FDA.\n\n            It follows that  most of plaintiff's  arguments are\n\n  beside  the  mark.   A  few,  however,  may deserve  mention.\n\n  Plaintiff claims  that because of the  regulation reported in\n\n  21  C.F.R. 814.39(d)(1),  to the  effect that  a manufacturer\n\n  \"may,\"  without  prior approval,  make  certain  changes that\n\n  enhance safety, defendant  had a duty to make such  here.  It\n\n  is  sufficient to  say that  to interpret  \"may\"  as \"should\"\n\n  would unravel the entire garment.

As  in the  original complaint,  plaintiff  sought treble\n  damages.    Though  not  mentioned,  presumably  this  demand\n  invoked Mass.
