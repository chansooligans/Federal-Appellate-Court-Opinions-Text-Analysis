Defendants'  summary\n\njudgment motion was unopposed.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          CTI,  a  Puerto   Rico  corporation  controlled  by\n\nSulsona  and Ramirez,  acquired  the stock  of Libreria  Alma\n\nMater,  Inc. (\"Alma  Mater\"),  a corporation  engaged in  the\n\nwholesale and retail  distribution of textbooks.   Plaintiffs\n\nalso engaged in negotiations with defendants for the purchase\n\nof two other corporations engaged in the publication and sale\n\nof  textbooks,  Librotex,  Inc.  (\"Librotex\")  and  Editorial\n\nLibrotex,  Inc. (\"Editorial  Librotex\").   When  the sale  of\n\nLibrotex  and  Editorial  Librotex  fell  through, plaintiffs\n\nbrought suit for alleged  violations of \"the Securities Act,\"\n\n\"the  Securities  and   Exchange  Act,\"   and  \"the   Uniform\n\nSecurity's  [sic] Laws  of Puerto  Rico,\" and  sought further\n\nrelief under Puerto Rico tort and contract laws.   Plaintiffs\n\nalleged that they were  fraudulently induced to purchase Alma\n\n                             -2-\n\nMater's stock  by defendants' promise to  sell plaintiffs the\n\nstock of the other two publishing companies.\n\n          Plaintiffs  moved  for  partial  summary  judgment,\n\nwhich motion was  opposed by defendants  on the grounds  that\n\nplaintiffs'  motion  failed to:    (1)  \"present an  adequate\n\nstatement of  the relevant substantive  law to be  applied to\n\nthe  facts of  this case;\"  and (2)  \"comply with  Local Rule\n\n311.2  which  in  its  pertinent   portion  establishes  that\n\n`motions shall  be accompanied by a brief which shall contain\n\na  concise statement of reasons in support of the motion, and\n\ncitations of authorities upon which the movant relies.'\"  The\n\ndistrict  court agreed  and  struck  plaintiffs'  motion  for\n\nsummary judgment from the record.\n\n          Defendants  moved  for  summary  judgment   on  the\n\ngrounds that:  (1) \"the Security Act, 15 USCA  77[q](a), does\n\nnot provide a private cause of  action for fraud in the  sale\n\nof  securities;\"  (2) \"the  Security  Exchange  Act, 15  USCA\n\n 78(j)(b), [17] CFR  [240], Rule 10[]b[][-][]5,  fraud action\n\nis limited to the  actual sale or purchase of securities.  No\n\nprivate  action is provided in  cases where an  offer to sale\n\n[sic]  stocks is not consummated.  In this case, the offer to\n\nsell Librotex and Editorial [Librotex]  was not consummated;\"\n\nand (3) there were, in any event, no facts  that a reasonable\n\njury  could find to support  the contention that  the sale of\n\nAlma Mater was fraudulently induced by promises that the sale\n\n                             -3-\n\nof  Librotex  and  Editorial  Librotex would  closely  follow\n\nplaintiffs' purchase of Alma Mater.\n\n          On June 16, 1992, when plaintiffs failed to respond\n\nto defendants'  summary judgment  motion,  after having  been\n\ngranted two extensions of time in  which to do so, the  court\n\ndeemed  defendants' motion  to  be unopposed.   Despite  that\n\nruling,  plaintiffs filed a response on July 10 in which they\n\nclaimed that their complaint relied not only on section 17 of\n\nthe Securities Act of 1933,  but also on sections 12 and  15.\n\nThe  district  court  disregarded  the  plaintiffs'  untimely\n\nresponse.\n\n          The   district   court   agreed  with   defendants'\n\ncharacterization of the complaint, and, in an order issued on\n\nJuly 31, held that:  (1) there is no implied private right of\n\naction in section  17(a) of  the Securities Act  of 1933,  15\n\nU.S.C.   77q(a);  and (2) plaintiffs  lacked standing to  sue\n\nunder Rule 10b-5 because  plaintiffs were not \"purchasers\" of\n\neither  Librotex  or  Editorial  Librotex.    After  granting\n\nsummary judgment, the court dismissed the pendent Puerto Rico\n\nlaw  claims, and  awarded costs  and  attorney's fees  on the\n\nground that plaintiffs  had failed to file  a timely response\n\nto defendants' summary judgment motion.\n\n          The  court subsequently  ordered plaintiffs  to pay\n\ncosts  in the  amount  of $3,425.01,  but denied  defendants'\n\nmotion  for attorney's fees in  the amount of $28,745 because\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe submitted bill was  neither sufficiently detailed nor was\n\nit  prepared  contemporaneously  with  the   work  performed.\n\nDefendants filed  a motion  for reconsideration of  the order\n\ndenying  the award of attorney's fees and to amend the motion\n\nfor attorney's fees.   The record does  not indicate whether,\n\nwhen or how the district court disposed of that motion.\n\n          Plaintiffs  appeal  the district  court's  grant of\n\nsummary  judgment,  dismissal  of  pendent  Puerto  Rico  law\n\nclaims, and the award of attorney's fees.\n\n                             II.\n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          Review  of  a  summary judgment  order  places this\n\ncourt on  a well-worn and familiar  path.  Rule  56(c) of the\n\nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  provides  that  summary\n\njudgment  is  appropriate  \"if  the  pleadings,  depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on  file, together\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\n\nissue as to any  material fact and  that the moving party  is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of  law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).  Interpreting this rule, the Supreme Court held that\n\n          the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates\n          the  entry  of  summary  judgment,  after\n          adequate  time  for  discovery  and  upon\n          motion, against a party who fails to make\n          a  showing  sufficient  to establish  the\n          existence of an element essential to that\n          party's  case, and  on  which that  party\n          will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n\n                             -5-\n\nCelotex Corp. v.  Catrett, 477  U.S. 317, 322  (1986).   Rule\n                         \n\n56(e) provides that\n\n          [w]hen a  motion for summary  judgment is\n          made  and supported  as provided  in this\n          rule,  an adverse party may not rest upon\n          the  mere allegations  or denials  of the\n          adverse   party's   pleadings,  but   the\n          adverse party's response  must set  forth\n          specific  facts showing  that there  is a\n          genuine issue for trial.  If the  adverse\n          party  does  not   so  respond,   summary\n          judgment,   if   appropriate,  shall   be\n          entered against the adverse party.\n\nFed. R. Civ.

Local  Rule 311.12  of the  United States  District\n\nCourt for  the District of Puerto Rico  provides, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n             Upon any motion for  summary judgment,\n          there  shall be served  and filed annexed\n          to  the motion  a  separate,  short,  and\n          concise statement of  the material  facts\n\n                             -6-\n\n          as  to  which the  moving  party contends\n          there is no genuine issue to be tried and\n          the  basis of such  contention as to each\n          material  fact,   properly  supported  by\n          specific reference to the record. \n             All  material facts  set forth  in the\n                                                   \n          statement  required to  be served  by the\n                                                   \n          moving  party   will  be  deemed   to  be\n                                                   \n          admitted   unless  controverted   by  the\n                                                   \n          statement  required to  be served  by the\n                                                   \n          opposing party.\n                        \n\n(Emphasis  supplied.)

Garside, 895 F.2d  at 48.  On this appeal, we\n                       \n\nread  the  record  in   the  light  most  favorable   to  the\n\nplaintiffs,  with  the  exception  of  those  material  facts\n\nasserted by  defendants in support of  their summary judgment\n\nmotion  which facts  were  admitted by  plaintiffs when  they\n\nfailed to  timely respond  to defendants' motion  for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                             -7-\n\n                             III.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          Based on  defendants' recitation of  material facts\n\nwhich accompanied their motion  for summary judgment, and the\n\nrest of  the record  before it,  the district  court properly\n\ngranted  summary   judgment  as  to  plaintiffs'   claims  of\n\nsecurities  fraud.    The   district  court  found  that  the\n\nfollowing evidence was uncontested:\n\n             1.   The  offer to  sell the  stock of\n          Librotex   and  Editorial   Librotex  was\n          limited  to those  two companies  and was\n          independent of the sale of Alma Mater.\n             2.    Plaintiffs   have  admitted   on\n          several  different   occasions  that  the\n          purchase   of   Librotex  and   Editorial\n          Librotex  was   not  consummated  because\n          plaintiffs   lacked   the  financing   to\n          purchase the two companies.\n             3.  In the agreement which consummated\n          the  sale of Alma Mater to plaintiffs, no\n          representation  was  made  by  defendants\n          regarding the future sale of Librotex and\n          Editorial Librotex; in fact, in clause 17\n          of  the  agreement,  the  parties  stated\n          without   limitation    that   no   other\n          agreements  existed  between  them as  of\n          that date.\n\n          The   court  reached  these  conclusions  based  on\n\ndocumentary  evidence provided  by defendants  in support  of\n\ntheir   motion  for   summary   judgment.     That   evidence\n\ndemonstrated that the  Alma Mater transaction was  completely\n\nindependent of any contemplated sale of Librotex or Editorial\n\nLibrotex.  Defendants' statement of undisputed material facts\n\nwas  adequately supported by defendants' sworn statements and\n\n                             -8-\n\ndeposition  testimony.   Indeed,  at  the  initial scheduling\n\nconference,  the  parties  stipulated  that  the  Alma  Mater\n\nagreement \"embodied  the entire understanding  of the parties\n\nand  that  there  were  no  further  or  other  agreements or\n\nunderstandings  written  or  oral   in  effect  between   the\n\nparties.\"   The Alma Mater agreement  contained no mention of\n\nthe prospective sale of Librotex or Editorial Librotex.\n\n          Plaintiffs offered no facts to  support their claim\n\nthat  defendants falsely represented  to plaintiffs  that the\n\nAlma  Mater  sale was  linked to  the  sales of  Librotex and\n\nEditorial  Librotex.   Therefore  plaintiffs  failed to  meet\n\ntheir  burden to support their  claim as required  by Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P.  56(e).   We see  no reason to  disturb the  district\n\ncourt's findings  of undisputed  facts, and  therefore affirm\n\nthe district  court's grant of  summary judgment.   We  note,\n\nhowever,  that  our  decision  should  not  be  taken  as  an\n\naffirmance of the district court's holding regarding  private\n\nrights of action under section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\n\n1933,  15  U.S.C.    77q(a).   That  issue has  not  yet been\n\ndecided by  either the  Supreme Court or  the First  Circuit.\n\nSee Eichler v.

(\"Librotex\")  and  Editorial\n\nLibrotex,  Inc. (\"Editorial  Librotex\").

In this case, the offer to\n\nsell Librotex and Editorial [Librotex]  was not consummated;\"\n\nand (3) there were, in any event, no facts  that a reasonable\n\njury  could find to support  the contention that  the sale of\n\nAlma Mater was fraudulently induced by promises that the sale\n\n                             -3-\n\nof  Librotex  and  Editorial  Librotex would  closely  follow\n\nplaintiffs' purchase of Alma Mater.\n\n          On June 16, 1992, when plaintiffs failed to respond\n\nto defendants'  summary judgment  motion,  after having  been\n\ngranted two extensions of time in  which to do so, the  court\n\ndeemed  defendants' motion  to  be unopposed.   Despite  that\n\nruling,  plaintiffs filed a response on July 10 in which they\n\nclaimed that their complaint relied not only on section 17 of\n\nthe Securities Act of 1933,  but also on sections 12 and  15.\n\nThe  district  court  disregarded  the  plaintiffs'  untimely\n\nresponse.\n\n          The   district   court   agreed  with   defendants'\n\ncharacterization of the complaint, and, in an order issued on\n\nJuly 31, held that:  (1) there is no implied private right of\n\naction in section  17(a) of  the Securities Act  of 1933,  15\n\nU.S.C.   77q(a);  and (2) plaintiffs  lacked standing to  sue\n\nunder Rule 10b-5 because  plaintiffs were not \"purchasers\" of\n\neither  Librotex  or  Editorial  Librotex.    After  granting\n\nsummary judgment, the court dismissed the pendent Puerto Rico\n\nlaw  claims, and  awarded costs  and  attorney's fees  on the\n\nground that plaintiffs  had failed to file  a timely response\n\nto defendants' summary judgment motion.\n\n          The  court subsequently  ordered plaintiffs  to pay\n\ncosts  in the  amount  of $3,425.01,  but denied  defendants'\n\nmotion  for attorney's fees in  the amount of $28,745 because\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe submitted bill was  neither sufficiently detailed nor was\n\nit  prepared  contemporaneously  with  the   work  performed.\n\nDefendants filed  a motion  for reconsideration of  the order\n\ndenying  the award of attorney's fees and to amend the motion\n\nfor attorney's fees.   The record does  not indicate whether,\n\nwhen or how the district court disposed of that motion.\n\n          Plaintiffs  appeal  the district  court's  grant of\n\nsummary  judgment,  dismissal  of  pendent  Puerto  Rico  law\n\nclaims, and the award of attorney's fees.\n\n                             II.\n\n                      Standard of Review\n                                        \n\n          Review  of  a  summary judgment  order  places this\n\ncourt on  a well-worn and familiar  path.  Rule  56(c) of the\n\nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  provides  that  summary\n\njudgment  is  appropriate  \"if  the  pleadings,  depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on  file, together\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\n\nissue as to any  material fact and  that the moving party  is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of  law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).  Interpreting this rule, the Supreme Court held that\n\n          the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates\n          the  entry  of  summary  judgment,  after\n          adequate  time  for  discovery  and  upon\n          motion, against a party who fails to make\n          a  showing  sufficient  to establish  the\n          existence of an element essential to that\n          party's  case, and  on  which that  party\n          will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n\n                             -5-\n\nCelotex Corp. v.

Plaintiffs   have  admitted   on\n          several  different   occasions  that  the\n          purchase   of   Librotex  and   Editorial\n          Librotex  was   not  consummated  because\n          plaintiffs   lacked   the  financing   to\n          purchase the two companies.\n             3.  In the agreement which consummated\n          the  sale of Alma Mater to plaintiffs, no\n          representation  was  made  by  defendants\n          regarding the future sale of Librotex and\n          Editorial Librotex; in fact, in clause 17\n          of  the  agreement,  the  parties  stated\n          without   limitation    that   no   other\n          agreements  existed  between  them as  of\n          that date.\n\n          The   court  reached  these  conclusions  based  on\n\ndocumentary  evidence provided  by defendants  in support  of\n\ntheir   motion  for   summary   judgment.     That   evidence\n\ndemonstrated that the  Alma Mater transaction was  completely\n\nindependent of any contemplated sale of Librotex or Editorial\n\nLibrotex.  Defendants' statement of undisputed material facts\n\nwas  adequately supported by defendants' sworn statements and\n\n                             -8-\n\ndeposition  testimony.   Indeed,  at  the  initial scheduling\n\nconference,  the  parties  stipulated  that  the  Alma  Mater\n\nagreement \"embodied  the entire understanding  of the parties\n\nand  that  there  were  no  further  or  other  agreements or\n\nunderstandings  written  or  oral   in  effect  between   the\n\nparties.\"   The Alma Mater agreement  contained no mention of\n\nthe prospective sale of Librotex or Editorial Librotex.\n\n          Plaintiffs offered no facts to  support their claim\n\nthat  defendants falsely represented  to plaintiffs  that the\n\nAlma  Mater  sale was  linked to  the  sales of  Librotex and\n\nEditorial  Librotex.   Therefore  plaintiffs  failed to  meet\n\ntheir  burden to support their  claim as required  by Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P.  56(e).   We see  no reason to  disturb the  district\n\ncourt's findings  of undisputed  facts, and  therefore affirm\n\nthe district  court's grant of  summary judgment.   We  note,\n\nhowever,  that  our  decision  should  not  be  taken  as  an\n\naffirmance of the district court's holding regarding  private\n\nrights of action under section 17(a) of the Securities Act of\n\n1933,  15  U.S.C.    77q(a).   That  issue has  not  yet been\n\ndecided by  either the  Supreme Court or  the First  Circuit.\n\nSee Eichler v.
