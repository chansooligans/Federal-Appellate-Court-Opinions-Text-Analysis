The  appellants' central  claim--that\n\nFederal  Reserve Notes are not  lawful currency and so cannot\n\nbe used  as legal  tender for  private debts--is  frivolous.1\n\nWe likewise find  their subsidiary allegations to  be without\n\nmerit,  substantially for the  reasons cited by  the district\n\ncourt.\n\n     The judgment is  affirmed.
