Raymond J. Pettine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n                                                        \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                     Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                        \n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n                                              \n\n                                        \n\n   Loletta L. Darden on brief for appellant.\n                    \n   Edwin J.  Gale, United  States Attorney, Gerard  B. Sullivan\n                                                               \nand  Margaret E.  Curran, Assistant  United States  Attorneys, on\n                      \nbrief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.    Appellant, Amir Ghaffar, pled guilty\n                    \n\nto the following  three counts: I) possession with  intent to\n\ndistribute  heroin (21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1));  II)  use of  a\n\nfirearm during a drug trafficking crime (18 U.S.C.   924(c));\n\nand III)  possession of  a firearm by  a felon (18  U.S.C.   \n\n922(g)).   The United States District  Court for the District\n\nof  Rhode  Island sentenced  him to  70  months in  prison on\n\ncounts I and III,  to run concurrently, and  to 60 months  in\n\nprison on  count II, to  run consecutively with  the sentence\n\nimposed for counts I and III.  \n\n     Ghaffar  appeals the  sentence on  the grounds  that the\n\nfive-year  consecutive  sentence  mandated  by  18  U.S.C.   \n\n924(c)(1)  violates  his  due process  and  Eighth  Amendment\n\nrights  and that the district court erred in failing to merge\n\ncounts II and III for sentencing purposes.  We affirm.\n\n1.   Due Process and Eighth Amendment Claims\n                                            \n\n     Ghaffar argues on appeal, for  the first time, that  the\n\nimposition of a five-year consecutive sentence mandated by 18\n\nU.S.C.     924(c)(1)  violates  his due  process  rights  and\n\nconstitutes cruel  and unusual  punishment.  Ghaffar  did not\n\nraise  these  constitutional   issues  below,  despite  ample\n\nopportunity  to  do  so.     \"We  have  repeatedly ruled,  in\n\nconnection  with  sentencing  as  in  other   contexts,  that\n\narguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not\n\nbe raised for the first time  in an appellate venue.\"  United\n                                                             \n\n                             -2-\n\nStates v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 1991).  Therefore,\n               \n\nwe deem these constitutional claims to have been waived.\n\n     Even had the claims not been waived, however, they would\n\nnot  entitle Ghaffar  to  relief.      In  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nCampusano,  947  F.2d  1  (1st  Cir.  1991),  we  upheld  the\n         \n\nmandatory sentencing provision of  18 U.S.C.   924(c) against\n\nclaims that  it precluded discretion by  the sentencing court\n\nin violation of appellant's  due process and Eighth Amendment\n\nrights. Id. at 3-4.  \n           \n\n     Here, Ghaffar's  argument is that  the statute  violates\n\ndue  process because it  is not the  \"least restrictive means\n\nfor accomplishing  Congress' purpose.\"   There is  no support\n\nfor  the application  of such  a standard  to the  statute in\n\nquestion.  Ghaffar also  argues that the consecutive sentence\n\nrequirement   of  section   924(c)(1)  violates   the  Eighth\n\nAmendment because it  imposes a penalty that is \"harsher than\n\nnecessary.\"    Even  if  we  liberally  interpret this  as  a\n\nproportionality argument, the mandatory  consecutive sentence\n\nimposed under section 924(c) does not come close to the level\n\nof disproportionality that would constitute cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.  In United  States v. Gilliard, 847 F.2d  21 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1033 (1989), we held that\n                         \n\na minimum  fifteen-year sentence for possession  of a firearm\n\nby an  habitual criminal, imposed  under 18 U.S.C.    924(e),\n\ndid  not  constitute  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.    The\n\n                             -3-\n\nreasoning of that  opinion has equal,  if not greater,  force\n\nhere.\n\n2.   Merger of Counts II and III\n                                \n\n     Ghaffar's second argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt  erred in sentencing him  under count II  (for using or\n\ncarrying   a  firearm  during  or  in   relation  to  a  drug\n\ntrafficking  offense)  and count  III  (for  possession of  a\n\nfirearm by a convicted felon) because both  counts involved a\n\nsingle  act: possession  of a  firearm.  Ghaffar  relies upon\n\nBall  v.  United States,  470 U.S.  856 (1985)  (holding that\n                       \n\nCongress  did not intend  punishments to be  imposed for both\n\nreceipt of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(h)(1) and\n\npossession  of a  firearm  in  violation  of 18  U.S.C.  App.\n\n 1202(a)(1)).  Ghaffar  raised  this  argument  below.    The\n\ndistrict court, after briefing by the parties, rejected it in\n\na  Memorandum and  Order dated  May 14,  1993.   The district\n\ncourt fully  articulated the reasons  that Ghaffar's reliance\n\nupon Ball v. United States is misplaced.  We reject Ghaffar's\n                          \n\nargument  for  the  reasons  stated  in  the  district  court\n\nopinion.\n\n     The sentence imposed by  the district court is summarily\n\naffirmed pursuant to Loc. R. 27.1.\n\n                             -4-\n",
