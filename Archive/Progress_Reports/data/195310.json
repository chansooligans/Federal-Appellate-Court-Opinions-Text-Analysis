McClain on brief pro se.\n                 \nMarc  J. Miller and Bernstein, Golder &amp; Miller,  P.A. on brief for\n                                                     \nappellee Gordon Clark.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Appellant  Donald  McClain  filed an\n                     \n\naction in the district  court under 42 U.S.C.    1983 against\n\nGordon Clark, a correctional officer, and John McGonigle, the\n\nMiddlesex  County  Sheriff.    McClain  alleged  the  use  of\n\nexcessive force  by Clark  in the  process of  moving McClain\n\nfrom the jail in which he  was housed to a van in preparation\n\nfor  transportation to  court.   The  district court  granted\n\nClark's  motion for summary judgment.  In so doing, it relied\n\non Clark's affidavit to find that the force used by Clark was\n\nreasonable and necessary to  fulfill his duties under Whitley\n                                                             \n\nv. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986).\n         \n\n          On appeal,  McClain first  complains that he  never\n\nreceived the  report of a magistrate judge  which had earlier\n\nrecommended  the  denial  of  McClain's  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment.   McClain also states that he was not notified that\n\nthe case  had  been  transferred from  Judge  Wolf  to  Judge\n\nHornby.    In  light  of  the  fact that  McClain  apparently\n\nreceived notice  of Judge  Wolf's adoption of  the magistrate\n\njudge's  recommendation,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  he  was\n\nprejudiced.   Even if he  was deprived of  the opportunity to\n\nfile  objections to  the report,  he essentially  received an\n\nequivalent opportunity when  he responded  to Clark's  motion\n\nfor summary judgment.   That  is, he wrote  a memorandum  and\n\nsubmitted  his  medical records  and  the  affidavits of  two\n\nwitnesses to some of the events in question.\n\n          Second, McClain argues that he met the requirements\n\nfor summary  judgment because  he suffered an  injury to  his\n\nright hand when Clark smashed his  hand by stepping on it and\n\nwhen Clark, in double-handcuffing him, placed the cuffs on so\n\ntightly that circulation  was cut  off to his  hands.   Also,\n\nprison officials allegedly applied excessive force in the way\n\nthey  carried him  to  the van.    McClain asserts  that  the\n\nactions of  the prison officials, especially  Clark, were not\n\nwarranted because  he (McClain)  never presented a  threat to\n\nany officers.\n\n          To  prevail on  a  motion for  summary judgment,  a\n\nmoving party must \"show that there is no genuine  issue as to\n\nany material  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   Once\n\nthe  movant has met this  standard, the burden  shifts to the\n\nnon-moving party to  establish the existence of \"at least one\n\nissue that  is  both `genuine'  and  `material.'\"   Kelly  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States,  924 F.2d 355,  357 (1st Cir.  1991) (citation\n             \n\nomitted);  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(e).    Here, as  Judge Hornby\n\nnoted, McClain did not  file his own affidavit.   However, he\n\ndid  submit  the  affidavits  of the  two  inmates;  he  also\n\nsubmitted medical records.\n\n          To show an Eighth Amendment violation when force is\n\nused, an inmate must  demonstrate \"the unnecessary and wanton\n\ninfliction of pain.\"  See Whitley, 475 U.S. at 320.  That is,\n                                 \n\n                             -3-\n\nthat the  force was not  \"`applied in a good  faith effort to\n\nmaintain or restore discipline [but was used] maliciously and\n\nsadistically  for the very purpose of causing harm.'\"  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n320-21  (quoting Johnson  v. Glick, 481  F.2d 1028,  1033 (2d\n                                  \n\nCir.), cert. denied,  414 U.S. 1033 (1973)).   In considering\n                   \n\nthis  question, courts must take into  account \"the extent of\n\nthe  threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably\n\nperceived  by the responsible  officials on the  basis of the\n\nfacts known to them. . . . \"  Id. at 321.\n                                 \n\n          Upon reviewing the affidavits of the two  prisoners\n\nand  comparing  them  to  Clark's  affidavit,  the  following\n\nundisputed scenario emerges.  There  was an argument in which\n\nMcClain refused  to let the prison officials  prepare him for\n\ntransportation to court  and in which he  denied the requests\n\nthat  he  be voluntarily  handcuffed  as  required by  prison\n\npolicy.  Although one of the inmates asserts in his affidavit\n\nthat McClain \"appeared\" not to be putting  up any resistance,\n\nClark nonetheless  forced McClain onto  a table with  a night\n\nstick.  However, this inmate also states that he (the inmate)\n\nwas taken  out to  the van immediately  after this  occurred.\n\nThus, he did not see, nor  did the other inmate claim to see,\n\nwhat  happened next when Clark  put the leg  irons on McClain\n\nand began patting down McClain.   Because McClain claims that\n\nClark inflicted  the force (smashing his  hand and tightening\n\nthe  handcuffs) during  this period  of time,  we  think that\n\n                             -4-\n\nClark's version of what happened in the course of the ensuing\n\nprocess remains  uncontradicted.  That is,  that McClain, due\n\nto his  resistance and  combativeness, presented a  threat to\n\nClark which required the use of force by Clark.\n\n          Once this is established, the question then becomes\n\nwhether  the   force  employed  was  used   \"maliciously  and\n\nsadistically for  the very  purpose of  causing harm\" or,  as\n\nClark asserts in his  affidavit, in a \"good faith\"  effort to\n\nkeep McClain in  custody and  under control.   \"The focus  of\n\nthis  standard  is  on  the  detention  facility   official's\n\nsubjective  intent to punish.\"  Valencia v. Wiggins, 981 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1440,  1449 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2998 (1993).\n                                    \n\nFurther, the  Whitley Court recognized that  deference should\n                     \n\nbe  accorded  prison  officials  in the  choice  and  use  of\n\npractices they believe  are necessary  to maintain  security.\n\nSee 475 U.S. at 321-22.\n   \n\n          Given the  situation facing Clark  -- that  McClain\n\nhad  to be transported to  court but was  refusing to proceed\n\nvoluntarily  -- Clark  reasonably could  have  perceived that\n\nsome  force   would  be  needed  to   accomplish  this  goal.\n\nMoreover,  once  McClain   became  combative,  and  therefore\n\npotentially  dangerous, one  way to  subdue and  keep McClain\n\nfrom  hurting  others  was  by  the  use  of  leg  irons  and\n\nhandcuffs.  In the  absence of any evidence to  the contrary,\n\nClark's  assertion that, based on  the facts then before him,\n\n                             -5-\n\nhe  acted in good faith during  this process must be taken as\n\ntrue.  See Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321.\n                  \n\n          Because  the use  of  force in  this  case was  not\n\nconstitutionally  excessive,  the  alleged  injuries  McClain\n\nsuffered become  irrelevant.   We therefore need  not address\n\nMcClain's claim  that Clark  committed perjury by  stating in\n\nhis affidavit that McClain  had not received any \"significant\n\ninjury.\"\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -6-\n",

In considering this question, courts must take into account \"the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them....  \" Id. at 321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reviewing the affidavits of the two prisoners and comparing them to Clark's affidavit, the following undisputed scenario emerges.  There was an argument in which McClain refused to let the prison officials prepare him for transportation to court and in which he denied the requests that he be voluntarily handcuffed as required by prison policy.  Although one of the inmates asserts in his affidavit that McClain \"appeared\" not to be putting up any resistance, Clark nonetheless forced McClain onto a table with a night stick.  However, this inmate also states that he (the inmate) was taken out to the van immediately after this occurred.  Thus, he did not see, nor did the other inmate claim to see, what happened next when Clark put the leg irons on McClain and began patting down McClain.  Because McClain claims that Clark inflicted the force (smashing his hand and tightening the handcuffs) during this period of time, we think that Clark's version of what happened in the course of the ensuing process remains uncontradicted.  That is, that McClain, due to his resistance and combativeness, presented a threat to Clark which required the use of force by Clark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once this is established, the question then becomes whether the force employed was used \"maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm\" or, as Clark asserts in his affidavit, in a \"good faith\" effort to keep McClain in custody and under control.  \"The focus of this standard is on the detention facility official's subjective intent to punish.\"   Valencia v. Wiggins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597117\"><a href=\"/opinion/597117/raul-jose-valencia-v-garry-d-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1440</span></a></span>, 1449 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, the Whitley Court recognized that deference should be accorded prison officials in the choice and use of practices they believe are necessary to maintain security.  See 475 U.S. at 321-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the situation facing Clark-that McClain had to be transported to court but was refusing to proceed voluntarily-Clark reasonably could have perceived that some force would be needed to accomplish this goal.  Moreover, once McClain became combative, and therefore potentially dangerous, one way to subdue and keep McClain from hurting others was by the use of leg irons and handcuffs.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, Clark's assertion that, based on the facts then before him, he acted in good faith during this process must be taken as true.   See Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the use of force in this case was not constitutionally excessive, the alleged injuries McClain suffered become irrelevant.  We therefore need not address McClain's claim that Clark committed perjury by stating in his affidavit that McClain had not received any \"significant injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
