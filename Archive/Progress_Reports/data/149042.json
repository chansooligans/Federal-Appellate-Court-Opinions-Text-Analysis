Petitioner Maynor Alonso Larios\n\n(Larios) is a native and citizen of Guatemala.    He seeks review of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals'(BIA) final order, affirming\n\nwithout opinion the Immigration Judge's (IJ) decision denying     his\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Limiting his appeal to\n\nthe asylum issue, Larios argues that the BIA violated his due\n\nprocess rights by summarily affirming a decision in which the IJ\n\nallegedly failed to consider all of his claims for relief.    For the\n\nreasons that follow, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n            Larios first arrived in the United States on or about July\n\n29, 2005.     He was fourteen years old.   On September 2, 2005, the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a Notice to Appear (NTA)\n\nwith the immigration court, commencing removal proceedings against\n\nLarios.     DHS maintained that Larios was subject to removal under\n\n§ 212(a)(6)(A)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(I), as an alien present in the United States\n\nwithout admission or parole.1      In his \"Respondent's Pleadings,\"\n\n     1\n      § 212(a)(6)(A)(i)of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (a)(6)(A)(i),\nstates the following:\n     (a) Classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission\n     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are\ninadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to\nreceive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United\nStates:\n\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fdated August 9, 2006, Larios, through counsel, admitted the truth\n\nof the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability.          On June\n\n27, 2006, Larios submitted his application for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under CAT.        After an evidentiary hearing\n\nheld on October 1, 2008, the IJ issued an oral decision denying\n\nLarios's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT\n\nclaims.   Finding Larios ineligible for relief because he failed to\n\nestablish that he faced future persecution on account of a protected\n\nground, the IJ ordered Larios removed to Guatemala.2        On appeal to\n\nthe BIA, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without issuing a\n\nseparate opinion.     This petition for review followed.\n\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           In   immigration   cases,    we   review   findings   of   fact,\n\nincluding credibility determinations, under the highly deferential\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard.       Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2005).    Accordingly, we must affirm the findings upon\n\nwhich the decision is based if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\n\n\n          (6) Illegal entrants and immigration violators\n           (A) Aliens present without admission or parole\n               (i) In general\n     An alien in the United States without being admitted or\nparoled, or who arrives in the United States at any time or place\nother than as designated by the Attorney General, is\ninadmissible.\n     2\n      The IJ also found that Larios was ineligible for voluntary\ndeparture because Larios, through counsel, had waived this remedy\nat the beginning of the hearing.\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\" I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).                This\n\nmeans that the findings must stand unless the record evidence is\n\nsuch as to compel a reasonable fact-finder to make a contrary\n\ndetermination.     Olujoke,    411   F.3d   at   21;   see   also   8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B).     We review the agency's legal interpretations de\n\nnovo, subject to appropriate principles of administrative deference.\n\nSee Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2006).                 We also\n\nreview de novo whether immigration procedures comport with due\n\nprocess.   Walker v. Holder, 589 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Where   the   BIA   summarily     affirms    the    IJ's      asylum\n\ndetermination, as is the case here, we review the IJ's decision as\n\nif it were the decision of the BIA.         Olujoke, 411 F.3d at 21; see\n\nalso Albathani v. I.N.S., 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003)(quoting\n\nGao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d       266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002)(\"Ordinarily,\n\nCourts of Appeals review decisions of the [BIA], and not those of\n\nan IJ.   When the BIA does not render its own opinion, however, and\n\neither defers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of\n\nAppeals must then review the decision of the IJ.\")).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nLarios's Arguments\n\n           While Larios's brief is far from a paragon of clarity, he\n\nseems to be arguing two separate points. First, he contends--though\n\nvaguely at best--that the affirmance without opinion (AWO) procedure\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\fin and of itself is constitutionally infirm.                        Consequently, the\n\nGovernment addressed the issue in its reply brief.                     Second, Larios\n\nargues that the BIA's use of the AWO procedure in this instance\n\nviolated his due process rights because the IJ allegedly failed to\n\nconsider    all   the   grounds    for     relief          raised    by     him.      More\n\nspecifically, Larios claims that even though the IJ made findings\n\nas to the particular social group of youth resistant to gangs, the\n\nIJ failed to specifically address Larios's claim that if deported,\n\nLarios would be a street child.                  We        will discuss these two\n\narguments    sequentially.        We     begin      by     addressing       briefly    the\n\nconstitutionality of the AWO procedure.\n\nAWO Procedure\n\n            As a general matter, we have held time and time again that\n\nthe AWO procedure constitutes \"a valid exercise of the Attorney\n\nGeneral's    discretion    to   fashion     its       own    rules    of    procedure.\"\n\nMekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nAlbathani,    318   F.3d   at     377.         As     we    stated     in    Albathani,\n\n\"promulgation of the AWO regulations is within the power of the\n\n[DHS].\" 318 F.3d at 377.        That being so, the BIA can adopt, without\n\nfurther explanation, the IJ's opinion.                Id.    Where the BIA affirms\n\nwithout opinion the decision of the IJ, the IJ's decision becomes\n\nthe final agency decision for purposes of this Court's review.                         See\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(ii).        Accordingly, any suggestion by Larios\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 5 -\n\fthat the AWO procedure in and of itself violates his due process\n\nrights is without merit.\n\nAsylum Claim\n\n          Larios's claim for asylum turns on his contention that he\n\nhas a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership\n\nwithin two particular social groups: the first group comprised of\n\nyoung Guatemalan men recruited by gang members who resist such\n\nrecruitment and the second group comprised of street children.3\n\nLarios alleges the IJ failed to adequately consider both grounds for\n\nasylum relief, thus depriving him of due process.\n\n          As an initial matter, the burden of proof for establishing\n\neligibility for asylum falls on the petitioner.       See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(a). The applicant must show that he or she is a refugee\n\nwithin the meaning of the immigration laws.    Olujoke, 411 F.3d at\n\n21; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a). \"A refugee\n\nis a person who cannot or will not return to [his or] her home\n\ncountry 'because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\n[future] persecution on account of     race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\"\n\nOlujoke, 411 F.3d at 21; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In proceedings before the IJ, Larios never alleged that he\nhad been a victim of past persecution, so we analyze his asylum\nclaim by considering whether he proved a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).\n\n                               - 6 -\n\f          To   prove   persecution   on    account   of   membership   in   a\n\nparticular social group, Larios must show at a bare minimum that he\n\nis a member of a legally cognizable social group.              See Mendez-\n\nBarrera v. Holder, 602 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2010).               The term\n\n\"social group\" is not defined by statute.            However, the BIA has\n\n\"described a social group as a group of persons sharing a common,\n\nimmutable characteristic that makes the group socially visible and\n\nsufficiently particular.\"    Id.   Neither of Larios's proposed social\n\ngroups meets this standard.\n\nYouth Resistant to Gang Recruitment\n\n          As to Larios's first claim, the IJ concluded that Larios,\n\nthough credible, nonetheless failed to establish a well-founded fear\n\nof persecution on account of membership in a particular social\n\ngroup.   Specifically, the IJ found that Larios feared future\n\npersecution at the hands of gang members seeking him out for\n\nrecruitment purposes or retaliating against him for refusing to join\n\ntheir gang.    Nevertheless, the IJ determined that if Larios was\n\nindeed targeted by gangs, the motivation would not be on account of\n\nhis membership in a particular social group but would rather be an\n\nattempt to increase the gang's numbers.       The IJ also found that the\n\ngang members may target Larios under the mistaken belief that\n\nbecause he is returning from the United States, he comes from a\n\nfamily with money.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 7 -\n\f           In support of his findings, we first note that the IJ\n\nproperly applied controlling BIA case law.                   See Matter of S-E-G-,\n\n24 I. & N. Dec. 579 (BIA 2008)(holding that Salvadoran youths who\n\nhave been subjected to recruitment efforts by the MS-13 gang and who\n\nhave resisted membership in the gang do not constitute a particular\n\nsocial   group);   Matter     of     E-A-G-,     24    I.    &    N.   Dec.    591   (BIA\n\n2008)(holding    that    a   young       Honduran     male   failed     to     establish\n\nmembership in particular social group of persons resistant to gang\n\nmembership, as evidence failed to establish that Honduran society,\n\nincluding gang members themselves, would perceive those opposed to\n\ngang membership as members of a social group); see also Matter of\n\nA-M-E- & J-G-U-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 69 (BIA 2007).                     Morever, Larios's\n\nclaim is foreclosed by our recent decision in Mendez-Barrera.\n\nThere, we held that \"young [El Salvadoran] women recruited by gang\n\nmembers who resist such recruitment\" do not constitute a legally\n\ncognizable social group because the proposed group lacks social\n\nvisibility and is not sufficiently particular.                    Mendez-Barrera, 602\n\nF.3d at 27.     In order to satisfy the social visibility criterion,\n\na group \"must be generally recognized in the community as a cohesive\n\ngroup.\" Id. at 26.       Like the petitioner in Mendez-Barrera, Larios\n\nhas \"failed to provide even a scintilla of evidence to this effect.\"\n\nId.   Furthermore,      Larios     has     \"failed     to        pinpoint     any    group\n\ncharacteristics that render members of the putative group socially\n\nvisible in [Guatemala].\"           Id.     Larios's \"proposed group does not\n\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\fsupply   an    adequate   profile   for   establishing   membership,\"   and\n\ntherefore,      \"the   putative     group-[youth    resistant    to     gang\n\nrecruitment]-is not socially visible.\"        Id. at 26-27.\n\n              Additionally, Larios's proposed social group is \"not\n\nsufficiently particular to be legally cognizable.\"          Id. at 27. As\n\nwe stated in Mendez-Barrera,\n\n              it is virtually impossible to identify who is\n              or is not a member. There are, for example,\n              questions about who may be considered \"young,\"\n              the type of conduct that may be considered\n              \"recruit[ment],\" and the degree to which a\n              person must display \"resist[ance].\" These are\n              ambiguous   group   characteristics,    largely\n              subjective, that fail to establish a sufficient\n              level of particularity.\n\nId. (quoting Faye, 580 F.3d at 42). Larios's purported social group\n\nof youth resistant to gang recruitment suffers from these same\n\ninfirmities.      Accordingly, because this putative social group is\n\nneither socially visible nor sufficiently particular, we conclude\n\nthat the IJ did not err in denying Larios's claim for asylum based\n\non Larios's membership in this particular group.\n\nStreet Children\n\n              Larios next argues that the IJ should have considered\n\nevidence that if Larios returned to Guatemala he would have a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution based upon his membership within a\n\nlegally cognizable social group, to wit, \"street children.\"             The\n\nIJ's alleged failure to address this argument, he contends, deprives\n\nhim of due process rights.        However, not once when testifying did\n\n\n                                    - 9 -\n\fLarios ever specifically claim that he would end up as a street\n\nchild. Indeed, when asked if he would end up living on the streets,\n\nhomeless   in   Guatemala,   Larios   conceded   that   he    would   not.\n\nSimilarly, there was no argument made before the IJ as to why Larios\n\nwould even meet the criteria of a \"street child.\"            Consequently,\n\nbecause Larios failed to properly raise this claim before the IJ,\n\nthis argument is deemed waived on appeal.           See Kechichian v.\n\nMukasey, 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding no error in the\n\nBIA's refusal to address claim that had not been properly raised\n\nbefore the IJ).\n\n           In reaching our conclusion we are mindful of the strict\n\nstandards of review by which we are bound.         We do not have the\n\nauthority to grant the petition unless the evidence compels a\n\nconclusion different from that reached by the IJ.        Mejilla-Romero\n\nv. Holder, 600 F.3d 63, 76 (1st Cir. 2010).       On the record before\n\nus, we cannot say that it does.       Substantial evidence exists to\n\nuphold the IJ's determination that Larios's testimony, though\n\ncredible, was not enough to show that he had a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of his membership in a statutorily protected\n\nsocial group.\n\n                              CONCLUSION\n\n           In sum, the IJ's decision to deny Larios's asylum claim\n\nwas   well-reasoned   and    supported   by   controlling       precedent:\n\n\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\fsubstantial evidence exists to uphold the decision of the IJ.   The\n\npetition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                             - 11 -\n\f",

Second, Larios argues that the BIA's use of the AWO procedure in this instance violated his due process rights because the IJ allegedly failed to consider all the grounds for relief raised by him. More specifically, Larios claims that even though the IJ made findings as to the particular social group of youth resistant to gangs, the IJ failed to specifically address Larios's claim that if deported, Larios would be a street child. We will discuss these two arguments sequentially. We begin by addressing briefly the constitutionality of the AWO procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>AWO Procedure</i></h2>\n<p>As a general matter, we have held time and time again that the AWO procedure constitutes \"a valid exercise of the Attorney General's discretion to fashion its own rules of procedure.\" <i>Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> 358 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 377. As we stated in <i>Albathani,</i> \"promulgation of the AWO regulations is within the power of the [DHS].\" 318 F.3d at 377. That being so, the BIA can adopt, without further explanation, the IJ's opinion. <i>Id.</i> Where the BIA affirms without opinion the decision of the IJ, the IJ's decision becomes the final agency decision for purposes of this Court's review. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(ii). Accordingly, any suggestion by Larios that the AWO procedure in and of itself violates his due process rights is without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Asylum Claim</h2>\n<p>Larios's claim for asylum turns on his contention that he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership within two particular social groups: the first group comprised of young Guatemalan men recruited by gang members who resist such recruitment and the second group comprised of street children.<sup>[3]</sup> Larios alleges the IJ failed to adequately consider both grounds for asylum relief, thus depriving him of due process.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the burden of proof for establishing eligibility for asylum falls on the petitioner. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a). The applicant must show that he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration laws. <i>Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 21; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a). \"A refugee is a person who cannot or will not return to [his or] her home country `because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of [future] persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\" <i>Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 21; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p>To prove persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, Larios must show at a bare minimum that he is a member of a legally cognizable social group. <i>See </i><i>Mendez-Barrera v. Holder,</i> 602 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2010). The term \"social group\" is not defined by statute. However, the BIA has \"described a social group as a group of persons sharing a common, immutable characteristic that makes the group socially visible and sufficiently particular.\" <i>Id.</i> Neither of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> Larios's proposed social groups meets this standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Youth Resistant to Gang Recruitment</i></h2>\n<p>As to Larios's first claim, the IJ concluded that Larios, though credible, nonetheless failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group. Specifically, the IJ found that Larios feared future persecution at the hands of gang members seeking him out for recruitment purposes or retaliating against him for refusing to join their gang. Nevertheless, the IJ determined that if Larios was indeed targeted by gangs, the motivation would not be on account of his membership in a particular social group but would rather be an attempt to increase the gang's numbers. The IJ also found that the gang members may target Larios under the mistaken belief that because he is returning from the United States, he comes from a family with money.</p>\n<p>In support of his findings, we first note that the IJ properly applied controlling BIA case law. <i>See </i><i>Matter of S-E-G-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579 (BIA 2008)(holding that Salvadoran youths who have been subjected to recruitment efforts by the MS-13 gang and who have resisted membership in the gang do not constitute a particular social group); <i>Matter of E-A-G-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591 (BIA 2008)(holding that a young Honduran male failed to establish membership in particular social group of persons resistant to gang membership, as evidence failed to establish that Honduran society, including gang members themselves, would perceive those opposed to gang membership as members of a social group); <i>see also </i><i>Matter of A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69 (BIA 2007). Moreover, Larios's claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <i>Mendez-Barrera.</i> There, we held that \"young [El Salvadoran] women recruited by gang members who resist such recruitment\" do not constitute a legally cognizable social group because the proposed group lacks social visibility and is not sufficiently particular. <i>Mendez-Barrera,</i> 602 F.3d at 27. In order to satisfy the social visibility criterion, a group \"must be generally recognized in the community as a cohesive group.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26. Like the petitioner in <i>Mendez-Barrera,</i> Larios has \"failed to provide even a scintilla of evidence to this effect.\" <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, Larios has \"failed to pinpoint any group characteristics that render members of the putative group socially visible in [Guatemala].\" <i>Id.</i> Larios's \"proposed group does not supply an adequate profile for establishing membership,\" and therefore, \"the putative group-[youth resistant to gang recruitment]-is not socially visible.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26-27.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Larios's proposed social group is \"not sufficiently particular to be legally cognizable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. As we stated in <i>Mendez-Barrera,</i></p>\n<blockquote>it is virtually impossible to identify who is or is not a member. There are, for example, questions about who may be considered \"young,\" the type of conduct that may be considered \"recruit[ment],\" and the degree to which a person must display \"resist[ance].\" These are ambiguous group characteristics, largely subjective, that fail to establish a sufficient level of particularity.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Faye,</i> 580 F.3d at 42). Larios's purported social group of youth resistant to gang recruitment suffers from these same infirmities. Accordingly, because this putative social group is neither socially visible nor sufficiently particular, we conclude that the IJ did not err in denying Larios's claim for asylum based on Larios's membership in this particular group.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> <i>Street Children</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Larios next argues that the IJ should have considered evidence that if Larios returned to Guatemala he would have a well-founded fear of persecution based upon his membership within a legally cognizable social group, to wit, \"street children.\" The IJ's alleged failure to address this argument, he contends, deprives him of due process rights. However, not once when testifying did Larios ever specifically claim that he would end up as a street child. Indeed, when asked if he would end up living on the streets, homeless in Guatemala, Larios conceded that he would not. Similarly, there was no argument made before the IJ as to why Larios would even meet the criteria of a \"street child.\" Consequently, because Larios failed to properly raise this claim before the IJ, this argument is deemed waived on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.2008) (finding no error in the BIA's refusal to address claim that had not been properly raised before the IJ).</p>\n<p>In reaching our conclusion we are mindful of the strict standards of review by which we are bound. We do not have the authority to grant the petition unless the evidence compels a conclusion different from that reached by the IJ. <i>Mejilla-Romero v. Holder,</i> 600 F.3d 63, 76 (1st Cir.2010). On the record before us, we cannot say that it does. Substantial evidence exists to uphold the IJ's determination that Larios's testimony, though credible, was not enough to show that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his membership in a statutorily protected social group.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In sum, the IJ's decision to deny Larios's asylum claim was well-reasoned and supported by controlling precedent: substantial evidence exists to uphold the decision of the IJ. The petition is denied.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  § 212(a)(6)(A)(i)of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), states the following:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States:</p>\n<p>(6) Illegal entrants and immigration violators</p>\n<p>(A) Aliens present without admission or parole</p>\n<p>(i) In general</p>\n<p>An alien in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrives in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General, is inadmissible.</p>\n<p>[2]  The IJ also found that Larios was ineligible for voluntary departure because Larios, through counsel, had waived this remedy at the beginning of the hearing.</p>\n<p>[3]  In proceedings before the IJ, Larios never alleged that he had been a victim of past persecution, so we analyze his asylum claim by considering whether he proved a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).</p>\n\n</div>",

He seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) final order, affirming without opinion the Immigration Judge's (IJ) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Limiting his appeal to the asylum issue, Larios argues that the BIA violated his due process rights by summarily affirming a decision in which the IJ allegedly failed to consider all of his claims for relief. For the reasons that follow, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Larios first arrived in the United States on or about July 29, 2005. He was fourteen years old. On September 2, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the immigration court, commencing removal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> proceedings against Larios. DHS maintained that Larios was subject to removal under § 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without admission or parole.<sup>[1]</sup> In his \"Respondent's Pleadings,\" dated August 9, 2006, Larios, through counsel, admitted the truth of the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability. On June 27, 2006, Larios submitted his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. After an evidentiary hearing held on October 1, 2008, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Larios's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims. Finding Larios ineligible for relief because he failed to establish that he faced future persecution on account of a protected ground, the IJ ordered Larios removed to Guatemala.<sup>[2]</sup> On appeal to the BIA, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without issuing a separate opinion. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>In immigration cases, we review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under the highly deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2005). Accordingly, we must affirm the findings upon which the decision is based if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992). This means that the findings must stand unless the record evidence is such as to compel a reasonable fact-finder to make a contrary determination. <i>Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 21; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). We review the agency's legal interpretations de novo, subject to appropriate principles of administrative deference. <i>See </i><i>Naeem v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202513\"><a href=\"/opinion/202513/naeem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2006). We also review de novo whether immigration procedures comport with due process. <i>Walker v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204100\"><a href=\"/opinion/204100/walker-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ's asylum determination, as is the case here, we review the IJ's decision as if it were the decision of the BIA. <i>Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 21; <i>see also </i><i>Albathani v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span>, 373 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Gao v.

The term \"social group\" is not defined by statute.

Moreover, Larios's claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <i>Mendez-Barrera.</i> There, we held that \"young [El Salvadoran] women recruited by gang members who resist such recruitment\" do not constitute a legally cognizable social group because the proposed group lacks social visibility and is not sufficiently particular. <i>Mendez-Barrera,</i> 602 F.3d at 27.
