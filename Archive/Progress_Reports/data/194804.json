Plaintiff,  a former employee  of the\n                    \n\nDepartment  of the  Air Force,  appeals the  district court's\n\ngrant of  summary judgment dismissing  his complaint  brought\n\nunder  the  Privacy  Act.    The  district  court  held  that\n\nplaintiff's   complaint   was   barred  because   it   was  a\n\n\"transparent attempt\" to collaterally attack the result of an\n\nearlier proceeding brought under the Civil Service Reform Act\n\n(\"CSRA\").    Alternatively, the  court held  that plaintiff's\n\nallegations failed  to set forth claims  cognizable under the\n\nPrivacy Act. \n\n          Since  we  agree with  the  district court's  first\n\nground\n\nfor decision,  we have  no  need to  separately consider  the\n\nsufficiency  of  the  claims  under  the  Privacy  Act.    We\n\nsummarize  below  only  the  record facts  necessary  to  our\n\nopinion.\n\n          The dispute  here began with  an investigation  and\n\nreport  by the  Air  Force Office  of Special  Investigations\n\n(\"AFOSI\") regarding certain allegedly improper claims made by\n\nplaintiff for reimbursement of travel expenses.  Based on the\n\ncontents  of  the  AFOSI  report, the  Air  Force  issued  to\n\nplaintiff a  \"Notice of Proposed Removal.\"   Plaintiff sought\n\nhelp from his union.  After a meeting with  plaintiff and his\n\nunion representative, the Air Force Deciding Official instead\n\ndetermined, on  July 19,  1989, to  suspend plaintiff for  14\n\n                             -3-\n\ndays and demote  him one grade.   Plaintiff filed  grievances\n\nfrom the agency's actions,  and then voluntarily resigned his\n\nposition on October 27, 1989.  \n\n          Approximately  four months  after he  resigned, and\n\nseven months  after issuance of  the decision to  suspend and\n\ndemote him, plaintiff filed an appeal from the  decision with\n\nthe   Merit  Systems   Protection   Board   (\"MSPB\").     The\n\nAdministrative Judge (\"AJ\") initially issued an order to show\n\ncause  why the  appeal should  not be  dismissed for  lack of\n\njurisdiction since  ordinarily an employee's choice  to use a\n\nnegotiated  grievance process ousts the MSPB of jurisdiction.\n\n5  U.S.C.      4303,   7121(e),  7512.    However,  plaintiff\n\nprevailed  on the  jurisdictional issue,  producing documents\n\nwhich  showed  that his  grievances  were  filed before,  not\n\nafter,  the  critical  effective  date of  the  demotion  and\n\nsuspension decision.    Nonetheless, the  AJ  concluded  that\n\nplaintiff's  appeal should  be dismissed  because it  had not\n\nbeen filed  within the 20  day regulatory filing  period, and\n\nplaintiff's evidence failed to demonstrate good cause for the\n\ndelay.  Vessella  v. Department  of the Air  Force, MSPB  No.\n                                                  \n\nBNO7529010127, Initial Dec. at  2, 3-5 (June 14, 1990).   The\n\nfull  Board  affirmed  the  dismissal on  October  10,  1990.\n\nVessella  v. Department  of the  Air Force,  1990 MSPB  LEXIS\n                                          \n\n1401.   Plaintiff  was notified  of his  right to  appeal the\n\ndismissal  within  30 days  to  the Federal  Circuit  under 5\n\n                             -4-\n\nU.S.C.   7703(b)(1).     Instead of taking a direct appeal to\n\nthe  Federal Circuit, on March 1, 1991 plaintiff brought this\n\nsuit alleging violations of the  Privacy Act.  The violations\n\nplaintiff alleges here are the same as those he challenged as\n\nimpermissible  adverse personnel  practices before  the MSPB.\n\nWithout attempting to characterize his claims precisely, they\n\ninclude   the   agency's   allegedly  improper   maintenance,\n\ncirculation,  and action upon  inaccurate documents involving\n\nthe  AFOSI  investigation;  the  alleged  withholding   of  a\n\nfavorable  document  for  a  period of  time;  discussion  of\n\nplaintiff's case with other employees without his permission;\n\nand   requests  that   he  disclose   certain   tax  records.\n\nPlaintiff's complaint sought from the district court remedies\n\nnormally   within  the   purview  of   the  MSPB,   including\n\nreinstatement to his former position,  backpay, employment in\n\nanother  office, and correction  of inaccuracies, in addition\n\nto compensation for unspecified injury to his reputation. \n\n          The Privacy  Act  permits  an  individual  to  seek\n\ncorrection of  an agency's  inaccurate or incomplete  records\n\nand  other  relief in  defined circumstances.   It cannot  be\n\nused,  however,  to  frustrate the  exclusive,  comprehensive\n\nscheme provided  by the CSRA for  federal employee challenges\n\nto adverse agency personnel decisions.  See 5 U.S.C.    2301,\n                                           \n\n2302,  7512, 7513; Kleiman v. Department  of Energy, 956 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n335,  338 (D.C.  Cir.  1992), aff'g  742  F. Supp.  697,  699\n                                   \n\n                             -5-\n\n(D.D.C. 1990);  Hubbard v. U.  S. EPA, Adm'r,  809 F.2d  1, 5\n                                            \n\n(D.C.  Cir. 1986),  aff'd in  part on  other grounds  sub nom\n                                                             \n\nSpagnola  v. Mathis, 859 F.2d 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc);\n                   \n\nHenderson v. Social Security Admin., 908 F.2d 559 (10th  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990).  \n\n           While plaintiff  argues here that he  was unfairly\n\ndeprived of a hearing under the CSRA by the dismissal of  his\n\nclaims  as  untimely,  he  was afforded  the  opportunity  to\n\nchallenge  the  dismissal  through  a direct  appeal  to  the\n\nFederal Circuit.  5  U.S.C.    7703(b)(1).  By  restyling his\n\naction  as  a Privacy  Act  claim  instead, he  impermissibly\n\nattempts  to bypass the CSRA's regulatory scheme.  As we have\n\nobserved in related contexts, \"the history and intent of  the\n\nCSRA  plainly  prefigures  that  collateral   district  court\n\njurisdiction  would  impede  the  ideals of  fast,  efficient\n\nmanagement and  greater  uniformity in  the  judicial  review\n\nprocess.\"  Roth v. United States, 952 F.2d 611, 615 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1991) (quoting  Berrios v. Department  of the Army,  884 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n28,  31-32 (1st  Cir. 1989))  (holding that  CSRA's exclusive\n\nremedial scheme  precludes district court suits  by employees\n\nalleging Bivens and state law tort claims).\n               \n\n          Plaintiff  also  challenges   as  error  some   ten\n\nprocedural rulings by the district court, including denial of\n\na request  for appointed  counsel and alleged  misreadings of\n\nthe  record.  Appointment of counsel in civil cases is within\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe broad discretion  of the district  court.  Desrosiers  v.\n                                                         \n\nMoran, 949  F.2d 15, 24  (1st Cir.  1991).  We  see no  abuse\n     \n\nhere.   Having reviewed  the record  de novo,  as we  must on\n                                            \n\nsummary judgment, we find  that the district court thoroughly\n\nand  fairly  characterized the  facts.   We  see no  merit in\n\nplaintiff's remaining contentions.   \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n",
