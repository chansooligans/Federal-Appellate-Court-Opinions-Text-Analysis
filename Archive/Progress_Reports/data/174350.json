Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Thompson, Selya, and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José Luis Novas Debien for appellant.\n     José Capo-Iriarte, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division,\nand Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 30, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n           Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              DYK, Circuit Judge. Wayne Vargas-De Jesús (“Vargas”) was\n\nconvicted      on     two    counts   charging        violations    of     21    U.S.C.   §§\n\n841(a)(1) and 860 — possession with intent to distribute illegal\n\ndrugs within one thousand feet of a school.                   He was also convicted\n\nof one count of conspiracy to violate those provisions.                             See 21\n\nU.S.C.    §    846.         On   appeal,    Vargas     challenges    the        substantive\n\nconvictions         based    on   lack     of    jurisdiction      under    the     Federal\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act (“FJDA”), 18 U.S.C. § 5032, on the ground\n\nthat he was a minor when the offenses were committed.                           Because the\n\ndistrict      court     lacked     jurisdiction        over   the   substantive        drug\n\ncharges, we vacate Vargas’s convictions with respect to those\n\ncounts.       With respect to the conspiracy count, Vargas argues that\n\nthe district court committed plain error by failing to instruct the\n\njury that it could only find him guilty if he ratified and\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy after he turned 18.                         We affirm the\n\nconviction as to the conspiracy count because there was sufficient\n\nevidence of postmajority conduct to convict, and it was not plain\n\nerror for the district court to fail to give the instruction.\n\n                                                I.\n\n              The FJDA provides:\n\n          A juvenile alleged to have committed an act of\n     juvenile delinquency . . . shall not be proceeded against\n     in any court of the United States unless the Attorney\n     General,   after   investigation,    certifies   to   the\n     appropriate district court of the United States that\n     . . . (3) the offense charged is . . . an offense\n     described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act\n     (21 U.S.C. 841) . . . and that there is a substantial\n\n                                                -2-\n\f      Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant\n      the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.\n\n           If the Attorney General does not so certify, such\n      juvenile shall be surrendered to the appropriate legal\n      authorities of such State.\n\n18   U.S.C.   §    5032    (emphasis     added).     The    statute   defines   a\n\n“juvenile”    as   “a     person   who   has   not   attained   his   eighteenth\n\nbirthday, or for the purpose of proceedings and disposition under\n\nthis chapter for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency, a person\n\nwho has not attained his twenty-first birthday,” and “juvenile\n\ndelinquency” as “the violation of a law of the United States\n\ncommitted by a person prior to his eighteenth birthday which would\n\nhave been a crime if committed by an adult.”               Id. § 5031.   In other\n\nwords, the statute provides that unless the Attorney General\n\ncertifies to the district court that the case satisfies one of\n\ncertain enumerated conditions, the district court may not proceed\n\nagainst an individual under the age of 21 for acts committed before\n\nreaching the age of 18.1       See United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202,\n\n1207 (1st Cir. 1993) (“[T]he FJDA does not apply to ‘a defendant\n\nwho . . . is not a juvenile and who has not committed an act of\n\n\n      1\n          The FJDA does not, however, make the defendant’s age a\nsubstantive element of an offense. United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d\n1202, 1207 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States v.\nFrasquillo-Zomosa, 626 F.2d 99, 101 (9th Cir. 1980)). While the\ncertification by the Attorney General is necessary for a district\ncourt to proceed against a juvenile in a delinquency proceeding,\nstill more is required for the court to try a juvenile as an adult.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 5032 (permitting adult trials of juveniles only\nafter a judicial hearing and determination that “transfer” for\ntrial as an adult would serve the interests of justice).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fjuvenile delinquency.’” (quoting United States v. Doerr, 886 F.2d\n\n944, 969 (7th Cir. 1989)); see also United States v. Thomas, 114\n\nF.3d 228, 263 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“[A] person who has reached\n\ntwenty-one can be criminally indicted for the acts committed under\n\neighteen because it is assumed he can no longer benefit from FJDA\n\nprotections.”). It is undisputed that in this case, the government\n\ndid not present the district court with such a certification, and\n\nthat the proceedings commenced before the defendant reached the age\n\nof 21.\n\n          The   issues    in   this   case   arise    out   of   alleged      acts\n\ncommitted both before and after the defendant reached the age of\n\n18.   It is undisputed that Vargas was born on July 22, 1989, and\n\nreached 18 years of age on July 22, 2007.           On May 7, 2008, a grand\n\njury returned a seven count indictment charging Vargas and numerous\n\ncodefendants with various narcotics offenses.           Six of those counts\n\nare pertinent here.       Count 1 charged Vargas with conspiracy to\n\npossess with the intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of\n\nheroin, fifty grams of cocaine base, five kilograms of cocaine,\n\nand/or one hundred kilograms of marijuana within one thousand feet\n\nof a public or private school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846, and 860.          We refer to this count as the drug\n\nconspiracy   count.      Counts   2   through   5    charged     him   with    the\n\nsubstantive offenses of aiding and abetting in the possession of\n\nheroin, cocaine base, cocaine, and marijuana, respectively, within\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fone thousand feet of a school with intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 860, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.                       We\n\nrefer to these as the substantive drug counts.                     Count 6 charged\n\nVargas with conspiracy to possess firearms during and in relation\n\nto   a       drug    trafficking    offense     in    violation   of    18   U.S.C.    §\n\n924(c)(1)(A).          We refer to this as the firearms conspiracy count.\n\nAccording to the indictment, each of the charges against Vargas\n\narose out of alleged activities “[b]eginning on a date unknown, but\n\nno later than in or about the year 2005, and continuing up to and\n\nuntil the return of the instant Indictment [May 7, 2008].”\n\n                   At trial, the government presented testimony regarding\n\nthe defendant’s activities from local police officers, cooperating\n\ndrug traffickers, and a paid confidential informant.                     Much of this\n\ntestimony related to conduct prior to Vargas’s eighteenth birthday.\n\nThe defendant did not request, and the district court did not\n\nissue,        an    instruction    to   the    jury   regarding   the    findings     of\n\npostmajority conduct necessary to convict Vargas.                      The jury found\n\nVargas guilty of substantive drug counts 2 and 4, and the drug\n\nconspiracy count.2          The jury acquitted on substantive drug counts\n\n\n         2\n          The jury verdict form erroneously described count 2 as\ninvolving cocaine base when it should have been heroin, and count\n3 as heroin instead of cocaine base.     See Verdict Form at 2-3,\nUnited States v. Vargas, No. 08-175 (D.P.R. Nov. 26, 2008), ECF No.\n443. Thus, although the jury found Vargas guilty of count 2, it\nappears that the jury likely thought it was finding Vargas guilty\nof the cocaine base substantive offense (count 3 of the\nindictment), not the heroin offense (count 2 of the indictment).\nThe presentence investigation report followed the jury verdict\n\n                                              -5-\n\fthree and five, and the firearms conspiracy count.                   Although the\n\ntrial testimony made no reference to the defendant’s age, his date\n\nof birth and age were noted in the presentence report.                       The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Vargas to 210 months’ imprisonment as to\n\neach count for which he was convicted, to be served concurrently,\n\nand ten years of supervised release.           Vargas timely appealed, and\n\nwe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             On appeal, Vargas argues that the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction over the substantive drug counts as to which he was\n\nconvicted.     See 18 U.S.C. § 5032.          We review the jurisdictional\n\nissue de novo.       Miller v. Nichols, 586 F.3d 53, 58-59 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).       Although Vargas failed to raise this issue with the\n\ndistrict court, “[an] objection to subject matter jurisdiction is\n\nnot waivable and may be raised for the first time on appeal.”\n\nF.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R., 449 F.3d\n\n185,   189    (1st   Cir.   2006);   see    Fed.   R.   Crim.   P.    12(b)(3)(B)\n\n(providing that lack of jurisdiction may be noticed by court at any\n\ntime); United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1244 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n\n\n\nform, listing the conviction under count 2 as a conviction for\ncocaine base. In light of our disposition, there is no need for us\nto determine whether this error is an independent ground for\nreversal.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            Vargas argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction\n\nbecause the government failed to provide the required certification\n\neven though he was less than 18 years old when he committed the\n\nsubstantive drug offenses, and still under 21 when indicted.                 The\n\ngovernment concedes that the age of a defendant is jurisdictional\n\nunder the statute.      (“If the defendant had committed the offense\n\nprior to his birthday and he did not continue committing the\n\noffense beyond his eighteenth birthday, that conviction would have\n\nto be reversed.     That is the position of the United States.”).\n\n            On its face, the language of the statute — providing that\n\na juvenile “shall not be proceeded against in any court of the\n\nUnited States” — appears jurisdictional.            18 U.S.C. § 5032.        Such\n\nmandatory language is generally held to be jurisdictional.                   See\n\nLexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26,\n\n35 (1998) (“[T]he mandatory ‘shall’ . . . normally creates an\n\nobligation impervious to judicial discretion.”); California v.\n\nGrace   Brethren   Church,     457   U.S.   393,    407-08    (1982)   (statute\n\nproviding that district courts “shall not enjoin, suspend or\n\nrestrain the . . . collection of any tax under State law” “divests\n\nthe district court . . . of jurisdiction”); Mohasco Corp. v.\n\nSilver,    447   U.S.   807,   817   (1980)    (holding      that   action    was\n\njurisdictionally    barred     for   failure   to    comply    with    statutory\n\nprovision that “such charge shall be filed” within specified time\n\nlimits).\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          Other courts of appeals have uniformly held that the\n\ncertification requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 5032 is a prerequisite to\n\na district court’s subject matter jurisdiction.             See United States\n\nv. Sealed Juvenile 1, 225 F.3d 507, 508 (5th Cir. 2000) (“The need\n\ncertification   under     18     U.S.C.    §   5032   is    a    jurisdictional\n\nrequirement . . . .”); In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d 208, 211 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997) (“certification must be a jurisdictional requirement”\n\nthat “go[es] to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court”);\n\nUnited States v. Wong, 40 F.3d 1347, 1363 (2d Cir. 1994) (“[P]roper\n\ncertification   confers        jurisdiction    upon   the       district   court\n\n. . . .”); United States v. Chambers, 944 F.2d 1253, 1259 (6th Cir.\n\n1991) (“[T]he certification requirement is a prerequisite to the\n\ndistrict court’s subject-matter jurisdiction in cases where the\n\ngovernment proceeds against juveniles accused of performing acts\n\nwhich would be federal crimes if committed by adults.”); United\n\nStates v. Juvenile Male, 864 F.2d 641, 643 (9th Cir. 1988) (“To\n\nestablish jurisdiction for such an adjudication, the juvenile\n\ndelinquency procedures require the government to file a special\n\ncertification regarding the juvenile before it can proceed against\n\nthat juvenile . . . .”).\n\n          Although not directly deciding the question, this court\n\nhas recognized as well that the certification requirement of § 5032\n\nis jurisdictional.   See United States v. Female Juvenile, A.F.S.,\n\n377 F.3d 27, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that § 5032 provides\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f“that a district court has jurisdiction over a juvenile” if the\n\ncertification requirement is met); United States v. Smith, 178 F.3d\n\n22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that “§ 5032 provides that a\n\ndistrict   court    has    jurisdiction    over   a     juvenile   if”    the\n\ncertification requirement is satisfied, and that “[o]nce federal\n\njurisdiction has attached, juvenile delinquency proceedings ensue\n\nunless the court transfers the juvenile for prosecution as an\n\nadult”).     We    agree   that   the    certification     requirement     is\n\njurisdictional, and that absent a certification, a conviction must\n\nbe set aside, even absent a timely objection, if the record\n\nestablishes that a defendant was under the age of 18 when the\n\noffense was committed and under the age of 21 when criminal\n\nproceedings were commenced.\n\n           The remaining question is whether the evidence here on\n\nthe two substantive drug counts was limited to acts occurring\n\nbefore the defendant reached the age of 18.           Vargas argues that it\n\nwas.   The government failed to defend the convictions on these two\n\ncounts in its brief, but at oral argument urged for the first time\n\nthat there was sufficient postmajority evidence to convict.              While\n\nwe would be justified in treating the failure to brief the issue as\n\na waiver, we choose to address the issue on the merits.\n\n           The government admits that Vargas was born on July 22,\n\n1989, and that he reached majority on July 22, 2007.               It also\n\nacknowledges that much of the evidence presented against Vargas at\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftrial on the substantive drug counts involved activities that\n\noccurred when he was under the age of 18.             At oral argument, the\n\ngovernment accurately asserted that the indictment did not provide\n\na specific date for the substantive drug offense counts; instead,\n\nas with the conspiracy count, the indictment stated that the\n\nalleged crimes “[b]eg[an] on a date unknown, but no later than in\n\nor about the year 2005, and continu[ed] up to and until the return\n\nof   the   instant    Indictment,”     i.e.,   past   the   date    of   Vargas’s\n\nmajority.    But while the indictment may have charged postmajority\n\nconduct, the record is clear that the only evidence to support\n\nVargas’s convictions on the substantive drug offenses related to\n\nthe period before he reached age 18.\n\n            The      only   evidence    that    potentially        supports   the\n\nsubstantive drug offense convictions is the testimony of paid\n\nconfidential      informant    Ulises    Martínez     Camacho      (“Martínez”).\n\nMartínez’s role as an informant was to insert himself within a\n\nlocal drug organization and purchase narcotics. Martínez first met\n\nVargas around April 4, 2007. Martínez described occasions in which\n\nhe purchased illegal drugs from Vargas.           First, on April 19, 2007,\n\nMartínez called Vargas to purchase two packages of crack cocaine\n\nfor $500.    Martínez made the buy, but Vargas was not present at the\n\nactual exchange. On May 11, 2007, Martínez arranged with Vargas to\n\nbuy an eighth of a kilogram of crack for $2,200 or $2,500.                Again,\n\nVargas was not present at the exchange, and in this instance\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fMartínez was swindled with a sweet confection made of sugar and\n\ncoconut known as dulce de coco, rather than drugs.                 During the same\n\nconversation, however, Vargas and Martínez also discussed the sale\n\nof ten kilograms of cocaine for $15,000 per kilogram.\n\n           Martínez thus testified to deals involving only crack\n\n(cocaine base) and cocaine — the same drugs for which Vargas was\n\nfound guilty on the substantive charges.               However, that testimony\n\nrelated to events which occurred before Vargas reached the age of\n\n18.    Because   the   government      failed     to     provide    the   necessary\n\ncertification    under       the    FJDA,     Vargas’s     convictions     on   the\n\nsubstantive drug offenses must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Male Juvenile, 148 F.3d 468, 472 (5th\n\nCir. 1998) (vacating adjudication of juvenile delinquency for lack\n\nof    jurisdiction     due     to    failure     to      provide     proper     FJDA\n\ncertification); United States v. Doe, 98 F.3d 459, 461 (9th Cir.\n\n1996) (same).\n\n                                       III.\n\n           As to the conspiracy charge, we hold that the district\n\ncourt had jurisdiction.        Here, the indictment charged Vargas with\n\nthe drug conspiracy “[b]eginning on a date unknown, but no later\n\nthan in or about the year 2005, and continuing up to and until the\n\nreturn of the instant Indictment” — namely, May 7, 2008.                   Although\n\nVargas was under 18 at the beginning of this charged period, he had\n\nreached the age of majority by the end of the period.                     In United\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fStates v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1207 (1st Cir. 1993), we held that\n\nsuch an indictment was not defective simply because the period\n\nincludes premajority conduct.\n\n          This court has also held that the jury may properly hear\n\nevidence regarding a defendant’s premajority conduct to establish\n\nthe existence of a conspiracy.        In Welch, this court considered\n\nwhether evidence of premajority conduct should be withheld from the\n\njury, and rejected that argument:\n\n          We think the better view is that . . . “once [the\n     government] ha[s] established that certain acts of the\n     offense occurred after the defendant’s eighteenth\n     birthday, the entire case may be tried in accordance with\n     the adult rules of procedure and evidence.” . . . We\n     therefore hold that a criminal defendant’s pre-majority\n     conduct is admissible on the same bases as other\n     evidence, and does not alone compel severance of a\n     youthful defendant’s trial.\n\nId. at 1212 (quoting United States v. Cruz, 805 F.2d 1464, 1477\n\n(11th Cir. 1986)).       However, where a case involves conduct both\n\nbefore and after the age of 18, there can be “no conviction unless\n\nthe jury found that appellant[] in some manner ‘ratified’ [his]\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy after attaining majority.”          Id.\n\n          There    was    ample   evidence   here   that   the   defendant\n\ncontinued his participation in the conspiracy after he reached the\n\nage of majority.         Three officers from the Puerto Rico Police\n\nDepartment testified that they continued to observe Vargas at the\n\nlocal drug point after he had turned 18.            In addition, Ricardo\n\nMadera Báez (“Madera”), a member of a rival drug gang, testified\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthat Vargas attended a meeting between rival drug gangs in November\n\n2007, four months after Vargas’s eighteenth birthday, where Vargas\n\ndeclared   that    he    was   the   “owner”     of   cocaine   for   his   group.\n\nTherefore,    it   was    proper     for   the   jury    to   consider   Vargas’s\n\npremajority conduct as well in finding him guilty of the drug\n\nconspiracy.\n\n           The defendant does not contend here that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to convict on the drug conspiracy count under the\n\ngoverning standard, with one exception.               The defendant argues that\n\nwe must assume that the jury did not credit the testimony of Madera\n\nbecause the jury acquitted Vargas on count 6 of the indictment.\n\nThat count charged a conspiracy to possess firearms during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense.                    At trial, the only\n\nevidence of Vargas’s postmajority conduct relating to firearms was\n\nthe testimony by Madera that Vargas showed off his .45-caliber\n\nhandgun at the November 2007 meeting.                   Vargas argues that his\n\nacquittal on the firearms conspiracy charge means that the jury\n\n“discredited” Madera’s testimony.                He therefore contends that\n\nMadera’s testimony thus cannot support a conviction on the drug\n\nconspiracy charge, and without that testimony there is insufficient\n\nevidence to convict.\n\n           Even if we were to assume that Madera’s testimony was\n\nessential to the conviction on the drug conspiracy count and that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthe verdicts were inconsistent,3 defendant’s argument is meritless.\n\nIn United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57 (1984), the Supreme Court\n\nheld that an acquittal on one charge in a criminal case does not\n\ncreate collateral estoppel as to other charges.             That decision\n\nreaffirmed the rule established in Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S.\n\n390 (1932), that “a criminal defendant convicted by a jury on one\n\ncount [can] not attack that conviction because it was inconsistent\n\nwith the jury’s verdict of acquittal on another count.”           Powell,\n\n469 U.S. at 58.      In Powell, a jury acquitted the defendant of drug\n\nconspiracy and possession counts, but found the defendant guilty of\n\ncompound offenses involving the use of a telephone in “committing\n\nand   in   causing   and   facilitating”   the   alleged   conspiracy   and\n\npossession.      Id. at 59-60.     The court of appeals reversed the\n\nconvictions, holding that a defendant cannot be found guilty of\n\nfacilitating a felony for which he has been acquitted.             Id. at\n\n60-62.     The Supreme Court reversed.     Because inconsistent verdicts\n\nmay be the result of juror mistake or lenity, and because the\n\ngovernment cannot appeal an acquittal, the Court held that “the\n\n\n\n      3\n          The verdicts were not in fact necessarily inconsistent.\nCount 6 charged that Vargas and his codefendants “did knowingly and\nintentionally, combine, conspire, and agree with each other and\nwith diverse other persons . . . to knowingly and intentionally\npossess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime.” While there was evidence presented to the jury that Vargas\npossessed firearms both before and after his eighteenth birthday,\nthe jury could have concluded that there was no evidence that\nVargas “combine[d], conspire[d], and agree[d]” with others to\npossess firearms.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fbest course to take is simply to insulate jury verdicts from review\n\non this ground.”      See id. at 69.       Under these circumstances, the\n\npotential inconsistency in the verdicts is not a ground for setting\n\naside the drug conspiracy conviction.\n\n           The defendant also contends that the district court\n\nshould have charged the jury as to the appropriate standard to be\n\nused when the conspiracy occurred in part before and in part after\n\nthe age of majority.         See Welch, 15 F.3d at 1211-12; see also\n\nUnited States v. Maddox, 944 F.2d 1223, 1233 (6th Cir. 1991).            In\n\nother words, he contends that the jury should have been charged\n\nthat it could only find Vargas guilty if it found that he ratified\n\nhis participation in the conspiracy after turning 18.           There was,\n\nhowever, no contemporaneous objection to the failure to give such\n\na charge, so the plain error standard applies.           United States v.\n\nRiccio, 529 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 2008).           Under this standard, a\n\nconviction may only be disturbed if the appellant meets the “heavy\n\nburden of showing (1) that an error occurred; (2) that the error\n\nwas clear or obvious; (3) that the error affected his substantial\n\nrights;   and   (4)   that   the   error   also   seriously   impaired   the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\n\nId.   “Even then, the reviewing court may, but is not required to,\n\nrectify the situation.”       United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n735-36 (1993)).       As such, “plain error review tends to afford\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\frelief    to    appellants    only   for     ‘blockbuster[]’      errors.”        Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.\n\n1987)).    Even if we were to assume that the error was plain —\n\ndespite the fact that Vargas did not rely on the age issue at\n\ntrial, see United States v. George, 448 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) — the plain error standard has not been satisfied.                 Under the\n\nthird    prong    of   the   plain   error    test,   Vargas      is   required    to\n\ndemonstrate that the error was prejudicial.                    United States v.\n\nGarcia-Pastrana,       584   F.3d    351,     382   (1st   Cir.    2009).     That\n\nrequirement has not been met.\n\n               In order to show that an error was prejudicial, an\n\nappellant “must show that the error likely ‘affected the outcome of\n\nthe district court proceedings.’”              United States v. Hebshie, 549\n\nF.3d 30, 44 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734).                 This\n\nmeans that he must show “a reasonable probability that, but for\n\n[the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”      United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 221 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (en banc) (quoting United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\n\nU.S. 74, 82 (2004)) (quotation marks omitted).              “[I]t is enough to\n\nsustain the conviction that the result would quite likely have been\n\nthe same” even if a proper instruction had been given.                            See\n\nHebshie, 549 F.3d at 44 (quoting United States v. O’Brien, 435 F.3d\n\n36, 40 (1st Cir. 2006)) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            Here, as noted above, although most of the conspiracy\n\nevidence related to Vargas’s conduct as a minor, there was evidence\n\npresented at trial that supported his ratification and continued\n\nparticipation in the drug conspiracy after attaining the age of\n\nmajority.     Officers   from   the    Puerto   Rico      Police     Department\n\ntestified that they continued to observe Vargas at the local drug\n\npoint after he had turned 18.         And Madera testified that Vargas\n\nattended a meeting between rival drug gangs in November 2007, after\n\nVargas turned 18, where Vargas declared that he was the “owner” of\n\ncocaine for his group.    In light of this evidence of postmajority\n\nconduct, we hold that the district court did not commit plain error\n\nin not providing a jury instruction on postmajority ratification.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Vargas’s substantive\n\ndrug   offense   convictions    on    counts    2   and    4   for    lack   of\n\njurisdiction.    We affirm the conviction as to the drug conspiracy.\n\nThe case is remanded to the district court with instructions to\n\ndismiss counts 2 and 4.\n\n\n\n         AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

Wayne Vargas-De Jesús (“Vargas”) was\n\nconvicted      on     two    counts   charging        violations    of     21    U.S.C.   §§\n\n841(a)(1) and 860 — possession with intent to distribute illegal\n\ndrugs within one thousand feet of a school.                   He was also convicted\n\nof one count of conspiracy to violate those provisions.                             See 21\n\nU.S.C.    §    846.         On   appeal,    Vargas     challenges    the        substantive\n\nconvictions         based    on   lack     of    jurisdiction      under    the     Federal\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act (“FJDA”), 18 U.S.C. § 5032, on the ground\n\nthat he was a minor when the offenses were committed.                           Because the\n\ndistrict      court     lacked     jurisdiction        over   the   substantive        drug\n\ncharges, we vacate Vargas’s convictions with respect to those\n\ncounts.       With respect to the conspiracy count, Vargas argues that\n\nthe district court committed plain error by failing to instruct the\n\njury that it could only find him guilty if he ratified and\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy after he turned 18.                         We affirm the\n\nconviction as to the conspiracy count because there was sufficient\n\nevidence of postmajority conduct to convict, and it was not plain\n\nerror for the district court to fail to give the instruction.\n\n                                                I.\n\n              The FJDA provides:\n\n          A juvenile alleged to have committed an act of\n     juvenile delinquency . . . shall not be proceeded against\n     in any court of the United States unless the Attorney\n     General,   after   investigation,    certifies   to   the\n     appropriate district court of the United States that\n     . . . (3) the offense charged is . . . an offense\n     described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act\n     (21 U.S.C. 841) . . . and that there is a substantial\n\n                                                -2-\n\f      Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant\n      the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.\n\n           If the Attorney General does not so certify, such\n      juvenile shall be surrendered to the appropriate legal\n      authorities of such State.\n\n18   U.S.C.   §    5032    (emphasis     added).     The    statute   defines   a\n\n“juvenile”    as   “a     person   who   has   not   attained   his   eighteenth\n\nbirthday, or for the purpose of proceedings and disposition under\n\nthis chapter for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency, a person\n\nwho has not attained his twenty-first birthday,” and “juvenile\n\ndelinquency” as “the violation of a law of the United States\n\ncommitted by a person prior to his eighteenth birthday which would\n\nhave been a crime if committed by an adult.”               Id. § 5031.   In other\n\nwords, the statute provides that unless the Attorney General\n\ncertifies to the district court that the case satisfies one of\n\ncertain enumerated conditions, the district court may not proceed\n\nagainst an individual under the age of 21 for acts committed before\n\nreaching the age of 18.1       See United States v.

It is undisputed that in this case, the government\n\ndid not present the district court with such a certification, and\n\nthat the proceedings commenced before the defendant reached the age\n\nof 21.\n\n          The   issues    in   this   case   arise    out   of   alleged      acts\n\ncommitted both before and after the defendant reached the age of\n\n18.   It is undisputed that Vargas was born on July 22, 1989, and\n\nreached 18 years of age on July 22, 2007.           On May 7, 2008, a grand\n\njury returned a seven count indictment charging Vargas and numerous\n\ncodefendants with various narcotics offenses.           Six of those counts\n\nare pertinent here.       Count 1 charged Vargas with conspiracy to\n\npossess with the intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of\n\nheroin, fifty grams of cocaine base, five kilograms of cocaine,\n\nand/or one hundred kilograms of marijuana within one thousand feet\n\nof a public or private school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846, and 860.          We refer to this count as the drug\n\nconspiracy   count.      Counts   2   through   5    charged     him   with    the\n\nsubstantive offenses of aiding and abetting in the possession of\n\nheroin, cocaine base, cocaine, and marijuana, respectively, within\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fone thousand feet of a school with intent to distribute, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 860, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.                       We\n\nrefer to these as the substantive drug counts.                     Count 6 charged\n\nVargas with conspiracy to possess firearms during and in relation\n\nto   a       drug    trafficking    offense     in    violation   of    18   U.S.C.    §\n\n924(c)(1)(A).          We refer to this as the firearms conspiracy count.\n\nAccording to the indictment, each of the charges against Vargas\n\narose out of alleged activities “[b]eginning on a date unknown, but\n\nno later than in or about the year 2005, and continuing up to and\n\nuntil the return of the instant Indictment [May 7, 2008].”\n\n                   At trial, the government presented testimony regarding\n\nthe defendant’s activities from local police officers, cooperating\n\ndrug traffickers, and a paid confidential informant.                     Much of this\n\ntestimony related to conduct prior to Vargas’s eighteenth birthday.\n\nThe defendant did not request, and the district court did not\n\nissue,        an    instruction    to   the    jury   regarding   the    findings     of\n\npostmajority conduct necessary to convict Vargas.                      The jury found\n\nVargas guilty of substantive drug counts 2 and 4, and the drug\n\nconspiracy count.2          The jury acquitted on substantive drug counts\n\n\n         2\n          The jury verdict form erroneously described count 2 as\ninvolving cocaine base when it should have been heroin, and count\n3 as heroin instead of cocaine base.     See Verdict Form at 2-3,\nUnited States v. Vargas, No. 08-175 (D.P.R. Nov. 26, 2008), ECF No.\n443. Thus, although the jury found Vargas guilty of count 2, it\nappears that the jury likely thought it was finding Vargas guilty\nof the cocaine base substantive offense (count 3 of the\nindictment), not the heroin offense (count 2 of the indictment).\nThe presentence investigation report followed the jury verdict\n\n                                              -5-\n\fthree and five, and the firearms conspiracy count.                   Although the\n\ntrial testimony made no reference to the defendant’s age, his date\n\nof birth and age were noted in the presentence report.                       The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Vargas to 210 months’ imprisonment as to\n\neach count for which he was convicted, to be served concurrently,\n\nand ten years of supervised release.           Vargas timely appealed, and\n\nwe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             On appeal, Vargas argues that the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction over the substantive drug counts as to which he was\n\nconvicted.     See 18 U.S.C. § 5032.          We review the jurisdictional\n\nissue de novo.       Miller v.

We    agree   that   the    certification     requirement     is\n\njurisdictional, and that absent a certification, a conviction must\n\nbe set aside, even absent a timely objection, if the record\n\nestablishes that a defendant was under the age of 18 when the\n\noffense was committed and under the age of 21 when criminal\n\nproceedings were commenced.\n\n           The remaining question is whether the evidence here on\n\nthe two substantive drug counts was limited to acts occurring\n\nbefore the defendant reached the age of 18.           Vargas argues that it\n\nwas.   The government failed to defend the convictions on these two\n\ncounts in its brief, but at oral argument urged for the first time\n\nthat there was sufficient postmajority evidence to convict.              While\n\nwe would be justified in treating the failure to brief the issue as\n\na waiver, we choose to address the issue on the merits.\n\n           The government admits that Vargas was born on July 22,\n\n1989, and that he reached majority on July 22, 2007.               It also\n\nacknowledges that much of the evidence presented against Vargas at\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftrial on the substantive drug counts involved activities that\n\noccurred when he was under the age of 18.             At oral argument, the\n\ngovernment accurately asserted that the indictment did not provide\n\na specific date for the substantive drug offense counts; instead,\n\nas with the conspiracy count, the indictment stated that the\n\nalleged crimes “[b]eg[an] on a date unknown, but no later than in\n\nor about the year 2005, and continu[ed] up to and until the return\n\nof   the   instant    Indictment,”     i.e.,   past   the   date    of   Vargas’s\n\nmajority.    But while the indictment may have charged postmajority\n\nconduct, the record is clear that the only evidence to support\n\nVargas’s convictions on the substantive drug offenses related to\n\nthe period before he reached age 18.\n\n            The      only   evidence    that    potentially        supports   the\n\nsubstantive drug offense convictions is the testimony of paid\n\nconfidential      informant    Ulises    Martínez     Camacho      (“Martínez”).\n\nMartínez’s role as an informant was to insert himself within a\n\nlocal drug organization and purchase narcotics. Martínez first met\n\nVargas around April 4, 2007. Martínez described occasions in which\n\nhe purchased illegal drugs from Vargas.           First, on April 19, 2007,\n\nMartínez called Vargas to purchase two packages of crack cocaine\n\nfor $500.    Martínez made the buy, but Vargas was not present at the\n\nactual exchange. On May 11, 2007, Martínez arranged with Vargas to\n\nbuy an eighth of a kilogram of crack for $2,200 or $2,500.                Again,\n\nVargas was not present at the exchange, and in this instance\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fMartínez was swindled with a sweet confection made of sugar and\n\ncoconut known as dulce de coco, rather than drugs.                 During the same\n\nconversation, however, Vargas and Martínez also discussed the sale\n\nof ten kilograms of cocaine for $15,000 per kilogram.\n\n           Martínez thus testified to deals involving only crack\n\n(cocaine base) and cocaine — the same drugs for which Vargas was\n\nfound guilty on the substantive charges.               However, that testimony\n\nrelated to events which occurred before Vargas reached the age of\n\n18.    Because   the   government      failed     to     provide    the   necessary\n\ncertification    under       the    FJDA,     Vargas’s     convictions     on   the\n\nsubstantive drug offenses must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

In Welch, this court considered\n\nwhether evidence of premajority conduct should be withheld from the\n\njury, and rejected that argument:\n\n          We think the better view is that . . . “once [the\n     government] ha[s] established that certain acts of the\n     offense occurred after the defendant’s eighteenth\n     birthday, the entire case may be tried in accordance with\n     the adult rules of procedure and evidence.” . . . We\n     therefore hold that a criminal defendant’s pre-majority\n     conduct is admissible on the same bases as other\n     evidence, and does not alone compel severance of a\n     youthful defendant’s trial.\n\nId. at 1212 (quoting United States v.

However, where a case involves conduct both\n\nbefore and after the age of 18, there can be “no conviction unless\n\nthe jury found that appellant[] in some manner ‘ratified’ [his]\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy after attaining majority.”          Id.\n\n          There    was    ample   evidence   here   that   the   defendant\n\ncontinued his participation in the conspiracy after he reached the\n\nage of majority.         Three officers from the Puerto Rico Police\n\nDepartment testified that they continued to observe Vargas at the\n\nlocal drug point after he had turned 18.            In addition, Ricardo\n\nMadera Báez (“Madera”), a member of a rival drug gang, testified\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthat Vargas attended a meeting between rival drug gangs in November\n\n2007, four months after Vargas’s eighteenth birthday, where Vargas\n\ndeclared   that    he    was   the   “owner”     of   cocaine   for   his   group.\n\nTherefore,    it   was    proper     for   the   jury    to   consider   Vargas’s\n\npremajority conduct as well in finding him guilty of the drug\n\nconspiracy.\n\n           The defendant does not contend here that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to convict on the drug conspiracy count under the\n\ngoverning standard, with one exception.               The defendant argues that\n\nwe must assume that the jury did not credit the testimony of Madera\n\nbecause the jury acquitted Vargas on count 6 of the indictment.\n\nThat count charged a conspiracy to possess firearms during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense.                    At trial, the only\n\nevidence of Vargas’s postmajority conduct relating to firearms was\n\nthe testimony by Madera that Vargas showed off his .45-caliber\n\nhandgun at the November 2007 meeting.                   Vargas argues that his\n\nacquittal on the firearms conspiracy charge means that the jury\n\n“discredited” Madera’s testimony.                He therefore contends that\n\nMadera’s testimony thus cannot support a conviction on the drug\n\nconspiracy charge, and without that testimony there is insufficient\n\nevidence to convict.\n\n           Even if we were to assume that Madera’s testimony was\n\nessential to the conviction on the drug conspiracy count and that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthe verdicts were inconsistent,3 defendant’s argument is meritless.\n\nIn United States v.

In Powell, a jury acquitted the defendant of drug\n\nconspiracy and possession counts, but found the defendant guilty of\n\ncompound offenses involving the use of a telephone in “committing\n\nand   in   causing   and   facilitating”   the   alleged   conspiracy   and\n\npossession.      Id. at 59-60.     The court of appeals reversed the\n\nconvictions, holding that a defendant cannot be found guilty of\n\nfacilitating a felony for which he has been acquitted.             Id. at\n\n60-62.     The Supreme Court reversed.     Because inconsistent verdicts\n\nmay be the result of juror mistake or lenity, and because the\n\ngovernment cannot appeal an acquittal, the Court held that “the\n\n\n\n      3\n          The verdicts were not in fact necessarily inconsistent.\nCount 6 charged that Vargas and his codefendants “did knowingly and\nintentionally, combine, conspire, and agree with each other and\nwith diverse other persons . . . to knowingly and intentionally\npossess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime.” While there was evidence presented to the jury that Vargas\npossessed firearms both before and after his eighteenth birthday,\nthe jury could have concluded that there was no evidence that\nVargas “combine[d], conspire[d], and agree[d]” with others to\npossess firearms.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fbest course to take is simply to insulate jury verdicts from review\n\non this ground.”      See id. at 69.       Under these circumstances, the\n\npotential inconsistency in the verdicts is not a ground for setting\n\naside the drug conspiracy conviction.\n\n           The defendant also contends that the district court\n\nshould have charged the jury as to the appropriate standard to be\n\nused when the conspiracy occurred in part before and in part after\n\nthe age of majority.

In\n\nother words, he contends that the jury should have been charged\n\nthat it could only find Vargas guilty if it found that he ratified\n\nhis participation in the conspiracy after turning 18.

That\n\nrequirement has not been met.\n\n               In order to show that an error was prejudicial, an\n\nappellant “must show that the error likely ‘affected the outcome of\n\nthe district court proceedings.’”              United States v.

Officers   from   the    Puerto   Rico      Police     Department\n\ntestified that they continued to observe Vargas at the local drug\n\npoint after he had turned 18.         And Madera testified that Vargas\n\nattended a meeting between rival drug gangs in November 2007, after\n\nVargas turned 18, where Vargas declared that he was the “owner” of\n\ncocaine for his group.    In light of this evidence of postmajority\n\nconduct, we hold that the district court did not commit plain error\n\nin not providing a jury instruction on postmajority ratification.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Vargas’s substantive\n\ndrug   offense   convictions    on    counts    2   and    4   for    lack   of\n\njurisdiction.    We affirm the conviction as to the drug conspiracy.\n\nThe case is remanded to the district court with instructions to\n\ndismiss counts 2 and 4.\n\n\n\n         AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f</pre>",
