This appeal presents questions\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \n\nconcerning the  legality of an investigatory  stop, a warrantless\n\nautomobile  search, and  an ensuing  interrogation.   Contrary to\n\nappellant's importuning, we hold that the Supreme Court's opinion\n\nin  California v.  Hodari  D.,  499  U.S.  621  (1991),  did  not\r                                       \n\nreconfigure the doctrine  of Terry  v. Ohio, 392  U.S. 1  (1968),\r                                                     \n\nand,   therefore,  did   not  transmogrify   the   law  governing\n\ninvestigatory stops.  Thus, we conclude on the facts of this case\n\nthat a  slight physical  touching by  a police  officer, effected\n\nunder circumstances  falling short of probable cause,  did not in\n\nitself  transform a lawful Terry  stop into an  unlawful de facto\r                                                                           \n\narrest.   Discerning  no  clear  error in  the  district  court's\n\nremaining findings    that defendant consented  to the challenged\n\nsearch  (a  search  that  yielded  evidence  which in  any  event\n\ninevitably  would  have been  discovered)  and  that neither  the\n\nseized  evidence  nor  the statements  to  the  police should  be\n\nsuppressed   we affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r          I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          We offer a decurtate summary of the events pertinent to\n\nthis  appeal, recounting  them in  a manner  consistent with  the\n\ndistrict court's supportable findings of fact.\n\n          Upon  being  alerted  by  a  reliable  informant  about\n\nnarcotics-related  activity  at  a certain  dwelling  in  Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts, the federal  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\n\nmounted  a  surveillance.   On February  4, 1992,  federal agents\n\nobserved defendant-appellant Walter DeJesus Zapata drive from the\n\n                                2\r\n\nsite  of  the surveillance  to another  address.1   He  entered a\n\nhouse at that address and helped to load two duffel bags into the\n\ntrunk of a second car.  Appellant departed  in the laden vehicle.\n\nHe drove  in an unorthodox manner,  bobbing, weaving, continually\n\nchanging  lanes, and  alternating  driving speeds.   Finally,  he\n\nswerved  sharply from  a high-speed  throughway into  an adjacent\n\nrest area, without signalling.   The trailing DEA  agent followed\n\nand radioed for help.  By this time, the authorities had verified\n\nthat   the  car   driven  by   appellant  was   unregistered  and\n\nuninsured.2\n\n          Appellant left  his  vehicle and  entered  a  fast-food\n\nrestaurant.   Four law enforcement officers  followed him inside;\n\nonly one of the  officers, state trooper Dockrey, was  in uniform\n\nand  carrying  a visible  weapon.   A  fifth officer  watched the\n\nentire  exchange, unseen,  from  a  distance.    As  the  quartet\n\napproached  appellant,   Trooper  Dockrey  placed  his   palm  on\n\nappellant's back for two or three seconds, gestured away from the\n\ncrowd, and politely asked appellant  to accompany the officers to\n\na  secluded corner  of the  restaurant.   Appellant complied.   A\n\ndiscussion  ensued.   When  appellant  stated  that he  had  been\n\ndropped off at the rest area by anonymous \"friends,\" the officers\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The   trial  record   reflects,  and   appellant's  counsel\nconfirmed at oral argument, that  contrary to the more  prevalent\nHispanic  custom appellant prefers to  use the last  of his given\nnames as his surname.  We will, therefore, honor his nomenclative\npreference and refer to him as \"Zapata.\"\n\n     2In Massachusetts,  it is unlawful  to operate  on a  public\nhighway a motor vehicle that is unregistered, see Mass. Gen. Laws\r                                                           \nch. 90,   9 (1986), or one that is uninsured, see id.   34J.\r                                                               \n\n                                3\r\n\ninformed  him  that they  knew  this  to be  a  lie.   They  then\n\nsuggested that appellant accompany them to the parking lot.  Once\n\nagain, appellant  agreeably acquiesced.   The party  proceeded to\n\nthe spot where appellant  had parked the vehicle in  which he had\n\narrived.\n\n          The  officers  inquired   if  they  might   search  the\n\nautomobile    but they  did not  tell appellant that  he had  the\n\nright  to withhold  his consent.    Appellant replied,  \"Sure, go\n\nahead,\" and, upon  request, relinquished the keys.   The officers\n\nfound  the  two duffel  bags  in the  trunk.   In  response  to a\n\nquestion,  appellant denied knowing who  owned them.   One of the\n\nbags  was partially unzipped.  Through  the opening, the officers\n\nspied a type of  packaging commonly used for cocaine.  An officer\n\nremoved the  package,  dropped it  onto  the nearby  fender,  and\n\nwatched   as  it  emitted  a  puff  of  white  powder.    Further\n\nexamination disclosed approximately 25  kilograms of cocaine.  At\n\nthat point,  the DEA  agents arrested appellant,  handcuffed him,\n\nand read his Miranda rights once in Spanish and twice in English.\r                              \n\nAppellant promptly confessed that he was en route to a rendezvous\n\nwith drug traffickers.\n\nII.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r          II.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n\n          On  February 26, 1992, a  federal grand jury returned a\n\ntwo-count indictment  charging Zapata  and two  codefendants with\n\nconspiracy to possess cocaine,  intending to distribute the drug,\n\nand  with the underlying substantive  offense.  See  21 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \n\n846, 841(a)(1); see also 18 U.S.C.   2 (aiding and abetting).  On\r                                  \n\n                                4\r\n\nMarch 26, Zapata  filed a motion to suppress  in which he claimed\n\nan  illegal search  and seizure.   He  sought to  suppress, inter\r                                                                           \n\nalia, the cocaine found  in the automobile and the  statements he\r              \n\nhad made to law enforcement officers after his arrest.\n\n          Following  a three-day  evidentiary hearing,  the court\n\nbelow concluded  that, when  the  officers originally  approached\n\nappellant,  they   had  a   satisfactory  basis  for   reasonable\n\nsuspicion.   In light of  the factual predicate    the informer's\n\ntip,  the  observations made  during  the  surveillance, and  the\n\nelusive manner  in which  appellant drove to  the rest area    we\n\nregard this finding as irreproachable.   See, e.g., United States\r                                                                           \n\nv.  Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7-8  (1989) (explaining that \"reasonable\r                     \n\nsuspicion\" sufficient  to undergird  investigatory  stop must  be\n\nbased on  \"articulable  facts\" drawn  from \"the  totality of  the\n\ncircumstances\"); United  States v. Villanueva,      F.3d    ,    \r                                                       \n\n(1st  Cir. 1994) [No. 93-1502, slip op.  at 5] (similar).  And we\n\nnote that the officers' suspicions were understandably heightened\n\nas events at the rest area unfolded.\n\n          Turning  to  the nature  of  the  detention, the  court\n\npointed out  that, in the  initial encounter, the  police neither\n\nrestricted appellant's movements nor  prevented him from  leaving\n\nthe  scene.    At all  times,  the  officers'  demeanor was  non-\n\ncoercive; they spoke courteously,  in low, non-threatening tones,\n\nand   with  the lone  exception of Trooper  Dockrey's pat on  the\n\nback    refrained  from  touching appellant,  encircling him,  or\n\nbrandishing  their  weapons.    The court  also  determined  that\n\n                                5\r\n\nappellant fully understood what  was happening, and \"seemed eager\n\nto  cooperate.\"  In sum, the initial detention amounted merely to\n\nan investigatory stop, justified  by reasonable suspicion.3  See,\r                                                                          \n\ne.g.,  Terry, 392 U.S. at 21; United States v. Streifel, 781 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n953, 957 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          Taking matters  a step  further, the court  ruled that,\n\nbecause  appellant voluntarily  consented to  the car  search, no\n\nbasis  existed for suppression of the items taken from the trunk.\n\nThe  court also  ruled  appellant's confession  to be  admissible\n\nbecause he had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\nincrimination  in  compliance  with  the   Miranda  requirements.\r                                                            \n\nAccordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress.\n\n          Thereafter, a  jury  found  appellant  guilty  on  both\n\ncounts of the indictment.  On March 16,  1993, the district court\n\nimposed  a  ten-year incarcerative  sentence.    In this  appeal,\n\nappellant contests only the denial of his suppression motion.\n\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          A  district court's  findings of  fact on  a motion  to\n\nsuppress are reviewable only  for clear error as to  consent, see\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States v.  Miller, 589  F.2d 1117, 1130  (1st Cir.  1978),\r                                  \n\ncert. denied,  440 U.S. 958  (1979), probable  cause, see  United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v. Aguirre,  839 F.2d 854,  857 (1st  Cir. 1988), and  all\r                           \n\nother factbound  matters, see, e.g., United  States v. Rutkowski,\r                                                                          \n                    \r                              \n\n     3The court also found that, had the initial seizure risen to\nthe  level of  an  arrest, it  would  have been  illegal  because\nprobable cause  did not exist at that  time.  The government says\nthat this finding is  patently erroneous.  We need  not reach the\nquestion and take no view of it.\n\n                                6\r\n\n877  F.2d 139,  141 (1st Cir.  1989) (reviewing  district court's\n\nfindings as to applicability of  \"plain view\" exception under the\n\n\"clearly erroneous\" rule).   This  deferential standard  requires\n\nthat an appellate  court exhibit great respect for the presider's\n\nopportunity  to  hear  the  testimony,  observe  the   witnesses'\n\ndemeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand.\n\n          Notwithstanding  the  deference   with  which   factual\n\nfindings are to be treated, questions of law remain subject to de\r                                                                           \n\nnovo review.   This phenomenon sets the  stage for a more nuanced\r              \n\nstatement of appellate  practice in Fourth  Amendment cases.   In\n\nscrutinizing a  district court's denial of  a suppression motion,\n\nthe  court  of appeals  will review  findings  of fact  for clear\n\nerror, while  at  the  same time  subjecting  the  trial  court's\n\nultimate constitutional  conclusions to  plenary oversight.   See\r                                                                           \n\nUnited  States v. Infante-Ruiz,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1994)\r                                        \n\n[No. 93-1175, slip op. at 4];  United States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n110, 112 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nIV.  ANALYSIS\r          IV.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Appellant argues that the initial seizure of his person\n\namounted  to a  de  facto arrest;  that  he did  not  voluntarily\r                                   \n\nconsent to  the subsequent search;  that the contraband  found in\n\nthe  car's trunk would not  necessarily have been discovered; and\n\nthat the illegal practices in  which the agents engaged  rendered\n\nboth  the  fruits  of  the  search  and  the  ensuing  confession\n\ninadmissible.   We  subdivide this  multi-layered  argument  into\n\nseveral components.\n\n                                7\r\n\n                    A.  The Initial Encounter.\r                              A.  The Initial Encounter.\r                                                       \n\n          There is no scientifically precise formula that enables\n\ncourts to  distinguish between investigatory stops,  which can be\n\njustified by reasonable suspicion,  and other detentions that the\n\nlaw  deems  sufficiently coercive  to  require  probable cause   \n\ndetentions  that are  sometimes called  \"de facto arrests.\"   See\r                                                                           \n\nFlorida v. Royer,  460 U.S.  491, 506 (1983)  (opinion of  White,\r                          \n\nJ.); United States  v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156  (1st Cir. 1987).\r                                      \n\nThe  conventional method  of  classification in  respect to  such\n\ndetentions consists of  asking whether \"a  reasonable man in  the\n\nsuspect's position  would have understood his  situation,\" in the\n\ncircumstances  then obtaining,  to be  tantamount to  being under\n\narrest.   Berkemer v. McCarty,  468 U.S. 420,  442 (1984); accord\r                                                                           \n\nQuinn, 815 F.2d at 157.   In suggesting an affirmative answer  to\r               \n\nthis inquiry,  appellant highlights two arguably  coercive facts:\n\nthe presence of five lawmen and the physical touching effected by\n\nTrooper Dockrey.\n\n          Despite these  circumstances,  we cannot  say that  the\n\ndistrict  court  erred in  assessing  the  initial encounter  and\n\nconcluding  that  a reasonable  person,  standing in  appellant's\n\nshoes, would have felt unrestrained.  The encounter occurred in a\n\npublic place.  Most of the officers were in plain clothes.  Their\n\napproach  was measured,  their  words polite,  their conduct  not\n\nbellicose.   They  neither  voiced threats  nor brandished  their\n\nweapons.  Certainly, the atmosphere at the scene was visibly less\n\ncoercive  than  in  Quinn, a  case  in  which  we overturned  the\r                                   \n\n                                8\r\n\ndistrict  court's finding  that  a reasonable  person would  have\n\nthought himself  under arrest given  the presence of  five police\n\nofficers,  a sniffing dog, and a  vehicle obstructing egress, see\r                                                                           \n\nQuinn, 815 F.2d at 155.  Taking into account the  full panoply of\r               \n\nrelevant  facts, including  the  demeanor and  deportment of  the\n\ninvestigating officers and the tenor of their remarks, we cannot,\n\nwithout more, set aside the trial  court's supported finding that\n\nthe  initial encounter  did not  function as  a de  facto arrest.\r                                                                   \n\nMere numbers  do not  automatically convert  a lawful  Terry stop\r                                                                      \n\ninto something more forbidding.\n\n          Nonetheless, the government is  not entirely out of the\n\nwoods.   Appellant,  adverting to  the slight  physical touching,\n\nconstructs  an  arresting  argument  based  on  certain  language\n\ncontained  in California v.  Hodari D., 499 U.S.  621 (1991).  In\r                                                \n\nHodari,  a  group  of  youths  who  were  under  no  suspicion   \r                \n\nreasonable  or otherwise    panicked  and ran  when a  patrol car\n\npassed.  The police pursued.   During the chase, Hodari    one of\n\nthe fleeing youths   discarded  a \"rock\" of crack cocaine.   Soon\n\nafter, a police  officer tackled him.   See id.  at 622-23.   The\r                                                         \n\ngovernment charged  Hodari with  a narcotics offense  and offered\n\nthe cocaine as evidence against him.  The jury found him guilty.\n\n          On appeal, Hodari challenged  the government's right to\n\nintroduce the evidence.  Its admissibility turned on the question\n\nof when  the police  \"seized\" Hodari    at  the moment the  chase\n\nbegan or at the time of the tackle.   See id. at 623-24.  Justice\r                                                       \n\nScalia,  writing  for  the  Court,  stated  that  an  arrest  may\n\n                                9\r\n\ntranspire  in  one  of two  ways:    \"An  arrest requires  either\r                                                                           \n\nphysical force  . . . or, where that is absent, submission to the\r                                                                    \n\nassertion  of authority.\"    Id. at  626.   Despite  the  seeming\r                                          \n\nbreadth  of  this language,  it  is important  to  recognize that\n\nHodari focused on the second branch of  this disjunctive furcula;\r                \n\nthe  Court made new law by  holding that, absent force, a seizure\n\nis not effected until the suspect has submitted.  See id.\r                                                                   \n\n          Appellant attempts to stretch  Hodari past the breaking\r                                                         \n\npoint.  He uses as a  lever the Court's statement that \"an arrest\n\nis effected by the slightest application of physical force.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \n\nat  625.   Suggesting  that  this  statement be  read  literally,\n\nappellant urges that courts must find an illegal arrest whenever,\n\nin the  absence of  probable cause,  the most ephemeral  physical\n\ncontact is made between a police officer and a suspect.\n\n          This construct  is not  original.  The  Seventh Circuit\n\nrecently rejected  a virtually identical argument,  holding that,\n\nHodari notwithstanding, a  constructive arrest  occurs only  when\r                \n\nthe  touch first effects a seizure, but not when an investigatory\n\nstop (itself  a form of  seizure) is  already in progress  at the\n\ntime of the contact.   See United States v. Weaver, 8  F.3d 1240,\r                                                            \n\n1244-45  (7th Cir.  1993).   We believe  that Weaver  reaches the\r                                                              \n\ncorrect  result and  that  there  is  a  simple,  direct  way  to\n\nreconcile Hodari with cases involving Terry stops.\r                                                     \n\n          In Hodari, Justice Scalia used the term \"arrest\" in its\r                             \n\ncommon  law sense.    He  understood  common  law  arrest  to  be\n\ncoterminous  with  the  modern  conception  of  \"seizure  of  the\n\n                                10\r\n\nperson.\"   Hodari, 499 U.S. at  627 n.3.  The  Court neglected to\r                           \n\ndistinguish between  different types of seizures,  presumably for\n\ntwo  reasons:  the distinction was not directly relevant, and, in\n\nany event, the Court's decision rested exclusively on authorities\n\ndating from  the pre-Terry era    an  era when there  was perfect\r                                    \n\ncongruence  between the terms \"arrest\" and \"seizure.\"  See id. at\r                                                                        \n\n624-27.  Properly understood,  the passage  in Hodari  upon which\r                                                               \n\nappellant  relies  merely restates  the  traditional  test for  a\n\nseizure.  See,  e.g., Terry, 392 U.S. at 19  n.16 (\"Only when the\r                                     \n\nofficer, by means  of physical force or show of authority, has in\n\nsome way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that\n\na `seizure' has occurred.\").  Hodari's solitary innovation  is to\r                                              \n\nadd the requirement  that the  suspect submit.   See Hodari,  499\r                                                                     \n\nU.S. at 626.\n\n          Glimpsed in  this light, Hodari cannot  bear the weight\r                                                   \n\nthat appellant piles upon it.  After all, \"[o]ur Fourth Amendment\n\njurisprudence has  long  recognized that  the  right to  make  an\n\narrest  or investigatory  stop  necessarily carries  with it  the\r                                        \n\nright  to use  some  degree of  physical  coercion.\"   Graham  v.\r                                                                       \n\nConnor, 490  U.S. 386, 395  (1989) (emphasis supplied).   Indeed,\r                \n\nthe  concept of an investigatory stop  was conceived and nurtured\n\nin  cases involving protective pat-downs,  see Terry, 392 U.S. at\r                                                              \n\n20-30; Ballou  v.

Then,   too,  the   Court  has   consistently\n\n                                11\r\n\ncharacterized actions  far more  corporal than mere  touchings as\n\nproper investigatory accouterments, see,  e.g., Sokolow, 490 U.S.\r                                                                 \n\nat 7 (upholding investigatory  stop although officers grabbed the\n\nsuspect by  the arm and  moved him onto  the sidewalk); see  also\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States v.

Given  both  the   persuasiveness  and  the\n\nprevalence of  these precedents, we  join the Seventh  Circuit in\n\nrejecting the notion that an unheralded dictum in Hodari worked a\r                                                                  \n\nsea  change in the law  by imposing a  probable cause requirement\n\nfor all de minimis  uses of force, including those  incidental to\r                            \n\nlegitimate Terry stops.\r                          \n\n          On this understanding of Hodari, we cannot say that the\r                                                   \n\nlower court erred in concluding that no de facto arrest occurred.\r                                                          \n\nAlthough  an  officer  did  touch appellant,  that  datum  merely\n\nestablishes that a seizure  occurred; it does not dispose  of the\n\nquestion of what sort of  seizure took place.4  What  is decisive\n\nin  this case  is  that nothing  the officers  did,  alone or  in\n\ncombination, including the modest laying-on of hands, sufficed to\n\nconvert  the  investigatory  stop  already in  progress  into  an\n\narrest.  See, e.g., United States v.  Willis, 967 F.2d 1220, 1223\r                                                      \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     4Of  course, the fact of physical contact is relevant to the\nreasonableness of a suspect's perception that he is under arrest.\nSee United States v. Perea, 986 F.2d 633, 645 (2d Cir. 1993).  In\r                                    \nthis case,  the district court, after  factoring this information\ninto the calculus,  determined that no de facto  arrest occurred.\r                                                         \nThat exercise in factfinding did not constitute clear error.\n\n                                12\r\n\n(8th  Cir.  1992)  (holding,  post-Hodari, that  patting  down  a\r                                                   \n\nsuspect does not  automatically convert  a Terry stop  into a  de\r                                                                           \n\nfacto  arrest); Tom v.

We do  not agree.   The court had  before it\n\nevidence  of  express consent,  along  with  evidence of  consent\n\ninferable from conduct.  Appellant freely surrendered the keys to\n\nboth  the doors and the trunk; and it is settled law that the act\n\nof  handing  over one's  car keys,  if  uncoerced, may  in itself\n\nsupport  an  inference of  consent to  search  the vehicle.   See\r                                                                           \n\nUnited  States v.

It is equally well settled that a general\n\nconsent  to search a motor  vehicle subsumes the specific consent\n\nto search  any easily  accessible containers within  the vehicle.\n\nSee, e.g., Florida v.

Although appellant harps on the  officers'\n\nfailure to inform him of his right to refuse permission, the rule\n\nis that  a failure  to inform  a suspect that  he is  entitled to\n\nwithhold  his consent to a vehicle search, though relevant to the\n\nissue of voluntariness, does not  preclude a finding of  consent.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Schneckcloth v.

What is  more, there  is a  synergistic effect  at work\n\nhere, in that appellant's disclaimer of any ownership interest in\n\nthe bags strengthens the case for  a finding of consent.

Contrary to appellant's importuning, we hold that the Supreme Court's opinion in California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991), did not reconfigure the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and, therefore, did not transmogrify the law governing investigatory stops.  Thus, we conclude on the facts of this case that a slight physical touching by a police officer, effected under circumstances falling short of probable cause, did not in itself transform a lawful Terry stop into an unlawful de facto arrest.  Discerning no clear error in the district court's remaining findings--that defendant consented to the challenged search (a search that yielded evidence which in any event inevitably would have been discovered) and that neither the seized evidence nor the statements to the police should be suppressed--we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We offer a decurtate summary of the events pertinent to this appeal, recounting them in a manner consistent with the district court's supportable findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon being alerted by a reliable informant about narcotics-related activity at a certain dwelling in Lowell, Massachusetts, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) mounted a surveillance.  On February 4, 1992, federal agents observed defendant-appellant Walter DeJesus Zapata drive from the site of the surveillance to another address.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He entered a house at that address and helped to load two duffel bags into the trunk of a second car.  Appellant departed in the laden vehicle.  He drove in an unorthodox manner, bobbing, weaving, continually changing lanes, and alternating driving speeds.  Finally, he swerved sharply from a high-speed throughway into an adjacent rest area, without signalling.  The trailing DEA agent followed and radioed for help.  By this time, the authorities had verified that the car driven by appellant was unregistered and uninsured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant left his vehicle and entered a fast-food restaurant.  Four law enforcement officers followed him inside;  only one of the officers, state trooper Dockrey, was in uniform and carrying a visible weapon.  A fifth officer watched the entire exchange, unseen, from a distance.  As the quartet approached appellant, Trooper Dockrey placed his palm on appellant's back for two or three seconds, gestured away from the crowd, and politely asked appellant to accompany the officers to a secluded corner of the restaurant.  Appellant complied.  A discussion ensued.  When appellant stated that he had been dropped off at the rest area by anonymous \"friends,\" the officers informed him that they knew this to be a lie.  They then suggested that appellant accompany them to the parking lot.  Once again, appellant agreeably acquiesced.  The party proceeded to the spot where appellant had parked the vehicle in which he had arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers inquired if they might search the automobile--but they did not tell appellant that he had the right to withhold his consent.  Appellant replied, \"Sure, go ahead,\" and, upon request, relinquished the keys.  The officers found the two duffel bags in the trunk.  In response to a question, appellant denied knowing who owned them.  One of the bags was partially unzipped.  Through the opening, the officers spied a type of packaging commonly used for cocaine.  An officer removed the package, dropped it onto the nearby fender, and watched as it emitted a puff of white powder.  Further examination disclosed approximately 25 kilograms of cocaine.  At that point, the DEA agents arrested appellant, handcuffed him, and read his Miranda rights once in Spanish and twice in English.  Appellant promptly confessed that he was en route to a rendezvous with drug traffickers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 1992, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Zapata and two codefendants with conspiracy to possess cocaine, intending to distribute the drug, and with the underlying substantive offense.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1);  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (aiding and abetting).  On March 26, Zapata filed a motion to suppress in which he claimed an illegal search and seizure.  He sought to suppress, inter alia, the cocaine found in the automobile and the statements he had made to law enforcement officers after his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a three-day evidentiary hearing, the court below concluded that, when the officers originally approached appellant, they had a satisfactory basis for reasonable suspicion.  In light of the factual predicate--the informer's tip, the observations made during the surveillance, and the elusive manner in which appellant drove to the rest area--we regard this finding as irreproachable.  See, e.g., United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7-8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (explaining that \"reasonable suspicion\" sufficient to undergird investigatory stop must be based on \"articulable facts\" drawn from \"the totality of the circumstances\");  United States v. Villanueva, 15 F.3d 197, 199 (1st Cir.1994) (similar).  And we note that the officers' suspicions were understandably heightened as events at the rest area unfolded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the nature of the detention, the court pointed out that, in the initial encounter, the police neither restricted appellant's movements nor prevented him from leaving the scene.  At all times, the officers' demeanor was non-coercive;  they spoke courteously, in low, non-threatening tones, and--with the lone exception of Trooper Dockrey's pat on the back--refrained from touching appellant, encircling him, or brandishing their weapons.  The court also determined that appellant fully understood what was happening, and \"seemed eager to cooperate.\"   In sum, the initial detention amounted merely to an investigatory stop, justified by reasonable suspicion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80;  United States v. Streifel, 781 F.2d 953, 957 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking matters a step further, the court ruled that, because appellant voluntarily consented to the car search, no basis existed for suppression of the items taken from the trunk.  The court also ruled appellant's confession to be admissible because he had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in compliance with the Miranda requirements.  Accordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a jury found appellant guilty on both counts of the indictment.  On March 16, 1993, the district court imposed a ten-year incarcerative sentence.  In this appeal, appellant contests only the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's findings of fact on a motion to suppress are reviewable only for clear error as to consent, see United States v. Miller, 589 F.2d 1117, 1130 (1st Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 1499, 59 L.Ed.2d 771 (1979), probable cause, see United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857 (1st Cir.1988), and all other factbound matters, see, e.g., United States v. Rutkowski, 877 F.2d 139, 141 (1st Cir.1989) (reviewing district court's findings as to applicability of \"plain view\" exception under the \"clearly erroneous\" rule).  This deferential standard requires that an appellate court exhibit great respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony, observe the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the deference with which factual findings are to be treated, questions of law remain subject to de novo review.  This phenomenon sets the stage for a more nuanced statement of appellate practice in Fourth Amendment cases.  In scrutinizing a district court's denial of a suppression motion, the court of appeals will review findings of fact for clear error, while at the same time subjecting the trial court's ultimate constitutional conclusions to plenary oversight.  See United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 501 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d 110, 112 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the initial seizure of his person amounted to a de facto arrest;  that he did not voluntarily consent to the subsequent search;  that the contraband found in the car's trunk would not necessarily have been discovered;  and that the illegal practices in which the agents engaged rendered both the fruits of the search and the ensuing confession inadmissible.  We subdivide this multi-layered argument into several components.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. The Initial Encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no scientifically precise formula that enables courts to distinguish between investigatory stops, which can be justified by reasonable suspicion, and other detentions that the law deems sufficiently coercive to require probable cause--detentions that are sometimes called \"de facto arrests.\"   See Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 506, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1329, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (opinion of White, J.);  United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1987).  The conventional method of classification in respect to such detentions consists of asking whether \"a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation,\" in the circumstances then obtaining, to be tantamount to being under arrest.  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3151-52, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984);  accord Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157.   In suggesting an affirmative answer to this inquiry, appellant highlights two arguably coercive facts:  the presence of five lawmen and the physical touching effected by Trooper Dockrey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court erred in assessing the initial encounter and concluding that a reasonable person, standing in appellant's shoes, would have felt unrestrained.  The encounter occurred in a public place.  Most of the officers were in plain clothes.  Their approach was measured, their words polite, their conduct not bellicose.  They neither voiced threats nor brandished their weapons.  Certainly, the atmosphere at the scene was visibly less coercive than in Quinn, a case in which we overturned the district court's finding that a reasonable person would have thought himself under arrest given the presence of five police officers, a sniffing dog, and a vehicle obstructing egress, see Quinn, 815 F.2d at 155.   Taking into account the full panoply of relevant facts, including the demeanor and deportment of the investigating officers and the tenor of their remarks, we cannot, without more, set aside the trial court's supported finding that the initial encounter did not function as a de facto arrest. Mere numbers do not automatically convert a lawful Terry stop into something more forbidding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the government is not entirely out of the woods.  Appellant, adverting to the slight physical touching, constructs an arresting argument based on certain language contained in California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991).  In Hodari, a group of youths who were under no suspicion--reasonable or otherwise--panicked and ran when a patrol car passed.  The police pursued.  During the chase, Hodari--one of the fleeing youths--discarded a \"rock\" of crack cocaine.  Soon after, a police officer tackled him.  See id. at 622-23, 111 S.Ct. at 1548-49.   The government charged Hodari with a narcotics offense and offered the cocaine as evidence against him.  The jury found him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodari challenged the government's right to introduce the evidence.  Its admissibility turned on the question of when the police \"seized\" Hodari--at the moment the chase began or at the time of the tackle.  See id. at 623-24, 111 S.Ct. at 1549-50.   Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, stated that an arrest may transpire in one of two ways:  \"An arrest requires either physical force ... or, where that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority.\"  Id. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1551.   Despite the seeming breadth of this language, it is important to recognize that Hodari focused on the second branch of this disjunctive furcula;  the Court made new law by holding that, absent force, a seizure is not effected until the suspect has submitted.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant attempts to stretch Hodari past the breaking point.  He uses as a lever the Court's statement that \"an arrest is effected by the slightest application of physical force.\"  Id. at 625, 111 S.Ct. at 1550.   Suggesting that this statement be read literally, appellant urges that courts must find an illegal arrest whenever, in the absence of probable cause, the most ephemeral physical contact is made between a police officer and a suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct is not original.  The Seventh Circuit recently rejected a virtually identical argument, holding that, Hodari notwithstanding, a constructive arrest occurs only when the touch first effects a seizure, but not when an investigatory stop (itself a form of seizure) is already in progress at the time of the contact.  See United States v. Weaver, 8 F.3d 1240, 1244-45 (7th Cir.1993).  We believe that Weaver reaches the correct result and that there is a simple, direct way to reconcile Hodari with cases involving Terry stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hodari, Justice Scalia used the term \"arrest\" in its common law sense.  He understood common law arrest to be coterminous with the modern conception of \"seizure of the person.\"  Hodari, 499 U.S. at 627 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. at 1551 n. 3.   The Court neglected to distinguish between different types of seizures, presumably for two reasons:  the distinction was not directly relevant, and, in any event, the Court's decision rested exclusively on authorities dating from the pre-Terry era--an era when there was perfect congruence between the terms \"arrest\" and \"seizure.\"   See id. at 624-27, 111 S.Ct. at 1549-51.   Properly understood, the passage in Hodari upon which appellant relies merely restates the traditional test for a seizure.  See, e.g., Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16 (\"Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a 'seizure' has occurred.\").  Hodari's solitary innovation is to add the requirement that the suspect submit.  See Hodari, 499 U.S. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glimpsed in this light, Hodari cannot bear the weight that appellant piles upon it.  After all, \"[o]ur Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion.\"  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (emphasis supplied).  Indeed, the concept of an investigatory stop was conceived and nurtured in cases involving protective pat-downs, see Terry, 392 U.S. at 20-30, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-85;  Ballou v. Massachusetts, 403 F.2d 982, 985 (1st Cir.1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 909, 89 S.Ct. 1024, 22 L.Ed.2d 222 (1969), and it is by definition impossible to frisk or pat down a suspect without physically touching him.  Then, too, the Court has consistently characterized actions far more corporal than mere touchings as proper investigatory accoutrements, see, e.g., Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585 (upholding investigatory stop although officers grabbed the suspect by the arm and moved him onto the sidewalk);  see also United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 534, 541, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3310-11, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (upholding relatively intrusive border search of defendant's person without requiring an antecedent showing of probable cause).  Given both the persuasiveness and the prevalence of these precedents, we join the Seventh Circuit in rejecting the notion that an unheralded dictum in Hodari worked a sea change in the law by imposing a probable cause requirement for all de minimis uses of force, including those incidental to legitimate Terry stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this understanding of Hodari, we cannot say that the lower court erred in concluding that no de facto arrest occurred.  Although an officer did touch appellant, that datum merely establishes that a seizure occurred;  it does not dispose of the question of what sort of seizure took place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  What is decisive in this case is that nothing the officers did, alone or in combination, including the modest laying-on of hands, sufficed to convert the investigatory stop already in progress into an arrest.  See, e.g., United States v. Willis, 967 F.2d 1220, 1223 (8th Cir.1992) (holding, post-Hodari, that patting down a suspect does not automatically convert a Terry stop into a de facto arrest);  Tom v. Voida, 963 F.2d 952, 958 (7th Cir.1992) (similar;  handcuffing of suspect does not automatically convert Terry stop into de facto arrest).  Since there is no serious doubt that reasonable suspicion existed at the time of the stop--the totality of the circumstances plainly supports the lower court's assessment--the \"seizure\" in this case was lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B. Voluntariness of Consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant asseverates that the district court erred in concluding that he voluntarily consented to the automobile search.  We do not agree.  The court had before it evidence of express consent, along with evidence of consent inferable from conduct.  Appellant freely surrendered the keys to both the doors and the trunk;  and it is settled law that the act of handing over one's car keys, if uncoerced, may in itself support an inference of consent to search the vehicle.  See United States v. Patrone, 948 F.2d 813, 816 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2953, 119 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992);  see also Miller, 589 F.2d at 1131 (holding to like effect when defendant unlocked his vehicle upon request).  It is equally well settled that a general consent to search a motor vehicle subsumes the specific consent to search any easily accessible containers within the vehicle.  See, e.g., Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251-52, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1804, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing occurred in this case to neutralize the inference of consent.  Although appellant harps on the officers' failure to inform him of his right to refuse permission, the rule is that a failure to inform a suspect that he is entitled to withhold his consent to a vehicle search, though relevant to the issue of voluntariness, does not preclude a finding of consent.  See, e.g., Schneckcloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 231-32, 249, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2049-50, 2059, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973);  United States v. Lopez, 911 F.2d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v. Crespo, 834 F.2d 267, 271-72 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1007, 108 S.Ct. 1471, 99 L.Ed.2d 700 (1988);  United States v. Lemon, 550 F.2d 467, 472 n. 5 (9th Cir.1977);  Leeper v. United States, 446 F.2d 281, 284 (10th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1021, 92 S.Ct. 695, 30 L.Ed.2d 671 (1972);  United States ex rel. Harris v. Hendricks, 423 F.2d 1096, 1101 (3d Cir.1970);  Gorman v. United States, 380 F.2d 158, 164 (1st Cir.1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the duffel bags were lying in the trunk, appellant's general consent to a search of the automobile constituted consent to a search of the duffel bags.  See Jimeno, 500 U.S. at 251-52, 111 S.Ct. at 1804;  United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170-71, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982).  What is more, there is a synergistic effect at work here, in that appellant's disclaimer of any ownership interest in the bags strengthens the case for a finding of consent.  One who abandons ownership forfeits any entitlement to rights of privacy in the abandoned property, see Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 240-41, 80 S.Ct. 683, 697-98, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960), and one who disclaims ownership is likely to be found to have abandoned ownership,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> see, e.g., United States v. Santos Ferrer, 999 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 562, 126 L.Ed.2d 462 (1992);  United States v. Torres, 949 F.2d 606, 608 (2d Cir.1991);  United States v. Frazier, 936 F.2d 262, 264-65 (6th Cir.1991);  United States v. Ruiz, 935 F.2d 982, 984 (8th Cir.1991);  United States v. Sweeting, 933 F.2d 962, 964 (11th Cir.1991).  Phrased another way, disclaiming ownership is tantamount to declaring indifference, and thus negates the existence of any privacy concern in a container's contents.  See Miller, 589 F.2d at 1131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>C. Inevitable Discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the defendant's consent were somehow tainted, and the search invalid, suppression would not lie in this instance for the contraband inevitably would have been discovered.  Evidence which comes to light by unlawful means nonetheless can be used at trial if it ineluctably would have been revealed in some other (lawful) way, see Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 448, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2511, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984);  Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d at 503, so long as (i) the lawful means of its discovery are independent and would necessarily have been employed, (ii) discovery by that means is in fact inevitable, and (iii) application of the doctrine in a particular case will not sully the prophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment.  See United States v. Silvestri, 787 F.2d 736, 744 (1st Cir.1986), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1233, 108 S.Ct. 2897, 101 L.Ed.2d 931 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all the relevant criteria are satisfied.  The record establishes unequivocally that the car containing the contraband was unregistered and uninsured.  Because the car could not lawfully be driven on a public highway, see supra note 2, the state police surely would have impounded it and, in accordance with standard practice, conducted a routine inventory search.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In the process, the two large bags of cocaine in the vehicle's trunk would certainly have come to light.  Courts have regularly approved inventory searches of impounded motor vehicles despite the absence of probable cause, see, e.g., Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S. 367, 371, 107 S.Ct. 738, 740-41, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987);  United States v. Ramos-Morales, 981 F.2d 625, 626 (1st Cir.1992) (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2384, 124 L.Ed.2d 287 (1993);  United States v.

Trullo, 790 F.2d 205, 206 (1st Cir.1986), and, by like token, courts often have held that evidence which would have turned up during an inventory search comes under the umbrella of the inevitable discovery rule, see, e.g., United States v. Seals, 987 F.2d 1102, 1107-08 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 155, 126 L.Ed.2d 116 (1993);  United States v. Horn, 970 F.2d 728, 732 (10th Cir.1992);  United States v.

George, 971 F.2d 1113, 1121 (4th Cir.1992) (agreeing in theory);  United States v. Jenkins, 876 F.2d 1085, 1088 (2d Cir.1989) (same).  At least one court has so ruled under circumstances hauntingly reminiscent of the circumstances at hand.  See People v. Nelson, 127 Misc.2d 583, 486 N.Y.S.2d 979, 983-84 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1985) (holding discovery of evidence inevitable because police had a right to impound, and conduct an inventory search of, an apparently unregistered, uninspected, and uninsured vehicle driven on a public highway).  We discern no valid reason why the same result should not obtain in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>D.

See United States v. Perea, 986 F.2d 633, 645 (2d Cir.1993).  In this case, the district court, after factoring this information into the calculus, determined that no de facto arrest occurred.  That exercise in factfinding did not constitute clear error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that this principle is totally consistent with the precept that ownership and a subjective expectation of privacy are among the key factors that trigger the right to privacy.  See Aguirre, 839 F.2d at 856-57 (citing other cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> An inventory search is a wholly independent legal procedure serving legitimate governmental ends and circumscribed by standardized rules.

Here, pursuit of that means was ongoing, in the sense that, by the time of the search, the authorities had already secured the critical information concerning the car.  The fact that legal means of discovery are underway at the time an unlawful search transpires is highly relevant to, though not a requisite of, the inevitable discovery inquiry.  See Silvestri, 787 F.2d at 746</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We decline to embrace the suggestion that courts should confine the inevitable discovery rule to cases in which the disputed evidence comprises a derivative, rather than primary, fruit of unlawful police conduct.  See United States v. $639,558 in United States Currency, 955 F.2d 712, 718-21 (D.C.Cir.1992).  Although the Nix case involved derivative evidence, we regard its rationale--that the exclusion of inevitably discovered evidence would \"put the government in a worse position\" than if no illegality had occurred, Nix, 467 U.S. at 443, 104 S.Ct. at 2509--to be fully applicable to cases involving primary evidence.  And we are thrice fortified in this conclusion:  by the Nix Court's approving citation to cases that had applied the rule in the context of primary evidence, see id. at 440 n. 2, 104 S.Ct. at 2507 n. 2 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Apker, 705 F.2d 293 (8th Cir.1983);  United States v. Romero, 692 F.2d 699 (10th Cir.1982);  and United States v. Roper, 681 F.2d 1354 (11th Cir.1982));  by the Court's subsequent endorsement of the closely related \"independent source\" rule in a case involving primary evidence, see Murray v.

Contrary to appellant's importuning, we hold that the Supreme Court's opinion in California v. Hodari D., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, we conclude on the facts of this case that a slight physical touching by a police officer, effected under circumstances falling short of probable cause, did not in itself transform a lawful Terry stop into an unlawful de facto arrest.  Discerning no clear error in the district court's remaining findings--that defendant consented to the challenged search (a search that yielded evidence which in any event inevitably would have been discovered) and that neither the seized evidence nor the statements to the police should be suppressed--we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We offer a decurtate summary of the events pertinent to this appeal, recounting them in a manner consistent with the district court's supportable findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon being alerted by a reliable informant about narcotics-related activity at a certain dwelling in Lowell, Massachusetts, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) mounted a surveillance.  On February 4, 1992, federal agents observed defendant-appellant Walter DeJesus Zapata drive from the site of the surveillance to another address.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He entered a house at that address and helped to load two duffel bags into the trunk of a second car.  Appellant departed in the laden vehicle.  He drove in an unorthodox manner, bobbing, weaving, continually changing lanes, and alternating driving speeds.  Finally, he swerved sharply from a high-speed throughway into an adjacent rest area, without signalling.  The trailing DEA agent followed and radioed for help.  By this time, the authorities had verified that the car driven by appellant was unregistered and uninsured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant left his vehicle and entered a fast-food restaurant.  Four law enforcement officers followed him inside;  only one of the officers, state trooper Dockrey, was in uniform and carrying a visible weapon.  A fifth officer watched the entire exchange, unseen, from a distance.  As the quartet approached appellant, Trooper Dockrey placed his palm on appellant's back for two or three seconds, gestured away from the crowd, and politely asked appellant to accompany the officers to a secluded corner of the restaurant.  Appellant complied.  A discussion ensued.  When appellant stated that he had been dropped off at the rest area by anonymous \"friends,\" the officers informed him that they knew this to be a lie.  They then suggested that appellant accompany them to the parking lot.  Once again, appellant agreeably acquiesced.  The party proceeded to the spot where appellant had parked the vehicle in which he had arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers inquired if they might search the automobile--but they did not tell appellant that he had the right to withhold his consent.  Appellant replied, \"Sure, go ahead,\" and, upon request, relinquished the keys.  The officers found the two duffel bags in the trunk.  In response to a question, appellant denied knowing who owned them.  One of the bags was partially unzipped.  Through the opening, the officers spied a type of packaging commonly used for cocaine.  An officer removed the package, dropped it onto the nearby fender, and watched as it emitted a puff of white powder.  Further examination disclosed approximately 25 kilograms of cocaine.  At that point, the DEA agents arrested appellant, handcuffed him, and read his Miranda rights once in Spanish and twice in English.  Appellant promptly confessed that he was en route to a rendezvous with drug traffickers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 1992, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Zapata and two codefendants with conspiracy to possess cocaine, intending to distribute the drug, and with the underlying substantive offense.  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1);  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (aiding and abetting).  On March 26, Zapata filed a motion to suppress in which he claimed an illegal search and seizure.  He sought to suppress, inter alia, the cocaine found in the automobile and the statements he had made to law enforcement officers after his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a three-day evidentiary hearing, the court below concluded that, when the officers originally approached appellant, they had a satisfactory basis for reasonable suspicion.  In light of the factual predicate--the informer's tip, the observations made during the surveillance, and the elusive manner in which appellant drove to the rest area--we regard this finding as irreproachable.  See, e.g., United States v. Sokolow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1581</span></a></span>, 1585, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1989) (explaining that \"reasonable suspicion\" sufficient to undergird investigatory stop must be based on \"articulable facts\" drawn from \"the totality of the circumstances\");  United States v. Villanueva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195178\"><a href=\"/opinion/195178/united-states-v-villanueva/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 199 (1st Cir.1994) (similar).  And we note that the officers' suspicions were understandably heightened as events at the rest area unfolded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the nature of the detention, the court pointed out that, in the initial encounter, the police neither restricted appellant's movements nor prevented him from leaving the scene.  At all times, the officers' demeanor was non-coercive;  they spoke courteously, in low, non-threatening tones, and--with the lone exception of Trooper Dockrey's pat on the back--refrained from touching appellant, encircling him, or brandishing their weapons.  The court also determined that appellant fully understood what was happening, and \"seemed eager to cooperate.\"   In sum, the initial detention amounted merely to an investigatory stop, justified by reasonable suspicion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80;  United States v. Streifel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463481\"><a href=\"/opinion/463481/united-states-v-thomas-streifel-and-daniel-j-quinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 957 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking matters a step further, the court ruled that, because appellant voluntarily consented to the car search, no basis existed for suppression of the items taken from the trunk.  The court also ruled appellant's confession to be admissible because he had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in compliance with the Miranda requirements.  Accordingly, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, a jury found appellant guilty on both counts of the indictment.  On March 16, 1993, the district court imposed a ten-year incarcerative sentence.  In this appeal, appellant contests only the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's findings of fact on a motion to suppress are reviewable only for clear error as to consent, see United States v. Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362441\"><a href=\"/opinion/362441/united-states-v-jackie-david-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1130 (1st Cir.1978), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1499</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></span> (1979), probable cause, see United States v. Aguirre, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501807\"><a href=\"/opinion/501807/united-states-v-luis-a-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 857 (1st Cir.1988), and all other factbound matters, see, e.g., United States v. Rutkowski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524958\"><a href=\"/opinion/524958/united-states-v-joseph-rutkowski/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 141 (1st Cir.1989) (reviewing district court's findings as to applicability of \"plain view\" exception under the \"clearly erroneous\" rule).  This deferential standard requires that an appellate court exhibit great respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony, observe the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the deference with which factual findings are to be treated, questions of law remain subject to de novo review.  This phenomenon sets the stage for a more nuanced statement of appellate practice in Fourth Amendment cases.  In scrutinizing a district court's denial of a suppression motion, the court of appeals will review findings of fact for clear error, while at the same time subjecting the trial court's ultimate constitutional conclusions to plenary oversight.  See United States v. Infante-Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195160\"><a href=\"/opinion/195160/united-states-v-infante/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 501 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567586\"><a href=\"/opinion/567586/united-states-v-erwin-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the initial seizure of his person amounted to a de facto arrest;  that he did not voluntarily consent to the subsequent search;  that the contraband found in the car's trunk would not necessarily have been discovered;  and that the illegal practices in which the agents engaged rendered both the fruits of the search and the ensuing confession inadmissible.  We subdivide this multi-layered argument into several components.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. The Initial Encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no scientifically precise formula that enables courts to distinguish between investigatory stops, which can be justified by reasonable suspicion, and other detentions that the law deems sufficiently coercive to require probable cause--detentions that are sometimes called \"de facto arrests.\"   See Florida v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110890\"><a href=\"/opinion/110890/florida-v-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 506, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110890\"><a href=\"/opinion/110890/florida-v-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1329, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110890\"><a href=\"/opinion/110890/florida-v-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span> (1983) (opinion of White, J.);  United States v. Quinn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485654\"><a href=\"/opinion/485654/united-states-v-daniel-j-quinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156 (1st Cir.1987).  The conventional method of classification in respect to such detentions consists of asking whether \"a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation,\" in the circumstances then obtaining, to be tantamount to being under arrest.  Berkemer v. McCarty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3138</span></a></span>, 3151-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span> (1984);  accord Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157.   In suggesting an affirmative answer to this inquiry, appellant highlights two arguably coercive facts:  the presence of five lawmen and the physical touching effected by Trooper Dockrey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court erred in assessing the initial encounter and concluding that a reasonable person, standing in appellant's shoes, would have felt unrestrained.  The encounter occurred in a public place.  Most of the officers were in plain clothes.  Their approach was measured, their words polite, their conduct not bellicose.  They neither voiced threats nor brandished their weapons.  Certainly, the atmosphere at the scene was visibly less coercive than in Quinn, a case in which we overturned the district court's finding that a reasonable person would have thought himself under arrest given the presence of five police officers, a sniffing dog, and a vehicle obstructing egress, see Quinn, 815 F.2d at 155.   Taking into account the full panoply of relevant facts, including the demeanor and deportment of the investigating officers and the tenor of their remarks, we cannot, without more, set aside the trial court's supported finding that the initial encounter did not function as a de facto arrest. Mere numbers do not automatically convert a lawful Terry stop into something more forbidding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the government is not entirely out of the woods.  Appellant, adverting to the slight physical touching, constructs an arresting argument based on certain language contained in California v. Hodari D., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1547</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span> (1991).  In Hodari, a group of youths who were under no suspicion--reasonable or otherwise--panicked and ran when a patrol car passed.  The police pursued.  During the chase, Hodari--one of the fleeing youths--discarded a \"rock\" of crack cocaine.  Soon after, a police officer tackled him.  See id. at 622-23, 111 S.Ct. at 1548-49.   The government charged Hodari with a narcotics offense and offered the cocaine as evidence against him.  The jury found him guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodari challenged the government's right to introduce the evidence.  Its admissibility turned on the question of when the police \"seized\" Hodari--at the moment the chase began or at the time of the tackle.  See id. at 623-24, 111 S.Ct. at 1549-50.   Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, stated that an arrest may transpire in one of two ways:  \"An arrest requires either physical force ... or, where that is absent, submission to the assertion of authority.\"  Id. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1551.   Despite the seeming breadth of this language, it is important to recognize that Hodari focused on the second branch of this disjunctive furcula;  the Court made new law by holding that, absent force, a seizure is not effected until the suspect has submitted.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant attempts to stretch Hodari past the breaking point.  He uses as a lever the Court's statement that \"an arrest is effected by the slightest application of physical force.\"  Id. at 625, 111 S.Ct. at 1550.   Suggesting that this statement be read literally, appellant urges that courts must find an illegal arrest whenever, in the absence of probable cause, the most ephemeral physical contact is made between a police officer and a suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct is not original.  The Seventh Circuit recently rejected a virtually identical argument, holding that, Hodari notwithstanding, a constructive arrest occurs only when the touch first effects a seizure, but not when an investigatory stop (itself a form of seizure) is already in progress at the time of the contact.  See United States v.

We believe that Weaver reaches the correct result and that there is a simple, direct way to reconcile Hodari with cases involving Terry stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hodari, Justice Scalia used the term \"arrest\" in its common law sense.  He understood common law arrest to be coterminous with the modern conception of \"seizure of the person.\"  Hodari, 499 U.S. at 627 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. at 1551 n. 3.   The Court neglected to distinguish between different types of seizures, presumably for two reasons:  the distinction was not directly relevant, and, in any event, the Court's decision rested exclusively on authorities dating from the pre-Terry era--an era when there was perfect congruence between the terms \"arrest\" and \"seizure.\"   See id. at 624-27, 111 S.Ct. at 1549-51.   Properly understood, the passage in Hodari upon which appellant relies merely restates the traditional test for a seizure.  See, e.g., Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16 (\"Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a 'seizure' has occurred.\").  Hodari's solitary innovation is to add the requirement that the suspect submit.  See Hodari, 499 U.S. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glimpsed in this light, Hodari cannot bear the weight that appellant piles upon it.  After all, \"[o]ur Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion.\"  Graham v. Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span> (1989) (emphasis supplied).  Indeed, the concept of an investigatory stop was conceived and nurtured in cases involving protective pat-downs, see Terry, 392 U.S. at 20-30, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-85;  Ballou v. Massachusetts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282444\"><a href=\"/opinion/282444/thomas-j-ballou-jr-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span>, 985 (1st Cir.1968), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span> (1969), and it is by definition impossible to frisk or pat down a suspect without physically touching him.  Then, too, the Court has consistently characterized actions far more corporal than mere touchings as proper investigatory accoutrements, see, e.g., Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585 (upholding investigatory stop although officers grabbed the suspect by the arm and moved him onto the sidewalk);  see also United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111509\"><a href=\"/opinion/111509/united-states-v-montoya-de-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 534, 541, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111509\"><a href=\"/opinion/111509/united-states-v-montoya-de-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span> (1985) (upholding relatively intrusive border search of defendant's person without requiring an antecedent showing of probable cause).  Given both the persuasiveness and the prevalence of these precedents, we join the Seventh Circuit in rejecting the notion that an unheralded dictum in Hodari worked a sea change in the law by imposing a probable cause requirement for all de minimis uses of force, including those incidental to legitimate Terry stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this understanding of Hodari, we cannot say that the lower court erred in concluding that no de facto arrest occurred.  Although an officer did touch appellant, that datum merely establishes that a seizure occurred;  it does not dispose of the question of what sort of seizure took place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  What is decisive in this case is that nothing the officers did, alone or in combination, including the modest laying-on of hands, sufficed to convert the investigatory stop already in progress into an arrest.  See, e.g., United States v. Willis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585860\"><a href=\"/opinion/585860/united-states-v-corey-willis/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1223 (8th Cir.1992) (holding, post-Hodari, that patting down a suspect does not automatically convert a Terry stop into a de facto arrest);  Tom v. Voida, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583406\"><a href=\"/opinion/583406/cheryl-tom-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-wayne-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 958 (7th Cir.1992) (similar;  handcuffing of suspect does not automatically convert Terry stop into de facto arrest).  Since there is no serious doubt that reasonable suspicion existed at the time of the stop--the totality of the circumstances plainly supports the lower court's assessment--the \"seizure\" in this case was lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B. Voluntariness of Consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant asseverates that the district court erred in concluding that he voluntarily consented to the automobile search.  We do not agree.  The court had before it evidence of express consent, along with evidence of consent inferable from conduct.  Appellant freely surrendered the keys to both the doors and the trunk;  and it is settled law that the act of handing over one's car keys, if uncoerced, may in itself support an inference of consent to search the vehicle.  See United States v. Patrone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571449\"><a href=\"/opinion/571449/united-states-v-kenneth-joseph-patrone/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 816 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span> (1992);  see also Miller, 589 F.2d at 1131 (holding to like effect when defendant unlocked his vehicle upon request).  It is equally well settled that a general consent to search a motor vehicle subsumes the specific consent to search any easily accessible containers within the vehicle.  See, e.g., Florida v. Jimeno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112595\"><a href=\"/opinion/112595/florida-v-jimeno/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 251-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112595\"><a href=\"/opinion/112595/florida-v-jimeno/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although appellant harps on the officers' failure to inform him of his right to refuse permission, the rule is that a failure to inform a suspect that he is entitled to withhold his consent to a vehicle search, though relevant to the issue of voluntariness, does not preclude a finding of consent.

What is more, there is a synergistic effect at work here, in that appellant's disclaimer of any ownership interest in the bags strengthens the case for a finding of consent.

At least one court has so ruled under circumstances hauntingly reminiscent of the circumstances at hand.  See People v. Nelson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Misc. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></span>, 983-84 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1985) (holding discovery of evidence inevitable because police had a right to impound, and conduct an inventory search of, an apparently unregistered, uninspected, and uninsured vehicle driven on a public highway).  We discern no valid reason why the same result should not obtain in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>D.

Because the red flag of constitutional infirmity does not fly from these ramparts--the investigatory stop, the search, and the ensuing arrest all pass constitutional muster--and because the requisite Miranda protections were scrupulously observed, the court below appropriately declined to quarantine appellant's confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

We will, therefore, honor his nomenclative preference and refer to him as \"Zapata.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Massachusetts, it is unlawful to operate on a public highway a motor vehicle that is unregistered, see Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 90, Sec. 9 (1986), or one that is uninsured, see id. Sec. 34J</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The court also found that, had the initial seizure risen to the level of an arrest, it would have been illegal because probable cause did not exist at that time.  The government says that this finding is patently erroneous.  We need not reach the question and take no view of it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Of course, the fact of physical contact is relevant to the reasonableness of a suspect's perception that he is under arrest.  See United States v. Perea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600741\"><a href=\"/opinion/600741/united-states-v-ruben-perea/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, 645 (2d Cir.1993).  In this case, the district court, after factoring this information into the calculus, determined that no de facto arrest occurred.  That exercise in factfinding did not constitute clear error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that this principle is totally consistent with the precept that ownership and a subjective expectation of privacy are among the key factors that trigger the right to privacy.  See Aguirre, 839 F.2d at 856-57 (citing other cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> An inventory search is a wholly independent legal procedure serving legitimate governmental ends and circumscribed by standardized rules.   See Colorado v. Bertine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111788\"><a href=\"/opinion/111788/colorado-v-bertine/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 372-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111788\"><a href=\"/opinion/111788/colorado-v-bertine/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span> (1987).  Here, pursuit of that means was ongoing, in the sense that, by the time of the search, the authorities had already secured the critical information concerning the car.  The fact that legal means of discovery are underway at the time an unlawful search transpires is highly relevant to, though not a requisite of, the inevitable discovery inquiry.  See Silvestri, 787 F.2d at 746</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We decline to embrace the suggestion that courts should confine the inevitable discovery rule to cases in which the disputed evidence comprises a derivative, rather than primary, fruit of unlawful police conduct.  See United States v. $639,558 in United States Currency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577094\"><a href=\"/opinion/577094/united-states-v-six-hundred-thirty-nine-thousand-five-hundred-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 718-21 (D.C.Cir.1992).  Although the Nix case involved derivative evidence, we regard its rationale--that the exclusion of inevitably discovered evidence would \"put the government in a worse position\" than if no illegality had occurred, Nix, 467 U.S. at 443, 104 S.Ct. at 2509--to be fully applicable to cases involving primary evidence.  And we are thrice fortified in this conclusion:  by the Nix Court's approving citation to cases that had applied the rule in the context of primary evidence, see id. at 440 n. 2, 104 S.Ct. at 2507 n. 2 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Apker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416957\"><a href=\"/opinion/416957/united-states-v-gary-d-apker-united-states-of-america-v-calvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1983);  United States v. Romero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410451\"><a href=\"/opinion/410451/united-states-v-carlos-richard-romero-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1982);  and United States v.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112136\"><a href=\"/opinion/112136/murray-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 540-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112136\"><a href=\"/opinion/112136/murray-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
