This is  an appeal\n          BOWNES, Senior  Circuit Judge.\n                                       \n\nfrom  the denial  of a  habeas petition  filed by  Juan Ortiz\n\nchallenging   his  Massachusetts   felony-murder  conviction.\n\nAppellant argues that his  right to due process of  law under\n\nthe Fourteenth  Amendment was violated because:  (1) the jury\n\nwas not instructed to  find all of the essential  elements of\n\nfelony-murder    beyond   a   reasonable   doubt;   (2)   the\n\nMassachusetts  Supreme  Judicial  Court  (SJC)  affirmed  his\n\nfelony-murder   conviction  applying   a  legal   theory  not\n\npresented  to  the  jury;  and  (3)  there  was  insufficient\n\nevidence  to support  his felony-murder conviction  under the\n\nCommonwealth's theory  of guilt.   The district  court denied\n\nthe  petition.   We  affirm,  but  for reasons  substantially\n\ndifferent than those expressed by the court below.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          We  commence with  a  recitation of  the  pertinent\n\nfacts.   Appellant's convictions are  based on the  events of\n\nNovember 12, 1985.  That evening,  appellant and his brother,\n\nEduardo \"Crazy Eddie\" Ortiz, left their father's apartment at\n\n8 Stebbins Street in Springfield, Massachusetts to search for\n\nJose  Rodriguez.   Apparently  there was  an ongoing  dispute\n\nbetween Eddie  and various  members of the  Rodriguez family.\n\nIn addition, there was evidence that several members  of that\n\nfamily, one who was believed to be Jose, paid a  visit to the\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nStebbins Street apartment on the day  in question looking for\n\nEddie.  One of the visitors allegedly carried a gun.\n\n          Prior to departing with appellant, Eddie procured a\n\n.357 Magnum and ammunition  from his brother-in-law, which he\n\nplaced in his pants pocket.  There was evidence to the effect\n\nthat appellant agreed to accompany Eddie in order  to provide\n\n\"back up.\"   On the other hand, appellant introduced evidence\n\nthat he  vehemently opposed  his brother's mission,  and went\n\nalong in order to serve as a voice of reason.\n\n          With Eddie  behind the  wheel and appellant  at his\n\nside, the two drove off  in search of their prey.   En route,\n\nEddie pulled over to the curb, removed the gun and ammunition\n\nfrom  his pocket,  loaded  the  gun,  and placed  it  between\n\nhimself  and  his  brother.    After  circling  the  intended\n\nvictim's  block several  times, the  brothers were  unable to\n\nlocate  him, and returned to  their father's apartment.  Upon\n\ntheir arrival in front of 8 Stebbins Street, a police cruiser\n\nmanned by two officers pulled up behind them.  The driver  of\n\nthe cruiser got out  and approached the driver's side  of the\n\nOrtiz vehicle.  As the officer attempted to open the driver's\n\nside door, he was shot  in the face and killed by Eddie.   By\n\nthat time the second officer was trying to pull appellant out\n\nof the  passenger side door.   Eddie shot  and killed  him as\n\nwell.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          There was evidence that, as the officers approached\n\nthe vehicle, both  appellant and his brother reached  for the\n\ngun, but  Eddie got to  it first.   After the  shooting, both\n\nfled  the   scene.     Appellant   was  apprehended   shortly\n\nthereafter.  Eddie committed suicide before he could be taken\n\ninto custody.\n\n          On November  22, 1985  a five count  indictment was\n\nreturned against appellant.  He  was charged with two  counts\n\nof second degree murder,  one for the death of  each officer,\n\nunlawful carrying of a  firearm under his control in  a motor\n\nvehicle, and  attempted assault and battery  with a dangerous\n\nweapon, all felonies.1   The Commonwealth informed  appellant\n\nthat, with  respect to  the  murder indictment,  it would  be\n\nproceeding on a  theory of felony-murder.   It designated the\n\nlatter  two  felonies  as  predicates for  the  felony-murder\n\ncharge.\n\n          Appellant's trial  commenced in January  1987.   At\n\nthe close of the  Commonwealth's case and again at  the close\n\nof  all  the  evidence  appellant  unsuccessfully  moved  for\n\nfindings  of  not  guilty on  all  counts.    The jury  found\n\nappellant guilty  on all  counts.   On attempted  assault and\n\nbattery by means  of a dangerous  weapon, the jury  convicted\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant was also charged with unlawful  possession of\nammunition, a misdemeanor.  Although appellant was ultimately\nconvicted on  this count, by agreement  with the Commonwealth\nhe was never sentenced on it.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nappellant of being a \"joint venturer\" with his brother.  With\n\nregard to the  unlawful carrying charge, the jury  found that\n\nappellant \"jointly possessed\"  the gun with his  brother.  By\n\nspecial verdict, the jury  found the unlawful carrying charge\n\nto be the sole  predicate felony underlying the felony-murder\n\nconvictions.\n\n          Subsequent to the close  of the evidence but before\n\nthe judge instructed the  jury, the Commonwealth informed the\n\ncourt that, in connection  with the unlawful carrying charge,\n\nit would not  be proceeding  on a joint  venture theory,  but\n\nrather  on a basis that appellant \"jointly possessed\" the gun\n\nwith his  brother.  As  a result, the judge  did not instruct\n\nthe  jury  on joint  venture  principles as  to  the unlawful\n\ncarrying charge.2\n\n                    \n\n     2At  a  pre-charge conference  after  the  close of  the\nevidence  and  just  prior   to  the  charge,  the  following\ndiscussion took place:\n               The  Court:    As  I  understand the\n          Commonwealth's  case,  the joint  venture\n          theory applies to the attempted A&amp;B.\n               Commonwealth:  Yes.\n               The Court:  You understand that?\n               Defendant:  I understand that.\n               The Court:  It doesn't apply  to the\n          carrying of  the gun other than  its your\n          contention there is  joint possession  of\n          the gun.\n               Commonwealth:     Right,  and  joint\n          carrying,  in  that   sense,  when   they\n          stopped  the car,  there's only  one gun.\n          He took out the cartridges and loaded the\n          gun.   In essence, at that  stage, we are\n          saying  that both  of them  were carrying\n          the gun.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          After  the jury  rendered  its  verdict,  appellant\n\nrenewed  his motion for findings  of not guilty.   The motion\n\nwas denied in its  entirety, and appellant appealed.   On its\n\nown  initiative, the  SJC removed the  case from  the Appeals\n\nCourt.   The SJC  affirmed the convictions  for felony-murder\n\nand unlawfully carrying a  firearm in a vehicle.   Finding no\n\novert act, however, it  reversed the conviction for attempted\n\nassault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.\n\n          On  direct appeal,  appellant alleged,  inter alia,\n                                                            \n\nthat  the evidence  was insufficient  to support  his felony-\n\nmurder  conviction, and  that the  jury instructions  on this\n\ncharge  were  defective.     The  SJC  rejected   appellant's\n\nsufficiency claim but  indicated that the  jury had not  been\n\ncorrectly instructed.  Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d 698,\n                                            \n\n701-02 (Mass. 1990).  Because appellant had not made a timely\n\nobjection to the jury charge, however, the SJC did not review\n\nthe error for constitutional infirmity, but instead looked to\n\nsee whether the error  created a substantial likelihood of  a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.  Id. at 701.  The court  held that it\n                            \n\ndid not.  Id. at 702.\n             \n\n          Appellant  then  filed a  petition  for  a writ  of\n\nhabeas  corpus in  the United States  District Court  for the\n\n                    \n\n               The Court:  When I talk  about joint\n          enterprise  and  joint  possession, I  am\n          talking  about two  different things.   I\n          will give it to the jury that way.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.  The district court ruled that the\n\njury instructions on felony-murder  were correct and that the\n\nevidence   supporting   this   charge  was   constitutionally\n\nsufficient.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Appellant's first argument is that his right to due\n\nprocess  was  violated  because  the jury  was  not  properly\n\ninstructed   on   the   elements   of   felony-murder   under\n\nMassachusetts law,  and therefore did not  find every element\n\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  See In re Winship,\n                                                            \n\n397 U.S. 358 (1970).   The Commonwealth steadfastly maintains\n\nthat there was no error in the jury instructions.\n\n          On  the charge  of  felony-murder the  trial  court\n\ninstructed the jury as follows: \n\n               The   felony-murder    rule,   where\n          applicable,  is based on  the theory that\n          the  intent  to  commit  the  underlying,\n          independent felony is  equivalent to  the\n          malice   aforethought  necessary   for  a\n          murder conviction.\n               In  order  to  find   the  Defendant\n          guilty of second degree murder  under the\n          felony murder rule, the Commonwealth must\n          prove the following three elements beyond\n          a reasonable doubt.\n               First,  that  there was  an unlawful\n          killing.\n               Second,   that   the  homicide   was\n          committed in  the course  of a felony  or\n          attempted   felony   which   felony   was\n          independent of the homicide.\n               Third, that  under the circumstances\n          of this case  the Defendant committed the\n          felony   or   attempted  felony   with  a\n          conscious disregard for human life.\n\nAlthough  the  judge  elaborated  more fully  on  the  second\n\nelement,   he   incorporated   by  reference   his   previous\n\ndefinitions   of   the  two   possible   predicate  felonies:\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nattempted assault and battery by means  of a dangerous weapon\n\nand unlawful carrying of a firearm in a motor vehicle.3\n\n          On   the  unlawful   carrying   charge  the   judge\n\ninstructed  the jury  that  the prosecution  needed to  prove\n\nthree elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n               First,  that   the  Defendant,  Juan\n          Ortiz, carried a firearm on his person or\n          under his control in a motor vehicle.\n               Second,  that  what  was carried  or\n          that  which  was  under  the  Defendant's\n          control  met  the  definition of  firearm\n          under our law ....\n               And third, that  the Defendant  knew\n          that he was carrying the firearm or  that\n          he had the firearm under his control in a\n          vehicle.\n          ...\n               Carrying  occurs when  the Defendant\n          knowingly   has   more   than   momentary\n          possession  or  control   of  a   working\n          firearm and  moves it from  one place  to\n          another.\n          ...\n               The   control   exercised   by   the\n          Defendant over the area where  the weapon\n          is found need not have been exclusive.  A\n          Defendant  may have  control of  a weapon\n          jointly  with  another  if  he  is  in  a\n          position to exercise dominion  or control\n          over the weapon and that [sic] he intends\n          to do so.\n               With  regard  to   the  element   of\n          control,  the   Commonwealth  must  prove\n          beyond a reasonable doubt that Juan Ortiz\n          knew of the presence and the location  of\n          the  weapon in  the  motor vehicle,  that\n          Juan Ortiz  was in a position  to be able\n          to exercise dominion and control over the\n          weapon   together   with  an   intent  to\n          exercise such dominion and control.\n\n                    \n\n     3The  jury was  also instructed  on the  lesser included\noffense of attempted assault by means of a dangerous weapon.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          The  judge  then  explained  what  the  prosecution\n\nneeded to  prove in  order to convict  appellant of  unlawful\n\ncarrying, with  specific reference to  the evidence presented\n\nat trial:\n\n               [O]ne,  that   the  Defendant,  Juan\n          Ortiz, was a passenger in the  AMC Hornet\n          driven  by  Eduardo   when  they  left  8\n          Stebbins Street and at the time they were\n          apprehended by the two police officers on\n          their return.\n               And,  two, that  the firearm  was in\n          the AMC Hornet and  that Juan Ortiz  knew\n          that it was there.\n               And,  three,  that  Juan  Ortiz  had\n          joint dominion and control of the firearm\n          with  Eduardo  and  intended to  exercise\n          dominion and control.\n\n          Under the felony-murder  rule in Massachusetts, \"`a\n\nhomicide  committed  during   the  commission  or   attempted\n\ncommission of  a felony is  murder.'\"  Commonwealth  v. Pope,\n                                                            \n\n549 N.E.2d  1120, 1123 (Mass. 1990)  (quoting Commonwealth v.\n                                                          \n\nSilva, 447 N.E.2d  646, 652  (Mass. 1983)).   The common  law\n     \n\ndoctrine  of felony-murder  is  one of  constructive  malice,\n\nwhich  allows  the prosecution  to  substitute  the mens  rea\n\nrequired  for  the underlying  felony for  the state  of mind\n\nrequired for murder.

When  a\n\ndefendant  is accused  of personally  killing another  in the\n\ncourse  of committing a felony, then his intent to commit the\n\nunderlying felony may be substituted for the malice necessary\n\nfor a  murder conviction.    If, on  the  other hand,  it  is\n\nunclear  which one  of several  co-felons killed  the victim,\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nthen the Commonwealth  must prove  the existence  of a  joint\n\nventure  to commit the underlying felony in order to obtain a\n\nfelony-murder conviction  against any of the  co-felons.  See\n                                                             \n\nBurrell,  452   N.E.2d  at   505-06.    Similarly,   where  a\n       \n\ndefendant's  co-felon  was the  actual  killer,  in order  to\n\nconvict the defendant of felony-murder, the state is required\n\nto  prove  the existence  of a  joint  venture to  commit the\n\nunderlying felony.    See Ortiz,  560 N.E.2d  at 700  (citing\n                               \n\ncases).\n\n          The  Commonwealth was  required  to prove  beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that appellant intentionally  assisted Eddie\n\nin the commission  of the  felony of unlawful  carrying of  a\n\nfirearm in  a motor  vehicle,  sharing with  his brother  the\n\nmental state required for  that crime.  See Pope,  549 N.E.2d\n                                                \n\nat 1123.  On appellant's direct appeal the SJC held:\n\n               In order to invoke the felony-murder\n          rule in  this case, the  Commonwealth was\n          required to prove in that regard that the\n          defendant  intentionally  encouraged   or\n          assisted Eddie Ortiz in the commission of\n          a felony and that he did so while sharing\n          with   Eddie   Ortiz  the   mental  state\n          required for that crime.\n\nOrtiz, 560 N.E.2d  at 700.   The SJC then  defined the  other\n     \n\nelements necessary to prove felony-murder.\n\n          Appellant maintains that the  failure to include  a\n\njoint  venture instruction  in connection  with the  unlawful\n\ncarrying  charge rendered the  felony-murder instruction with\n\nthe carrying charge as the predicate felony defective because\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nit  did not  render him  responsible for  Eddie's acts.   The\n\nCommonwealth argues, consistent with its  position throughout\n\nappellant's  case, that  \"Massachusetts  state law  does  not\n\nrequire  a  joint venture  instruction  where,  as here,  the\n\npredicate felony is a possessory crime . . . .\"4\n\n          Faced with the SJC's clear statement on the matter,\n\nwe have no choice but to agree with appellant.  The SJC ruled\n\nthat  Ortiz could  not be  found guilty  of felony  murder on\n\nthese facts unless the  Commonwealth proved that Ortiz shared\n\nwith  Eddie  the  mental  state required  for  the  predicate\n\nfelony.  Id.  But joint possession, the only theory presented\n            \n\nby  the Commonwealth,  does  not require  proof of  concerted\n\naction or  shared state of mind,  and thus, does  not offer a\n\nbasis  for  vicarious  liability  for the  criminal  acts  of\n\nothers.   We  find  it incredible  that the  Commonwealth has\n\nsteadfastly  refused to  recognize  the defects  in the  jury\n\ninstruction,  especially  in  light  of  the  SJC's   careful\n\nexplanation of what the  Commonwealth was required to prove.5\n\n                    \n\n     4In  its brief to  the SJC on  appellant's direct appeal\nthe  Commonwealth argued  that, \"joint  enterprise and  joint\npossession may not necessarily  be one and the same,  but, as\nthese theories apply  to the facts of this  case, there is no\ndistinction.\"  Commonwealth's  Brief to the  Supreme Judicial\nCourt at 18.\n\n     5Of course, the  law of  Massachusetts is  what the  SJC\nsays it is.   See Cola v. Reardon, 787 F.2d 681, 688 n.5 (1st\n                                 \nCir.), cert. denied,  479 U.S. 930 (1986); Tarrant  v.

See Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 702.\n                               \n\n          On  direct  appeal, appellant  argued instructional\n\nerror.  But, because he failed to timely object to the charge\n\nas required by the Massachusetts contemporary objection rule,\n\nsee Mass. R. Crim.  P. 24(b), the SJC declined to  review his\n   \n\nclaim on  the  merits  and instead  limited  its  inquiry  to\n\nwhether  the error gave rise to a substantial likelihood of a\n\nmiscarriage  of   justice.    Ortiz,  560  N.E.2d  at  702.  \n                                   \n\nAccordingly, before  we can decide  whether the instructional\n\nerror rises to the level of prejudicial constitutional error,\n\nwe  must   determine,  as   a  preliminary  matter,   whether\n\nappellant's claim is barred  from federal habeas review under\n\nthe procedural default rule of  Wainwright v.

Even assuming cause, however,  our review of\n\nthe record reveals that appellant cannot meet the high burden\n\nof  showing  actual  prejudice.    To   scale  this  wall,  a\n\npetitioner  must demonstrate \"not merely that the errors at .\n\n. . trial created  a possibility of prejudice, but  that they\n\nworked to his actual  and substantial disadvantage, infecting\n\nhis entire  trial with  error of  constitutional dimensions.\"\n\nUnited States v.

Since the SJC affirmed solely on the basis of\nMassachusetts   law,   and   did  not   reach   the   federal\nconstitutional question raised  in appellant's direct appeal,\nit  did  not  waive his  procedural  default.

In order to satisfy the actual innocence\n           \n\nrequirement  and  enable an  otherwise  barred constitutional\n\nclaim to be considered on the merits, a petitioner \"must show\n\nby   clear   and  convincing   evidence   that   but  for   a\n\nconstitutional error,  no reasonable  juror would  have found\n\nthe petitioner [guilty].\"  Sawyer v.

It follows that we would not issue the\n\nwrit on the basis of this error.\n\n          Next, appellant argues  that his writ  should issue\n\nbecause the SJC  affirmed his  conviction on  a legal  theory\n\nthat  was  not  presented  to  the  jury.    More  precisely,\n\nappellant contends that, because  the Commonwealth asked that\n\nthe  jury be  charged as  to joint  possession and  not joint\n\nventure  principles in connection  with the unlawful carrying\n\ncharge,  it necessarily  proceeded  on the  theory that  Juan\n                       \n\nOrtiz personally killed the victims.  According to appellant,\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nit  follows  that   \"the  jury   instructions  required   the\n\ngovernment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Juan Ortiz\n\nwas  personally responsible  for  the acts  that killed  each\n\nvictim.\"7    Therefore,  appellant  concludes  that  the  SJC\n\nassessed  the facts  of his  case against  a legal  theory --\n\njoint venture -- that did not reflect  the theory on which he\n\nwas  tried.   In support  of his  position,  appellant relies\n\nprimarily on Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196 (1948).\n                             \n\n          In Cole, an information charged the defendants with\n                 \n\nviolation  of   2 of an Arkansas criminal statute.  They were\n\nsubsequently  tried and convicted  of   2  violations.  Cole,\n                                                            \n\n333  U.S.  at   198.    The  state   supreme  court  affirmed\n\ndefendants' convictions on the ground that they violated    1\n\nof the same statute, which  describes an offense separate and\n\ndistinct from the offense described in   2.  Id.  The Supreme\n                                                \n\nCourt  found  that the  defendants  \"were  clearly tried  and\n\nconvicted by  the jury  for promoting an  unlawful assemblage\n\nmade an offense by   2, and were not tried for the offense of\n\nusing  force and violence as described in    1.\"  Id. at 199.\n                                                     \n\nThe  Court  added  that,  \"without  completely  ignoring  the\n\njudge's charge, the jury could not have convicted petitioners\n\nfor    having   committed   the   separate,   distinct,   and\n\n                    \n\n     7In effect, on this claim appellant argues that the jury\ninstructions were not defective, but rather, embodied a valid\ntheory  of felony-murder  which did  not  require proof  of a\njoint venture.\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nsubstantially different offense defined in   1.\"  Id. at 200.\n                                                     \n\nWe   have  recognized,  consistent   with  Cole,  that  \"[a]n\n                                               \n\nappellate court  may not lawfully  sustain a conviction  on a\n\ntheory entirely different from the theory upon which the jury\n\nwas  charged.\"  United States  v.

Cole,  333 U.S. at 201.  Further, a\n                              \n\ncriminal defendant also  has the  right to trial  by jury  as\n\nopposed to trial by  an appellate tribunal.  See,  e.g., Dunn\n                                                             \n\nv.

In general, the concerns expressed in Cole are\n                                                         \n\nimplicated  where an  appellate court  in effect  \"charges\" a\n\ndefendant  with a  new  crime, and  then  concludes that  the\n\nevidence  was sufficient  to  support a  conviction for  that\n\npreviously uncharged  offense.

See  Saylor  v.\n                                                         \n\nCornelius,  845 F.2d  1401, 1403-04  (6th Cir.  1988); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Hill, 835 F.2d 759, 764 (10th Cir. 1987).   This is\n              \n\nnot what happened here.\n\n          In  the   first  place,  contrary   to  appellant's\n\ncontention,  the  jury  instructions  did  not  require   the\n                                              \n\nCommonwealth  to prove  that appellant  shot the  officers in\n\norder  to convict him of felony-murder.  Rather, the jury was\n\ninstructed that, although the Commonwealth did not claim that\n                                                  \n\nappellant killed the officers, it  could still convict him of\n\nfelony-murder  if, inter  alia,  he committed  the felony  of\n                              \n\nunlawful carrying  while jointly possessing the  gun with his\n\nbrother.8\n\n          Furthermore,  after  scanning  the record,  we  are\n\nunable  to  see  how  the  concerns  expressed  in  Cole  are\n                                                        \n\nimplicated in this case.  From the outset  of this action the\n\nCommonwealth  and   the  defense  proceeded  on   the  shared\n\n                    \n\n     8In   fact,   appellant  has   acknowledged   that  \"the\ngovernment's  `joint possession'  theory  as a  felony-murder\ntheory  of joint  accountability  is a  fiction  in terms  of\nMassachusetts law.\"   This comports  with the  view that  the\njury  instructions did  not require  the jurors  to determine\nwhether appellant  personally shot the  victims, but  rather,\nwere defective under state law.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nunderstanding that  Eddie killed the officers,  and that Juan\n\ncould  be convicted  of felony-murder  only  on the  basis of\n\nEddie's  actions.    This  is consistent  with  the  bill  of\n\nparticulars, this was  how the case  was presented at  trial,\n\nand this is  how the jury was instructed.  The record clearly\n\ndemonstrates  that  the  Commonwealth sought  to  prove  that\n\nappellant  did not want to  restrain his brother, but rather,\n\nshared  his evil  intentions, and  appellant sought  to prove\n\njust the opposite.  Appellant knew the specific acts that the\n\nCommonwealth endeavored to prove  at trial, he knew precisely\n\nwith what  crime he was charged,  and he knew the  basis upon\n\nwhich  the   alleged  acts  constituted  the  crime  charged.\n\nMoreover,  appellant  is unable  to  point  to any  prejudice\n\nresulting from the SJC's  alleged due process violation, such\n\nas the inability  to prepare a  proper defense.   And, as  we\n\nhave  already held, any  constitutional prejudice  that might\n\nhave  been  engendered  by  the  variance  between  the  jury\n\ninstructions and Massachusetts law cannot be reviewed in this\n\nproceeding.\n\n          This is  an instructional  error case.   This court\n\nhas recognized that\n\n          [i]n   the   traditional  contemporaneous\n          objection situation, the error inheres in\n          the   judge's   charge;   thus,   it   is\n          reasonable  to  require objection  at the\n          time  of   the  error.     In  the   Dunn\n                                                   \n          situation, however, the error  inheres in\n          the appellate court affirmance; thus, the\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\n          error has not yet occurred at the time of\n          the judge's charge.\n\nCola,  787  F.2d at  694.   In  the present  case,  the error\n    \n\ncomplained  of \"inheres in  the judge's charge,\"  and not \"in\n\nthe  appellate court  affirmance.\"   The SJC did  not violate\n\nappellant's due  process rights by recognizing  that the jury\n\nwas improperly  instructed on felony-murder,  and then ruling\n\nthat the evidence adduced at  trial was sufficient to warrant\n\na conviction under Massachusetts  law.  That the Commonwealth\n\nmisunderstood the legal principles underlying its \"theory\" of\n\nguilt,  and  therefore  asked   for  and  received,  with  no\n\nobjection,  a  legally deficient  jury instruction,  does not\n\nplace this case under  the shadow cast  by Cole.  In  effect,\n                                               \n\nappellant asks  us to review his claim of instructional error\n\nthrough the back door.  We decline to do so.\n\n          Appellant's final  argument is  little more than  a\n\nrepetition of his previous argument.  According to appellant,\n\nbecause the  jury instructions necessarily required  proof of\n\nthe fact that  he personally killed the  officers, this court\n\nshould look to whether the evidence was sufficient to support\n\na  conviction  under that  theory.    Because  there  was  no\n\nevidence to that effect, appellant argues that the SJC should\n\nhave  found, and  we must  find, that there  was insufficient\n\nevidence to support his felony-murder conviction.\n\n          For the reasons that we have already explained, the\n\nCommonwealth did  not proceed upon the  theory that appellant\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\npersonally killed the officer,  and the jury instructions did\n\nnot  require proof  of that  fact.   Therefore,  neither this\n\ncourt  nor the SJC is  required to review  the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence against  that theory.   When a  petitioner in  a\n\nhabeas action challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the\n\ncourt's  task  is to  determine  whether  \"after viewing  the\n\nevidence in the  light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational  trier  of  fact  could  have  found  the  essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Jackson v.\n                                                          \n\nVirginia,  443 U.S. 307, 324  (1979).  This  standard must be\n        \n\napplied  \"with  specific reference  to  the  elements of  the\n\noffense as defined by state law.\"  Campbell v. Fair, 838 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1, 4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 847 (1988).   The SJC\n                             \n\ndid just this, and concluded that the evidence was sufficient\n\nto uphold appellant's conviction.  Appellant does not contest\n\nthe accuracy of that ruling.\n\n          Because  one of appellant's  claims is procedurally\n\ndefaulted, and the other  two lack merit, his petition  for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus is denied.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n          Dissent follows.\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n               STAHL,  Circuit Judge, dissenting.  Although I\n                                    \n\nagree  with the majority that a procedural default could have\n\nbeen argued  in this case, and  although I can see  the logic\n\nbehind   raising  such   a   default  sua   sponte  in   many\n                                                  \n\ncircumstances, I find myself  persuaded by Judge Oakes's view\n\nthat  \"the  strength of  petitioner's  case\"  also should  be\n\nconsidered by  courts deciding  whether or  not to raise  the\n\ndefault sua sponte.  See Washington, 996 F.2d at 1454 (Oakes,\n                                   \n\nJ., dissenting).   And, because,  in my view,  a non-harmless\n\nerror undermining the structural guarantee that the jury will\n\nmake  the  requisite  elemental  determinations  clearly  was\n                                                        \n\ncommitted  here, I  would  reach the  merits of  petitioner's\n\nclaim and grant the writ.\n\n               In my  dissenting opinion  in Libby  v. Duval,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 93-1588, slip op. at     (1st Cir. Mar.   , 1994) (Stahl,\n\nJ., dissenting), I explain  in detail why I believe  that the\n\nwhole-record  harmless-error review  prescribed by  Brecht v.\n                                                          \n\nAbrahamson, 113  S. Ct. 1710,  1722 (1993) cannot  and should\n          \n\nnot  be  utilized  by courts  reviewing  instructional errors\n\nwhich  have the effect  of precluding juries  from making the\n\nrequisite factual findings in  criminal trials.9  Instead, as\n\nI  argue in  Libby, habeas courts  reviewing such  errors for\n                  \n\n                    \n\n9.  I therefore regard as misleading the  majority's citation\nto  Brecht while indicating in dictum that it would not grant\n          \nthe writ even  were it  to reach the  merits of  petitioner's\nclaim.  See ante at 17.\n                \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nharmlessness  should employ  the  test set  forth in  Justice\n\nScalia's concurring  opinion  in Carella  v.

Because the error here -- failure to charge\n\nthe  jury that  it must  find a  joint venture  to unlawfully\n\ncarry  a firearm  in a  motor  vehicle in  order  to use  the\n\nunlawful carrying  charge as  a predicate offense  for felony\n\nmurder  --  had exactly  such an  effect,  see id.  at 268-71\n                                                  \n\n(explaining how  instructions  misdescribing (or  failing  to\n\ndescribe) elements  of  crimes and  instructions  setting  up\n\nmandatory presumptions on elements of crimes tend to preclude\n\njuries  from  making   requisite  elemental   determinations)\n\n(Scalia,  J.,  concurring), I  would  review  the error  here\n\naccording to  the dictates of the Carella  concurrence.  That\n                                         \n\nis to  say, I would  ask (1)  whether the omitted  charge was\n\nrelevant  only to an element  of a crime  of which petitioner\n\nwas acquitted;  (2) whether  the omitted charge  was relevant\n\nonly to an element which petitioner admitted;  or (3) whether\n\nno rational jury could  have found what it actually  did find\n                                                             \n\nand  not also  find the  charged element.   See  id.  at 271.\n                                                    \n\nBecause prongs one and two of the Carella test clearly do not\n                                         \n\napply, I will focus on prong three in conducting my analysis.\n\n               While it is clear that the jury did find  both\n\na  joint venture to commit the crime of attempted assault and\n\nbattery  with  a dangerous  weapon  and  that petitioner  was\n\nunlawfully carrying a  firearm in a  motor vehicle (under  an\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\ninstruction  that  required it  to  find  intent to  exercise\n\ndominion and control over the firearm), it seems to me that a\n\nrational  jury,   having  made  these   findings,  would  not\n                                                             \n\nnecessarily also have found that there was a joint venture to\n           \n\ncommit  the crime of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a motor\n\nvehicle.  With regard to the impact of the finding that there\n\nwas a joint  venture to commit attempted assault and battery,\n\nthe  record  reveals  that  petitioner and  his  brother  had\n\nabandoned  the attempted  assault  and battery  prior to  the\n                                                        \n\nkillings.   Thus,  the intent  underlying that  charged crime\n\nmust  necessarily have vanished  prior to the  murders.  (The\n\njury's  special   verdict  form,  which  indicates  that  the\n\nattempted  assault and  battery  felony was  not a  predicate\n                                                \n\noffense for purposes of the felony murder conviction, implies\n\nas much.).   This  means,  of course,  that even  if the  two\n\nintents  were somehow  viewed as  \"functional equivalent[s],\"\n\nsee  id., in nature (and  I do not think that  they can be so\n        \n\nviewed), the  shared intent  underlying the joint  venture to\n\ncommit the  attempted assault  and battery finding  cannot be\n                                                          \n\nthe very same as  the shared intent which would  underlie any\n\n(unmade) finding that there was a joint venture to unlawfully\n\ncarry a firearm.\n\n               The  fact  that,  in  finding  the  petitioner\n\nguilty  of unlawfully  carrying the  firearm, the  jury found\n\nthat  petitioner  \"had  joint  dominion and  control  of  the\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nfirearm with  Eduardo and  intended to exercise  dominion and\n\ncontrol\" presents,  for  me,  a  closer  question.    As  the\n\nmajority opinion  notes (and  as the  SJC observed  on direct\n\nappeal),  the  missing joint  venture  finding encompasses  a\n\ndetermination that petitioner  \"`intentionally encouraged  or\n\nassisted Eddie Ortiz in  the commission of a felony  and that\n\nhe did so  while sharing  with Eddie Ortiz  the mental  state\n\nrequired  for that crime.'\"  Ante at  11 (quoting  Ortiz, 560\n                                                        \n\nN.E.2d at 700.)  In  my view, the jury's \"joint dominion  and\n\ncontrol\" finding is the  functional equivalent of \"the shared\n                   \n\nmental state\" necessary for  a joint venture finding.   It is\n\nnot,  however, the  functional equivalent  of a  finding that\n\npetitioner  \"intentionally encouraged  or assisted\"  Eddie in\n                                                  \n\nthe commission of the unlawful carrying of the weapon.

Appellant argues that his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because:  (1) the jury was not instructed to find all of the essential elements of felony-murder beyond a reasonable doubt;  (2) the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed his felony-murder conviction applying a legal theory not presented to the jury;  and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support his felony-murder conviction under the Commonwealth's theory of guilt.  The district court denied the petition.  We affirm, but for reasons substantially different than those expressed by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commence with a recitation of the pertinent facts.  Appellant's convictions are based on the events of November 12, 1985.  That evening, appellant and his brother, Eduardo \"Crazy Eddie\" Ortiz, left their father's apartment at 8 Stebbins Street in Springfield, Massachusetts to search for Jose Rodriguez.  Apparently there was an ongoing dispute between Eddie and various members of the Rodriguez family.  In addition, there was evidence that several members of that family, one who was believed to be Jose, paid a visit to the Stebbins Street apartment on the day in question looking for Eddie.  One of the visitors allegedly carried a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to departing with appellant, Eddie procured a .357 Magnum and ammunition from his brother-in-law, which he placed in his pants pocket.  There was evidence to the effect that appellant agreed to accompany Eddie in order to provide \"back up.\"   On the other hand, appellant introduced evidence that he vehemently opposed his brother's mission, and went along in order to serve as a voice of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Eddie behind the wheel and appellant at his side, the two drove off in search of their prey.  En route, Eddie pulled over to the curb, removed the gun and ammunition from his pocket, loaded the gun, and placed it between himself and his brother.  After circling the intended victim's block several times, the brothers were unable to locate him, and returned to their father's apartment.  Upon their arrival in front of 8 Stebbins Street, a police cruiser manned by two officers pulled up behind them.  The driver of the cruiser got out and approached the driver's side of the Ortiz vehicle.  As the officer attempted to open the driver's side door, he was shot in the face and killed by Eddie.  By that time the second officer was trying to pull appellant out of the passenger side door.  Eddie shot and killed him as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence that, as the officers approached the vehicle, both appellant and his brother reached for the gun, but Eddie got to it first.  After the shooting, both fled the scene.  Appellant was apprehended shortly thereafter.  Eddie committed suicide before he could be taken into custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1985 a five count indictment was returned against appellant.  He was charged with two counts of second degree murder, one for the death of each officer, unlawful carrying of a firearm under his control in a motor vehicle, and attempted assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, all felonies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Commonwealth informed appellant that, with respect to the murder indictment, it would be proceeding on a theory of felony-murder.  It designated the latter two felonies as predicates for the felony-murder charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's trial commenced in January 1987.  At the close of the Commonwealth's case and again at the close of all the evidence appellant unsuccessfully moved for findings of not guilty on all counts.  The jury found appellant guilty on all counts.  On attempted assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the jury convicted appellant of being a \"joint venturer\" with his brother.  With regard to the unlawful carrying charge, the jury found that appellant \"jointly possessed\" the gun with his brother.  By special verdict, the jury found the unlawful carrying charge to be the sole predicate felony underlying the felony-murder convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to the close of the evidence but before the judge instructed the jury, the Commonwealth informed the court that, in connection with the unlawful carrying charge, it would not be proceeding on a joint venture theory, but rather on a basis that appellant \"jointly possessed\" the gun with his brother.  As a result, the judge did not instruct the jury on joint venture principles as to the unlawful carrying charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury rendered its verdict, appellant renewed his motion for findings of not guilty.  The motion was denied in its entirety, and appellant appealed.  On its own initiative, the SJC removed the case from the Appeals Court.  The SJC affirmed the convictions for felony-murder and unlawfully carrying a firearm in a vehicle.  Finding no overt act, however, it reversed the conviction for attempted assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, appellant alleged, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support his felony-murder conviction, and that the jury instructions on this charge were defective.  The SJC rejected appellant's sufficiency claim but indicated that the jury had not been correctly instructed.  Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 408 Mass. 463, 560 N.E.2d 698, 701-02 (1990).  Because appellant had not made a timely objection to the jury charge, however, the SJC did not review the error for constitutional infirmity, but instead looked to see whether the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Id. at 701.   The court held that it did not.  Id. at 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The district court ruled that the jury instructions on felony-murder were correct and that the evidence supporting this charge was constitutionally sufficient.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first argument is that his right to due process was violated because the jury was not properly instructed on the elements of felony-murder under Massachusetts law, and therefore did not find every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).  The Commonwealth steadfastly maintains that there was no error in the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the charge of felony-murder the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The felony-murder rule, where applicable, is based on the theory that the intent to commit the underlying, independent felony is equivalent to the malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to find the Defendant guilty of second degree murder under the felony murder rule, the Commonwealth must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that there was an unlawful killing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that the homicide was committed in the course of a felony or attempted felony which felony was independent of the homicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that under the circumstances of this case the Defendant committed the felony or attempted felony with a conscious disregard for human life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the judge elaborated more fully on the second element, he incorporated by reference his previous definitions of the two possible predicate felonies:  attempted assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and unlawful carrying of a firearm in a motor vehicle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the unlawful carrying charge the judge instructed the jury that the prosecution needed to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that the Defendant, Juan Ortiz, carried a firearm on his person or under his control in a motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that what was carried or that which was under the Defendant's control met the definition of firearm under our law....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And third, that the Defendant knew that he was carrying the firearm or that he had the firearm under his control in a vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrying occurs when the Defendant knowingly has more than momentary possession or control of a working firearm and moves it from one place to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The control exercised by the Defendant over the area where the weapon is found need not have been exclusive.  A Defendant may have control of a weapon jointly with another if he is in a position to exercise dominion or control over the weapon and that [sic] he intends to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the element of control, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Juan Ortiz knew of the presence and the location of the weapon in the motor vehicle, that Juan Ortiz was in a position to be able to exercise dominion and control over the weapon together with an intent to exercise such dominion and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then explained what the prosecution needed to prove in order to convict appellant of unlawful carrying, with specific reference to the evidence presented at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[O]ne, that the Defendant, Juan Ortiz, was a passenger in the AMC Hornet driven by Eduardo when they left 8 Stebbins Street and at the time they were apprehended by the two police officers on their return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, two, that the firearm was in the AMC Hornet and that Juan Ortiz knew that it was there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, three, that Juan Ortiz had joint dominion and control of the firearm with Eduardo and intended to exercise dominion and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the felony-murder rule in Massachusetts, \" 'a homicide committed during the commission or attempted commission of a felony is murder.' \"  Commonwealth v. Pope, 406 Mass. 581, 549 N.E.2d 1120, 1123 (1990) (quoting Commonwealth v. Silva, 388 Mass. 495, 447 N.E.2d 646, 652 (1983)).  The common law doctrine of felony-murder is one of constructive malice, which allows the prosecution to substitute the mens rea required for the underlying felony for the state of mind required for murder.  See Commonwealth v. Balliro, 349 Mass. 505, 209 N.E.2d 308, 312 (1965).  It thus relieves the prosecution of its burden of proving the essential element of malice aforethought.  Id.  Nonetheless, \" '[n]o person can be held guilty of homicide unless the act is either actually or constructively his, and it cannot be his act in either sense unless committed by his own hand or by someone acting in concert with him or in furtherance of a common object or purpose.' \"  Balliro, 209 N.E.2d at 312 (quoting Commonwealth v. Campbell, 7 Allen 541, 544 (1863)).  \" 'Without such limitation, a person might be held responsible for acts which were not the natural or necessary consequence of the enterprise ... in which he was engaged, and which he could not either in fact or law be deemed to have contemplated or intended.' \"  Commonwealth v. Burrell, 452 N.E.2d 504, 506 (Mass.1983) (quoting Campbell, 7 Allen at 544).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This \"limitation\" gives rise to the joint venture or joint enterprise requirement.  Under Massachusetts law, \"one who aids, commands, counsels, or encourages commission of a crime while sharing with the principal the mental state required for the crime is [a joint venturer and is therefore] guilty as a principal....\"  Burrell, 452 N.E.2d at 505 (quoting Commonwealth v. Soares, 377 Mass. 461, 387 N.E.2d 499, 506, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881, 100 S.Ct. 170, 62 L.Ed.2d 110 (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this case, the joint venture requirement operates in the following manner.  When a defendant is accused of personally killing another in the course of committing a felony, then his intent to commit the underlying felony may be substituted for the malice necessary for a murder conviction.  If, on the other hand, it is unclear which one of several co-felons killed the victim, then the Commonwealth must prove the existence of a joint venture to commit the underlying felony in order to obtain a felony-murder conviction against any of the co-felons.  See Burrell, 452 N.E.2d at 505-06.   Similarly, where a defendant's co-felon was the actual killer, in order to convict the defendant of felony-murder, the state is required to prove the existence of a joint venture to commit the underlying felony.  See Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant intentionally assisted Eddie in the commission of the felony of unlawful carrying of a firearm in a motor vehicle, sharing with his brother the mental state required for that crime.  See Pope, 549 N.E.2d at 1123.   On appellant's direct appeal the SJC held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to invoke the felony-murder rule in this case, the Commonwealth was required to prove in that regard that the defendant intentionally encouraged or assisted Eddie Ortiz in the commission of a felony and that he did so while sharing with Eddie Ortiz the mental state required for that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700.   The SJC then defined the other elements necessary to prove felony-murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant maintains that the failure to include a joint venture instruction in connection with the unlawful carrying charge rendered the felony-murder instruction with the carrying charge as the predicate felony defective because it did not render him responsible for Eddie's acts.  The Commonwealth argues, consistent with its position throughout appellant's case, that \"Massachusetts state law does not require a joint venture instruction where, as here, the predicate felony is a possessory crime....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the SJC's clear statement on the matter, we have no choice but to agree with appellant.  The SJC ruled that Ortiz could not be found guilty of felony murder on these facts unless the Commonwealth proved that Ortiz shared with Eddie the mental state required for the predicate felony.  Id.  But joint possession, the only theory presented by the Commonwealth, does not require proof of concerted action or shared state of mind, and thus, does not offer a basis for vicarious liability for the criminal acts of others.  We find it incredible that the Commonwealth has steadfastly refused to recognize the defects in the jury instruction, especially in light of the SJC's careful explanation of what the Commonwealth was required to prove.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In fact, even the SJC acknowledged that the jury was not properly instructed.  See Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, appellant argued instructional error.  But, because he failed to timely object to the charge as required by the Massachusetts contemporary objection rule, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), the SJC declined to review his claim on the merits and instead limited its inquiry to whether the error gave rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 702.   Accordingly, before we can decide whether the instructional error rises to the level of prejudicial constitutional error, we must determine, as a preliminary matter, whether appellant's claim is barred from federal habeas review under the procedural default rule of Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wainwright held that the failure to timely object at trial to an alleged error as required by a state contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an \"independent and adequate state ground\" sufficient to foreclose federal habeas corpus review of the alleged error.  Id. at 84, 97 S.Ct. at 2505.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In order to escape from the preclusive effect of his procedural default, appellant is obligated to show both \"cause\" for, and \"prejudice\" from, his noncompliance with the Commonwealth's contemporaneous objection rule.  Id. at 86-87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506;  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2644, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986).  After scrutinizing the record, we can find no indication of cause for appellant's failure to comply with Massachusetts' contemporaneous objection rule.  Even assuming cause, however, our review of the record reveals that appellant cannot meet the high burden of showing actual prejudice.  To scale this wall, a petitioner must demonstrate \"not merely that the errors at ... trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\"   United States  v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1596, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a showing of \"cause\" and \"prejudice,\" a procedural default may still be excused where failure to hear the claim would result in a \"fundamental miscarriage of justice.\"  Murray, 477 U.S. at 495-96, 106 S.Ct. at 2649-50.   This exception may be invoked where \"a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent....\"  Id. at 496, 106 S.Ct. at 2649.   In order to satisfy the actual innocence requirement and enable an otherwise barred constitutional claim to be considered on the merits, a petitioner \"must show by clear and convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner [guilty].\"  Sawyer v. Whitley, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2517, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992) (involving petitioner's eligibility for the death penalty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidence presented at trial, we believe that a reasonable jury could have found that appellant engaged in a joint venture with his brother to unlawfully carry a firearm in a motor vehicle.  Therefore, there has been no fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Because of appellant's state procedural default, the trial court's charge cannot be challenged for prejudicial constitutional error in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as appellant points out in its brief, the Commonwealth has not argued procedural default.  Nonetheless, this court has the authority to raise the issue sua sponte.  See Washington v. James, 996 F.2d 1442 (2d Cir.1993) (\"[w]e believe that we may raise the procedural default issue sua sponte\");  Hardiman v. Reynolds, 971 F.2d 500, 502-04 &amp; n. 4 (10th Cir.1992) (district court may raise procedural bar defense sua sponte);  Hull v. Freeman, 932 F.2d 159, 164 &amp; n. 4 (3d Cir.1991) (\"because a state-law procedural default can effect a bar to federal habeas review, we think that it is appropriate for us to consider that issue sua sponte\");  cf. Mansfield v. Champion, 992 F.2d 1098, 1099 n. 2 (10th Cir.1993) (court not required to raise state procedural bar defense sua sponte);  Fagan v.

See Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 83, 97 S.Ct. at 2504;  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 129, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1572, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982).  Because these concerns implicate \"values that transcend the concerns of the parties to an action, ... it is not exclusively within the parties' control to decide whether such a defense should be raised or waived.\"  Hardiman, 971 F.2d at 503.   Where, as is the case here, the state procedural default is clear on the face of the record, it would be a needless expenditure of scarce judicial resources were we to address the merits of appellant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we reached the merits of this claim, we believe that the government has met its burden of demonstrating that the error did not \" 'have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1714, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).  It follows that we would not issue the writ on the basis of this error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant argues that his writ should issue because the SJC affirmed his conviction on a legal theory that was not presented to the jury.  More precisely, appellant contends that, because the Commonwealth asked that the jury be charged as to joint possession and not joint venture principles in connection with the unlawful carrying charge, it necessarily proceeded on the theory that Juan Ortiz personally killed the victims.  According to appellant, it follows that \"the jury instructions required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Juan Ortiz was personally responsible for the acts that killed each victim.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Therefore, appellant concludes that the SJC assessed the facts of his case against a legal theory--joint venture--that did not reflect the theory on which he was tried.  In support of his position, appellant relies primarily on Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cole, an information charged the defendants with violation of Sec. 2 of an Arkansas criminal statute.  They were subsequently tried and convicted of Sec. 2 violations.  Cole, 333 U.S. at 198, 68 S.Ct. at 515.   The state supreme court affirmed defendants' convictions on the ground that they violated Sec. 1 of the same statute, which describes an offense separate and distinct from the offense described in Sec. 2.  Id.  The Supreme Court found that the defendants \"were clearly tried and convicted by the jury for promoting an unlawful assemblage made an offense by Sec. 2, and were not tried for the offense of using force and violence as described in Sec. 1.\"  Id. at 199, 68 S.Ct. at 516.   The Court added that, \"without completely ignoring the judge's charge, the jury could not have convicted petitioners for having committed the separate, distinct, and substantially different offense defined in Sec. 1.\"  Id. at 200, 68 S.Ct. at 516.   We have recognized, consistent with Cole, that \"[a]n appellate court may not lawfully sustain a conviction on a theory entirely different from the theory upon which the jury was charged.\"  United States v. Gomes, 969 F.2d 1290, 1295 (1st Cir.1992);  see United States v. Anguilo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1197 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845, 111 S.Ct. 130, 112 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court may not go outside of the prosecution's trial theory to affirm a conviction because a criminal defendant must have notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to be heard in a trial on the issues raised by those charges.  Cole, 333 U.S. at 201, 68 S.Ct. at 517.   Further, a criminal defendant also has the right to trial by jury as opposed to trial by an appellate tribunal.  See, e.g., Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979) (appeals court affirmed conviction based upon specific acts, the alleged criminality of which the defendant was never afforded notice);  Cola v. Reardon, 787 F.2d 681 (1st Cir.)  (same), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 930, 107 S.Ct. 398, 93 L.Ed.2d 351 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to appellant, Cole is controlling here.  We disagree.  In general, the concerns expressed in Cole are implicated where an appellate court in effect \"charges\" a defendant with a new crime, and then concludes that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for that previously uncharged offense.  Thus, if the prosecution decides to submit a case to the jury on one of two equally valid legal theories, and the jury convicts despite insufficient evidence, on appeal the court cannot resurrect the conviction by ruling that there was sufficient evidence to convict on the alternative theory.  See Saylor v. Cornelius, 845 F.2d 1401, 1403-04 (6th Cir.1988);   United States v. Hill, 835 F.2d 759, 764 (10th Cir.1987).  This is not what happened here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, contrary to appellant's contention, the jury instructions did not require the Commonwealth to prove that appellant shot the officers in order to convict him of felony-murder.  Rather, the jury was instructed that, although the Commonwealth did not claim that appellant killed the officers, it could still convict him of felony-murder if, inter alia, he committed the felony of unlawful carrying while jointly possessing the gun with his brother.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, after scanning the record, we are unable to see how the concerns expressed in Cole are implicated in this case.  From the outset of this action the Commonwealth and the defense proceeded on the shared understanding that Eddie killed the officers, and that Juan could be convicted of felony-murder only on the basis of Eddie's actions.  This is consistent with the bill of particulars, this was how the case was presented at trial, and this is how the jury was instructed.  The record clearly demonstrates that the Commonwealth sought to prove that appellant did not want to restrain his brother, but rather, shared his evil intentions, and appellant sought to prove just the opposite.  Appellant knew the specific acts that the Commonwealth endeavored to prove at trial, he knew precisely with what crime he was charged, and he knew the basis upon which the alleged acts constituted the crime charged.  Moreover, appellant is unable to point to any prejudice resulting from the SJC's alleged due process violation, such as the inability to prepare a proper defense.  And, as we have already held, any constitutional prejudice that might have been engendered by the variance between the jury instructions and Massachusetts law cannot be reviewed in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an instructional error case.  This court has recognized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>[i]n the traditional contemporaneous objection situation, the error inheres in the judge's charge;  thus, it is reasonable to require objection at the time of the error.  In the Dunn situation, however, the error inheres in the appellate court affirmance;  thus, the error has not yet occurred at the time of the judge's charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cola, 787 F.2d at 694.   In the present case, the error complained of \"inheres in the judge's charge,\" and not \"in the appellate court affirmance.\"   The SJC did not violate appellant's due process rights by recognizing that the jury was improperly instructed on felony-murder, and then ruling that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to warrant a conviction under Massachusetts law.  That the Commonwealth misunderstood the legal principles underlying its \"theory\" of guilt, and therefore asked for and received, with no objection, a legally deficient jury instruction, does not place this case under the shadow cast by Cole.   In effect, appellant asks us to review his claim of instructional error through the back door.  We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final argument is little more than a repetition of his previous argument.  According to appellant, because the jury instructions necessarily required proof of the fact that he personally killed the officers, this court should look to whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under that theory.  Because there was no evidence to that effect, appellant argues that the SJC should have found, and we must find, that there was insufficient evidence to support his felony-murder conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that we have already explained, the Commonwealth did not proceed upon the theory that appellant personally killed the officer, and the jury instructions did not require proof of that fact.  Therefore, neither this court nor the SJC is required to review the sufficiency of the evidence against that theory.  When a petitioner in a habeas action challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the court's task is to determine whether \"after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 334, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2797, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).  This standard must be applied \"with specific reference to the elements of the offense as defined by state law.\"   Campbell v. Fair, 838 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 847, 109 S.Ct. 126, 102 L.Ed.2d 100 (1988).  The SJC did just this, and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to uphold appellant's conviction.  Appellant does not contest the accuracy of that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because one of appellant's claims is procedurally defaulted, and the other two lack merit, his petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I agree with the majority that a procedural default could have been argued in this case, and although I can see the logic behind raising such a default sua sponte in many circumstances, I find myself persuaded by Judge Oakes's view that \"the strength of petitioner's case\" also should be considered by courts deciding whether or not to raise the default sua sponte.  See Washington, 996 F.2d at 1454 (Oakes, J., dissenting).  And, because, in my view, a non-harmless error undermining the structural guarantee that the jury will make the requisite elemental determinations clearly was committed here, I would reach the merits of petitioner's claim and grant the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my dissenting opinion in Libby v. Duval, 19 F.3d 733, 742 (1st Cir.1994) (Stahl, J., dissenting), I explain in detail why I believe that the whole-record harmless-error review prescribed by Brecht v. Abrahamson, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) cannot and should not be utilized by courts reviewing instructional errors which have the effect of precluding juries from making the requisite factual findings in criminal trials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Instead, as I argue in Libby, habeas courts reviewing such errors for harmlessness should employ the test set forth in Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989).  Because the error here--failure to charge the jury that it must find a joint venture to unlawfully carry a firearm in a motor vehicle in order to use the unlawful carrying charge as a predicate offense for felony murder--had exactly such an effect, see id. at 268-71, 109 S.Ct. at 2422-23 (explaining how instructions misdescribing (or failing to describe) elements of crimes and instructions setting up mandatory presumptions on elements of crimes tend to preclude juries from making requisite elemental determinations) (Scalia, J., concurring), I would review the error here according to the dictates of the Carella concurrence.  That is to say, I would ask (1) whether the omitted charge was relevant only to an element of a crime of which petitioner was acquitted;  (2) whether the omitted charge was relevant only to an element which petitioner admitted;  or (3) whether no rational jury could have found what it actually did find and not also find the charged element.  See id. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423.   Because prongs one and two of the Carella test clearly do not apply, I will focus on prong three in conducting my analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is clear that the jury did find both a joint venture to commit the crime of attempted assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and that petitioner was unlawfully carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle (under an instruction that required it to find intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm), it seems to me that a rational jury, having made these findings, would not necessarily also have found that there was a joint venture to commit the crime of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle.  With regard to the impact of the finding that there was a joint venture to commit attempted assault and battery, the record reveals that petitioner and his brother had abandoned the attempted assault and battery prior to the killings.  Thus, the intent underlying that charged crime must necessarily have vanished prior to the murders.  (The jury's special verdict form, which indicates that the attempted assault and battery felony was not a predicate offense for purposes of the felony murder conviction, implies as much.).  This means, of course, that even if the two intents were somehow viewed as \"functional equivalent[s],\" see id., in nature (and I do not think that they can be so viewed), the shared intent underlying the joint venture to commit the attempted assault and battery finding cannot be the very same as the shared intent which would underlie any (unmade) finding that there was a joint venture to unlawfully carry a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that, in finding the petitioner guilty of unlawfully carrying the firearm, the jury found that petitioner \"had joint dominion and control of the firearm with Eduardo and intended to exercise dominion and control\" presents, for me, a closer question.  As the majority opinion notes (and as the SJC observed on direct appeal), the missing joint venture finding encompasses a determination that petitioner \" 'intentionally encouraged or assisted Eddie Ortiz in the commission of a felony and that he did so while sharing with Eddie Ortiz the mental state required for that crime.' \"   Ante at 713 (quoting Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700.)   In my view, the jury's \"joint dominion and control\" finding is the functional equivalent of \"the shared mental state\" necessary for a joint venture finding.  It is not, however, the functional equivalent of a finding that petitioner \"intentionally encouraged or assisted\" Eddie in the commission of the unlawful carrying of the weapon.  Thus, the record is devoid of factual findings which are \" 'so closely related to the ultimate fact [to be found] that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding th[e] ultimate fact.' \"  Id.  Accordingly, the error here was not harmless.

Appellant argues that his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because:  (1) the jury was not instructed to find all of the essential elements of felony-murder beyond a reasonable doubt;  (2) the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed his felony-murder conviction applying a legal theory not presented to the jury;  and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support his felony-murder conviction under the Commonwealth's theory of guilt.  The district court denied the petition.  We affirm, but for reasons substantially different than those expressed by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commence with a recitation of the pertinent facts.  Appellant's convictions are based on the events of November 12, 1985.  That evening, appellant and his brother, Eduardo \"Crazy Eddie\" Ortiz, left their father's apartment at 8 Stebbins Street in Springfield, Massachusetts to search for Jose Rodriguez.  Apparently there was an ongoing dispute between Eddie and various members of the Rodriguez family.  In addition, there was evidence that several members of that family, one who was believed to be Jose, paid a visit to the Stebbins Street apartment on the day in question looking for Eddie.  One of the visitors allegedly carried a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to departing with appellant, Eddie procured a .357 Magnum and ammunition from his brother-in-law, which he placed in his pants pocket.  There was evidence to the effect that appellant agreed to accompany Eddie in order to provide \"back up.\"   On the other hand, appellant introduced evidence that he vehemently opposed his brother's mission, and went along in order to serve as a voice of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Eddie behind the wheel and appellant at his side, the two drove off in search of their prey.  En route, Eddie pulled over to the curb, removed the gun and ammunition from his pocket, loaded the gun, and placed it between himself and his brother.  After circling the intended victim's block several times, the brothers were unable to locate him, and returned to their father's apartment.  Upon their arrival in front of 8 Stebbins Street, a police cruiser manned by two officers pulled up behind them.  The driver of the cruiser got out and approached the driver's side of the Ortiz vehicle.  As the officer attempted to open the driver's side door, he was shot in the face and killed by Eddie.  By that time the second officer was trying to pull appellant out of the passenger side door.

After the shooting, both fled the scene.  Appellant was apprehended shortly thereafter.  Eddie committed suicide before he could be taken into custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1985 a five count indictment was returned against appellant.  He was charged with two counts of second degree murder, one for the death of each officer, unlawful carrying of a firearm under his control in a motor vehicle, and attempted assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, all felonies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Commonwealth informed appellant that, with respect to the murder indictment, it would be proceeding on a theory of felony-murder.  It designated the latter two felonies as predicates for the felony-murder charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's trial commenced in January 1987.  At the close of the Commonwealth's case and again at the close of all the evidence appellant unsuccessfully moved for findings of not guilty on all counts.  The jury found appellant guilty on all counts.  On attempted assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the jury convicted appellant of being a \"joint venturer\" with his brother.  With regard to the unlawful carrying charge, the jury found that appellant \"jointly possessed\" the gun with his brother.  By special verdict, the jury found the unlawful carrying charge to be the sole predicate felony underlying the felony-murder convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to the close of the evidence but before the judge instructed the jury, the Commonwealth informed the court that, in connection with the unlawful carrying charge, it would not be proceeding on a joint venture theory, but rather on a basis that appellant \"jointly possessed\" the gun with his brother.  As a result, the judge did not instruct the jury on joint venture principles as to the unlawful carrying charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury rendered its verdict, appellant renewed his motion for findings of not guilty.  The motion was denied in its entirety, and appellant appealed.  On its own initiative, the SJC removed the case from the Appeals Court.  The SJC affirmed the convictions for felony-murder and unlawfully carrying a firearm in a vehicle.  Finding no overt act, however, it reversed the conviction for attempted assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, appellant alleged, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support his felony-murder conviction, and that the jury instructions on this charge were defective.  The SJC rejected appellant's sufficiency claim but indicated that the jury had not been correctly instructed.  Commonwealth v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120900\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120900/commonwealth-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120900\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120900/commonwealth-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701-02 (1990).  Because appellant had not made a timely objection to the jury charge, however, the SJC did not review the error for constitutional infirmity, but instead looked to see whether the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Id. at 701.   The court held that it did not.

The common law doctrine of felony-murder is one of constructive malice, which allows the prosecution to substitute the mens rea required for the underlying felony for the state of mind required for murder.

When a defendant is accused of personally killing another in the course of committing a felony, then his intent to commit the underlying felony may be substituted for the malice necessary for a murder conviction.  If, on the other hand, it is unclear which one of several co-felons killed the victim, then the Commonwealth must prove the existence of a joint venture to commit the underlying felony in order to obtain a felony-murder conviction against any of the co-felons.  See Burrell, 452 N.E.2d at 505-06.   Similarly, where a defendant's co-felon was the actual killer, in order to convict the defendant of felony-murder, the state is required to prove the existence of a joint venture to commit the underlying felony.  See Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant intentionally assisted Eddie in the commission of the felony of unlawful carrying of a firearm in a motor vehicle, sharing with his brother the mental state required for that crime.  See Pope, 549 N.E.2d at 1123.   On appellant's direct appeal the SJC held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to invoke the felony-murder rule in this case, the Commonwealth was required to prove in that regard that the defendant intentionally encouraged or assisted Eddie Ortiz in the commission of a felony and that he did so while sharing with Eddie Ortiz the mental state required for that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700.

The Commonwealth argues, consistent with its position throughout appellant's case, that \"Massachusetts state law does not require a joint venture instruction where, as here, the predicate felony is a possessory crime....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the SJC's clear statement on the matter, we have no choice but to agree with appellant.  The SJC ruled that Ortiz could not be found guilty of felony murder on these facts unless the Commonwealth proved that Ortiz shared with Eddie the mental state required for the predicate felony.  Id.  But joint possession, the only theory presented by the Commonwealth, does not require proof of concerted action or shared state of mind, and thus, does not offer a basis for vicarious liability for the criminal acts of others.  We find it incredible that the Commonwealth has steadfastly refused to recognize the defects in the jury instruction, especially in light of the SJC's careful explanation of what the Commonwealth was required to prove.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In fact, even the SJC acknowledged that the jury was not properly instructed.

But, because he failed to timely object to the charge as required by the Massachusetts contemporary objection rule, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), the SJC declined to review his claim on the merits and instead limited its inquiry to whether the error gave rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 702.

According to appellant, it follows that \"the jury instructions required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Juan Ortiz was personally responsible for the acts that killed each victim.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Therefore, appellant concludes that the SJC assessed the facts of his case against a legal theory--joint venture--that did not reflect the theory on which he was tried.

We disagree.  In general, the concerns expressed in Cole are implicated where an appellate court in effect \"charges\" a defendant with a new crime, and then concludes that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for that previously uncharged offense.  Thus, if the prosecution decides to submit a case to the jury on one of two equally valid legal theories, and the jury convicts despite insufficient evidence, on appeal the court cannot resurrect the conviction by ruling that there was sufficient evidence to convict on the alternative theory.  See Saylor v. Cornelius, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505533\"><a href=\"/opinion/505533/lloyd-virgil-saylor-v-clarence-cornelius-judge-harlan-county-circuit/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1401</span></a></span>, 1403-04 (6th Cir.1988);   United States v.

This is not what happened here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, contrary to appellant's contention, the jury instructions did not require the Commonwealth to prove that appellant shot the officers in order to convict him of felony-murder.  Rather, the jury was instructed that, although the Commonwealth did not claim that appellant killed the officers, it could still convict him of felony-murder if, inter alia, he committed the felony of unlawful carrying while jointly possessing the gun with his brother.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, after scanning the record, we are unable to see how the concerns expressed in Cole are implicated in this case.  From the outset of this action the Commonwealth and the defense proceeded on the shared understanding that Eddie killed the officers, and that Juan could be convicted of felony-murder only on the basis of Eddie's actions.  This is consistent with the bill of particulars, this was how the case was presented at trial, and this is how the jury was instructed.  The record clearly demonstrates that the Commonwealth sought to prove that appellant did not want to restrain his brother, but rather, shared his evil intentions, and appellant sought to prove just the opposite.  Appellant knew the specific acts that the Commonwealth endeavored to prove at trial, he knew precisely with what crime he was charged, and he knew the basis upon which the alleged acts constituted the crime charged.  Moreover, appellant is unable to point to any prejudice resulting from the SJC's alleged due process violation, such as the inability to prepare a proper defense.  And, as we have already held, any constitutional prejudice that might have been engendered by the variance between the jury instructions and Massachusetts law cannot be reviewed in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an instructional error case.  This court has recognized that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>[i]n the traditional contemporaneous objection situation, the error inheres in the judge's charge;  thus, it is reasonable to require objection at the time of the error.  In the Dunn situation, however, the error inheres in the appellate court affirmance;  thus, the error has not yet occurred at the time of the judge's charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cola, 787 F.2d at 694.   In the present case, the error complained of \"inheres in the judge's charge,\" and not \"in the appellate court affirmance.\"   The SJC did not violate appellant's due process rights by recognizing that the jury was improperly instructed on felony-murder, and then ruling that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to warrant a conviction under Massachusetts law.  That the Commonwealth misunderstood the legal principles underlying its \"theory\" of guilt, and therefore asked for and received, with no objection, a legally deficient jury instruction, does not place this case under the shadow cast by Cole.   In effect, appellant asks us to review his claim of instructional error through the back door.  We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final argument is little more than a repetition of his previous argument.  According to appellant, because the jury instructions necessarily required proof of the fact that he personally killed the officers, this court should look to whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under that theory.  Because there was no evidence to that effect, appellant argues that the SJC should have found, and we must find, that there was insufficient evidence to support his felony-murder conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that we have already explained, the Commonwealth did not proceed upon the theory that appellant personally killed the officer, and the jury instructions did not require proof of that fact.  Therefore, neither this court nor the SJC is required to review the sufficiency of the evidence against that theory.  When a petitioner in a habeas action challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the court's task is to determine whether \"after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"   Jackson v.

Because the error here--failure to charge the jury that it must find a joint venture to unlawfully carry a firearm in a motor vehicle in order to use the unlawful carrying charge as a predicate offense for felony murder--had exactly such an effect, see id. at 268-71, 109 S.Ct. at 2422-23 (explaining how instructions misdescribing (or failing to describe) elements of crimes and instructions setting up mandatory presumptions on elements of crimes tend to preclude juries from making requisite elemental determinations) (Scalia, J., concurring), I would review the error here according to the dictates of the Carella concurrence.  That is to say, I would ask (1) whether the omitted charge was relevant only to an element of a crime of which petitioner was acquitted;  (2) whether the omitted charge was relevant only to an element which petitioner admitted;  or (3) whether no rational jury could have found what it actually did find and not also find the charged element.  See id. at 271, 109 S.Ct. at 2423.   Because prongs one and two of the Carella test clearly do not apply, I will focus on prong three in conducting my analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is clear that the jury did find both a joint venture to commit the crime of attempted assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and that petitioner was unlawfully carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle (under an instruction that required it to find intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm), it seems to me that a rational jury, having made these findings, would not necessarily also have found that there was a joint venture to commit the crime of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle.  With regard to the impact of the finding that there was a joint venture to commit attempted assault and battery, the record reveals that petitioner and his brother had abandoned the attempted assault and battery prior to the killings.  Thus, the intent underlying that charged crime must necessarily have vanished prior to the murders.  (The jury's special verdict form, which indicates that the attempted assault and battery felony was not a predicate offense for purposes of the felony murder conviction, implies as much.).  This means, of course, that even if the two intents were somehow viewed as \"functional equivalent[s],\" see id., in nature (and I do not think that they can be so viewed), the shared intent underlying the joint venture to commit the attempted assault and battery finding cannot be the very same as the shared intent which would underlie any (unmade) finding that there was a joint venture to unlawfully carry a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that, in finding the petitioner guilty of unlawfully carrying the firearm, the jury found that petitioner \"had joint dominion and control of the firearm with Eduardo and intended to exercise dominion and control\" presents, for me, a closer question.  As the majority opinion notes (and as the SJC observed on direct appeal), the missing joint venture finding encompasses a determination that petitioner \" 'intentionally encouraged or assisted Eddie Ortiz in the commission of a felony and that he did so while sharing with Eddie Ortiz the mental state required for that crime.' \"   Ante at 713 (quoting Ortiz, 560 N.E.2d at 700.)   In my view, the jury's \"joint dominion and control\" finding is the functional equivalent of \"the shared mental state\" necessary for a joint venture finding.  It is not, however, the functional equivalent of a finding that petitioner \"intentionally encouraged or assisted\" Eddie in the commission of the unlawful carrying of the weapon.  Thus, the record is devoid of factual findings which are \" 'so closely related to the ultimate fact [to be found] that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding th[e] ultimate fact.' \"  Id.  Accordingly, the error here was not harmless.
