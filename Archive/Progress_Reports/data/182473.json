The remaining footnotes should be renumbered\naccordingly.\n\n     There may be a concern that Section 556, to the extent it\n\fmight be read to allow, contrary to Rule 56, a judge to\nresolve a disputed material issue of fact, would then\npreclude a party from exercising its Seventh Amendment\nrights to trial by jury on disputed issues of material\nfact. Cf. Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Eng'g Co., 243 U.S.\n273, 278 (1917) (summary judgment does not violate\nSeventh Amendment).    But Section 556 is a relatively\nyoung statute, not much construed by the state courts,\nand there is no reason to think the state courts would\nconstrue Section 556 so as to be incompatible with the\nSeventh Amendment. Although the Seventh Amendment has\nnot been incorporated against the states, Curtis v.\nLoether, 415 U.S. 189, 192 n.6 (1974), Maine's\nconstitution itself provides that \"[i]n all civil suits,\nand in all controversies concerning property, the parties\nshall have a right to a trial by jury, except in cases\nwhere it has heretofore been otherwise practiced.\" Me.\nConst. art. I, ยง 20. This provision has \"historically\nbeen construed as guaranteeing the right to a trial by\njury in civil cases unless it is demonstrated that such\na right did not exist at the time of the adoption of\n[Maine's] Constitution.\" Smith v. Hawthorne, 892 A.2d\n433, 444 (Me. 2006).     We do note that the heightened\npleading standard under the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act (PSLRA) does not violate the Seventh\nAmendment. See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,\nLtd., 551 U.S. 308, 327 & n.8 (2007).\n\f",
