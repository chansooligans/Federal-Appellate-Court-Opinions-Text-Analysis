Appellant  Nancy\n                                         \n\nEsperanza Matiz  was tried  to a jury  and convicted  in the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court  for   the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts  for  conspiracy  to possess  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute five or  more kilograms of cocaine,  in violation\n\nof  21 U.S.C.      841(a)(1)  and 846.    Matiz appeals  her\n\nconviction and  argues that:   (1)  the evidence  introduced\n\nagainst her was  insufficient to support the  guilty verdict\n\nreturned by the jury, (2) her  conviction should be reversed\n\non the grounds that the Government's conduct was outrageous,\n\nand (3) the  district court erred in  enhancing her sentence\n\nfor obstruction of justice pursuant to   3C1.1 of the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines.  We affirm.1     \n\n                             I.\n\n          This case arose out of a large scale investigation\n\nconducted by  various  government  agencies  in  the  United\n\nStates  and  Colombia,  South   America  into  the   cocaine\n\ndistribution activities  of a  number of  individuals.   The\n\nUnited States Government (the Government) had the assistance\n\nof Pedro Alvarez, a defendant in another criminal matter.\n\n                    \n\n1The district  court possessed  subject matter  jurisdiction\npursuant to 18  U.S.C.   3231.  This  court has jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1291 and 18 U.S.C.   3742 (a)(2).\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          Alvarez, at the behest of the Government, posed as\n\na purchaser and  contacted a number of  cocaine suppliers in\n\nColombia.      Negotiations  ensued   over   several  months\n\npertaining to the  purchase of large quantities  of cocaine.\n\nIn  the  early  part  of  1991,  the  suppliers in  Colombia\n\ninformed  Alvarez  that  they  were  experiencing  temporary\n\ndifficulties  in  smuggling  the  cocaine  into  the  United\n\nStates.   In light of these difficulties, they asked Alvarez\n\nto  assist them in transporting the shipment.  Additionally,\n\nthe  suppliers asked  Alvarez to  store  and distribute  the\n\ncocaine to their associates.\n\n          The Government told Alvarez to request an up-front\n\npayment   of   $30,000  for   his  troubles   and  expenses.\n\nReluctantly, the suppliers agreed and informed  Alvarez that\n\nthe payment  would be made  by one of  their New  York based\n\nassociates,  \"La  Negra,\"  a  code  name  for  Matiz.    The\n\nsuppliers gave Alvarez  \"La Negra's\" beeper number  and code\n\nphrase for communication with her.\n\n          Alvarez and  Matiz ultimately scheduled  a meeting\n\nfor May  23, 1991, for  Matiz to hand  over the money  to an\n\nassociate of Alvarez, actually Special Agent Dominick Lopez,\n\nat a Burger  King restaurant  in Queens, New  York.  At  the\n\nscheduled hour, Matiz,  along with an associate  named Diaz,\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ndrove to  the meeting place  in a Nissan Pathfinder.   After\n\nLopez entered the vehicle, Matiz  instructed Diaz to get the\n\nmoney.  Diaz retrieved the money  from under the seat of the\n\nautomobile and passed it to Matiz who then gave it to Lopez.\n\nThe  sum,  however,  amounted  to  only  $20,000  and  Matiz\n\npromised to make  an additional payment  of $5,000 the  next\n\nday, explaining that  she had been told that  the amount due\n\nwas $25,000.\n\n          After  this  exchange,  Matiz  remained  in  close\n\ncontact with  Alvarez.    She  informed  him  that  she  was\n\npersonally  expecting  to  receive a  large  portion  of the\n\ncocaine  shipment  upon  its  arrival.    The  suppliers  in\n\nColombia  confirmed this  information both  in conversations\n\nwith Alvarez and in facsimile messages sent to him.  T  h  e\n\nshipment  consisting of  615  kilograms of  cocaine  finally\n\narrived in the  United States on June  4, 1991.  On  June 5,\n\n1991,  the suppliers  sent Alvarez  written  instructions by\n\nfacsimile from  Colombia regarding  the distribution  of the\n\ncocaine.   The  instructions  directed  that, among  others,\n\nMatiz should receive 51 1/2 kilograms of the cocaine.   \n\n          Alvarez telephoned Matiz on  numerous occasions to\n\ndiscuss  the details  of the  pickup of  her portion  of the\n\ncocaine.   During  these conversations, Matiz  expressed her\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\ndesire  to obtain  her portion  of  the cocaine  as soon  as\n\npossible.    Initially,  she  also  voiced  an  interest  in\n\npurchasing some of the cocaine that Alvarez had received  as\n\nhis  fee for transporting the cocaine.  Ultimately, however,\n\nshe decided against it because of financial constraints.\n\n          Finally, Alvarez informed Matiz that  she would be\n\nable to pick up her portion of the cocaine on June 12, 1991.\n\nHe   reserved  a  hotel   room  for  Matiz   in  Middleboro,\n\nMassachusetts near the site for the transfer of the cocaine.\n\nMatiz  and Diaz  arrived at  the  hotel on  June 10.    In a\n\ncontinued effort  to conceal their identities,  they checked\n\ninto the hotel using fictitious names and addresses.  \n\n          The following  evening, Alvarez and  Special Agent\n\nDillon   met  Matiz  at  the  hotel   to  review  the  final\n\narrangements  for  the   pickup.      A  number  of  Matiz's\n\nassistants, who  had arrived at the hotel on the same day as\n\nMatiz, were designated to collect the cocaine.  Also, during\n\nthis  meeting, Agent Dillon  gave Matiz a  facsimile message\n\nfrom the suppliers that they sent to Alvarez instructing her\n\nto deposit  the purchase  price for  the cocaine  in various\n\naccounts  in branches  of the Chase  Manhattan Bank  and the\n\nCentral Bank in Miami.  \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          At   the  time  of  the  pickup,  one  of  Matiz's\n\nassistants followed  an undercover  agent  to the  warehouse\n\nwhere the  car was loaded.  Matiz,  however, remained behind\n\nat  the  hotel with  another  undercover  agent who  was  to\n\naccompany her to a meeting  with Alvarez.  On the  way, they\n\ndecided  to purchase a bottle  of champagne to celebrate the\n\ndeal.    Upon arriving at the  liquor store, an agent placed\n\nMatiz under arrest.\n\n                           II.  \n\n              A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Matiz  first  disingenuously   contends  that  the\n\nevidence produced at trial does not show that she knew of or\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy.  Rather, she claims that she\n\n\"recklessly made  a loan  to her friend.\"   In  evaluating a\n\nclaim  of  insufficiency  of the  evidence,  we  \"review the\n\nevidence as  a whole,  including  all reasonable  inferences\n\nfrom  that evidence,  in  the light  most  favorable to  the\n\ngovernment.\"   United States  v. Argencourt, 996  F.2d 1300,\n                                           \n\n1303  (1st  Cir.  1993).    In  addition,  both  direct  and\n\ncircumstantial  evidence must be credited on appeal.  United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Echeverri, 982  F.2d  675, 677  (1st Cir.  1993).\n                    \n\nThus, as long as a jury could rationally find guilt beyond a\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nreasonable doubt, we  must affirm.  Argencourt, 996  F.2d at\n                                              \n\n1303.   \n\n          Matiz  is unable to overcome the very heavy burden\n\nthat a claim  of insufficiency of evidence  places upon her.\n\nThere  is  an  abundance of  evidence  that  Matiz knowingly\n\nparticipated  in  the  conspiracy   to  distribute  cocaine.\n\nGranted, Matiz's role initially was to supply Alvarez with a\n\npayment  of money.  That payment, however, was intrinsically\n\nlinked to the drug conspiracy to  smuggle illicit drugs into\n\nthe United States.  The advance payment would facilitate the\n\ntransportation  of the cocaine.  In addition, the Government\n\npresented evidence at trial that Matiz spoke to Alvarez over\n\nthirty times, in  code, with respect to the  shipment of the\n\ncocaine.    Moreover, the  facsimile from  the suppliers  in\n\nColombia  noted that Matiz was  an intended recipient of the\n\ncocaine.\n\n          Finally, Matiz  organized and directed  the pickup\n\noperation in Massachusetts.  Although she herself did not go\n\ndown to load the cocaine, she  sent an assistant of hers  to\n\ndo  the task.    The  jury simply  did  not believe  Matiz's\n\nincredible story concerning  her lack of involvement  in the\n\nconspiracy.  Because of the abundance of evidence supporting\n\nthe jury's verdict, this challenge is rejected.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n               B.  Outrageous Government Misconduct\n\n          Matiz  next contends that her conviction should be\n\noverturned because the  Government's conduct throughout  the\n\ncourse   of   the   investigation   constituted   outrageous\n\nmisconduct  in violation  of  her Due  Process rights.   Her\n\nclaim essentially rests  on the  Government's initiation  of\n\nthe transaction, the arranged transportation of  the cocaine\n\ninto  the country, and  its delivery to  various individuals\n\nincluding herself.  \n\n          Law  enforcement  conduct  runs afoul  of  the Due\n\nProcess  Clause  of  the Fifth  Amendment  when  it violates\n\n\"fundamental fairness,  shocking to  the universal  sense of\n\njustice.\"   United  States  v. Russell,  411  U.S. 423,  432\n                                      \n\n(1973) (quoting Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton,\n                                                           \n\n361  U.S. 234,  246 (1960)).    See also  Hampton v.

Santana,       F.3d     1993 WL\n                                                   \n\n345746 (1st Cir.  1993); United States v.

We  have recognized that in these  modern times with\n\nadvanced  technology and  transportation facilities  readily\n\navailable to criminals, drug  conspiracies, especially of an\n\ninternational   character,   are  extremely   difficult   to\n\npenetrate  and  therefore   enforcement  ingenuity  must  be\n\nencouraged and greater government involvement allowed.   See\n                                                            \n\nBarnett, 989 F.2d  at 560;  Panitz,  907 F.2d at 1273.   The\n                                  \n\nextent  of  government   involvement  here,  initiating  the\n\ntransaction and transporting and  delivering the cocaine, is\n\nno more  excessive than  government actions  that have  been\n\nupheld  in other  cases.    See Panitz,  907  F.2d at  1273;\n                                      \n\nMarino, 936 F.2d at 27.\n      \n\n          Law   enforcement   conduct   does   not   violate\n\nfundamental fairness when government officials do not foment\n\ncrime,  cf.  Twigg,  588  F.2d  at  381,  but  resourcefully\n                  \n\npenetrate  an existing  drug  ring  and  engage  in  limited\n\nparticipation   in   their   unlawful  practices.      \"Such\n\ninfiltration  is  a  recognized  and  permissible  means  of\n\ninvestigation; if that  be so, then the supply  of some item\n\nof  value that  the drug  ring requires  must, as  a general\n\nrule, also be permissible.\"  Russell, 411 U.S.  at 432.  The\n                                    \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nrecord demonstrates that Matiz was an important figure in an\n\norganized  conspiracy  to smuggle  illicit  drugs into  this\n\ncountry and distribute  them.  When the  Colombian suppliers\n\nneeded  money  to  facilitate  the  transportation  in  this\n\ncountry, they turned to her.  The suppliers' instructions to\n\ntheir associates in this country also filtered through her.\n\n          The  Government did not  entice Matiz  to purchase\n\nand  distribute  cocaine.    She  already  had  an  existing\n\narrangement with  her  suppliers  in  Colombia  and  eagerly\n\nsought a substantial  share of the smuggled drug  load after\n\nit reached this country.  Government agents never sought her\n\nout; the Colombian  suppliers arranged to have  Alvarez meet\n\nher.   The  Government,  at the  request  of the  suppliers,\n\nmerely facilitated the transportation of the drugs into this\n\ncountry  and Matiz freely joined  in the arrangements and in\n\nacquiring   a  share  of  the  contraband.    Moreover,  the\n\nGovernment  did not take  part in processing,  packaging, or\n\nlabelling any of the 615 kilograms of cocaine.  Furthermore,\n\nthey delivered  the cocaine to individuals  predetermined by\n\nthe suppliers.   We do not believe  that the conduct of  the\n\nagents employing guile, deception, and clever  stratagems in\n\ninfiltrating the Colombian drug ring and communicating  with\n\nMatiz at the direction of  the suppliers to obtain funds for\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nthe  transportation of the drugs to this country constituted\n\noutrageous  and impermissible conduct.  See Panitz, 907 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 1273.\n\n          As an  alternative to vacating  Matiz's conviction\n\nbased  on  the  Government's violation  of  her  Due Process\n\nrights, Matiz requests  that this court use  its supervisory\n\npower to reverse  her conviction.  Guided  by considerations\n\nof justice, federal courts  may exercise on a limited  basis\n\ntheir supervisory power  to \"formulate procedural  rules not\n\nspecifically required  by the Constitution or the Congress.\"\n\nUnited States  v. Hasting,  461 U.S. 499,  505 (1983).   The\n                         \n\nSupreme Court has recognized  only three legitimate purposes\n\nfor  the  exercise  of  a  court's  supervisory  power:  \"To\n\nimplement  a remedy for  violation of recognized  rights, to\n\npreserve judicial integrity, . .  . and finally, as a remedy\n\ndesigned  to deter future  illegal conduct.   Id. (citations\n                                                 \n\nomitted).      Neither of  these three bases  are applicable\n\nto  the  case  sub judice.    As  discussed previously,  the\n                         \n\nGovernment's  conduct was not outrageous, and Matiz fails to\n\nshow any specific violation of a statutory or constitutional\n\nright.   Moreover preserving  judicial integrity  is only  a\n\nbasis for a court to  use its supervisory power to supervise\n\nits  own  affairs,  not  the  affairs  of  other  government\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nbranches.  The court's supervisory power does not \"justify a\n\nchancellor's foot veto  over activities of  coequal branches\n\nof government.\"  Id. at 1089 (citations omitted).  Since the\n                    \n\nconduct alleged by  Matiz to be outrageous  occurred outside\n\nthe  courtroom,  judicial  integrity  is  not  at  risk  and\n\ntherefore cannot  be used as a  basis for a court  to invoke\n\nits supervisory  power.  See id.    Finally, since there was\n                                \n\nno past illegal  conduct on the part of  the Government with\n\nrespect to Matiz, we could  not use our supervisory power to\n\ndeter  it from  engaging in  future,  illegal conduct.   See\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.  Simpson, 927  F.2d 1088,  1091 (9th  Cir.\n                          \n\n1991).   Thus,  the  use  of our  supervisory  power is  not\n\nwarranted under the present facts. \n\n         C.  Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n\n          Finally,  Matiz  presents  two  challenges to  the\n\ndistrict court's enhancement of her sentence for obstruction\n\nof  justice  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.     3C1.1.    Her  first\n\nchallenge is that the district court failed to make specific\n\nfindings necessary to establish perjury. \n\n          Section  3C1.1  requires  a  sentencing  court  to\n\nenhance a defendant's sentence level by two points \"[i]f the\n\ndefendant willfully  obstructed or impeded,  or attempted to\n\nobstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n. .  . prosecution  . .  .   of the  instant offense.\"   The\n\ncommentary to   3C1.1 provides that committing perjury is an\n\nexample  of the  type of conduct  to which  this enhancement\n\napplies. U.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment (n. 3(b)).   The Supreme\n\nCourt  has stated  that  a  witness  testifying  under  oath\n\ncommits perjury if  \"she gives false testimony  concerning a\n\nmaterial matter  with the  willful intent  to provide  false\n\ntestimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or\n\nfaulty memory.\"  United States v. Dunnigan, 113 S. Ct. 1111,\n                                          \n\n1116 (1993).   An enhancement for  obstruction of justice is\n\nsufficiently  supported where  a  sentencing  court makes  a\n\nfinding  \"that encompasses all of the factual predicates for\n\na  finding of perjury\".  Id. at 1117.  At Matiz's sentencing\n                           \n\nthe court made the following finding:  \n\n          I  don't need  to  address the  issue of\n          Ramirez.2  I  do not wish to  imply that\n          a defendant  does not  have  a right  to\n          testify.      I  make   an   independent\n          determination here that I simply did not\n          credit Ms. Matiz' testimony when she did\n          testify.  It's  my determination that  I\n          do  not believe her.  I believe that she\n          knowingly  told   a  false   story  and,\n          accordingly,    will    overrule     the\n\n                    \n\n2The  court's  reference  to   \"Ramirez\"  concerns  evidence\npresented at  trial that Matiz used an alias, Maria Ramirez.\nOn  cross-examination, Matiz  denied  using the  alias, even\nthough a social security card and an apartment lease bearing\nthat name  were  found  in  her diary.    Additionally,  her\nlandlord identified her as the woman he knew as Ramirez.\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          objection.  It's  appropriate to have an\n          upward  adjustment  for  obstruction  of\n          justice in this case.\n\nThe  court  also stated  that  it \"finds  the  defendant did\n\ncommit perjury.\"\n\n          The findings encompass all the elements of perjury\n\n--  falsity,  materiality, and willfulness.  The only matter\n\nabout which the court was  not explicit was whether  Matiz's\n\ntestimony was material.  A sentencing court, however, is not\n\nrequired to address  each element of  perjury in a  separate\n\nand clear finding.  See id.  In fact, the Court  in Dunnigan\n                                                            \n\naffirmed a  district court's  finding that  did not  use the\n\nterm willful.3  Id. at 1113.  Dunnigan  only requires that a\n                                      \n\nsentencing  court's  findings encompass  all of  the factual\n\npredicates for a finding of perjury.  \n\n                    \n\n33The finding at issue in Dunnigan stated: \n                                  \n\n          The court finds  that the defendant  was\n          untruthful  at  trial  with  respect  to\n          material  matters in  this  case.   [B]y\n          virtue of her  failure to give  truthful\n          testimony on material  matters that were\n          designed  to  substantially  affect  the\n          outcome of the case, the court concludes\n          that  the   false  testimony   at  trial\n          warrants  an  upward adjustment  by  two\n          levels.\n\nDunnigan, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.\n        \n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\n             Moreover, the record  demonstrates that Matiz's\n\nfalse  testimony denying  knowledge of and  participation in\n\nthe conspiracy was  material.  If  believed, the jury  would\n\nhave acquitted her.  Thus,  we can make the determination of\n\nmateriality on  our own  without remanding  to the  district\n\ncourt.   See  United States  v.  Arias-Villanueva, 998  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1491, 1513 (9th Cir.), cert.  denied, 114 S. Ct. 359 (1993).\n                                    \n\nTherefore,  the challenge to the district court's failure to\n\nmake specific findings is rejected.  \n\n          Matiz  also  contends   that  the  district  court\n\nerroneously found that she committed perjury inasmuch as the\n\nrecord  contains no  evidence  of  material  untruths.    In\n\nreviewing a court's application of the sentencing guidelines\n\nto facts of  a case, we use a  \"clearly erroneous\" standard.\n\nSee United States  v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437  (1st Cir. 1989).\n                            \n\nWe perceive  no  clear error;  on the  contrary, the  record\n\noverwhelmingly supports the district court's finding.  \n\n          Throughout her  testimony, Matiz  argued that  she\n\nmerely loaned money  to a friend and that  she was otherwise\n\nunconnected  to  the  drug  conspiracy.     The  Government,\n\nhowever,  rebutted  her  explanation  and  proved  at  trial\n\nthrough  the use of recordings and testimony from Government\n\nagents that  she  was  intimately   connected  to  the  drug\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nconspiracy.   Thus, we  cannot say that  the district  court\n\ncommitted error in finding that Matiz perjured herself.\n\n                            III.\n\n          In  sum, we  conclude  that:    (1)  the  evidence\n\nintroduced  against  Matiz  was sufficient  to  support  the\n\nguilty verdict  returned by  the jury,  (2) the  Goverment's\n\nconduct was not outrageous, and  (3) the district court  did\n\nnot  err  in  enhancing  her  sentence  for  obstruction  of\n\njustice.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is \n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n",

Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Matiz appeals her conviction and argues that:  (1) the evidence introduced against her was insufficient to support the guilty verdict returned by the jury, (2) her conviction should be reversed on the grounds that the Government's conduct was outrageous, and (3) the district court erred in enhancing her sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to Sec. 3C1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  We affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arose out of a large scale investigation conducted by various government agencies in the United States and Colombia, South America into the cocaine distribution activities of a number of individuals.  The United States Government (the Government) had the assistance of Pedro Alvarez, a defendant in another criminal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez, at the behest of the Government, posed as a purchaser and contacted a number of cocaine suppliers in Colombia.  Negotiations ensued over several months pertaining to the purchase of large quantities of cocaine.  In the early part of 1991, the suppliers in Colombia informed Alvarez that they were experiencing temporary difficulties in smuggling the cocaine into the United States.  In light of these difficulties, they asked Alvarez to assist them in transporting the shipment.  Additionally, the suppliers asked Alvarez to store and distribute the cocaine to their associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government told Alvarez to request an up-front payment of $30,000 for his troubles and expenses.  Reluctantly, the suppliers agreed and informed Alvarez that the payment would be made by one of their New York based associates, \"La Negra,\" a code name for Matiz.  The suppliers gave Alvarez \"La Negra's\" beeper number and code phrase for communication with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez and Matiz ultimately scheduled a meeting for May 23, 1991, for Matiz to hand over the money to an associate of Alvarez, actually Special Agent Dominick Lopez, at a Burger King restaurant in Queens, New York.  At the scheduled hour, Matiz, along with an associate named Diaz, drove to the meeting place in a Nissan Pathfinder.  After Lopez entered the vehicle, Matiz instructed Diaz to get the money.  Diaz retrieved the money from under the seat of the automobile and passed it to Matiz who then gave it to Lopez.  The sum, however, amounted to only $20,000 and Matiz promised to make an additional payment of $5,000 the next day, explaining that she had been told that the amount due was $25,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this exchange, Matiz remained in close contact with Alvarez.  She informed him that she was personally expecting to receive a large portion of the cocaine shipment upon its arrival.  The suppliers in Colombia confirmed this information both in conversations with Alvarez and in facsimile messages sent to him.  The shipment consisting of 615 kilograms of cocaine finally arrived in the United States on June 4, 1991.  On June 5, 1991, the suppliers sent Alvarez written instructions by facsimile from Colombia regarding the distribution of the cocaine.  The instructions directed that, among others, Matiz should receive 51 1/2 kilograms of the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez telephoned Matiz on numerous occasions to discuss the details of the pickup of her portion of the cocaine.  During these conversations, Matiz expressed her desire to obtain her portion of the cocaine as soon as possible.  Initially, she also voiced an interest in purchasing some of the cocaine that Alvarez had received as his fee for transporting the cocaine.  Ultimately, however, she decided against it because of financial constraints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alvarez informed Matiz that she would be able to pick up her portion of the cocaine on June 12, 1991.  He reserved a hotel room for Matiz in Middleboro, Massachusetts near the site for the transfer of the cocaine.  Matiz and Diaz arrived at the hotel on June 10.  In a continued effort to conceal their identities, they checked into the hotel using fictitious names and addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following evening, Alvarez and Special Agent Dillon met Matiz at the hotel to review the final arrangements for the pickup.  A number of Matiz's assistants, who had arrived at the hotel on the same day as Matiz, were designated to collect the cocaine.  Also, during this meeting, Agent Dillon gave Matiz a facsimile message from the suppliers that they sent to Alvarez instructing her to deposit the purchase price for the cocaine in various accounts in branches of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Central Bank in Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the pickup, one of Matiz's assistants followed an undercover agent to the warehouse where the car was loaded.  Matiz, however, remained behind at the hotel with another undercover agent who was to accompany her to a meeting with Alvarez.  On the way, they decided to purchase a bottle of champagne to celebrate the deal. Upon arriving at the liquor store, an agent placed Matiz under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz first disingenuously contends that the evidence produced at trial does not show that she knew of or participated in the conspiracy.  Rather, she claims that she \"recklessly made a loan to her friend.\"   In evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the evidence as a whole, including all reasonable inferences from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the government.\"  United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1303 (1st Cir.1993).  In addition, both direct and circumstantial evidence must be credited on appeal.  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993).  Thus, as long as a jury could rationally find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm.  Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz is unable to overcome the very heavy burden that a claim of insufficiency of evidence places upon her.  There is an abundance of evidence that Matiz knowingly participated in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  Granted, Matiz's role initially was to supply Alvarez with a payment of money.  That payment, however, was intrinsically linked to the drug conspiracy to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States.  The advance payment would facilitate the transportation of the cocaine.  In addition, the Government presented evidence at trial that Matiz spoke to Alvarez over thirty times, in code, with respect to the shipment of the cocaine.  Moreover, the facsimile from the suppliers in Colombia noted that Matiz was an intended recipient of the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Matiz organized and directed the pickup operation in Massachusetts.  Although she herself did not go down to load the cocaine, she sent an assistant of hers to do the task.  The jury simply did not believe Matiz's incredible story concerning her lack of involvement in the conspiracy.  Because of the abundance of evidence supporting the jury's verdict, this challenge is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Outrageous Government Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz next contends that her conviction should be overturned because the Government's conduct throughout the course of the investigation constituted outrageous misconduct in violation of her Due Process rights.  Her claim essentially rests on the Government's initiation of the transaction, the arranged transportation of the cocaine into the country, and its delivery to various individuals including herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement conduct runs afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it violates \"fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice.\"  United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973) (quoting Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234, 246, 80 S.Ct. 297, 304, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960)).  See also Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 491-95, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1650-53, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring);  id. at 495-500, 96 S.Ct. at 1653-55 (Brennan, J., dissenting);  United States v. Twigg, 588 F.2d 373, 381 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has reviewed many claims similar to the one advanced here and has consistently rejected them.  See, e.g., United States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 560 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993);  United States v. Marino, 936 F.2d 23, 26-27 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1272-73 (1st Cir.1990).  We have recognized that in these modern times with advanced technology and transportation facilities readily available to criminals, drug conspiracies, especially of an international character, are extremely difficult to penetrate and therefore enforcement ingenuity must be encouraged and greater government involvement allowed.  See Barnett, 989 F.2d at 560;  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.   The extent of government involvement here, initiating the transaction and transporting and delivering the cocaine, is no more excessive than government actions that have been upheld in other cases.  See Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273;  Marino, 936 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement conduct does not violate fundamental fairness when government officials do not foment crime, cf. Twigg, 588 F.2d at 381, but resourcefully penetrate an existing drug ring and engage in limited participation in their unlawful practices.  \"Such infiltration is a recognized and permissible means of investigation;  if that be so, then the supply of some item of value that the drug ring requires must, as a general rule, also be permissible.\"  Russell, 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643.   The record demonstrates that Matiz was an important figure in an organized conspiracy to smuggle illicit drugs into this country and distribute them.  When the Colombian suppliers needed money to facilitate the transportation in this country, they turned to her.  The suppliers' instructions to their associates in this country also filtered through her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government did not entice Matiz to purchase and distribute cocaine.  She already had an existing arrangement with her suppliers in Colombia and eagerly sought a substantial share of the smuggled drug load after it reached this country.  Government agents never sought her out;  the Colombian suppliers arranged to have Alvarez meet her.  The Government, at the request of the suppliers, merely facilitated the transportation of the drugs into this country and Matiz freely joined in the arrangements and in acquiring a share of the contraband.  Moreover, the Government did not take part in processing, packaging, or labelling any of the 615 kilograms of cocaine.  Furthermore, they delivered the cocaine to individuals predetermined by the suppliers.  We do not believe that the conduct of the agents employing guile, deception, and clever stratagems in infiltrating the Colombian drug ring and communicating with Matiz at the direction of the suppliers to obtain funds for the transportation of the drugs to this country constituted outrageous and impermissible conduct.  See Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to vacating Matiz's conviction based on the Government's violation of her Due Process rights, Matiz requests that this court use its supervisory power to reverse her conviction.  Guided by considerations of justice, federal courts may exercise on a limited basis their supervisory power to \"formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress.\"  United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1978, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).  The Supreme Court has recognized only three legitimate purposes for the exercise of a court's supervisory power:  \"To implement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity, ... and finally, as a remedy designed to deter future illegal conduct.\"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these three bases are applicable to the case sub judice.   As discussed previously, the Government's conduct was not outrageous, and Matiz fails to show any specific violation of a statutory or constitutional right.  Moreover, preserving judicial integrity is only a basis for a court to use its supervisory power to supervise its own affairs, not the affairs of other government branches.  The court's supervisory power does not \"justify a chancellor's foot veto over activities of coequal branches of government.\"   See United States v. Simpson, 927 F.2d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.1991) (citations omitted).  Since the conduct alleged by Matiz to be outrageous occurred outside the courtroom, judicial integrity is not at risk and therefore cannot be used as a basis for a court to invoke its supervisory power.  See id.   Finally, since there was no past illegal conduct on the part of the Government with respect to Matiz, we could not use our supervisory power to deter it from engaging in future, illegal conduct.  See Id. at 1091.   Thus, the use of our supervisory power is not warranted under the present facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Matiz presents two challenges to the district court's enhancement of her sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  Her first challenge is that the district court failed to make specific findings necessary to establish perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3C1.1 requires a sentencing court to enhance a defendant's sentence level by two points \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the ... prosecution ... of the instant offense.\"   The commentary to Sec. 3C1.1 provides that committing perjury is an example of the type of conduct to which this enhancement applies.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment (n. 3(b)).  The Supreme Court has stated that a witness testifying under oath commits perjury if \"she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"  United States v. Dunnigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An enhancement for obstruction of justice is sufficiently supported where a sentencing court makes a finding \"that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury\".  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.   At Matiz's sentencing the court made the following finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>I don't need to address the issue of Ramirez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  I do not wish to imply that a defendant does not have a right to testify.  I make an independent determination here that I simply did not credit Ms. Matiz' testimony when she did testify.  It's my determination that I do not believe her.  I believe that she knowingly told a false story and, accordingly, will overrule the objection.  It's appropriate to have an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also stated that it \"finds the defendant did commit perjury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings encompass all the elements of perjury--falsity, materiality, and willfulness.  The only matter about which the court was not explicit was whether Matiz's testimony was material.  A sentencing court, however, is not required to address each element of perjury in a separate and clear finding.  See id.   In fact, the Court in Dunnigan affirmed a district court's finding that did not use the term willful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1113.  Dunnigan only requires that a sentencing court's findings encompass all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record demonstrates that Matiz's false testimony denying knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy was material.  If believed, the jury would have acquitted her.  Thus, we can make the determination of materiality on our own without remanding to the district court.  See United States v. Arias-Villanueva, 998 F.2d 1491, 1513 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 359, 126 L.Ed.2d 322 (1993).  Therefore, the challenge to the district court's failure to make specific findings is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz also contends that the district court erroneously found that she committed perjury inasmuch as the record contains no evidence of material untruths.  In reviewing a court's application of the sentencing guidelines to facts of a case, we use a \"clearly erroneous\" standard.  See United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437 (1st Cir.1989).  We perceive no clear error;  on the contrary, the record overwhelmingly supports the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout her testimony, Matiz argued that she merely loaned money to a friend and that she was otherwise unconnected to the drug conspiracy.  The Government, however, rebutted her explanation and proved at trial through the use of recordings and testimony from Government agents that she was intimately connected to the drug conspiracy.  Thus, we cannot say that the district court committed error in finding that Matiz perjured herself.III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that:  (1) the evidence introduced against Matiz was sufficient to support the guilty verdict returned by the jury, (2) the Government's conduct was not outrageous, and (3) the district court did not err in enhancing her sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Matiz appeals her conviction and argues that:  (1) the evidence introduced against her was insufficient to support the guilty verdict returned by the jury, (2) her conviction should be reversed on the grounds that the Government's conduct was outrageous, and (3) the district court erred in enhancing her sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to Sec. 3C1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  We affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arose out of a large scale investigation conducted by various government agencies in the United States and Colombia, South America into the cocaine distribution activities of a number of individuals.  The United States Government (the Government) had the assistance of Pedro Alvarez, a defendant in another criminal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez, at the behest of the Government, posed as a purchaser and contacted a number of cocaine suppliers in Colombia.  Negotiations ensued over several months pertaining to the purchase of large quantities of cocaine.  In the early part of 1991, the suppliers in Colombia informed Alvarez that they were experiencing temporary difficulties in smuggling the cocaine into the United States.  In light of these difficulties, they asked Alvarez to assist them in transporting the shipment.  Additionally, the suppliers asked Alvarez to store and distribute the cocaine to their associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government told Alvarez to request an up-front payment of $30,000 for his troubles and expenses.  Reluctantly, the suppliers agreed and informed Alvarez that the payment would be made by one of their New York based associates, \"La Negra,\" a code name for Matiz.  The suppliers gave Alvarez \"La Negra's\" beeper number and code phrase for communication with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez and Matiz ultimately scheduled a meeting for May 23, 1991, for Matiz to hand over the money to an associate of Alvarez, actually Special Agent Dominick Lopez, at a Burger King restaurant in Queens, New York.  At the scheduled hour, Matiz, along with an associate named Diaz, drove to the meeting place in a Nissan Pathfinder.  After Lopez entered the vehicle, Matiz instructed Diaz to get the money.  Diaz retrieved the money from under the seat of the automobile and passed it to Matiz who then gave it to Lopez.  The sum, however, amounted to only $20,000 and Matiz promised to make an additional payment of $5,000 the next day, explaining that she had been told that the amount due was $25,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this exchange, Matiz remained in close contact with Alvarez.  She informed him that she was personally expecting to receive a large portion of the cocaine shipment upon its arrival.  The suppliers in Colombia confirmed this information both in conversations with Alvarez and in facsimile messages sent to him.  The shipment consisting of 615 kilograms of cocaine finally arrived in the United States on June 4, 1991.  On June 5, 1991, the suppliers sent Alvarez written instructions by facsimile from Colombia regarding the distribution of the cocaine.  The instructions directed that, among others, Matiz should receive 51 1/2 kilograms of the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez telephoned Matiz on numerous occasions to discuss the details of the pickup of her portion of the cocaine.  During these conversations, Matiz expressed her desire to obtain her portion of the cocaine as soon as possible.  Initially, she also voiced an interest in purchasing some of the cocaine that Alvarez had received as his fee for transporting the cocaine.  Ultimately, however, she decided against it because of financial constraints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alvarez informed Matiz that she would be able to pick up her portion of the cocaine on June 12, 1991.  He reserved a hotel room for Matiz in Middleboro, Massachusetts near the site for the transfer of the cocaine.  Matiz and Diaz arrived at the hotel on June 10.  In a continued effort to conceal their identities, they checked into the hotel using fictitious names and addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following evening, Alvarez and Special Agent Dillon met Matiz at the hotel to review the final arrangements for the pickup.  A number of Matiz's assistants, who had arrived at the hotel on the same day as Matiz, were designated to collect the cocaine.  Also, during this meeting, Agent Dillon gave Matiz a facsimile message from the suppliers that they sent to Alvarez instructing her to deposit the purchase price for the cocaine in various accounts in branches of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Central Bank in Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the pickup, one of Matiz's assistants followed an undercover agent to the warehouse where the car was loaded.  Matiz, however, remained behind at the hotel with another undercover agent who was to accompany her to a meeting with Alvarez.  On the way, they decided to purchase a bottle of champagne to celebrate the deal. Upon arriving at the liquor store, an agent placed Matiz under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz first disingenuously contends that the evidence produced at trial does not show that she knew of or participated in the conspiracy.  Rather, she claims that she \"recklessly made a loan to her friend.\"   In evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the evidence as a whole, including all reasonable inferences from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the government.\"  United States v. Argencourt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610550\"><a href=\"/opinion/610550/united-states-v-joseph-argencourt-aka-joe-black-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, 1303 (1st Cir.1993).  In addition, both direct and circumstantial evidence must be credited on appeal.  United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir.1993).  Thus, as long as a jury could rationally find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm.  Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz is unable to overcome the very heavy burden that a claim of insufficiency of evidence places upon her.  There is an abundance of evidence that Matiz knowingly participated in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  Granted, Matiz's role initially was to supply Alvarez with a payment of money.  That payment, however, was intrinsically linked to the drug conspiracy to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States.  The advance payment would facilitate the transportation of the cocaine.  In addition, the Government presented evidence at trial that Matiz spoke to Alvarez over thirty times, in code, with respect to the shipment of the cocaine.  Moreover, the facsimile from the suppliers in Colombia noted that Matiz was an intended recipient of the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Matiz organized and directed the pickup operation in Massachusetts.  Although she herself did not go down to load the cocaine, she sent an assistant of hers to do the task.  The jury simply did not believe Matiz's incredible story concerning her lack of involvement in the conspiracy.  Because of the abundance of evidence supporting the jury's verdict, this challenge is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Outrageous Government Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz next contends that her conviction should be overturned because the Government's conduct throughout the course of the investigation constituted outrageous misconduct in violation of her Due Process rights.  Her claim essentially rests on the Government's initiation of the transaction, the arranged transportation of the cocaine into the country, and its delivery to various individuals including herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement conduct runs afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it violates \"fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice.\"  United States v.

We have recognized that in these modern times with advanced technology and transportation facilities readily available to criminals, drug conspiracies, especially of an international character, are extremely difficult to penetrate and therefore enforcement ingenuity must be encouraged and greater government involvement allowed.  See Barnett, 989 F.2d at 560;  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.   The extent of government involvement here, initiating the transaction and transporting and delivering the cocaine, is no more excessive than government actions that have been upheld in other cases.  See Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273;  Marino, 936 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law enforcement conduct does not violate fundamental fairness when government officials do not foment crime, cf. Twigg, 588 F.2d at 381, but resourcefully penetrate an existing drug ring and engage in limited participation in their unlawful practices.  \"Such infiltration is a recognized and permissible means of investigation;  if that be so, then the supply of some item of value that the drug ring requires must, as a general rule, also be permissible.\"  Russell, 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643.   The record demonstrates that Matiz was an important figure in an organized conspiracy to smuggle illicit drugs into this country and distribute them.  When the Colombian suppliers needed money to facilitate the transportation in this country, they turned to her.  The suppliers' instructions to their associates in this country also filtered through her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government did not entice Matiz to purchase and distribute cocaine.  She already had an existing arrangement with her suppliers in Colombia and eagerly sought a substantial share of the smuggled drug load after it reached this country.  Government agents never sought her out;  the Colombian suppliers arranged to have Alvarez meet her.  The Government, at the request of the suppliers, merely facilitated the transportation of the drugs into this country and Matiz freely joined in the arrangements and in acquiring a share of the contraband.  Moreover, the Government did not take part in processing, packaging, or labelling any of the 615 kilograms of cocaine.  Furthermore, they delivered the cocaine to individuals predetermined by the suppliers.  We do not believe that the conduct of the agents employing guile, deception, and clever stratagems in infiltrating the Colombian drug ring and communicating with Matiz at the direction of the suppliers to obtain funds for the transportation of the drugs to this country constituted outrageous and impermissible conduct.  See Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to vacating Matiz's conviction based on the Government's violation of her Due Process rights, Matiz requests that this court use its supervisory power to reverse her conviction.  Guided by considerations of justice, federal courts may exercise on a limited basis their supervisory power to \"formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress.\"  United States v.

(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these three bases are applicable to the case sub judice.   As discussed previously, the Government's conduct was not outrageous, and Matiz fails to show any specific violation of a statutory or constitutional right.  Moreover, preserving judicial integrity is only a basis for a court to use its supervisory power to supervise its own affairs, not the affairs of other government branches.  The court's supervisory power does not \"justify a chancellor's foot veto over activities of coequal branches of government.\"   See United States v. Simpson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557268\"><a href=\"/opinion/557268/united-states-v-darrel-simpson-robert-anderson-james-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, 1089 (9th Cir.1991) (citations omitted).  Since the conduct alleged by Matiz to be outrageous occurred outside the courtroom, judicial integrity is not at risk and therefore cannot be used as a basis for a court to invoke its supervisory power.  See id.   Finally, since there was no past illegal conduct on the part of the Government with respect to Matiz, we could not use our supervisory power to deter it from engaging in future, illegal conduct.  See Id. at 1091.   Thus, the use of our supervisory power is not warranted under the present facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Matiz presents two challenges to the district court's enhancement of her sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  Her first challenge is that the district court failed to make specific findings necessary to establish perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3C1.1 requires a sentencing court to enhance a defendant's sentence level by two points \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the ... prosecution ... of the instant offense.\"   The commentary to Sec. 3C1.1 provides that committing perjury is an example of the type of conduct to which this enhancement applies.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment (n. 3(b)).  The Supreme Court has stated that a witness testifying under oath commits perjury if \"she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"  United States v. Dunnigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span>, 1116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An enhancement for obstruction of justice is sufficiently supported where a sentencing court makes a finding \"that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury\".  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.   At Matiz's sentencing the court made the following finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>I don't need to address the issue of Ramirez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  I do not wish to imply that a defendant does not have a right to testify.  I make an independent determination here that I simply did not credit Ms. Matiz' testimony when she did testify.  It's my determination that I do not believe her.  I believe that she knowingly told a false story and, accordingly, will overrule the objection.  It's appropriate to have an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also stated that it \"finds the defendant did commit perjury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings encompass all the elements of perjury--falsity, materiality, and willfulness.  The only matter about which the court was not explicit was whether Matiz's testimony was material.  A sentencing court, however, is not required to address each element of perjury in a separate and clear finding.  See id.   In fact, the Court in Dunnigan affirmed a district court's finding that did not use the term willful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1113.  Dunnigan only requires that a sentencing court's findings encompass all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record demonstrates that Matiz's false testimony denying knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy was material.  If believed, the jury would have acquitted her.  Thus, we can make the determination of materiality on our own without remanding to the district court.  See United States v. Arias-Villanueva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611597\"><a href=\"/opinion/611597/united-states-v-david-arias-villanueva-united-states-of-america-v-carlos/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1491</span></a></span>, 1513 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span> (1993).  Therefore, the challenge to the district court's failure to make specific findings is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matiz also contends that the district court erroneously found that she committed perjury inasmuch as the record contains no evidence of material untruths.  In reviewing a court's application of the sentencing guidelines to facts of a case, we use a \"clearly erroneous\" standard.  See United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522147\"><a href=\"/opinion/522147/united-states-v-bertie-alexander-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989).  We perceive no clear error;  on the contrary, the record overwhelmingly supports the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout her testimony, Matiz argued that she merely loaned money to a friend and that she was otherwise unconnected to the drug conspiracy.  The Government, however, rebutted her explanation and proved at trial through the use of recordings and testimony from Government agents that she was intimately connected to the drug conspiracy.  Thus, we cannot say that the district court committed error in finding that Matiz perjured herself.III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that:  (1) the evidence introduced against Matiz was sufficient to support the guilty verdict returned by the jury, (2) the Government's conduct was not outrageous, and (3) the district court did not err in enhancing her sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3231.  This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(a)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court's reference to \"Ramirez\" concerns evidence presented at trial that Matiz used an alias, Maria Ramirez.  On cross-examination, Matiz denied using the alias, even though a social security card and an apartment lease bearing that name were found in her diary.  Additionally, her landlord identified her as the woman he knew as Ramirez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The finding at issue in Dunnigan stated:</p>\n        <p>The court finds that the defendant was untruthful at trial with respect to material matters in this case.  [B]y virtue of her failure to give truthful testimony on material matters that were designed to substantially affect the outcome of the case, the court concludes that the false testimony at trial warrants an upward adjustment by two levels.</p>\n        <p>Dunnigan, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
