Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER,       Associate      Justice.         The     appellee       Paradigm\n\nBiodevices, Inc. does business in Massachusetts producing and\n\ndistributing medical equipment.                  It contracted with a Georgia\n\ncorporation, the plaintiff-appellant Vertex Surgical, Inc., to act\n\nas a sales representative in Georgia and portions of nearby states.\n\nThe    written     contract       had     both     a    choice      of     law     clause\n\n(Massachusetts) and a forum selection provision (Massachusetts\n\nfederal court).         When Paradigm terminated the agreement, Vertex\n\ncharged    it    with    breach    and    sued    in    the     district       court   for\n\nMassachusetts,        claiming    among    other       things    that    Paradigm      had\n\nviolated the Georgia Wholesale Distribution Act, Ga. Code Ann.\n\n§§ 10-1-700 et seq., which requires payment of sales commissions\n\nwithin 30 days after termination of a contract like the one in\n\nquestion, and provides penalties for failure.                       The Act further\n\ndeclares that its provisions “may not be waived,” and directs that\n\n“the   courts    of     this   state     shall   not    recognize        any    purported\n\nwaiver.”    Ga. Code Ann. § 10-1-703.\n\n            Vertex       moved    for    summary       judgment    on     the    Georgia\n\nstatutory claim, which the district court understood to depend on\n\nwhether the Georgia law “can affect the rights of the parties,\n\ngiven the Agreement’s choice of Massachusetts law to govern the\n\nterms of the Agreement.”           The court concluded that it could not:\n\nthe statute “ultimately attempts to provide further regulation of\n\nthe terms set out in the Agreement” and “[s]uch regulation by\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fGeorgia      law    is    barred     by    the     Agreement’s     choice       to   have\n\n‘Massachusetts law exclusively . . . govern all terms of this\n\nAgreement.’”         Notwithstanding the Georgia statute’s non-waiver\n\nprovision,         the    district        court     concluded      that        applicable\n\nMassachusetts choice of law rules did allow for an effective waiver\n\nby a clause choosing the law of a state other than Georgia, and it\n\ngranted summary judgement on the point sua sponte to Paradigm.                          On\n\nthis de novo review, Rosario v. Dept. of Army,                    607 F.3d 241, 246\n\n(1st Cir. 2010), we think the omission of a preliminary step in the\n\nanalysis undermines the district court’s reasoning, and we thus\n\nvacate and remand.\n\n             The court’s analysis rests on the premise that Vertex\n\nwaived the benefit of the Georgia statute by agreeing to the\n\ncontract’s choice of law provision.                It relied primarily on a case\n\nin   which    we     construed      a   choice     of    law    clause    covering      an\n\n“[a]greement        and    the    rights    and    obligations      of    the     parties\n\n[t]hereto,” Northeast Data Sys., Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Computer\n\nSys. Co., 986 F.2d 607, 609 (1st Cir. 1993), thus assuming that the\n\nprovision     used       here    extends   to     any   issue   that     may    arise   in\n\nlitigation following a claimed breach.                  The parties’ choice of law\n\nclause, however, fell short of such plenary scope.1\n\n\n      1\n       There is no question that it was proper for the district\ncourt to determine the meaning of the contractual terms; absent a\nquestion of extrinsic fact requiring trial (there being none raised\nhere), Massachusetts law treats contract construction as an issue\nfor the court. Teragram Corp. v. Marketwatch.com, Inc., 444 F.3d\n\n                                            -3-\n\f            Both the choice of law and forum selection provisions\n\noccurred in §25.1 of the written agreement.            As for choice of law,\n\nthe parties agreed that “Massachusetts law exclusively shall govern\n\nall     terms   of    this    Agreement,     including     this    paragraph.”\n\n“Agreement” is not a defined term, but its meaning is indicated by\n\nthe   contract’s     title,   “Independent     Agent     Agreement,”   and   an\n\nintegration clause stating that “[t]his Agreement contains the\n\nentire agreement . . . between the parties.” We therefore conclude\n\nthat “Agreement” capitalized refers to what the parties signed,\n\nwith the consequence that “terms” refers to words used in the\n\ndocument, and that law “govern[ing]” them speaks to the source of\n\nrules    used   to   determine   their     meaning.      Matters   apart   from\n\nconstruing “terms” are ostensibly left alone, including any choice\n\nof law issue about the applicability of post-breach statutory\n\nobligations imposed by a state other than Massachusetts having an\n\ninterest in the contractual relationship of principal and sales\n\nagent.\n\n            This reading is confirmed by contrasting the scope of the\n\nchoice of law clause (“all terms of this Agreement”) with that of\n\nthe immediately preceding forum selection clause: “all disputes in\n\nany way relating to, arising under, connected with, or incident to\n\n\n\n\n1, 9 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthis Agreement.”2           Obviously, the phrase “relating to, arising\n\nunder, connected with, or incident to this Agreement” covers a lot\n\nmore       ground    than   “terms    of    this   Agreement,”   and    the   textual\n\ncontrast within the one contract paragraph makes a rather forceful\n\ncase for reading “terms” as “written terms” and leaving the law\n\ngoverning           other    issues        (like    statutory    post-termination\n\nobligations) untouched by the contracting parties. This reading is\n\nalso consistent with Jacobson v. Mailboxes Etc. U.S.A., Inc., 419\n\nMass. 572, 580 n.9, 646 N.E.2d 741, 746 n.9 (1995), in which the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained that a choice of\n\nlaw provision stating “only that the agreement is to be governed\n\nand construed by California law . . . does not purport to bar the\n\napplication         of   [Massachusetts       statutory   law]   to    the    parties’\n\ndealings.”3\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       The forum selection clause requires that all such disputes\nbe brought in federal district court in Boston if possible, or in\nthe Commonwealth’s courts if federal subject matter jurisdiction is\nwanting.\n       3\n        Our   own   decision   in  Northeast   Data   Systems   is\ndistinguishable for two reasons. First, as in Jacobson, the narrow\nchoice of law provision in the parties’ contract here “does not\nstate that the rights of the parties are to be governed by\n[Massachusetts] law,” 419 Mass. at 580 n.9, 646 N.E.2d at 746 n.9;\nsee also Valley Juice Ltd., Inc. v. Evian Waters of France, Inc.,\n87 F.3d 604, 612 (2d Cir. 1996).      And second, Northeast Data\nSystems “was concerned only with a chapter 93A claim under\nMassachusetts law, which (critically) contains no anti-waiver\nprovision.” New England Surfaces v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co.,\n546 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                             -5-\n\f            The choice of law provision here does not bar application\n\nof   the   Georgia   statute   and   therefore   does   not   constitute   a\n\ncontractual waiver by Vertex of its provision.           This leaves open\n\nthe question whether a Massachusetts court would, in the absence of\n\na contractual waiver, recognize and enforce the Georgia statute, a\n\nquestion involving Massachusetts choice of law principles and the\n\nrelated questions of how it might construe and what effect it might\n\ngive to the Georgia statute’s anti-waiver provisions.             Although\n\ntechnically we do not defer to a district court on the meaning of\n\nthe law of the state in which it sits, we nevertheless think it\n\nwould be helpful for the district court to consider this set of\n\nissues in the first instance, possibly aided by more complete\n\nbriefing in light of our resolution of the main issue decided by\n\nthe district court. To allow for that consideration, we vacate the\n\norder of summary judgment for Paradigm on the Georgia statutory\n\nclaim and remand the case to the district court.          Costs are taxed\n\nin favor of Vertex Surgical, Inc.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

Although\n\ntechnically we do not defer to a district court on the meaning of\n\nthe law of the state in which it sits, we nevertheless think it\n\nwould be helpful for the district court to consider this set of\n\nissues in the first instance, possibly aided by more complete\n\nbriefing in light of our resolution of the main issue decided by\n\nthe district court. To allow for that consideration, we vacate the\n\norder of summary judgment for Paradigm on the Georgia statutory\n\nclaim and remand the case to the district court.          Costs are taxed\n\nin favor of Vertex Surgical, Inc.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f</pre>",
