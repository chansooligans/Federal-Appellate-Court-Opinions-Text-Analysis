In this appeal,  defendant-\n          STAHL, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nappellant  Trent Manning challenges,  on several grounds, his\n\nconvictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine,\n\nuse of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\n\ncrime,  and possession  of a  firearm by  a convicted  felon.\n\nManning's principal appellate claim is that improper comments\n\nmade by  the prosecutor  during closing  arguments undermined\n\nthe  fairness of his  trial.   After carefully  reviewing the\n\nrecord,  we conclude  that the  prosecutor's comments  did so\n\ninfect the proceedings  below that Manning  is entitled to  a\n\nnew   trial.    Accordingly,  confining  our  discussion  and\n\nanalysis to the prosecutorial misconduct issue, we vacate the\n\nconvictions.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\nA.  Relevant Factual Background\n                               \n\n          It  is undisputed  that  late in  the afternoon  on\n\nOctober  7, 1991,  several members  of the  Providence Police\n\nDepartment executed  a search  warrant at Manning's  mother's\n\nhouse,  located  at 151  Doyle  Avenue  in Providence,  Rhode\n\nIsland.  In the  course of their search, the  police officers\n\nseized,  inter alia,  a brown  briefcase which  contained the\n                   \n\nmaterial  that  formed  the  basis  of  the  charges  in  the\n\nindictment:    two bags  of  cocaine  weighing 124.64  grams,\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nvarious drug paraphernalia,  a loaded .9 millimeter  handgun,\n\nand six copper pipe bombs.\n\n          It also is undisputed that  just prior to the raid,\n\ntwo men drove up to Manning's mother's house in Manning's red\n\nJeep Cherokee.   The man in the  passenger seat was  one Sean\n\nDuncan, who was detained  by the police but never  charged in\n\nconnection with  this case.   The vehicle's  driver, however,\n\nwas not apprehended at the scene.  The identity of the driver\n\nwas (and is) perhaps  the most hotly contested issue  in this\n\ncase, as it  was (and  is) the government's  theory that  the\n\ndriver brought  the  brown briefcase  into  the house.    The\n\ngovernment argued successfully that  the driver was  Manning;\n\nManning  and Duncan  testified that the  driver was  one Troy\n\nMcKenzie.  The primary government witness on the issue of the\n\ndriver's identity  was Detective  Joseph Lennon, a  member of\n\nthe  search  team that  day.   Lennon  testified  that, after\n\nhaving been given the order to execute the search warrant, he\n\napproached  the rear  of  151  Doyle  Avenue,  where  he  saw\n\nManning, whom he knew and with whom he had conversed on other\n\noccasions,  standing outside the Cherokee and in front of the\n\nhouse's garage.   Lennon  testified that Manning  was holding\n\nthe brown briefcase.  Lennon also testified to seeing  Duncan\n\nseated in the passenger seat of the Cherokee.\n\n          Lennon further testified that, upon seeing Manning,\n\nhe  identified  himself as  a  police officer  and,  with gun\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ndrawn,  ordered  Manning  to  stop.   According  to  Lennon's\n\ntestimony, Manning ignored this directive, walked slowly into\n\nthe  garage,  and closed  and  locked  the door  behind  him.\n\nLennon  testified  that  his  pursuit  of  Manning  into  the\n\nbuilding was delayed by the presence of Manning's rottweiler,\n\nwhich was  running around loose  in the driveway  area behind\n\nthe  house.  After eventually  gaining entrance to the garage\n\n(about three to five minutes later), Lennon  found and seized\n\nthe  brown briefcase.  He  did not, however,  find Manning in\n\nthe house.\n\n          Detective David Lussier  also testified  concerning\n\nthe identity of the driver of the Cherokee just  prior to the\n\nraid.  Lussier,  who also  had known Manning  for some  time,\n\ntestified that  he observed Manning, along  with a companion,\n\ndrive by  his surveillance  position (located about  50 yards\n\nfrom the house  in a parking lot which provided a direct view\n\ninto the rear  yard of 151 Doyle  Avenue) just three or  four\n\nminutes before the raid.   Indeed, Lussier testified that  he\n\nordered that the warrant  be executed at that  time precisely\n\nbecause  he  feared  that  eye contact  between  himself  and\n\nManning had caused his surveillance to be compromised.  After\n\nordering  the raid,  Lussier testified that  he drove  to the\n\nfront  of the house, entered  it through the  front door, and\n\nproceeded to  the basement, where  he found  a broken  window\n\nthrough which Manning apparently had escaped.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          In contrast to the detectives' testimony, both Sean\n\nDuncan  and Manning testified that  the driver of  the car at\n\nthe time of the raid was (as noted above) Troy McKenzie.  The\n\nsubstance of their testimony was that Duncan and Manning  had\n\nbeen riding around together throughout the day, that they had\n\npicked up McKenzie at  some point in the afternoon,  and that\n\nthey  thereafter   drove  to   the  residence   of  Manning's\n\ngirlfriend.  At this point, Manning gave  McKenzie and Duncan\n\n$40  and asked them to  take his rottweiler,  which was being\n\nkept  at his mother's house, to the veterinarian for a rabies\n\nshot.   McKenzie and Duncan  then drove the  Cherokee over to\n\nManning's  mother's  house  to  pick  up  the  dog.    Duncan\n\ntestified that McKenzie  entered the house  to fetch the  dog\n\nwhile he waited  in the  car.  Shortly  thereafter, the  raid\n\noccurred.   Duncan also testified  that he had  \"no idea\" was\n\nhappened to Troy McKenzie after he entered the house.\n\n          One week after the execution of the search warrant,\n\nManning voluntarily  turned himself  in to  the  police.   He\n\nsubsequently  was charged  with and  convicted of  the crimes\n\nnoted above, all of which necessitated a finding that Manning\n\nwas  the person  in  possession of  the  brown briefcase  who\n\ndisappeared into 151 Doyle Avenue at the time of the raid.\n\nB.  The Prosecutor's Comments\n                             \n\n          Manning complains  of four different  comments made\n\nby the prosecutor  during the course of his closing argument.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nFirst,   Manning  contends  that  the  prosecutor  improperly\n\nvouched for the credibility of certain  prosecution witnesses\n\nduring the following colloquy:\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:    If Lussier  is  going to\n          come in and lie to you he could have done\n          that  very,  very  easily.     There's  a\n          million little ways they could have given\n          it to  the Defendant.   But  they cannot.\n          The  prosecution witnesses  cannot engage\n          in that  kind of conduct.   They're bound\n          by the truth.\n\n          [DEFENSE  COUNSEL]:   I  object  to that,\n          your Honor.\n\n          THE COURT:  Overruled.\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:    They're  bound by  their\n          oath  and  limits of  honesty.   The last\n          thing you might ask yourselves ---\n\n          [DEFENSE  COUNSEL]:   I  object  to that,\n          again I have a motion.\n\n          THE COURT:  Overruled, motion denied.\n\n(Hereinafter \"First  Passage\").  The government concedes that\n\nthis  passage  contains   improper  witness-vouching  by  the\n\nprosecution.\n\n          Next, Manning argues that the prosecutor engaged in\n\nadditional  improper   witness-vouching  and  inappropriately\n\nimplied that  he had additional  incriminating evidence when,\n\nin  responding to a  defense argument concerning  the lack of\n\nprobative  fingerprint evidence  on  the items  in the  brown\n\nbriefcase, he stated:\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:  [W]hen we  get to this gun\n          and these bombs  and this dope  we've got\n          an eyewitness who knows the Defendant and\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          saw it all in  his hands.  So  it doesn't\n          matter whether there's a  print on it  or\n          not.   But they  looked anyways  and what\n          did that  BCI officer tell you?   He told\n          you that  there were some  partial prints\n          on those items but  nothing that was good\n          enough   to    use   for   identification\n          purposes.    Nothing that  has sufficient\n          points of comparison on  it for him to be\n          positive and we have  to be fair, we have\n          to be positive.  Prosecution ---\n\n          [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, Judge.\n\n          THE COURT:  Overruled.\n\n          [PROSECUTION]:   Prosecution  must always\n          be fair. . . .\n\n(Hereinafter \"Second Passage\").   The government acknowledges\n\nthat  this prosecutorial  argument  also  contained  improper\n\nwitness-vouching, but denies that it implied the existence of\n\nadditional  incriminating evidence.   Rather,  the government\n\ncontends that it was  an effort to suggest  \"that prosecution\n\nwitnesses had not created false evidence[.]\"\n\n          Third,   Manning   asserts   that  the   prosecutor\n\nimpermissibly appealed to the  jury's emotions when, near the\n\nconclusion of the prosecutor's initial  closing argument, the\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:   Twelve responsible people\n          will  deliberate  on  this  case.    Take\n          responsibility  for   yourselves.    Take\n          responsibility for your community.\n\n          [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.\n\n          THE COURT:   The jury's responsibility is\n          to  follow  the Court's  instructions and\n          find the facts.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n(Hereinafter \"Third Passage\").   The  government denies  that\n\nthisargumentconstituted animproperappealtothe jury'semotions.\n\n          Finally, Manning charges  that the prosecutor again\n\nimpermissibly  appealed  to   the  jury's  emotions   at  the\n\nconclusion of his rebuttal argument:\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:     Convict  the  Defendant\n          fairly  because  the  facts  and  the law\n          compel conviction.  Convict the Defendant\n          because justice compels conviction.\n\n          [DEFENSE  COUNSEL]:   I  object  to that,\n          too. . . .\n\n          THE COURT:   I direct the  jury to ignore\n          the last  statement of the  United States\n          Attorney.  Your responsibility, as I told\n          you  at  the beginning,  is  to determine\n          whether or not, in  light of the law that\n          is  given  to  you  by  the   Court,  the\n          government  has met its burden of proving\n          the Defendant guilty beyond  a reasonable\n          doubt. . . .\n\n(Hereinafter \"Fourth Passage\").   Although it is not entirely\n\nclear, the  government appears to concede  that this argument\n\nwas improper.   See  Government's Brief at  41 (acknowledging\n                   \n\nthat this argument \"is  somewhat similar to exhortations that\n\nhave been deemed impermissible\").\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Manning's  prosecutorial  misconduct  argument,  as\n\ndeveloped in his  brief and at oral  argument, proceeds along\n\nthe following lines.  First, Manning correctly notes that, in\n\norder to convict him of the  crimes with which he was charged\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nin  the  indictment, the  jury  was obliged,  as  a threshold\n                                                             \n\nmatter, to find that  he was the person who  disappeared into\n      \n\nthe  garage  at 151  Doyle  Avenue  while holding  the  brown\n\nsuitcase.     Next,   Manning  observes  that   this  finding\n\nnecessarily must have been  anchored upon determinations  (1)\n           \n\nthat Detectives Lennon and Lussier were credible witnesses on\n\nthis issue, and (2)  that he and  Duncan were not.   Finally,\n\nManning contends that the improper witness-vouching committed\n\nby  the prosecutor, which was allowed by the trial court over\n\nhis  objection,  both  alone  and  in  conjunction  with  the\n\nprosecutor's  implication  that   there  existed   additional\n\ninculpatory evidence and  the prosecutor's other inflammatory\n\nrhetoric,  so compromised  the jury's  ability to  make these\n\nessential and  liminal  credibility determinations  that  his\n\ntrial was  rendered fundamentally unfair.   We find Manning's\n\nreasoning to be persuasive.\n\n          We begin by laying the groundwork for our analysis.\n\nFirst, we  think that the  First and Second  Passages contain\n\nimproper  witness-vouching by  the prosecution.    See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States  v. Innamorati,  996 F.2d 456,  482 (1st  Cir.)\n                            \n\n(prosecutor may  not vouch  for government  witnesses), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 114  S. Ct.  409 and  114 S.  Ct. 459  (1993); United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Martin,  815 F.2d  818, 821-23  (1st Cir.),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 494 U.S. 825 (1987).  Next, we believe that the Third\n      \n\nand  Fourth Passages include improper  appeals to the jury to\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nact  in ways  other than  as a  dispassionate arbiter  of the\n\nfacts.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Young, 470  U.S. 1, 17\n                                            \n\n(1985) (prosecutor  erred in telling  jury to \"do  its job\");\n\nUnited  States v. Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1986)\n                            \n\n(prosecutor  erred in urging jury to \"do its duty\").  Finally\n\nwe  think it rather obvious  that, when read  in context, the\n\nprosecutor's comments  in the Second Passage  were an attempt\n\nto counter defense counsel's anticipated argument relating to\n\nthe lack of fingerprint evidence on the items seized from the\n\nbrown briefcase.   Insofar as the  comments were intended  to\n\nrelieve  the jury of  any misapprehension that  there were no\n                                                             \n\nfingerprints  on  these  items,   these  comments  were   not\n\nimproper.  Given that defense counsel had not suggested  that\n\nthe partial prints were not Manning's, cf. Young, 470 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n11-14 (discussing the  \"invited response\" doctrine), however,\n\nthe insinuation  that  the partial  prints were  inculpatory,\n\nwhich  we  believe  inhered  at  least  in  the  prosecutor's\n\nstatement that \"we have to be fair, we have to be  positive,\"\n\nwas impermissible.  See e.g., United  States v. Udechukwu, 11\n                                                         \n\nF.3d 1101,  1106 (1st  Cir. 1993) (prosecutor  may not  imply\n\nthat the  government has inculpatory information  that is not\n\nin  evidence); United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 683 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1993) (similar).1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Additionally,  we   note  that  the   improper  arguments\nchallenged on appeal  are by no means the  only inappropriate\ncomments  made to the jury  by the prosecution during closing\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          We also feel constrained to express our belief that\n\nthe government's  overreaching in this case  was not entirely\n\nlimited  to the  prosecutor's  conduct at  trial.   While  we\n\nacknowledge that the  government was forthright  in admitting\n\nthat   the  prosecutor  engaged   in  impermissible  witness-\n\nvouching, we are surprised at several of the  other positions\n\nstaked out in  the government's appellate  brief.  First,  we\n\nare  hard-pressed to  comprehend, let  alone agree  with, the\n\n                    \n\narguments.   By way of  illustration, we offer  the following\npassage  where  the  prosecutor  described his  view  of  the\n\"roles\" played  by the judge, jury,  and, especially, defense\ncounsel in a criminal trial:\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:   We all play roles in this\n          trial.  You have seen what the Judge does\n          and ruled on the law  [sic].  As a  jury,\n          you serve a role, a function in this case\n          too,  you  represent  the people  of  the\n          United States, the citizens of  the State\n          of  Rhode Island.   By  your verdict  you\n          will speak for  those citizens.   By your\n          verdict you will determine---\n\n          [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.\n\n          THE COURT:  Just a moment.  The jury will\n          make the decision among  themselves based\n          on  the  instructions  and  the  evidence\n          they've heard.\n\n          [PROSECUTOR]:  Yes, your honor.   You are\n          fact  finders and  in order  to find  the\n          facts one of the things you have to do is\n          to decide  which of  the facts  are true.\n          You will have  to assess the  credibility\n          of the  witnesses.  Some  prosecutors get\n          up  and say  that  the  role  of  defense\n          attorney  is to cloud  the issues or make\n          smoke   screens.     I   liken  them   to\n          Shakespeare's players, full of  sound and\n          fury signifying nothing . . . .\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ngovernment's characterization of the Second Passage, \"in full\n\ncontext,\" as an effort to suggest \"that prosecution witnesses\n\nhad not  created false evidence\"  (a claim the  defense never\n\nmade).   Instead, as noted above, we  think it plain (1) that\n\nthe   government   was   responding   to   defense  counsel's\n\nanticipated  argument  that  the  jury  should  consider  the\n\nabsence of probative fingerprint  evidence on the items found\n\nin  the brown briefcase to  be exculpatory, and  (2) that, in\n\nstating that the prosecution  \"ha[s] to be fair\" and  \"has to\n\nbe positive,\" the prosecutor went too far and hinted that the\n\npartial prints tended to inculpate Manning.\n\n          The   government's   references  to   extra-circuit\n\ncaselaw and strained attempt  to distinguish the inflammatory\n\nrhetoric  here from the cases cited by Manning also strike us\n\nas  inappropriate.   By  now, we  think  it should  be beyond\n\nquestion  that, in this circuit  at least, arguments urging a\n\njury  to  act in  any capacity  other  than as  the impartial\n\narbiter of the facts in the case before it are improper.  See\n                                                             \n\nMandelbaum, 803  F.2d at  44; cf. Arrieta-Agressot  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  3 F.3d  525,  529-30 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (inflammatory\n      \n\narguments distract  jury from the  only issue presented  in a\n                                       \n\ncase:    whether  the  evidence establishes  guilt  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt).\n\n          We turn now to  our analysis.  In this  circuit, we\n\nhave identified several  factors relevant to  a determination\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nof  whether  prosecutorial misconduct  has \"`so  poisoned the\n\nwell,'\" see United States v.

These  factors  guide  our\n      \n\nconclusion as  to whether the misconduct  likely affected the\n\ntrial's outcome.   E.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106; Arrieta-\n                                                             \n\nAgressot, 3 F.3d at 528.2\n        \n\n                    \n\n2.

As we  have previously  noted, however,  see\n                                                             \nSmith, 982 F.2d at 686 n.8; United States v.

Hasting,  461  U.S.  499,   506  (1983)  (use  of\n                   \nsupervisory   power   to   deter   prosecutorial   misconduct\ninappropriate where  error in case-at-bar was  harmless).  At\nany rate,  while we  fervently hope  that our decision  might\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          In this case,  we think that  all of these  factors\n\nmilitate  in   favor   of  reversal.      The   prosecutorial\n\noverreaching  that  took  place  here,  while  certainly  not\n\nconscience-shocking,  was pervasive.   Moveover,  it occurred\n\nduring closing arguments -- the last words spoken to the jury\n\nby  the  trial attorneys  -- and  in no  way was  provoked by\n\nimproper  arguments of  defense counsel.   Cf.,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Machor, 879 F.2d  945, 956 (1st  Cir. 1989), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990) and 493 U.S. 1094 (1990).\n                                \n\n          More  importantly,  the  district  court  not  only\n\nfailed to give curative  instructions to counter the improper\n\nFirst and Second Passages, but it also tacitly indicated that\n\nthe  arguments in  these Passages  were proper  by overruling\n\ndefense counsel's contemporaneous objections  to them.3  As a\n\nresult, we  think  it  likely  that the  jury  inferred  that\n\nDetectives  Lennon  and  Lussier,  as  both  law  enforcement\n\nofficials  and  prosecution  witnesses,  could   properly  be\n                                              \n\nconsidered as  having a heightened duty  to testify honestly.\n\n                    \n\nhave the  effect of deterring prosecutors  from straying into\nforbidden territory in the  future, we emphasize that today's\nresult is in no way informed by a deterrent animus.\n\n3.  With  regard  to the  Third  and  Fourth Passages,  while\nfailing  to  tell  the  jury to  disregard  the  prosecutor's\ncomments,  the district  judge did remind  the jury  that its\n                                  \nresponsibility  was to  find the  facts.   Thus, we  think it\nunlikely  that   a  significant   amount  of  prejudice   was\nengendered  by the inflammatory  rhetoric in  those Passages.\nAccordingly, we  restrict our analysis to  the likely effects\nof  the  witness- vouching  and  hints  at  the existence  of\nadditional inculpatory evidence in First and Second Passages.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nOf course, such an inference undermines the impartiality with\n\nwhich   the   jury   is   supposed   to    make   credibility\n\ndeterminations.4  Moreover, as we  have stated, we think that\n\nthe jury could have inferred from the \"we have to be fair, we\n\nhave to  be positive\" comments that  the partial fingerprints\n\non the items in the brown briefcase were Manning's.\n\n          This leads  to our final and  most important point.\n\nWhile there may have been abundant evidence in this case that\n\nManning  was a  drug dealer  and that the  drug paraphernalia\n\nseized at 151  Doyle Avenue  was Manning's,  the question  of\n\nwhether  Manning  committed  the  crimes with  which  he  was\n\ncharged in the indictment (i.e., possession of the contraband\n                         \n\nitems  seized from  the brown  briefcase) turned  entirely on\n                                                          \n\nwhether,  with regard to the  issue of who  carried the brown\n\nbriefcase into 151 Doyle Avenue, the jury believed Detectives\n\nLennon and Lussier or whether it believed Manning and Duncan.\n\nIn our view, each  of the witnesses gave a  plausible account\n\non this threshold question;  that is to say, neither  version\n\nof who was carrying the briefcase  was inherently unlikely to\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n4.  In  so  stating,  we  obviously are  unconvinced  by  the\ngovernment's argument that  the district court's  admonition,\nin its final instructions, that \"the United States Government\nstands no higher before this  Court than does Defendant\"  was\nsufficient to cure both the witness-vouching in the First and\nSecond Passages and the  effect of the court's overruling  of\ndefense  counsel's contemporaneous objections.   Indeed, this\ninstruction,  referring  as it  does  to  \"the United  States\nGovernment,\"  in no  way rebuts  the above-noted  implication\nthat  Detectives Lennon  and  Lussier, as  Providence  police\n                                                     \nofficers, had a heightened duty to testify honestly.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nbe true.  Given this, and given the further fact  that we are\n\nprecluded from making independent  credibility determinations\n\non appeal, see United States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 83 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 114  S.  Ct. 147  (1993), the  question\n                    \n\nbefore us  really is whether the  prosecutorial misconduct in\n\nthe  First and  Second  Passages (which,  as we  have stated,\n\nsignificantly interfered  with the jury's ability  to make an\n\nessential  and liminal credibility  determination) was likely\n\nto have  affected the trial's outcome,  see, e.g., Udechukwu,\n                                                            \n\n11 F.3d  at 1106; Arrieta-Agressot,  3 F.3d at  528.  We  are\n                                  \n\ncompelled  to conclude that this question must be answered in\n\nthe affirmative.   Accordingly, Manning is entitled  to a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          Nearly sixty years ago, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n               The  United  States Attorney  is the\n          representative not of  an ordinary  party\n          to  a controversy,  but of  a sovereignty\n          whose obligation to govern impartially is\n          as compelling as its obligation to govern\n          at all; and whose interest, therefore, in\n          a criminal  prosecution  is not  that  it\n          shall win a case, but that justice  shall\n          be done.   As such,  he is in  a peculiar\n          and  very definite  sense the  servant of\n          the law, the twofold aim of which is that\n          guilt  shall  not  escape   or  innocence\n          suffer.      He   may    prosecute   with\n          earnestness  and  vigor  --   indeed,  he\n          should do  so.  But, while  he may strike\n          hard  blows,  he  is not  at  liberty  to\n          strike foul ones.  It is as much his duty\n          to   refrain    from   improper   methods\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n          calculated   to    produce   a   wrongful\n          conviction   as  it   is  to   use  every\n          legitimate  means to  bring about  a just\n          one.\n\nBerger  v.

Manning's principal appellate claim is that improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments undermined the fairness of his trial.  After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the prosecutor's comments did so infect the proceedings below that Manning is entitled to a new trial.  Accordingly, confining our discussion and analysis to the prosecutorial misconduct issue, we vacate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. Relevant Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that late in the afternoon on October 7, 1991, several members of the Providence Police Department executed a search warrant at Manning's mother's house, located at 151 Doyle Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island.  In the course of their search, the police officers seized, inter alia, a brown briefcase which contained the material that formed the basis of the charges in the indictment:  two bags of cocaine weighing 124.64 grams, various drug paraphernalia, a loaded .9 millimeter handgun, and six copper pipe bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also is undisputed that just prior to the raid, two men drove up to Manning's mother's house in Manning's red Jeep Cherokee.  The man in the passenger seat was one Sean Duncan, who was detained by the police but never charged in connection with this case.  The vehicle's driver, however, was not apprehended at the scene.  The identity of the driver was (and is) perhaps the most hotly contested issue in this case, as it was (and is) the government's theory that the driver brought the brown briefcase into the house.  The government argued successfully that the driver was Manning;  Manning and Duncan testified that the driver was one Troy McKenzie.  The primary government witness on the issue of the driver's identity was Detective Joseph Lennon, a member of the search team that day.  Lennon testified that, after having been given the order to execute the search warrant, he approached the rear of 151 Doyle Avenue, where he saw Manning, whom he knew and with whom he had conversed on other occasions, standing outside the Cherokee and in front of the house's garage.  Lennon testified that Manning was holding the brown briefcase.  Lennon also testified to seeing Duncan seated in the passenger seat of the Cherokee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lennon further testified that, upon seeing Manning, he identified himself as a police officer and, with gun drawn, ordered Manning to stop.  According to Lennon's testimony, Manning ignored this directive, walked slowly into the garage, and closed and locked the door behind him.  Lennon testified that his pursuit of Manning into the building was delayed by the presence of Manning's rottweiler, which was running around loose in the driveway area behind the house.  After eventually gaining entrance to the garage (about three to five minutes later), Lennon found and seized the brown briefcase.  He did not, however, find Manning in the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective David Lussier also testified concerning the identity of the driver of the Cherokee just prior to the raid.  Lussier, who also had known Manning for some time, testified that he observed Manning, along with a companion, drive by his surveillance position (located about 50 yards from the house in a parking lot which provided a direct view into the rear yard of 151 Doyle Avenue) just three or four minutes before the raid.  Indeed, Lussier testified that he ordered that the warrant be executed at that time precisely because he feared that eye contact between himself and Manning had caused his surveillance to be compromised.  After ordering the raid, Lussier testified that he drove to the front of the house, entered it through the front door, and proceeded to the basement, where he found a broken window through which Manning apparently had escaped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the detectives' testimony, both Sean Duncan and Manning testified that the driver of the car at the time of the raid was (as noted above) Troy McKenzie.  The substance of their testimony was that Duncan and Manning had been riding around together throughout the day, that they had picked up McKenzie at some point in the afternoon, and that they thereafter drove to the residence of Manning's girlfriend.  At this point, Manning gave McKenzie and Duncan $40 and asked them to take his rottweiler, which was being kept at his mother's house, to the veterinarian for a rabies shot.  McKenzie and Duncan then drove the Cherokee over to Manning's mother's house to pick up the dog.  Duncan testified that McKenzie entered the house to fetch the dog while he waited in the car.  Shortly thereafter, the raid occurred.  Duncan also testified that he had \"no idea\" was happened to Troy McKenzie after he entered the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One week after the execution of the search warrant, Manning voluntarily turned himself in to the police.  He subsequently was charged with and convicted of the crimes noted above, all of which necessitated a finding that Manning was the person in possession of the brown briefcase who disappeared into 151 Doyle Avenue at the time of the raid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Prosecutor's Comments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning complains of four different comments made by the prosecutor during the course of his closing argument.  First, Manning contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of certain prosecution witnesses during the following colloquy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  If Lussier is going to come in and lie to you he could have done that very, very easily.  There's a million little ways they could have given it to the Defendant.  But they cannot.  The prosecution witnesses cannot engage in that kind of conduct.  They're bound by the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  They're bound by their oath and limits of honesty.  The last thing you might ask yourselves--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, again I have a motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled, motion denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"First Passage\").  The government concedes that this passage contains improper witness-vouching by the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Manning argues that the prosecutor engaged in additional improper witness-vouching and inappropriately implied that he had additional incriminating evidence when, in responding to a defense argument concerning the lack of probative fingerprint evidence on the items in the brown briefcase, he stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  [W]hen we get to this gun and these bombs and this dope we've got an eyewitness who knows the Defendant and saw it all in his hands.  So it doesn't matter whether there's a print on it or not.  But they looked anyways and what did that BCI officer tell you?   He told you that there were some partial prints on those items but nothing that was good enough to use for identification purposes.  Nothing that has sufficient points of comparison on it for him to be positive and we have to be fair, we have to be positive.  Prosecution--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTION]:  Prosecution must always be fair....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Second Passage\").  The government acknowledges that this prosecutorial argument also contained improper witness-vouching, but denies that it implied the existence of additional incriminating evidence.  Rather, the government contends that it was an effort to suggest \"that prosecution witnesses had not created false evidence[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Manning asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly appealed to the jury's emotions when, near the conclusion of the prosecutor's initial closing argument, the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Twelve responsible people will deliberate on this case.  Take responsibility for yourselves.  Take responsibility for your community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  The jury's responsibility is to follow the Court's instructions and find the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Third Passage\").  The government denies that this argument constituted an improper appeal to the jury's emotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Manning charges that the prosecutor again impermissibly appealed to the jury's emotions at the conclusion of his rebuttal argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Convict the Defendant fairly because the facts and the law compel conviction.  Convict the Defendant because justice compels conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, too....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I direct the jury to ignore the last statement of the United States Attorney.  Your responsibility, as I told you at the beginning, is to determine whether or not, in light of the law that is given to you by the Court, the government has met its burden of proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Fourth Passage\").  Although it is not entirely clear, the government appears to concede that this argument was improper.  See Government's Brief at 41 (acknowledging that this argument \"is somewhat similar to exhortations that have been deemed impermissible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning's prosecutorial misconduct argument, as developed in his brief and at oral argument, proceeds along the following lines.  First, Manning correctly notes that, in order to convict him of the crimes with which he was charged in the indictment, the jury was obliged, as a threshold matter, to find that he was the person who disappeared into the garage at 151 Doyle Avenue while holding the brown suitcase.  Next, Manning observes that this finding necessarily must have been anchored upon determinations (1) that Detectives Lennon and Lussier were credible witnesses on this issue, and (2) that he and Duncan were not.  Finally, Manning contends that the improper witness-vouching committed by the prosecutor, which was allowed by the trial court over his objection, both alone and in conjunction with the prosecutor's implication that there existed additional inculpatory evidence and the prosecutor's other inflammatory rhetoric, so compromised the jury's ability to make these essential and liminal credibility determinations that his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair.  We find Manning's reasoning to be persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by laying the groundwork for our analysis.  First, we think that the First and Second Passages contain improper witness-vouching by the prosecution.  See, e.g., United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 482 (1st Cir.)  (prosecutor may not vouch for government witnesses), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 and --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 459, 126 L.Ed.2d 391 (1993);  United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 821-23 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 825, 108 S.Ct. 89, 98 L.Ed.2d 51 (1987).  Next, we believe that the Third and Fourth Passages include improper appeals to the jury to act in ways other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts.  See, e.g., United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 17, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (prosecutor erred in telling jury to \"do its job\");  United States v. Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir.1986) (prosecutor erred in urging jury to \"do its duty\").  Finally we think it rather obvious that, when read in context, the prosecutor's comments in the Second Passage were an attempt to counter defense counsel's anticipated argument relating to the lack of fingerprint evidence on the items seized from the brown briefcase.  Insofar as the comments were intended to relieve the jury of any misapprehension that there were no fingerprints on these items, these comments were not improper.  Given that defense counsel had not suggested that the partial prints were not Manning's, cf. Young, 470 U.S. at 11-14, 105 S.Ct. at 1044-46 (discussing the \"invited response\" doctrine), however, the insinuation that the partial prints were inculpatory, which we believe inhered at least in the prosecutor's statement that \"we have to be fair, we have to be positive,\" was impermissible.  See e.g., United States v. Udechukwu, 11 F.3d 1101, 1106 (1st Cir.1993) (prosecutor may not imply that the government has inculpatory information that is not in evidence);  United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 683 (1st Cir.1993) (similar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also feel constrained to express our belief that the government's overreaching in this case was not entirely limited to the prosecutor's conduct at trial.  While we acknowledge that the government was forthright in admitting that the prosecutor engaged in impermissible witness-vouching, we are surprised at several of the other positions staked out in the government's appellate brief.  First, we are hard-pressed to comprehend, let alone agree with, the government's characterization of the Second Passage, \"in full context,\" as an effort to suggest \"that prosecution witnesses had not created false evidence\" (a claim the defense never made).  Instead, as noted above, we think it plain (1) that the government was responding to defense counsel's anticipated argument that the jury should consider the absence of probative fingerprint evidence on the items found in the brown briefcase to be exculpatory, and (2) that, in stating that the prosecution \"ha[s] to be fair\" and \"has to be positive,\" the prosecutor went too far and hinted that the partial prints tended to inculpate Manning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's references to extra-circuit caselaw and strained attempt to distinguish the inflammatory rhetoric here from the cases cited by Manning also strike us as inappropriate.  By now, we think it should be beyond question that, in this circuit at least, arguments urging a jury to act in any capacity other than as the impartial arbiter of the facts in the case before it are improper.  See Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d at 44;  cf. Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 529-30 (1st Cir.1993) (inflammatory arguments distract jury from the only issue presented in a case:  whether the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to our analysis.  In this circuit, we have identified several factors relevant to a determination of whether prosecutorial misconduct has \" 'so poisoned the well,' \" see United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 586-87 (1st Cir.1982)), that a new trial is required.  Although we have used slightly varying terminology in describing these factors, the common denominators are (1) the severity of the misconduct;  (2) the context in which it occurred;  (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions;  and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.  See, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528-30;  Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d at 610;  United States v. Quesada-Bonilla, 952 F.2d 597, 601-02 (1st Cir.1991);  Capone, 683 F.2d at 585-86.   These factors guide our conclusion as to whether the misconduct likely affected the trial's outcome.  E.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we think that all of these factors militate in favor of reversal.  The prosecutorial overreaching that took place here, while certainly not conscience-shocking, was pervasive.  Moveover, it occurred during closing arguments--the last words spoken to the jury by the trial attorneys--and in no way was provoked by improper arguments of defense counsel.  Cf., e.g., United States v. Machor, 879 F.2d 945, 956 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1081, 110 S.Ct. 1138, 107 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1990) and 493 U.S. 1094, 110 S.Ct. 1167, 107 L.Ed.2d 1070 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the district court not only failed to give curative instructions to counter the improper First and Second Passages, but it also tacitly indicated that the arguments in these Passages were proper by overruling defense counsel's contemporaneous objections to them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result, we think it likely that the jury inferred that Detectives Lennon and Lussier, as both law enforcement officials and prosecution witnesses, could properly be considered as having a heightened duty to testify honestly.  Of course, such an inference undermines the impartiality with which the jury is supposed to make credibility determinations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, as we have stated, we think that the jury could have inferred from the \"we have to be fair, we have to be positive\" comments that the partial fingerprints on the items in the brown briefcase were Manning's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to our final and most important point.  While there may have been abundant evidence in this case that Manning was a drug dealer and that the drug paraphernalia seized at 151 Doyle Avenue was Manning's, the question of whether Manning committed the crimes with which he was charged in the indictment (i.e., possession of the contraband items seized from the brown briefcase) turned entirely on whether, with regard to the issue of who carried the brown briefcase into 151 Doyle Avenue, the jury believed Detectives Lennon and Lussier or whether it believed Manning and Duncan.  In our view, each of the witnesses gave a plausible account on this threshold question;  that is to say, neither version of who was carrying the briefcase was inherently unlikely to be true.  Given this, and given the further fact that we are precluded from making independent credibility determinations on appeal, see United States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 83 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 147, 126 L.Ed.2d 109 (1993), the question before us really is whether the prosecutorial misconduct in the First and Second Passages (which, as we have stated, significantly interfered with the jury's ability to make an essential and liminal credibility determination) was likely to have affected the trial's outcome, see, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.   We are compelled to conclude that this question must be answered in the affirmative.  Accordingly, Manning is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly sixty years ago, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all;  and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.  As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.  He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so.  But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.  It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).  For the third time in the last six months, we find ourselves in the regrettable position of vacating a conviction because a United States Attorney has failed to honor sufficiently these precepts.  See Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 530;  see also United States v. Moreno, 991 F.2d 943, 949-50 (1st Cir.)  (Torruella, J., dissenting) (arguing, inter alia, that the prosecutorial misconduct in that case warranted reversal of defendant's conviction), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 457, 126 L.Ed.2d 389 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Additionally, we note that the improper arguments challenged on appeal are by no means the only inappropriate comments made to the jury by the prosecution during closing arguments.  By way of illustration, we offer the following passage where the prosecutor described his view of the \"roles\" played by the judge, jury, and, especially, defense counsel in a criminal trial:</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  We all play roles in this trial.  You have seen what the Judge does and ruled on the law [sic].  As a jury, you serve a role, a function in this case too, you represent the people of the United States, the citizens of the State of Rhode Island.  By your verdict you will speak for those citizens.  By your verdict you will determine--</p>\n        <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  Just a moment.  The jury will make the decision among themselves based on the instructions and the evidence they've heard.</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Yes, your honor.  You are fact finders and in order to find the facts one of the things you have to do is to decide which of the facts are true.  You will have to assess the credibility of the witnesses.  Some prosecutors get up and say that the role of defense attorney is to cloud the issues or make smoke screens.  I liken them to Shakespeare's players, full of sound and fury signifying nothing....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This line of authority, which derives from Capone, also often speaks of the need to deter future prosecutorial misconduct, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Quesada-Bonilla, 952 F.2d at 602;  United States v. Brown, 938 F.2d 1482, 1489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 611, 116 L.Ed.2d 633 (1991), Capone, 683 F.2d at 586, as an additional legitimate basis for reversal.  As we have previously noted, however, see Smith, 982 F.2d at 686 n. 8;  United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 763 (1st Cir.1991), and as the government argues here, our power to act solely on this basis has, at the least, been significantly circumscribed by the Supreme Court, see United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 506, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1979, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (use of supervisory power to deter prosecutorial misconduct inappropriate where error in case-at-bar was harmless).  At any rate, while we fervently hope that our decision might have the effect of deterring prosecutors from straying into forbidden territory in the future, we emphasize that today's result is in no way informed by a deterrent animus</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With regard to the Third and Fourth Passages, while failing to tell the jury to disregard the prosecutor's comments, the district judge did remind the jury that its responsibility was to find the facts.  Thus, we think it unlikely that a significant amount of prejudice was engendered by the inflammatory rhetoric in those Passages.  Accordingly, we restrict our analysis to the likely effects of the witness-vouching and hints at the existence of additional inculpatory evidence in First and Second Passages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In so stating, we obviously are unconvinced by the government's argument that the district court's admonition, in its final instructions, that \"the United States Government stands no higher before this Court than does Defendant\" was sufficient to cure both the witness-vouching in the First and Second Passages and the effect of the court's overruling of defense counsel's contemporaneous objections.  Indeed, this instruction, referring as it does to \"the United States Government,\" in no way rebuts the above-noted implication that Detectives Lennon and Lussier, as Providence police officers, had a heightened duty to testify honestly</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Manning's principal appellate claim is that improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments undermined the fairness of his trial.  After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the prosecutor's comments did so infect the proceedings below that Manning is entitled to a new trial.  Accordingly, confining our discussion and analysis to the prosecutorial misconduct issue, we vacate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. Relevant Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that late in the afternoon on October 7, 1991, several members of the Providence Police Department executed a search warrant at Manning's mother's house, located at 151 Doyle Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island.  In the course of their search, the police officers seized, inter alia, a brown briefcase which contained the material that formed the basis of the charges in the indictment:  two bags of cocaine weighing 124.64 grams, various drug paraphernalia, a loaded .9 millimeter handgun, and six copper pipe bombs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also is undisputed that just prior to the raid, two men drove up to Manning's mother's house in Manning's red Jeep Cherokee.  The man in the passenger seat was one Sean Duncan, who was detained by the police but never charged in connection with this case.  The vehicle's driver, however, was not apprehended at the scene.  The identity of the driver was (and is) perhaps the most hotly contested issue in this case, as it was (and is) the government's theory that the driver brought the brown briefcase into the house.  The government argued successfully that the driver was Manning;  Manning and Duncan testified that the driver was one Troy McKenzie.  The primary government witness on the issue of the driver's identity was Detective Joseph Lennon, a member of the search team that day.  Lennon testified that, after having been given the order to execute the search warrant, he approached the rear of 151 Doyle Avenue, where he saw Manning, whom he knew and with whom he had conversed on other occasions, standing outside the Cherokee and in front of the house's garage.  Lennon testified that Manning was holding the brown briefcase.  Lennon also testified to seeing Duncan seated in the passenger seat of the Cherokee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lennon further testified that, upon seeing Manning, he identified himself as a police officer and, with gun drawn, ordered Manning to stop.  According to Lennon's testimony, Manning ignored this directive, walked slowly into the garage, and closed and locked the door behind him.  Lennon testified that his pursuit of Manning into the building was delayed by the presence of Manning's rottweiler, which was running around loose in the driveway area behind the house.  After eventually gaining entrance to the garage (about three to five minutes later), Lennon found and seized the brown briefcase.  He did not, however, find Manning in the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective David Lussier also testified concerning the identity of the driver of the Cherokee just prior to the raid.  Lussier, who also had known Manning for some time, testified that he observed Manning, along with a companion, drive by his surveillance position (located about 50 yards from the house in a parking lot which provided a direct view into the rear yard of 151 Doyle Avenue) just three or four minutes before the raid.  Indeed, Lussier testified that he ordered that the warrant be executed at that time precisely because he feared that eye contact between himself and Manning had caused his surveillance to be compromised.  After ordering the raid, Lussier testified that he drove to the front of the house, entered it through the front door, and proceeded to the basement, where he found a broken window through which Manning apparently had escaped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the detectives' testimony, both Sean Duncan and Manning testified that the driver of the car at the time of the raid was (as noted above) Troy McKenzie.  The substance of their testimony was that Duncan and Manning had been riding around together throughout the day, that they had picked up McKenzie at some point in the afternoon, and that they thereafter drove to the residence of Manning's girlfriend.  At this point, Manning gave McKenzie and Duncan $40 and asked them to take his rottweiler, which was being kept at his mother's house, to the veterinarian for a rabies shot.  McKenzie and Duncan then drove the Cherokee over to Manning's mother's house to pick up the dog.  Duncan testified that McKenzie entered the house to fetch the dog while he waited in the car.  Shortly thereafter, the raid occurred.  Duncan also testified that he had \"no idea\" was happened to Troy McKenzie after he entered the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One week after the execution of the search warrant, Manning voluntarily turned himself in to the police.  He subsequently was charged with and convicted of the crimes noted above, all of which necessitated a finding that Manning was the person in possession of the brown briefcase who disappeared into 151 Doyle Avenue at the time of the raid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Prosecutor's Comments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning complains of four different comments made by the prosecutor during the course of his closing argument.  First, Manning contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of certain prosecution witnesses during the following colloquy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  If Lussier is going to come in and lie to you he could have done that very, very easily.  There's a million little ways they could have given it to the Defendant.  But they cannot.  The prosecution witnesses cannot engage in that kind of conduct.  They're bound by the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  They're bound by their oath and limits of honesty.  The last thing you might ask yourselves--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, again I have a motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled, motion denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"First Passage\").  The government concedes that this passage contains improper witness-vouching by the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Manning argues that the prosecutor engaged in additional improper witness-vouching and inappropriately implied that he had additional incriminating evidence when, in responding to a defense argument concerning the lack of probative fingerprint evidence on the items in the brown briefcase, he stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  [W]hen we get to this gun and these bombs and this dope we've got an eyewitness who knows the Defendant and saw it all in his hands.  So it doesn't matter whether there's a print on it or not.  But they looked anyways and what did that BCI officer tell you?   He told you that there were some partial prints on those items but nothing that was good enough to use for identification purposes.  Nothing that has sufficient points of comparison on it for him to be positive and we have to be fair, we have to be positive.  Prosecution--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTION]:  Prosecution must always be fair....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Second Passage\").  The government acknowledges that this prosecutorial argument also contained improper witness-vouching, but denies that it implied the existence of additional incriminating evidence.  Rather, the government contends that it was an effort to suggest \"that prosecution witnesses had not created false evidence[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Manning asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly appealed to the jury's emotions when, near the conclusion of the prosecutor's initial closing argument, the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Twelve responsible people will deliberate on this case.  Take responsibility for yourselves.  Take responsibility for your community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  The jury's responsibility is to follow the Court's instructions and find the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Third Passage\").  The government denies that this argument constituted an improper appeal to the jury's emotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Manning charges that the prosecutor again impermissibly appealed to the jury's emotions at the conclusion of his rebuttal argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Convict the Defendant fairly because the facts and the law compel conviction.  Convict the Defendant because justice compels conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that, too....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I direct the jury to ignore the last statement of the United States Attorney.  Your responsibility, as I told you at the beginning, is to determine whether or not, in light of the law that is given to you by the Court, the government has met its burden of proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Hereinafter \"Fourth Passage\").  Although it is not entirely clear, the government appears to concede that this argument was improper.  See Government's Brief at 41 (acknowledging that this argument \"is somewhat similar to exhortations that have been deemed impermissible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning's prosecutorial misconduct argument, as developed in his brief and at oral argument, proceeds along the following lines.  First, Manning correctly notes that, in order to convict him of the crimes with which he was charged in the indictment, the jury was obliged, as a threshold matter, to find that he was the person who disappeared into the garage at 151 Doyle Avenue while holding the brown suitcase.  Next, Manning observes that this finding necessarily must have been anchored upon determinations (1) that Detectives Lennon and Lussier were credible witnesses on this issue, and (2) that he and Duncan were not.  Finally, Manning contends that the improper witness-vouching committed by the prosecutor, which was allowed by the trial court over his objection, both alone and in conjunction with the prosecutor's implication that there existed additional inculpatory evidence and the prosecutor's other inflammatory rhetoric, so compromised the jury's ability to make these essential and liminal credibility determinations that his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair.  We find Manning's reasoning to be persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by laying the groundwork for our analysis.  First, we think that the First and Second Passages contain improper witness-vouching by the prosecution.  See, e.g., United States v. Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 482 (1st Cir.)

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span> (1993);  United States v. Martin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486369\"><a href=\"/opinion/486369/united-states-v-william-martin-united-states-of-america-v-james-rekrut/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>, 821-23 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span> (1987).  Next, we believe that the Third and Fourth Passages include improper appeals to the jury to act in ways other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts.  See, e.g., United States v. Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span>, 1047, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1985) (prosecutor erred in telling jury to \"do its job\");  United States v. Mandelbaum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477965\"><a href=\"/opinion/477965/united-states-v-bridget-m-mandelbaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1986) (prosecutor erred in urging jury to \"do its duty\").  Finally we think it rather obvious that, when read in context, the prosecutor's comments in the Second Passage were an attempt to counter defense counsel's anticipated argument relating to the lack of fingerprint evidence on the items seized from the brown briefcase.  Insofar as the comments were intended to relieve the jury of any misapprehension that there were no fingerprints on these items, these comments were not improper.  Given that defense counsel had not suggested that the partial prints were not Manning's, cf. Young, 470 U.S. at 11-14, 105 S.Ct. at 1044-46 (discussing the \"invited response\" doctrine), however, the insinuation that the partial prints were inculpatory, which we believe inhered at least in the prosecutor's statement that \"we have to be fair, we have to be positive,\" was impermissible.  See e.g., United States v. Udechukwu, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195102\"><a href=\"/opinion/195102/united-states-v-udechukwu/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></a></span>, 1106 (1st Cir.1993) (prosecutor may not imply that the government has inculpatory information that is not in evidence);  United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597416\"><a href=\"/opinion/597416/united-states-v-joseph-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 683 (1st Cir.1993) (similar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also feel constrained to express our belief that the government's overreaching in this case was not entirely limited to the prosecutor's conduct at trial.  While we acknowledge that the government was forthright in admitting that the prosecutor engaged in impermissible witness-vouching, we are surprised at several of the other positions staked out in the government's appellate brief.  First, we are hard-pressed to comprehend, let alone agree with, the government's characterization of the Second Passage, \"in full context,\" as an effort to suggest \"that prosecution witnesses had not created false evidence\" (a claim the defense never made).  Instead, as noted above, we think it plain (1) that the government was responding to defense counsel's anticipated argument that the jury should consider the absence of probative fingerprint evidence on the items found in the brown briefcase to be exculpatory, and (2) that, in stating that the prosecution \"ha[s] to be fair\" and \"has to be positive,\" the prosecutor went too far and hinted that the partial prints tended to inculpate Manning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's references to extra-circuit caselaw and strained attempt to distinguish the inflammatory rhetoric here from the cases cited by Manning also strike us as inappropriate.  By now, we think it should be beyond question that, in this circuit at least, arguments urging a jury to act in any capacity other than as the impartial arbiter of the facts in the case before it are improper.  See Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d at 44;  cf. Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 529-30 (1st Cir.1993) (inflammatory arguments distract jury from the only issue presented in a case:  whether the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to our analysis.  In this circuit, we have identified several factors relevant to a determination of whether prosecutorial misconduct has \" 'so poisoned the well,' \" see United States v. Hodge-Balwing, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574885\"><a href=\"/opinion/574885/united-states-v-saver-hodge-balwing-aka-balwin-hodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 610 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Capone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406407\"><a href=\"/opinion/406407/united-states-v-joseph-capone-united-states-of-america-v-richard-murnane/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 586-87 (1st Cir.1982)), that a new trial is required.  Although we have used slightly varying terminology in describing these factors, the common denominators are (1) the severity of the misconduct;  (2) the context in which it occurred;  (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions;  and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.  See, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528-30;  Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d at 610;  United States v. Quesada-Bonilla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574883\"><a href=\"/opinion/574883/united-states-v-eric-j-quesada-bonilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 601-02 (1st Cir.1991);  Capone, 683 F.2d at 585-86.   These factors guide our conclusion as to whether the misconduct likely affected the trial's outcome.  E.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we think that all of these factors militate in favor of reversal.  The prosecutorial overreaching that took place here, while certainly not conscience-shocking, was pervasive.  Moveover, it occurred during closing arguments--the last words spoken to the jury by the trial attorneys--and in no way was provoked by improper arguments of defense counsel.  Cf., e.g., United States v. Machor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526435\"><a href=\"/opinion/526435/united-states-v-winston-machor-united-states-of-america-v-armand-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Of course, such an inference undermines the impartiality with which the jury is supposed to make credibility determinations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, as we have stated, we think that the jury could have inferred from the \"we have to be fair, we have to be positive\" comments that the partial fingerprints on the items in the brown briefcase were Manning's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to our final and most important point.  While there may have been abundant evidence in this case that Manning was a drug dealer and that the drug paraphernalia seized at 151 Doyle Avenue was Manning's, the question of whether Manning committed the crimes with which he was charged in the indictment (i.e., possession of the contraband items seized from the brown briefcase) turned entirely on whether, with regard to the issue of who carried the brown briefcase into 151 Doyle Avenue, the jury believed Detectives Lennon and Lussier or whether it believed Manning and Duncan.  In our view, each of the witnesses gave a plausible account on this threshold question;  that is to say, neither version of who was carrying the briefcase was inherently unlikely to be true.  Given this, and given the further fact that we are precluded from making independent credibility determinations on appeal, see United States v. Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601487\"><a href=\"/opinion/601487/united-states-v-victor-manuel-alvarez-united-states-v-diana-matos/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span> (1993), the question before us really is whether the prosecutorial misconduct in the First and Second Passages (which, as we have stated, significantly interfered with the jury's ability to make an essential and liminal credibility determination) was likely to have affected the trial's outcome, see, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528.   We are compelled to conclude that this question must be answered in the affirmative.  Accordingly, Manning is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly sixty years ago, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all;  and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.  As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.  He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so.  But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.  It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berger v.

For the third time in the last six months, we find ourselves in the regrettable position of vacating a conviction because a United States Attorney has failed to honor sufficiently these precepts.  See Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 530;  see also United States v. Moreno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605530\"><a href=\"/opinion/605530/united-states-v-raymond-moreno-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span>, 949-50 (1st Cir.)

By way of illustration, we offer the following passage where the prosecutor described his view of the \"roles\" played by the judge, jury, and, especially, defense counsel in a criminal trial:</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  We all play roles in this trial.  You have seen what the Judge does and ruled on the law [sic].  As a jury, you serve a role, a function in this case too, you represent the people of the United States, the citizens of the State of Rhode Island.  By your verdict you will speak for those citizens.  By your verdict you will determine--</p>\n        <p>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  I object to that.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  Just a moment.  The jury will make the decision among themselves based on the instructions and the evidence they've heard.</p>\n        <p>[PROSECUTOR]:  Yes, your honor.  You are fact finders and in order to find the facts one of the things you have to do is to decide which of the facts are true.  You will have to assess the credibility of the witnesses.  Some prosecutors get up and say that the role of defense attorney is to cloud the issues or make smoke screens.  I liken them to Shakespeare's players, full of sound and fury signifying nothing....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This line of authority, which derives from Capone, also often speaks of the need to deter future prosecutorial misconduct, e.g., Udechukwu, 11 F.3d at 1106;  Quesada-Bonilla, 952 F.2d at 602;  United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564957\"><a href=\"/opinion/564957/united-states-v-kenneth-michael-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1482</span></a></span>, 1489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></span> (1991), Capone, 683 F.2d at 586, as an additional legitimate basis for reversal.  As we have previously noted, however, see Smith, 982 F.2d at 686 n. 8;  United States v. Osorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558564\"><a href=\"/opinion/558564/united-states-v-lorenzo-osorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 763 (1st Cir.1991), and as the government argues here, our power to act solely on this basis has, at the least, been significantly circumscribed by the Supreme Court, see United States v. Hasting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 506, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At any rate, while we fervently hope that our decision might have the effect of deterring prosecutors from straying into forbidden territory in the future, we emphasize that today's result is in no way informed by a deterrent animus</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With regard to the Third and Fourth Passages, while failing to tell the jury to disregard the prosecutor's comments, the district judge did remind the jury that its responsibility was to find the facts.  Thus, we think it unlikely that a significant amount of prejudice was engendered by the inflammatory rhetoric in those Passages.  Accordingly, we restrict our analysis to the likely effects of the witness-vouching and hints at the existence of additional inculpatory evidence in First and Second Passages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In so stating, we obviously are unconvinced by the government's argument that the district court's admonition, in its final instructions, that \"the United States Government stands no higher before this Court than does Defendant\" was sufficient to cure both the witness-vouching in the First and Second Passages and the effect of the court's overruling of defense counsel's contemporaneous objections.  Indeed, this instruction, referring as it does to \"the United States Government,\" in no way rebuts the above-noted implication that Detectives Lennon and Lussier, as Providence police officers, had a heightened duty to testify honestly</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
