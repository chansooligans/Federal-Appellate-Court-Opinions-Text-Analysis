Goldman, by appointment of the court, with whom\nOrlen and Goldman was on brief for appellant.\n     Seth R. Aframe, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nJohn P. Kacavas, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 17, 2010\n\f           BOUDIN,     Circuit    Judge.        On   November    17,   2006,   a\n\nconfidential informant told an undercover officer--New Hampshire\n\nstate trooper Melissa Robles--about a man who was selling crack\n\ncocaine in Manchester.         At Robles' request, the informant called\n\nthe man to arrange a meeting.             That afternoon, the informant and\n\nRobles drove to a supermarket parking lot in Manchester where a man\n\narrived,     driving   alone     in   a     maroon   Chevrolet   Malibu   with\n\nConnecticut license plates, and introduced himself as \"Frenchie.\"\n\n           Frenchie entered Robles' car and--after ensuring that\n\nRobles was neither wired nor armed--sold her a baggie containing\n\n0.86 grams of crack cocaine, taken out of a stash of several\n\nbaggies, in exchange for $100 in cash (whose bill numbers had been\n\nrecorded).    Robles and Frenchie talked briefly after the sale, and\n\nthen Robles and the informant drove away.               A surveillance team\n\nobserved Frenchie, including his entry into and exit from Robles'\n\ncar.\n\n           Between November 2006 and July 2007, Robles made five\n\nother purchases of crack cocaine from Frenchie: on November 29,\n\n2006 ($200 for 1.96 grams); December 11, 2006 ($300 for 3.23\n\ngrams); January 9, 2007 ($200 for 2.36 grams); March 19, 2007 ($200\n\nfor 2.36 grams); and July 18, 2007 ($200 for 1.33 grams).               All but\n\nthe last purchase occurred in the afternoon in broad daylight; and\n\nRobles said it was still light out during the last, even though it\n\nwas in the evening.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          The    surveillance   team   observed   most   of    these\n\ntransactions.   They also watched Frenchie before and after some of\n\nthem, observing him on several occasions entering with a key and\n\nexiting a house at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester, which they\n\nconcluded was a base for his drug operations.     Audio recordings\n\nwere made of some of the meetings between Robles and Frenchie, and\n\nof some phone calls between Robles, Frenchie and two others.\n\n          One of the other phone call participants was Frenchie's\n\ncousin \"Zeus\" (whom Robles later identified as Jean Verdiner);\n\nFrenchie referred Robles to Zeus on one occasion when Frenchie was\n\nnot available to sell drugs and Robles then purchased drugs from\n\nZeus.   The second participant was a man Robles knew as \"Blaze\"\n\n(whom Robles later identified as Wilfrantz Verdiner); the silver\n\nChevrolet Impala that Frenchie drove to the March 19 and July 18,\n\n2007, transactions was registered in Wilfrantz's name, which also\n\nappeared on the 196 Lowell Street mailbox.\n\n          In between those last two transactions, Robles applied--\n\non March 26, 2007--for an arrest warrant, supplying an affidavit\n\nthat identified the subject of the warrant as \"Frenchie,\" a black\n\nmale who lived at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester. Robles arranged\n\nwith Manchester police officers to make that arrest on August 22,\n\n2007. That evening, Robles called Frenchie to set up a transaction\n\nand the two met in a supermarket parking lot in Hooksett.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           Frenchie arrived alone, driving the silver Impala that he\n\nhad driven to the two prior transactions.     He was holding a wad of\n\ntissues when Robles approached his car.     When Frenchie opened the\n\nwad, a small bag fell onto the passenger seat.       Reaching through\n\nthe car window, Robles placed $200 in marked bills on the seat and\n\ntook the bag, which contained 2.47 grams of crack cocaine.       After\n\nthe   purchase,   Robles'   supervisor   directed   Manchester   police\n\nsergeant Robert Moore to effect Frenchie's arrest.\n\n           A member of the surveillance team for some of the prior\n\ntransactions, Moore was parked in the same lot as Robles and\n\nFrenchie on August 22, 2007, and observed them conversing through\n\nFrenchie's car window.      Moore and fellow officer Stephen Coco,\n\nanother member of the team, watched Robles drive off and then\n\nindependently followed Frenchie's car until two other Manchester\n\nofficers stopped it, with Moore and Coco (as well as another member\n\nof the surveillance team) confirming from afar that the correct car\n\nhad been stopped.\n\n           The driver, ordered to exit the silver Impala, was James\n\nLaurent, whom Moore and Coco later identified as Frenchie both from\n\nseeing him and from his driver's license photograph. In the course\n\nof the arrest, the officers found $990 in cash on Laurent's person,\n\nincluding the marked $200 from Robles' drug purchase money and--\n\nstuffed into Laurent's waistband--marijuana and a clear plastic bag\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fcontaining 5.73 grams of crack cocaine.            The car also contained\n\nfour cell phones.\n\n            Laurent was indicted on seven counts of distributing\n\ncrack cocaine (the seven transactions already described) and one\n\ncount of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine (the\n\ncocaine seized upon his arrest).        21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1) (2006).          He\n\nfiled two motions to suppress evidence seized and statements made\n\nin connection with his August 22, 2007, arrest. The district judge\n\ndenied both motions.\n\n            In the jury trial that followed, Laurent did not testify,\n\nbut his primary defense was misidentification--that he was not\n\nFrenchie, and that instead Frenchie might have been Jean Verdiner,\n\nWilfrantz    Verdiner,      or   Shoubert   Beauchamps     (a   man    who    also\n\nreportedly    lived    at   196   Lowell    Street).       Laurent's    counsel\n\nemphasized that the government had no \"physical evidence connecting\n\nMr. Laurent to these charges,\" specifically, no photographs or\n\nvideo recordings of the meetings between Frenchie and Robles, and\n\nno fingerprint evidence connecting Laurent to the bags of crack\n\ncocaine.\n\n            During    cross-examination     of   Robles,    Laurent     and   his\n\ncounsel learned for the first time that a video recording had been\n\nmade of the first drug deal on November 17, 2006.            Robles explained\n\nupon further questioning that no video had been offered or would be\n\nat trial because when she requested it from the Manchester Police\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fDepartment a few months after Laurent's arrest, she learned that\n\nthe videotape--by then almost a year old--had been routinely erased\n\nby the Manchester Police Department pursuant to standard practice.\n\n          Laurent promptly filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that\n\nthe video's destruction and the failure to timely disclose its\n\ncreation and destruction had deprived him of material, potentially\n\nexculpatory evidence.   Robles said she had advised the federal\n\nprosecutor of the loss; and the prosecutor conceded that in the\n\ncourse of pretrial discovery, she must have learned of the tape and\n\nfailed to inform Laurent of its creation and destruction, but she\n\nsaid her omission was unintentional.       In response, the court\n\ndismissed the first count against Laurent--the count predicated on\n\nthe November 17, 2006, drug transaction.\n\n           The jury convicted Laurent on the seven remaining\n\ncounts--six of distribution and one of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute--and found that the drug weight for the last count was\n\ngreater than 5 grams.   Rejecting arguments for a lower sentence,\n\nthe court imposed a sentence of 84 months' imprisonment.    Laurent\n\nnow appeals from his conviction and sentence.\n\n          Laurent's main arguments on appeal concern the videotape.\n\nIn considering his claims, we are concerned with two events rather\n\nthan one: the erasure of the tape by the local police and the\n\nfailure by the federal prosecutor to disclose before trial the\n\nprior existence of the tape and its erasure to Laurent.    It is not\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fclear that the erasure can be held against the United States, which\n\napparently did not control the investigation and certainly did not\n\nerase the tape; but even if we simplify matters by assuming\n\notherwise, the destruction itself does not give Laurent a viable\n\nclaim.\n\n          Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 57-58 (1988), and\n\nrelated cases do recognize a due process violation where the\n\ngovernment destroys evidence in a criminal case, but not in all\n\ncircumstances.    The   Supreme   Court   has   distinguished   between\n\nevidence that was apparently exculpatory before the evidence was\n\ndestroyed, for which the failure to preserve is a due process\n\nviolation even without bad faith, and evidence that was only\n\n\"potentially useful\" for the defense, for which the defendant must\n\nestablish the government's bad faith to show a violation.1\n\n          Here, the video was only potentially useful, as Laurent's\n\ncounsel conceded in the district court; indeed, unless the several\n\nofficers were collectively lying, it is more likely than not--if\n\nthe seller in the tape were visible--that the tape would have\n\ninculpated Laurent. Thus, Laurent must prove bad faith destruction\n\nof evidence, but he has pointed to no evidence that would undermine\n\nthe government's description of a routine erasure, by no means\n\n\n     1\n      Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S. 544, 549 (2004) (per curiam);\nCalifornia v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485, 488-89 (1984);\nOlszewski v. Spencer, 466 F.3d 47, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2006), cert.\ndenied, 550 U.S. 911 (2007); United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990,\n993 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 936 (1995).\n\n                                  -7-\n\funcommon, e.g., United States v. Garza, 435 F.3d 73, 75-76 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1158 (2006); United States v. Lewis,\n\n40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Arra, 630 F.2d\n\n836,        849   (1st   Cir.   1980),   nor   were   the   circumstances   here\n\nsuspicious.\n\n                  Laurent's     second   argument,    directed    against   the\n\ngovernment's delayed disclosure, does implicate the United States,\n\nbecause the federal prosecutor (by Robles' account) was told of the\n\ntape.        Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), requires the\n\nprosecutor to produce exculpatory evidence to the defense and this\n\ncould conceivably include information that someone--even a private\n\ncitizen--had destroyed exculpatory evidence.                But, of course, the\n\ntape was not shown to be exculpatory and, as we shall explain, its\n\ndestruction provided no basis for an inference helpful to Laurent.\n\n                  However, the district court found that putting Brady to\n\none side, there had nevertheless been a violation of Federal Rule\n\nof Criminal Procedure 16, which governs pre-trial disclosure by\n\nfederal prosecutors in criminal cases.                Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a),\n\n(c).        Whether or not this is so,2 the government wisely does not\n\ndispute that it should have disclosed information about a destroyed\n\npiece of tangible evidence previously in police hands.                Instead,\n\n\n        2\n      The rule's language arguably required only that the\ngovernment produce the tape if it had it; the most pertinent\nlanguage in Rule 16 requires that \"material\" items of various kinds\nbe disclosed to the defense, but the items are all seemingly\ntangible or arguably so in context. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe government says that by dismissing the count directed at the\n\nvideotaped transaction, any possible prejudice was removed--ample\n\nsanction for an inadvertent failure to disclose.\n\n          To the extent that the nondisclosure was a violation, of\n\neither Brady or Rule 16, we review the district court's remedy for\n\nabuse of discretion.   United States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1,\n\n30-31 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1074 (2004); United States\n\nv. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1196 (1st Cir. 1996).       Where an error is\n\nunintentional, remedying prejudice is usually the key concern.3\n\nLaurent's only claim of prejudice from the nondisclosure is that\n\nhad disclosure been made, his counsel in opening argument would not\n\nhave said: \"You would think that the government who has, entirely\n\nhas the burden, would maybe take a little videotape of this drug\n\ntransaction or these drug transactions.      No.\"\n\n          Laurent   argues   that    when   Robles   then   revealed   in\n\ncross-examination that one video had been made--even though it was\n\nnow unavailable--it undermined his counsel's credibility in the\n\n\n\n     3\n      United States v. Van Anh, 523 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir.)\n(requiring the defendant to show prejudice from a Brady violation),\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 236 (2008); United States v. Alvarez, 987\nF.2d 77, 85 (1st Cir.) (same for Rule 16 violation), cert. denied,\n510 U.S. 849 (1993).       Prejudice from delayed disclosure is\nvariously described. E.g., United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280,\n290 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"given timeous disclosure [of the pertinent\ninformation], a more effective [defense] strategy would likely have\nresulted\"); United States v. De La Rosa, 196 F.3d 712, 716 (7th\nCir. 1999) (when defendant \"is unduly surprised and lacks an\nadequate opportunity to prepare a defense, or when the violation\nsubstantially influences the jury\").\n\n                                    -9-\n\fjury's eyes.   However, defense counsel was free to make clear that\n\nany misstatement was the government's fault; and, more important,\n\nit did not undermine counsel's consistent theme, from opening to\n\nclosing and in between: that the government could offer no physical\n\nevidence--such   as    videotapes--to      corroborate    its   officers'\n\nidentification of Laurent as Frenchie, and that it instead would\n\nrely on \"words, and words alone.\"\n\n          In   fact,   Robles'   delayed   revelation    arguably   helped\n\nLaurent's misidentification argument since his counsel wove the\n\nincident into his theme that the government had been \"deceptive,\n\nand that they have been hiding things, and you should hold that\n\nagainst them,\" combining the videotape's destruction with the\n\ngovernment's failure to present as a witness the confidential\n\ninformant who initially introduced Frenchie to Robles, and arguing\n\nthat this evidence was perhaps not presented because it would have\n\nrevealed that Laurent was not Frenchie.\n\n          Finally, no tweaking of defense counsel's argument could\n\nhave made any difference.        Multiple members of the surveillance\n\nteam identified Laurent as Frenchie;       he was seen making multiple\n\ndrug deals almost all in daylight with an undercover officer; and\n\nsurveillance followed his car from the last drug transaction to the\n\nstop where officers found marked bills and more drugs on his\n\nperson. Dismissal of the entire case--a rare remedy that is deemed\n\n\"drastic,\" Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d at 30, and \"draconian,\" United\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fStates v. Candelaria-Silva, 162 F.3d 698, 703 (1st Cir. 1998)--\n\ncould scarcely have been justified.\n\n          Alternatively,      Laurent    claims   that   at    a   minimum   a\n\ncontinuance   should   have    been     granted   so   his    counsel   could\n\ninvestigate further the details of the destruction.                But while\n\ncounsel did request a continuance and discovery as a possible\n\nlesser remedy in his written motion to dismiss the entire case,\n\nLaurent did not advocate a lengthy continuance when discussing the\n\nmotion with the judge and prosecutor and he did not push for a\n\nlonger continuance when the government suggested a short one.\n\n          Sanctions aside, Laurent argues that the district court\n\nshould have instructed the jury that it could draw an adverse\n\ninference from the destruction of the video.4          He had proposed the\n\nfollowing instruction, which the court did not give:\n\n                 Evidence has been heard that the\n          prosecution and its agents at one time\n          possessed a videotape of the alleged drug sale\n          occurring on November 17, 2006.\n\n                 You may assume that such evidence would\n          have been unfavorable to the prosecution only\n          if you find by a preponderance of the evidence\n          that:\n                 (1) The prosecution and its\n                 agents negligently destroyed or\n\n\n\n     4\n      The heading of the argument in Laurent's brief suggests that\nhe is attacking the failure of the district court to allow an\ninference based on the delayed disclosure rather than the erasure\nof the tape; but, as this is neither the instruction sought in the\ndistrict court nor the error urged below the heading, we ignore\nthis variation.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f                     caused   the  evidence   to   be\n                     destroyed; or\n                     (2) The prosecution and its\n                     agents caused the evidence to be\n                     destroyed in bad faith.\n\n            The government says that this claim is subject only to\n\nplain error review because no objection was made after the court\n\ncharged the jury.         Compare Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d) (requiring\n\nobjection \"before the jury retires to deliberate\" or else plain\n\nerror review applies), with Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b)(2), (c) (allowing\n\nobjection   before      closing   arguments    and   jury   instructions      to\n\npreserve appellate rights).         We bypass the government's waiver\n\nargument because the refusal to give the charge was not error at\n\nall.\n\n            A    \"spoliation\"     instruction,       allowing   an       adverse\n\ninference, is commonly appropriate in both civil and criminal cases\n\nwhere there is evidence from which a reasonable jury might conclude\n\nthat evidence favorable to one side was destroyed by the other.               4\n\nL.

Corp., 306\nF.3d 99, 101, 108-10 (2d Cir. 2002) (negligent destruction is\nenough if other indications suggest the evidence would have favored\nthe party affected by the destruction).       Our own decision in\nNation-Wide Check Corp. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc., 692 F.2d\n214, 217-20 (1st Cir. 1982), is not entirely clear on this point.\nSee also Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, 81 F.3d 1148, 1159 (1st Cir.\n1996) (stating that the factfinder is \"free to reject\" the adverse\ninference when it believes the evidence was \"destroyed accidentally\nor for an innocent reason\").\n\n                               -13-\n\ftime had elapsed without an arrest creates no inference that the\n\ntape was destroyed because it contained evidence favorable to the\n\ndefendant. Cf. Pimentel v. Jacobsen Fishing Co., 102 F.3d 638, 640\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding a district court's refusal to draw an\n\nadverse inference from an inadvertent destruction of evidence to be\n\nneither clear error nor an abuse of discretion).\n\n           Admittedly, this explanation of what happened rests on\n\nRobles'   testimony,   but   it   was    given    under   oath   and   was   not\n\nimplausible.      If   Laurent's        counsel    seriously     doubted     the\n\nexplanation, he could have said why and pressed unequivocally for\n\nan opportunity to conduct discovery about it.             He did neither and,\n\ngiven the dismissal of the count in question, his course was hardly\n\nunreasonable: nothing suggested that the police had erased this\n\nparticular tape for any reason beyond the passage of time.\n\n           Laurent next argues that the district court should have\n\ngranted his motions to suppress--on two different grounds--the\n\nevidence seized and Laurent's statements made upon his August 22,\n\n2007, arrest.   The first is that the arrest warrant issued on March\n\n26, 2007, was tainted by Robles' affidavit stating that Frenchie\n\nlived at 196 Lowell Street when in fact (Laurent says) she believed\n\nFrenchie resided out of state and used 196 Lowell Street as a base\n\nfor drug operations.\n\n           Given Frenchie's observed access to and use of the\n\npremises, the discrepancy appears trivial and no basis for a\n\n                                   -14-\n\fhearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).\n\nFurther, the arrest warrant was unnecessary and invalidating it\n\nwould not change the outcome: the arrest was amply supported by\n\nprobable cause--the observations of the August 22, 2007, offense by\n\nseveral officers who collectively confirmed that Laurent was the\n\nman       observed   committing   that    offense--and   was   therefore\n\nindependently valid without the need for a warrant.       United States\n\nv. Link, 238 F.3d 106, 109 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              Laurent's second ground for suppression rests on the\n\npremise that the officers found the drugs in Laurent's car and not\n\non Laurent's person--a premise that is far from settled.6        He then\n\nargues that the officers exceeded the bounds of their authority,\n\nunder Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), by searching his car as\n\npart of a mere traffic stop rather than only patting him down for\n\nweapons.      Of course, if the drugs were found on Laurent, a full\n\nsearch of his person and not a mere pat down was permitted incident\n\nto his lawful arrest.      United States v. Vongkaysone, 434 F.3d 68,\n\n75 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1142 (2006).\n\n              Even if the drugs were found in the car and not on\n\nLaurent's person, the car search was permitted because there was\n\n\n      6\n      The claim rests on Laurent's interpretation of an audio\nrecording of the arrest; but in fact, the excerpt of the audio\nrecording transcript does not clearly support his factual claim,\nwhich was directly contradicted by the searching officer's\ntestimony that the drugs were found on Laurent's person.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fprobable cause to suspect drugs would be found there, given that\n\nofficers had followed the car immediately after a drug transaction\n\ninvolving     Laurent   and   given    Laurent's    tendency     in     prior\n\ntransactions to sell crack cocaine out of a stash of multiple bags\n\nthat he had with him.    Maryland v. Dyson, 527 U.S. 465, 467 (1999)\n\n(per curiam); United States v. Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 543-45 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1074 (2005). \"Police may search\n\na vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest . . . [if] it is\n\nreasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense\n\nof arrest.\"    Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 1723-24 (2009).\n\n            Finally, Laurent argues that the district court erred in\n\ndetermining his sentence because it relied upon incorrect factual\n\nassumptions about crack cocaine.           Based on the convictions, the\n\namount of drugs and Laurent's criminal history, the court found his\n\ntotal offense level to be 24 and his criminal history category to\n\nbe IV, yielding a sentence range of 77 to 96 months.           The sentence\n\nimposed was in the middle of the range.        Laurent does not now claim\n\nthat the range was incorrectly calculated.\n\n            Rather, Laurent requested a lower sentence, arguing among\n\nother things that the court should downward depart to mitigate the\n\npowder   cocaine/crack    cocaine     sentencing   disparity    under    the\n\nguidelines.    In refusing this request, the sentencing judge said--\n\nin comments now assailed by Laurent--that crack cocaine is \"more\n\ndevious,\" \"more addictive,\" \"more dangerous,\" \"more destructive,\"\n\n                                    -16-\n\fand \"more devastating to society than powder cocaine\" and that\n\ntherefore crack cocaine distribution offenses are at \"a higher\n\nculpability level.\"\n\n           On this appeal, Laurent claims that in Kimbrough v.\n\nUnited   States,   552    U.S.   85,    97-98   (2007),   the   Supreme    Court\n\nrecognized these facts as disproved, and he asserts that the\n\nJustice Department supports legislation to \"completely eliminate\n\nthe sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine,\"\n\ne.g., Unfairness in Federal Cocaine Sentencing: Is It Time to Crack\n\nthe 100 to 1 Disparity: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Crime,\n\nTerrorism, & Homeland Sec. of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 111th\n\nCong. 28 (2009) (statement of Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Att'y\n\nGen., Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice).\n\n           Kimbrough took note of the extreme sentencing disparity\n\nthen existing under the guidelines and held that a district court\n\nmay   depart   downward     based      on   policy   disagreement   with    the\n\nguidelines' disparity, but the Court did not require a departure or\n\na variance.    552 U.S. at 91, 101; accord Spears v. United States,\n\n129 S. Ct. 840, 843-44 (2009) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nGibbons, 553 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 2009).            The district court was\n\naware of its option to depart downward on that basis, but declined\n\nto exercise it.\n\n           Further, the disparity on which Kimbrough cast doubt was\n\nthe then-applicable crack-powder sentencing disparity that was\n\n                                       -17-\n\fparticularly extreme, see 552 U.S. at 91, and subsequent amendments\n\nto the guidelines shrank that disparity by reducing the offense\n\nlevels for crack cocaine offenses, U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706\n\n(Supp. Nov. 1, 2009).           Laurent benefited from those reductions\n\nbecause    his     sentencing   range       was    determined       by   the   revised\n\nguidelines.\n\n            Neither      Kimbrough    nor    the    Sentencing       Commission   has\n\ndeclared    that    no   sentencing       disparity      can   be   justified;    and\n\nCongress and the Commission continue to believe some disparity is\n\njustified     by    differences      in     the    two    drugs'     addictiveness,\n\npropensity to involve weapons or injury, and association with\n\nhigher levels of crime.

At Robles' request, the informant called the man to arrange a meeting. That afternoon, the informant and Robles drove to a supermarket parking lot in Manchester where a man arrived, driving alone in a maroon Chevrolet Malibu with Connecticut license plates, and introduced himself as \"Frenchie.\"</p>\n<p>Frenchie entered Robles' car andยafter ensuring that Robles was neither wired nor armedยsold her a baggie containing 0.86 grams of crack cocaine, taken out of a stash of several baggies, in exchange for $100 in cash (whose bill numbers had been recorded). Robles and Frenchie talked briefly after the sale, and then Robles and the informant drove away. A surveillance team observed Frenchie, including his entry into and exit from Robles' car.</p>\n<p>Between November 2006 and July 2007, Robles made five other purchases of crack cocaine from Frenchie: on November 29, 2006 ($200 for 1.96 grams); December 11, 2006 ($300 for 3.23 grams); January 9, 2007 ($200 for 2.36 grams); March 19, 2007 ($200 for 2.36 grams); and July 18, 2007 ($200 for 1.33 grams). All but the last purchase occurred in the afternoon in broad daylight; and Robles said it was still light out during the last, even though it was in the evening.</p>\n<p>The surveillance team observed most of these transactions. They also watched Frenchie before and after some of them, observing him on several occasions entering with a key and exiting a house at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester, which they concluded was a base for his drug operations. Audio recordings were made of some of the meetings between Robles and Frenchie, and of some phone calls between Robles, Frenchie and two others.</p>\n<p>One of the other phone call participants was Frenchie's cousin \"Zeus\" (whom Robles later identified as Jean Verdiner); Frenchie referred Robles to Zeus on one occasion when Frenchie was not available to sell drugs and Robles then purchased drugs from Zeus. The second participant was a man Robles knew as \"Blaze\" (whom Robles later identified as Wilfrantz Verdiner); the silver Chevrolet Impala that Frenchie drove to the March 19 and July 18, 2007, transactions was registered in Wilfrantz's name, which also appeared on the 196 Lowell Street mailbox.</p>\n<p>In between those last two transactions, Robles appliedยon March 26, 2007ยfor an arrest warrant, supplying an affidavit that identified the subject of the warrant as \"Frenchie,\" a black male who lived at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester. Robles arranged with Manchester police officers to make that arrest on August 22, 2007. That evening, Robles called Frenchie to set up a transaction and the two met in a supermarket parking lot in Hooksett.</p>\n<p>Frenchie arrived alone, driving the silver Impala that he had driven to the two prior transactions. He was holding a wad of tissues when Robles approached his car. When Frenchie opened the wad, a small bag fell onto the passenger seat. Reaching through the car window, Robles placed $200 in marked bills on the seat and took the bag, which contained 2.47 grams of crack cocaine. After the purchase, Robles' supervisor directed Manchester police sergeant Robert Moore to effect Frenchie's arrest.</p>\n<p>A member of the surveillance team for some of the prior transactions, Moore was parked in the same lot as Robles and Frenchie on August 22, 2007, and observed them conversing through Frenchie's car window. Moore and fellow officer Stephen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> Coco, another member of the team, watched Robles drive off and then independently followed Frenchie's car until two other Manchester officers stopped it, with Moore and Coco (as well as another member of the surveillance team) confirming from afar that the correct car had been stopped.</p>\n<p>The driver, ordered to exit the silver Impala, was James Laurent, whom Moore and Coco later identified as Frenchie both from seeing him and from his driver's license photograph. In the course of the arrest, the officers found $990 in cash on Laurent's person, including the marked $200 from Robles' drug purchase money andยstuffed into Laurent's waistbandย marijuana and a clear plastic bag containing 5.73 grams of crack cocaine. The car also contained four cell phones.</p>\n<p>Laurent was indicted on seven counts of distributing crack cocaine (the seven transactions already described) and one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine (the cocaine seized upon his arrest). 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1) (2006). He filed two motions to suppress evidence seized and statements made in connection with his August 22, 2007, arrest. The district judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p>In the jury trial that followed, Laurent did not testify, but his primary defense was misidentificationยthat he was not Frenchie, and that instead Frenchie might have been Jean Verdiner, Wilfrantz Verdiner, or Shoubert Beauchamps (a man who also reportedly lived at 196 Lowell Street). Laurent's counsel emphasized that the government had no \"physical evidence connecting Mr. Laurent to these charges,\" specifically, no photographs or video recordings of the meetings between Frenchie and Robles, and no fingerprint evidence connecting Laurent to the bags of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>During cross-examination of Robles, Laurent and his counsel learned for the first time that a video recording had been made of the first drug deal on November 17, 2006. Robles explained upon further questioning that no video had been offered or would be at trial because when she requested it from the Manchester Police Department a few months after Laurent's arrest, she learned that the videotapeยby then almost a year oldยhad been routinely erased by the Manchester Police Department pursuant to standard practice.</p>\n<p>Laurent promptly filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the video's destruction and the failure to timely disclose its creation and destruction had deprived him of material, potentially exculpatory evidence. Robles said she had advised the federal prosecutor of the loss; and the prosecutor conceded that in the course of pretrial discovery, she must have learned of the tape and failed to inform Laurent of its creation and destruction, but she said her omission was unintentional. In response, the court dismissed the first count against Laurentยthe count predicated on the November 17, 2006, drug transaction.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Laurent on the seven remaining countsยsix of distribution and one of possession with intent to distributeยand found that the drug weight for the last count was greater than 5 grams. Rejecting arguments for a lower sentence, the court imposed a sentence of 84 months' imprisonment. Laurent now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>Laurent's main arguments on appeal concern the videotape. In considering his claims, we are concerned with two events rather than one: the erasure of the tape by the local police and the failure by the federal prosecutor to disclose before trial the prior existence of the tape and its erasure to Laurent. It is not clear that the erasure can be held against the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> States, which apparently did not control the investigation and certainly did not erase the tape; but even if we simplify matters by assuming otherwise, the destruction itself does not give Laurent a viable claim.</p>\n<p><i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i> 488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988), and related cases do recognize a due process violation where the government destroys evidence in a criminal case, but not in all circumstances. The Supreme Court has distinguished between evidence that was apparently exculpatory before the evidence was destroyed, for which the failure to preserve is a due process violation even without bad faith, and evidence that was only \"potentially useful\" for the defense, for which the defendant must establish the government's bad faith to show a violation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the video was only potentially useful, as Laurent's counsel conceded in the district court; indeed, unless the several officers were collectively lying, it is more likely than notยif the seller in the tape were visibleยthat the tape would have <i>inculpated</i> Laurent. Thus, Laurent must prove bad faith destruction of evidence, but he has pointed to no evidence that would undermine the government's description of a routine erasure, by no means uncommon, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Garza,</i> 435 F.3d 73, 75-76 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 547 U.S. 1158, 126 S.Ct. 2313, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Arra,</i> 630 F.2d 836, 849 (1st Cir.1980), nor were the circumstances here suspicious.</p>\n<p>Laurent's second argument, directed against the government's delayed disclosure, does implicate the United States, because the federal prosecutor (by Robles' account) was told of the tape. <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), requires the prosecutor to produce exculpatory evidence to the defense and this could conceivably include information that someoneยeven a private citizenยhad destroyed exculpatory evidence. But, of course, the tape was not shown to be exculpatory and, as we shall explain, its destruction provided no basis for an inference helpful to Laurent.</p>\n<p>However, the district court found that putting <i>Brady</i> to one side, there had nevertheless been a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which governs pre-trial disclosure by federal prosecutors in criminal cases. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a), (c). Whether or not this is so,<sup>[2]</sup> the government wisely does not dispute that it should have disclosed information about a destroyed piece of tangible evidence previously in police hands. Instead, the government says that by dismissing the count directed at the videotaped transaction, any possible prejudice was removedยample sanction for an inadvertent failure to disclose.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> To the extent that the nondisclosure was a violation, of either <i>Brady</i> or Rule 16, we review the district court's remedy for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 30-31 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1074, 124 S.Ct. 2412, 158 L.Ed.2d 985 (2004); <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 99 F.3d 1182, 1196 (1st Cir.1996). Where an error is unintentional, remedying prejudice is usually the key concern.<sup>[3]</sup> Laurent's only claim of prejudice from the nondisclosure is that had disclosure been made, his counsel in opening argument would not have said: \"You would think that the government who has, entirely has the burden, would maybe take a little videotape of this drug transaction or these drug transactions. No.\"</p>\n<p>Laurent argues that when Robles then revealed in cross-examination that one video <i>had</i> been madeยeven though it was now unavailableยit undermined his counsel's credibility in the jury's eyes. However, defense counsel was free to make clear that any misstatement was the government's fault; and, more important, it did not undermine counsel's consistent theme, from opening to closing and in between: that the government could offer no physical evidenceยsuch as videotapesยto corroborate its officers' identification of Laurent as Frenchie, and that it instead would rely on \"words, and words alone.\"</p>\n<p>In fact, Robles' delayed revelation arguably helped Laurent's misidentification argument since his counsel wove the incident into his theme that the government had been \"deceptive, and that they have been hiding things, and you should hold that against them,\" combining the videotape's destruction with the government's failure to present as a witness the confidential informant who initially introduced Frenchie to Robles, and arguing that this evidence was perhaps not presented because it would have revealed that Laurent was not Frenchie.</p>\n<p>Finally, no tweaking of defense counsel's argument could have made any difference. Multiple members of the surveillance team identified Laurent as Frenchie; he was seen making multiple drug deals almost all in daylight with an undercover officer; and surveillance followed his car from the last drug transaction to the stop where officers found marked bills and more drugs on his person. Dismissal of the entire caseยa rare remedy that is deemed \"drastic,\" <i>Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 30, and \"draconian,\" <i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> 162 F.3d 698, 703 (1st Cir.1998)ยcould scarcely have been justified.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Laurent claims that at a minimum a continuance should have been granted so his counsel could investigate further the details of the destruction. But while counsel did request a continuance and discovery as a possible lesser remedy in his written motion to dismiss the entire case, Laurent did not advocate a lengthy continuance when discussing the motion with the judge and prosecutor and he did not push for a longer continuance when the government suggested a short one.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> Sanctions aside, Laurent argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the destruction of the video.<sup>[4]</sup> He had proposed the following instruction, which the court did not give:</p>\n<blockquote>Evidence has been heard that the prosecution and its agents at one time possessed a videotape of the alleged drug sale occurring on November 17, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may assume that such evidence would have been unfavorable to the prosecution only if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The prosecution and its agents negligently destroyed or caused the evidence to be destroyed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The prosecution and its agents caused the evidence to be destroyed in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p>The government says that this claim is subject only to plain error review because no objection was made after the court charged the jury. <i>Compare</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 30(d) (requiring objection \"before the jury retires to deliberate\" or else plain error review applies), <i>with</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2), (c) (allowing objection before closing arguments and jury instructions to preserve appellate rights). We bypass the government's waiver argument because the refusal to give the charge was not error at all.</p>\n<p>A \"spoliation\" instruction, allowing an adverse inference, is commonly appropriate in both civil and criminal cases where there is evidence from which a reasonable jury might conclude that evidence favorable to one side was destroyed by the other. 4 L. Sand et al., <i>Modern Federal Jury Instructions</i> ยง 75.01 (instruction 75-7), at 75-16 to -18 (2010). The burden is upon the party seeking the instruction to establish such evidence. 4 Sand et al., <i>supra,</i> ยง 75.01, at 75-18; <i>United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.) (\"[A] defendant is not entitled to an instruction on a defense when the evidence in the record does not support that defense.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 949, 122 S.Ct. 2642, 153 L.Ed.2d 821 (2002).</p>\n<p>In general, the instruction usually makes sense only where the evidence permits a finding of bad faith destruction; ordinarily, <i>negligent</i> destruction would not support the logical inference that the evidence was favorable to the defendant. 4 Sand et al., <i>supra,</i> ยง 75.01, at 75-17. But the case law is not uniform in the culpability needed for the instruction<sup>[5]</sup> and, anyway, unusual circumstances or even other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> policies might warrant exceptions. Consider, for example, negligent destruction of a particular piece of evidence likely to be exculpatory or routine destruction of a class of such evidenceยneither variation being present here.</p>\n<p>In all events, above all else an instruction must make sense in the context of the evidence, and no adverse-inference instruction would make sense here. The routine erasure of a video surveillance tape by the Manchester Police Department after much time had elapsed without an arrest creates no inference that the tape was destroyed because it contained evidence favorable to the defendant. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pimentel v. Jacobsen Fishing Co.,</i> 102 F.3d 638, 640 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996) (finding a district court's refusal to draw an adverse inference from an inadvertent destruction of evidence to be neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, this explanation of what happened rests on Robles' testimony, but it was given under oath and was not implausible. If Laurent's counsel seriously doubted the explanation, he could have said why and pressed unequivocally for an opportunity to conduct discovery about it. He did neither and, given the dismissal of the count in question, his course was hardly unreasonable: nothing suggested that the police had erased this particular tape for any reason beyond the passage of time.</p>\n<p>Laurent next argues that the district court should have granted his motions to suppressยon two different groundsย the evidence seized and Laurent's statements made upon his August 22, 2007, arrest. The first is that the arrest warrant issued on March 26, 2007, was tainted by Robles' affidavit stating that Frenchie lived at 196 Lowell Street when in fact (Laurent says) she believed Frenchie resided out of state and used 196 Lowell Street as a base for drug operations.</p>\n<p>Given Frenchie's observed access to and use of the premises, the discrepancy appears trivial and no basis for a hearing pursuant to <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Further, the arrest warrant was unnecessary and invalidating it would not change the outcome: the arrest was amply supported by probable causeยthe observations of the August 22, 2007, offense by several officers who collectively confirmed that Laurent was the man observed committing that offenseยand was therefore independently valid without the need for a warrant. <i>United States v. Link,</i> 238 F.3d 106, 109 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Laurent's second ground for suppression rests on the premise that the officers found the drugs in Laurent's car and not on Laurent's personยa premise that is far from settled.<sup>[6]</sup> He then argues that the officers exceeded the bounds of their authority, under <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), by searching his car as part of a mere traffic stop rather than only patting him down for weapons. Of course, if the drugs were found on Laurent, a full search of his person and not a mere pat down was permitted incident to his lawful arrest. <i>United States v. Vongkaysone,</i> 434 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2055, 164 L.Ed.2d 805 (2006).</p>\n<p>Even if the drugs were found in the car and not on Laurent's person, the car search was permitted because there <span class=\"star-pagination\">*904</span> was probable cause to suspect drugs would be found there, given that officers had followed the car immediately after a drug transaction involving Laurent and given Laurent's tendency in prior transactions to sell crack cocaine out of a stash of multiple bags that he had with him. <i>Maryland v. Dyson,</i> 527 U.S. 465, 467, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 380 F.3d 538, 543-45 (1st Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 1074, 125 S.Ct. 924, 160 L.Ed.2d 812 (2005). \"Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest . . .

Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___-___, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1723-24, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009).</p>\n<p>Finally, Laurent argues that the district court erred in determining his sentence because it relied upon incorrect factual assumptions about crack cocaine. Based on the convictions, the amount of drugs and Laurent's criminal history, the court found his total offense level to be 24 and his criminal history category to be IV, yielding a sentence range of 77 to 96 months. The sentence imposed was in the middle of the range. Laurent does not now claim that the range was incorrectly calculated.</p>\n<p>Rather, Laurent requested a lower sentence, arguing among other things that the court should downward depart to mitigate the powder cocaine/crack cocaine sentencing disparity under the guidelines. In refusing this request, the sentencing judge saidยin comments now assailed by Laurentยthat crack cocaine is \"more devious,\" \"more addictive,\" \"more dangerous,\" \"more destructive,\" and \"more devastating to society than powder cocaine\" and that therefore crack cocaine distribution offenses are at \"a higher culpability level.\"</p>\n<p>On this appeal, Laurent claims that in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 85, 97-98, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the Supreme Court recognized these facts as disproved, and he asserts that the Justice Department supports legislation to \"completely eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine,\" <i>e.g., Unfairness in Federal Cocaine Sentencing: Is It Time to Crack the 100 to 1 Disparity: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Crime, Terrorism, &amp; Homeland Sec. of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 111th Cong. 28 (2009) (statement of Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Att'y Gen., Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice).</p>\n<p><i>Kimbrough</i> took note of the extreme sentencing disparity then existing under the guidelines and held that a district court <i>may</i> depart downward based on policy disagreement with the guidelines' disparity, but the Court did not require a departure or a variance. 552 U.S. at 91, 101, 128 S.Ct. 558; <i>accord Spears v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___-___, 129 S.Ct. 840, 843-44, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Gibbons,</i> 553 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.2009). The district court was aware of its option to depart downward on that basis, but declined to exercise it.</p>\n<p>Further, the disparity on which <i>Kimbrough</i> cast doubt was the then-applicable crack-powder sentencing disparity that was particularly extreme, <i>see</i> 552 U.S. at 91, 128 S.Ct. 558, and subsequent amendments to the guidelines shrank that disparity by reducing the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2009). Laurent benefited from those reductions because his sentencing range was determined by the revised guidelines.</p>\n<p>Neither <i>Kimbrough</i> nor the Sentencing Commission has declared that <i>no</i> sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*905</span> disparity can be justified; and Congress and the Commission continue to believe some disparity is justified by differences in the two drugs' addictiveness, propensity to involve weapons or injury, and association with higher levels of crime. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 552 U.S. at 98-99, 105, 128 S.Ct. 558; U.S. Sentencing Comm'n, <i>Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy</i> 32, 62 (May 2007).

At Robles' request, the informant called the man to arrange a meeting. That afternoon, the informant and Robles drove to a supermarket parking lot in Manchester where a man arrived, driving alone in a maroon Chevrolet Malibu with Connecticut license plates, and introduced himself as \"Frenchie.\"</p>\n<p>Frenchie entered Robles' car andยafter ensuring that Robles was neither wired nor armedยsold her a baggie containing 0.86 grams of crack cocaine, taken out of a stash of several baggies, in exchange for $100 in cash (whose bill numbers had been recorded). Robles and Frenchie talked briefly after the sale, and then Robles and the informant drove away. A surveillance team observed Frenchie, including his entry into and exit from Robles' car.</p>\n<p>Between November 2006 and July 2007, Robles made five other purchases of crack cocaine from Frenchie: on November 29, 2006 ($200 for 1.96 grams); December 11, 2006 ($300 for 3.23 grams); January 9, 2007 ($200 for 2.36 grams); March 19, 2007 ($200 for 2.36 grams); and July 18, 2007 ($200 for 1.33 grams). All but the last purchase occurred in the afternoon in broad daylight; and Robles said it was still light out during the last, even though it was in the evening.</p>\n<p>The surveillance team observed most of these transactions. They also watched Frenchie before and after some of them, observing him on several occasions entering with a key and exiting a house at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester, which they concluded was a base for his drug operations. Audio recordings were made of some of the meetings between Robles and Frenchie, and of some phone calls between Robles, Frenchie and two others.</p>\n<p>One of the other phone call participants was Frenchie's cousin \"Zeus\" (whom Robles later identified as Jean Verdiner); Frenchie referred Robles to Zeus on one occasion when Frenchie was not available to sell drugs and Robles then purchased drugs from Zeus. The second participant was a man Robles knew as \"Blaze\" (whom Robles later identified as Wilfrantz Verdiner); the silver Chevrolet Impala that Frenchie drove to the March 19 and July 18, 2007, transactions was registered in Wilfrantz's name, which also appeared on the 196 Lowell Street mailbox.</p>\n<p>In between those last two transactions, Robles appliedยon March 26, 2007ยfor an arrest warrant, supplying an affidavit that identified the subject of the warrant as \"Frenchie,\" a black male who lived at 196 Lowell Street in Manchester. Robles arranged with Manchester police officers to make that arrest on August 22, 2007. That evening, Robles called Frenchie to set up a transaction and the two met in a supermarket parking lot in Hooksett.</p>\n<p>Frenchie arrived alone, driving the silver Impala that he had driven to the two prior transactions. He was holding a wad of tissues when Robles approached his car. When Frenchie opened the wad, a small bag fell onto the passenger seat. Reaching through the car window, Robles placed $200 in marked bills on the seat and took the bag, which contained 2.47 grams of crack cocaine. After the purchase, Robles' supervisor directed Manchester police sergeant Robert Moore to effect Frenchie's arrest.</p>\n<p>A member of the surveillance team for some of the prior transactions, Moore was parked in the same lot as Robles and Frenchie on August 22, 2007, and observed them conversing through Frenchie's car window. Moore and fellow officer Stephen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> Coco, another member of the team, watched Robles drive off and then independently followed Frenchie's car until two other Manchester officers stopped it, with Moore and Coco (as well as another member of the surveillance team) confirming from afar that the correct car had been stopped.</p>\n<p>The driver, ordered to exit the silver Impala, was James Laurent, whom Moore and Coco later identified as Frenchie both from seeing him and from his driver's license photograph. In the course of the arrest, the officers found $990 in cash on Laurent's person, including the marked $200 from Robles' drug purchase money andยstuffed into Laurent's waistbandย marijuana and a clear plastic bag containing 5.73 grams of crack cocaine. The car also contained four cell phones.</p>\n<p>Laurent was indicted on seven counts of distributing crack cocaine (the seven transactions already described) and one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine (the cocaine seized upon his arrest). 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1) (2006). He filed two motions to suppress evidence seized and statements made in connection with his August 22, 2007, arrest. The district judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p>In the jury trial that followed, Laurent did not testify, but his primary defense was misidentificationยthat he was not Frenchie, and that instead Frenchie might have been Jean Verdiner, Wilfrantz Verdiner, or Shoubert Beauchamps (a man who also reportedly lived at 196 Lowell Street). Laurent's counsel emphasized that the government had no \"physical evidence connecting Mr. Laurent to these charges,\" specifically, no photographs or video recordings of the meetings between Frenchie and Robles, and no fingerprint evidence connecting Laurent to the bags of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>During cross-examination of Robles, Laurent and his counsel learned for the first time that a video recording had been made of the first drug deal on November 17, 2006. Robles explained upon further questioning that no video had been offered or would be at trial because when she requested it from the Manchester Police Department a few months after Laurent's arrest, she learned that the videotapeยby then almost a year oldยhad been routinely erased by the Manchester Police Department pursuant to standard practice.</p>\n<p>Laurent promptly filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the video's destruction and the failure to timely disclose its creation and destruction had deprived him of material, potentially exculpatory evidence. Robles said she had advised the federal prosecutor of the loss; and the prosecutor conceded that in the course of pretrial discovery, she must have learned of the tape and failed to inform Laurent of its creation and destruction, but she said her omission was unintentional. In response, the court dismissed the first count against Laurentยthe count predicated on the November 17, 2006, drug transaction.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Laurent on the seven remaining countsยsix of distribution and one of possession with intent to distributeยand found that the drug weight for the last count was greater than 5 grams. Rejecting arguments for a lower sentence, the court imposed a sentence of 84 months' imprisonment. Laurent now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>Laurent's main arguments on appeal concern the videotape. In considering his claims, we are concerned with two events rather than one: the erasure of the tape by the local police and the failure by the federal prosecutor to disclose before trial the prior existence of the tape and its erasure to Laurent. It is not clear that the erasure can be held against the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> States, which apparently did not control the investigation and certainly did not erase the tape; but even if we simplify matters by assuming otherwise, the destruction itself does not give Laurent a viable claim.</p>\n<p><i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 57-58, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span> (1988), and related cases do recognize a due process violation where the government destroys evidence in a criminal case, but not in all circumstances. The Supreme Court has distinguished between evidence that was apparently exculpatory before the evidence was destroyed, for which the failure to preserve is a due process violation even without bad faith, and evidence that was only \"potentially useful\" for the defense, for which the defendant must establish the government's bad faith to show a violation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, the video was only potentially useful, as Laurent's counsel conceded in the district court; indeed, unless the several officers were collectively lying, it is more likely than notยif the seller in the tape were visibleยthat the tape would have <i>inculpated</i> Laurent. Thus, Laurent must prove bad faith destruction of evidence, but he has pointed to no evidence that would undermine the government's description of a routine erasure, by no means uncommon, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v.

But, of course, the tape was not shown to be exculpatory and, as we shall explain, its destruction provided no basis for an inference helpful to Laurent.</p>\n<p>However, the district court found that putting <i>Brady</i> to one side, there had nevertheless been a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which governs pre-trial disclosure by federal prosecutors in criminal cases. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a), (c). Whether or not this is so,<sup>[2]</sup> the government wisely does not dispute that it should have disclosed information about a destroyed piece of tangible evidence previously in police hands. Instead, the government says that by dismissing the count directed at the videotaped transaction, any possible prejudice was removedยample sanction for an inadvertent failure to disclose.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> To the extent that the nondisclosure was a violation, of either <i>Brady</i> or Rule 16, we review the district court's remedy for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

Where an error is unintentional, remedying prejudice is usually the key concern.<sup>[3]</sup> Laurent's only claim of prejudice from the nondisclosure is that had disclosure been made, his counsel in opening argument would not have said: \"You would think that the government who has, entirely has the burden, would maybe take a little videotape of this drug transaction or these drug transactions. No.\"</p>\n<p>Laurent argues that when Robles then revealed in cross-examination that one video <i>had</i> been madeยeven though it was now unavailableยit undermined his counsel's credibility in the jury's eyes. However, defense counsel was free to make clear that any misstatement was the government's fault; and, more important, it did not undermine counsel's consistent theme, from opening to closing and in between: that the government could offer no physical evidenceยsuch as videotapesยto corroborate its officers' identification of Laurent as Frenchie, and that it instead would rely on \"words, and words alone.\"</p>\n<p>In fact, Robles' delayed revelation arguably helped Laurent's misidentification argument since his counsel wove the incident into his theme that the government had been \"deceptive, and that they have been hiding things, and you should hold that against them,\" combining the videotape's destruction with the government's failure to present as a witness the confidential informant who initially introduced Frenchie to Robles, and arguing that this evidence was perhaps not presented because it would have revealed that Laurent was not Frenchie.</p>\n<p>Finally, no tweaking of defense counsel's argument could have made any difference. Multiple members of the surveillance team identified Laurent as Frenchie; he was seen making multiple drug deals almost all in daylight with an undercover officer; and surveillance followed his car from the last drug transaction to the stop where officers found marked bills and more drugs on his person. Dismissal of the entire caseยa rare remedy that is deemed \"drastic,\" <i>Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d at 30, and \"draconian,\" <i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198241\"><a href=\"/opinion/198241/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 703 (1st Cir.1998)ยcould scarcely have been justified.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Laurent claims that at a minimum a continuance should have been granted so his counsel could investigate further the details of the destruction. But while counsel did request a continuance and discovery as a possible lesser remedy in his written motion to dismiss the entire case, Laurent did not advocate a lengthy continuance when discussing the motion with the judge and prosecutor and he did not push for a longer continuance when the government suggested a short one.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> Sanctions aside, Laurent argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the destruction of the video.<sup>[4]</sup> He had proposed the following instruction, which the court did not give:</p>\n<blockquote>Evidence has been heard that the prosecution and its agents at one time possessed a videotape of the alleged drug sale occurring on November 17, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may assume that such evidence would have been unfavorable to the prosecution only if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) The prosecution and its agents negligently destroyed or caused the evidence to be destroyed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) The prosecution and its agents caused the evidence to be destroyed in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p>The government says that this claim is subject only to plain error review because no objection was made after the court charged the jury. <i>Compare</i> Fed.

R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2), (c) (allowing objection before closing arguments and jury instructions to preserve appellate rights). We bypass the government's waiver argument because the refusal to give the charge was not error at all.</p>\n<p>A \"spoliation\" instruction, allowing an adverse inference, is commonly appropriate in both civil and criminal cases where there is evidence from which a reasonable jury might conclude that evidence favorable to one side was destroyed by the other. 4 L. Sand et al., <i>Modern Federal Jury Instructions</i> ยง 75.01 (instruction 75-7), at 75-16 to -18 (2010). The burden is upon the party seeking the instruction to establish such evidence. 4 Sand et al., <i>supra,</i> ยง 75.01, at 75-18; <i>United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199845\"><a href=\"/opinion/199845/united-states-v-lopez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span> (2002).</p>\n<p>In general, the instruction usually makes sense only where the evidence permits a finding of bad faith destruction; ordinarily, <i>negligent</i> destruction would not support the logical inference that the evidence was favorable to the defendant. 4 Sand et al., <i>supra,</i> ยง 75.01, at 75-17. But the case law is not uniform in the culpability needed for the instruction<sup>[5]</sup> and, anyway, unusual circumstances or even other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> policies might warrant exceptions. Consider, for example, negligent destruction of a particular piece of evidence likely to be exculpatory or routine destruction of a class of such evidenceยneither variation being present here.</p>\n<p>In all events, above all else an instruction must make sense in the context of the evidence, and no adverse-inference instruction would make sense here. The routine erasure of a video surveillance tape by the Manchester Police Department after much time had elapsed without an arrest creates no inference that the tape was destroyed because it contained evidence favorable to the defendant. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pimentel v. Jacobsen Fishing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197139\"><a href=\"/opinion/197139/pimentel-v-the-jacobsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 640 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996) (finding a district court's refusal to draw an adverse inference from an inadvertent destruction of evidence to be neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, this explanation of what happened rests on Robles' testimony, but it was given under oath and was not implausible. If Laurent's counsel seriously doubted the explanation, he could have said why and pressed unequivocally for an opportunity to conduct discovery about it. He did neither and, given the dismissal of the count in question, his course was hardly unreasonable: nothing suggested that the police had erased this particular tape for any reason beyond the passage of time.</p>\n<p>Laurent next argues that the district court should have granted his motions to suppressยon two different groundsย the evidence seized and Laurent's statements made upon his August 22, 2007, arrest. The first is that the arrest warrant issued on March 26, 2007, was tainted by Robles' affidavit stating that Frenchie lived at 196 Lowell Street when in fact (Laurent says) she believed Frenchie resided out of state and used 196 Lowell Street as a base for drug operations.</p>\n<p>Given Frenchie's observed access to and use of the premises, the discrepancy appears trivial and no basis for a hearing pursuant to <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1978). Further, the arrest warrant was unnecessary and invalidating it would not change the outcome: the arrest was amply supported by probable causeยthe observations of the August 22, 2007, offense by several officers who collectively confirmed that Laurent was the man observed committing that offenseยand was therefore independently valid without the need for a warrant. <i>United States v. Link,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199255\"><a href=\"/opinion/199255/united-states-v-link/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Laurent's second ground for suppression rests on the premise that the officers found the drugs in Laurent's car and not on Laurent's personยa premise that is far from settled.<sup>[6]</sup> He then argues that the officers exceeded the bounds of their authority, under <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Of course, if the drugs were found on Laurent, a full search of his person and not a mere pat down was permitted incident to his lawful arrest. <i>United States v.

Based on the convictions, the amount of drugs and Laurent's criminal history, the court found his total offense level to be 24 and his criminal history category to be IV, yielding a sentence range of 77 to 96 months. The sentence imposed was in the middle of the range. Laurent does not now claim that the range was incorrectly calculated.</p>\n<p>Rather, Laurent requested a lower sentence, arguing among other things that the court should downward depart to mitigate the powder cocaine/crack cocaine sentencing disparity under the guidelines. In refusing this request, the sentencing judge saidยin comments now assailed by Laurentยthat crack cocaine is \"more devious,\" \"more addictive,\" \"more dangerous,\" \"more destructive,\" and \"more devastating to society than powder cocaine\" and that therefore crack cocaine distribution offenses are at \"a higher culpability level.\"</p>\n<p>On this appeal, Laurent claims that in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 97-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court was aware of its option to depart downward on that basis, but declined to exercise it.</p>\n<p>Further, the disparity on which <i>Kimbrough</i> cast doubt was the then-applicable crack-powder sentencing disparity that was particularly extreme, <i>see</i> 552 U.S. at 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
