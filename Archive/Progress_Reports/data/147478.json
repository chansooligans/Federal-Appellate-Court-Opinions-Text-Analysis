George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter E. Rodway on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          May 28, 2010\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.    Defendant-appellant Hussein Al-\n\nRikabi challenges a managerial role enhancement that increased his\n\nguideline sentencing range and, thus, paved the way for a stiffer\n\nsentence. Concluding, as we do, that the adjustment is unsupported\n\nby the record, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n          The procedural setting is mundane.     Following a short\n\ntrial in March of 2008, a jury convicted the appellant of one count\n\nof conspiracy to possess narcotics (crack cocaine) with intent to\n\ndistribute and two subsumed specific-offense counts. See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 846.     A two-day sentencing hearing concluded on\n\nOctober 15, 2008.    In calculating the guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR), the court augmented the base offense level by two levels,\n\nfinding that the appellant had exercised managerial authority over\n\nanother participant in the criminal activity.   See USSG §3B1.1(c).\n\nThis adjusted offense level, combined with the appellant's criminal\n\nhistory category (I), yielded a GSR of 151-188 months.   The court\n\nimposed a 151-month incarcerative sentence.\n\n          Against this backdrop, we turn to the record (the court\n\nreceived no new role-in-the-offense evidence at sentencing but,\n\nrather, relied on evidence adduced at trial).   The record reveals\n\nthat the appellant supplied drugs to Dioseline Gabelino, who then\n\nsold them to an undercover agent (UA).1   The evidence relevant to\n\n\n\n     1\n       Gabelino was indicted along with the appellant, but they\nwere not tried together.\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe issue on appeal is limited to recordings of meetings and\n\nintercepted telephone calls, trial testimony of the appellant and\n\nUA, and officers' observations made during ongoing surveillances of\n\nthe actual sales.\n\n           This evidence reflected two transactions, both occurring\n\nin the summer of 2007; one took place on July 25 and the other on\n\nAugust 17.    The genesis and logistics of those transactions are\n\ncentral to our inquiry.\n\n           On July 25, UA approached Gabelino and sought to buy $700\n\nworth of crack.   Because Gabelino did not have a sufficient supply\n\nof drugs on hand, she contacted the appellant.    The pair arranged\n\nto meet.   Transcripts of the calls made to set up the meeting show\n\nthat Gabelino asked for a half-ounce of crack, told the appellant\n\nto call her back because she was busy, called again to ascertain\n\nthe appellant's whereabouts, and finally agreed to meet him at a\n\nlocation that he suggested (a parking lot).\n\n           Later, the two met and got into a car with UA.       The\n\nappellant produced two bags of crack and gave them to Gabelino, who\n\nhanded them to UA.     UA paid the appellant, who kept the whole\n\npayment.     After the transaction was fully consummated, UA paid\n\nGabelino a $50 fee for arranging the sale.\n\n           The second sale proceeded in a somewhat similar manner.\n\nGabelino received a call from UA, who asked for $3,000 worth of\n\ncrack (a dollar amount that UA subsequently reduced to $1,500). To\n\n\n                                -3-\n\ffill the order, Gabelino contacted the appellant.            The two haggled\n\nover   the   quantity   of   crack   to    be   delivered.    The   appellant\n\nsuggested that they rendezvous at a particular place.               Gabelino\n\ninsisted that they put off any meeting, saying that she would\n\ncontact the appellant when she was ready.            The appellant told her\n\nthat she could call him at any time.\n\n             Eventually, a meeting was arranged.             Gabelino and UA\n\ndrove to the agreed site — a supermarket — to join the appellant.\n\nWhen the appellant was late, Gabelino called him twice to find out\n\nwhere he was.     After the appellant made his belated entrance, he\n\nand Gabelino met inside the supermarket.                At that time, the\n\nappellant swapped a quantity of crack for cash that UA had given to\n\nGabelino.     The appellant pocketed the cash.\n\n             Gabelino then approached UA (who was standing nearby),\n\nopened her purse, and allowed him to take the contraband.             UA paid\n\nGabelino $100 for facilitating the purchase.\n\n             The appellant testified at trial, but he was not queried\n\nabout the nature of his relationship with Gabelino.                  UA also\n\ntestified; he was not asked about the relationship between Gabelino\n\nand the appellant.      Gabelino did not testify.        The recordings of\n\ncalls and conversations touched obliquely on that relationship but\n\nwere not in any way definitive.           No other evidence shed any light\n\non either the relationship between Gabelino and the appellant or\n\ntheir relative status.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) stated,\n\nin an essentially conclusory fashion, that the appellant \"held a\n\nmanagerial role over . . . Dioseline Gabelino.\"      The probation\n\ndepartment reasoned that \"Gabelino acted as a 'go-between' for the\n\n[appellant] and the buyer\" and that \"Gabelino took direction\" from\n\nthe appellant.   In this regard, the probation department attached\n\nweight to the fact that the appellant \"retained the entire profits\n\ngenerated from the transactions.\"\n\n          The sentencing court recognized the narrowness of the\n\nevidentiary base, but it nevertheless found a managerial role\n\nadjustment appropriate.   In making this determination, the court\n\nstated that it took into account \"the evidence heard at trial, [the\n\nappellant's] direction to Gabelino, how she was to accomplish her\n\npart of the transaction[s], and the nature of their participation\n\nwith each other where he was clearly in command.\"     And like the\n\nprobation department, the court looked to the \"division of the\n\nproceeds\" as a telltale factor.\n\n          The issue anent the validity of the enhancement is\n\nsquarely joined.   In the court below, the appellant persistently\n\nobjected to it. On appeal, he renews that objection, continuing to\n\nargue that the enhancement is not supported by the evidence.    We\n\nreview factual determinations made by a sentencing court for clear\n\nerror.   United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc).\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fWhere,    as    here,    the    finding    involves    the   reasonableness       of\n\ninferences       drawn   from    an   essentially      undisputed    nucleus      of\n\noperative facts, the clear-error standard applies.                    See United\n\nStates v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1997); Cruz, 120 F.3d\n\nat 3.\n\n               The pertinent guideline prescribes a two-level upward\n\nrole-in-the-offense        adjustment      for   any   offender     who   \"was    an\n\norganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\"\n\ninvolving one to three other participants.               USSG §3B1.1(c).         The\n\nenhancement, therefore, has two elements; to warrant its use, the\n\nsentencing court must supportably find that (i) the criminal\n\nactivity involved at least two, but fewer than five, complicit\n\nindividuals (the defendant included); and (ii) in committing the\n\noffense, the defendant exercised control over, managed, organized,\n\nor superintended the activities of at least one other participant.\n\nCruz, 120 F.3d at 3; United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 616\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               The government bears the burden of proving that an upward\n\nrole-in-the-offense adjustment is appropriate in a given case.\n\nCruz, 120 F.3d at 3.            It must carry that burden by preponderant\n\nevidence.       Id.\n\n               In this instance, the first element needed for the\n\nenhancement is present.          The record shows with conspicuous clarity\n\nthat    fewer    than    five   miscreants,      including   Gabelino     and    the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fappellant, perpetrated the crimes.         Consequently, the lens of our\n\ninquiry narrows to focus on the element of control.\n\n          Drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most\n\nfavorable to the challenged finding, the scenario here is not one\n\nin which the government can be said to have carried its burden.         To\n\nbegin, the record is notable for what it does not contain.           There\n\nis no proof of orders given and obeyed.       There is no proof that the\n\nappellant paid Gabelino for her services.          There is no proof of\n\neither a committed relationship or an exclusive course of dealing.2\n\nIn fine, there is no proof that Gabelino was either subservient to\n\nthe appellant or subject to his hegemony.\n\n          What evidence there is suggests that Gabelino acted as a\n\nfree agent, dealing with the appellant as any street-level seller\n\nwould deal with a source of supply.        While sellers sometimes work\n\nfor their suppliers in the drug trade, that is not an inevitable\n\nconcomitant of such a relationship — any more than, say, a hot dog\n\nvendor on a street corner necessarily would be thought to be a\n\nminion of Oscar Mayer.\n\n          The   case   law   makes   pellucid   that   more   than   shared\n\ncriminal activity is needed to give rise to a managerial role\n\nadjustment.   See, e.g., United States v. Picanso, 333 F.3d 21, 24\n\n(1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1220-21\n\n\n     2\n       Indeed, once the authorities apprehended the appellant,\nGabelino simply called another supplier to enable her to satisfy\nUA's continuing requests to purchase crack.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f(1st Cir. 1990).    There must be some additional fact or facts that\n\nwill permit a factfinder to draw a founded inference about the\n\nnature of the particular relationship.    In the absence of any such\n\ndata, the government cannot be said to have carried the devoir of\n\npersuasion as to control.\n\n          That Gabelino and the appellant cooperated to arrange\n\nmeeting times and places does not furnish the missing link.    Each\n\ncollaborated when it seemed to his or her advantage to do so, but\n\nnothing about this collaboration shows that one managed, directed,\n\nor supervised the other.      See Picanso, 333 F.3d at 24; United\n\nStates v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993).     The same\n\ncan be said of the fact that the two agreed, on a sale-by-sale\n\nbasis, to drug quantity and pricing.   See United States v. Flores-\n\nDe-Jesús, 569 F.3d 8, 35 (1st Cir. 2009); Picanso, 333 F.3d at 24.\n\n          In the last analysis, the sparse record leaves too much\n\nto guesswork.      Although the record shows that Gabelino and the\n\nappellant were working hand in glove, it does not contain any\n\nsignificantly probative evidence of their relative status on which\n\na sentencing court could ground a supportable inference that the\n\nformer was subordinate to the latter in a chain of command.     See\n\nUnited States v. Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 464 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The sentencing court's contrary finding is unsupported.\n\nAlthough the court said that Gabelino took \"direction\" from the\n\nappellant, the record is utterly barren of any evidence to that\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\feffect. What little evidence there is points the opposite way.           It\n\nwas Gabelino, independently, who discovered the customer and agreed\n\nto furnish him with crack. It was the customer, not the appellant,\n\nwho remunerated Gabelino for her services.\n\n          The sentencing court also said, without elaboration, that\n\n\"how [Gabelino] was to accomplish her part of the transaction[s]\n\nand the nature of [the parties'] participation with each other\"\n\ndemonstrated that the appellant \"was clearly in command.\"               The\n\nevidence does not support this characterization.           Gabelino and the\n\nappellant each performed particular steps in the criminal pavane,\n\nand the allocation of functions is not probative of a relationship\n\nin which one actor was directed by the other.       Cf. United States v.\n\nGarcía-Pastrana,   584   F.3d   351,   393   (1st   Cir.    2009)   (finding\n\nsufficient evidence of managerial role where defendant recruited\n\ncodefendants).\n\n          Fairly viewed, the conversations between the principals\n\nindicate that Gabelino did not answer to the appellant.                 For\n\nexample, Gabelino did not hesitate to tell the appellant that she\n\nwas busy and would contact him when she was ready to proceed with\n\ntheir business. Similarly, she did not hesitate to haggle with him\n\nover quantities.   These are hardly the responses that one would\n\nexpect a subordinate to make to the person in charge of a joint\n\nenterprise.   See Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d at 464.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          To be sure, the probation department suggested in the PSI\n\nReport that Gabelino acted as a \"go-between.\" But that description\n\nhas very little bearing on the issue of control.           Even if the\n\nappellation is an accurate descriptor, it begs the question.\n\nWhether or not Gabelino acted as a go-between, there is no evidence\n\nthat she acted under the management, supervision, or control of the\n\nappellant.\n\n          This leaves what the district court called \"the division\n\nof proceeds\" — an apparent reference to the appellant's retention\n\nof UA's payments.     But there was no \"division\" of those proceeds;\n\nfor aught that appears, the appellant kept them all.       Gabelino, on\n\nthe other hand, was paid fees directly by her buyer.             That two\n\nwrongdoers are compensated differently for their respective roles\n\nin a shared criminal activity may in some situations be significant\n\nas to their relative status.      See, e.g., Savoie, 985 F.2d at 616.\n\nHere, however, there is no evidence of the appellant's profit\n\nmargins and, thus, no sound basis for drawing an inference that\n\nrelative compensation is an indicium of control.3\n\n          We   need    go   no   further.   In   the   absence    of   any\n\nsignificantly probative evidence, direct or circumstantial, about\n\nthe nature of the hierarchical relationship, if any, between the\n\n\n     3\n       The government's suggestion that the appellant took all the\nproceeds because of a prior debt that Gabelino owed to him, Gov't\nBr. at 29, rests on a premise that is not verifiable from the\nrecord. In all events, the district court made no finding to that\neffect.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fappellant and Gabelino, the finding that the appellant occupied a\n\nmanagerial role is clearly erroneous. Without that finding and the\n\nconsequent enhancement, the appellant's sentence cannot stand.\n\nThus, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

We review factual determinations made by a sentencing court for clear error. <i>United States v. Mateo,</i> 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc). Where, as here, the finding involves the reasonableness of inferences drawn from an essentially undisputed nucleus of operative facts, the clear-error standard applies. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McDonald,</i> 121 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3.</p>\n<p>The pertinent guideline prescribes a two-level upward role-in-the-offense adjustment for any offender who \"was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\" involving one to three other participants. USSG § 3B1.1(c). The enhancement, therefore, has two elements; to warrant its use, the sentencing court must supportably find that (i) the criminal activity involved at least two, but fewer than five, complicit individuals (the defendant included); and (ii) in committing the offense, the defendant exercised control over, managed, organized, or superintended the activities of at least one other participant. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3; <i>United States v.

Although the court said that Gabelino took \"direction\" from the appellant, the record is utterly barren of any evidence to that effect. What little evidence there is points the opposite way. It was Gabelino, independently, who discovered the customer and agreed to furnish him with crack. It was the customer, not the appellant, who remunerated Gabelino for her services.</p>\n<p>The sentencing court also said, without elaboration, that \"how [Gabelino] was to accomplish her part of the transaction[s] and the nature of [the parties'] participation with each other\" demonstrated that the appellant \"was clearly in command.\" The evidence does not support this characterization. Gabelino and the appellant each performed particular steps in the criminal pavane, and the allocation of functions is not probative of a relationship in which one actor was directed by the other. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. García-Pastrana,</i> 584 F.3d 351, 393 (1st Cir.2009) (finding sufficient evidence of managerial role where defendant recruited codefendants).</p>\n<p>Fairly viewed, the conversations between the principals indicate that Gabelino did not answer to the appellant. For example, Gabelino did not hesitate to tell the appellant that she was busy and would contact him when she was ready to proceed with their business. Similarly, she did not hesitate to haggle with him over quantities. These are hardly the responses that one would expect a subordinate to make to the person in charge of a joint enterprise. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Paulino,</i> 488 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the probation department suggested in the PSI Report that Gabelino acted as a \"go-between.\" But that description has very little bearing on the issue of control. Even if the appellation is an accurate descriptor, it begs the question. Whether or not Gabelino acted as a go-between, there is no evidence that she acted under the management, supervision, or control of the appellant.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> This leaves what the district court called \"the division of proceeds\"an apparent reference to the appellant's retention of UA's payments. But there was no \"division\" of those proceeds; for aught that appears, the appellant kept them all. Gabelino, on the other hand, was paid fees directly by her buyer. That two wrongdoers are compensated differently for their respective roles in a shared criminal activity may in some situations be significant as to their relative status. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Savoie,</i> 985 F.2d at 616.

In the absence of any significantly probative evidence, direct or circumstantial, about the nature of the hierarchical relationship, if any, between the appellant and Gabelino, the finding that the appellant occupied a managerial role is clearly erroneous.

Rodway on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Hussein Al-Rikabi challenges a managerial role enhancement that increased his guideline sentencing range and, thus, paved the way for a stiffer sentence. Concluding, as we do, that the adjustment is unsupported by the record, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p>The procedural setting is mundane. Following a short trial in March of 2008, a jury convicted the appellant of one count of conspiracy to possess narcotics (crack cocaine) with intent to distribute and two subsumed specific-offense counts. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846. A two-day sentencing hearing concluded on October 15, 2008. In calculating the guideline sentencing range (GSR), the court augmented the base offense level by two levels, finding that the appellant had exercised managerial authority over another participant in the criminal activity. <i>See</i> USSG § 3B1.1(c). This adjusted offense level, combined with the appellant's criminal history category (I), yielded a GSR of 151-188 months. The court imposed a 151-month incarcerative sentence.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, we turn to the record (the court received no new role-in-the-offense evidence at sentencing but, rather, relied on evidence adduced at trial). The record reveals that the appellant supplied drugs to Dioseline Gabelino, who then sold them to an undercover agent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> (UA).<sup>[1]</sup> The evidence relevant to the issue on appeal is limited to recordings of meetings and intercepted telephone calls, trial testimony of the appellant and UA, and officers' observations made during ongoing surveillances of the actual sales.</p>\n<p>This evidence reflected two transactions, both occurring in the summer of 2007; one took place on July 25 and the other on August 17. The genesis and logistics of those transactions are central to our inquiry.</p>\n<p>On July 25, UA approached Gabelino and sought to buy $700 worth of crack. Because Gabelino did not have a sufficient supply of drugs on hand, she contacted the appellant. The pair arranged to meet. Transcripts of the calls made to set up the meeting show that Gabelino asked for a half-ounce of crack, told the appellant to call her back because she was busy, called again to ascertain the appellant's whereabouts, and finally agreed to meet him at a location that he suggested (a parking lot).</p>\n<p>Later, the two met and got into a car with UA. The appellant produced two bags of crack and gave them to Gabelino, who handed them to UA. UA paid the appellant, who kept the whole payment. After the transaction was fully consummated, UA paid Gabelino a $50 fee for arranging the sale.</p>\n<p>The second sale proceeded in a somewhat similar manner. Gabelino received a call from UA, who asked for $3,000 worth of crack (a dollar amount that UA subsequently reduced to $1,500). To fill the order, Gabelino contacted the appellant. The two haggled over the quantity of crack to be delivered. The appellant suggested that they rendezvous at a particular place. Gabelino insisted that they put off any meeting, saying that she would contact the appellant when she was ready. The appellant told her that she could call him at any time.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a meeting was arranged. Gabelino and UA drove to the agreed sitea supermarketto join the appellant. When the appellant was late, Gabelino called him twice to find out where he was. After the appellant made his belated entrance, he and Gabelino met inside the supermarket. At that time, the appellant swapped a quantity of crack for cash that UA had given to Gabelino. The appellant pocketed the cash.</p>\n<p>Gabelino then approached UA (who was standing nearby), opened her purse, and allowed him to take the contraband. UA paid Gabelino $100 for facilitating the purchase.</p>\n<p>The appellant testified at trial, but he was not queried about the nature of his relationship with Gabelino. UA also testified; he was not asked about the relationship between Gabelino and the appellant. Gabelino did not testify. The recordings of calls and conversations touched obliquely on that relationship but were not in any way definitive. No other evidence shed any light on either the relationship between Gabelino and the appellant or their relative status.</p>\n<p>The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) stated, in an essentially conclusory fashion, that the appellant \"held a managerial role over . . . Dioseline Gabelino.\" The probation department reasoned that \"Gabelino acted as a `go-between' for the [appellant] and the buyer\" and that \"Gabelino took direction\" from the appellant. In this regard, the probation department attached weight to the fact that the appellant \"retained the entire profits generated from the transactions.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> The sentencing court recognized the narrowness of the evidentiary base, but it nevertheless found a managerial role adjustment appropriate. In making this determination, the court stated that it took into account \"the evidence heard at trial, [the appellant's] direction to Gabelino, how she was to accomplish her part of the transaction[s], and the nature of their participation with each other where he was clearly in command.\" And like the probation department, the court looked to the \"division of the proceeds\" as a telltale factor.</p>\n<p>The issue anent the validity of the enhancement is squarely joined. In the court below, the appellant persistently objected to it. On appeal, he renews that objection, continuing to argue that the enhancement is not supported by the evidence. We review factual determinations made by a sentencing court for clear error. <i>United States v. Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199671\"><a href=\"/opinion/199671/united-states-v-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

Where, as here, the finding involves the reasonableness of inferences drawn from an essentially undisputed nucleus of operative facts, the clear-error standard applies. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McDonald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3.</p>\n<p>The pertinent guideline prescribes a two-level upward role-in-the-offense adjustment for any offender who \"was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\" involving one to three other participants. USSG § 3B1.1(c). The enhancement, therefore, has two elements; to warrant its use, the sentencing court must supportably find that (i) the criminal activity involved at least two, but fewer than five, complicit individuals (the defendant included); and (ii) in committing the offense, the defendant exercised control over, managed, organized, or superintended the activities of at least one other participant. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3; <i>United States v. Savoie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 616 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>The government bears the burden of proving that an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment is appropriate in a given case. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 3.
