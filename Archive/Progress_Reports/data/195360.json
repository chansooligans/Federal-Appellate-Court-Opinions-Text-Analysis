Mullen,\n                                                              \nSenior  Assistant Attorney  General, Civil  Bureau, on  brief for\nappellees.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per  Curiam.      Plaintiff, pro  se,  appeals  the\n                                              \n\ndismissal  of his civil rights complaint for failure to state\n\na  claim  under 42  U.S.C.     1983,  1985(3).   Plaintiff is\n\ncurrently  incarcerated  at the  New  Hampshire State  Prison\n\nfollowing  his   conviction  for certain  sex  offenses.   He\n\nchallenges the validity of  his conviction, claiming that New\n\nHampshire's  sexual assault laws are unconstitutional because\n\nthey  permit  a  conviction  to rest  solely  on  the alleged\n\nvictim's  uncorroborated  testimony  that a  crime  occurred.\n\nPlaintiff seeks both equitable and monetary relief.  He names\n\nas defendants the  State of New Hampshire, the  Governor, the\n\nCheshire County Commissioner, the Keene Police Department and\n\nhis own trial attorney. \n\n          Since  plaintiff is  proceeding in  forma pauperis,\n\nthe  magistrate  undertook   a  preliminary  review  of   the\n\ncomplaint  prior  to completing  service.   See  28  U.S.C.  \n                                               \n\n1915(d).   The magistrate construed the  complaint as seeking\n\nboth  habeas  relief  and  damages.   He  identified  several\n\ndeficiencies  in the  statement  of the  claims and  afforded\n\nplaintiff an opportunity  to amend the complaint to  cure the\n\ndefects, or face a recommended dismissal for failure to state\n\na  claim.   See Forte v.  Sullivan, 935  F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991); Purvis v. Ponte, 929 F.2d 822, 826-27 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                      \n\nPlaintiff filed  an objection to  the report, and  an amended\n\ncomplaint.   The  amendments added factual  allegations about\n\n                             -2-\n\nplaintiff's criminal case  but did not  cure the defects  the\n\nmagistrate had  noted  in  his     1983  claims.    Plaintiff\n\ninsisted that he  did not  intend his equitable  claims as  a\n\nhabeas petition;  and emphasized  that he intended  to assert\n\nclaims under both sections 1983  and 1985(3).  The magistrate\n\nonce  again  reviewed  the  complaint,  observing  additional\n\ndeficiencies  in  the  claims  under     1985,  and  afforded\n\nplaintiff yet  another opportunity  to amend.   Plaintiff did\n\nnot  file  a  second amendment,  but  again  objected  to the\n\nmagistrate's  report.   After  reviewing the  objection,  the\n\ndistrict  court   accepted   the  magistrate's   report   and\n\nrecommendation, dismissing the complaint.   \n\n          Plaintiff states  that he  is currently  pursuing a\n\nmotion to  set aside the verdict  and for a new  trial in his\n\nstate criminal  case, as well  as a  state habeas  petition.1\n\nIt  is thus apparent that  his equitable claims were properly\n\ndismissed  as an  attempt  to circumvent  the federal  habeas\n\ncorpus exhaustion  rule.  Guerro  v. Mulhearn, 498  F.2d 1249\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1974).    Habeas corpus  is  the sole  avenue  for\n\nseeking  release  from  confinement  based  on  an  allegedly\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiff informed the district  court of the pendency of\nhis   state  habeas   petition  in   his  objection   to  the\nmagistrate's initial report and in his amended complaint.  In\nthis court he  has filed  a \"Motion  to Introduce  Supporting\nEvidence\" in which he additionally alleges the pendency  of a\nmotion to  set aside the verdict  and for a new  trial in his\nstate criminal case.  \n\n                             -3-\n\nunlawful conviction.  Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 490\n                                          \n\n(1973). \n\n          While ordinarily  civil rights monetary  claims are\n\nstayed   during  the  pendency  of  parallel  state  criminal\n\nproceedings, they, too, may be dismissed for failure to state\n\na claim where the ground for dismissal does not affect issues\n\nthat must be first decided by the state court.  Accord Duncan\n                                                             \n\nv. Gunter, 15 F.3d 989 (10th Cir.  1994) (affirming dismissal\n         \n\non  grounds   which  need  not  be  first  decided  in  state\n\nproceedings);  cf. Bettencourt  v.  Board of  Registration in\n                                                             \n\nMedicine, 904 F.2d  772, 781 (1st Cir. 1990)  (observing that\n        \n\nDeakins v. Monaghan, 484  U.S. 193 (1988) ordinarily requires\n                   \n\na stay  of   1983 monetary claims which cannot be asserted in\n\nparallel state licensing proceeding, but  affirming dismissal\n\nof  claims where  there  were independent  legal grounds  for\n\ndismissal).  \n\n          Plaintiff's monetary claims were properly dismissed\n\nfor reasons which do not encroach upon any issues that may be\n\nraised  in the state proceedings.   The    1985(3) claims are\n\ninfirm  because plaintiff alleges no facts showing that he is\n\na member of a protected class, a requirement to found a claim\n\nunder that statute.   See Bray  v. Alexandria Women's  Health\n                                                             \n\nClinic,  113  S.   Ct.  753  (1993).     The  claims  against\n      \n\nplaintiff's state trial attorney are infirm because there are\n\nno  facts suggesting that the  attorney acted \"under color of\n\n                             -4-\n\nstate law,\"  as required by    1983.  Polk  County v. Dodson,\n                                                            \n\n454 U.S. 312 (1981) (public defender is not a state actor for\n\npurposes  of   1983); Malachowski v. Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 710\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.)  (court-appointed private  attorney  does not  act\n\nunder  \"color of  state  law\"), cert.  denied,  479 U.S.  828\n                                             \n\n(1986).    The  damages  claims  against  the  State and  the\n\nGovernor, in  his official  capacity, are barred  by Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.    See Will  v. Michigan  Dep't of  State\n                                                             \n\nPolice,  491 U.S.  58, 70-71  &amp; n.10  (1989).   The remaining\n      \n\nclaims against the various  state, county and local officials\n\nare   infirm  because  public  officials  are  shielded  from\n\nliability  for  civil  damages  under    1983  \"unless  their\n\nconduct  was unreasonable  in  light  of clearly  established\n\nlaw.\"   Elder v. Holloway, 114  S. Ct. 1019 (1994);  see also\n                                                             \n\nHarlow  v. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800, 818  (1982) (qualified\n                     \n\nimmunity extends  to conduct which \"does  not violate clearly\n\nestablished  statutory or  constitutional  rights of  which a\n\nreasonable person would have known\").  Aside from boilerplate\n\nallegations  of \"conspiracy\",  plaintiff  alleges  only  that\n\nthese officials followed established state law in prosecuting\n\nthe charges against him.   Thus regardless of the  outcome of\n\nhis constitutional challenge  to the  state's law,  plaintiff\n\ncannot  recover civil  damages from  these officials  for the\n\nconduct alleged.     \n\n                             -5-\n\n          Accordingly,   plaintiff's  \"Motion   to  Introduce\n\nSupporting  Evidence is  granted, and  the judgment  below is\n                                \n\naffirmed.\n         \n\n                             -6-\n",

Mulhearn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"320118\"><a href=\"/opinion/320118/thomas-a-guerro-v-roger-f-mulhearn-ralph-f-andrews-v-kathy-decote/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1974).  Habeas corpus is the sole avenue for seeking release from confinement based on an allegedly unlawful conviction.   Preiser v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 490 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While ordinarily civil rights monetary claims are stayed during the pendency of parallel state criminal proceedings, they, too, may be dismissed for failure to state a claim where the ground for dismissal does not affect issues that must be first decided by the state court.  Accord Duncan v.  Gunter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661816\"><a href=\"/opinion/661816/waller-s-duncan-jr-and-rocky-l-pearson-chris-badger-thomas-chippewa/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 1994) (affirming dismissal on grounds which need not be first decided in state proceedings);  cf.   Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in Medicine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542856\"><a href=\"/opinion/542856/paul-e-bettencourt-md-v-board-of-registration-in-medicine-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 781 (1st Cir. 1990) (observing that  Deakins v.

The Sec. 1985(3) claims are infirm because plaintiff alleges no facts showing that he is a member of a protected class, a requirement to found a claim under that statute.   See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span> (1993).  The claims against plaintiff's state trial attorney are infirm because there are no facts suggesting that the attorney acted \"under color of state law,\" as required by Sec. 1983.   Polk County v. Dodson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110589\"><a href=\"/opinion/110589/polk-county-v-dodson/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (1981) (public defender is not a state actor for purposes of Sec. 1983);   Malachowski v. Keene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468093\"><a href=\"/opinion/468093/henry-malachowski-and-julia-malachowski-v-city-of-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 710 (1st Cir.)

The damages claims against the State and the Governor, in his official capacity, are barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See Will v.  Michigan Dep't of State Police, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 70-71 &amp; n. 10 (1989).  The remaining claims against the various state, county and local officials are infirm because public officials are shielded from liability for civil damages under Sec. 1983 \"unless their conduct was unreasonable in light of clearly established law.\"   Elder v. Holloway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112933\"><a href=\"/opinion/112933/elder-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Aside from boilerplate allegations of \"conspiracy\", plaintiff alleges only that these officials followed established state law in prosecuting the charges against him.  Thus regardless of the outcome of his constitutional challenge to the state's law, plaintiff cannot recover civil damages from these officials for the conduct alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, plaintiff's \"Motion to Introduce Supporting Evidence is granted, and the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff informed the district court of the pendency of his state habeas petition in his objection to the magistrate's initial report and in his amended complaint.
