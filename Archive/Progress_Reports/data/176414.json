Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Thompson, Selya and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael S. Gardener, with whom Laurence A. Schoen, Mintz,\nLevin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., Michael A. Collora,\nIngrid S. Martin, and Dwyer & Collora, LLP were on brief, for\nappellants.\n     Matthew H. Feinberg, with whom Matthew A. Kamholtz, Daniel\nKlubock, and Feinberg & Kamholtz, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            October 1, 2010\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.         This appeal requires us to sort\n\nthrough a complicated set of commercial machinations and evaluate\n\nthe soundness of an equitable accounting through which the lower\n\ncourt   divided   the   surplus   proceeds      of   a   multi-million-dollar\n\nforeclosure sale.       To solve this conundrum, we must answer three\n\nloosely related questions. The first concerns the applicability of\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel, the second concerns the way in\n\nwhich the methodology for calculating the equity of redemption fits\n\nwithin the framework of a judicial accounting, and the third\n\nconcerns the propriety of a post-trial joinder of additional\n\ndefendants.   After careful consideration of these questions, we\n\nreject the district court's proposed application of the doctrine of\n\njudicial   estoppel     but   uphold   its   treatment    of   the   equity   of\n\nredemption and its joinder order.            When all is said and done, we\n\naffirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the judgment, and remand\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Although there is a long, convoluted, and sometimes\n\nMachiavellian history involving the protagonists, we relate here\n\nonly those facts relevant to the issues presented on appeal.                  We\n\nsupplement this account in connection with our discussion of\n\nparticular issues.       Throughout, we accept the district court's\n\nfactual findings to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous.\n\nLimone v. United States, 579 F.3d 79, 94 (1st Cir. 2009); Cumpiano\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fv. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990); Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(a).\n\n          Michael Perry and Stephen Yellin each hold a fifty\n\npercent interest in Condominium Housing, Incorporated (CHI), which\n\nowned a large apartment complex in Boston, Massachusetts, known as\n\n\"the Fenmore.\"   CHI purchased the Fenmore from Harold Brown in\n\n1985.   The purchase price included two promissory notes, with an\n\naggregate face value of approximately $11,000,000 (the Notes),\n\nexecuted by Perry and Yellin as co-makers.    The Notes were secured\n\nby first and second mortgages on the property.\n\n          Over time, Perry and Yellin made payments on the Notes.\n\nBut when the Boston real estate market cratered in the late 1980s,\n\nthey defaulted on several obligations, including not only the Notes\n\nbut also an array of loans from their primary lender, Capitol Bank\n\n(which, among other things, held a third mortgage on the Fenmore).\n\nBy 1990, Perry and Yellin owed Capitol Bank more than $7,000,000.\n\nThey negotiated a settlement with the bank in July of that year,\n\nbut the settlement proved to be illusory.     The bank subsequently\n\nrepudiated it, and Perry and Yellin were forced to sue for specific\n\nperformance in a Massachusetts state court.\n\n          During the currency of that suit, the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Capitol Bank as its receiver\n\nand liquidating agent.   The FDIC sought to collect Perry's and\n\nYellin's indebtedness to the bank, claiming that they owed roughly\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f$19,000,000 in principal and accrued interest on various loans. As\n\npart of its collection effort, the FDIC disavowed the earlier\n\nsettlement and, in January of 1999, filed an amended counterclaim\n\nin the state court suit.\n\n            The       amended   counterclaim       named   as   defendants    Perry,\n\nYellin,   and     a    number     of    their    relatives.     These      additional\n\ndefendants (whom we shall call the \"Perry Parties\" and the \"Yellin\n\nParties\") were allegedly involved in Perry's and Yellin's real\n\nestate enterprises as \"straws.\"                 In due season, the FDIC removed\n\nthe state court action to the federal district court.                         See 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B).\n\n            Brown's fortunes also had been adversely affected by the\n\nslumping real estate market.               In 1991, he filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy proceedings dragged on and, in August of 1996, he\n\nsubmitted   an        affidavit    to    the    bankruptcy    court   in    which   he\n\nrepresented that the Notes had an unpaid balance of $902,662 and\n\nwere uncollectible. The bankruptcy court granted Brown a discharge\n\nfrom bankruptcy in September of 1996 and permitted him to retain\n\nownership of the Notes.\n\n            CHI went into bankruptcy in April of 1996.                  After Brown\n\nemerged from his own bankruptcy, he intervened in CHI's bankruptcy\n\nand requested relief from the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362, so\n\nthat he could foreclose on the Fenmore. Brown represented that the\n\nNotes had a principal balance of $902,662 and past-due interest of\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f$950,620.      The bankruptcy court granted Brown's motion to lift the\n\nstay in December of 1996.             Instead of foreclosing, however, Brown\n\nagreed    to    sell    the     Notes       to   Yellin     for    $950,000.            Yellin\n\neffectuated this purchase behind Perry's back and through a straw:\n\nSteven Blum, in his capacity as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust.\n\nThe sole beneficiary of the trust was North Shore Renewal, Inc., a\n\nshell corporation wholly owned by Yellin's wife, Elaine.                               Yellin,\n\nacting    through      Blum,    then    took       control    of    the    Fenmore       as    a\n\nmortgagee-in-possession and began collecting rents.\n\n               In June of 1997, Perry, on behalf of CHI, sued the\n\nYellins and Blum, individually and as trustee of Moorings Nominee\n\nTrust, in a Massachusetts state court.                            The suit alleged an\n\nalphabet of wrongdoing, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,\n\nand conversion, stemming from the purchase of the Notes.                                      In\n\nOctober    of    1998,    after       Perry      failed      to    attend       a     pretrial\n\nconference,      the    state       court    dismissed       the    suit       for    want    of\n\nprosecution.       CHI v. Blum, No. 97-3007 (Mass. Dist. Ct. Oct. 7,\n\n1998) (unpublished order).\n\n               In late 1997, Yellin, acting through Blum, commenced\n\nforeclosure proceedings with respect to the Fenmore.                                 The FDIC,\n\nwhich held junior mortgages on the property as the receiver for\n\nCapitol Bank, responded by bringing an action in the federal\n\ndistrict court.          In the action, the FDIC sought to enjoin any\n\nforeclosure      sale.        The    district       court    granted       a    preliminary\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\finjunction blocking the foreclosure sale.    Later, it consolidated\n\nthe action in which it had granted the injunction with the action\n\nthat the FDIC had removed from the state court.\n\n            In 2002, Yellin and the Yellin Parties settled with the\n\nFDIC for $5,000,000.    Under the terms of the settlement, the FDIC\n\npermitted Yellin, acting through Blum, to foreclose on the Fenmore\n\nand use the first $5,000,000 of the foreclosure proceeds to fund\n\nthe settlement.      The district court thereafter dissolved the\n\nexisting injunction and Blum foreclosed on the Fenmore.         The\n\napartment complex was sold at auction for $9,450,000 (ironically,\n\nto Brown).    The FDIC and the Yellin Parties then jointly moved to\n\ndismiss all claims inter sese.     The district court granted that\n\nmotion on June 10, 2002.1\n\n            Following the foreclosure sale, Perry, on behalf of\n\nhimself and CHI, cross-claimed against Blum for an accounting of\n\nboth the foreclosure proceeds and all rents collected between 1996\n\nand 2002.    Perry alleged that, as an equal partner in CHI, he was\n\nentitled to one-half of the Fenmore's equity of redemption.\n\n            In February and March of 2005, the district court held a\n\nbench trial on the cross-claim.    The Notes were secured by first\n\nand second mortgages on the Fenmore, so Blum, as the noteholder and\n\nas a straw for Yellin, had a priority claim to the foreclosure\n\n\n\n     1\n       The FDIC settled separately with the Perry Parties in\nNovember of 2005. The settlement totaled $6,625,000.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fproceeds.       Not surprisingly, then, one of the main issues at trial\n\nconcerned the amount due on the Notes.              Blum contended that\n\n$7,494,435 was due.        Perry contended that the amount due was much\n\nless.        The district court determined that Blum was estopped from\n\nasserting that the amount due was anything other than what Brown,\n\nBlum's predecessor-in-interest, had represented in the bankruptcy\n\ncourt, namely, $1,853,282.        Perry v. Blum (Perry I), No. 99-12194,\n\nslip op. at 30 (D. Mass. Oct. 31, 2008).2          Even though the trial\n\nhad ended years earlier, the court granted Perry's motion to join\n\nthe Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants.         Id., slip op. at 36.\n\n                Before the court actually made a final accounting, Blum\n\nand the Yellins moved for reconsideration of Perry I, arguing that\n\nthe court had erred in applying judicial estoppel and in joining\n\nthe Yellins after trial.         The court denied the motion, Perry v.\n\nBlum (Perry II), No. 99-12194, slip op. at 2 (D. Mass. June 2,\n\n2009). The court then prepared the accounting and entered judgment\n\nfor Perry against Blum and the Yellins in the sum of $4,347,126,\n\nplus        pre-judgment   interest.    The   appendix   to   this   opinion\n\ndelineates the manner in which the court calculated this amount.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       The district court also addressed Perry's argument that the\nNotes were discharged (and, thus, the amount due was zero). The\ncourt held that this argument was barred by res judicata: the\ndismissal of CHI's state court action precluded Perry from\nlitigating the discharged claim. Perry I, slip op. at 20-27. This\nruling is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f            Blum     and   the   Yellins    moved   to   alter   or    amend    the\n\njudgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), protesting that the court had\n\nerred in excluding from its calculation of the equity of redemption\n\nan offset for the $5,000,000 payment that the Yellins had made to\n\nthe FDIC — an offset that would have had the effect of reducing\n\nPerry's award by $2,500,000. The district court denied the motion,\n\nreasoning that it would be inequitable to allow Yellin to settle\n\nhis personal debts by using foreclosure proceeds that otherwise\n\nwould have to be split with Perry.           Perry v. Blum (Perry III), No.\n\n99-12194 (D. Mass. June 18, 2009) (unpublished order).                  Blum and\n\nthe Yellins filed a timely motion of appeal from both the final\n\njudgment and the denial of their Rule 59(e) motion.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            Like a milking stool, this appeal rests on three legs.\n\nThe appellants (Blum and the Yellins) insist that the district\n\ncourt erred in (i) invoking judicial estoppel, (ii) miscalculating\n\nthe   equity    of   redemption,     and    (iii)   adding   the      Yellins    as\n\ndefendants after the trial had ended.               We discuss each of these\n\narguments separately.        Before doing so, however, we pause to make\n\na point about choice of law.\n\n            Due to the FDIC's involvement, this case had its roots in\n\nfederal question jurisdiction.             12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(A); 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.       But the FDIC has departed from the scene, and the\n\nremaining      claims      are   cognizable     only     under     supplemental\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fjurisdiction.    28 U.S.C. § 1367.      Where, as here, a federal court\n\nproceeds under supplemental jurisdiction, it is obliged to apply\n\nfederal    procedural   law   and   state   substantive   law.   Hoyos   v.\n\nTelecorp Commc'ns, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).            To the\n\nextent that procedural issues loom, the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure provide the beacon by which we must steer.\n\n            Most of the components of the appellants' asseverational\n\narray raise substantive questions and, thus, require us to apply\n\nMassachusetts law.      Withal, one of the issues presents a thorny\n\nproblem of classification, which this court has not resolved: Is\n\njudicial estoppel procedural (and, thus, governed by federal law)\n\nor substantive (and, thus, governed by state law)?\n\n            This is an interesting Rubik's cube, but we need not\n\nprovide a definitive answer here.           The parties and the district\n\ncourt all assumed that federal standards of judicial estoppel\n\ngoverned, and the case has been briefed and argued on the same\n\nassumption.     In such circumstances, we may hold the parties to\n\ntheir plausible choice of law, whether or not that choice is\n\ncorrect.    See Thore v. Howe, 466 F.3d 173, 181 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nAlt. Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., 374 F.3d 23, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 2004). We follow that prudential course and apply federal law\n\nin discussing this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f                           A.     Judicial Estoppel.\n\n            The appellants insist that the district court erred in\n\ninvoking judicial estoppel to preclude them from showing that the\n\namount due on the Notes was anything other than what Brown had\n\nrepresented in a prior bankruptcy proceeding.               We review for abuse\n\nof discretion a district court's application of judicial estoppel.\n\nGlobal NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Engl. Inc., 603 F.3d 71, 91 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).       Within that rubric, we accept the trial court's\n\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, see Limone, 579\n\nF.3d at 94; Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152, and evaluate its answers to\n\nabstract questions of law de novo, see San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R.\n\nTel. Co., 612 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2010).                  We treat a material\n\nmistake of law as a per se abuse of discretion.                Rosario-Urdaz v.\n\nRivera-Hernández, 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The doctrine of judicial estoppel is equitable in nature.\n\nIt operates to prevent a litigant from taking a litigation position\n\nthat   is   inconsistent    with     a    litigation   position    successfully\n\nasserted by him in an earlier phase of the same case or in an\n\nearlier court proceeding.          InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134,\n\n144 (1st Cir. 2003).       The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the\n\nintegrity of the judicial process.              It is typically invoked when a\n\nlitigant tries to play fast and loose with the courts.                        New\n\nHampshire    v.   Maine,    532    U.S.    742,    749-50   (2001);   Alt.   Sys.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fConcepts, 374 F.3d at 33; Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema\n\nCorp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           The contours of judicial estoppel are hazy.     But even\n\nthough its elements cannot be reduced to a scientifically precise\n\nformula, New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750, courts generally require\n\nthe presence of three things before introducing the doctrine into\n\na particular case.    First, a party's earlier and later positions\n\nmust be clearly inconsistent. Id.; Alt. Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at\n\n33.   Second, the party must have succeeded in persuading a court to\n\naccept the earlier position.   New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750; Alt.\n\nSys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 33.   Third, the party seeking to assert\n\nthe inconsistent position must stand to derive an unfair advantage\n\nif the new position is accepted by the court.    New Hampshire, 532\n\nU.S. at 751; Alt. Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 33.\n\n           Ordinarily, the party against whom judicial estoppel is\n\ninvoked must be the same party who made the prior (inconsistent)\n\nrepresentation.    See InterGen, 344 F.3d at 144 (explaining that\n\njudicial estoppel \"prevents a litigant from pressing a claim that\n\nis inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant\" in the same\n\nor an earlier proceeding); Brewer v. Madigan, 945 F.2d 449, 455\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that judicial estoppel prevents \"a\n\nparty from taking a position inconsistent with one successfully and\n\nunequivocally asserted by that same party in a prior proceeding\").\n\nCourts normally refuse to apply judicial estoppel to one party\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fbased on the representations of an unrelated party.     See, e.g.,\n\nParker v. Wendy's Int'l, Inc., 365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.\n\n2004); Bethesda Lutheran Homes & Servs., Inc. v. Born, 238 F.3d\n\n853, 858 (7th Cir. 2001); Tenn. ex rel. Sizemore v. Surety Bank,\n\n200 F.3d 373, 381-82 (5th Cir. 2000); see also 18B Charles Alan\n\nWright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 4477, at 618-19 (2d ed. 2002).    Nevertheless, courts\n\nsometimes have allowed judicial estoppel when the estopped party\n\nwas responsible in fact for the earlier representation, see, e.g.,\n\nLadd v. ITT Corp., 148 F.3d 753, 756 (7th Cir. 1998), or when the\n\nestopped party was the assignee of a litigation claim or assumed\n\nthe original party's role, see 18B Wright et al., supra, § 4477, at\n\n618-19.\n\n          In the case at hand, the district court determined that\n\nthe appellants (Blum and the Yellins) should be judicially estopped\n\nfrom asserting that the amount due on the Notes was $7,494,435\n\nbecause a third party, Brown, had represented in his own bankruptcy\n\nproceeding that the unpaid balance was a mere $902,662, and had\n\nrepresented in CHI's bankruptcy that the total amount due on the\n\nNotes (including accrued interest) was $1,853,282.   Perry I, slip\n\nop. at 30.   The court bound the appellants to Brown's earlier\n\nrepresentations primarily on the theory that the appellants, as\n\npurchasers of the Notes, were subject to any defenses that Perry\n\nand CHI could have asserted against Brown himself.     Id. at 31 &\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fn.15.3      The court reasoned that because Brown would be judicially\n\nestopped from contradicting his prior representations anent the\n\namount      due    on   the   Notes,   his   assignees   should   be    similarly\n\nestopped.         Id. at 32-36.    The appellants say that Brown's\n\nrepresentations cannot be imputed to them and that, therefore,\n\njudicial estoppel was incorrectly invoked.\n\n              In examining these competing contentions, we take the\n\nunderlying substantive law — the law of negotiable instruments —\n\nfrom       Massachusetts.         Under      Massachusetts   law,      negotiable\n\ninstruments, such as the Notes, are governed by Article III of the\n\nUniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.).                See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,\n\n§ 3-102.      The U.C.C. states that a noteholder's right to enforce a\n\nnote is subject to certain defenses.                  Id. § 3-305(a).      These\n\ndefenses include those enumerated in section 3-305(a)(1) (often\n\ntermed \"real defenses\"), defenses specifically listed elsewhere in\n\nArticle III, and defenses \"that would be available if the person\n\nentitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to\n\n\n       3\n       The district court also mentioned approvingly the Fifth\nCircuit's decision in In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197 (5th\nCir.   1999),   for   the  proposition    that  a   third   party's\nmisrepresentation may be used to estop an unrelated party. Perry\nII, slip op. at 11.     Coastal Plains did not involve unrelated\nparties, see 179 F.3d at 203, 213, and in any event, its authority\non this specification is suspect. See, e.g., Biesek v. Soo Line\nR.R. Co., 440 F.3d 410, 412-13 (7th Cir. 2006) (declining to follow\nCoastal Plains); In re Riazuddin, 363 B.R. 177, 188 & n.53 (B.A.P.\n10th Cir. 2007) (same).     Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself has\ndistinguished Coastal Plains, based on its unique facts. See Kane\nv. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 535 F.3d 380, 387 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fpayment     under     a   simple   contract\"   (often   termed   \"personal\n\ndefenses\").     Id.       If a noteholder qualifies as a holder in due\n\ncourse, his right to enforce the note is subject only to real\n\ndefenses.    Id. § 3-305(b).\n\n            The appellants do not presume to be holders in due\n\ncourse.   See Perry II, slip op. at 12.        Thus, they are subject to\n\nthe axiom that the rights of a transferee who is not a holder in\n\ndue course rise no higher than the rights of the transferor.           See\n\n2 James J. White & Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 17-\n\n11, at 226 (5th ed. 2008).          It follows that the appellants, as\n\ntransferees, are subject to the trilogy of defenses described in\n\nsection 3-305(a) to the same extent that those defenses would have\n\nbeen available against the transferor (Brown).          See id.; see also\n\n25 Herbert Lemelman, Massachusetts Practice § 3:150, at 428 (3d ed.\n\n2002) (stating in essence that a holder who is not a holder in due\n\ncourse is treated under Massachusetts law as the assignee of a\n\ncontract).\n\n            This does not mean, however, that the transferor and the\n\ntransferee are to be treated as one and the same for all purposes.\n\nOf particular pertinence for present purposes, judicial estoppel\n\ndoes not fit comfortably within any of the trilogy of defenses\n\ndescribed in section 3-305(a).        Judicial estoppel is certainly not\n\na \"real defense\" within the provision of the statute, nor is it a\n\ndefense specifically listed anywhere in Article III of the U.C.C.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fThis leaves only the category of \"personal defenses.\"\n\n            Personal defenses typically are thought to be \"those\n\nbased on common law contract principles.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,\n\n§ 3-305(a) cmt. 2; see FDIC v. Wood, 758 F.2d 156, 160 (6th Cir.\n\n1985) (\"'Personal' defenses, such as failure of consideration and\n\nusury . . . are defenses or claims stemming from the underlying\n\ntransaction.\"). Judicial estoppel does not fit seamlessly into the\n\ntaxonomy of personal defenses, as it is not a defense aimed\n\ndirectly    at   either   the   validity   or    the   enforceability   of   a\n\ncontract.    Rather, it is a judge-made doctrine designed to protect\n\nthe integrity of the judicial system.           See New Hampshire, 532 U.S.\n\nat 749. This seeming incongruence gives us some pause about trying\n\nto ram the square peg of judicial estoppel into the round hole of\n\npersonal defenses.\n\n            Still, we recognize that the boundaries of judicial\n\nestoppel are hazy.    It is conceivable that cases may arise in which\n\nthe doctrine can be considered a personal defense, used to prevent\n\na noteholder from playing fast and loose with the courts through,\n\nsay, engaging a straw to assert a payoff amount contradictory to\n\none earlier put forth by the noteholder himself. See G-I Holdings,\n\nInc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 586 F.3d 247, 262 (3d Cir. 2009) (\"We\n\nwill apply [judicial estoppel] to neutralize threats to judicial\n\nintegrity however they may arise.\"); cf. FDIC v. Gulf Life Ins.\n\nCo., 737 F.2d 1513, 1518 (11th Cir. 1984) (suggesting that, for\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnegotiable instruments, general estoppel may constitute a personal\n\ndefense, \"to which a holder in due course would be impregnable\").\n\nThe combinations of possible circumstances are infinitely varied,\n\nand a flat holding that judicial estoppel can be circumvented\n\nsimply by transferring property to a third party would be folly.\n\nSee generally Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87-88 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (emphasizing utility of judicial estoppel as a means of\n\npreventing a party from obtaining an unfair advantage).\n\n           Here, however, we need not grapple with the admittedly\n\ndifficult question of whether judicial estoppel may ever qualify as\n\na personal defense.       In our view, the district court's application\n\nof judicial estoppel suffers from a different infirmity: Perry has\n\nfailed to satisfy the second requirement for judicial estoppel. He\n\nhas not shown that the bankruptcy court actually accepted Brown's\n\nrepresentation of the value of the Notes.\n\n           The party proposing an application of judicial estoppel\n\nmust show that the relevant court actually accepted the other\n\nparty's earlier representation.              See Gens v. Resolution Trust\n\nCorp., 112 F.3d 569, 572 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Judicial estoppel is not\n\nimplicated unless the first forum accepted the legal or factual\n\nassertion alleged to be at odds with the position advanced in the\n\ncurrent forum . . . .\" (emphasis in original)).              \"Acceptance\" in\n\nthis   context   is   a   term   of   art.     In   order   to   satisfy   this\n\nprerequisite, a party need not show that the earlier representation\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fled to a favorable ruling on the merits of the proceeding in which\n\nit was made, but must show that the court adopted and relied on the\n\nrepresented position either in a preliminary matter or as part of\n\na final disposition. See, e.g., Pennycuff v. Fentress Cnty. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 404 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir. 2005); Karaha Bodas Co. v.\n\nPerusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 364 F.3d 274,\n\n294 (5th Cir. 2004); see also Global NAPs, 603 F.3d at 90 (finding\n\nthat court accepted party's first representation by relying on it\n\nin granting temporary restraining order); Alt. Sys. Concepts, 374\n\nF.3d at 34 (explaining that because court relied on party's initial\n\nposition in denying motion to dismiss, party \"derived a direct (if\n\ntemporary) benefit from its original position\").\n\n          The showing of judicial acceptance must be a strong one.\n\nSee SBT Holdings, LLC v. Town of Westminster, 547 F.3d 28, 37 & n.8\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (rejecting judicial estoppel argument because\n\nrecord was unclear as to whether court accepted plaintiff's prior\n\nposition); cf. United States v. Pakala, 568 F.3d 47, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (upholding judicial estoppel when it was \"clearly obvious\"\n\nthat the original trial court, in granting a motion, \"necessarily\n\nadopted\" the position that the movant later sought to contradict);\n\nUnited Nat'l Ins.

The need for a strong showing\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fderives from the maxim that \"[j]udicial estoppel is applied with\n\ncaution to avoid impinging on the truth-seeking function of the\n\ncourt because the doctrine precludes a contradictory position\n\nwithout examining the truth of either statement.\" Teledyne Indus.,\n\nInc. v.

See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Ret.\n\nIncome Plan for Hourly-Rated Emps. of ASARCO, Inc., 512 F.3d 555,\n\n563-64   (9th   Cir.    2008)      (finding    that   failure      to   demonstrate\n\njudicial acceptance precludes application of estoppel where \"the\n\ndistrict court never held\" the notion urged by the party) (emphasis\n\nin original); United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 794 (1st\n\nCir. 1988) (rejecting \"illogical surmise\" about what prior court\n\nmight have accepted as a basis for judicial estoppel).                    Perry has\n\nnot made the requisite showing here.\n\n             There    are   only    two   possible     actions      taken    by   the\n\nbankruptcy court that Brown's representation might have affected.\n\nFirst, in Brown's bankruptcy proceeding, the court allowed him to\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fretain the Notes after he stated the amount due and represented\n\nthat the Notes were uncollectible.          Second, in the CHI bankruptcy\n\n(in which Brown intervened), the court lifted the automatic stay,\n\nallowing Brown to foreclose on the Fenmore.            There is no evidence\n\nthat either action was premised on Brown's statements about the\n\namount owed on the Notes, and it is implausible to infer any such\n\nnexus.\n\n            We examine these two actions in reverse order. It defies\n\nlogic to deduce that the bankruptcy court granted Brown relief from\n\nthe automatic stay on the basis of the amount owed on the Notes.\n\nA larger figure would not have supported keeping the stay in place\n\n—   if   anything,   a   greater   amount   owed    would    have   created    an\n\nadditional incentive for the court to allow the foreclosure to\n\nproceed post-haste.\n\n            Similarly, it is utterly speculative to suggest that the\n\nbankruptcy    court,     in   approving   Brown's   global    settlement      and\n\nallowing him to retain the Notes, accepted each and every one of\n\nhis figures.    Generally speaking, settlement \"neither requires nor\n\nimplies any judicial endorsement of either party's claims or\n\ntheories.\"    In re Bankvest Capital Corp., 375 F.3d 51, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Bates v. Long Island R.R. Co., 997 F.2d 1028, 1038\n\n(2d Cir. 1993)).         So viewed, an unexplained settlement does not\n\nprovide the prior success necessary for judicial estoppel.                    See\n\nC & M Props., LLC v. Burbidge, 377 B.R. 677, 685 (D. Utah 2007)\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f(noting that \"[t]he the fact that [debtor] obtained confirmation of\n\nits [plan] does not demonstrate that the bankruptcy court was\n\nmisled\" and thus finding that second element of judicial estoppel\n\nwas not satisfied), vacated on other grounds by In re C & M Props.,\n\nL.L.C., 563 F.3d 1156, 1168 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n          Perry surmises, but offers no semblance of proof, that a\n\nbankruptcy     court      would      treat   uncollectible    notes      worth   over\n\n$7,000,000     differently        than    uncollectible     notes   worth    roughly\n\n$1,000,000.      It       is,   of    course,    possible   that,   in   particular\n\ncircumstances,        a    bankruptcy        court   might    indulge       in   such\n\ndifferential treatment.              Here, however, the surmised inference is\n\nsimply not plausible.           By definition, an uncollectible note is an\n\nuncollectible note (and, thus, worthless). In any event, either of\n\nthese figures pales in comparison to $134,105,736 — the sum of the\n\nclaims of Brown's creditors at the time of the settlement.                   In this\n\ncase, then, the variation in amount is a distinction that makes no\n\ndifference.4\n\n\n     4\n       We note that one court has treated settlements in ordinary\nlitigation and those arising in the context of bankruptcy\nproceedings differently. Reynolds v. Comm'r, 861 F.2d 469, 473\n(6th Cir. 1988) (explaining that bankruptcy may give rise to\ngreater judicial acceptance of the parties' positions because the\ncourt there \"is charged with an affirmative obligation to apprise\nitself of the underlying facts and to make an independent judgment\nas to whether the compromise is fair and equitable\"). We need not\ncomment upon the correctness of this approach as Perry has offered\nnothing more than speculation to suggest that the bankruptcy court\nwas motivated by the amount due on the Notes, rather than their\nuncollectible status. Cf. id. at 473-74 (noting that the accepted\nrepresentation \"was essential to the bankruptcy judge's approval of\n\n                                          -20-\n\f            For   what    it   may    be    worth,      Brown    himself   neither\n\nexplicitly nor implicitly contradicted his original representation\n\nas to the amount due on the Notes.                He placed that figure at\n\n$902,662 and later sold the Notes for a figure in the same ballpark\n\n— $950,000.    These events do not support a suggestion that he was\n\nattempting to defraud or mislead the bankruptcy court.                     This is\n\npotentially important because judicial estoppel is not meant to be\n\na trap for the unwary and should be employed sparingly when \"there\n\nis no evidence of intent to manipulate or mislead the courts.\"\n\nRyan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co., 81 F.3d 355,\n\n365 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n            To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.\n\nConjecture,   without     more,      cannot   support      the    application    of\n\njudicial estoppel.       See SBT Holdings, 547 F.3d at 37 & n.8.                Put\n\nanother way, remote possibilities are not enough. Consequently, we\n\nhold that the district court committed legal error (and, thus,\n\nabused its discretion) in judicially estopping the appellants,\n\nbased on a third party's earlier representation, from attempting to\n\nprove that the amount due on the Notes was more than $1,853,282.\n\n            In an effort to repair this hole in the fabric of their\n\nargument,   Perry   and    CHI    urge     that   the    appellants    should    be\n\njudicially estopped based on Yellin's prior representation.                     The\n\n\n\n\nthe parties' compromise\") (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                      -21-\n\fdistrict court rejected this alternative theory, Perry II, slip op.\n\nat 10, and so do we.\n\n              The salient facts are as follows.           In 1997, Perry, on\n\nbehalf of CHI, sued the appellants in a Massachusetts state court.\n\nHe moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the\n\nFenmore.      As part of his opposition, Yellin filed an affidavit\n\nindicating, in its background recitals, that the amount due on the\n\nNotes was $1,900,000.          The state court denied Perry's motion.\n\nPerry   did    not   appeal   the   denial,   and   the   court    subsequently\n\ndismissed the case for want of prosecution.\n\n              In the court below, Perry and CHI advanced an alternative\n\nclaim of judicial estoppel premised on Yellin's affidavit.                  The\n\ndistrict court did not bite, reasoning that the state court \"took\n\nno action in reliance on [the $1.9 million] figure\" and \"ultimately\n\ndismissed the case for lack of prosecution.\"              Id.     Perry and CHI\n\nchallenge this holding.        Noting that the state court accepted the\n\nfiling of Yellin's affidavit and denied the preliminary injunction,\n\nthey say that no more was exigible to ground a subsequent claim of\n\njudicial estoppel.      We do not agree.\n\n              Based on the facts recounted above, the first element\n\nneeded for judicial estoppel is satisfied.                The representation\n\nabout the Notes' value, as expressed by the appellants in the\n\ndistrict court, is inconsistent with the earlier representation\n\nthat Yellin made in the state court.\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\f               Once   again,    however,   the    second    element   is    more\n\nproblematic.       There is absolutely no basis for believing that the\n\nstate court adopted or relied on the $1,900,000 figure contained in\n\nYellin's affidavit.        The absence of any evidence to that effect is\n\nfatal.    See SBT Holdings, 547 F.3d at 37 & n.8; Levasseur, 846 F.2d\n\nat 794.\n\n               Perry and CHI suggest that the state court may have\n\nrelied    on    Yellin's    representation   in    denying   the   motion   for\n\npreliminary injunction.         But this suggestion is woven entirely out\n\nof gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.              In addition, the\n\nsuggestion       is   counterintuitive.      Perry    and    CHI   sought   the\n\npreliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the Fenmore, and\n\nthe amount of the indebtedness had virtually nothing to do with the\n\nquestion raised in that motion.              In other words, whether the\n\nbalance owed was $1,900,000 or $7,000,000 or some figure in between\n\nhad no apparent bearing on whether the foreclosure should (or\n\nshould not) be enjoined.           Cf. Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v.\n\nBaccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (listing factors\n\nrelevant to preliminary injunction inquiry).               There is simply no\n\nplausible basis for supposing that Yellin's representation about\n\nthe amount due factored into the state court's decisional calculus.\n\n                           B.   Equity of Redemption.\n\n               Given our previous conclusion, see supra Part II(A), the\n\ndistrict court's accounting will have to be reworked.                 Once the\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\famount due on the Notes is established and subtracted — after all,\n\nthe Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the Fenmore\n\nand, thus, give rise to a high-priority equitable lien on the\n\nforeclosure proceeds — the question becomes how the court should\n\ntreat the $5,000,000 paid to settle the FDIC's claims against the\n\nYellin     Parties.      The    appellants     argue     that    this    payment\n\nextinguished the third and fourth mortgages and, thus, should be\n\noffset before calculating the equity of redemption.               The district\n\ncourt made no such offset.         The appellants assign error to this\n\nstep in the progression.\n\n            The calculation of an equitable accounting is, within\n\nbroad limits, committed to the district court's discretion.                 Tamko\n\nRoofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., 282 F.3d 23, 39 (1st\n\nCir. 2002). Accordingly, \"we will not disturb [such a calculation]\n\nunless it rests on clearly erroneous findings of fact, incorrect\n\nlegal standards, or a meaningful error in judgment.\"               Id.; see In\n\nre Blinds to Go Share Purchase Litig., 443 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (\"Because the district court 'is in a considerably better\n\nposition    to   bring   the   scales   into   balance    than   an     appellate\n\ntribunal,' we will not normally find an abuse of discretion unless,\n\nupon whole-record review, we are convinced that the district court\n\ncommitted a significant error in judgment.\" (quoting Rosario-Torres\n\nv. Hernández-Colón, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc))).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f              As co-owners of the foreclosed Fenmore, Perry and Yellin\n\nare jointly entitled to the equity of redemption.                     Stripped of\n\nrhetorical      flourishes,     the    appellants'        contention    is    that\n\ncalculating this figure is a purely mechanical exercise, which\n\nrequires that payments made to extinguish liens on the property be\n\nsubtracted      before    the   co-owners     can     divide    the     remaining\n\nforeclosure surplus.       Building on this foundation, the appellants\n\nposit that the district court erred in refusing to offset the\n\n$5,000,000 payment that they made to the FDIC because that payment\n\nextinguished the third and fourth mortgages on the Fenmore.\n\n              This argument has a patina of plausibility.             Under basic\n\nprinciples of property law, the holder of the equity of redemption\n\ndoes not have a property interest in foreclosure proceeds unless\n\nand   until    all    outstanding     liens   on    the   property     have   been\n\nextinguished.        See First Colonial Bank for Sav. v. Bergeron, 646\n\nN.E.2d 758, 759 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995); see also Restatement (Third)\n\nof Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4 (1997) (\"When the foreclosure sale price\n\nexceeds the amount of the mortgage obligation, the surplus is\n\napplied to liens and other interests terminated by the foreclosure\n\nin order of their priority and the remaining balance, if any, is\n\ndistributed to the holder of the equity of redemption.\"). A junior\n\nlienholder has an equitable lien, transferred from the foreclosed\n\npremises, that attaches to the foreclosure surplus.              See New Haven\n\nSav. Bank v. Follins, 431 F. Supp. 2d 183, 196 (D. Mass. 2006); see\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\falso Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4, cmt. a (1997)\n\n(explaining that the \"surplus stands in the place of the foreclosed\n\nreal estate, and the liens and interests that previously attached\n\nto the real estate now attach to the surplus\").\n\n          The   appellants   take   these   abecedarian   property   law\n\nprinciples to mean that because they settled with the FDIC and\n\nthereby extinguished the FDIC's equitable lien on the foreclosure\n\nproceeds, the $5,000,000 settlement amount must come off the top\n\nbefore the equity of redemption is calculated.     The district court\n\ninstead treated the $5,000,000 as a part of the distribution of the\n\nappellants' share of the equity of redemption.      See Appendix.\n\n          The appellants' construct reflects a kind of tunnel\n\nvision.   It fails to take into consideration that the challenged\n\ncalculations are not entries on a closing sheet at a foreclosure\n\nbut, rather, are calculations made in the context of a judicial\n\naccounting.     This matters because an accounting is not a rote\n\nexercise in arithmetic.      To the contrary, it is an equitable\n\nremedy, see Braunstein v. McCabe, 571 F.3d 108, 122 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(citing Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 49 n.7\n\n(1989)), and equitable remedies \"are flexible tools to be applied\n\nwith the focus on fairness and justice.\" Demoulas v. Demoulas, 703\n\nN.E.2d 1149, 1169 (Mass. 1998) (citing 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of\n\nRemedies § 2.1(3), at 63 (2d ed. 1993)).\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\f            The district court understood this distinction.                    It\n\nrefused to offset the $5,000,000 settlement before calculating the\n\nequity of redemption.          The court based this determination on a\n\nfinding that the primary purpose of the settlement was not to\n\nextinguish    the   FDIC's     lien,   but    to    release   the   Yellins   from\n\npersonal liability on a wide range of loans (many of which were\n\ncompletely unrelated to the Fenmore).               See Perry III, slip op. at\n\n1.    In effect, Yellin used money that otherwise would have had to\n\nbe shared with Perry to defray his personal obligations, leaving\n\nPerry to settle separately with the FDIC using his own resources.\n\nSee supra note 1.          In the district court's words, Yellin \"ha[d]\n\nBlum conduct the Fenmore foreclosure sale and hand over the first\n\n$5 million in proceeds to the FDIC\" to satisfy Yellin's personal\n\nobligations.    See Perry III, slip op. at 1.            The court found that\n\narrangement    to     be    \"the   product     of    precisely      the   improper\n\nrelationship    and    underhanded     dealings\"      that    characterized   the\n\nappellants' course of conduct.          Id.; see also Perry I, slip op. at\n\n13.\n\n            This finding is eminently supportable.               The only reason\n\nwhy Yellin was able to use foreclosure proceeds to fund his\n\npersonal settlement was because of his relationship with Blum, who,\n\nas a straw for Yellin, held the senior mortgages on the Fenmore.\n\n            In performing an equitable accounting, the district court\n\nis not a mere scrivener, charged with carrying out a ministerial\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\ftask. Instead, the court is charged with tempering arithmetic with\n\nequity, or, as we phrased it in Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 323,\n\n\"bring[ing] the scales into balance.\"           In this context, we think\n\nthat the district court acted within the sphere of its discretion\n\nin preventing Yellin from unjustly enriching himself, to the\n\ndetriment of his quondam partner, by what the district court\n\nwarrantably found were underhanded dealings.            See 1 Dobbs, supra,\n\n§   4.3(5),    at   610   (explaining   that   an   accounting   \"forces   the\n\nfiduciary defendant to disgorge gains received from improper use of\n\nthe plaintiff's property or entitlements\").            Accordingly, we hold\n\nthat the district court neither erred nor abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to subtract the $5,000,000 payment before calculating the\n\nequity of redemption.\n\n                                C.   Joinder.\n\n              The Yellins claim that the district court violated the\n\nDue Process Clause by joining them as reach-and-apply defendants\n\nafter the trial had ended.        A few additional facts are needed to\n\nbring the claim into perspective.\n\n              When the FDIC originally filed a claim in the underlying\n\nlitigation, it named the Yellins, among others, as defendants. But\n\nfollowing the settlement of the FDIC's claims against them, the\n\nYellins were dropped from the suit on June 10, 2002.                Two days\n\nlater, Perry brought Blum, as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust,\n\nback into the case by filing a cross-claim against him.           The cross-\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fclaim did not specifically name the Yellins, but it did name \"John\n\nDoe\" as a reach-and-apply defendant.            \"John Doe\" was described as\n\n\"a person or persons, or an entity or entities, to whom funds\n\ngenerated    by   the   foreclosure    sale     of   the   Fenmore    have   been\n\ntransferred by Blum, for less than full consideration.\"\n\n             Almost two years later, Perry sought to amend his cross-\n\nclaim to add the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants.                       The\n\ndistrict court referred this motion to a magistrate judge.                   See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).      On November 29, 2004, the magistrate judge\n\ndenied it.    Perry moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration but did\n\nnot appeal that denial to the district judge.\n\n             The cross-claim was tried to the court in early 2005.\n\nDuring trial, Perry again moved to join the Yellins as reach-and-\n\napply defendants.       The district court suggested that Perry file a\n\nwritten motion to conform the pleadings to the proof.                See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 15(b).      Perry filed such a motion on June 24, 2005.              The\n\ndistrict court took the entire case (including the motion) under\n\nadvisement for over three years.\n\n             On   October   31,   2008,   the   court      issued   its   written\n\ndecision.     In that rescript, the court granted the motion to join\n\nthe Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants.              Perry I, slip op. at\n\n36.   The Yellins sought reconsideration, to no avail.                Perry II,\n\nslip op. at 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\f          The district court premised its order on Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 21.5    We review an order joining a party under Rule\n\n21 for abuse of discretion.    See Cornelius v. Hogan, 663 F.2d 330,\n\n335 (1st Cir. 1981).    Within that rubric, embedded legal questions\n\nare reviewed de novo.    See United States v. Platte, 577 F.3d 387,\n\n391 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          Rule 21 stated that \"[p]arties may be dropped or added by\n\norder of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative\n\nat any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\"\n\nAlthough the rule permits joinder at any stage of the proceedings,\n\njoinder in a particular case must comport with the strictures of\n\ndue process.     Moore v. Knowles, 482 F.2d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.\n\n1973).   These strictures include notice and an opportunity to be\n\nheard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.     Eakins v.\n\nReed, 710 F.2d 184, 186-87 (4th Cir. 1983).\n\n          For obvious reasons, joinder of a defendant after trial\n\nis disfavored.   See, e.g., Cabrera v. Mun'y of Bayamon, 622 F.2d 4,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1980).     In such a situation, concerns about possible\n\nprejudice to the late-joined party loom large.        7 Charles Alan\n\nWright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 1688.1, at 510 (3d ed. 2001).\n\n\n\n     5\n       Rule 21 was amended in 2007, but the changes were merely\nstylistic.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 21 advisory committee's note.\nConsequently, we refer here to the rule as it stood at the time of\nthe trial.\n\n                                 -30-\n\f          The    case   at   bar,   however,   is   highly    idiosyncratic.\n\nFirst, the Yellins originally were parties to the action.            Second,\n\nthey were on notice of Perry's desire to add them as defendants by\n\nreason of both his pretrial motion to do so and his mid-trial\n\nmotion to that effect.       Third, in his original cross-claim, Perry\n\nnamed a \"John Doe\" reach-and-apply defendant, describing \"John Doe\"\n\nin terms that fit the Yellins to a \"T.\"         These circumstances gave\n\nthe district court an adequate basis for finding that the Yellins\n\nhad notice sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.\n\nSee Insituform Techs., Inc. v. CAT Contracting, Inc., 385 F.3d\n\n1360, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (rejecting defendant's due process\n\nargument against post-trial joinder because plaintiffs had made\n\npretrial attempts to join him).\n\n          Similarly, the record permits a conclusion that the\n\nYellins had a meaningful opportunity to be heard.            Blum was a party\n\nall along, and the district court supportably found that he was a\n\nstand-in for the Yellins.       Perry I, slip op. at 11-12.         As such,\n\nBlum had substantially the same interests as the Yellins. Blum was\n\ntheir proxy and, as befits a proxy, he and the Yellins shared the\n\nsame counsel.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       This is not a situation in which, as in Eakins, 710 F.2d at\n187, a late-joined party and a timely-joined party shared the same\ncounsel but had interests that were not \"sufficiently identical.\"\nIn this instance, the identity of interests is palpable.\n\n                                    -31-\n\f               To add to the picture, the Yellins testified extensively\n\nat the trial.           Consequently, their narrative accounts of the\n\ncentral issues in the case were before the court.            That is an\n\nimportant consideration in the due process equation.        See Fromson\n\nv. Citiplate, Inc., 886 F.2d 1300, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (upholding\n\npost-judgment joinder where interests of late-joined defendant and\n\ntimely-joined defendants were \"virtually complete\").\n\n               To cinch matters, a party who claims to be aggrieved by\n\na violation of procedural due process must show prejudice.          See\n\nAmouri v. Holder, 572 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v.\n\nSaccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 770-71 (1st Cir. 1995).       The Yellins have\n\nnot identified any evidence which, had they been joined earlier,\n\nthey could have introduced; nor have they made any other showing of\n\nactual prejudice.7\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               This is a complicated, hard-fought case.   Both sides are\n\nrepresented by highly proficient counsel, but objective appraisals\n\nof the facts are to some extent held hostage to the parties'\n\nrancor.      The district judge has demonstrated patience and skill in\n\nsorting out what really happened and navigating through a legal\n\n\n\n       7\n       In all events, any possible prejudice can be avoided here.\nIf the Yellins have any evidence that bears on the accounting, the\npresent posture of this case affords the district court the\nflexibility, when the case is returned to it, to reopen the case\nand provide the Yellins with an opportunity to supplement the\nrecord.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fminefield.    We are reluctant to prolong a case that already has\n\nlingered for a decade, but there is no other principled course\n\navailable to us.   Perhaps, given the passage of time and the large\n\nsums already spent on litigation, the parties have reached a point\n\nat which a negotiated resolution of their remaining differences is\n\npossible.    One can only hope.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in\n\ninvoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel to limit the appellants'\n\nproof as to the amount owed on the Notes.      Thus, we reverse that\n\nruling.   In turn, this holding requires vacation of the judgment.\n\nThe district court will have to determine the actual amount due on\n\nthe Notes at the relevant time and rework the accounting.    We take\n\nno view as to the amount due on the Notes; although the appellants\n\nassert that the amount due is $7,494,435, Perry and CHI fiercely\n\ndispute the basis for that figure.\n\n            The other rulings appealed from are affirmed, and further\n\nproceedings in the district court shall be conducted consistent\n\nwith this opinion.     On remand, the district court may take such\n\nfurther evidence as it deems appropriate.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated, and remanded.       All\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\f                            Appendix\n\n         The district court entered a judgment in favor of Perry\nin the amount of $4,347,126.     This amount was calculated as\nfollows:\n\nCombined Proceeds from the Fenmore:\nProceeds from foreclosure sale              $9,450,000\nNet rents collected on the Fenmore          $1,660,797\nNet combined proceeds                      $11,110,797\n\nCredits, Adjustments, and Amount Due on Notes:\nCosts of foreclosure                           $154,440\nAmount due on Notes as of foreclosure date $2,262,105\nTotal credits and adjustments               $2,416,545\n\nEquity of Redemption:\nNet combined proceeds                      $11,110,797\nLess credits and adjustments               -$2,416,545\nFenmore's equity of redemption              $8,694,252\nPerry's 50% share                           $4,347,126\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f",

To solve this conundrum, we must answer three loosely related questions. The first concerns the applicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the second concerns the way in which the methodology for calculating the equity of redemption fits within the framework of a judicial accounting, and the third concerns the propriety of a post-trial joinder of additional defendants. After careful consideration of these questions, we reject the district court's proposed application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel but uphold its treatment of the equity of redemption and its joinder order. When all is said and done, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Although there is a long, convoluted, and sometimes Machiavellian history involving the protagonists, we relate here only those facts relevant to the issues presented on appeal. We supplement this account in connection with our discussion of particular issues. Throughout, we accept the district court's factual findings to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous. <i>Limone v. United States,</i> 579 F.3d 79, 94 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,</i> 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p>Michael Perry and Stephen Yellin each hold a fifty percent interest in Condominium Housing, Incorporated (CHI), which owned a large apartment complex in Boston, Massachusetts, known as \"the Fenmore.\" CHI purchased the Fenmore from Harold Brown in 1985. The purchase price included two promissory notes, with an aggregate face value of approximately $11,000,000 (the Notes), executed by Perry and Yellin as co-makers. The Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the property.</p>\n<p>Over time, Perry and Yellin made payments on the Notes. But when the Boston real estate market cratered in the late 1980s, they defaulted on several obligations, including not only the Notes but also an array of loans from their primary lender, Capitol Bank (which, among other things, held a third mortgage on the Fenmore). By 1990, Perry and Yellin owed Capitol Bank more than $7,000,000. They negotiated a settlement with the bank in July of that year, but the settlement proved to be illusory. The bank subsequently repudiated it, and Perry and Yellin were forced to sue for specific performance in a Massachusetts state court.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> During the currency of that suit, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Capitol Bank as its receiver and liquidating agent. The FDIC sought to collect Perry's and Yellin's indebtedness to the bank, claiming that they owed roughly $19,000,000 in principal and accrued interest on various loans. As part of its collection effort, the FDIC disavowed the earlier settlement and, in January of 1999, filed an amended counterclaim in the state court suit.</p>\n<p>The amended counterclaim named as defendants Perry, Yellin, and a number of their relatives. These additional defendants (whom we shall call the \"Perry Parties\" and the \"Yellin Parties\") were allegedly involved in Perry's and Yellin's real estate enterprises as \"straws.\" In due season, the FDIC removed the state court action to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>Brown's fortunes also had been adversely affected by the slumping real estate market. In 1991, he filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy proceedings dragged on and, in August of 1996, he submitted an affidavit to the bankruptcy court in which he represented that the Notes had an unpaid balance of $902,662 and were uncollectible. The bankruptcy court granted Brown a discharge from bankruptcy in September of 1996 and permitted him to retain ownership of the Notes.</p>\n<p>CHI went into bankruptcy in April of 1996. After Brown emerged from his own bankruptcy, he intervened in CHI's bankruptcy and requested relief from the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362, so that he could foreclose on the Fenmore. Brown represented that the Notes had a principal balance of $902,662 and past-due interest of $950,620. The bankruptcy court granted Brown's motion to lift the stay in December of 1996. Instead of foreclosing, however, Brown agreed to sell the Notes to Yellin for $950,000. Yellin effectuated this purchase behind Perry's back and through a straw: Steven Blum, in his capacity as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust. The sole beneficiary of the trust was North Shore Renewal, Inc., a shell corporation wholly owned by Yellin's wife, Elaine. Yellin, acting through Blum, then took control of the Fenmore as a mortgagee-in-possession and began collecting rents.</p>\n<p>In June of 1997, Perry, on behalf of CHI, sued the Yellins and Blum, individually and as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust, in a Massachusetts state court. The suit alleged an alphabet of wrongdoing, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and conversion, stemming from the purchase of the Notes. In October of 1998, after Perry failed to attend a pretrial conference, the state court dismissed the suit for want of prosecution. <i>CHI v. Blum,</i> No. 97-3007 (Mass.Dist.Ct. Oct. 7, 1998) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>In late 1997, Yellin, acting through Blum, commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the Fenmore. The FDIC, which held junior mortgages on the property as the receiver for Capitol Bank, responded by bringing an action in the federal district court. In the action, the FDIC sought to enjoin any foreclosure sale. The district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the foreclosure sale. Later, it consolidated the action in which it had granted the injunction with the action that the FDIC had removed from the state court.</p>\n<p>In 2002, Yellin and the Yellin Parties settled with the FDIC for $5,000,000. Under the terms of the settlement, the FDIC permitted Yellin, acting through Blum, to foreclose on the Fenmore and use the first $5,000,000 of the foreclosure proceeds to fund the settlement. The district court thereafter dissolved the existing injunction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> and Blum foreclosed on the Fenmore. The apartment complex was sold at auction for $9,450,000 (ironically, to Brown). The FDIC and the Yellin Parties then jointly moved to dismiss all claims inter sese. The district court granted that motion on June 10, 2002.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Following the foreclosure sale, Perry, on behalf of himself and CHI, cross-claimed against Blum for an accounting of both the foreclosure proceeds and all rents collected between 1996 and 2002. Perry alleged that, as an equal partner in CHI, he was entitled to one-half of the Fenmore's equity of redemption.</p>\n<p>In February and March of 2005, the district court held a bench trial on the cross-claim. The Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the Fenmore, so Blum, as the noteholder and as a straw for Yellin, had a priority claim to the foreclosure proceeds. Not surprisingly, then, one of the main issues at trial concerned the amount due on the Notes. Blum contended that $7,494,435 was due. Perry contended that the amount due was much less. The district court determined that Blum was estopped from asserting that the amount due was anything other than what Brown, Blum's predecessor-in-interest, had represented in the bankruptcy court, namely, $1,853,282. <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry I</i>), No. 99-12194, slip op. at 30 (D.Mass. Oct. 31, 2008).<sup>[2]</sup> Even though the trial had ended years earlier, the court granted Perry's motion to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 36.</p>\n<p>Before the court actually made a final accounting, Blum and the Yellins moved for reconsideration of <i>Perry I,</i> arguing that the court had erred in applying judicial estoppel and in joining the Yellins after trial. The court denied the motion, <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry II</i>), No. 99-12194, slip op. at 2 (D. Mass. June 2, 2009). The court then prepared the accounting and entered judgment for Perry against Blum and the Yellins in the sum of $4,347,126, plus pre-judgment interest. The appendix to this opinion delineates the manner in which the court calculated this amount.</p>\n<p>Blum and the Yellins moved to alter or amend the judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), protesting that the court had erred in excluding from its calculation of the equity of redemption an offset for the $5,000,000 payment that the Yellins had made to the FDIC  an offset that would have had the effect of reducing Perry's award by $2,500,000. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that it would be inequitable to allow Yellin to settle his personal debts by using foreclosure proceeds that otherwise would have to be split with Perry. <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry III</i>), No. 99-12194 (D. Mass. June 18, 2009) (unpublished order). Blum and the Yellins filed a timely motion of appeal from both the final judgment and the denial of their Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Like a milking stool, this appeal rests on three legs. The appellants (Blum and the Yellins) insist that the district court erred in (i) invoking judicial estoppel, (ii) miscalculating the equity of redemption, and (iii) adding the Yellins as defendants after the trial had ended. We discuss each of these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> arguments separately. Before doing so, however, we pause to make a point about choice of law.</p>\n<p>Due to the FDIC's involvement, this case had its roots in federal question jurisdiction. 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(A); 28 U.S.C. § 1331. But the FDIC has departed from the scene, and the remaining claims are cognizable only under supplemental jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Where, as here, a federal court proceeds under supplemental jurisdiction, it is obliged to apply federal procedural law and state substantive law. <i>Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007). To the extent that procedural issues loom, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide the beacon by which we must steer.</p>\n<p>Most of the components of the appellants' asseverational array raise substantive questions and, thus, require us to apply Massachusetts law. Withal, one of the issues presents a thorny problem of classification, which this court has not resolved: Is judicial estoppel procedural (and, thus, governed by federal law) or substantive (and, thus, governed by state law)?</p>\n<p>This is an interesting Rubik's cube, but we need not provide a definitive answer here. The parties and the district court all assumed that federal standards of judicial estoppel governed, and the case has been briefed and argued on the same assumption. In such circumstances, we may hold the parties to their plausible choice of law, whether or not that choice is correct. <i>See </i><i>Thore v. Howe,</i> 466 F.3d 173, 181 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir.2004). We follow that prudential course and apply federal law in discussing this issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Judicial Estoppel.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants insist that the district court erred in invoking judicial estoppel to preclude them from showing that the amount due on the Notes was anything other than what Brown had represented in a prior bankruptcy proceeding. We review for abuse of discretion a district court's application of judicial estoppel. <i>Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Engl. Inc.,</i> 603 F.3d 71, 91 (1st Cir.2010). Within that rubric, we accept the trial court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, <i>see </i><i>Limone,</i> 579 F.3d at 94; <i>Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152, and evaluate its answers to abstract questions of law de novo, <i>see </i><i>San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 612 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2010). We treat a material mistake of law as a per se abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The doctrine of judicial estoppel is equitable in nature. It operates to prevent a litigant from taking a litigation position that is inconsistent with a litigation position successfully asserted by him in an earlier phase of the same case or in an earlier court proceeding. <i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir.2003). The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process. It is typically invoked when a litigant tries to play fast and loose with the courts. <i>New Hampshire v. Maine,</i> 532 U.S. 742, 749-50, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001); <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 33; <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinemas Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>The contours of judicial estoppel are hazy. But even though its elements cannot be reduced to a scientifically precise formula, <i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, courts generally require the presence of three things before introducing the doctrine into a particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> case. First, a party's earlier and later positions must be clearly inconsistent. <i>Id.</i>; <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 33. Second, the party must have succeeded in persuading a court to accept the earlier position. <i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808; <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 33. Third, the party seeking to assert the inconsistent position must stand to derive an unfair advantage if the new position is accepted by the court. <i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808; <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, the party against whom judicial estoppel is invoked must be the same party who made the prior (inconsistent) representation. <i>See </i><i>InterGen,</i> 344 F.3d at 144 (explaining that judicial estoppel \"prevents a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant\" in the same or an earlier proceeding); <i>Brewer v. Madigan,</i> 945 F.2d 449, 455 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that judicial estoppel prevents \"a party from taking a position inconsistent with one successfully and unequivocally asserted by that same party in a prior proceeding\"). Courts normally refuse to apply judicial estoppel to one party based on the representations of an unrelated party. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Parker v. Wendy's Int'l, Inc.,</i> 365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Bethesda Lutheran Homes &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Born,</i> 238 F.3d 853, 858 (7th Cir.2001); <i>Tenn. ex rel. Sizemore v. Surety Bank,</i> 200 F.3d 373, 381-82 (5th Cir.2000); <i>see also</i> 18B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4477, at 618-19 (2d ed. 2002). Nevertheless, courts sometimes have allowed judicial estoppel when the estopped party was responsible in fact for the earlier representation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ladd v. ITT Corp.,</i> 148 F.3d 753, 756 (7th Cir.1998), or when the estopped party was the assignee of a litigation claim or assumed the original party's role, <i>see</i> 18B Wright et al., <i>supra,</i> § 4477, at 618-19.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court determined that the appellants (Blum and the Yellins) should be judicially estopped from asserting that the amount due on the Notes was $7,494,435 because a third party, Brown, had represented in his own bankruptcy proceeding that the unpaid balance was a mere $902,662, and had represented in CHI's bankruptcy that the total amount due on the Notes (including accrued interest) was $1,853,282. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 30. The court bound the appellants to Brown's earlier representations primarily on the theory that the appellants, as purchasers of the Notes, were subject to any defenses that Perry and CHI could have asserted against Brown himself. <i>Id.</i> at 31 &amp; n. 15.<sup>[3]</sup> The court reasoned that because Brown would be judicially estopped from contradicting his prior representations anent the amount due on the Notes, his assignees should be similarly estopped. <i>Id.</i> at 32-36. The appellants say that Brown's representations cannot be imputed to them and that, therefore, judicial estoppel was incorrectly invoked.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> In examining these competing contentions, we take the underlying substantive law  the law of negotiable instruments  from Massachusetts. Under Massachusetts law, negotiable instruments, such as the Notes, are governed by Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, § 3-102. The U.C.C. states that a noteholder's right to enforce a note is subject to certain defenses. <i>Id.</i> § 3-305(a). These defenses include those enumerated in section 3-305(a)(1) (often termed \"real defenses\"), defenses specifically listed elsewhere in Article III, and defenses \"that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract\" (often termed \"personal defenses\"). <i>Id.</i> If a noteholder qualifies as a holder in due course, his right to enforce the note is subject only to real defenses. <i>Id.</i> § 3-305(b).</p>\n<p>The appellants do not presume to be holders in due course. <i>See Perry II,</i> slip op. at 12. Thus, they are subject to the axiom that the rights of a transferee who is not a holder in due course rise no higher than the rights of the transferor. <i>See</i> 2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 17-11, at 226 (5th ed. 2008). It follows that the appellants, as transferees, are subject to the trilogy of defenses described in section 3-305(a) to the same extent that those defenses would have been available against the transferor (Brown). <i>See id.</i>; <i>see also</i> 25 Herbert Lemelman, Massachusetts Practice § 3:150, at 428 (3d ed. 2002) (stating in essence that a holder who is not a holder in due course is treated under Massachusetts law as the assignee of a contract).</p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that the transferor and the transferee are to be treated as one and the same for all purposes. Of particular pertinence for present purposes, judicial estoppel does not fit comfortably within any of the trilogy of defenses described in section 3-305(a). Judicial estoppel is certainly not a \"real defense\" within the provision of the statute, nor is it a defense specifically listed anywhere in Article III of the U.C.C. This leaves only the category of \"personal defenses.\"</p>\n<p>Personal defenses typically are thought to be \"those based on common law contract principles.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, § 3-305(a) cmt. 2; <i>see </i><i>FDIC v. Wood,</i> 758 F.2d 156, 160 (6th Cir.1985) (\"`Personal' defenses, such as failure of consideration and usury . . . are defenses or claims stemming from the underlying transaction.\"). Judicial estoppel does not fit seamlessly into the taxonomy of personal defenses, as it is not a defense aimed directly at either the validity or the enforceability of a contract. Rather, it is a judge-made doctrine designed to protect the integrity of the judicial system. <i>See </i><i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808. This seeming incongruence gives us some pause about trying to ram the square peg of judicial estoppel into the round hole of personal defenses.</p>\n<p>Still, we recognize that the boundaries of judicial estoppel are hazy. It is conceivable that cases may arise in which the doctrine can be considered a personal defense, used to prevent a noteholder from playing fast and loose with the courts through, say, engaging a straw to assert a payoff amount contradictory to one earlier put forth by the noteholder himself. <i>See </i><i>G-I Holdings, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co.,</i> 586 F.3d 247, 262 (3d Cir.2009) (\"We will apply [judicial estoppel] to neutralize threats to judicial integrity however they may arise.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>FDIC v. Gulf Life Ins. Co.,</i> 737 F.2d 1513, 1518 (11th Cir.1984) (suggesting that, for negotiable instruments, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> general estoppel may constitute a personal defense, \"to which a holder in due course would be impregnable\"). The combinations of possible circumstances are infinitely varied, and a flat holding that judicial estoppel can be circumvented simply by transferring property to a third party would be folly. <i>See generally </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 87-88 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasizing utility of judicial estoppel as a means of preventing a party from obtaining an unfair advantage).</p>\n<p>Here, however, we need not grapple with the admittedly difficult question of whether judicial estoppel may ever qualify as a personal defense. In our view, the district court's application of judicial estoppel suffers from a different infirmity: Perry has failed to satisfy the second requirement for judicial estoppel. He has not shown that the bankruptcy court actually accepted Brown's representation of the value of the Notes.</p>\n<p>The party proposing an application of judicial estoppel must show that the relevant court actually accepted the other party's earlier representation. <i>See </i><i>Gens v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 112 F.3d 569, 572 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Judicial estoppel is not implicated unless the first forum <i>accepted</i> the legal or factual assertion alleged to be at odds with the position advanced in the current forum. . . .\" (emphasis in original)). \"Acceptance\" in this context is a term of art. In order to satisfy this prerequisite, a party need not show that the earlier representation led to a favorable ruling on the merits of the proceeding in which it was made, but must show that the court adopted and relied on the represented position either in a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pennycuff v. Fentress Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 404 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara,</i> 364 F.3d 274, 294 (5th Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Global NAPs,</i> 603 F.3d at 90 (finding that court accepted party's first representation by relying on it in granting temporary restraining order); <i>Alt. Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 34 (explaining that because court relied on party's initial position in denying motion to dismiss, party \"derived a direct (if temporary) benefit from its original position\").</p>\n<p>The showing of judicial acceptance must be a strong one. <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings, LLC v. Town of Westminster,</i> 547 F.3d 28, 37 &amp; n. 8 (1st Cir.2008) (rejecting judicial estoppel argument because record was unclear as to whether court accepted plaintiff's prior position); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Pakala,</i> 568 F.3d 47, 60 (1st Cir.2009) (upholding judicial estoppel when it was \"clearly obvious\" that the original trial court, in granting a motion, \"necessarily adopted\" the position that the movant later sought to contradict); <i>United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Spectrum Worldwide, Inc.,</i> 555 F.3d 772, 779 (9th Cir.2009) (authorizing judicial estoppel when trial court \"clearly accepted and relied upon [the party's] assertions\" when it denied preliminary injunction). The need for a strong showing derives from the maxim that \"[j]udicial estoppel is applied with caution to avoid impinging on the truth-seeking function of the court because the doctrine precludes a contradictory position without examining the truth of either statement.\" <i>Teledyne Indus., Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 911 F.2d 1214, 1218 (6th Cir. 1990); <i>accord </i><i>Lowery v. Stovall,</i> 92 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.1996) (\"The insistence upon a court having accepted the party's prior inconsistent position ensures that judicial estoppel is applied in the narrowest of circumstances.\").</p>\n<p>It follows that a proponent of judicial estoppel must affirmatively show, by competent evidence or inescapable inference, that the prior court adopted or relied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> upon the previous inconsistent assertion. <i>See </i><i>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Ret. Income Plan for Hourly-Rated Emps. of ASARCO, Inc.,</i> 512 F.3d 555, 563-64 (9th Cir.2008) (finding that failure to demonstrate judicial acceptance precludes application of estoppel where \"the district court never <i>held</i>\" the notion urged by the party) (emphasis in original); <i>United States v. Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d 786, 794 (1st Cir.1988) (rejecting \"illogical surmise\" about what prior court might have accepted as a basis for judicial estoppel). Perry has not made the requisite showing here.</p>\n<p>There are only two possible actions taken by the bankruptcy court that Brown's representation might have affected. First, in Brown's bankruptcy proceeding, the court allowed him to retain the Notes after he stated the amount due and represented that the Notes were uncollectible. Second, in the CHI bankruptcy (in which Brown intervened), the court lifted the automatic stay, allowing Brown to foreclose on the Fenmore. There is no evidence that either action was premised on Brown's statements about the amount owed on the Notes, and it is implausible to infer any such nexus.</p>\n<p>We examine these two actions in reverse order. It defies logic to deduce that the bankruptcy court granted Brown relief from the automatic stay on the basis of the amount owed on the Notes. A larger figure would not have supported keeping the stay in place  if anything, a greater amount owed would have created an additional incentive for the court to allow the foreclosure to proceed post-haste.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is utterly speculative to suggest that the bankruptcy court, in approving Brown's global settlement and allowing him to retain the Notes, accepted each and every one of his figures. Generally speaking, settlement \"neither requires nor implies any judicial endorsement of either party's claims or theories.\" <i>In re Bankvest Capital Corp.,</i> 375 F.3d 51, 60 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Bates v. Long Island R.R. Co.,</i> 997 F.2d 1028, 1038 (2d Cir.1993)). So viewed, an unexplained settlement does not provide the prior success necessary for judicial estoppel. <i>See </i><i>C &amp; M Props., LLC v. Burbidge,</i> 377 B.R. 677, 685 (D.Utah 2007) (noting that \"[t]he the fact that [debtor] obtained confirmation of its [plan] does not demonstrate that the bankruptcy court was misled\" and thus finding that second element of judicial estoppel was not satisfied), vacated on other grounds by <i>In re C &amp; M Props., L.L.C.,</i> 563 F.3d 1156, 1168 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Perry surmises, but offers no semblance of proof, that a bankruptcy court would treat uncollectible notes worth over $7,000,000 differently than uncollectible notes worth roughly $1,000,000. It is, of course, possible that, in particular circumstances, a bankruptcy court might indulge in such differential treatment. Here, however, the surmised inference is simply not plausible. By definition, an uncollectible note is an uncollectible note (and, thus, worthless). In any event, either of these figures pales in comparison to $134,105,736  the sum of the claims of Brown's creditors at the time of the settlement. In this case, then, the variation in amount is a distinction that makes no difference.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> For what it may be worth, Brown himself neither explicitly nor implicitly contradicted his original representation as to the amount due on the Notes. He placed that figure at $902,662 and later sold the Notes for a figure in the same ballpark  $950,000. These events do not support a suggestion that he was attempting to defraud or mislead the bankruptcy court. This is potentially important because judicial estoppel is not meant to be a trap for the unwary and should be employed sparingly when \"there is no evidence of intent to manipulate or mislead the courts.\" <i>Ryan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 355, 365 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily. Conjecture, without more, cannot support the application of judicial estoppel. <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings,</i> 547 F.3d at 37 &amp; n. 8. Put another way, remote possibilities are not enough. Consequently, we hold that the district court committed legal error (and, thus, abused its discretion) in judicially estopping the appellants, based on a third party's earlier representation, from attempting to prove that the amount due on the Notes was more than $1,853,282.</p>\n<p>In an effort to repair this hole in the fabric of their argument, Perry and CHI urge that the appellants should be judicially estopped based on Yellin's prior representation. The district court rejected this alternative theory, <i>Perry II,</i> slip op. at 10, and so do we.</p>\n<p>The salient facts are as follows. In 1997, Perry, on behalf of CHI, sued the appellants in a Massachusetts state court. He moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the Fenmore. As part of his opposition, Yellin filed an affidavit indicating, in its background recitals, that the amount due on the Notes was $1,900,000. The state court denied Perry's motion. Perry did not appeal the denial, and the court subsequently dismissed the case for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p>In the court below, Perry and CHI advanced an alternative claim of judicial estoppel premised on Yellin's affidavit. The district court did not bite, reasoning that the state court \"took no action in reliance on [the $1.9 million] figure\" and \"ultimately dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> Perry and CHI challenge this holding. Noting that the state court accepted the filing of Yellin's affidavit and denied the preliminary injunction, they say that no more was exigible to ground a subsequent claim of judicial estoppel. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>Based on the facts recounted above, the first element needed for judicial estoppel is satisfied. The representation about the Notes' value, as expressed by the appellants in the district court, is inconsistent with the earlier representation that Yellin made in the state court.</p>\n<p>Once again, however, the second element is more problematic. There is absolutely no basis for believing that the state court adopted or relied on the $1,900,000 figure contained in Yellin's affidavit. The absence of any evidence to that effect is fatal. <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings,</i> 547 F.3d at 37 &amp; n. 8; <i>Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d at 794.</p>\n<p>Perry and CHI suggest that the state court may have relied on Yellin's representation in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. But this suggestion is woven entirely out of gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. In addition, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> suggestion is counterintuitive. Perry and CHI sought the preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the Fenmore, and the amount of the indebtedness had virtually nothing to do with the question raised in that motion. In other words, whether the balance owed was $1,900,000 or $7,000,000 or some figure in between had no apparent bearing on whether the foreclosure should (or should not) be enjoined. <i>Cf. </i><i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (listing factors relevant to preliminary injunction inquiry). There is simply no plausible basis for supposing that Yellin's representation about the amount due factored into the state court's decisional calculus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Equity of Redemption.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Given our previous conclusion, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), the district court's accounting will have to be reworked. Once the amount due on the Notes is established and subtracted  after all, the Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the Fenmore and, thus, give rise to a high-priority equitable lien on the foreclosure proceeds  the question becomes how the court should treat the $5,000,000 paid to settle the FDIC's claims against the Yellin Parties. The appellants argue that this payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages and, thus, should be offset <i>before</i> calculating the equity of redemption. The district court made no such offset. The appellants assign error to this step in the progression.</p>\n<p>The calculation of an equitable accounting is, within broad limits, committed to the district court's discretion. <i>Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co.,</i> 282 F.3d 23, 39 (1st Cir.2002). Accordingly, \"we will not disturb [such a calculation] unless it rests on clearly erroneous findings of fact, incorrect legal standards, or a meaningful error in judgment.\" <i>Id.</i>; see <i>In re Blinds to Go Share Purchase Litig.,</i> 443 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Because the district court `is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal,' we will not normally find an abuse of discretion unless, upon whole-record review, we are convinced that the district court committed a significant error in judgment.\" (quoting <i>Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc))).</p>\n<p>As co-owners of the foreclosed Fenmore, Perry and Yellin are jointly entitled to the equity of redemption. Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the appellants' contention is that calculating this figure is a purely mechanical exercise, which requires that payments made to extinguish liens on the property be subtracted before the co-owners can divide the remaining foreclosure surplus. Building on this foundation, the appellants posit that the district court erred in refusing to offset the $5,000,000 payment that they made to the FDIC because that payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages on the Fenmore.</p>\n<p>This argument has a patina of plausibility. Under basic principles of property law, the holder of the equity of redemption does not have a property interest in foreclosure proceeds unless and until all outstanding liens on the property have been extinguished. <i>See </i><i>First Colonial Bank for Sav. v. Bergeron,</i> 38 Mass.App. Ct. 136, 646 N.E.2d 758, 759 (1995); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4 (1997) (\"When the foreclosure sale price exceeds the amount of the mortgage obligation, the surplus is applied to liens and other interests terminated by the foreclosure in order of their priority and the remaining balance, if any, is distributed to the holder of the equity of redemption.\"). A junior lienholder has an equitable lien, transferred from the foreclosed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> premises, that attaches to the foreclosure surplus. <i>See </i><i>New Haven Sav. Bank v. Follins,</i> 431 F.Supp.2d 183, 196 (D.Mass. 2006); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4, cmt. a (1997) (explaining that the \"surplus stands in the place of the foreclosed real estate, and the liens and interests that previously attached to the real estate now attach to the surplus\").</p>\n<p>The appellants take these abecedarian property law principles to mean that because they settled with the FDIC and thereby extinguished the FDIC's equitable lien on the foreclosure proceeds, the $5,000,000 settlement amount must come off the top before the equity of redemption is calculated. The district court instead treated the $5,000,000 as a part of the distribution of the appellants' share of the equity of redemption. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>\n<p>The appellants' construct reflects a kind of tunnel vision. It fails to take into consideration that the challenged calculations are not entries on a closing sheet at a foreclosure but, rather, are calculations made in the context of a judicial accounting. This matters because an accounting is not a rote exercise in arithmetic. To the contrary, it is an equitable remedy, <i>see </i><i>Braunstein v. McCabe,</i> 571 F.3d 108, 122 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg,</i> 492 U.S. 33, 49 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989)), and equitable remedies \"are flexible tools to be applied with the focus on fairness and justice.\" <i>Demoulas v. Demoulas,</i> 428 Mass. 555, 703 N.E.2d 1149, 1169 (1998) (citing 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 2.1(3), at 63 (2d ed. 1993)).</p>\n<p>The district court understood this distinction. It refused to offset the $5,000,000 settlement before calculating the equity of redemption. The court based this determination on a finding that the primary purpose of the settlement was not to extinguish the FDIC's lien, but to release the Yellins from personal liability on a wide range of loans (many of which were completely unrelated to the Fenmore). <i>See Perry III,</i> slip op. at 1. In effect, Yellin used money that otherwise would have had to be shared with Perry to defray his personal obligations, leaving Perry to settle separately with the FDIC using his own resources. <i>See supra</i> note 1. In the district court's words, Yellin \"ha[d] Blum conduct the Fenmore foreclosure sale and hand over the first $5 million in proceeds to the FDIC\" to satisfy Yellin's personal obligations. <i>See Perry III,</i> slip op. at 1. The court found that arrangement to be \"the product of precisely the improper relationship and underhanded dealings\" that characterized the appellants' course of conduct. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also Perry I,</i> slip op. at 13.</p>\n<p>This finding is eminently supportable. The only reason why Yellin was able to use foreclosure proceeds to fund his personal settlement was because of his relationship with Blum, who, as a straw for Yellin, held the senior mortgages on the Fenmore.</p>\n<p>In performing an equitable accounting, the district court is not a mere scrivener, charged with carrying out a ministerial task. Instead, the court is charged with tempering arithmetic with equity, or, as we phrased it in <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 323, \"bring[ing] the scales into balance.\" In this context, we think that the district court acted within the sphere of its discretion in preventing Yellin from unjustly enriching himself, to the detriment of his quondam partner, by what the district court warrantably found were underhanded dealings. <i>See</i> 1 Dobbs, <i>supra,</i> § 4.3(5), at 610 (explaining that an accounting \"forces the fiduciary defendant to disgorge gains received from improper use of the plaintiff's property or entitlements\"). Accordingly, we hold that the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> neither erred nor abused its discretion in refusing to subtract the $5,000,000 payment before calculating the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Joinder.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Yellins claim that the district court violated the Due Process Clause by joining them as reach-and-apply defendants after the trial had ended. A few additional facts are needed to bring the claim into perspective.</p>\n<p>When the FDIC originally filed a claim in the underlying litigation, it named the Yellins, among others, as defendants. But following the settlement of the FDIC's claims against them, the Yellins were dropped from the suit on June 10, 2002. Two days later, Perry brought Blum, as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust, back into the case by filing a cross-claim against him. The cross-claim did not specifically name the Yellins, but it did name \"John Doe\" as a reach-and-apply defendant. \"John Doe\" was described as \"a person or persons, or an entity or entities, to whom funds generated by the foreclosure sale of the Fenmore have been transferred by Blum, for less than full consideration.\"</p>\n<p>Almost two years later, Perry sought to amend his cross-claim to add the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. The district court referred this motion to a magistrate judge. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). On November 29, 2004, the magistrate judge denied it. Perry moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration but did not appeal that denial to the district judge.</p>\n<p>The cross-claim was tried to the court in early 2005. During trial, Perry again moved to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. The district court suggested that Perry file a written motion to conform the pleadings to the proof. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). Perry filed such a motion on June 24, 2005. The district court took the entire case (including the motion) under advisement for over three years.</p>\n<p>On October 31, 2008, the court issued its written decision. In that rescript, the court granted the motion to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 36. The Yellins sought reconsideration, to no avail. <i>Perry II,</i> slip op. at 19.</p>\n<p>The district court premised its order on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.<sup>[5]</sup> We review an order joining a party under Rule 21 for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cornelius v. Hogan,</i> 663 F.2d 330, 335 (1st Cir.1981). Within that rubric, embedded legal questions are reviewed de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Platte,</i> 577 F.3d 387, 391 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Rule 21 stated that \"[p]arties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\" Although the rule permits joinder at any stage of the proceedings, joinder in a particular case must comport with the strictures of due process. <i>Moore v. Knowles,</i> 482 F.2d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1973). These strictures include notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <i>Eakins v. Reed,</i> 710 F.2d 184, 186-87 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, joinder of a defendant after trial is disfavored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabrera v. Mun'y of Bayamon,</i> 622 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1980). In such a situation, concerns about possible prejudice to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> the late-joined party loom large. 7 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1688.1, at 510 (3d ed. 2001).</p>\n<p>The case at bar, however, is highly idiosyncratic. First, the Yellins originally were parties to the action. Second, they were on notice of Perry's desire to add them as defendants by reason of both his pretrial motion to do so and his mid-trial motion to that effect. Third, in his original cross-claim, Perry named a \"John Doe\" reach-and-apply defendant, describing \"John Doe\" in terms that fit the Yellins to a \"T.\" These circumstances gave the district court an adequate basis for finding that the Yellins had notice sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. <i>See </i><i>Insituform Techs., Inc. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.,</i> 385 F.3d 1360, 1375 (Fed. Cir.2004) (rejecting defendant's due process argument against post-trial joinder because plaintiffs had made pretrial attempts to join him).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the record permits a conclusion that the Yellins had a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Blum was a party all along, and the district court supportably found that he was a stand-in for the Yellins. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 11-12. As such, Blum had substantially the same interests as the Yellins. Blum was their proxy and, as befits a proxy, he and the Yellins shared the same counsel.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>To add to the picture, the Yellins testified extensively at the trial. Consequently, their narrative accounts of the central issues in the case were before the court. That is an important consideration in the due process equation. <i>See </i><i>Fromson v. Citiplate, Inc.,</i> 886 F.2d 1300, 1304 (Fed. Cir.1989) (upholding post-judgment joinder where interests of late-joined defendant and timely-joined defendants were \"virtually complete\").</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, a party who claims to be aggrieved by a violation of procedural due process must show prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Amouri v. Holder,</i> 572 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d 754, 770-71 (1st Cir.1995). The Yellins have not identified any evidence which, had they been joined earlier, they could have introduced; nor have they made any other showing of actual prejudice.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This is a complicated, hard-fought case. Both sides are represented by highly proficient counsel, but objective appraisals of the facts are to some extent held hostage to the parties' rancor. The district judge has demonstrated patience and skill in sorting out what really happened and navigating through a legal minefield. We are reluctant to prolong a case that already has lingered for a decade, but there is no other principled course available to us. Perhaps, given the passage of time and the large sums already spent on litigation, the parties have reached a point at which a negotiated resolution of their remaining differences is possible. One can only hope.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel to limit the appellants' proof as to the amount owed on the Notes. Thus, we reverse that ruling. In turn, this holding requires vacation of the judgment. The district court will have to determine the actual amount due on the Notes at the relevant time and rework the accounting. We take no view as to the amount due on the Notes; although the appellants assert that the amount due is $7,494,435, Perry and CHI fiercely dispute the basis for that figure.</p>\n<p>The other rulings appealed from are affirmed, and further proceedings in the district court shall be conducted consistent with this opinion. On remand, the district court may take such further evidence as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated, and remanded.</i> All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix</i></h2>\n<p>The district court entered a judgment in favor of Perry in the amount of $4,347,126. This amount was calculated as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n    <i>Combined Proceeds from the Fenmore:</i>\n    Proceeds from foreclosure sale              $ 9,450,000\n    Net rents collected on the Fenmore          $ 1,660,797\n                                                ___________\n    Net combined proceeds                       $11,110,797\n    <i>Credits, Adjustments, and Amount Due on Notes:</i>\n    Costs of foreclosure                         $  154,440\n    Amount due on Notes as of foreclosure\n     date                                        $2,262,105\n                                                ___________\n    Total credits and adjustments                $2,416,545\n    <i>Equity of Redemption:</i>\n    Net combined proceeds                       $11,110,797\n    Less credits and adjustments               -$ 2,416,545\n    Fenmore's equity of redemption              $ 8,694,252\n                                               ____________\n    Perry's 50% share                           $ 4,347,126\n</pre>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The FDIC settled separately with the Perry Parties in November of 2005. The settlement totaled $6,625,000.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court also addressed Perry's argument that the Notes were discharged (and, thus, the amount due was zero). The court held that this argument was barred by res judicata: the dismissal of CHI's state court action precluded Perry from litigating the discharged claim. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 20-27. This ruling is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court also mentioned approvingly the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>In re Coastal Plains, Inc.,</i> 179 F.3d 197 (5th Cir. 1999), for the proposition that a third party's misrepresentation may be used to estop an unrelated party. <i>Perry II,</i> slip op. at 11. <i>Coastal Plains</i> did not involve unrelated parties, <i>see</i> 179 F.3d at 203, 213, and in any event, its authority on this specification is suspect. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Biesek v. Soo Line R.R. Co.,</i> 440 F.3d 410, 412-13 (7th Cir.2006) (declining to follow <i>Coastal Plains</i>); <i>In re Riazuddin,</i> 363 B.R. 177, 188 &amp; n. 53 (10th Cir.BAP 2007) (same). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself has distinguished <i>Coastal Plains,</i> based on its unique facts. <i>See </i><i>Kane v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 535 F.3d 380, 387 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that one court has treated settlements in ordinary litigation and those arising in the context of bankruptcy proceedings differently. <i>Reynolds v. Comm'r,</i> 861 F.2d 469, 473 (6th Cir.1988) (explaining that bankruptcy may give rise to greater judicial acceptance of the parties' positions because the court there \"is charged with an affirmative obligation to apprise itself of the underlying facts and to make an independent judgment as to whether the compromise is fair and equitable\"). We need not comment upon the correctness of this approach as Perry has offered nothing more than speculation to suggest that the bankruptcy court was motivated by the amount due on the Notes, rather than their uncollectible status. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 473-74 (noting that the accepted representation \"was <i>essential</i> to the bankruptcy judge's approval of the parties' compromise\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 21 was amended in 2007, but the changes were merely stylistic. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 21 advisory committee's note. Consequently, we refer here to the rule as it stood at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p>[6]  This is not a situation in which, as in <i>Eakins,</i> 710 F.2d at 187, a late-joined party and a timely-joined party shared the same counsel but had interests that were not \"sufficiently identical.\" In this instance, the identity of interests is palpable.</p>\n<p>[7]  In all events, any possible prejudice can be avoided here. If the Yellins have any evidence that bears on the accounting, the present posture of this case affords the district court the flexibility, when the case is returned to it, to reopen the case and provide the Yellins with an opportunity to supplement the record.</p>\n\n</div>",

To solve this conundrum, we must answer three loosely related questions. The first concerns the applicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the second concerns the way in which the methodology for calculating the equity of redemption fits within the framework of a judicial accounting, and the third concerns the propriety of a post-trial joinder of additional defendants. After careful consideration of these questions, we reject the district court's proposed application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel but uphold its treatment of the equity of redemption and its joinder order. When all is said and done, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Although there is a long, convoluted, and sometimes Machiavellian history involving the protagonists, we relate here only those facts relevant to the issues presented on appeal. We supplement this account in connection with our discussion of particular issues. Throughout, we accept the district court's factual findings to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous. <i>Limone v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Cumpiano v.

The purchase price included two promissory notes, with an aggregate face value of approximately $11,000,000 (the Notes), executed by Perry and Yellin as co-makers. The Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the property.</p>\n<p>Over time, Perry and Yellin made payments on the Notes. But when the Boston real estate market cratered in the late 1980s, they defaulted on several obligations, including not only the Notes but also an array of loans from their primary lender, Capitol Bank (which, among other things, held a third mortgage on the Fenmore). By 1990, Perry and Yellin owed Capitol Bank more than $7,000,000. They negotiated a settlement with the bank in July of that year, but the settlement proved to be illusory. The bank subsequently repudiated it, and Perry and Yellin were forced to sue for specific performance in a Massachusetts state court.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> During the currency of that suit, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Capitol Bank as its receiver and liquidating agent. The FDIC sought to collect Perry's and Yellin's indebtedness to the bank, claiming that they owed roughly $19,000,000 in principal and accrued interest on various loans. As part of its collection effort, the FDIC disavowed the earlier settlement and, in January of 1999, filed an amended counterclaim in the state court suit.</p>\n<p>The amended counterclaim named as defendants Perry, Yellin, and a number of their relatives. These additional defendants (whom we shall call the \"Perry Parties\" and the \"Yellin Parties\") were allegedly involved in Perry's and Yellin's real estate enterprises as \"straws.\" In due season, the FDIC removed the state court action to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>Brown's fortunes also had been adversely affected by the slumping real estate market. In 1991, he filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy proceedings dragged on and, in August of 1996, he submitted an affidavit to the bankruptcy court in which he represented that the Notes had an unpaid balance of $902,662 and were uncollectible. The bankruptcy court granted Brown a discharge from bankruptcy in September of 1996 and permitted him to retain ownership of the Notes.</p>\n<p>CHI went into bankruptcy in April of 1996. After Brown emerged from his own bankruptcy, he intervened in CHI's bankruptcy and requested relief from the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362, so that he could foreclose on the Fenmore. Brown represented that the Notes had a principal balance of $902,662 and past-due interest of $950,620. The bankruptcy court granted Brown's motion to lift the stay in December of 1996. Instead of foreclosing, however, Brown agreed to sell the Notes to Yellin for $950,000. Yellin effectuated this purchase behind Perry's back and through a straw: Steven Blum, in his capacity as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust. The sole beneficiary of the trust was North Shore Renewal, Inc., a shell corporation wholly owned by Yellin's wife, Elaine. Yellin, acting through Blum, then took control of the Fenmore as a mortgagee-in-possession and began collecting rents.</p>\n<p>In June of 1997, Perry, on behalf of CHI, sued the Yellins and Blum, individually and as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust, in a Massachusetts state court. The suit alleged an alphabet of wrongdoing, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and conversion, stemming from the purchase of the Notes. In October of 1998, after Perry failed to attend a pretrial conference, the state court dismissed the suit for want of prosecution. <i>CHI v. Blum,</i> No. 97-3007 (Mass.Dist.Ct. Oct. 7, 1998) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p>In late 1997, Yellin, acting through Blum, commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the Fenmore. The FDIC, which held junior mortgages on the property as the receiver for Capitol Bank, responded by bringing an action in the federal district court. In the action, the FDIC sought to enjoin any foreclosure sale. The district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the foreclosure sale. Later, it consolidated the action in which it had granted the injunction with the action that the FDIC had removed from the state court.</p>\n<p>In 2002, Yellin and the Yellin Parties settled with the FDIC for $5,000,000. Under the terms of the settlement, the FDIC permitted Yellin, acting through Blum, to foreclose on the Fenmore and use the first $5,000,000 of the foreclosure proceeds to fund the settlement. The district court thereafter dissolved the existing injunction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> and Blum foreclosed on the Fenmore. The apartment complex was sold at auction for $9,450,000 (ironically, to Brown). The FDIC and the Yellin Parties then jointly moved to dismiss all claims inter sese. The district court granted that motion on June 10, 2002.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Following the foreclosure sale, Perry, on behalf of himself and CHI, cross-claimed against Blum for an accounting of both the foreclosure proceeds and all rents collected between 1996 and 2002. Perry alleged that, as an equal partner in CHI, he was entitled to one-half of the Fenmore's equity of redemption.</p>\n<p>In February and March of 2005, the district court held a bench trial on the cross-claim. The Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the Fenmore, so Blum, as the noteholder and as a straw for Yellin, had a priority claim to the foreclosure proceeds. Not surprisingly, then, one of the main issues at trial concerned the amount due on the Notes. Blum contended that $7,494,435 was due. Perry contended that the amount due was much less. The district court determined that Blum was estopped from asserting that the amount due was anything other than what Brown, Blum's predecessor-in-interest, had represented in the bankruptcy court, namely, $1,853,282. <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry I</i>), No. 99-12194, slip op. at 30 (D.Mass. Oct. 31, 2008).<sup>[2]</sup> Even though the trial had ended years earlier, the court granted Perry's motion to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 36.</p>\n<p>Before the court actually made a final accounting, Blum and the Yellins moved for reconsideration of <i>Perry I,</i> arguing that the court had erred in applying judicial estoppel and in joining the Yellins after trial. The court denied the motion, <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry II</i>), No. 99-12194, slip op. at 2 (D. Mass. June 2, 2009). The court then prepared the accounting and entered judgment for Perry against Blum and the Yellins in the sum of $4,347,126, plus pre-judgment interest. The appendix to this opinion delineates the manner in which the court calculated this amount.</p>\n<p>Blum and the Yellins moved to alter or amend the judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), protesting that the court had erred in excluding from its calculation of the equity of redemption an offset for the $5,000,000 payment that the Yellins had made to the FDIC  an offset that would have had the effect of reducing Perry's award by $2,500,000. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that it would be inequitable to allow Yellin to settle his personal debts by using foreclosure proceeds that otherwise would have to be split with Perry. <i>Perry v. Blum</i> (<i>Perry III</i>), No. 99-12194 (D. Mass. June 18, 2009) (unpublished order). Blum and the Yellins filed a timely motion of appeal from both the final judgment and the denial of their Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Like a milking stool, this appeal rests on three legs. The appellants (Blum and the Yellins) insist that the district court erred in (i) invoking judicial estoppel, (ii) miscalculating the equity of redemption, and (iii) adding the Yellins as defendants after the trial had ended. We discuss each of these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> arguments separately. Before doing so, however, we pause to make a point about choice of law.</p>\n<p>Due to the FDIC's involvement, this case had its roots in federal question jurisdiction. 12 U.S.C. § 1819(b)(2)(A); 28 U.S.C. § 1331. But the FDIC has departed from the scene, and the remaining claims are cognizable only under supplemental jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Where, as here, a federal court proceeds under supplemental jurisdiction, it is obliged to apply federal procedural law and state substantive law. <i>Hoyos v.

To the extent that procedural issues loom, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide the beacon by which we must steer.</p>\n<p>Most of the components of the appellants' asseverational array raise substantive questions and, thus, require us to apply Massachusetts law. Withal, one of the issues presents a thorny problem of classification, which this court has not resolved: Is judicial estoppel procedural (and, thus, governed by federal law) or substantive (and, thus, governed by state law)?</p>\n<p>This is an interesting Rubik's cube, but we need not provide a definitive answer here. The parties and the district court all assumed that federal standards of judicial estoppel governed, and the case has been briefed and argued on the same assumption. In such circumstances, we may hold the parties to their plausible choice of law, whether or not that choice is correct. <i>See </i><i>Thore v.

Courts normally refuse to apply judicial estoppel to one party based on the representations of an unrelated party. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Parker v.

Nevertheless, courts sometimes have allowed judicial estoppel when the estopped party was responsible in fact for the earlier representation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ladd v. ITT Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755615\"><a href=\"/opinion/755615/rebecca-ladd-v-itt-corporation-and-metropolitan-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 756 (7th Cir.1998), or when the estopped party was the assignee of a litigation claim or assumed the original party's role, <i>see</i> 18B Wright et al., <i>supra,</i> § 4477, at 618-19.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court determined that the appellants (Blum and the Yellins) should be judicially estopped from asserting that the amount due on the Notes was $7,494,435 because a third party, Brown, had represented in his own bankruptcy proceeding that the unpaid balance was a mere $902,662, and had represented in CHI's bankruptcy that the total amount due on the Notes (including accrued interest) was $1,853,282. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 30. The court bound the appellants to Brown's earlier representations primarily on the theory that the appellants, as purchasers of the Notes, were subject to any defenses that Perry and CHI could have asserted against Brown himself. <i>Id.</i> at 31 &amp; n. 15.<sup>[3]</sup> The court reasoned that because Brown would be judicially estopped from contradicting his prior representations anent the amount due on the Notes, his assignees should be similarly estopped. <i>Id.</i> at 32-36. The appellants say that Brown's representations cannot be imputed to them and that, therefore, judicial estoppel was incorrectly invoked.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> In examining these competing contentions, we take the underlying substantive law  the law of negotiable instruments  from Massachusetts. Under Massachusetts law, negotiable instruments, such as the Notes, are governed by Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, § 3-102. The U.C.C. states that a noteholder's right to enforce a note is subject to certain defenses. <i>Id.</i> § 3-305(a). These defenses include those enumerated in section 3-305(a)(1) (often termed \"real defenses\"), defenses specifically listed elsewhere in Article III, and defenses \"that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract\" (often termed \"personal defenses\"). <i>Id.</i> If a noteholder qualifies as a holder in due course, his right to enforce the note is subject only to real defenses. <i>Id.</i> § 3-305(b).</p>\n<p>The appellants do not presume to be holders in due course. <i>See Perry II,</i> slip op. at 12. Thus, they are subject to the axiom that the rights of a transferee who is not a holder in due course rise no higher than the rights of the transferor. <i>See</i> 2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code § 17-11, at 226 (5th ed. 2008). It follows that the appellants, as transferees, are subject to the trilogy of defenses described in section 3-305(a) to the same extent that those defenses would have been available against the transferor (Brown). <i>See id.</i>; <i>see also</i> 25 Herbert Lemelman, Massachusetts Practice § 3:150, at 428 (3d ed. 2002) (stating in essence that a holder who is not a holder in due course is treated under Massachusetts law as the assignee of a contract).</p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that the transferor and the transferee are to be treated as one and the same for all purposes. Of particular pertinence for present purposes, judicial estoppel does not fit comfortably within any of the trilogy of defenses described in section 3-305(a). Judicial estoppel is certainly not a \"real defense\" within the provision of the statute, nor is it a defense specifically listed anywhere in Article III of the U.C.C. This leaves only the category of \"personal defenses.\"</p>\n<p>Personal defenses typically are thought to be \"those based on common law contract principles.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, § 3-305(a) cmt. 2; <i>see </i><i>FDIC v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449703\"><a href=\"/opinion/449703/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-in-its-corporate-capacity-v-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 160 (6th Cir.1985) (\"`Personal' defenses, such as failure of consideration and usury . . . are defenses or claims stemming from the underlying transaction.\"). Judicial estoppel does not fit seamlessly into the taxonomy of personal defenses, as it is not a defense aimed directly at either the validity or the enforceability of a contract. Rather, it is a judge-made doctrine designed to protect the integrity of the judicial system. <i>See </i><i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 749, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1808</span></a></span>. This seeming incongruence gives us some pause about trying to ram the square peg of judicial estoppel into the round hole of personal defenses.</p>\n<p>Still, we recognize that the boundaries of judicial estoppel are hazy. It is conceivable that cases may arise in which the doctrine can be considered a personal defense, used to prevent a noteholder from playing fast and loose with the courts through, say, engaging a straw to assert a payoff amount contradictory to one earlier put forth by the noteholder himself. <i>See </i><i>G-I Holdings, Inc. v.

The combinations of possible circumstances are infinitely varied, and a flat holding that judicial estoppel can be circumvented simply by transferring property to a third party would be folly. <i>See generally </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87-88 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasizing utility of judicial estoppel as a means of preventing a party from obtaining an unfair advantage).</p>\n<p>Here, however, we need not grapple with the admittedly difficult question of whether judicial estoppel may ever qualify as a personal defense. In our view, the district court's application of judicial estoppel suffers from a different infirmity: Perry has failed to satisfy the second requirement for judicial estoppel. He has not shown that the bankruptcy court actually accepted Brown's representation of the value of the Notes.</p>\n<p>The party proposing an application of judicial estoppel must show that the relevant court actually accepted the other party's earlier representation. <i>See </i><i>Gens v.

In order to satisfy this prerequisite, a party need not show that the earlier representation led to a favorable ruling on the merits of the proceeding in which it was made, but must show that the court adopted and relied on the represented position either in a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pennycuff v.

Perry has not made the requisite showing here.</p>\n<p>There are only two possible actions taken by the bankruptcy court that Brown's representation might have affected. First, in Brown's bankruptcy proceeding, the court allowed him to retain the Notes after he stated the amount due and represented that the Notes were uncollectible. Second, in the CHI bankruptcy (in which Brown intervened), the court lifted the automatic stay, allowing Brown to foreclose on the Fenmore. There is no evidence that either action was premised on Brown's statements about the amount owed on the Notes, and it is implausible to infer any such nexus.</p>\n<p>We examine these two actions in reverse order. It defies logic to deduce that the bankruptcy court granted Brown relief from the automatic stay on the basis of the amount owed on the Notes. A larger figure would not have supported keeping the stay in place  if anything, a greater amount owed would have created an additional incentive for the court to allow the foreclosure to proceed post-haste.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is utterly speculative to suggest that the bankruptcy court, in approving Brown's global settlement and allowing him to retain the Notes, accepted each and every one of his figures.

It is, of course, possible that, in particular circumstances, a bankruptcy court might indulge in such differential treatment. Here, however, the surmised inference is simply not plausible. By definition, an uncollectible note is an uncollectible note (and, thus, worthless). In any event, either of these figures pales in comparison to $134,105,736  the sum of the claims of Brown's creditors at the time of the settlement. In this case, then, the variation in amount is a distinction that makes no difference.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> For what it may be worth, Brown himself neither explicitly nor implicitly contradicted his original representation as to the amount due on the Notes. He placed that figure at $902,662 and later sold the Notes for a figure in the same ballpark  $950,000. These events do not support a suggestion that he was attempting to defraud or mislead the bankruptcy court.

Conjecture, without more, cannot support the application of judicial estoppel. <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings,</i> 547 F.3d at 37 &amp; n. 8. Put another way, remote possibilities are not enough. Consequently, we hold that the district court committed legal error (and, thus, abused its discretion) in judicially estopping the appellants, based on a third party's earlier representation, from attempting to prove that the amount due on the Notes was more than $1,853,282.</p>\n<p>In an effort to repair this hole in the fabric of their argument, Perry and CHI urge that the appellants should be judicially estopped based on Yellin's prior representation. The district court rejected this alternative theory, <i>Perry II,</i> slip op. at 10, and so do we.</p>\n<p>The salient facts are as follows. In 1997, Perry, on behalf of CHI, sued the appellants in a Massachusetts state court. He moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the Fenmore. As part of his opposition, Yellin filed an affidavit indicating, in its background recitals, that the amount due on the Notes was $1,900,000. The state court denied Perry's motion. Perry did not appeal the denial, and the court subsequently dismissed the case for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p>In the court below, Perry and CHI advanced an alternative claim of judicial estoppel premised on Yellin's affidavit. The district court did not bite, reasoning that the state court \"took no action in reliance on [the $1.9 million] figure\" and \"ultimately dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> Perry and CHI challenge this holding. Noting that the state court accepted the filing of Yellin's affidavit and denied the preliminary injunction, they say that no more was exigible to ground a subsequent claim of judicial estoppel. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>Based on the facts recounted above, the first element needed for judicial estoppel is satisfied. The representation about the Notes' value, as expressed by the appellants in the district court, is inconsistent with the earlier representation that Yellin made in the state court.</p>\n<p>Once again, however, the second element is more problematic. There is absolutely no basis for believing that the state court adopted or relied on the $1,900,000 figure contained in Yellin's affidavit. The absence of any evidence to that effect is fatal. <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings,</i> 547 F.3d at 37 &amp; n. 8; <i>Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d at 794.</p>\n<p>Perry and CHI suggest that the state court may have relied on Yellin's representation in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. But this suggestion is woven entirely out of gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. In addition, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> suggestion is counterintuitive. Perry and CHI sought the preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the Fenmore, and the amount of the indebtedness had virtually nothing to do with the question raised in that motion. In other words, whether the balance owed was $1,900,000 or $7,000,000 or some figure in between had no apparent bearing on whether the foreclosure should (or should not) be enjoined. <i>Cf. </i><i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (listing factors relevant to preliminary injunction inquiry). There is simply no plausible basis for supposing that Yellin's representation about the amount due factored into the state court's decisional calculus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Equity of Redemption.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Given our previous conclusion, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), the district court's accounting will have to be reworked. Once the amount due on the Notes is established and subtracted  after all, the Notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the Fenmore and, thus, give rise to a high-priority equitable lien on the foreclosure proceeds  the question becomes how the court should treat the $5,000,000 paid to settle the FDIC's claims against the Yellin Parties. The appellants argue that this payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages and, thus, should be offset <i>before</i> calculating the equity of redemption. The district court made no such offset. The appellants assign error to this step in the progression.</p>\n<p>The calculation of an equitable accounting is, within broad limits, committed to the district court's discretion. <i>Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2002). Accordingly, \"we will not disturb [such a calculation] unless it rests on clearly erroneous findings of fact, incorrect legal standards, or a meaningful error in judgment.\" <i>Id.</i>; see <i>In re Blinds to Go Share Purchase Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793856\"><a href=\"/opinion/793856/in-re-blinds-to-go-share-purchase-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Because the district court `is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal,' we will not normally find an abuse of discretion unless, upon whole-record review, we are convinced that the district court committed a significant error in judgment.\" (quoting <i>Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532023\"><a href=\"/opinion/532023/miguel-a-rosario-torres-v-rafael-hernandez-colon-etc-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc))).</p>\n<p>As co-owners of the foreclosed Fenmore, Perry and Yellin are jointly entitled to the equity of redemption. Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the appellants' contention is that calculating this figure is a purely mechanical exercise, which requires that payments made to extinguish liens on the property be subtracted before the co-owners can divide the remaining foreclosure surplus. Building on this foundation, the appellants posit that the district court erred in refusing to offset the $5,000,000 payment that they made to the FDIC because that payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages on the Fenmore.</p>\n<p>This argument has a patina of plausibility. Under basic principles of property law, the holder of the equity of redemption does not have a property interest in foreclosure proceeds unless and until all outstanding liens on the property have been extinguished. <i>See </i><i>First Colonial Bank for Sav. v. Bergeron,</i> 38 Mass.App. Ct. 136, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span>, 759 (1995); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4 (1997) (\"When the foreclosure sale price exceeds the amount of the mortgage obligation, the surplus is applied to liens and other interests terminated by the foreclosure in order of their priority and the remaining balance, if any, is distributed to the holder of the equity of redemption.\"). A junior lienholder has an equitable lien, transferred from the foreclosed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> premises, that attaches to the foreclosure surplus. <i>See </i><i>New Haven Sav. Bank v. Follins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335301/new-haven-savings-bank-v-follins/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 196 (D.Mass. 2006); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Mortgages § 7.4, cmt. a (1997) (explaining that the \"surplus stands in the place of the foreclosed real estate, and the liens and interests that previously attached to the real estate now attach to the surplus\").</p>\n<p>The appellants take these abecedarian property law principles to mean that because they settled with the FDIC and thereby extinguished the FDIC's equitable lien on the foreclosure proceeds, the $5,000,000 settlement amount must come off the top before the equity of redemption is calculated. The district court instead treated the $5,000,000 as a part of the distribution of the appellants' share of the equity of redemption. <i>See</i> Appendix.</p>\n<p>The appellants' construct reflects a kind of tunnel vision. It fails to take into consideration that the challenged calculations are not entries on a closing sheet at a foreclosure but, rather, are calculations made in the context of a judicial accounting. This matters because an accounting is not a rote exercise in arithmetic. To the contrary, it is an equitable remedy, <i>see </i><i>Braunstein v. McCabe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203890\"><a href=\"/opinion/203890/braunstein-v-mccabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Granfinanciera, S.A. v.

Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 2.1(3), at 63 (2d ed. 1993)).</p>\n<p>The district court understood this distinction. It refused to offset the $5,000,000 settlement before calculating the equity of redemption. The court based this determination on a finding that the primary purpose of the settlement was not to extinguish the FDIC's lien, but to release the Yellins from personal liability on a wide range of loans (many of which were completely unrelated to the Fenmore). <i>See Perry III,</i> slip op. at 1. In effect, Yellin used money that otherwise would have had to be shared with Perry to defray his personal obligations, leaving Perry to settle separately with the FDIC using his own resources. <i>See supra</i> note 1. In the district court's words, Yellin \"ha[d] Blum conduct the Fenmore foreclosure sale and hand over the first $5 million in proceeds to the FDIC\" to satisfy Yellin's personal obligations. <i>See Perry III,</i> slip op. at 1. The court found that arrangement to be \"the product of precisely the improper relationship and underhanded dealings\" that characterized the appellants' course of conduct. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also Perry I,</i> slip op. at 13.</p>\n<p>This finding is eminently supportable. The only reason why Yellin was able to use foreclosure proceeds to fund his personal settlement was because of his relationship with Blum, who, as a straw for Yellin, held the senior mortgages on the Fenmore.</p>\n<p>In performing an equitable accounting, the district court is not a mere scrivener, charged with carrying out a ministerial task. Instead, the court is charged with tempering arithmetic with equity, or, as we phrased it in <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 323, \"bring[ing] the scales into balance.\" In this context, we think that the district court acted within the sphere of its discretion in preventing Yellin from unjustly enriching himself, to the detriment of his quondam partner, by what the district court warrantably found were underhanded dealings. <i>See</i> 1 Dobbs, <i>supra,</i> § 4.3(5), at 610 (explaining that an accounting \"forces the fiduciary defendant to disgorge gains received from improper use of the plaintiff's property or entitlements\"). Accordingly, we hold that the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> neither erred nor abused its discretion in refusing to subtract the $5,000,000 payment before calculating the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Joinder.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Yellins claim that the district court violated the Due Process Clause by joining them as reach-and-apply defendants after the trial had ended. A few additional facts are needed to bring the claim into perspective.</p>\n<p>When the FDIC originally filed a claim in the underlying litigation, it named the Yellins, among others, as defendants. But following the settlement of the FDIC's claims against them, the Yellins were dropped from the suit on June 10, 2002. Two days later, Perry brought Blum, as trustee of Moorings Nominee Trust, back into the case by filing a cross-claim against him. The cross-claim did not specifically name the Yellins, but it did name \"John Doe\" as a reach-and-apply defendant. \"John Doe\" was described as \"a person or persons, or an entity or entities, to whom funds generated by the foreclosure sale of the Fenmore have been transferred by Blum, for less than full consideration.\"</p>\n<p>Almost two years later, Perry sought to amend his cross-claim to add the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. The district court referred this motion to a magistrate judge. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). On November 29, 2004, the magistrate judge denied it. Perry moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration but did not appeal that denial to the district judge.</p>\n<p>The cross-claim was tried to the court in early 2005. During trial, Perry again moved to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. The district court suggested that Perry file a written motion to conform the pleadings to the proof. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). Perry filed such a motion on June 24, 2005. The district court took the entire case (including the motion) under advisement for over three years.</p>\n<p>On October 31, 2008, the court issued its written decision. In that rescript, the court granted the motion to join the Yellins as reach-and-apply defendants. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 36. The Yellins sought reconsideration, to no avail. <i>Perry II,</i> slip op. at 19.</p>\n<p>The district court premised its order on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.<sup>[5]</sup> We review an order joining a party under Rule 21 for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cornelius v. Hogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396511\"><a href=\"/opinion/396511/cora-cornelius-v-william-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.1981).

Knowles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312800\"><a href=\"/opinion/312800/h-l-moore-plaintiff-appellee-cross-v-j-c-knowles/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1075 (5th Cir.1973). These strictures include notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <i>Eakins v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420723\"><a href=\"/opinion/420723/gary-eakins-v-amos-reed-samuel-p-garrison-and-robert-l-hinton-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 186-87 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, joinder of a defendant after trial is disfavored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabrera v. Mun'y of Bayamon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378217\"><a href=\"/opinion/378217/jose-ortega-cabrera-v-municipality-of-bayamon-jose-ortega-cabrera-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1980). In such a situation, concerns about possible prejudice to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> the late-joined party loom large. 7 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1688.1, at 510 (3d ed. 2001).</p>\n<p>The case at bar, however, is highly idiosyncratic. First, the Yellins originally were parties to the action. Second, they were on notice of Perry's desire to add them as defendants by reason of both his pretrial motion to do so and his mid-trial motion to that effect. Third, in his original cross-claim, Perry named a \"John Doe\" reach-and-apply defendant, describing \"John Doe\" in terms that fit the Yellins to a \"T.\" These circumstances gave the district court an adequate basis for finding that the Yellins had notice sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. <i>See </i><i>Insituform Techs., Inc. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788041\"><a href=\"/opinion/788041/insituform-technologies-inc-insituform-netherlands-b-v-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1360</span></a></span>, 1375 (Fed. Cir.2004) (rejecting defendant's due process argument against post-trial joinder because plaintiffs had made pretrial attempts to join him).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the record permits a conclusion that the Yellins had a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Blum was a party all along, and the district court supportably found that he was a stand-in for the Yellins. <i>Perry I,</i> slip op. at 11-12. As such, Blum had substantially the same interests as the Yellins. Blum was their proxy and, as befits a proxy, he and the Yellins shared the same counsel.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>To add to the picture, the Yellins testified extensively at the trial. Consequently, their narrative accounts of the central issues in the case were before the court. That is an important consideration in the due process equation. <i>See </i><i>Fromson v. Citiplate, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530053\"><a href=\"/opinion/530053/howard-a-fromson-v-citiplate-inc-charles-cusumano-and-joseph-cusumano/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, 1304 (Fed. Cir.1989) (upholding post-judgment joinder where interests of late-joined defendant and timely-joined defendants were \"virtually complete\").</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, a party who claims to be aggrieved by a violation of procedural due process must show prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Amouri v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203909\"><a href=\"/opinion/203909/amouri-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v.

The Yellins have not identified any evidence which, had they been joined earlier, they could have introduced; nor have they made any other showing of actual prejudice.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This is a complicated, hard-fought case. Both sides are represented by highly proficient counsel, but objective appraisals of the facts are to some extent held hostage to the parties' rancor. The district judge has demonstrated patience and skill in sorting out what really happened and navigating through a legal minefield. We are reluctant to prolong a case that already has lingered for a decade, but there is no other principled course available to us. Perhaps, given the passage of time and the large sums already spent on litigation, the parties have reached a point at which a negotiated resolution of their remaining differences is possible. One can only hope.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel to limit the appellants' proof as to the amount owed on the Notes. Thus, we reverse that ruling. In turn, this holding requires vacation of the judgment. The district court will have to determine the actual amount due on the Notes at the relevant time and rework the accounting. We take no view as to the amount due on the Notes; although the appellants assert that the amount due is $7,494,435, Perry and CHI fiercely dispute the basis for that figure.</p>\n<p>The other rulings appealed from are affirmed, and further proceedings in the district court shall be conducted consistent with this opinion. On remand, the district court may take such further evidence as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated, and remanded.</i> All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix</i></h2>\n<p>The district court entered a judgment in favor of Perry in the amount of $4,347,126.

We need not comment upon the correctness of this approach as Perry has offered nothing more than speculation to suggest that the bankruptcy court was motivated by the amount due on the Notes, rather than their uncollectible status. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 473-74 (noting that the accepted representation \"was <i>essential</i> to the bankruptcy judge's approval of the parties' compromise\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 21 was amended in 2007, but the changes were merely stylistic. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 21 advisory committee's note. Consequently, we refer here to the rule as it stood at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p>[6]  This is not a situation in which, as in <i>Eakins,</i> 710 F.2d at 187, a late-joined party and a timely-joined party shared the same counsel but had interests that were not \"sufficiently identical.\" In this instance, the identity of interests is palpable.</p>\n<p>[7]  In all events, any possible prejudice can be avoided here. If the Yellins have any evidence that bears on the accounting, the present posture of this case affords the district court the flexibility, when the case is returned to it, to reopen the case and provide the Yellins with an opportunity to supplement the record.</p>\n\n</div>",
