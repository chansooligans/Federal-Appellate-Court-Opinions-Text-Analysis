Defendant-appellant Tyrone\n                                   \n\nSmith was  indicted in the  United States District Court  for the\n\nDistrict  of Massachusetts for  unlawful reentry into  the United\n\nStates  following deportation, in  violation of 8  U.S.C.   1326.\n\nSmith moved to dismiss the indictment, collaterally attacking the\n\ndeportation  order  upon which  the  indictment was  based.   The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.  Smith then entered into a plea\n\nagreement  in  which he  pleaded  guilty  to the  indictment  but\n\nreserved the  right to appeal  from the denial  of the motion  to\n\ndismiss the indictment.   Smith now appeals this  denial, as well\n\nas  the district  court's denial  of  his motion  for a  downward\n\ndeparture from  the applicable  sentencing guideline  range.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                            I.  FACTS\n\n          A.  The Underlying Deportation\n\n          Smith, a citizen of Jamaica, lived in the United States\n\nas a  lawful permanent  resident.  In  March of  1989, Smith  was\n\nconvicted for unlawful possession of a firearm and trafficking in\n\ncocaine.   The  Immigration and  Naturalization  Service  (\"INS\")\n\nsubsequently commenced  deportation proceedings against  Smith by\n\nissuing an order to show cause.  On September 11, 1991, Smith was\n\narrested and served with the order to show cause.\n\n          On  September  20,  1991,  Smith  appeared  before  the\n\nimmigration court and informed the immigration  judge that he was\n\nrepresented by Paul Carrigan, a Boston attorney.  The immigration\n\njudge informed Smith that he  should appear with his attorney for\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\na deportation hearing on September 27, 1991.  The judge also told\n\nSmith  that there would be a bond hearing on the same day.  Smith\n\ncontends that he did not  know that the deportation hearing would\n\ntake place on September 27,  1991; rather, he thought there would\n\nonly be a bond hearing on that date.\n\n          Smith  appeared  at  the  September  27,  1991 hearing.\n\nAttorney  Carrigan did  not  appear.    Another  attorney,  Manny\n\nDaskal, however,  did appear  on behalf of  Smith, but  only with\n\nrespect to  the bond aspects  of the hearing.   At this  hearing,\n\nwhen  the immigration  judge asked  Smith  if he  had counsel  to\n\nrepresent him for the deportation hearing, Smith replied  that he\n\ndid not.  The immigration judge then  told Smith that he had been\n\ngiven ample time to obtain counsel,  and that the judge was going\n\nforward  with  the deportation  hearing  with Smith  representing\n\nhimself.\n\n          The  deportation   hearing  then  commenced,   and  the\n\nimmigration judge explained the procedure that would be followed.\n\nAfter the  evidence had  been introduced,  the immigration  judge\n\ntold Smith that  based on the types  of offenses of which  he had\n\nbeen  convicted,  a waiver  was  not  available  to Smith.    The\n\nimmigration judge then issued an oral order of deportation.\n\n          The immigration  judge then  announced that notices  of\n\nappeal had  to be  filed by  October 7, 1991,  and explained  the\n\nappeal process  to Smith.   On  October 9,  1991, Smith  filed an\n\nappeal with  the  Board of  Immigration  Appeals in  which  Smith\n\nclaimed that the  immigration judge erred by  failing to consider\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nthe fact that he had five children living in Boston, and that his\n\nwife  was mentally  ill.  Smith  did not  claim that he  had been\n\ndenied  his right  to counsel  at  the deportation  hearing.   On\n\nNovember 14,  1991, before any  action was taken with  respect to\n\nSmith's  appeal,  Attorney  Carrigan sent  a  letter  to  the INS\n\nstating, in pertinent part:  \"I am an attorney for Tyrone  Smith.\n\nI hereby withdraw  any pending appeals he may  have regarding the\n\nabove  referenced   deportation  matter.\"    Smith  himself  also\n\nsubmitted a handwritten statement withdrawing his appeal.\n\n          B.  The Deportation\n\n          Smith was  deported on November  20, 1991.  As  part of\n\nthe deportation process, the INS gave Smith a notice, INS FORM I-\n\n294, which  stated that in the event that  he wished to return to\n\nthe  United States,  he had  to obtain  permission and  that \"any\n\ndeported  person who within five years returns without permission\n\nis  guilty of  a felony.    If convicted  he may  be  punished by\n\nimprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more\n\nthan  $1000.00.\"    Smith signed  the  notice,  acknowledging his\n\nreceipt of  the  document.   INS Form  I-294 only  set forth  the\n\npenalties generally applicable to a violation of 8 U.S.C.   1326,\n\nbut  did not  state the  more  severe penalties  that applied  to\n\naliens, who,  like  Smith, had  been convicted  of an  aggravated\n\nfelony.  In  fact, the penalty Smith would face if he returned to\n\nthe United States without  permission was imprisonment for  up to\n\nfifteen years.\n\n          C.  The Subsequent Criminal Prosecution\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n          Despite the  deportation order,  Smith returned to  the\n\nUnited States, and was subsequently apprehended.  On November 12,\n\n1992, the grand  jury returned a single count indictment charging\n\nSmith  with  illegally  returning  to  the  United  States  after\n\ndeportation and  having been convicted of an aggravated felony in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C.   1326(a) and (b)(2).  On January 19, 1993,\n\nSmith  moved  to  dismiss the  indictment,  maintaining  that the\n\ndeportation   proceeding    underlying   his    deportation   was\n\nfundamentally unfair  and that  he was  functionally deprived  of\n\njudicial  review and  due  process.   On  January  21, 1993,  the\n\ndistrict court held  a hearing with respect to  Smith's motion to\n\ndismiss, and  then denied the motion.  On February 1, 1993, Smith\n\nentered a conditional plea of  guilty, and preserved his right to\n\nseek  review  of  the  denial   of  his  motion  to  dismiss  the\n\nindictment.\n\n          At the sentencing hearing on April 8, 1993, Smith moved\n\nfor  a downward departure  from the applicable  sentencing range.\n\nSmith   argued  that  the  government  engaged  in  actions  that\n\nmitigated  his conduct when  the INS gave  him Form  I-294 at the\n\ntime of his deportation, which incorrectly stated the  penalty he\n\nwould  face if  he returned  to the  United States.   Smith  also\n\nsubmitted an affidavit stating that  he relied on Form I-294 when\n\nhe decided  to return to the  United States.   The district court\n\ndenied Smith's motion  for a downward departure,  indicating that\n\nit  would be  antithetical to  the  policy behind  the Sentencing\n\nReform Act, which  is to deter people from  committing crimes, to\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\ngrant  his  motion, given  that  the  facts indicated  Smith  had\n\nknowingly committed a felony.  The district court  then sentenced\n\nSmith to 70 months in prison.\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\n            II.  THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT\n\n          Smith claims that he was denied his right to counsel at\n\nthe  September 27, 1991 deportation hearing.  Specifically, Smith\n\nclaims  that the  immigration  judge  erred  at  his  deportation\n\nhearing either by compelling  him to go forward unrepresented  or\n\nby not explicitly asking him whether  he wanted representation at\n\nthe  deportation hearing.    Therefore,  Smith  seeks  to  attack\n\ncollaterally the original  order of deportation, arguing  that it\n\ncannot properly  serve as  the basis for  his indictment  under 8\n\nU.S.C.   1326.1\n\n          To  provide a  basis  to  attack  a  deportation  order\n\ncollaterally  in a subsequent  criminal prosecution,  a defendant\n\nmust  show  that  any  error   committed  with  respect  to   the\n\n                    \n\n1  8 U.S.C.   1326 (Supp. 1993) provides in pertinent part:\n\n          (a)  Subject   to  subsection  (b)   of  this\n          section, any alien who --\n\n            (1)  has been  arrested  and deported  or\n            excluded and deported, and thereafter\n            (2) enters, attempts to  enter, or is  at\n            any  time found  in,  the United  States,\n            . . . \n\n          shall be fined under  Title 18, or imprisoned\n          not more than 2 years, or both.\n\n          (b)   Notwithstanding subsection (a)  of this\n          section,  in the case  of any alien described\n          in such subsection --\n                              . . .\n\n            (2) whose deportation was subsequent to a\n            conviction   for    commission   of    an\n            aggravated  felony, such  alien shall  be\n            fined  under such  Title, imprisoned  not\n            more than 15 years, or both.\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\ndeportation hearing  violated his  due process  rights, and  that\n\nthis   error  was   \"'so   fundamental'   that  it   'effectively\n\n[eliminated] the right  of the alien to obtain judicial review'\".\n\nUnited States v. Vieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                                  \n\n(quoting United States v.  Mendoza-L pez, 481 U.S. 828, 837-39  &amp;\n                                        \n\nn.17   (1987)).      \"'[W]here  a   determination   made   in  an\n\nadministrative proceeding  is  to play  a  critical role  in  the\n\nsubsequent imposition of a criminal  sanction, there must be some\n                                                                 \n\nmeaningful review  of the  administrative proceeding.'\"   Vieira-\n                                                                 \n\nCandelario, 6 F.3d at 15 (quoting Mendoza-L pez, 481 U.S. at 837-\n                                               \n\n38).\n\n          The  First  Circuit  has  recently  considered  a  case\n\nanalogous to the present situation, and its  holding controls our\n\ndecision here.    In  Vieira-Candelario,  the  immigration  judge\n                                       \n\napparently erred in  ruling that the  defendant was not  eligible\n\nfor  a  waiver  pursuant  to    212(c)  of  the  Immigration  and\n\nNaturalization Act,  8 U.S.C.    1182(c).   6  F.3d at  15.   The\n\nimmigration  judge advised the  defendant regarding his  right to\n\nappeal.   Id. at 13.    The day after the  hearing, the defendant\n            \n\ndid, in fact,  file a notice of appeal in which he challenged the\n\nimmigration judge's  ruling.  Id.   The issue was  never reached,\n                                \n\nhowever,  because the  defendant  withdrew  his  appeal  and  was\n\ndeported shortly  after doing so.   Id.  INS  agents subsequently\n                                      \n\nfound Vieira in  Providence, Rhode Island,  and charged him  with\n\nviolating  8 U.S.C.    1326.    Id.   Vieira moved  to  quash the\n                                  \n\nindictment   and  to  dismiss   the  indictment  by  collaterally\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nattacking  the deportation  order,  arguing  that  it  could  not\n\nproperly serve as  the basis for his indictment under  8 U.S.C.  \n\n1326.  Id.  In rejecting the defendant's collateral attack on the\n         \n\ndeportation order, this Court observed:\n\n            Here,  in contrast  to  the situation  in\n            Mendoza-L pez,  the  immigration  judge's\n                         \n            putatively  erroneous  decision  did  not\n            \"effectively\" rob Vieira of his right  to\n            review.  Vieira filed a notice of appeal.\n            He   later   deliberately   withdrew  the\n            appeal.   He was  represented by  counsel\n            throughout.      As   Vieira  voluntarily\n            abandoned his right  to obtain review  of\n            the deportation  order, we see  no way to\n            hold that  he was deprived  of meaningful\n            review of  the administrative  proceeding\n            contrary to the due process clause.\n\nId. at 15.\n  \n\n          Smith  claims that the  immigration judge erred  at the\n\ndeportation hearing by denying him his right to counsel.   At the\n\nconclusion of the deportation  hearing, however, the  immigration\n\njudge  explained the appeal process to Smith, which required that\n\na  notice  of appeal  be  filed  with  the Board  of  Immigration\n\nAppeals.   Smith  then availed  himself of  his right  to appeal,\n\nalbeit  not on the  ground that he  was deprived of  his right to\n\ncounsel.  The  appeal process then ended only  because Smith, and\n\nhis  attorney, Mr. Carrigan, sent letters to the INS deliberately\n\nwithdrawing the appeal.\n\n          While this  case does differ from  Vieira-Candelario in\n                                                              \n\nthat Smith claims that he was deprived of his right to counsel at\n\nthe  deportation hearing, this difference does not alter the fact\n\nthat  Smith  was afforded  the  opportunity  to appeal  from  the\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nimmigration  judge's decision.    The fact  that  Smith filed  an\n\nappeal  demonstrates that  he  understood  his appellate  rights.\n\nMoreover,  Smith consulted with his attorney regarding the appeal\n\nprocess, as evidenced by the fact that Attorney Carrigan, as well\n\nas Smith, sent a  letter to the INS withdrawing the  appeal which\n\nSmith did file.  Additionally, while Smith did not appeal on  the\n\nground  that he had been deprived of  counsel, he could have done\n\nso.    Because  nothing  that  happened  in  Smith's  deportation\n\nproceeding  affected his ability to appeal, his collateral attack\n\non the deportation hearing must fail.\n\n                         III.  SENTENCING\n\n          Smith challenges the district court's refusal  to grant\n\nhim a downward  departure from the sentencing range  set forth in\n\nthe Sentencing  Guidelines.  Smith  argues that by virtue  of the\n\nform the INS gave him at the time of his deportation, INS Form I-\n\n294,  the government erroneously informed him of the consequences\n\nof returning unlawfully to the country.  The INS told Smith  that\n\nthe  maximum penalty  he would face  was two  years imprisonment,\n\ninstead of the correct penalty  of 15 years.  Smith submitted  an\n\naffidavit stating that  he relied upon this form  when he decided\n\nto return to  the United  States, and  that had he  known of  the\n\nhigher  penalty he would face, he  would not have returned to the\n\nUnited States.  Therefore, Smith contends that this constituted a\n\nmitigating circumstance  that the  Sentencing Commission  had not\n\ntaken  into account  when it  formulated  the guidelines,  and it\n\nwarranted a downward  departure.  Smith argues  that the district\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\ncourt improperly denied  his motion by concluding  that it lacked\n\nthe legal  authority to consider  the INS  notice as a  basis for\n\ndeparture under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n          The   government  argues   that   the  district   court\n\nunderstood  that it  had the  power to  consider whether  the INS\n\nnotice  provided a  ground  for  departure  from  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.   But, the  government contends,  the district  court\n\nsimply refused to exercise its discretion to depart downward.\n\n          Ordinarily, a district court's  refusal to exercise its\n\ndiscretion  and depart downward from the sentencing guidelines is\n\nnot appealable.  United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d  568, 571 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1993);  United  States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41,  42 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991).

Sec. 1326.  Smith moved to dismiss the indictment, collaterally attacking the deportation order upon which the indictment was based.  The district court denied the motion.  Smith then entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to the indictment but reserved the right to appeal from the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment.  Smith now appeals this denial, as well as the district court's denial of his motion for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Underlying Deportation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith, a citizen of Jamaica, lived in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.  In March of 1989, Smith was convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm and trafficking in cocaine.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") subsequently commenced deportation proceedings against Smith by issuing an order to show cause.  On September 11, 1991, Smith was arrested and served with the order to show cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 1991, Smith appeared before the immigration court and informed the immigration judge that he was represented by Paul Carrigan, a Boston attorney.  The immigration judge informed Smith that he should appear with his attorney for a deportation hearing on September 27, 1991.  The judge also told Smith that there would be a bond hearing on the same day.  Smith contends that he did not know that the deportation hearing would take place on September 27, 1991;  rather, he thought there would only be a bond hearing on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith appeared at the September 27, 1991 hearing.  Attorney Carrigan did not appear.  Another attorney, Manny Daskal, however, did appear on behalf of Smith, but only with respect to the bond aspects of the hearing.  At this hearing, when the immigration judge asked Smith if he had counsel to represent him for the deportation hearing, Smith replied that he did not.  The immigration judge then told Smith that he had been given ample time to obtain counsel, and that the judge was going forward with the deportation hearing with Smith representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deportation hearing then commenced, and the immigration judge explained the procedure that would be followed.  After the evidence had been introduced, the immigration judge told Smith that based on the types of offenses of which he had been convicted, a waiver was not available to Smith.  The immigration judge then issued an oral order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge then announced that notices of appeal had to be filed by October 7, 1991, and explained the appeal process to Smith.  On October 9, 1991, Smith filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals in which Smith claimed that the immigration judge erred by failing to consider the fact that he had five children living in Boston, and that his wife was mentally ill.  Smith did not claim that he had been denied his right to counsel at the deportation hearing.  On November 14, 1991, before any action was taken with respect to Smith's appeal, Attorney Carrigan sent a letter to the INS stating, in pertinent part:  \"I am an attorney for Tyrone Smith.  I hereby withdraw any pending appeals he may have regarding the above referenced deportation matter.\"   Smith himself also submitted a handwritten statement withdrawing his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Deportation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith was deported on November 20, 1991.  As part of the deportation process, the INS gave Smith a notice, INS FORM I-294, which stated that in the event that he wished to return to the United States, he had to obtain permission and that \"any deported person who within five years returns without permission is guilty of a felony.  If convicted he may be punished by imprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more than $1000.00.\"   Smith signed the notice, acknowledging his receipt of the document.  INS Form I-294 only set forth the penalties generally applicable to a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, but did not state the more severe penalties that applied to aliens, who, like Smith, had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  In fact, the penalty Smith would face if he returned to the United States without permission was imprisonment for up to fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Subsequent Criminal Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the deportation order, Smith returned to the United States, and was subsequently apprehended.  On November 12, 1992, the grand jury returned a single count indictment charging Smith with illegally returning to the United States after deportation and having been convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a) and (b)(2).  On January 19, 1993, Smith moved to dismiss the indictment, maintaining that the deportation proceeding underlying his deportation was fundamentally unfair and that he was functionally deprived of judicial review and due process.  On January 21, 1993, the district court held a hearing with respect to Smith's motion to dismiss, and then denied the motion.  On February 1, 1993, Smith entered a conditional plea of guilty, and preserved his right to seek review of the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on April 8, 1993, Smith moved for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing range.  Smith argued that the government engaged in actions that mitigated his conduct when the INS gave him Form I-294 at the time of his deportation, which incorrectly stated the penalty he would face if he returned to the United States.  Smith also submitted an affidavit stating that he relied on Form I-294 when he decided to return to the United States.  The district court denied Smith's motion for a downward departure, indicating that it would be antithetical to the policy behind the Sentencing Reform Act, which is to deter people from committing crimes, to grant his motion, given that the facts indicated Smith had knowingly committed a felony.  The district court then sentenced Smith to 70 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that he was denied his right to counsel at the September 27, 1991 deportation hearing.  Specifically, Smith claims that the immigration judge erred at his deportation hearing either by compelling him to go forward unrepresented or by not explicitly asking him whether he wanted representation at the deportation hearing.  Therefore, Smith seeks to attack collaterally the original order of deportation, arguing that it cannot properly serve as the basis for his indictment under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide a basis to attack a deportation order collaterally in a subsequent criminal prosecution, a defendant must show that any error committed with respect to the deportation hearing violated his due process rights, and that this error was \" 'so fundamental' that it 'effectively [eliminated] the right of the alien to obtain judicial review' \".  United States v. Vieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Mendoza- Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 837-39 &amp; n. 17, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 2155-56 &amp; n. 17, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987)).  \" '[W]here a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction, there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.' \"  Vieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d at 15 (quoting Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. at 837-38, 107 S.Ct. at 2155).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Circuit has recently considered a case analogous to the present situation, and its holding controls our decision here.  In Vieira-Candelario, the immigration judge apparently erred in ruling that the defendant was not eligible for a waiver pursuant to Sec. 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).  6 F.3d at 15.   The immigration judge advised the defendant regarding his right to appeal.  Id. at 13.   The day after the hearing, the defendant did, in fact, file a notice of appeal in which he challenged the immigration judge's ruling.  Id. The issue was never reached, however, because the defendant withdrew his appeal and was deported shortly after doing so.  Id.  INS agents subsequently found Vieira in Providence, Rhode Island, and charged him with violating 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  Id.  Vieira moved to quash the indictment and to dismiss the indictment by collaterally attacking the deportation order, arguing that it could not properly serve as the basis for his indictment under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  Id.  In rejecting the defendant's collateral attack on the deportation order, this Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Here, in contrast to the situation in Mendoza-Lopez, the immigration judge's putatively erroneous decision did not \"effectively\" rob Vieira of his right to review.  Vieira filed a notice of appeal.  He later deliberately withdrew the appeal.  He was represented by counsel throughout.  As Vieira voluntarily abandoned his right to obtain review of the deportation order, we see no way to hold that he was deprived of meaningful review of the administrative proceeding contrary to the due process clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that the immigration judge erred at the deportation hearing by denying him his right to counsel.  At the conclusion of the deportation hearing, however, the immigration judge explained the appeal process to Smith, which required that a notice of appeal be filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals.  Smith then availed himself of his right to appeal, albeit not on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel.  The appeal process then ended only because Smith, and his attorney, Mr. Carrigan, sent letters to the INS deliberately withdrawing the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case does differ from Vieira-Candelario in that Smith claims that he was deprived of his right to counsel at the deportation hearing, this difference does not alter the fact that Smith was afforded the opportunity to appeal from the immigration judge's decision.  The fact that Smith filed an appeal demonstrates that he understood his appellate rights.  Moreover, Smith consulted with his attorney regarding the appeal process, as evidenced by the fact that Attorney Carrigan, as well as Smith, sent a letter to the INS withdrawing the appeal which Smith did file.  Additionally, while Smith did not appeal on the ground that he had been deprived of counsel, he could have done so.  Because nothing that happened in Smith's deportation proceeding affected his ability to appeal, his collateral attack on the deportation hearing must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith challenges the district court's refusal to grant him a downward departure from the sentencing range set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines.  Smith argues that by virtue of the form the INS gave him at the time of his deportation, INS Form I-294, the government erroneously informed him of the consequences of returning unlawfully to the country.  The INS told Smith that the maximum penalty he would face was two years imprisonment, instead of the correct penalty of 15 years.  Smith submitted an affidavit stating that he relied upon this form when he decided to return to the United States, and that had he known of the higher penalty he would face, he would not have returned to the United States.  Therefore, Smith contends that this constituted a mitigating circumstance that the Sentencing Commission had not taken into account when it formulated the guidelines, and it warranted a downward departure.  Smith argues that the district court improperly denied his motion by concluding that it lacked the legal authority to consider the INS notice as a basis for departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court understood that it had the power to consider whether the INS notice provided a ground for departure from the Sentencing Guidelines.  But, the government contends, the district court simply refused to exercise its discretion to depart downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a district court's refusal to exercise its discretion and depart downward from the sentencing guidelines is not appealable.  United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 571 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1991).  Appellate jurisdiction may attach, however, where the district court's decision not to depart is based on the court's view that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure.  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22-23 (1st Cir.1991).  The record can be fairly read to support the conclusion that the district court believed that it lacked the legal authority to depart under the Guidelines on the basis of the INS notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Thus, we review the district court's decision to determine whether or not, it did, in fact, possess the power to depart downward based on this circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plenary review is appropriate where the question is \"whether or not the allegedly special circumstances (i.e., the reasons for departure) are of the 'kind' that the Guidelines, in principle, permit the sentencing court to consider at all.\"  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 951 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Reform Act, a court may depart downward if it finds that there was a mitigating circumstance \"of a kind\" which the Sentencing Commission did not \"adequately take[ ] into consideration ... in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0, p.s.;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 946-47.   If the court finds that the sentencing commission did not adequately take a circumstance into consideration, it must then determine if the circumstance is of a kind which should justify a departure.  To make this determination, a court should look to the sentencing system's purposes and the guidelines themselves.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947, 949.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553 specifies the purposes which the sentencing system is attempting to achieve, and provides that in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, a court should consider, among other factors, the need for the sentence imposed \"to promote respect for the law,\" and \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that when the Sentencing Commission formulated its guidelines, it considered an unusual situation like the present one.  Despite this lack of prior consideration, however, this situation does not present the kind of circumstance a sentencing court should consider to support a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith contends that because he relied on an INS notice that misstated the criminal penalty he would face if he illegally returned to the United States, he should be granted a downward departure.  Smith's contention runs counter to a primary purpose of the sentencing system, which is to deter criminal conduct.  The Sentencing Guidelines were established, in part, to create penalties which were high enough to discourage people from committing a particular crime.  Smith implicitly admits that he intentionally committed a felony.  The sentencing court cannot countenance Smith's purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct, and grant him the benefit of a downward departure, because Smith understood the penalty he would face to be relatively minor.  Rather, the sentencing court was required to sentence Smith within the applicable sentencing range, so that Smith and others would be deterred from illegally reentering the country in the future.  Therefore, the district court's finding that this was not the kind of circumstance that should justify a downward departure was proper, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 8 U.S.C.

Smith now appeals this denial, as well as the district court's denial of his motion for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Underlying Deportation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith, a citizen of Jamaica, lived in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.  In March of 1989, Smith was convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm and trafficking in cocaine.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") subsequently commenced deportation proceedings against Smith by issuing an order to show cause.  On September 11, 1991, Smith was arrested and served with the order to show cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 1991, Smith appeared before the immigration court and informed the immigration judge that he was represented by Paul Carrigan, a Boston attorney.  The immigration judge informed Smith that he should appear with his attorney for a deportation hearing on September 27, 1991.  The judge also told Smith that there would be a bond hearing on the same day.  Smith contends that he did not know that the deportation hearing would take place on September 27, 1991;  rather, he thought there would only be a bond hearing on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith appeared at the September 27, 1991 hearing.  Attorney Carrigan did not appear.  Another attorney, Manny Daskal, however, did appear on behalf of Smith, but only with respect to the bond aspects of the hearing.  At this hearing, when the immigration judge asked Smith if he had counsel to represent him for the deportation hearing, Smith replied that he did not.  The immigration judge then told Smith that he had been given ample time to obtain counsel, and that the judge was going forward with the deportation hearing with Smith representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deportation hearing then commenced, and the immigration judge explained the procedure that would be followed.  After the evidence had been introduced, the immigration judge told Smith that based on the types of offenses of which he had been convicted, a waiver was not available to Smith.  The immigration judge then issued an oral order of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immigration judge then announced that notices of appeal had to be filed by October 7, 1991, and explained the appeal process to Smith.  On October 9, 1991, Smith filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals in which Smith claimed that the immigration judge erred by failing to consider the fact that he had five children living in Boston, and that his wife was mentally ill.  Smith did not claim that he had been denied his right to counsel at the deportation hearing.  On November 14, 1991, before any action was taken with respect to Smith's appeal, Attorney Carrigan sent a letter to the INS stating, in pertinent part:  \"I am an attorney for Tyrone Smith.  I hereby withdraw any pending appeals he may have regarding the above referenced deportation matter.\"   Smith himself also submitted a handwritten statement withdrawing his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Deportation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith was deported on November 20, 1991.  As part of the deportation process, the INS gave Smith a notice, INS FORM I-294, which stated that in the event that he wished to return to the United States, he had to obtain permission and that \"any deported person who within five years returns without permission is guilty of a felony.  If convicted he may be punished by imprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more than $1000.00.\"   Smith signed the notice, acknowledging his receipt of the document.  INS Form I-294 only set forth the penalties generally applicable to a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, but did not state the more severe penalties that applied to aliens, who, like Smith, had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  In fact, the penalty Smith would face if he returned to the United States without permission was imprisonment for up to fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Subsequent Criminal Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the deportation order, Smith returned to the United States, and was subsequently apprehended.  On November 12, 1992, the grand jury returned a single count indictment charging Smith with illegally returning to the United States after deportation and having been convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326(a) and (b)(2).  On January 19, 1993, Smith moved to dismiss the indictment, maintaining that the deportation proceeding underlying his deportation was fundamentally unfair and that he was functionally deprived of judicial review and due process.  On January 21, 1993, the district court held a hearing with respect to Smith's motion to dismiss, and then denied the motion.  On February 1, 1993, Smith entered a conditional plea of guilty, and preserved his right to seek review of the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on April 8, 1993, Smith moved for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing range.  Smith argued that the government engaged in actions that mitigated his conduct when the INS gave him Form I-294 at the time of his deportation, which incorrectly stated the penalty he would face if he returned to the United States.  Smith also submitted an affidavit stating that he relied on Form I-294 when he decided to return to the United States.  The district court denied Smith's motion for a downward departure, indicating that it would be antithetical to the policy behind the Sentencing Reform Act, which is to deter people from committing crimes, to grant his motion, given that the facts indicated Smith had knowingly committed a felony.  The district court then sentenced Smith to 70 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that he was denied his right to counsel at the September 27, 1991 deportation hearing.  Specifically, Smith claims that the immigration judge erred at his deportation hearing either by compelling him to go forward unrepresented or by not explicitly asking him whether he wanted representation at the deportation hearing.  Therefore, Smith seeks to attack collaterally the original order of deportation, arguing that it cannot properly serve as the basis for his indictment under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide a basis to attack a deportation order collaterally in a subsequent criminal prosecution, a defendant must show that any error committed with respect to the deportation hearing violated his due process rights, and that this error was \" 'so fundamental' that it 'effectively [eliminated] the right of the alien to obtain judicial review' \".  United States v. Vieira-Candelario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194965\"><a href=\"/opinion/194965/united-states-v-vieira-candelario/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Mendoza- Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span>, 837-39 &amp; n. 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span> (1987)).  \" '[W]here a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction, there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.' \"  Vieira-Candelario, 6 F.3d at 15 (quoting Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. at 837-38, 107 S.Ct. at 2155).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Circuit has recently considered a case analogous to the present situation, and its holding controls our decision here.  In Vieira-Candelario, the immigration judge apparently erred in ruling that the defendant was not eligible for a waiver pursuant to Sec. 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).  6 F.3d at 15.   The immigration judge advised the defendant regarding his right to appeal.  Id. at 13.   The day after the hearing, the defendant did, in fact, file a notice of appeal in which he challenged the immigration judge's ruling.  Id. The issue was never reached, however, because the defendant withdrew his appeal and was deported shortly after doing so.  Id.  INS agents subsequently found Vieira in Providence, Rhode Island, and charged him with violating 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  Id.  Vieira moved to quash the indictment and to dismiss the indictment by collaterally attacking the deportation order, arguing that it could not properly serve as the basis for his indictment under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.  Id.  In rejecting the defendant's collateral attack on the deportation order, this Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Here, in contrast to the situation in Mendoza-Lopez, the immigration judge's putatively erroneous decision did not \"effectively\" rob Vieira of his right to review.  Vieira filed a notice of appeal.  He later deliberately withdrew the appeal.  He was represented by counsel throughout.  As Vieira voluntarily abandoned his right to obtain review of the deportation order, we see no way to hold that he was deprived of meaningful review of the administrative proceeding contrary to the due process clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that the immigration judge erred at the deportation hearing by denying him his right to counsel.  At the conclusion of the deportation hearing, however, the immigration judge explained the appeal process to Smith, which required that a notice of appeal be filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals.  Smith then availed himself of his right to appeal, albeit not on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel.  The appeal process then ended only because Smith, and his attorney, Mr. Carrigan, sent letters to the INS deliberately withdrawing the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case does differ from Vieira-Candelario in that Smith claims that he was deprived of his right to counsel at the deportation hearing, this difference does not alter the fact that Smith was afforded the opportunity to appeal from the immigration judge's decision.  The fact that Smith filed an appeal demonstrates that he understood his appellate rights.  Moreover, Smith consulted with his attorney regarding the appeal process, as evidenced by the fact that Attorney Carrigan, as well as Smith, sent a letter to the INS withdrawing the appeal which Smith did file.  Additionally, while Smith did not appeal on the ground that he had been deprived of counsel, he could have done so.  Because nothing that happened in Smith's deportation proceeding affected his ability to appeal, his collateral attack on the deportation hearing must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith challenges the district court's refusal to grant him a downward departure from the sentencing range set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines.  Smith argues that by virtue of the form the INS gave him at the time of his deportation, INS Form I-294, the government erroneously informed him of the consequences of returning unlawfully to the country.  The INS told Smith that the maximum penalty he would face was two years imprisonment, instead of the correct penalty of 15 years.  Smith submitted an affidavit stating that he relied upon this form when he decided to return to the United States, and that had he known of the higher penalty he would face, he would not have returned to the United States.  Therefore, Smith contends that this constituted a mitigating circumstance that the Sentencing Commission had not taken into account when it formulated the guidelines, and it warranted a downward departure.  Smith argues that the district court improperly denied his motion by concluding that it lacked the legal authority to consider the INS notice as a basis for departure under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court understood that it had the power to consider whether the INS notice provided a ground for departure from the Sentencing Guidelines.  But, the government contends, the district court simply refused to exercise its discretion to depart downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a district court's refusal to exercise its discretion and depart downward from the sentencing guidelines is not appealable.  United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Rushby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1991).  Appellate jurisdiction may attach, however, where the district court's decision not to depart is based on the court's view that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure.  United States v. Romolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22-23 (1st Cir.1991).  The record can be fairly read to support the conclusion that the district court believed that it lacked the legal authority to depart under the Guidelines on the basis of the INS notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Thus, we review the district court's decision to determine whether or not, it did, in fact, possess the power to depart downward based on this circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plenary review is appropriate where the question is \"whether or not the allegedly special circumstances (i.e., the reasons for departure) are of the 'kind' that the Guidelines, in principle, permit the sentencing court to consider at all.\"  United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 951 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Reform Act, a court may depart downward if it finds that there was a mitigating circumstance \"of a kind\" which the Sentencing Commission did not \"adequately take[ ] into consideration ... in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0, p.s.;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 946-47.   If the court finds that the sentencing commission did not adequately take a circumstance into consideration, it must then determine if the circumstance is of a kind which should justify a departure.  To make this determination, a court should look to the sentencing system's purposes and the guidelines themselves.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947, 949.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553 specifies the purposes which the sentencing system is attempting to achieve, and provides that in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, a court should consider, among other factors, the need for the sentence imposed \"to promote respect for the law,\" and \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that when the Sentencing Commission formulated its guidelines, it considered an unusual situation like the present one.  Despite this lack of prior consideration, however, this situation does not present the kind of circumstance a sentencing court should consider to support a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith contends that because he relied on an INS notice that misstated the criminal penalty he would face if he illegally returned to the United States, he should be granted a downward departure.  Smith's contention runs counter to a primary purpose of the sentencing system, which is to deter criminal conduct.  The Sentencing Guidelines were established, in part, to create penalties which were high enough to discourage people from committing a particular crime.  Smith implicitly admits that he intentionally committed a felony.  The sentencing court cannot countenance Smith's purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct, and grant him the benefit of a downward departure, because Smith understood the penalty he would face to be relatively minor.  Rather, the sentencing court was required to sentence Smith within the applicable sentencing range, so that Smith and others would be deterred from illegally reentering the country in the future.  Therefore, the district court's finding that this was not the kind of circumstance that should justify a downward departure was proper, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 8 U.S.C.
