The grand jury indicted a number\n                          \n\nof  persons  for conspiring  to  distribute  cocaine and  for\n\nrelated offenses.  Several of  those indicted pled guilty but\n\nthree were  tried jointly and convicted.    The appeal of one\n\nof those convicted  is decided today in  a separate decision.\n\nUnited  States v.

In  this decision, we\n                       \n\naddress  the appeals  of the  other two  defendants  who were\n\nconvicted  at  trial, together  with  the  appeal of  another\n\ndefendant who pleaded guilty  but contests his sentence.   In\n\ntwo of the three cases we  affirm; and in one we remand  on a\n\nsingle issue for resentencing.\n\n                              I.\n\n     We begin with a  brief outline of the facts  and history\n\nof the  case, reserving additional detail  for our discussion\n\nof individual claims of error.  The evidence submitted to the\n\njury is, of  course, to be viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto  the verdict, the  jury being  accorded great  latitude in\n\nresolving  credibility  and  drawing  reasonable  inferences.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1078-79 (1st\n                                \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910 (1989).  \n                   \n\n     On August  9, 1990,  the grand  jury indicted  the three\n\nappellants now in this  court (Richard Moretto, David Elwell,\n\nand  Hobart  Willis),  as  well as  six  other  persons,  for\n\nconspiracy  to distribute cocaine.   21 U.S.C.    846.  Other\n\ncountsin the indictment chargedvarious of the defendants with\n\n                             -5-\n\nrelated  crimes.   Willis  and  several  others pled  guilty,\n\nWillis pleading to conspiracy and five counts of distribution\n\nunder  21 U.S.C.     841.   After  trial the  jury  convicted\n\nMoretto,  Elwell, and  George  Moran (whose  appeal has  been\n\nseparately decided) of conspiracy.   In addition, Moretto was\n\nfound  guilty of witness intimidation, 18  U.S.C.   1512, and\n\nElwell  of three counts of distribution, 21 U.S.C.   841, and\n\none of filing a false tax return.  26 U.S.C.   7206.\n\n     The critical testimony at  trial, except in the case  of\n\nMoran,  came primarily  from Mark  Polito, whose  account was\n\nbolstered  by  police  testimony  and tape  recordings.    He\n\ntestified that during  the spring of 1988  he purchased ounce\n\nquantities  of  cocaine  every  week  or  two  from  Moretto.\n\nBecause Moretto was scheduled to report to prison for a prior\n\noffense, Moretto--according to Polito's testimony--arranged a\n\nmeeting between Polito  and Willis, \"the man he [Moretto] got\n\nhis stuff from.\"   At the meeting Willis agreed  to introduce\n\nPolito to  the  distributor  who  managed  Willis'  \"northern\n\nterritory.\"  A  few days  later Willis  introduced Polito  to\n\nElwell and  for the  next few months  Elwell supplied  Polito\n\nwith cocaine at the same price previously charged by Moretto.\n\n     Polito  eventually  fell behind  in payments  and, under\n\npressure  for payment  exerted by  Willis and  Elwell, Polito\n\nbegan to cooperate secretly with law enforcement authorities.\n\nNow buying  drugs  with  government  money,  Polito  recorded\n\n                             -6-\n\nconversations with Elwell and, on one occasion, brought a DEA\n\nundercover  agent to a meeting  with Elwell.   During a later\n\nsale,  Elwell  told  Polito  that  Willis  wanted  Polito  to\n\n\"remember\"  Moretto  at  Christmas,  Moretto  then  being  in\n\nprison.   This  reminder  was repeated  at  a later  meeting.\n\nEventually Elwell became suspicious of Polito, ceased to deal\n\nwith  him and in 1989 Willis began to supply Polito directly.\n\nThe last reported transaction  occurred on February 16, 1989,\n\nwhen  Polito  paid Willis  part of  the  money still  owed to\n\nElwell for prior purchases.\n\n     Moretto  was released from prison  on June 5,  1990.  On\n\nJune 11 and 12, 1990,  three telephone calls occurred between\n\nMoretto and  Polito, which  Polito secretly recorded.   Those\n\ncalls, described  below, formed the basis  of the obstruction\n\ncount against Moretto.  Nothing pertinent to the  charges was\n\nproved at trial  to have occurred after  June 12.   In August\n\n1990, the indictment was returned.\n\n     Following Willis'  guilty plea and the  trial of Elwell,\n\nMoretto and Moran,  the defendants were  sentenced.    Willis\n\nand Moretto  were  found to  be  career offenders  under  the\n\nSentencing Guidelines and each was sentenced to 210 months in\n\nprison.   Elwell  was sentenced  to 78  months.   The present\n\nappeals followed.\n\n                             -7-\n\n                             II.\n\n     Moretto's main  argument on appeal is  that the evidence\n\nof his adherence to the  conspiracy charged in the indictment\n\nwas  too weak  to permit a  reasonable jury  to convict.   He\n\nfurther  argues that,  at most,  the evidence  showed several\n\nconspiracies  rather  than  the  single one  charged  in  the\n\nindictment,  and  he  asserts  that  this  supposed  variance\n\nbetween the conspiracy charged  and any conspiracy proved was\n\nprejudicial.    We  need  not treat  the  prejudice  argument\n\nseparately because we conclude that the evidence  adequately,\n\nif  not amply, supported  the government's claim  of a single\n\nconspiracy  involving Willis  and  others  in  which  Moretto\n\nparticipated.\n\n     Moretto does not dispute  that Willis directed a cocaine\n\nring  but,  carving his  own role  into  phases, he  seeks to\n\ndistance himself from  the ring.  Moretto's repeated sales of\n\ncocaine to Polito in the first part of 1988, which were amply\n\nproved, are claimed by  Moretto to fall outside the  ambit of\n\nthe  Willis ring.1   Moretto  then argues  that he  could not\n\n                    \n\n     1Moretto   places  stress  upon   a  statement   of  the\nprosecutor, made to  the judge in a pretrial conference, that\nthe conspiracy charged by the  government began in March 1988\nwhen  Moretto  introduced Polito  to  Willis.   Although  the\nprosecutor did make such a statement--seemingly a slip of the\ntongue--the government's actual theory of  the conspiracy was\nthat it reached  back to embrace Moretto's  earlier sales, as\nthe  prosecutor made fairly clear  at the bottom  of the same\ntranscript page  and even clearer  two pages  later.   There,\nresponding to the judge's question (\"The Government's  theory\nis that there  was some association between them [Moretto and\n\n                             -8-\n\nhave  participated in the ring  from March 1988  to June 1990\n\nsince he  was in prison.  As to the conversations with Polito\n\non June 11-12, 1990, Moretto says that--even assuming them to\n\nbe  obstructive--they  occurred well  after  the last  proved\n\ntransaction of  Willis and Polito  on February 16,  1989, and\n\ntherefore occurred after the conspiracy.  \n\n     The jury was entitled  to link these supposedly separate\n\nevents together with  certain connecting  facts that  Moretto\n\nomits.   The drug  sales he made to  Polito during early l988\n\nwere,  the  jury  could  have concluded,  based  on  supplies\n\nfurnished  by   Willis;   Moretto,  according   to   Polito's\n\ntestimony, said that  Willis was  \"the man he  got his  stuff\n\nfrom.\"    The jury could  also have thought  that the Willis-\n\nMoretto relationship was a continuing one since, when Moretto\n\nwas forced to  report to  prison, he introduced  Willis as  a\n\nsubstitute supplier.  Willis  then arranged for further sales\n\nto Polito at Moretto's  original price.  One act,  after all,\n\ncan take  color from others,  and drawing such  inferences is\n\nthe jury's task.\n\n     During  Moretto's first  year in  prison there  is ample\n\nevidence of continued  sales by Elwell and  Willis to Polito.\n\nMoretto, although  in prison,  was  not entirely  out of  the\n\npicture: Elwell twice  told Polito that Willis  wanted him to\n\n                    \n\nWillis] prior  to that  introduction [of Polito  to Willis]),\nthe  prosecutor stated, \"Yes, from Moretto up the ladder  . .\n. .\" \n\n                             -9-\n\n\"remember\" or not forget Moretto at Christmas.  While various\n\ninferences  can be drawn from these reminders, the jury could\n\nhave believed that they reinforced Moretto's connection  with\n\nthe  ongoing  conspiracy (even  assuming,  as the  government\n\nseems to do  in its brief, that Moretto was not a participant\n\nwhile  imprisoned).2   Specifically,  the evidence  increases\n\nthe  likelihood, however  slightly, that  Moretto was  once a\n\nconspirator and might rejoin the conspiracy after prison.\n\n     The jury could then  have concluded that, in making  the\n\ntelephone calls to  Polito in June  1990, Moretto did  rejoin\n\nthe conspiracy.   It is  true that  the time gap  between the\n\nlast proved Willis ring transaction  in February 1989 and the\n\ncalls in  June 1990  is substantial.   But the  jury was  not\n\nobliged to  believe that  a well  organized drug  ring, which\n\nenjoyed  a  \"northern  territory\"  and  remembered  a  former\n\nassociate at Christmas, had suddenly expired.  When this same\n\nformer foot soldier is discovered in June  1990 threatening a\n\nwitness, who  is believed  likely to  testify  to the  ring's\n\n                    \n\n     2The government's brief in  fact points to evidence that\nMoretto  while  in  prison  telephoned  Polito's  mother   to\nthreaten Polito for failing to pay his drug-purchasing debts.\nThat  evidence may  not have been  admissible because  of its\nhearsay  character--apparently  the  initial  source  of  the\nevidence was Polito's mother, who  did not testify.  However,\nthis  evidence  is not  challenged  on this  appeal,  and the\nremaining evidence  against Moretto is adequate  even if this\nevidence, largely  embodied in a single  sentence of Polito's\ntestimony, is ignored.  \n\n                             -10-\n\nactivities,  the  jury might  well  have  concluded that  the\n\nconspiracy was ongoing and the soldier had just reenlisted.\n\n      Grunewald  v.  United  States,  353  U.S.  391  (1957),\n                                   \n\nheavily relied on by Moretto, does not forbid this inference.\n\nIt  dealt  with  entirely  different  facts--specifically,  a\n\nconspiracy that had achieved its single objective well before\n\nthe  acts of concealment that  were claimed to  extend it for\n\npurposes  of the statute  of limitations.3   Perhaps  more in\n\npoint  is the statement in  United States v.  Mayes, 512 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n637,  642 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1008 (1975) that\n                                  \n\n\"[w]here  a conspiracy  contemplates a continuity  of purpose\n\nand  a continued performance of acts, it is presumed to exist\n\nuntil  there  has been  an  affirmative showing  that  it has\n\nterminated . . . .\"  In all events, the jury in this case was\n\ncertainly entitled  to infer from all  of the circumstances--\n\napparent  size  of the  drug  ring,  its duration,  Moretto's\n\nthreats, and the threats' references to others--that the ring\n\ncontinued and Moretto rejoined it.\n\n     Separately,  Moretto claims  that the  evidence  did not\n\nsupport the jury's  guilty verdict against him on  the charge\n\nof  witness intimidation  under 18  U.S.C.    1512(b).   That\n\nstatute in  pertinent part forbids any  act of \"intimidation\"\n\n                    \n\n     3Similarly, in United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1 (1st\n                                            \nCir. 1989), statements sought to be introduced under  the co-\nconspirator exception to the  hearsay rule occurred after the\nfraudulent scheme had \"collapsed.\"\n\n                             -11-\n\ndone  with intent  to induce  anyone to  \"withhold testimony\"\n\nfrom  a grand jury or  other official proceeding.   The three\n\ntelephone conversations in this  case, recorded by Polito and\n\nplayed to the  jury, are replete  with statements by  Moretto\n\nthat the jury could reasonably  have found to be intimidating\n\nin both nature  and intent.   A brief  sampling of  Moretto's\n\nstatements, omitting some rejoinders by Polito, conveys their\n\nflavor:\n\n          \"I just have a  message . . . .  You have\n          one  chance to  hear  this  and then  its\n          gonna be  somtin' that you  never want to\n          hear  and it's  like a  hairline fracture\n          away from it.   People knew  what's going\n          on.\"\n\n          \"Mark, we got friends all over the place,\n          right?  DEA,  state troopers,  everything\n          . . . .  [Y]ou  don't seem  to understand\n          that  everybody knows  that you  went and\n          talked  [to law enforcement agents] . . .\n          .  I got to call these people back .  . .\n          .  [T]hey just  want some assurance  that\n          nobody's going to no Grand Jury . . . .\" \n\n     The heart  of  Moretto's appeal  on this  count is  that\n\nduring the  first of  the conversations  on  June 12,  Polito\n\nasked  Moretto if  Moretto  was threatening  him and  Moretto\n\nresponded:  \"No, I'm not.   I am not.  I'm  relaying indirect\n\nmessages.  I'm  not threatening anybody.   I'm--I would never\n\nhurt  nobody.  I'm not that kind  of person.\"  The jury could\n\nreasonably view  this  statement, lodged  among  many  veiled\n\nthreats,  as  a  boilerplate  disclaimer,  coupled  with  the\n\nintimation that others  (\"I got to  call these people  back\")\n\n                             -12-\n\nwould inflict the harm if Moretto's warning were ignored.  If\n\nanything,  the statement enhances  the sinister  character of\n\nthe conversation.4\n\n                             III.\n\n     Willis, Elwell  and Moretto  each appeals his  sentence.\n\nWe consider their respective claims in that order.\n\n     Willis.  Willis was sentenced as a career offender under\n           \n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.1.  That  provision provides that a  defendant\n\nis placed in the  highest criminal history category and  that\n\nspecified minimum  offense levels apply,  if three conditions\n\nare met:   first, the defendant must be at least 18 years old\n\nat  the time of the instant offense; second, the offense must\n\nbe  a felony  that is either  a crime  of violence  or a drug\n\noffense; and third, the defendant must have \"two prior felony\n\nconvictions\" for such offenses.  It is undisputed that Willis\n\nmeets the  age condition,  that the  instant conviction is  a\n\ndrug offense  and  that he  had five  prior convictions,  one\n\nstate and  four federal, for five bank robberies committed on\n\ndifferent dates during a brief period in 1968.\n\n     Willis  argued  unsuccessfully  at  sentencing  that the\n\nprior bank  robberies should  be treated  as a  single felony\n\n                    \n\n     4Moretto's  brief  adopts  by   cross-reference  Moran's\nargument   that   the  trial   judge  gave   a  supplementary\ninstruction that  invited the  jury to ignore  the conspiracy\ncharged  in  the  indictment   and  convict  of  a  different\nconspiracy.  That argument is considered and rejected  in our\nseparate opinion in Moran. \n                         \n\n                             -13-\n\nbecause  the  definitions  provision  of  U.S.S.G.     4B  ( \n\n4B1.2(3))  provides   in   part  that   \"`two  prior   felony\n\nconvictions' means .  . .  [that the convictions  were for  a\n\ncrime of  violence or drug offense and  that] at least two of\n\nthe  .  . .  convictions  are  counted separately  under  the\n\nprovisions  of     4A1.1(a),  (b),  or  (c).\"    This  latter\n\nprovision,  designed to  determine the  number and  length of\n\n\"prior  sentence[s]\"  in  order  to   compute  a  defendant's\n\ncriminal  history  category  under  U.S.S.G.    4A,  in  turn\n\nprovides  in a  related  definition that  \"[p]rior  sentences\n\nimposed  in related cases are  to be treated  as one sentence\n                         \n\nfor  purposes  of     4A1.1(a),   (b)  and  (c).\"    U.S.S.G.\n\n  4A1.2(a)(2)  (emphasis  added).   The  commentary  to  that\n\nsection, id., app. note 3, pertinently provides:\n           \n\n          [P]rior sentences  are considered related\n          only if they resulted from  offenses that\n          (1)  occurred on  the same  occasion, (2)\n          were part of a  common scheme or plan, or\n          (3)  were  consolidated   for  trial   or\n          sentencing.  \n\n     Based on this language  Willis argued at sentencing that\n\nhis five  bank robberies were  part of  a common plan  to rob\n\nbanks and, in any event, that the sentences imposed--although\n\nnot   formally   in   consolidated   cases--were   concurrent\n\nsentences,   part  of   the   same  bargain,   and  thus   in\n\n\"constructively\"   consolidated   cases.     Willis   further\n\nrequested that,  if  his  proffer  of  these  facts  was  not\n\naccepted,  he  be   afforded  an   evidentiary  hearing   and\n\n                             -14-\n\nopportunity  for  fellow bank  robbers  to  testify to  their\n\ncommon  plan and  for  a former  attorney  to show  that  the\n\nsentences were concurrent and part  of the same plea bargain.\n\nThe district  court declined  to hold an  evidentiary hearing\n\nand concluded that the bank robbery convictions were separate\n\ncrimes.\n\n     At  first  blush,  it   might  seem  unlikely  that  the\n\nSentencing Commission intended  a defendant to escape  career\n\noffender status,  in the teeth  of two prior  convictions for\n\ndifferent  bank  robberies  at  different  times  and places,\n\nsimply because those  prior robberies were  assertedly linked\n\nby a further felony, namely, an overarching conspiracy to rob\n\nbanks that  could literally  be  called a  \"common scheme  or\n\nplan.\"  Of course,  two crimes might be so  closely related--\n\nfor example, an  assault committed  in the course  of a  bank\n\nrobbery--that  it  would  disserve  the plain  purpose  of  a\n\n\"repeat offender\"  statute to  treat convictions for  each as\n\ntwo  prior convictions.   But  five separate  bank robberies,\n\ncommitted with  the opportunity to pause  and reflect between\n\nthem  and  memorialized  by   convictions,  are  surely  what\n\nCongress  had in mind as  identifying a career  offender.  28\n\nU.S.C.     994(h).    One  might  therefore  doubt,  at least\n\ninitially, whether the Commission was aware that the contrary\n\nresult would follow from its commentary language whenever the\n\nbank robberies were part of a common plan.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     If  we were  satisfied  that the  outcome departed  from\n\nCommission intent, we might disregard the literal language of\n\nthe commentary  and treat as  a single conviction  only those\n\nconvictions  so closely  related  in time  and function  that\n\nseparate treatment  would disserve the purpose  of the career\n\noffender provision.  Yet  a broader perspective suggests that\n\nthe Commission, in defining  related convictions, did mean to\n\nadopt binding \"rules of  thumb,\" such as this one, as well as\n\nthe even  more mechanical rule that  convictions for entirely\n\nseparate crimes should be treated as one if they happen to be\n\nconsolidated for trial or  sentence.  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(a)(2).\n\nIn fact, the Commission in the same paragraph recognized that\n\nthese rules  of thumb could understate  criminal history, and\n\nit said that the remedy in  such cases was for the sentencing\n\njudge to employ an upward departure.  Id.5\n                                        \n\n     To  conclude that the  Commission intended  the apparent\n\nresult  of its literal  language does not  resolve the matter\n\nsince  we  might  still decide  that  a  rule  of thumb  that\n\nproduces  such a result is unfaithful to the guideline and to\n\nthe career  offender  statute  that  lies  behind  it.    But\n\n                    \n\n     5In the commentary paragraph containing both the \"single\nscheme  or   plan\"  and   the  \"consolidated  for   trial  or\nsentencing\" provisions, the Commission continued:  \"The court\nshould be aware  that there  may be instances  in which  this\ndefinition is overly broad and will result in [an inadequate]\ncriminal history score  . . .  .  In  such circumstances,  an\nupward departure may  be warranted.\"  U.S.S.G.    4A1.2, app.\nnote 3.\n\n                             -16-\n\nCongress in 28 U.S.C.    994(h) authorized the  Commission to\n                                                          \n\ndevelop  guidelines to assure  that career  offenders receive\n\nhigh sentences; and we  are loath to hold that  the mechanism\n\ndeveloped by the Commission (and submitted to Congress) falls\n\noutside  that authority,  even if  there is  a Rube  Goldberg\n\naspect to the use of overbroad rules of thumb tempered by the\n\npower  to depart.  The Second Circuit has treated the \"common\n\nscheme or plan\" language  as binding, while eloquently urging\n\nthe  Commission to reexamine  its \"related cases\" commentary.\n\nUnited States Butler, 970 F.2d 1017  (2d Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n113 S. Ct. 480 (1992). \n\n     Once  we  decide  that   the  \"common  scheme  or  plan\"\n\ndefinition is both intentional and valid, it follows that the\n\n\"common scheme or plan\" language should be given its ordinary\n\nmeaning.  This same language is used in Fed. R. Crim P. 8 (to\n\ndetermine joinder) and there is no doubt that in that context\n\na conspiracy to rob banks would constitute a common scheme or\n\nplan.   Willis offered to call fellow bank robbers to confirm\n\nthat  his  robberies were  part of  the same  conspiracy, and\n\nthere is  nothing implausible about his  proffer, however odd\n\nit might seem to  conduct this inquiry.  Other  circuits have\n\nrequired such evidentiary  hearings which, not  surprisingly,\n\ntend to  produce findings that the  multiple convictions were\n\nnot part of a common scheme  or plan.  E.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nChartier, 970 F.2d 1009 (2d Cir. 1992). \n        \n\n                             -17-\n\n     For the reasons indicated, we feel constrained to accept\n\nthe guideline commentary, to  conclude that the proffer could\n\nnot  be  ignored,  and  thus   to  remand  Willis'  case  for\n\nresentencing.6   We do not, however, think  that the district\n\ncourt is required to hold an evidentiary hearing if the court\n\nconcludes that it would impose the same sentence even without\n\nthe \"career offender\" label.  The guideline commentary itself\n\nasserts  that the  rule of  thumb here  invoked by  Willis is\n\noverinclusive and  invites judges to depart  upward where the\n\nrule  of  thumb  operates  to  understate  criminal  history.\n\nAccordingly,  the requirements for departure are satisfied if\n\nthe judge supportably concludes that--even assuming the truth\n\nof Willis'  proffer--five prior  bank robberies, united  by a\n\nconspiracy to rob banks, makes Willis deserving of a sentence\n\nsimilar to  that he would receive if  he were classified as a\n\ncareer offender.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\n\n     Whether or not  the outcome  proves to be  the same  for\n\nWillis, it is important  for future cases that the  integrity\n\nof the guideline regime  be preserved.  Under our  reading of\n\nthe guideline commentary, the district court may not classify\n\n                    \n\n     6The  government  says   that  the  district court  here\n\"found\" that there  was no common scheme or  plan and it says\ncorrectly  that  there  is  no automatic  requirement  of  an\nevidentiary hearing for every  contested issue.  But in  this\ncase,  Willis' proffer  is not  implausible on  its face  and\nthere  was  apparently  no  other  evidence  about  the  bank\nrobberies.   As we read the  transcript, the district court's\n\"finding\" actually derived from a narrowing interpretation of\nthe guideline language.\n\n                             -18-\n\nWillis  as  a  career offender,  assuming  the  truth of  his\n\nproffer proposing to  show a  common scheme or  plan; but  we\n\nrepeat (without prejudging  the facts of this  case) that the\n\ndistrict court does have  authority to depart upward, subject\n\nto appellate review.  18 U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).  The net effect\n\nis  to increase the range of discretion of the district judge\n\nin these situations,  which may be  just what the  Commission\n\nintended.   As we have  noted, an evidentiary  hearing is not\n\nautomatically  required in cases  like this  one--not because\n\nthe judge can \"find\" no common scheme or plan in  the face of\n\na proffer like  this one  and without a  hearing, but  rather\n\nbecause  the judge may depart  rather readily even  if such a\n\nscheme or plan is assumed.7\n\n     Although Willis' case is to be remanded, we consider his\n\nother  claims of error, both for the guidance of the district\n\ncourt   and  to   reduce  the   need  for   further  appeals.\n\nSpecifically,  Willis argues  that he  was wrongly  denied an\n\nevidentiary  hearing   on  two   issues   important  to   his\n\nsentencing, namely, the  amount of cocaine  for which he  was\n\n                    \n\n     7We  reject  Willis'  further  argument  that  the  bank\nrobbery convictions, even  though not formally  consolidated,\nshould be deemed \"constructively\" consolidated because of the\nalleged plea bargain and concurrent  sentences.  The fact  is\nthat  the cases  were not  consolidated.   Whatever anomalies\nresult  from  the  accident  of consolidation  vel  non,  the\n                                                       \nsituation   is  not   going  to   be  improved   by  treating\nunconsolidated   cases   as  \"constructively\"   consolidated,\nthereby broadening  beyond its language an  already overbroad\nrule of  thumb.  See  United States v.  Rivers, 929 F.2d  136\n                                              \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 431 (1991).\n                        \n\n                             -19-\n\nresponsible and his leadership status.  We think the district\n\ncourt properly resolved these matters.\n\n     At the sentencing, the  judge determined that Willis was\n\nresponsible for 2.2 kilos,  resulting in a base level  of 28,\n\nU.S.S.G.       2D1.1(a)(3),  (c)(8),   and  was  a   \"leader\"\n\nwarranting an upward adjustment.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1.  However,\n\ninstead of  adopting the  resulting offense level,  the judge\n\nruled that Willis was a  career offender, making him  subject\n\n(in light of the maximum sentence to which  he was liable) to\n\na  base level of  32.  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1    The court reduced\n\nthis  figure by  2 levels  for acceptance  of responsibility.\n\nThe  court  then sentenced  Willis at  the  top of  the range\n\nprovided  by  the sentencing  table  for a  criminal  with an\n\noffense level of  30 and  a criminal history  category of  VI\n\n(which  is automatic  under U.S.S.G.      4B1.1 for  a career\n\noffender).\n\n     In finding  Willis  to be  a  leader and  computing  the\n\namount of cocaine, the  judge relied upon information adduced\n\nat the trial of Willis' co-defendants and on other government\n\ntape  recordings  not  introduced   at  the  trial  but  made\n\navailable for the sentencing.   On appeal Willis insists that\n\nhe  was entitled to an  evidentiary hearing on  the amount of\n\ncocaine.   Neither the amount  of cocaine nor  the leadership\n\nfinding affected the guideline  range adopted by the district\n\ncourt  since  the career  offender  guideline superseded  the\n\n                             -20-\n\n\"otherwise  applicable  offense level.\"    U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.\n\nNevertheless, because  the leadership role of  Willis and the\n\namounts  of  cocaine  handled  by  his  ring  might  well  be\n\npertinent  to  the district  court's  sentencing decision  on\n\nremand, we address Willis' objections.\n\n     The law concerning the need for evidentiary hearings has\n\nbeen  left  primarily   to  development  through   individual\n\ndecisions, which themselves  reflect the tension between  two\n\nattitudes: the  history  of almost  unreviewable trial  judge\n\ndiscretion in  sentencing and the present  specificity of the\n\nguidelines.  See U.S.S.G.    6A1.3.  Here, however,  there is\n                \n\nno  need for any lengthy discourse on sentencing hearings.  A\n\nprima facie case existed, based on the presentence report and\n\nthe evidence  adduced at the co-defendants'  trial, to regard\n\nWillis  as  playing  a leading  role  in  a  ring dealing  in\n\nsubstantial quantities of  cocaine.  At  no point did  Willis\n\never  specify or proffer evidence that would be adduced in an\n\nevidentiary hearing  to negate the amounts or Willis' role as\n\nleader.    Under these  circumstances, it  is patent  that no\n\nhearing  was required.   United States v.  Shattuck, 961 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1012, 1015 (1st Cir. 1992).   Lastly,   Willis  argues   that\n\nbecause the prior convictions were used to trigger the career\n\noffender  guideline,  the government  had  to  file a  notice\n\nspecifying the  prior convictions before  Willis' guilty plea\n\nin  this case.  21 U.S.C.    851 (prior notice is a condition\n\n                             -21-\n\nof \"increased punishment\").   Willis'  argument that  section\n\n851  applies to  guideline  increases, as  well as  statutory\n\nmaximums,  was rejected  by this  court in  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nSanchez, 917 F.2d 607,  616 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  111 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. 1625 (1991).  We decline the invitation to reexamine that\n\ndecision.\n\n     Elwell.    Elwell  was   convicted  of  conspiracy,  two\n           \n\ndistribution counts, and wilfully  filing a false tax return,\n\nand he was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment.  The sentence\n\nwas the minimum allowed under the guideline range in light of\n\nthe finding  that  he had  distributed  at least  500  grams.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1(a)(3), (c)(3).\n\n     Elwell first contests the finding that he did distribute\n\nat least 500 grams.  He  admits the distribution to Polito of\n\nabout  3 ounces  (approximately  84 grams)  for which  he was\n\nconvicted; indeed, Elwell admitted  at sentencing that he had\n\nsold  more to Polito without  specifying a number.   At trial\n\nPolito testified  that, apart from  the 3 ounces,  Elwell had\n\ndelivered \"18, maybe 20\"  ounces of cocaine to  Polito during\n\nthe summer of 1988.  The judge accepted this evidence despite\n\nElwell's denial at the sentencing hearing that he had sold so\n\nlarge a  quantity.  Even the  low-end figure of 18  ounces is\n\n504 grams, exceeding the guideline minimum of 500 grams.\n\n     The  critical facts by which a  guideline range is fixed\n\nmust  be proved  by a  preponderance of  the  evidence, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\n                             -22-\n\nUnited States v. Blanco,  888 F.2d 907, 909 (1st  Cir. 1989).\n                       \n\nWhile inviting us to raise or at least stiffen this standard,\n\nElwell's  main argument  is  that Polito's  estimate was  too\n\ncasual  to  support the  drastic  increase  in sentence  that\n\nresults  for  distributing  18  rather than  3  ounces.    He\n\nstresses  the fact that Polito was himself a user during this\n\nperiod  and admitted  to  hazy recollections  or mistakes  in\n\nother  testimony.   Combining these  arguments, he  argues on\n\nappeal that the judge's determination was  clearly erroneous,\n\nthe standard properly  applied on review.   United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nAymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 1991).\n       \n\n     We disagree.   The district court,  which heard Polito's\n\ntestimony at  trial and Elwell's testimony  at the sentencing\n\nhearing,  was entitled  to  choose between  them.   The  time\n\nperiod  over which  Elwell  supplied Polito  and the  size of\n\nPolito's purchases were also  consistent with the 18-20 ounce\n\nfigure.  Against this  backdrop and in light of  the standard\n\nof review, we find  no error.  This conclusion  also disposes\n\nof Elwell's claim  that the larger  ounce figure was  wrongly\n\nused  in  determining  the  amount of  unreported  income  in\n\nsentencing under the tax count.\n\n     Elwell  objects  lastly  to  the  special  condition  of\n\nsupervised release that requires him to submit to random drug\n\ntesting,  as well as drug and  alcohol treatment, as directed\n\nby the Probation  Service.   Elwell objects that  his use  of\n\n                             -23-\n\ndrugs (cocaine  and previously  amphetamines) lay 5  years or\n\nmore  in the past, that nothing else supports this condition,\n\nand that  supervised release conditions  should \"involve[] no\n\ngreater  deprivation of liberty than necessary   . . . .\"  18\n\nU.S.C.    3583(d)(2).  We  believe that the  drug testing and\n\ntreatment requirement--if  deemed necessary by  the Probation\n\nService--lay  well  within the  district  court's discretion,\n\ngiven Elwell's past  use and  past dealing in  drugs.  As  to\n\nalcohol,  the failure  of Elwell  to raise this  objection at\n\nsentencing  or by  post-trial motion  makes it  impossible to\n\nassess  the  district  court's  reasons for  adding  in  this\n\ncondition  and,   in  our  view,  this   failure  waived  the\n\nobjection. \n\n     Moretto.   Moretto's sentence was based  on the district\n            \n\ncourt's  finding  that  he  should  be  treated  as a  career\n\noffender.  His  record showed two state court convictions for\n\nassault and related conduct in October 1987 and February 1990\n\nrespectively and a drug conviction for possession with intent\n\nto  distribute in March 1988.  In the district court, Moretto\n\nargued that  the assault convictions were  misdemeanors under\n\nstate  law,  but the  trial judge  found  them to  qualify as\n\nfelonies for guideline purposes.  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.2,  app.\n\nnote  3 (prior felony  conviction includes offense punishable\n\nby  more than one year imprisonment even if not designated as\n\na felony).\n\n                             -24-\n\n     On appeal,  Moretto asserts that the  trial court relied\n\non  the  two   state  assault  charges  to  find   two  prior\n\nconvictions.  Moretto then argues that while the October 1987\n\nconviction  may be  a \"prior\"  felony conviction,  the latter\n\nassault conviction in February  1990 occurred after the start\n                                                   \n\nin 1988 of the conspiracy for which  he was convicted in this\n\ncase.   In reply, the  government says that  this argument is\n\nwaived  because not made below; that in any event the instant\n\nconspiracy  continued  after  the February  1990  conviction,\n\nmaking it a prior  conviction under the guidelines;  and that\n\nthe  first  assault   conviction  and  the   drug  possession\n\nconviction  both  remain  even   if  the  second  assault  is\n\ndisregarded. \n\n     Waivers  are occasionally forgiven  and the government's\n\nreliance on  the March 1988 drug  conviction could presumably\n\nbe assailed on  the same  ground that Moretto  now offers  to\n\nexclude  the  February  1990  conviction  from consideration,\n\nnamely, that it occurred  after the instant conspiracy began.\n\nBut  we   think  the  ground  is   clearly  wrong:  continued\n\nparticipation  in  a  conspiracy after  a  felony  conviction\n\nrenders that conviction  a prior felony conviction.   This is\n\napparent from  both the letter and intent  of the guidelines,\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(3)(\"defendant committed the  instant offense\n\nsubsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions  . .\n\n                             -25-\n\n. .\"), and thus there was no error in sentencing Moretto as a\n\ncareer offender.\n\n     The  judgments are  affirmed except  as to  Willis whose\n                                 \n\ncase  is remanded  for resentencing  in accordance  with this\n                 \n\nopinion.\n\n                             -26-\n",

Other\n\ncountsin the indictment chargedvarious of the defendants with\n\n                             -5-\n\nrelated  crimes.   Willis  and  several  others pled  guilty,\n\nWillis pleading to conspiracy and five counts of distribution\n\nunder  21 U.S.C.     841.   After  trial the  jury  convicted\n\nMoretto,  Elwell, and  George  Moran (whose  appeal has  been\n\nseparately decided) of conspiracy.   In addition, Moretto was\n\nfound  guilty of witness intimidation, 18  U.S.C.   1512, and\n\nElwell  of three counts of distribution, 21 U.S.C.   841, and\n\none of filing a false tax return.  26 U.S.C.   7206.\n\n     The critical testimony at  trial, except in the case  of\n\nMoran,  came primarily  from Mark  Polito, whose  account was\n\nbolstered  by  police  testimony  and tape  recordings.    He\n\ntestified that during  the spring of 1988  he purchased ounce\n\nquantities  of  cocaine  every  week  or  two  from  Moretto.\n\nBecause Moretto was scheduled to report to prison for a prior\n\noffense, Moretto--according to Polito's testimony--arranged a\n\nmeeting between Polito  and Willis, \"the man he [Moretto] got\n\nhis stuff from.\"   At the meeting Willis agreed  to introduce\n\nPolito to  the  distributor  who  managed  Willis'  \"northern\n\nterritory.\"  A  few days  later Willis  introduced Polito  to\n\nElwell and  for the  next few months  Elwell supplied  Polito\n\nwith cocaine at the same price previously charged by Moretto.\n\n     Polito  eventually  fell behind  in payments  and, under\n\npressure  for payment  exerted by  Willis and  Elwell, Polito\n\nbegan to cooperate secretly with law enforcement authorities.\n\nNow buying  drugs  with  government  money,  Polito  recorded\n\n                             -6-\n\nconversations with Elwell and, on one occasion, brought a DEA\n\nundercover  agent to a meeting  with Elwell.   During a later\n\nsale,  Elwell  told  Polito  that  Willis  wanted  Polito  to\n\n\"remember\"  Moretto  at  Christmas,  Moretto  then  being  in\n\nprison.   This  reminder  was repeated  at  a later  meeting.\n\nEventually Elwell became suspicious of Polito, ceased to deal\n\nwith  him and in 1989 Willis began to supply Polito directly.\n\nThe last reported transaction  occurred on February 16, 1989,\n\nwhen  Polito  paid Willis  part of  the  money still  owed to\n\nElwell for prior purchases.\n\n     Moretto  was released from prison  on June 5,  1990.  On\n\nJune 11 and 12, 1990,  three telephone calls occurred between\n\nMoretto and  Polito, which  Polito secretly recorded.   Those\n\ncalls, described  below, formed the basis  of the obstruction\n\ncount against Moretto.  Nothing pertinent to the  charges was\n\nproved at trial  to have occurred after  June 12.   In August\n\n1990, the indictment was returned.\n\n     Following Willis'  guilty plea and the  trial of Elwell,\n\nMoretto and Moran,  the defendants were  sentenced.    Willis\n\nand Moretto  were  found to  be  career offenders  under  the\n\nSentencing Guidelines and each was sentenced to 210 months in\n\nprison.   Elwell  was sentenced  to 78  months.   The present\n\nappeals followed.\n\n                             -7-\n\n                             II.\n\n     Moretto's main  argument on appeal is  that the evidence\n\nof his adherence to the  conspiracy charged in the indictment\n\nwas  too weak  to permit a  reasonable jury  to convict.   He\n\nfurther  argues that,  at most,  the evidence  showed several\n\nconspiracies  rather  than  the  single one  charged  in  the\n\nindictment,  and  he  asserts  that  this  supposed  variance\n\nbetween the conspiracy charged  and any conspiracy proved was\n\nprejudicial.    We  need  not treat  the  prejudice  argument\n\nseparately because we conclude that the evidence  adequately,\n\nif  not amply, supported  the government's claim  of a single\n\nconspiracy  involving Willis  and  others  in  which  Moretto\n\nparticipated.\n\n     Moretto does not dispute  that Willis directed a cocaine\n\nring  but,  carving his  own role  into  phases, he  seeks to\n\ndistance himself from  the ring.  Moretto's repeated sales of\n\ncocaine to Polito in the first part of 1988, which were amply\n\nproved, are claimed by  Moretto to fall outside the  ambit of\n\nthe  Willis ring.1   Moretto  then argues  that he  could not\n\n                    \n\n     1Moretto   places  stress  upon   a  statement   of  the\nprosecutor, made to  the judge in a pretrial conference, that\nthe conspiracy charged by the  government began in March 1988\nwhen  Moretto  introduced Polito  to  Willis.   Although  the\nprosecutor did make such a statement--seemingly a slip of the\ntongue--the government's actual theory of  the conspiracy was\nthat it reached  back to embrace Moretto's  earlier sales, as\nthe  prosecutor made fairly clear  at the bottom  of the same\ntranscript page  and even clearer  two pages  later.   There,\nresponding to the judge's question (\"The Government's  theory\nis that there  was some association between them [Moretto and\n\n                             -8-\n\nhave  participated in the ring  from March 1988  to June 1990\n\nsince he  was in prison.  As to the conversations with Polito\n\non June 11-12, 1990, Moretto says that--even assuming them to\n\nbe  obstructive--they  occurred well  after  the last  proved\n\ntransaction of  Willis and Polito  on February 16,  1989, and\n\ntherefore occurred after the conspiracy.  \n\n     The jury was entitled  to link these supposedly separate\n\nevents together with  certain connecting  facts that  Moretto\n\nomits.   The drug  sales he made to  Polito during early l988\n\nwere,  the  jury  could  have concluded,  based  on  supplies\n\nfurnished  by   Willis;   Moretto,  according   to   Polito's\n\ntestimony, said that  Willis was  \"the man he  got his  stuff\n\nfrom.\"    The jury could  also have thought  that the Willis-\n\nMoretto relationship was a continuing one since, when Moretto\n\nwas forced to  report to  prison, he introduced  Willis as  a\n\nsubstitute supplier.  Willis  then arranged for further sales\n\nto Polito at Moretto's  original price.  One act,  after all,\n\ncan take  color from others,  and drawing such  inferences is\n\nthe jury's task.\n\n     During  Moretto's first  year in  prison there  is ample\n\nevidence of continued  sales by Elwell and  Willis to Polito.\n\nMoretto, although  in prison,  was  not entirely  out of  the\n\npicture: Elwell twice  told Polito that Willis  wanted him to\n\n                    \n\nWillis] prior  to that  introduction [of Polito  to Willis]),\nthe  prosecutor stated, \"Yes, from Moretto up the ladder  . .\n. .\" \n\n                             -9-\n\n\"remember\" or not forget Moretto at Christmas.  While various\n\ninferences  can be drawn from these reminders, the jury could\n\nhave believed that they reinforced Moretto's connection  with\n\nthe  ongoing  conspiracy (even  assuming,  as the  government\n\nseems to do  in its brief, that Moretto was not a participant\n\nwhile  imprisoned).2   Specifically,  the evidence  increases\n\nthe  likelihood, however  slightly, that  Moretto was  once a\n\nconspirator and might rejoin the conspiracy after prison.\n\n     The jury could then  have concluded that, in making  the\n\ntelephone calls to  Polito in June  1990, Moretto did  rejoin\n\nthe conspiracy.   It is  true that  the time gap  between the\n\nlast proved Willis ring transaction  in February 1989 and the\n\ncalls in  June 1990  is substantial.   But the  jury was  not\n\nobliged to  believe that  a well  organized drug  ring, which\n\nenjoyed  a  \"northern  territory\"  and  remembered  a  former\n\nassociate at Christmas, had suddenly expired.  When this same\n\nformer foot soldier is discovered in June  1990 threatening a\n\nwitness, who  is believed  likely to  testify  to the  ring's\n\n                    \n\n     2The government's brief in  fact points to evidence that\nMoretto  while  in  prison  telephoned  Polito's  mother   to\nthreaten Polito for failing to pay his drug-purchasing debts.\nThat  evidence may  not have been  admissible because  of its\nhearsay  character--apparently  the  initial  source  of  the\nevidence was Polito's mother, who  did not testify.  However,\nthis  evidence  is not  challenged  on this  appeal,  and the\nremaining evidence  against Moretto is adequate  even if this\nevidence, largely  embodied in a single  sentence of Polito's\ntestimony, is ignored.  \n\n                             -10-\n\nactivities,  the  jury might  well  have  concluded that  the\n\nconspiracy was ongoing and the soldier had just reenlisted.\n\n      Grunewald  v.

The three\n\ntelephone conversations in this  case, recorded by Polito and\n\nplayed to the  jury, are replete  with statements by  Moretto\n\nthat the jury could reasonably  have found to be intimidating\n\nin both nature  and intent.   A brief  sampling of  Moretto's\n\nstatements, omitting some rejoinders by Polito, conveys their\n\nflavor:\n\n          \"I just have a  message . . . .  You have\n          one  chance to  hear  this  and then  its\n          gonna be  somtin' that you  never want to\n          hear  and it's  like a  hairline fracture\n          away from it.

I am not.  I'm  relaying indirect\n\nmessages.  I'm  not threatening anybody.   I'm--I would never\n\nhurt  nobody.  I'm not that kind  of person.\"  The jury could\n\nreasonably view  this  statement, lodged  among  many  veiled\n\nthreats,  as  a  boilerplate  disclaimer,  coupled  with  the\n\nintimation that others  (\"I got to  call these people  back\")\n\n                             -12-\n\nwould inflict the harm if Moretto's warning were ignored.  If\n\nanything,  the statement enhances  the sinister  character of\n\nthe conversation.4\n\n                             III.\n\n     Willis, Elwell  and Moretto  each appeals his  sentence.\n\nWe consider their respective claims in that order.\n\n     Willis.  Willis was sentenced as a career offender under\n           \n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.1.  That  provision provides that a  defendant\n\nis placed in the  highest criminal history category and  that\n\nspecified minimum  offense levels apply,  if three conditions\n\nare met:   first, the defendant must be at least 18 years old\n\nat  the time of the instant offense; second, the offense must\n\nbe  a felony  that is either  a crime  of violence  or a drug\n\noffense; and third, the defendant must have \"two prior felony\n\nconvictions\" for such offenses.  It is undisputed that Willis\n\nmeets the  age condition,  that the  instant conviction is  a\n\ndrug offense  and  that he  had five  prior convictions,  one\n\nstate and  four federal, for five bank robberies committed on\n\ndifferent dates during a brief period in 1968.\n\n     Willis  argued  unsuccessfully  at  sentencing  that the\n\nprior bank  robberies should  be treated  as a  single felony\n\n                    \n\n     4Moretto's  brief  adopts  by   cross-reference  Moran's\nargument   that   the  trial   judge  gave   a  supplementary\ninstruction that  invited the  jury to ignore  the conspiracy\ncharged  in  the  indictment   and  convict  of  a  different\nconspiracy.  That argument is considered and rejected  in our\nseparate opinion in Moran. \n                         \n\n                             -13-\n\nbecause  the  definitions  provision  of  U.S.S.G.     4B  ( \n\n4B1.2(3))  provides   in   part  that   \"`two  prior   felony\n\nconvictions' means .  . .  [that the convictions  were for  a\n\ncrime of  violence or drug offense and  that] at least two of\n\nthe  .  . .  convictions  are  counted separately  under  the\n\nprovisions  of     4A1.1(a),  (b),  or  (c).\"    This  latter\n\nprovision,  designed to  determine the  number and  length of\n\n\"prior  sentence[s]\"  in  order  to   compute  a  defendant's\n\ncriminal  history  category  under  U.S.S.G.    4A,  in  turn\n\nprovides  in a  related  definition that  \"[p]rior  sentences\n\nimposed  in related cases are  to be treated  as one sentence\n                         \n\nfor  purposes  of     4A1.1(a),   (b)  and  (c).\"    U.S.S.G.\n\n  4A1.2(a)(2)  (emphasis  added).   The  commentary  to  that\n\nsection, id., app. note 3, pertinently provides:\n           \n\n          [P]rior sentences  are considered related\n          only if they resulted from  offenses that\n          (1)  occurred on  the same  occasion, (2)\n          were part of a  common scheme or plan, or\n          (3)  were  consolidated   for  trial   or\n          sentencing.  \n\n     Based on this language  Willis argued at sentencing that\n\nhis five  bank robberies were  part of  a common plan  to rob\n\nbanks and, in any event, that the sentences imposed--although\n\nnot   formally   in   consolidated   cases--were   concurrent\n\nsentences,   part  of   the   same  bargain,   and  thus   in\n\n\"constructively\"   consolidated   cases.     Willis   further\n\nrequested that,  if  his  proffer  of  these  facts  was  not\n\naccepted,  he  be   afforded  an   evidentiary  hearing   and\n\n                             -14-\n\nopportunity  for  fellow bank  robbers  to  testify to  their\n\ncommon  plan and  for  a former  attorney  to show  that  the\n\nsentences were concurrent and part  of the same plea bargain.\n\nThe district  court declined  to hold an  evidentiary hearing\n\nand concluded that the bank robbery convictions were separate\n\ncrimes.\n\n     At  first  blush,  it   might  seem  unlikely  that  the\n\nSentencing Commission intended  a defendant to escape  career\n\noffender status,  in the teeth  of two prior  convictions for\n\ndifferent  bank  robberies  at  different  times  and places,\n\nsimply because those  prior robberies were  assertedly linked\n\nby a further felony, namely, an overarching conspiracy to rob\n\nbanks that  could literally  be  called a  \"common scheme  or\n\nplan.\"  Of course,  two crimes might be so  closely related--\n\nfor example, an  assault committed  in the course  of a  bank\n\nrobbery--that  it  would  disserve  the plain  purpose  of  a\n\n\"repeat offender\"  statute to  treat convictions for  each as\n\ntwo  prior convictions.   But  five separate  bank robberies,\n\ncommitted with  the opportunity to pause  and reflect between\n\nthem  and  memorialized  by   convictions,  are  surely  what\n\nCongress  had in mind as  identifying a career  offender.  28\n\nU.S.C.     994(h).    One  might  therefore  doubt,  at least\n\ninitially, whether the Commission was aware that the contrary\n\nresult would follow from its commentary language whenever the\n\nbank robberies were part of a common plan.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     If  we were  satisfied  that the  outcome departed  from\n\nCommission intent, we might disregard the literal language of\n\nthe commentary  and treat as  a single conviction  only those\n\nconvictions  so closely  related  in time  and function  that\n\nseparate treatment  would disserve the purpose  of the career\n\noffender provision.  Yet  a broader perspective suggests that\n\nthe Commission, in defining  related convictions, did mean to\n\nadopt binding \"rules of  thumb,\" such as this one, as well as\n\nthe even  more mechanical rule that  convictions for entirely\n\nseparate crimes should be treated as one if they happen to be\n\nconsolidated for trial or  sentence.  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(a)(2).\n\nIn fact, the Commission in the same paragraph recognized that\n\nthese rules  of thumb could understate  criminal history, and\n\nit said that the remedy in  such cases was for the sentencing\n\njudge to employ an upward departure.  Id.5\n                                        \n\n     To  conclude that the  Commission intended  the apparent\n\nresult  of its literal  language does not  resolve the matter\n\nsince  we  might  still decide  that  a  rule  of thumb  that\n\nproduces  such a result is unfaithful to the guideline and to\n\nthe career  offender  statute  that  lies  behind  it.    But\n\n                    \n\n     5In the commentary paragraph containing both the \"single\nscheme  or   plan\"  and   the  \"consolidated  for   trial  or\nsentencing\" provisions, the Commission continued:  \"The court\nshould be aware  that there  may be instances  in which  this\ndefinition is overly broad and will result in [an inadequate]\ncriminal history score  . . .  .  In  such circumstances,  an\nupward departure may  be warranted.\"  U.S.S.G.    4A1.2, app.\nnote 3.\n\n                             -16-\n\nCongress in 28 U.S.C.    994(h) authorized the  Commission to\n                                                          \n\ndevelop  guidelines to assure  that career  offenders receive\n\nhigh sentences; and we  are loath to hold that  the mechanism\n\ndeveloped by the Commission (and submitted to Congress) falls\n\noutside  that authority,  even if  there is  a Rube  Goldberg\n\naspect to the use of overbroad rules of thumb tempered by the\n\npower  to depart.  The Second Circuit has treated the \"common\n\nscheme or plan\" language  as binding, while eloquently urging\n\nthe  Commission to reexamine  its \"related cases\" commentary.\n\nUnited States Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587578\"><a href=\"/opinion/587578/united-states-v-wakeem-butler-stanley-harris-and-marcellus-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (2d Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This same language is used in Fed. R. Crim P. 8 (to\n\ndetermine joinder) and there is no doubt that in that context\n\na conspiracy to rob banks would constitute a common scheme or\n\nplan.   Willis offered to call fellow bank robbers to confirm\n\nthat  his  robberies were  part of  the same  conspiracy, and\n\nthere is  nothing implausible about his  proffer, however odd\n\nit might seem to  conduct this inquiry.  Other  circuits have\n\nrequired such evidentiary  hearings which, not  surprisingly,\n\ntend to  produce findings that the  multiple convictions were\n\nnot part of a common scheme  or plan.  E.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nChartier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587577\"><a href=\"/opinion/587577/united-states-v-paul-c-chartier/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1992). \n        \n\n                             -17-\n\n     For the reasons indicated, we feel constrained to accept\n\nthe guideline commentary, to  conclude that the proffer could\n\nnot  be  ignored,  and  thus   to  remand  Willis'  case  for\n\nresentencing.6   We do not, however, think  that the district\n\ncourt is required to hold an evidentiary hearing if the court\n\nconcludes that it would impose the same sentence even without\n\nthe \"career offender\" label.  The guideline commentary itself\n\nasserts  that the  rule of  thumb here  invoked by  Willis is\n\noverinclusive and  invites judges to depart  upward where the\n\nrule  of  thumb  operates  to  understate  criminal  history.\n\nAccordingly,  the requirements for departure are satisfied if\n\nthe judge supportably concludes that--even assuming the truth\n\nof Willis'  proffer--five prior  bank robberies, united  by a\n\nconspiracy to rob banks, makes Willis deserving of a sentence\n\nsimilar to  that he would receive if  he were classified as a\n\ncareer offender.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\n\n     Whether or not  the outcome  proves to be  the same  for\n\nWillis, it is important  for future cases that the  integrity\n\nof the guideline regime  be preserved.  Under our  reading of\n\nthe guideline commentary, the district court may not classify\n\n                    \n\n     6The  government  says   that  the  district court  here\n\"found\" that there  was no common scheme or  plan and it says\ncorrectly  that  there  is  no automatic  requirement  of  an\nevidentiary hearing for every  contested issue.  But in  this\ncase,  Willis' proffer  is not  implausible on  its face  and\nthere  was  apparently  no  other  evidence  about  the  bank\nrobberies.   As we read the  transcript, the district court's\n\"finding\" actually derived from a narrowing interpretation of\nthe guideline language.\n\n                             -18-\n\nWillis  as  a  career offender,  assuming  the  truth of  his\n\nproffer proposing to  show a  common scheme or  plan; but  we\n\nrepeat (without prejudging  the facts of this  case) that the\n\ndistrict court does have  authority to depart upward, subject\n\nto appellate review.  18 U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).  The net effect\n\nis  to increase the range of discretion of the district judge\n\nin these situations,  which may be  just what the  Commission\n\nintended.   As we have  noted, an evidentiary  hearing is not\n\nautomatically  required in cases  like this  one--not because\n\nthe judge can \"find\" no common scheme or plan in  the face of\n\na proffer like  this one  and without a  hearing, but  rather\n\nbecause  the judge may depart  rather readily even  if such a\n\nscheme or plan is assumed.7\n\n     Although Willis' case is to be remanded, we consider his\n\nother  claims of error, both for the guidance of the district\n\ncourt   and  to   reduce  the   need  for   further  appeals.\n\nSpecifically,  Willis argues  that he  was wrongly  denied an\n\nevidentiary  hearing   on  two   issues   important  to   his\n\nsentencing, namely, the  amount of cocaine  for which he  was\n\n                    \n\n     7We  reject  Willis'  further  argument  that  the  bank\nrobbery convictions, even  though not formally  consolidated,\nshould be deemed \"constructively\" consolidated because of the\nalleged plea bargain and concurrent  sentences.  The fact  is\nthat  the cases  were not  consolidated.   Whatever anomalies\nresult  from  the  accident  of consolidation  vel  non,  the\n                                                       \nsituation   is  not   going  to   be  improved   by  treating\nunconsolidated   cases   as  \"constructively\"   consolidated,\nthereby broadening  beyond its language an  already overbroad\nrule of  thumb.

We think the district\n\ncourt properly resolved these matters.\n\n     At the sentencing, the  judge determined that Willis was\n\nresponsible for 2.2 kilos,  resulting in a base level  of 28,\n\nU.S.S.G.       2D1.1(a)(3),  (c)(8),   and  was  a   \"leader\"\n\nwarranting an upward adjustment.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1.  However,\n\ninstead of  adopting the  resulting offense level,  the judge\n\nruled that Willis was a  career offender, making him  subject\n\n(in light of the maximum sentence to which  he was liable) to\n\na  base level of  32.  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1    The court reduced\n\nthis  figure by  2 levels  for acceptance  of responsibility.\n\nThe  court  then sentenced  Willis at  the  top of  the range\n\nprovided  by  the sentencing  table  for a  criminal  with an\n\noffense level of  30 and  a criminal history  category of  VI\n\n(which  is automatic  under U.S.S.G.      4B1.1 for  a career\n\noffender).\n\n     In finding  Willis  to be  a  leader and  computing  the\n\namount of cocaine, the  judge relied upon information adduced\n\nat the trial of Willis' co-defendants and on other government\n\ntape  recordings  not  introduced   at  the  trial  but  made\n\navailable for the sentencing.   On appeal Willis insists that\n\nhe  was entitled to an  evidentiary hearing on  the amount of\n\ncocaine.   Neither the amount  of cocaine nor  the leadership\n\nfinding affected the guideline  range adopted by the district\n\ncourt  since  the career  offender  guideline superseded  the\n\n                             -20-\n\n\"otherwise  applicable  offense level.\"    U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.\n\nNevertheless, because  the leadership role of  Willis and the\n\namounts  of  cocaine  handled  by  his  ring  might  well  be\n\npertinent  to  the district  court's  sentencing decision  on\n\nremand, we address Willis' objections.\n\n     The law concerning the need for evidentiary hearings has\n\nbeen  left  primarily   to  development  through   individual\n\ndecisions, which themselves  reflect the tension between  two\n\nattitudes: the  history  of almost  unreviewable trial  judge\n\ndiscretion in  sentencing and the present  specificity of the\n\nguidelines.  See U.S.S.G.    6A1.3.  Here, however,  there is\n                \n\nno  need for any lengthy discourse on sentencing hearings.  A\n\nprima facie case existed, based on the presentence report and\n\nthe evidence  adduced at the co-defendants'  trial, to regard\n\nWillis  as  playing  a leading  role  in  a  ring dealing  in\n\nsubstantial quantities of  cocaine.  At  no point did  Willis\n\never  specify or proffer evidence that would be adduced in an\n\nevidentiary hearing  to negate the amounts or Willis' role as\n\nleader.    Under these  circumstances, it  is patent  that no\n\nhearing  was required.   United States v.

He  admits the distribution to Polito of\n\nabout  3 ounces  (approximately  84 grams)  for which  he was\n\nconvicted; indeed, Elwell admitted  at sentencing that he had\n\nsold  more to Polito without  specifying a number.   At trial\n\nPolito testified  that, apart from  the 3 ounces,  Elwell had\n\ndelivered \"18, maybe 20\"  ounces of cocaine to  Polito during\n\nthe summer of 1988.  The judge accepted this evidence despite\n\nElwell's denial at the sentencing hearing that he had sold so\n\nlarge a  quantity.  Even the  low-end figure of 18  ounces is\n\n504 grams, exceeding the guideline minimum of 500 grams.\n\n     The  critical facts by which a  guideline range is fixed\n\nmust  be proved  by a  preponderance of  the  evidence, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\n                             -22-\n\nUnited States v.

He\n\nstresses  the fact that Polito was himself a user during this\n\nperiod  and admitted  to  hazy recollections  or mistakes  in\n\nother  testimony.   Combining these  arguments, he  argues on\n\nappeal that the judge's determination was  clearly erroneous,\n\nthe standard properly  applied on review.   United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nAymelek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1st Cir. 1991).\n       \n\n     We disagree.   The district court,  which heard Polito's\n\ntestimony at  trial and Elwell's testimony  at the sentencing\n\nhearing,  was entitled  to  choose between  them.   The  time\n\nperiod  over which  Elwell  supplied Polito  and the  size of\n\nPolito's purchases were also  consistent with the 18-20 ounce\n\nfigure.  Against this  backdrop and in light of  the standard\n\nof review, we find  no error.  This conclusion  also disposes\n\nof Elwell's claim  that the larger  ounce figure was  wrongly\n\nused  in  determining  the  amount of  unreported  income  in\n\nsentencing under the tax count.\n\n     Elwell  objects  lastly  to  the  special  condition  of\n\nsupervised release that requires him to submit to random drug\n\ntesting,  as well as drug and  alcohol treatment, as directed\n\nby the Probation  Service.   Elwell objects that  his use  of\n\n                             -23-\n\ndrugs (cocaine  and previously  amphetamines) lay 5  years or\n\nmore  in the past, that nothing else supports this condition,\n\nand that  supervised release conditions  should \"involve[] no\n\ngreater  deprivation of liberty than necessary   . . . .\"  18\n\nU.S.C.    3583(d)(2).  We  believe that the  drug testing and\n\ntreatment requirement--if  deemed necessary by  the Probation\n\nService--lay  well  within the  district  court's discretion,\n\ngiven Elwell's past  use and  past dealing in  drugs.  As  to\n\nalcohol,  the failure  of Elwell  to raise this  objection at\n\nsentencing  or by  post-trial motion  makes it  impossible to\n\nassess  the  district  court's  reasons for  adding  in  this\n\ncondition  and,   in  our  view,  this   failure  waived  the\n\nobjection. \n\n     Moretto.   Moretto's sentence was based  on the district\n            \n\ncourt's  finding  that  he  should  be  treated  as a  career\n\noffender.  His  record showed two state court convictions for\n\nassault and related conduct in October 1987 and February 1990\n\nrespectively and a drug conviction for possession with intent\n\nto  distribute in March 1988.  In the district court, Moretto\n\nargued that  the assault convictions were  misdemeanors under\n\nstate  law,  but the  trial judge  found  them to  qualify as\n\nfelonies for guideline purposes.  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.2,  app.\n\nnote  3 (prior felony  conviction includes offense punishable\n\nby  more than one year imprisonment even if not designated as\n\na felony).\n\n                             -24-\n\n     On appeal,  Moretto asserts that the  trial court relied\n\non  the  two   state  assault  charges  to  find   two  prior\n\nconvictions.  Moretto then argues that while the October 1987\n\nconviction  may be  a \"prior\"  felony conviction,  the latter\n\nassault conviction in February  1990 occurred after the start\n                                                   \n\nin 1988 of the conspiracy for which  he was convicted in this\n\ncase.   In reply, the  government says that  this argument is\n\nwaived  because not made below; that in any event the instant\n\nconspiracy  continued  after  the February  1990  conviction,\n\nmaking it a prior  conviction under the guidelines;  and that\n\nthe  first  assault   conviction  and  the   drug  possession\n\nconviction  both  remain  even   if  the  second  assault  is\n\ndisregarded. \n\n     Waivers  are occasionally forgiven  and the government's\n\nreliance on  the March 1988 drug  conviction could presumably\n\nbe assailed on  the same  ground that Moretto  now offers  to\n\nexclude  the  February  1990  conviction  from consideration,\n\nnamely, that it occurred  after the instant conspiracy began.\n\nBut  we   think  the  ground  is   clearly  wrong:  continued\n\nparticipation  in  a  conspiracy after  a  felony  conviction\n\nrenders that conviction  a prior felony conviction.   This is\n\napparent from  both the letter and intent  of the guidelines,\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(3)(\"defendant committed the  instant offense\n\nsubsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions  . .\n\n                             -25-\n\n. .\"), and thus there was no error in sentencing Moretto as a\n\ncareer offender.\n\n     The  judgments are  affirmed except  as to  Willis whose\n                                 \n\ncase  is remanded  for resentencing  in accordance  with this\n                 \n\nopinion.\n\n                             -26-\n</pre>",
