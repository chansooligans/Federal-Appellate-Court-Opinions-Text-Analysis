Watson, on brief pro se.\n                    \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.   The appellant,  Charles N. Watson,  was an\n               \n\ninmate in the Maine  correctional system, incarcerated at the\n\nDowneast  Correctional Facility, and  later at the Charleston\n\nCorrectional Facility, at all times relevant to this lawsuit.\n\nIn November  1991 Watson filed  a complaint in  federal court\n\nwhich alleged that the defendants, all officials of the Maine\n\nDepartment  of  Correction  or  the  Downeast  or  Charleston\n\nprisons, had  violated his federal constitutional  rights, in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C.   1983.\n\n     Watson's complaint contained four counts, only  three of\n\nwhich are  at issue  in this appeal.1   In  his first  count,\n\nWatson described injuries  he had sustained to his right hand\n\nbefore he went to prison.  The injuries had required surgery,\n\nand the hand continued  to cause problems.  After  he entered\n\nprison, beginning in February  1989, Watson sought treatment.\n\nThe  specialists he contacted would not travel to the prison,\n\nand  prison  officials  would not  allow  him  to  go to  the\n\ndoctors.    According  to  the  complaint,  defendant  Peggie\n\nMitchie, a  nurse  at  the  Downeast  Correctional  Facility,\n\nrefused  to  examine Watson's  hand  because  the injury  had\n\noccurred  before  he  went  to  prison,  and  she  said  that\n\n\"therefore she was not responsible  for care or treatment  of\n\n                    \n\n     1The  third count  of  the complaint  related to  dental\ntreatment  of a broken cap on a  front tooth.  Watson did not\nchallenge the dismissal of this count in his appellate brief,\nand  therefore  has  waived  the  issue.    Pignons  S.A.  de\n                                                             \nMecanique  v. Polaroid Corp., 701  F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir. 1983)\n                           \n(issues  not  presented  in  appellant's  opening  brief  are\nwaived).\n\nthat hand.\"   Thereafter Watson says  he continued to  suffer\n\nand  eventually a doctor did examine the hand and recommended\n\nanother round of surgery.\n\n     The second  count of  the complaint alleged  that Watson\n\nwas injured when he fell through a weak ceiling while working\n\nat the Downeast  prison.  He saw a nurse,  who treated a gash\n\non  his leg but declined to provide further treatment when he\n\ntold  her that he had also injured  his back, saying that his\n\nback  \"would be  okay.\"   Not  until  he transferred  to  the\n\nCharleston prison  did Watson receive treatment  for his back\n\ninjury;   but  even  then,  Watson  complained,  the  doctors\n\nprescribed only medication and bed  rest, and failed to order\n\nthe  physical   therapy  that   he  thought   was  necessary.\n\nEventually, the  injury required surgery, and  even after the\n\noperation Watson's back remained \"40% impaired.\"\n\n     Finally, Watson alleged in  his fourth count that, while\n\nhoused at the Downeast  Correctional Facility, he purchased a\n\nnumber of  cassette tapes and compact disks through the mail.\n\nWhen these items arrived at the prison, officials deemed them\n\n\"non-allowable\"  and did not deliver them to Watson.  Nor did\n\nthey provide  Watson with  a \"non-allowable  property sheet,\"\n\nwhich,   Watson  contends,   the  Department   of  Correction\n\n\"normally issues\" in such  situations.  A corrections officer\n\ndestroyed  the tapes and disks, but the prison did not notify\n\nWatson of  either the  delivery or  the destruction until  11\n\n                             -3-\n\ndays had passed.\n\n     In  addition to  his  complaint, Watson  filed with  the\n\ndistrict court  an application to proceed  in forma pauperis.\n                                                            \n\nActing  on  this request  before  any of  the  defendants had\n\nresponded to the complaint, the district court granted Watson\n\nin  forma pauperis status but dismissed  the complaint on its\n                  \n\nown motion under  28 U.S.C.    1915(d) with  a short  opinion\n\nstating  its reasons.   After the  district court  denied his\n\nmotion for  reconsideration  and motion  to vacate  judgment,\n\nWatson filed this appeal.\n\n     Under 28 U.S.C.    1915(d) a federal district  court may\n\ndismiss an in  forma pauperis complaint if  the complaint is,\n                             \n\namong  other things,  \"frivolous.\"   A  claim is  \"frivolous\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 1915(d) when it is \"based on an\n\nindisputably  meritless  legal  theory,\"  or  makes  \"clearly\n\nbaseless\" factual contentions.  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n319, 327 (1989).   We review a section 1915(d)  dismissal for\n\n\"abuse of  discretion,\" Denton v. Hernandez, 112 S. Ct. 1728,\n                                           \n\n1734  (1992),   taking  into  account  the  liberal  pleading\n\nstandards   applicable  to   complaints  filed   by  pro   se\n                                                             \n\nplaintiffs.\n\n     Watson's first two  counts alleged  that the  defendants\n\nfailed to provide, or caused delays in providing, appropriate\n\nmedical care.  The courts have consistently refused to create\n\nconstitutional  claims out of disagreements between prisoners\n\n                             -4-\n\nand doctors about the  proper course of a  prisoner's medical\n\ntreatment, or  to  conclude that  simple medical  malpractice\n\nrises to the  level of  cruel and unusual  punishment.   See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976);  DesRosiers\n                                                             \n\nv. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 19  (1st Cir. 1991).  However,  prison\n        \n\nofficials  and doctors  may violate  the Eighth  Amendment if\n\nthey  exhibit \"deliberate  indifference  to  serious  medical\n\nneeds.\"  Estelle  v. Gamble,  429 U.S. at  106.  The  obvious\n                           \n\ncase would be a  denial of needed medical treatment  in order\n\nto punish the inmate.   But deliberate indifference  may also\n\nreside in \"wanton\" decisions  to deny or delay care,   Wilson\n                                                             \n\nv. Seiter, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 2326 (1992), where  the action is\n         \n\nrecklessness,  \"not  in  the  tort  law  sense  but  in   the\n\nappreciably  stricter  criminal-law  sense, requiring  actual\n\nknowledge   of   impending    harm,   easily    preventable.\"\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19.\n          \n\n     Watson alleged in the first count of  his complaint that\n\nthe  prison nurse refused to  treat him for  an injury, which\n\nproved serious enough to  require surgery, on the non-medical\n\nground that the state was not responsible for injuries caused\n\nby  events that  occurred before  Watson entered  prison.   A\n\ndeliberate refusal to treat a serious medical condition of  a\n\nprisoner  on such  a ground  could hardly  be justified  and,\n\nwhile  the  allegations  may   prove  untrue,  they  are  not\n\n\"fantastic or delusional.\"   Estelle v.  Gamble, 490 U.S.  at\n                                               \n\n                             -5-\n\n328.    We  conclude  that  Watson's   first  count  was  not\n\nfrivolous,  although it  may--based on  further information--\n\nprove to be wholly without merit.   How and in what form that\n\ninformation is obtained is a matter for the district court to\n\ndecide in the  first instance; we note that the state has not\n\nyet filed an answer to this charge.\n\n     Watson's  second  count  relating  to  his  back  injury\n\npresents  a different question.   On its face,  the facts set\n\nforth allege only the  kind of disagreement about the  proper\n\ncourse  of treatment  that does  not rise to  the level  of a\n\nconstitutional  violation:  Watson wanted more attention from\n\nthe  nurse, who said that  no treatment was  needed; he later\n\nwanted  physical therapy  to be ordered  by the  doctors, who\n\nthought that drugs and rest would do the trick.\n\n     To   append   labels   like  \"wanton\"   or   \"deliberate\n\nindifference\" to this conduct, when nothing suggests that the\n\nmedical  judgment was  absurd or  that improper  reasons were\n\ngiven for refusing treatment, cannot alter what is in essence\n\na claim of  negligence.   The difference  between failing  to\n\nstate  a  claim  and making  a  frivolous  claim  is in  some\n\nsituations  a question of degree.  In this case we think that\n\nthe district court acted within  its considerable discretion,\n\nWilson, 111 S.  Ct. at  2326, in concluding  that this  count\n      \n\nstated no  facts suggesting  more than simple  negligence and\n\nthat,   since  simple  negligence  is  not  a  constitutional\n\n                             -6-\n\nviolation, the  claim was subject to  dismissal under section\n\n1915(d).2\n\n     Watson's  fourth  count  alleged that  prison  officials\n\nrefused to  deliver several cassette tapes  and compact discs\n\nto him, denying those items as \"non-allowable\" but failing to\n\ngive Watson a \"non-allowable  property sheet,\" and failing as\n\nwell  to notify  Watson that  the items  had  been delivered.\n\nInstead, Watson says,  a corrections officer destroyed  them.\n\nWatson does not complain directly of the decision to withhold\n\nthe property from him,  but rather of the lack  of notice and\n\nthe resulting  destruction of  the property before  he had  a\n\nchange  to have the items sent  back.  In other words, Watson\n\nhas raised an issue of procedural due process.\n\n     The Fourteenth  Amendment says that state  officials may\n\nnot deprive persons of property without \"due process of law.\"\n\nU.S.  Const., art.  XIV.   The  process  due depends  on  the\n\ncircumstances.    Mathews  v.  Eldridge, 424  U.S.  319,  335\n                                       \n\n(1976).  The  cases distinguish sharply  between deprivations\n\ncaused by  \"random, unauthorized\" conduct of state officials,\n\nand deprivations  caused by conduct \"pursuant  to established\n\nstate  procedure.\"  See Hudson  v. Palmer, 468  U.S. 517, 532\n                                         \n\n(1984).    For the  former,  the state  is  not automatically\n\n                    \n\n     2 Conceivably,  in the  remand in connection  with count\none,  Watson could  move for  leave to  replead count  two to\nallege facts amounting to a constitutional violation.   If he\ndid  so, we  assume  the court  would  give this  motion  due\nconsideration.  See Denton, 112 S. Ct. at 1734.\n                          \n\n                             -7-\n\nliable;3  in the latter case there may be liability where the\n\nstate  policy approves or directs the conduct but falls below\n\nconstitutional standards.\n\n     In  this  instance, Watson  does  not  suggest that  the\n\nofficer's conduct reflected a state policy.  His brief states\n\nthat \"a [s]upervisor took it upon his  own\" to throw away the\n\nproperty without giving  Watson notice or allowing him the 30\n\ndays permitted to prisoners to ship back non-allowable items.\n\nThe  complaint itself  asserts  that the  lack  of notice  to\n\nWatson involved  the failure to furnish  him \"a non-allowable\n\nproperty  sheet, which the Department of Corrections normally\n\nissues . . . . \"   The clear inference from these allegations\n\nis that the action was a deviation from, and not a reflection\n\nof,  an established  state procedure.   Under  the precedents\n\ncited,  such a  claim has no  legal basis  in a  section 1983\n\ncase.\n\n     We affirm  the judgment  below in dismissing  counts two\n              \n\nand four  of the  complaint.  As  to count  one, judgment  is\n\nvacated  and the  case  remanded for  further proceedings  in\n       \n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n     So Ordered.\n               \n\n                    \n\n     3The  officer allegedly responsible  for the destruction\nis apparently not a defendant in this case.   Watson does not\nallege that  the state refused to  provide a post-deprivation\nremedy for the alleged  wrong by the officer.   See Hudson v.\n                                                          \nPalmer, 468 U.S. at 533.\n      \n\n                             -8-\n",

A corrections officer\n\ndestroyed  the tapes and disks, but the prison did not notify\n\nWatson of  either the  delivery or  the destruction until  11\n\n                             -3-\n\ndays had passed.\n\n     In  addition to  his  complaint, Watson  filed with  the\n\ndistrict court  an application to proceed  in forma pauperis.\n                                                            \n\nActing  on  this request  before  any of  the  defendants had\n\nresponded to the complaint, the district court granted Watson\n\nin  forma pauperis status but dismissed  the complaint on its\n                  \n\nown motion under  28 U.S.C.    1915(d) with  a short  opinion\n\nstating  its reasons.   After the  district court  denied his\n\nmotion for  reconsideration  and motion  to vacate  judgment,\n\nWatson filed this appeal.\n\n     Under 28 U.S.C.    1915(d) a federal district  court may\n\ndismiss an in  forma pauperis complaint if  the complaint is,\n                             \n\namong  other things,  \"frivolous.\"   A  claim is  \"frivolous\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 1915(d) when it is \"based on an\n\nindisputably  meritless  legal  theory,\"  or  makes  \"clearly\n\nbaseless\" factual contentions.

However,  prison\n        \n\nofficials  and doctors  may violate  the Eighth  Amendment if\n\nthey  exhibit \"deliberate  indifference  to  serious  medical\n\nneeds.\"  Estelle  v. Gamble,  429 U.S. at  106.  The  obvious\n                           \n\ncase would be a  denial of needed medical treatment  in order\n\nto punish the inmate.   But deliberate indifference  may also\n\nreside in \"wanton\" decisions  to deny or delay care,   Wilson\n                                                             \n\nv.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2326 (1992), where  the action is\n         \n\nrecklessness,  \"not  in  the  tort  law  sense  but  in   the\n\nappreciably  stricter  criminal-law  sense, requiring  actual\n\nknowledge   of   impending    harm,   easily    preventable.\"\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19.\n          \n\n     Watson alleged in the first count of  his complaint that\n\nthe  prison nurse refused to  treat him for  an injury, which\n\nproved serious enough to  require surgery, on the non-medical\n\nground that the state was not responsible for injuries caused\n\nby  events that  occurred before  Watson entered  prison.   A\n\ndeliberate refusal to treat a serious medical condition of  a\n\nprisoner  on such  a ground  could hardly  be justified  and,\n\nwhile  the  allegations  may   prove  untrue,  they  are  not\n\n\"fantastic or delusional.\"   Estelle v.  Gamble, 490 U.S.  at\n                                               \n\n                             -5-\n\n328.    We  conclude  that  Watson's   first  count  was  not\n\nfrivolous,  although it  may--based on  further information--\n\nprove to be wholly without merit.   How and in what form that\n\ninformation is obtained is a matter for the district court to\n\ndecide in the  first instance; we note that the state has not\n\nyet filed an answer to this charge.\n\n     Watson's  second  count  relating  to  his  back  injury\n\npresents  a different question.   On its face,  the facts set\n\nforth allege only the  kind of disagreement about the  proper\n\ncourse  of treatment  that does  not rise to  the level  of a\n\nconstitutional  violation:  Watson wanted more attention from\n\nthe  nurse, who said that  no treatment was  needed; he later\n\nwanted  physical therapy  to be ordered  by the  doctors, who\n\nthought that drugs and rest would do the trick.\n\n     To   append   labels   like  \"wanton\"   or   \"deliberate\n\nindifference\" to this conduct, when nothing suggests that the\n\nmedical  judgment was  absurd or  that improper  reasons were\n\ngiven for refusing treatment, cannot alter what is in essence\n\na claim of  negligence.   The difference  between failing  to\n\nstate  a  claim  and making  a  frivolous  claim  is in  some\n\nsituations  a question of degree.  In this case we think that\n\nthe district court acted within  its considerable discretion,\n\nWilson, 111 S.  Ct. at  2326, in concluding  that this  count\n      \n\nstated no  facts suggesting  more than simple  negligence and\n\nthat,   since  simple  negligence  is  not  a  constitutional\n\n                             -6-\n\nviolation, the  claim was subject to  dismissal under section\n\n1915(d).2\n\n     Watson's  fourth  count  alleged that  prison  officials\n\nrefused to  deliver several cassette tapes  and compact discs\n\nto him, denying those items as \"non-allowable\" but failing to\n\ngive Watson a \"non-allowable  property sheet,\" and failing as\n\nwell  to notify  Watson that  the items  had  been delivered.\n\nInstead, Watson says,  a corrections officer destroyed  them.\n\nWatson does not complain directly of the decision to withhold\n\nthe property from him,  but rather of the lack  of notice and\n\nthe resulting  destruction of  the property before  he had  a\n\nchange  to have the items sent  back.  In other words, Watson\n\nhas raised an issue of procedural due process.\n\n     The Fourteenth  Amendment says that state  officials may\n\nnot deprive persons of property without \"due process of law.\"\n\nU.S.  Const., art.  XIV.   The  process  due depends  on  the\n\ncircumstances.    Mathews  v.  Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  335\n                                       \n\n(1976).  The  cases distinguish sharply  between deprivations\n\ncaused by  \"random, unauthorized\" conduct of state officials,\n\nand deprivations  caused by conduct \"pursuant  to established\n\nstate  procedure.\"  See Hudson  v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532\n                                         \n\n(1984).    For the  former,  the state  is  not automatically\n\n                    \n\n     2 Conceivably,  in the  remand in connection  with count\none,  Watson could  move for  leave to  replead count  two to\nallege facts amounting to a constitutional violation.   If he\ndid  so, we  assume  the court  would  give this  motion  due\nconsideration.  See Denton, 112 S. Ct. at 1734.\n                          \n\n                             -7-\n\nliable;3  in the latter case there may be liability where the\n\nstate  policy approves or directs the conduct but falls below\n\nconstitutional standards.\n\n     In  this  instance, Watson  does  not  suggest that  the\n\nofficer's conduct reflected a state policy.  His brief states\n\nthat \"a [s]upervisor took it upon his  own\" to throw away the\n\nproperty without giving  Watson notice or allowing him the 30\n\ndays permitted to prisoners to ship back non-allowable items.\n\nThe  complaint itself  asserts  that the  lack  of notice  to\n\nWatson involved  the failure to furnish  him \"a non-allowable\n\nproperty  sheet, which the Department of Corrections normally\n\nissues . . . . \"   The clear inference from these allegations\n\nis that the action was a deviation from, and not a reflection\n\nof,  an established  state procedure.   Under  the precedents\n\ncited,  such a  claim has no  legal basis  in a  section 1983\n\ncase.\n\n     We affirm  the judgment  below in dismissing  counts two\n              \n\nand four  of the  complaint.  As  to count  one, judgment  is\n\nvacated  and the  case  remanded for  further proceedings  in\n       \n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n     So Ordered.\n               \n\n                    \n\n     3The  officer allegedly responsible  for the destruction\nis apparently not a defendant in this case.   Watson does not\nallege that  the state refused to  provide a post-deprivation\nremedy for the alleged  wrong by the officer.   See Hudson v.\n                                                          \nPalmer, 468 U.S. at 533.\n      \n\n                             -8-\n</pre>",
