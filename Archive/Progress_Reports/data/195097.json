Robinson on brief for appellees.\n                  \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   We  have carefully  reviewed the  parties'\n               \n\nbriefs  and  the record  on  appeal.   We  find  no abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  in the  district court  order of  July 15,  1992,\n\nrequiring, as a  condition of proceeding  with her action  in\n\n91-12558-WD, plaintiff Laura Hickey (1)  to deposit $1,000 in\n\nthe Registry of the  Court, and (2) to file a submission with\n\nthe presiding judge  in 91-12558-WD that clarifies  the basis\n\nof Laura Hickey's  claims in her new action  and explains why\n\nthe complaint  is well-grounded in  fact and is  warranted by\n\nexisting  law  or a  good faith  argument for  the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law.\n\n     We  conclude  that,  in  requiring  the  $1,000  deposit\n\npending  the outcome  of the new  action, the  district court\n\njustifiably balanced  Laura's right  of access  to the  court\n\nprocess  with   her  responsibility   to  use  that   process\n\nappropriately.    The  litigation  record  presented  by  the\n\nplaintiffs' previous lawsuit shows that the balance was well-\n\nstruck.    Plaintiffs'  argument  that  this  requirement  is\n\ninappropriate because the defendants were not  the prevailing\n\nparty in  the first lawsuit  is off  the mark.   The district\n\ncourt  ordered  the deposit  because  it determined  that the\n\nplaintiffs  had  abused  the  process  - a  conclusion  amply\n\nsupported by the  record - and not because  it had determined\n\nthat the  defendants were the  prevailing party in  the first\n\nlawsuit.  An order directing Laura to deposit $1,000 into the\n\nCourt's  Registry as a  condition to proceeding  with her new\n\nlawsuit is within the  court's power, warranted by the  facts\n\nof this case,  and not an abuse  of discretion.  See  Kern v.\n                                                          \n\nTXO Prod. Corp.,  738 F.2d 968, 972 (8th  Cir. 1984) (holding\n               \n\nthat  plaintiff  should be  required  to  make a  payment  to\n\ndefendant as  a condition  of maintaining  a second  action).\n\nThe  district  court  gave  sufficient  deference  to Laura's\n\nindigency  by  requiring  a $1,000  deposit  rather  than the\n\n$6,598.50   it  determined   was  warranted.      No  further\n\ndelineation  of  factors  to support  the  $1,000  figure was\n\nrequired.\n\n     Similarly, we conclude that the court  did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in  requiring  the  submission  described  above.\n\nWhile  it  appears  that  the  voluntary  dismissal   without\n\nprejudice  renders inapplicable the doctrines of either claim\n\nor issue  preclusion to  the new  lawsuit, see  National R.R.\n                                                             \n\nPassenger  Corp.  v.  International Assoc.  of  Machinists  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nAerospace  Workers, 915  F.2d 43,  48 (1st  Cir.  1990), this\n                  \n\ncondition,  in effect,  merely  requires  Laura  to  make  an\n\naffirmative and supported showing of  what Fed. R. Civ. P. 11\n\notherwise finds implicit by a party's  signature - i.e., that\n\n\"[t]he signature of  ... [a] party constitutes  a certificate\n\nby the signer ... that to the best of the signer's knowledge,\n\ninformation, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is\n\nwell grounded in fact  and is warranted by existing law  or a\n\ngood  faith  argument  for  the extension,  modification,  or\n\nreversal of existing law.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Finally,  we are not persuaded by plaintiffs' claim that\n\nthey were prejudiced  by the court's alleged  failure to send\n\nthem  a copy of  its February  16, 1989  judgment.   We note,\n\ninitially,  that, insofar as  the plaintiffs claim  that they\n\nwere unaware  of that judgment  until January  1992, that  is\n\nbelied  by the  record.   On March  27, 1989,  the defendants\n\nmoved to  dismiss plaintiffs'  appeals then  pending in  this\n\ncourt  on   the  basis   of  the   February  16th   judgment.\n\nPlaintiffs, themselves,  filed an  opposition to  defendants'\n\nmotion on April  10, 1989.  Moreover, even  assuming that the\n\nplaintiffs did not timely receive  notice of that February 16\n\njudgment,  they were  not  legally  prejudiced  by it.    The\n\nFebruary 16th judgment granted voluntary dismissal\n\n          on condition that, if and when plaintiffs\n          (or either  of them) seek  to refile  any\n          claim asserted  in this  case, defendants\n          will  be  allowed  a  hearing  on   their\n          request for an  order that the plaintiffs\n          pay the  costs and  expenses incurred  by\n          defendants in  the present  action before\n          proceeding with the new action.\n\nA  voluntary dismissal without prejudice which provides for a\n\nfuture hearing  in the event  of a future lawsuit  is neither\n\n\"onerous,\" McGregor v. Board of Commrs. of Palm Beach County,\n                                                            \n\n956  F.2d 1017,  1021 (11th  Cir. 1992); Mortgage  Guar.

Richard Carlyon  Co., 904 F.2d  298, 300  (5th Cir.\n                              \n\n1990),  a severe  circumscription of  plaintiffs'  freedom to\n\nbring a later suit, LeCompte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., 528 F.2d 601,\n                                              \n\n604 (5th Cir.  1976), or \"so  outrageous as to demand  a full\n\n                             -4-\n\nappellate review,\"  Yoffe v.

In any event, since the plaintiffs\n\nappealed,  and  we have  affirmed,  the July  15,  1992 order\n\narising from  the hearing forecast  in the February  16, 1989\n\njudgment, plaintiffs' complaint about that judgment is moot.\n\n     We have considered  plaintiffs' remaining arguments  and\n\nfind them to be without merit.1\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n1.  We note  that, in plaintiffs' previous lawsuit, plaintiff\nMary Ann Hickey represented herself pro se during most of the\nproceedings therein.  This is permissible with respect to her\nown  claims.   It appears,  however, that  Mary Ann  was also\npermitted to represent  her daughter, Laura, who was  at that\ntime, a  minor.  Contra  Cheung v.

In  this,  and   any  future\nproceeding,  Laura must either  be represented by  counsel or\nshe may represent herself, pro  se.

The district court gave sufficient deference to Laura's indigency by requiring a $1,000 deposit rather than the $6,598.50 it determined was warranted.  No further delineation of factors to support the $1,000 figure was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the submission described above.  While it appears that the voluntary dismissal without prejudice renders inapplicable the doctrines of either claim or issue preclusion to the new lawsuit,  see National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. International Assoc. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548684\"><a href=\"/opinion/548684/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-international-association-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 1990), this condition, in effect, merely requires Laura to make an affirmative and supported showing of what Fed.  R. Civ. P. 11 otherwise finds implicit by a party's signature i.e., that \"[t]he signature of ... [a] party constitutes a certificate by the signer ... that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are not persuaded by plaintiffs' claim that they were prejudiced by the court's alleged failure to send them a copy of its February 16, 1989 judgment.  We note, initially, that, insofar as the plaintiffs claim that they were unaware of that judgment until January 1992, that is belied by the record.  On March 27, 1989, the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' appeals then pending in this court on the basis of the February 16th judgment.  Plaintiffs, themselves, filed an opposition to defendants' motion on April 10, 1989.  Moreover, even assuming that the plaintiffs did not timely receive notice of that February 16 judgment, they were not legally prejudiced by it.  The February 16th judgment granted voluntary dismissal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>on condition that, if and when plaintiffs (or either of them) seek to refile any claim asserted in this case, defendants will be allowed a hearing on their request for an order that the plaintiffs pay the costs and expenses incurred by defendants in the present action before proceeding with the new action</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A voluntary dismissal without prejudice which provides for a future hearing in the event of a future lawsuit is neither \"onerous,\"  McGregor v.

In any event, since the plaintiffs appealed, and we have affirmed, the July 15, 1992 order arising from the hearing forecast in the February 16, 1989 judgment, plaintiffs' complaint about that judgment is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered plaintiffs' remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that, in plaintiffs' previous lawsuit, plaintiff Mary Ann Hickey represented herself pro se during most of the proceedings therein.
