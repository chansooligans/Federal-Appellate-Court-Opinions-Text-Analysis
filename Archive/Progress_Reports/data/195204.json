Ana  L. Ocasio Vazquez  (claimant) appeals\n                \n\nfrom a district court judgment  affirming the decision of the\n\nSecretary  of   Health   and  Human   Services  denying   her\n\napplication  for disability benefits.  For the reasons stated\n\nbelow, we affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     Claimant was born on September 25, 1946, and applied for\n\nbenefits  when she  was forty  three years  old.   She has  a\n\nseventh grade education and does not  speak English.  Between\n\n1970 and 1988, she was employed as a sewing machine operator.\n\nIn 1978, she suffered trauma to her left knee and underwent a\n\nleft medial  meniscectomy.  She returned to  work but injured\n\nthe  same knee  in 1982.   Claimant  continued to  work until\n\nMarch 15, 1988,  when pain in her left leg worsened.  She was\n\nhospitalized for several days and, thereafter, did not return\n\nto work.\n\n     On  February 2, 1990, claimant filed her application for\n\nbenefits alleging that she  was disabled by phlebitis  in her\n\nleft  leg,  sinusitis, headaches,  back  pains, and  nerves.1\n\nShe claimed that she could not work because:\n\n     My  leg becomes  swollen and my  two legs  go numb.\n     The  backache and the  headaches are frequent.   At\n     night, I don't sleep much.   Before, I used to turn\n     the  house upside  down  [to  give  it  a  thorough\n     cleaning] but I can't do it anymore.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Phlebitis  is  inflammation  of a  vein.    See Dorland's\n                                                             \nIllustrated  Medical   Dictionary  1279   (27th  ed.   1988).\n                                 \nSinusitis is inflammation of a sinus.  Id. at 1531.\n                                          \n\n                             -2-\n\nThe   Social   Security  Administration   denied   claimant's\n\napplication initially and on reconsideration.\n\n     Claimant obtained a hearing before an Administrative Law\n\nJudge (ALJ)  on March 19,  1991.  She  was represented by  an\n\nattorney.  In addition to the claimant, a medical expert (ME)\n\nand a vocational expert (VE) testified.\n\n     At the hearing, claimant reiterated her claims about her\n\nleg and back conditions, as well as headaches.  She testified\n\nthat her headaches are  relieved by medication, but  that the\n\nrelief is  only temporary.   She also complained of  pain and\n\nnumbness in her upper left shoulder, dizzy spells, and \"teary\n\nand itchy\"  eyes.  With respect to  her physical limitations,\n\nclaimant testified that  she could not sit for  more than one\n\nhalf hour at  a time, that she  could not walk a  distance of\n\nmore than  four or five  houses before pain  in her back  and\n\nlegs caused  her to return  home, and that sometimes  her leg\n\npain was so strong that she had to lie down.2   \n\n     The ME testified that claimant had only a very mild loss\n\nof  movement in  her  knee  and  suffered  from  \"superficial\n\nphlebitis,  which   though   painful   when   occurring,   is\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although claimant testified  that she did not  think that\nshe could work, she  also testified that she had not tried to\nfind a job because:\n\n          I  don't feel capable.  I don't know what\n          kind of work to look for because nowadays\n          one  has  to  have  a  degree  to  get  a\n          comfortable job and I don't have it.\n\n                             -3-\n\ninconsequential.\"3   He  concluded  that  \"in  terms  of  her\n\nfunctioning, there isn't a great degree of limitation.\"  With\n\nrespect to claimant's  back pain, the  ME testified that  her\n\ncondition  \"at no  time is  characterized as  abnormal.\"   He\n\nfound  no  evidence  of  objective  neurological  pain.    In\n\nsummation,  the  ME  testified  that  \"[he  didn't]  see  the\n\nseverity in any of the conditions that [claimant] mentioned,\"\n\neven as a whole, and  that she should try to find a  job that\n\ndid not involve repetitive foot movements.  \n\n     The VE  identified claimant's  former work  as a  sewing\n\nmachine operator as light and  semi-skilled.  The ALJ posed a\n\nhypothetical to the  VE which assumed  that claimant can  sit\n\nfor five  hours in an eight hour day;  can stand for three to\n\nfour   hours  in  the  same  period;   can  lift  ten  pounds\n\nfrequently, and twenty-five pounds occasionally; can pull and\n\npush with her hands, but  not make repetitive leg  movements;\n\nand can bend and squat  occasionally.4  The VE concluded that\n\nclaimant  could not  do her  past  work as  a sewing  machine\n\noperator,  because it  required her  to  sit all  day and  to\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  ME  testified  that  \"superficial  phlebitis  is  an\ninflammation  of the superficial  veins in  the legs  and the\nvaricose veins,  as we commonly  know them are the  ones seen\nthrough the skins, they sometimes swell get reddish and could\nbe very painful, but besides being temporarily uncomfortable,\nit is not a condition that's considered serious.\"  \n\n4.  The hypothetical also assumed that  claimant was somewhat\nlimited in her ability to work at unprotected heights, around\noperating machinery, or in an  environment where she would be\nexposed to extreme changes in temperature.\n\n                             -4-\n\nalternate  her legs frequently.  However, he identified three\n\nother jobs within the clothing industry--garment bagger, spot\n\ncleaner, and garment inspector--that  claimant could perform.\n\nIn these  jobs, the VE  testified, claimant could  change her\n\nposition at  will.  The  VE further  testified that  claimant\n\ncould perform these jobs if she had mild pain.\n\n     The ALJ  found that  the combined  effect of  claimant's\n\nstatus post  left meniscectomy, status post  left superficial\n\nphlebitis,  and  sinusitis are  severe.   He also  found that\n\nclaimant is  unable to perform  her past work.   However, the\n\nALJ  concluded  that  claimant  has  the  residual functional\n\ncapacity  to  perform within  sedentary  to light  exertional\n\ndemands.5    The  AlJ   further  concluded  that   claimant's\n\nallegations of  left leg  and knee pains  do not  disable her\n\nfrom performing sedentary  to light work.   Finally, the  ALJ\n\nruled that, based on the  testimony of the vocational  expert\n\nand application of the Grid, claimant is not disabled at step\n\nfive of the sequential analysis because  there are other jobs\n\nthat she can perform.  \n\n                    \n\n5.  The ALJ went on make  specific findings that claimant has\nthe capacity:\n\n          to perform  the physical  exertion requirements  of\n          work except  for sitting over  five hours, standing\n          and walking over  three to four hours,  lifting and\n          carrying  over 10  pounds frequently and  25 pounds\n          occasionally,  performing  repetitive  actions with\n          her lower extremities  and exposure to  unprotected\n          heights, moving  machinery  or  abrupt  changes  in\n          temperature. \n\n                             -5-\n\n     The  Appeals Council denied review.  An appeal was taken\n\nto  the  district court,  where a  magistrate-judge concluded\n\nthat  the Secretary's decision  was supported  by substantial\n\nevidence.  The district court adopted the magistrate's report\n\nand recommendation.  This appeal followed.\n\n                       MEDICAL HISTORY\n\n     The  medical  record  is well-summarized  in  the  ALJ's\n\nreport, and we  need only provide a brief overview  here.  In\n\nlate February and early  March 1988, claimant saw  doctors at\n\nthe State  Insurance Fund for  pain and swelling in  her left\n\nknee.  On March 21, 1988, claimant was hospitalized for these\n\ncomplaints.  A left leg venogram was negative for thrombosis,\n\nbut  an x-ray indicated joint space narrowing compatible with\n\nosteoarthritis.  Claimant was prescribed an anti-inflammatory\n\nmedication  and discharged on March 25, 1988.  At the time of\n\ndischarge,  she was not experiencing leg discomfort and there\n\nwere no restrictions on her activities.\n\n     After her release from the hospital, claimant  underwent\n\nfurther tests  and her  left leg condition  was diagnosed  as\n\nsuperficial  thrombophlebitis.  She  continued to be  seen by\n\ndoctors at the State Insurance Fund for complaints of pain in\n\nher  left leg.   A  questionnaire completed  by her  personal\n\nphysician,  Dr.  Justimo  Betancourt,  on   March  23,  1990,\n\nindicates that she  had difficulty walking  on her left  leg,\n\nbut had no inflammation.   Dr. Betancourt also reported  that\n\n                             -6-\n\nclaimant  had a history  of maxillary sinusitis  and that she\n\nhad occasional dizzy spells.  \n\n     An internist evaluation  done by Dr. Isabel  Cestero, on\n\nMarch 30,  1990, noted that  claimant complained of  pain and\n\nnumbness in her left leg, as well as swelling if she remained\n\nstanding.  Laboratory  results for the left knee were normal,\n\nbut  a back x-ray  indicated minimal  narrowing of  the lumbo\n\nsacral  spine at  L5-S1.   Tests revealed some  limitation in\n\nmobility in the left knee (0  -  100  out of a possible range\n\nof  0   -  120 ).     The  diagnosis  was  status  post  left\n\nmeniscectomy and status post left superficial phlebitis.\n\n     On  September 21, 1990, Dr. Betancourt reported findings\n\nsimilar to those  he reported on March 23,  1990, although he\n\nalso noted  left leg skin  changes with edema.   On September\n\n28,  1990, an  x-ray  of  claimant's  cervical  spine  showed\n\nstraightening  secondary to muscle spasms, as well as minimal\n\nlevoscoliosis. \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     On  appeal, claimant raises two issues.  First, claimant\n\nargues that  the ALJ failed  to give proper  consideration to\n\nher  subjective  complaints  of   disabling  pain.    Second,\n\nclaimant  contends  that  the  ALJ's  conclusions  about  her\n\nphysical exertional capacity are not supported by substantial\n\nevidence  because they were reached without any assessment of\n\nresidual functional capacity by a physician.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     With  respect to claimant's argument that the ALJ failed\n\nto properly  evaluate her claim  of subjective pain,  we note\n\nthat  although  it   was  considered  and  rejected   by  the\n\nmagistrate, it was not encompassed in claimant's objection to\n\nthe magistrate's report.  It is well-settled in  this circuit\n\nthat  a party  may not  obtain appellate  review of  an issue\n\ndetermined by a magistrate when  the party has failed to file\n\na timely objection  to the magistrate's determination  of the\n\nissue as required by 28 U.S.C.    636(b).  See Thomas v. Arn,\n                                                            \n\n474 U.S. 140, 147-48 (1985); Keating v. Secretary of Health &amp;\n                                                             \n\nHuman  Services,  848 F.2d  271,  273  (1st Cir.  1988)  (per\n               \n\ncuriam); Park  Motor Mart, Inc.  v. Ford Motor Co.,  616 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n603, 605 (1st Cir. 1980).   Accordingly, the issue is waived.\n\n     We  add that even if  we were to  consider the issue, we\n\nwould  disagree.  Claimant was questioned regarding her daily\n\nactivities,   functional   restrictions,    medication,   and\n\nfrequency  and  duration  of  pain  in  conformity  with  the\n\nguidelines set  out in Avery  v. Secretary of Health  &amp; Human\n                                                             \n\nServices,  797 F.2d  19 (1st Cir.  1986).6   In light  of the\n        \n\nlack of medical  evidence to suggest  an objective basis  for\n\n                    \n\n6.  Although  more  thorough   questioning  at  the   hearing\nregarding  claimant's   daily  activities  would   have  been\npreferable,  the   record  included  a   questionnaire  which\nelicited this information from her.  Claimant stated that she\nspent most of the time lying  down, but also stated that  she\ncooked occasionally and that she visited close relatives.\n\n                             -8-\n\ndisabling  pain, the ALJ, who observed claimant's demeanor at\n\nthe hearing, was entitled to make a credibility determination\n\nregarding claimant's  pain, Da Rosa v. Secretary  of Health &amp;\n                                                             \n\nHuman Services, 803 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam),\n              \n\nand  to conclude  that  her  pain did  not  disable her  from\n\nperforming within sedentary to light exertional demands.  See\n                                                             \n\nPerez v. Secretary of Health  &amp; Human Services, 958 F.2d 445,\n                                              \n\n448 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).\n\n     The  ALJ's  finding  that  claimant   has  the  residual\n\nfunctional capacity to do sedentary to light work is slightly\n\nmore  problematic, though we  ultimately conclude that  it is\n\nsupported by substantial  evidence.  It is true  that we have\n\nheld that an  ALJ is not qualified to  interpret \"raw medical\n\ndata\" in functional terms.  See  Perez, 958 F.2d at 446.   We\n                                      \n\nhave   also  stated,  however,  that  the  Secretary  is  not\n\nprecluded   from  rendering   common-sense  judgments   about\n\nfunctional capacity based  on medical findings.\"   Gordils v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of Health &amp; Human  Services, 921 F.2d 327, 329 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1990) (per curiam).      Here,  there  is   no  residual\n\nfunctional capacity analysis by an  expert in the record.  We\n\nfind, however,  that the ALJ could make  a determination that\n\nclaimant was not disabled for  the following reasons.  First,\n\nthe impairments in the record appear to be  \"relatively mild\"\n\nin the  sense that the  reports show few symptoms  that would\n\naffect  ability to  do work.   See  Santiago v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\n                             -9-\n\nHealth  &amp; Human  Services, 944  F.2d 1  (1st Cir.  1991) (per\n                         \n\ncuriam).    Second,  the  ALJ's \"common-sense  judgment\"  was\n\nbolstered by the  testimony of a  medical expert that  \"there\n\nisn't  a great degree of limitation\" on claimant's functional\n\ncapacity, that he \"[did not] see  the severity\" in any of the\n\nconditions she  mentioned, and  that claimant  should try  to\n\nfind a job that did  not require her to make  repetitive foot\n\nmovements.   Finally,  aside from  claimant's allegations  of\n\ndisabling pain,  which we have  held the ALJ was  entitled to\n\nreject, the only other claimed limitation was an inability to\n\nsit or walk for an extended period of time.  The hypothetical\n\nposed to the VE by the ALJ  assumed the truth of this claimed\n\nlimitation, and the VE identified  jobs that would permit her\n\nto alternate positions at will.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                             -10-\n",

Ocasio Vazquez (claimant) appeals from a district court judgment affirming the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denying her application for disability benefits.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant was born on September 25, 1946, and applied for benefits when she was forty three years old.  She has a seventh grade education and does not speak English.  Between 1970 and 1988, she was employed as a sewing machine operator.  In 1978, she suffered trauma to her left knee and underwent a left medial meniscectomy.  She returned to work but injured the same knee in 1982.  Claimant continued to work until March 15, 1988, when pain in her left leg worsened.  She was hospitalized for several days and, thereafter, did not return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1990, claimant filed her application for benefits alleging that she was disabled by phlebitis in her left leg, sinusitis, headaches, back pains, and nerves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She claimed that she could not work because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My leg becomes swollen and my two legs go numb.  The backache and the headaches are frequent.  At night, I don't sleep much.  Before, I used to turn the house upside down [to give it a thorough cleaning] but I can't do it anymore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Social Security Administration denied claimant's application initially and on reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant obtained a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on March 19, 1991.  She was represented by an attorney.  In addition to the claimant, a medical expert (ME) and a vocational expert (VE) testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, claimant reiterated her claims about her leg and back conditions, as well as headaches.  She testified that her headaches are relieved by medication, but that the relief is only temporary.  She also complained of pain and numbness in her upper left shoulder, dizzy spells, and \"teary and itchy\" eyes.  With respect to her physical limitations, claimant testified that she could not sit for more than one half hour at a time, that she could not walk a distance of more than four or five houses before pain in her back and legs caused her to return home, and that sometimes her leg pain was so strong that she had to lie down.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ME testified that claimant had only a very mild loss of movement in her knee and suffered from \"superficial phlebitis, which though painful when occurring, is inconsequential.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He concluded that \"in terms of her functioning, there isn't a great degree of limitation.\"  With respect to claimant's back pain, the ME testified that her condition \"at no time is characterized as abnormal.\"  He found no evidence of objective neurological pain.  In summation, the ME testified that \"[he didn't] see the severity in any of the conditions that [claimant] mentioned,\" even as a whole, and that she should try to find a job that did not involve repetitive foot movements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE identified claimant's former work as a sewing machine operator as light and semi-skilled.  The ALJ posed a hypothetical to the VE which assumed that claimant can sit for five hours in an eight hour day;  can stand for three to four hours in the same period;  can lift ten pounds frequently, and twenty-five pounds occasionally;  can pull and push with her hands, but not make repetitive leg movements;  and can bend and squat occasionally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The VE concluded that claimant could not do her past work as a sewing machine operator, because it required her to sit all day and to alternate her legs frequently.  However, he identified three other jobs within the clothing industry-garment bagger, spot cleaner, and garment inspector-that claimant could perform.  In these jobs, the VE testified, claimant could change her position at will.  The VE further testified that claimant could perform these jobs if she had mild pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found that the combined effect of claimant's status post left meniscectomy, status post left superficial phlebitis, and sinusitis are severe.  He also found that claimant is unable to perform her past work.  However, the ALJ concluded that claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform within sedentary to light exertional demands.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The AlJ further concluded that claimant's allegations of left leg and knee pains do not disable her from performing sedentary to light work.  Finally, the ALJ ruled that, based on the testimony of the vocational expert and application of the Grid, claimant is not disabled at step five of the sequential analysis because there are other jobs that she can perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Council denied review.  An appeal was taken to the district court, where a magistrate-judge concluded that the Secretary's decision was supported by substantial evidence.  The district court adopted the magistrate's report and recommendation.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>MEDICAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical record is well-summarized in the ALJ's report, and we need only provide a brief overview here.  In late February and early March 1988, claimant saw doctors at the State Insurance Fund for pain and swelling in her left knee.  On March 21, 1988, claimant was hospitalized for these complaints.  A left leg venogram was negative for thrombosis, but an x-ray indicated joint space narrowing compatible with osteoarthritis.  Claimant was prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication and discharged on March 25, 1988.  At the time of discharge, she was not experiencing leg discomfort and there were no restrictions on her activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her release from the hospital, claimant underwent further tests and her left leg condition was diagnosed as superficial thrombophlebitis.  She continued to be seen by doctors at the State Insurance Fund for complaints of pain in her left leg.  A questionnaire completed by her personal physician, Dr. Justimo Betancourt, on March 23, 1990, indicates that she had difficulty walking on her left leg, but had no inflammation.  Dr. Betancourt also reported that claimant had a history of maxillary sinusitis and that she had occasional dizzy spells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An internist evaluation done by Dr. Isabel Cestero, on March 30, 1990, noted that claimant complained of pain and numbness in her left leg, as well as swelling if she remained standing.  Laboratory results for the left knee were normal, but a back x-ray indicated minimal narrowing of the lumbo sacral spine at L5-S1. Tests revealed some limitation in mobility in the left knee (0?-100? out of a possible range of 0?-120?).  The diagnosis was status post left meniscectomy and status post left superficial phlebitis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 21, 1990, Dr. Betancourt reported findings similar to those he reported on March 23, 1990, although he also noted left leg skin changes with edema.  On September 28, 1990, an x-ray of claimant's cervical spine showed straightening secondary to muscle spasms, as well as minimal levoscoliosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant raises two issues.  First, claimant argues that the ALJ failed to give proper consideration to her subjective complaints of disabling pain.  Second, claimant contends that the ALJ's conclusions about her physical exertional capacity are not supported by substantial evidence because they were reached without any assessment of residual functional capacity by a physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to claimant's argument that the ALJ failed to properly evaluate her claim of subjective pain, we note that although it was considered and rejected by the magistrate, it was not encompassed in claimant's objection to the magistrate's report.  It is well-settled in this circuit that a party may not obtain appellate review of an issue determined by a magistrate when the party has failed to file a timely objection to the magistrate's determination of the issue as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b).   See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 147-48 (1985);   Keating v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 848 F.2d 271, 273 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam);   Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir. 1980).  Accordingly, the issue is waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that even if we were to consider the issue, we would disagree.  Claimant was questioned regarding her daily activities, functional restrictions, medication, and frequency and duration of pain in conformity with the guidelines set out in  Avery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In light of the lack of medical evidence to suggest an objective basis for disabling pain, the ALJ, who observed claimant's demeanor at the hearing, was entitled to make a credibility determination regarding claimant's pain,  Da Rosa v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 803 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam), and to conclude that her pain did not disable her from performing within sedentary to light exertional demands.   See Perez v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 958 F.2d 445, 448 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ's finding that claimant has the residual functional capacity to do sedentary to light work is slightly more problematic, though we ultimately conclude that it is supported by substantial evidence.  It is true that we have held that an ALJ is not qualified to interpret \"raw medical data\" in functional terms.   See Perez, 958 F.2d at 446.  We have also stated, however, that the Secretary is not precluded from rendering common-sense judgments about functional capacity based on medical findings.\"  Gordils v.  Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 921 F.2d 327, 329 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam).  Here, there is no residual functional capacity analysis by an expert in the record.  We find, however, that the ALJ could make a determination that claimant was not disabled for the following reasons.  First, the impairments in the record appear to be \"relatively mild\" in the sense that the reports show few symptoms that would affect ability to do work.   See Santiago v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, 944 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).  Second, the ALJ's \"common-sense judgment\" was bolstered by the testimony of a medical expert that \"there isn't a great degree of limitation\" on claimant's functional capacity, that he \"[did not] see the severity\" in any of the conditions she mentioned, and that claimant should try to find a job that did not require her to make repetitive foot movements.  Finally, aside from claimant's allegations of disabling pain, which we have held the ALJ was entitled to reject, the only other claimed limitation was an inability to sit or walk for an extended period of time.  The hypothetical posed to the VE by the ALJ assumed the truth of this claimed limitation, and the VE identified jobs that would permit her to alternate positions at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein.

Claimant was questioned regarding her daily activities, functional restrictions, medication, and frequency and duration of pain in conformity with the guidelines set out in  Avery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In light of the lack of medical evidence to suggest an objective basis for disabling pain, the ALJ, who observed claimant's demeanor at the hearing, was entitled to make a credibility determination regarding claimant's pain,  Da Rosa v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477961\"><a href=\"/opinion/477961/15-socsecrepser-223-unemplinsrep-cch-17067-raymond-r-da-rosa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam), and to conclude that her pain did not disable her from performing within sedentary to light exertional demands.   See Perez v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579197\"><a href=\"/opinion/579197/ramonita-cintron-perez-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 448 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ's finding that claimant has the residual functional capacity to do sedentary to light work is slightly more problematic, though we ultimately conclude that it is supported by substantial evidence.  It is true that we have held that an ALJ is not qualified to interpret \"raw medical data\" in functional terms.   See Perez, 958 F.2d at 446.  We have also stated, however, that the Secretary is not precluded from rendering common-sense judgments about functional capacity based on medical findings.\"  Gordils v.  Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553161\"><a href=\"/opinion/553161/32-socsecrepser-101-unemplinsrep-cch-15802a-jose-l-gordils-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 329 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam).  Here, there is no residual functional capacity analysis by an expert in the record.  We find, however, that the ALJ could make a determination that claimant was not disabled for the following reasons.  First, the impairments in the record appear to be \"relatively mild\" in the sense that the reports show few symptoms that would affect ability to do work.   See Santiago v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567917\"><a href=\"/opinion/567917/35-socsecrepser-4-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16272a-luz-m-santiago-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).  Second, the ALJ's \"common-sense judgment\" was bolstered by the testimony of a medical expert that \"there isn't a great degree of limitation\" on claimant's functional capacity, that he \"[did not] see the severity\" in any of the conditions she mentioned, and that claimant should try to find a job that did not require her to make repetitive foot movements.  Finally, aside from claimant's allegations of disabling pain, which we have held the ALJ was entitled to reject, the only other claimed limitation was an inability to sit or walk for an extended period of time.  The hypothetical posed to the VE by the ALJ assumed the truth of this claimed limitation, and the VE identified jobs that would permit her to alternate positions at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein.
