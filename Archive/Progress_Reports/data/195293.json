Plaintiff/appellant Fermin  Alvarez\n                     \n\nSilva appeals  from  a July  16,  1993 district  court  order\n\ndenying his  second motion for  reconsideration following the\n\ncourt's  sua  sponte  dismissal  of  his  case  for  lack  of\n                    \n\nprosecution  pursuant  to Fed.  R. Civ.  P.  41(b).   For the\n\nreasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          On August 6, 1991,  plaintiff, a resident of Puerto\n\nRico,  filed  a  complaint  alleging a  claim  for  injurious\n\nfalsehood against  defendant Isaac Rudman, a  resident of the\n\nDominican Republic.   On  June 29, 1992,  the district  court\n\nissued an  order to show  cause why  the case  should not  be\n\ndismissed  for  lack  of  prosecution.    In  the  order, the\n\ndistrict court stated that \"almost eleven months have elapsed\n\nsince  the complaint  was  filed; but  plaintiff has  not yet\n\nserved  the  defendant.\"   Plaintiff  responded  by filing  a\n\nmotion  requesting until July  31, 1992 to  effect service of\n\nprocess.  Plaintiff  stated in the motion that  if he did not\n\nserve the defendant  by the  end of July,  he would move  for\n\nvoluntary dismissal of the case.    \n\n          The  additional  requested   time  lapsed   without\n\nservice  of  process.1   Thereafter,  instead  of moving  for\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiff  explains his  failure to  complete  service of\nprocess during the  first year  by stating  that his  process\nserver  went  to Santa  Domingo,  Dominican  Republic on  two\noccasions  to  attempt  personal  service.    Plaintiff  also\nstates:    \"In  several   other  occasions  [sic],  plaintiff\n\n                             -2-\n\nvoluntary  dismissal,  defendant  requested authorization  to\n\nserve  process  by publication.    On  October  9, 1992,  the\n\ndistrict  court issued a second  order to show  cause why the\n\ncase should not  be dismissed  for lack of  prosecution.   In\n\nresponse,  plaintiff  brought  to the  court's  attention his\n\npending motion to serve process by publication, and the court\n\nallowed  this motion.  On November 18, 1992, the court issued\n\na summons by edict.   Over two months  later, on January  29,\n\n1993,  the edict  was  finally published  in  a Puerto  Rican\n\nnewspaper.2  Following publication,  plaintiff sent a copy of\n\nthe  complaint and edict  by certified mail  to the defendant\n\nand received a  signed, return receipt dated  April 12, 1993.\n\nOn May 7, 1993, plaintiff moved for entry of default.  On May\n\n10, 1993, the district  court dismissed the case for  lack of\n\nprosecution pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  The same day,\n\nthe clerk entered default against the defendant.\n\n          On  May  18, 1993,  plaintiff  filed  a motion  for\n\nreconsideration of  the dismissal  order.  After  judgment on\n\nthe  dismissal order  was entered  on the  docket on  May 21,\n\n                    \n\nfollowed rumors that the defendant would fly into Puerto Rico\nin other non-related matters.  Such rumors proved unfounded.\"\n\n2.  According to the plaintiff,  the delay in publication was\ncaused  by the failure of the clerk's  office to mail him the\nedict.  Plaintiff  alleges that although he  submitted a form\nedict to the clerk's office on or about  October 31, 1992, he\ndid not learn that the edict had been issued until  the first\nweek in January 1993 when he instructed his secretary to call\nthe clerk's office.\n\n                             -3-\n\n1993,  plaintiff  renewed his  motion for  reconsideration on\n\nJune  1, 1993.  The  district court entered  an order denying\n\nthe motion for reconsideration on June  24, 1993.  On July 2,\n\n1993,  plaintiff filed  a second motion  for reconsideration.\n\nThis motion was denied by order entered on July 20, 1993 when\n\nthe court  \"[f]or the third  and final  time\" reiterated  its\n\ndismissal order.   Plaintiff  filed his  notice of appeal  on\n\nJuly 29, 1993.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Dismissal for failure to prosecute is a significant\n\nsanction  but where a plaintiff is truly dilatory, the choice\n\nof sanction is a matter within the discretion of the district\n\ncourt and is reviewed under an abuse of discretion  standard.\n\nIn this realm, claims of \"abuse of discretion typically `have\n\nnot received a sympathetic  ear from us.'\"  Figueroa  Ruiz v.\n                                                          \n\nAlegria,  896 F.2d 645, 647  (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Damiani\n                                                             \n\nv. Rhode Island Hospital, 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n                        \n\n          Almost  two  years   elapsed  from  the   time  the\n\ncomplaint was filed to the point when the case was dismissed.\n\nDuring that  time, plaintiff  had done nothing  except effect\n\nservice and then, belatedly, filed a motion for default.  The\n\nfirst  year was  marked by unexplained  delays in  seeking to\n\naffect service.   Even  the second  year presented  lapses of\n\ndiligence.  In particular:\n\n                             -4-\n\n          First,  plaintiff   apparently  delayed  publishing\n\nnotice  for over two  months after notice  by publication was\n\napproved by the  district court.  Although  counsel says that\n\nhe did not  know of the  entry of the court's  order, counsel\n\nhas a duty after submitting a request to the court to monitor\n\nthe docket.\n\n          Second,  although notice  was published  on January\n\n29, 1993, calling upon the defendant to answer within 30 days\n\nfrom the date of  publication and warning that default  could\n\notherwise occur,  there is no indication  that plaintiff took\n\nfurther steps to prosecute  the case until May.   The default\n\nmotion  was filed more or less  at the time that the district\n\ncourt determined to dismiss the case.\n\n          We agree that the district court may well have been\n\nunaware of the belated  default motion at the time  the court\n\ndismissed  the case for want of prosecution.  But the court's\n\norder  on reconsideration made  clear that the  court did not\n\nregard  the belated default motion as a timely effort and did\n\nnot  think that  the belated  motion justified  retaining the\n\ncase on its docket.\n\n          We think that the overall progress of this case has\n\nbeen marked  by a  lack  of serious  intent.   In  a time  of\n\ncrowded dockets  and urgent  matters, the kind  of on-and-off\n\nagain efforts  exhibited by plaintiff  in this  case are  not\n\nappropriate and need  not be tolerated.   The district  court\n\n                             -5-\n\nwas lenient at the outset but  eventually its patience became\n\nexhausted.   We do  not regard  its decision as  an abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\n                        \n\n                             -6-\n",

In particular:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiff apparently delayed publishing notice for over two months after notice by publication was approved by the district court.  Although counsel says that he did not know of the entry of the court's order, counsel has a duty after submitting a request to the court to monitor the docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although notice was published on January 29, 1993, calling upon the defendant to answer within 30 days from the date of publication and warning that default could otherwise occur, there is no indication that plaintiff took further steps to prosecute the case until May.  The default motion was filed more or less at the time that the district court determined to dismiss the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the district court may well have been unaware of the belated default motion at the time the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution.  But the court's order on reconsideration made clear that the court did not regard the belated default motion as a timely effort and did not think that the belated motion justified retaining the case on its docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the overall progress of this case has been marked by a lack of serious intent.  In a time of crowded dockets and urgent matters, the kind of on-and-off again efforts exhibited by plaintiff in this case are not appropriate and need not be tolerated.  The district court was lenient at the outset but eventually its patience became exhausted.  We do not regard its decision as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See 1st Cir.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff explains his failure to complete service of process during the first year by stating that his process server went to Santa Domingo, Dominican Republic on two occasions to attempt personal service.  Plaintiff also states:  \"In several other occasions [sic], plaintiff followed rumors that the defendant would fly into Puerto Rico in other non- related matters.  Such rumors proved unfounded.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> According to the plaintiff, the delay in publication was caused by the failure of the clerk's office to mail him the edict.  Plaintiff alleges that although he submitted a form edict to the clerk's office on or about October 31, 1992, he did not learn that the edict had been issued until the first week in January 1993 when he instructed his secretary to call the clerk's office</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
