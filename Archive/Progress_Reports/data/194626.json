The sole question  on this\n                              \n\nappeal  is  whether  the   Narragansett  Indian  Tribe   has\n\nsovereign  immunity  from claims  against  it  for abuse  of\n\nprocess  and slander of title.   We have  recently held that\n\nthe  Tribe  does possess  sovereign  immunity.   Maynard  v.\n                                                        \n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, No. 92-2106, slip. op. at  4 (1st\n                         \n\nCir. January 27, 1993).   And, that decision requires  us to\n\nreverse a default judgment entered against the Tribe.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          On December 6, 1990, the Narragansett Indian Tribe\n\nbrought a lawsuit in Rhode Island federal court against Paul\n\nGuilbert, an adjacent landowner.  The Tribe alleged that  it\n\nheld title to  Guilbert's property, and it  sought to enjoin\n\nGuilbert's planned  sale of that  property.  The  Tribe also\n\nfiled  a  lis pendens  (or  notice  of  pendency)  with  the\n\nCharlestown, Rhode  Island,  Land Evidence  Records  Office.\n\nThat  filing effectively  clouded  Guilbert's  title to  the\n\nproperty and frustrated  his efforts to  sell it.   Guilbert\n\nfiled an answer to the federal court complaint.  That answer\n\nincluded counterclaims  for abuse of process  and slander of\n\ntitle.  \n\n          The  district court issued a temporary restraining\n\norder,  prohibiting  the  sale,  but, after  a  hearing,  it\n\nvacated  the  TRO  and  denied  the  Tribe's  motion  for  a\n\npreliminary injunction.   Thereafter, counsel for  the Tribe\n\nmoved  to withdraw  from  the case  because  the Tribe  \"has\n\ninsisted  upon a  course  of action  that counsel  considers\n\nimprudent.\"    The  district  court granted  the  motion  to\n\nwithdraw.    It  gave the  Tribe  one  month  to secure  new\n\ncounsel.   Five  months  later, the  Tribe  had not  secured\n\ncounsel.  Guilbert  then  asked  the court  to  dismiss  the\n\nTribe's  claims,  to vacate  the  lis  pendens  in the  land\n\noffice, and to enter a default judgment against the Tribe on\n\nGuilbert's   counterclaims.    The  district  court  granted\n\nGuilbert's motions and, after a hearing on damages (at which\n\nthe  Tribe was  represented  by new  counsel), it  entered a\n\ndefault judgment against the  Tribe for about $50,000 (which\n\nrepresented  lost profit  on  a frustrated  land sale,  some\n\nfinancing costs  related to that failed sale, and legal fees\n\nincurred in defending against the Tribe's  suit).  The Tribe\n\nappeals  the default judgment.  It claims that its sovereign\n\nimmunity renders the default judgment void.\n\n                             II\n\n                    The Default Judgment\n                                        \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          Our  recent  decision in  Maynard  v. Narragansett\n                                                            \n\nIndian  Tribe,  No. 92-2106  (1st  Cir.  January 27,  1993),\n             \n\ndetermines the outcome of  this appeal.  We there  held that\n\nthe  Narragansett Indian Tribe possesses sovereign immunity,\n\ndespite  Congress's  enactment of  the  Rhode  Island Indian\n\nClaims  Settlement Act.  Id. at 3 (explaining that the Rhode\n                           \n\nIsland Indian  Claims Settlement Act  subjected the  Tribe's\n\nlands,  but not the Tribe itself, \"to the civil and criminal\n     \n\nlaws and  jurisdiction of  the State  of  Rhode Island,\"  25\n\nU.S.C.    1708).  Controlling case law also makes clear that\n\nthe  Tribe, by  filing its  suit  against Guilbert,  did not\n\nwaive  its  immunity   in  respect  to  the   counterclaims.\n\nOklahoma Tax Comm'n v.

Consequently, the district court\n\nlacked  jurisdiction  over  Guilbert's  counterclaims,  see,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., J.C.  Driskill, Inc. v.

See, e.g., Mattingly  v.\n                                                        \n\nUnited States, 939 F.2d 816, 818-19 (9th Cir. 1991) (Federal\n             \n\nRules  of Civil  Procedure  waive  the Federal  Government's\n\nsovereign  immunity  from  Rule 11  sanctions);  Adamson  v.\n                                                        \n\nBowen, 855 F.2d  668, 670-71 (10th Cir.  1988) (Equal Access\n     \n\nto  Justice  Act,  28   U.S.C.     2412(b),  waives  Federal\n\nGovernment's sovereign  immunity  from Rule  11  sanctions);\n\nUnited States v.
