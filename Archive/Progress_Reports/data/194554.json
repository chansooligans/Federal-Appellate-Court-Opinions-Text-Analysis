Petitioner, Robert\n                                            \n\nA. Whittemore,  appeals from  the denial of  his second  petition\n\nunder  28  U.S.C.   2255 to  set  aside,  vacate  or correct  his\n\nsentence.  The district court dismissed the petition as an \"abuse\n\nof the writ\".  We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In June 1988,  Whittemore was convicted of one count of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute  cocaine, and two\n\ncounts of knowingly and  intentionally distributing a quantity of\n\ncocaine.  At  trial the prosecution  showed that Whittemore  sold\n\nTyrone  Gray, a  government informant,  an  ounce of  cocaine for\n\n$1,500  on  one occasion,  and  two  kilograms worth  $72,000  on\n\nanother occasion.   The  prosecution also showed  that Whittemore\n\nconspired with Gray  and a  woman named Lisa  Obremski to  obtain\n\ncocaine in Florida and distribute it in Maine.\n\n          Following  his  conviction, Whittemore  entered  into a\n\ncooperation agreement with the government in which  he waived the\n\nright of direct appeal of his conviction.  The government in turn\n\ngave Whittemore \"use immunity\" for his cooperative statements and\n\nagreed  to  notify   the  sentencing  court  of  the   extent  of\n\nWhittemore's cooperation.  Thereafter, in August 1988, Whittemore\n\nwas sentenced to imprisonment  for 15 years on all  three counts,\n\nto  be served concurrently, and 10 years of supervised release on\n\nthe two counts of distribution, to run concurrently.\n\n          On  April 25,  1991, Whittemore  wrote to  the district\n\ncourt,  requesting the court to  issue an order  stating that his\n\nsentence was subject to parole.  The court treated the letter  as\n\na motion to correct  a sentence under Rule  35(a) of the  Federal\n\nRules of Criminal  Procedure.   The court held  that the  charges\n\nunder  which Whittemore was  convicted were subject  to the Anti-\n\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986 and therefore did not permit parole.  \n\n          On August 19, 1991,  Whittemore filed pro se  his first\n                                                      \n\n 2255  petition.  In this first petition, Whittemore again raised\n\nthe  issue  of  whether   he  was  appropriately  precluded  from\n\nconsideration for parole by the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse\n\nAct of 1986.  On  October 17, 1991, the district court  once more\n\nfound  that Whittemore's  conviction was  clearly subject  to the\n\nnon-parolable provisions  of the  Anti-Drug Abuse Act  and denied\n\nhis petition without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          On November 12, 1991, Whittemore filed, again pro se, a\n                                                              \n\nsecond     2255 petition.    This time,  Whittemore  raised three\n\nissues  as grounds  to vacate  or correct  his sentence.   First,\n\nWhittemore claimed that Tyrone Gray  gave false testimony for the\n\nprosecution  at Whittemore's  trial,  thereby causing  him to  be\n\nconvicted.   Second,  he claimed  that Lisa  Obremski gave  false\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\ntestimony  at  his   sentencing  hearing,  thereby   causing  the\n\nsentencing  judge  to  impose  a  longer  term  of  imprisonment.\n\nFinally,  Whittemore  claimed  that  he was  entitled  to  credit\n\nagainst his sentence for time served prior to his conviction.\n\n          On December  3, 1991,  the government moved  to dismiss\n\nWhittemore's second  petition on the ground,  among other things,\n\nthat Whittemore  alleged claims  in the  petition which he  could\n\nhave  asserted in  the earlier  petition.   On December  7, 1991,\n\nWhittemore  responded to the government's motion.  In a letter to\n\nthe court,  Whittemore explained  why his second  petition should\n\nnot be dismissed.  Whittemore wrote in part:\n\n          I did  not know  that when  I filed  my first  motion I\n          should  have put  these other  points in  as well.   My\n          first  motion was done by  a friend that  worked in the\n          law  library.   Had I  understood this their  [sic] are\n          some other points I would have made on this last one.\n\n          On  January  15,   1992,  the  district   court  denied\n\nWhittemore's second petition without an evidentiary hearing.  The\n\ncourt found that the government had carried its burden of showing\n\nthat Whittemore had abused the writ of habeas  corpus.  The court\n\nalso determined that Whittemore  had failed to show  that failure\n\nto entertain his second petition would result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice.  As to Whittemore's claim that he was entitled to credit\n\nfor time served prior to his conviction, the court concluded that\n\nWhittemore  had not  exhausted  his  administrative  remedies  by\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nfailing  to pursue his claim with the  Bureau of Prisons.  In any\n\nevent, the court  reasoned, even if Whittemore had  exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, he  would not be entitled  to credit for\n\ntime served because he was out on bail and not incarcerated prior\n\nto his conviction.\n\n          On appeal, Whittemore, now represented by  counsel, has\n\nabandoned his claim  that he  is entitled to  credit against  his\n\nsentence  for time served  prior to conviction.   Whittemore also\n\ndoes  not  challenge  on  appeal  the  court's  finding  that  no\n\nfundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to\n\nentertain  the claims in the  second   2255  petition.1  Instead,\n\nWhittemore presents  three main  arguments: 1) that  the district\n\ncourt erred in not giving him notice that his second petition was\n\nsubject to  dismissal for abuse of the writ; 2) that the abuse of\n\nthe writ  standard  is  inapplicable  because his  first  pro  se\n                                                                 \n\npetition  \"was filed  out of  ignorance\" and,  therefore  \"had no\n\n                       \n\n   1In responding to the district court's finding that no\n   miscarriage of justice would result from denying his second\n   petition, Whittemore writes in his brief on appeal: \"It is\n   not Mr. Whittemore's purpose within the context of this\n   appeal to challenge the district court `miscarriage of\n   justice' analysis.\"  Appellant's Brief at 8-9.  Accordingly,\n   we need not address in detail the court's miscarriage of\n   justice analysis. It suffices to say that we would agree\n   with the district court's conclusion that, under McCleskey\n                                                             \n   v. Zant, 111 S.Ct. 1454 (1991), no miscarriage of justice\n          \n   would result from the denial of Whittemore's second\n   petition.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nsubstantive meaning\"; and 3) that, even  if the abuse of the writ\n\nanalysis is applicable to the second petition, he did satisfy the\n\nburden to show  cause for his failure to raise  his claims in the\n\nearlier  2255 petition.\n\n                               II.\n\n          The   district  court  correctly  determined  that  the\n\nquestion  of whether a petitioner  has abused the  writ of habeas\n\ncorpus is governed by  McCleskey v. Zant, 111 S.Ct.  1454 (1991).\n                                        \n\nIn McCleskey, the Supreme Court held that \"a petitioner can abuse\n            \n\nthe writ  by raising  a claim  in a subsequent  petition that  he\n\ncould have raised in the first, regardless of whether the failure\n\nto  raise it  earlier stemmed from  deliberate choice.\"  Id., 111\n                                                            \n\nS.Ct. at  1468.  The burden  is on the government  to first plead\n\nabuse of the  writ. Id. at 1470.   The government satisfies  this\n                       \n\nburden \"if, with clarity and particularity, it notes petitioner's\n\nprior  writ history, identifies  the claims  that appear  for the\n\nfirst time, and alleges that petitioner has abused the writ.\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\n          The burden to  disprove abuse of the writ  then becomes\n\npetitioner's. Id.   In order  to satisfy this  burden, petitioner\n                 \n\nmust  show cause for failing to raise earlier the claim presented\n\nin the subsequent petition.  Id.  To show cause,  petitioner must\n                                \n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nshow  that  some   external  impediment,  such   as  governmental\n\ninterference or  the reasonable unavailability of  the factual or\n\nlegal  basis for a claim,  prevented the claim  from being raised\n\nearlier.  Id.  at 1472.   If  petitioner  cannot show  cause \"the\n             \n\nfailure to raise the claim in an earlier petition may nonetheless\n\nbe  excused if he or she can  show that a fundamental miscarriage\n\nof justice would result  from a failure to entertain  the claim.\"\n\nId. at 1470.\n   \n\n                                A.\n\n          As a  preliminary matter,  Whittemore argues  on appeal\n\nthat the district court erred  in not giving him notice  that his\n\nsecond petition was subject  to dismissal.  Whittemore's argument\n\ngoes  as follows: Rule 9(b)  of the Rules  Governing Section 2255\n\nProceedings provides that a second or successive  2255 motion may\n\nbe  dismissed if  the  court finds  that petitioner's  failure to\n\nassert  grounds  in  an  earlier petition  constituted  abuse  of\n\nprocess.  Following Rule 9(b) in the appendix of forms is a model\n\nform to  be  used in   2255 petitions.   This  form \"was  clearly\n\ndrafted for the  benefit of the  pro se litigant.\"   The form  is\n                                       \n\ndesigned to give the  pro se petitioner specific notice  that the\n                            \n\npetition is subject to dismissal.  Whittemore, at the time of the\n\nfiling of his second   2255 petition, was a pro  se litigant. The\n                                                   \n\ndistrict  court never  sent  the Rule  9(b)  form to  Whittemore.\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nTherefore, Whittemore  argues,  this  court  should  reverse  the\n\ndistrict court's order dismissing his second petition.\n\n          We find  this argument unconvincing.   The fact  of the\n\nmatter is Whittemore did have notice that his second petition was\n\nsubject to dismissal.  The form which he used to file the first  \n\n2255 petition contained the warning: \"CAUTION: If you fail to set\n\nforth  all ground[s]  in  this motion,  you  may be  barred  from\n\npresenting  additional grounds  at a  later date.\"   Furthermore,\n\nWhittemore  actually responded  to  the  government's  motion  to\n\ndismiss  his second  petition.   In  a  letter to  the court,  he\n\nexplained that at the time he filed his first petition he did not\n\nknow that he  was supposed to present all of  his claims at once.\n\nFinally, we have never held in this circuit that failure  to give\n\nspecific notice to a  petitioner is alone grounds to  reverse the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a   2255  petition for abuse of the\n\nwrit, especially when,  as here, the petitioner had actual notice\n\nthat  the petition was  subject to  dismissal. See  McLaughlin v.\n                                                                 \n\nGabriel,  726 F.2d 7,  10 (1st Cir. 1984)  (pleading abuse of the\n       \n\nwrit  puts petitioner on notice to show cause why claim raised in\n\nsubsequent petition was not brought in an earlier petition).\n\n                                B.\n\n          Whittemore next argues that  the McCleskey abuse of the\n                                                    \n\nwrit  standard  should not  be  applied  to his  second  petition\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nbecause  his  first petition  \"was filed  out of  ignorance\" and,\n\ntherefore  \"had  no substantive  meaning.\"      As we  understand\n\nWhittemore's argument, the first    2255 petition raised an issue\n\nwhich  the court  had  already  denied  in Whittemore's  Rule  35\n\nmotion; namely the issue  of whether his sentence was  subject to\n\nparole.   The  district  court,  in  denying  the  first     2255\n\npetition,  did not rule  on the merits  of the  claim, since that\n\nclaim had already been decided in the Rule 35 motion.  Therefore,\n\nWhittemore  argues, for  purposes of  determining whether  he has\n\nabused the writ, the first   2255 petition should  not count, and\n\nthe second petition should in effect be considered the first.\n\n          Whittemore  has  not cited  any  case  to support  this\n\nrather ingenious proposition.   In  any event, the  point of  the\n\ndoctrine of abuse  of the writ, as explained in McCleskey, is not\n                                                         \n\nwhat  petitioner alleges in the first   2255 petition, but rather\n\nwhat  petition does not allege in the first petition.  McCleskey,\n                                                                \n\n111  S.Ct. at  1470.   Thus, it  is not  relevant that  the claim\n\nWhittemore made in the  first petition was one which  had already\n\nbeen decided by  the court.   The point is  that in bringing  the\n\nfirst petition  Whittemore was  obligated to present  all of  the\n\nclaims which he now raises in the second petition.\n\n                                C.\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\n          Whittemore's  remaining contention is that, even if the\n\nabuse  of the writ analysis is applicable to his second petition,\n\nhe did satisfy the burden to  show cause for his failure to raise\n\nhis  claims   in  the  earlier   2255   petition.    Specifically\n\nWhittemore explains that the  issues raised in the second    2255\n\nmotion were not raised in the  first   2255 motion because he did\n\nnot have the funds to hire an attorney, he was not represented by\n\ncounsel at the time  of both motions, and he  was unfamiliar with\n\nthe law.  \n\n          In  Andiarena v. U.S., 967 F.2d 715 (1st Cir. 1992), we\n                               \n\nconsidered the pro se appeal  of a petitioner from the  denial of\n                     \n\nhis second   2255 petition by  the district court.  As an attempt\n\nto establish cause  for failure to  raise his claims  in a  prior\n\npetition,  petitioner explained  that at  the time  he filed  his\n\nfirst petition he did  not have access to the transcripts  of his\n\ntrial.   We  held petitioner's  explanation insufficient  to show\n\ncause. Andiarena, 967 F.2d  at 718.  We  reasoned that under  the\n                \n\nstandard  established in  McCleskey,  \"to  establish `cause'  for\n                                   \n\nfailure to raise a claim in a prior petition, one  must show that\n\nsome external impediment, such  as government interference or the\n\nreasonable unavailability  of the factual  and legal basis  for a\n\nclaim prevented it from being raised earlier.\" Id.  \n                                                  \n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\n          Here, Whittemore has failed  to establish cause for his\n\nfailure to  raise his claims in the  first petition.  The factual\n\nand legal basis  for Whittemore's   2255 petition is that the key\n\nprosecution witness  at his  trial gave false  testimony, causing\n\nhim  to be convicted,  and that a  key witness at  his sentencing\n\nhearing  also gave  false  testimony, causing  him  to receive  a\n\nlonger term  of  imprisonment.   Whittemore  has  not  shown  the\n\n\"reasonable unavailability  of the  factual and legal  basis\" for\n\nhis  claim.   Nor  has  Whittemore  shown  some  other  \"external\n\nimpediment\" for his  failure to  raise the  claim.   Whittemore's\n\nbasic  claim is that his  sentence should be  vacated because two\n\nkey prosecution witnesses lied.   This is a straightforward claim\n\nwhich he could have presented at the time of his  first petition,\n\neven though  he did not have  the funds to hire  counsel and even\n\nthough he was unfamiliar with the law.  \n\n          The Supreme Court held in McCleskey that a petitioner's\n                                             \n\nexplanation for failing to  raise a claim in an  earlier petition\n\nmust be based on some \"objective factor external to the defense.\"\n\nMcCleskey, 111 S.Ct.  at 1470.   The reasons Whittemore  advances\n         \n\nfor failing  to raise  his claim  in the  first petition  are not\n\nbased  on any  objective  factor external  to  his defense.    We\n\ntherefore cannot rationally conclude that Whittemore's ability to\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nraise  his claim in the  earlier petition was  somehow impeded by\n\nthe fact that he was acting pro se at the time.  \n                                  \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we  will affirm the order of\n\nthe district court dismissing  Whittemore's second petition under\n\n28 U.S.C.   2255.   \n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n",

Petitioner, Robert\n                                            \n\nA. Whittemore,  appeals from  the denial of  his second  petition\n\nunder  28  U.S.C.   2255 to  set  aside,  vacate  or correct  his\n\nsentence.  The district court dismissed the petition as an \"abuse\n\nof the writ\".  We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In June 1988,  Whittemore was convicted of one count of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute  cocaine, and two\n\ncounts of knowingly and  intentionally distributing a quantity of\n\ncocaine.  At  trial the prosecution  showed that Whittemore  sold\n\nTyrone  Gray, a  government informant,  an  ounce of  cocaine for\n\n$1,500  on  one occasion,  and  two  kilograms worth  $72,000  on\n\nanother occasion.   The  prosecution also showed  that Whittemore\n\nconspired with Gray  and a  woman named Lisa  Obremski to  obtain\n\ncocaine in Florida and distribute it in Maine.\n\n          Following  his  conviction, Whittemore  entered  into a\n\ncooperation agreement with the government in which  he waived the\n\nright of direct appeal of his conviction.  The government in turn\n\ngave Whittemore \"use immunity\" for his cooperative statements and\n\nagreed  to  notify   the  sentencing  court  of  the   extent  of\n\nWhittemore's cooperation.  Thereafter, in August 1988, Whittemore\n\nwas sentenced to imprisonment  for 15 years on all  three counts,\n\nto  be served concurrently, and 10 years of supervised release on\n\nthe two counts of distribution, to run concurrently.\n\n          On  April 25,  1991, Whittemore  wrote to  the district\n\ncourt,  requesting the court to  issue an order  stating that his\n\nsentence was subject to parole.  The court treated the letter  as\n\na motion to correct  a sentence under Rule  35(a) of the  Federal\n\nRules of Criminal  Procedure.   The court held  that the  charges\n\nunder  which Whittemore was  convicted were subject  to the Anti-\n\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986 and therefore did not permit parole.  \n\n          On August 19, 1991,  Whittemore filed pro se  his first\n                                                      \n\n 2255  petition.  In this first petition, Whittemore again raised\n\nthe  issue  of  whether   he  was  appropriately  precluded  from\n\nconsideration for parole by the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse\n\nAct of 1986.  On  October 17, 1991, the district court  once more\n\nfound  that Whittemore's  conviction was  clearly subject  to the\n\nnon-parolable provisions  of the  Anti-Drug Abuse Act  and denied\n\nhis petition without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          On November 12, 1991, Whittemore filed, again pro se, a\n                                                              \n\nsecond     2255 petition.    This time,  Whittemore  raised three\n\nissues  as grounds  to vacate  or correct  his sentence.   First,\n\nWhittemore claimed that Tyrone Gray  gave false testimony for the\n\nprosecution  at Whittemore's  trial,  thereby causing  him to  be\n\nconvicted.   Second,  he claimed  that Lisa  Obremski gave  false\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\ntestimony  at  his   sentencing  hearing,  thereby   causing  the\n\nsentencing  judge  to  impose  a  longer  term  of  imprisonment.\n\nFinally,  Whittemore  claimed  that  he was  entitled  to  credit\n\nagainst his sentence for time served prior to his conviction.\n\n          On December  3, 1991,  the government moved  to dismiss\n\nWhittemore's second  petition on the ground,  among other things,\n\nthat Whittemore  alleged claims  in the  petition which he  could\n\nhave  asserted in  the earlier  petition.   On December  7, 1991,\n\nWhittemore  responded to the government's motion.  In a letter to\n\nthe court,  Whittemore explained  why his second  petition should\n\nnot be dismissed.  Whittemore wrote in part:\n\n          I did  not know  that when  I filed  my first  motion I\n          should  have put  these other  points in  as well.   My\n          first  motion was done by  a friend that  worked in the\n          law  library.   Had I  understood this their  [sic] are\n          some other points I would have made on this last one.\n\n          On  January  15,   1992,  the  district   court  denied\n\nWhittemore's second petition without an evidentiary hearing.  The\n\ncourt found that the government had carried its burden of showing\n\nthat Whittemore had abused the writ of habeas  corpus.  The court\n\nalso determined that Whittemore  had failed to show  that failure\n\nto entertain his second petition would result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice.  As to Whittemore's claim that he was entitled to credit\n\nfor time served prior to his conviction, the court concluded that\n\nWhittemore  had not  exhausted  his  administrative  remedies  by\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nfailing  to pursue his claim with the  Bureau of Prisons.  In any\n\nevent, the court  reasoned, even if Whittemore had  exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies, he  would not be entitled  to credit for\n\ntime served because he was out on bail and not incarcerated prior\n\nto his conviction.\n\n          On appeal, Whittemore, now represented by  counsel, has\n\nabandoned his claim  that he  is entitled to  credit against  his\n\nsentence  for time served  prior to conviction.   Whittemore also\n\ndoes  not  challenge  on  appeal  the  court's  finding  that  no\n\nfundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to\n\nentertain  the claims in the  second   2255  petition.1  Instead,\n\nWhittemore presents  three main  arguments: 1) that  the district\n\ncourt erred in not giving him notice that his second petition was\n\nsubject to  dismissal for abuse of the writ; 2) that the abuse of\n\nthe writ  standard  is  inapplicable  because his  first  pro  se\n                                                                 \n\npetition  \"was filed  out of  ignorance\" and,  therefore  \"had no\n\n                       \n\n   1In responding to the district court's finding that no\n   miscarriage of justice would result from denying his second\n   petition, Whittemore writes in his brief on appeal: \"It is\n   not Mr. Whittemore's purpose within the context of this\n   appeal to challenge the district court `miscarriage of\n   justice' analysis.\"  Appellant's Brief at 8-9.  Accordingly,\n   we need not address in detail the court's miscarriage of\n   justice analysis. It suffices to say that we would agree\n   with the district court's conclusion that, under McCleskey\n                                                             \n   v.

The burden  is on the government  to first plead\n\nabuse of the  writ. Id. at 1470.   The government satisfies  this\n                       \n\nburden \"if, with clarity and particularity, it notes petitioner's\n\nprior  writ history, identifies  the claims  that appear  for the\n\nfirst time, and alleges that petitioner has abused the writ.\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\n          The burden to  disprove abuse of the writ  then becomes\n\npetitioner's. Id.   In order  to satisfy this  burden, petitioner\n                 \n\nmust  show cause for failing to raise earlier the claim presented\n\nin the subsequent petition.  Id.  To show cause,  petitioner must\n                                \n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nshow  that  some   external  impediment,  such   as  governmental\n\ninterference or  the reasonable unavailability of  the factual or\n\nlegal  basis for a claim,  prevented the claim  from being raised\n\nearlier.  Id.  at 1472.   If  petitioner  cannot show  cause \"the\n             \n\nfailure to raise the claim in an earlier petition may nonetheless\n\nbe  excused if he or she can  show that a fundamental miscarriage\n\nof justice would result  from a failure to entertain  the claim.\"\n\nId. at 1470.\n   \n\n                                A.\n\n          As a  preliminary matter,  Whittemore argues  on appeal\n\nthat the district court erred  in not giving him notice  that his\n\nsecond petition was subject  to dismissal.  Whittemore's argument\n\ngoes  as follows: Rule 9(b)  of the Rules  Governing Section 2255\n\nProceedings provides that a second or successive  2255 motion may\n\nbe  dismissed if  the  court finds  that petitioner's  failure to\n\nassert  grounds  in  an  earlier petition  constituted  abuse  of\n\nprocess.  Following Rule 9(b) in the appendix of forms is a model\n\nform to  be  used in   2255 petitions.   This  form \"was  clearly\n\ndrafted for the  benefit of the  pro se litigant.\"   The form  is\n                                       \n\ndesigned to give the  pro se petitioner specific notice  that the\n                            \n\npetition is subject to dismissal.  Whittemore, at the time of the\n\nfiling of his second   2255 petition, was a pro  se litigant. The\n                                                   \n\ndistrict  court never  sent  the Rule  9(b)  form to  Whittemore.\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nTherefore, Whittemore  argues,  this  court  should  reverse  the\n\ndistrict court's order dismissing his second petition.\n\n          We find  this argument unconvincing.   The fact  of the\n\nmatter is Whittemore did have notice that his second petition was\n\nsubject to dismissal.  The form which he used to file the first  \n\n2255 petition contained the warning: \"CAUTION: If you fail to set\n\nforth  all ground[s]  in  this motion,  you  may be  barred  from\n\npresenting  additional grounds  at a  later date.\"   Furthermore,\n\nWhittemore  actually responded  to  the  government's  motion  to\n\ndismiss  his second  petition.   In  a  letter to  the court,  he\n\nexplained that at the time he filed his first petition he did not\n\nknow that he  was supposed to present all of  his claims at once.\n\nFinally, we have never held in this circuit that failure  to give\n\nspecific notice to a  petitioner is alone grounds to  reverse the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a   2255  petition for abuse of the\n\nwrit, especially when,  as here, the petitioner had actual notice\n\nthat  the petition was  subject to  dismissal. See  McLaughlin v.\n                                                                 \n\nGabriel,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430608\"><a href=\"/opinion/430608/george-mclaughlin-v-harold-gabriel-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  10 (1st Cir. 1984)  (pleading abuse of the\n       \n\nwrit  puts petitioner on notice to show cause why claim raised in\n\nsubsequent petition was not brought in an earlier petition).\n\n                                B.\n\n          Whittemore next argues that  the McCleskey abuse of the\n                                                    \n\nwrit  standard  should not  be  applied  to his  second  petition\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nbecause  his  first petition  \"was filed  out of  ignorance\" and,\n\ntherefore  \"had  no substantive  meaning.\"      As we  understand\n\nWhittemore's argument, the first    2255 petition raised an issue\n\nwhich  the court  had  already  denied  in Whittemore's  Rule  35\n\nmotion; namely the issue  of whether his sentence was  subject to\n\nparole.   The  district  court,  in  denying  the  first     2255\n\npetition,  did not rule  on the merits  of the  claim, since that\n\nclaim had already been decided in the Rule 35 motion.  Therefore,\n\nWhittemore  argues, for  purposes of  determining whether  he has\n\nabused the writ, the first   2255 petition should  not count, and\n\nthe second petition should in effect be considered the first.\n\n          Whittemore  has  not cited  any  case  to support  this\n\nrather ingenious proposition.   In  any event, the  point of  the\n\ndoctrine of abuse  of the writ, as explained in McCleskey, is not\n                                                         \n\nwhat  petitioner alleges in the first   2255 petition, but rather\n\nwhat  petition does not allege in the first petition.  McCleskey,\n                                                                \n\n111  S.Ct. at  1470.   Thus, it  is not  relevant that  the claim\n\nWhittemore made in the  first petition was one which  had already\n\nbeen decided by  the court.   The point is  that in bringing  the\n\nfirst petition  Whittemore was  obligated to present  all of  the\n\nclaims which he now raises in the second petition.\n\n                                C.\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\n          Whittemore's  remaining contention is that, even if the\n\nabuse  of the writ analysis is applicable to his second petition,\n\nhe did satisfy the burden to  show cause for his failure to raise\n\nhis  claims   in  the  earlier   2255   petition.    Specifically\n\nWhittemore explains that the  issues raised in the second    2255\n\nmotion were not raised in the  first   2255 motion because he did\n\nnot have the funds to hire an attorney, he was not represented by\n\ncounsel at the time  of both motions, and he  was unfamiliar with\n\nthe law.  \n\n          In  Andiarena v.

We  reasoned that under  the\n                \n\nstandard  established in  McCleskey,  \"to  establish `cause'  for\n                                   \n\nfailure to raise a claim in a prior petition, one  must show that\n\nsome external impediment, such  as government interference or the\n\nreasonable unavailability  of the factual  and legal basis  for a\n\nclaim prevented it from being raised earlier.\" Id.  \n                                                  \n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\n          Here, Whittemore has failed  to establish cause for his\n\nfailure to  raise his claims in the  first petition.  The factual\n\nand legal basis  for Whittemore's   2255 petition is that the key\n\nprosecution witness  at his  trial gave false  testimony, causing\n\nhim  to be convicted,  and that a  key witness at  his sentencing\n\nhearing  also gave  false  testimony, causing  him  to receive  a\n\nlonger term  of  imprisonment.   Whittemore  has  not  shown  the\n\n\"reasonable unavailability  of the  factual and legal  basis\" for\n\nhis  claim.   Nor  has  Whittemore  shown  some  other  \"external\n\nimpediment\" for his  failure to  raise the  claim.   Whittemore's\n\nbasic  claim is that his  sentence should be  vacated because two\n\nkey prosecution witnesses lied.   This is a straightforward claim\n\nwhich he could have presented at the time of his  first petition,\n\neven though  he did not have  the funds to hire  counsel and even\n\nthough he was unfamiliar with the law.  \n\n          The Supreme Court held in McCleskey that a petitioner's\n                                             \n\nexplanation for failing to  raise a claim in an  earlier petition\n\nmust be based on some \"objective factor external to the defense.\"\n\nMcCleskey, 111 S.Ct.  at 1470.   The reasons Whittemore  advances\n         \n\nfor failing  to raise  his claim  in the  first petition  are not\n\nbased  on any  objective  factor external  to  his defense.    We\n\ntherefore cannot rationally conclude that Whittemore's ability to\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nraise  his claim in the  earlier petition was  somehow impeded by\n\nthe fact that he was acting pro se at the time.  \n                                  \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we  will affirm the order of\n\nthe district court dismissing  Whittemore's second petition under\n\n28 U.S.C.   2255.   \n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n</pre>",
