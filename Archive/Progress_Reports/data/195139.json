Gentile,  Senior  Legal  Counsel,  Department  of\n                     \nCorrections,  on  Memorandum  in Support  of  Motion  for Summary\nDisposition for appellees.\n\n                                        \n                       January 13, 1994\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.    Plaintiff Norberto Andrade  filed an\n                    \n\naction  pursuant to  42  U.S.C.    1983  claiming that  Rhode\n\nIsland correctional  personnel  had used  excessive force  to\n\nrestrain  him and  had provided  inadequate  medical care  in\n\nviolation of the  Eighth Amendment.  Following  the dismissal\n\nof  three of  the  five  defendants, a  jury  trial was  held\n\nresulting  in  verdicts   in  favor  of  the   remaining  two\n\ndefendants.\n\n          1.    The  district  court permitted  plaintiff  to\n\nproceed in  forma pauperis.   Plaintiff argues  that it  also\n                          \n\nshould  have granted  his  request  for  the  appointment  of\n\ncounsel.   Counsel  in  civil  cases  are appointed  only  in\n\n\"exceptional circumstances.\"  DesRosiers  v. Moran, 949  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n15, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).   In determining whether a party  has\n\nmet this standard, \"a court must examine the total situation,\n\nfocusing,  inter  alia,  on  the  merits  of  the  case,  the\n                      \n\ncomplexity of the legal issues, and the litigant's ability to\n\nrepresent himself.\"   Id. at 24.   Further, on  our review of\n                        \n\nthe record,  we will  reverse the  district court's  decision\n\n\"only if  the record, taken  as a whole, reflects  a manifest\n\nabuse of the trial court's broad discretion.\"  Id.\n                                                 \n\n          Although  there is  support  for plaintiff's  claim\n\nthat he is illiterate, this same evidence -- a psychologist's\n\nevaluation  -- describes plaintiff  as bright, alert  and, in\n\nterms  of  his   mental  functioning,  able  to   \"deliver  a\n\n                             -2-\n\nreasonable stream of clear ideas that were pertinent and well\n\nconnected to the subjects being  discussed.\"  Thus, we do not\n\nbelieve that  plaintiff's  ability to  represent himself  was\n\nsignificantly  hampered  by  his  illiteracy.    Further, his\n\ncomplaint  concerned events that had occurred during a single\n\nday and  the applicable  Eighth Amendment  standards are  not\n\nparticularly complicated.   As a result, we find  no abuse of\n\ndiscretion  in the district  court's decision not  to appoint\n\ncounsel to represent plaintiff.\n\n          2.   As far as we can determine, plaintiff's second\n\nargument on appeal  concerns the sufficiency of  the evidence\n\nas to exactly  how he received a  cut on his head  during the\n\nincident  in question.  Specifically, plaintiff refers to the\n\ntestimony  of  one  of  the  defendants  at  the state  trial\n\n(plaintiff  was  charged  with assault  upon  a  correctional\n\nofficer on the basis of the events giving rise to this   1983\n\naction).  According to plaintiff, this defendant at the state\n\ntrial  testified  that  he did  not  know  how plaintiff  had\n\nreceived  the laceration on  his head.   Apparently, the same\n\ndefendant  at the  district court  trial  gave a  conflicting\n\naccount of how plaintiff's injury occurred.\n\n          Without a transcript of either the state or federal\n\ncourt trials, it is not possible for us to review this claim.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2) provides:\n\n               If the plaintiff  intends to urge on\n          appeal that  a finding  or conclusion  is\n\n                             -3-\n\n          unsupported   by  the   evidence  or   is\n          contrary to  the evidence,  the plaintiff\n          shall include in the record a  transcript\n          of all evidence  relevant to such finding\n          or conclusion.\n\nAs for  the district court  proceedings, \"[t]he burden  is on\n\nthe   plaintiff  to  provide  this  court  with  an  appendix\n\nsufficient to support [his] points on appeal.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  One Motor  Yacht, 527  F.2d  1112, 1113  (1st Cir.  1975)\n                    \n\n(appendix  did  not  include  transcript  of  hearing  before\n\ndistrict court).  \"Where  a plaintiff raises issues  that are\n\nfactually  dependant yet fails to provide a transcript of the\n\npertinent proceedings in the district court, this circuit has\n\nrepeatedly held  that we  will not  review the  allegations.\"\n\nMuniz Ramirez  v. Puerto Rico  Fire Services, 757  F.2d 1357,\n                                            \n\n1358 (1st Cir. 1985).  See also Fisher v.

The district court denied plaintiff's request,\n\nfinding   that  plaintiff   wanted   the  entire   transcript\n\n                             -4-\n\nessentially  for the  purpose of  having  a \"retrial\"  of the\n\nevidence  on appeal.  Because he had  already had a \"full and\n\nfair opportunity\"  to present all of his  evidence before the\n\njury, the court determined that his appeal failed to assert a\n\nsubstantial question of law.\n\n          Indigence, however, does  not relieve plaintiff  of\n\nthe burden  to produce  the transcript  under Rule  10(b)(2).\n\nSee Richardson v. Henry, 902  F.2d 414, 416 (5th Cir.) (court\n                       \n\nwould dismiss pro se appeal concerning his sufficiency of the\n\nevidence claim  despite  plaintiff's inability  to  afford  a\n\ntranscript), cert.  denied, 498  U.S. 901  (1990); Thomas  v.\n                                                         \n\nComputax   Corp.,  631  F.2d  139,  142-43  (9th  Cir.  1980)\n                \n\n(inability to pay  for transcript does make  it \"unavailable\"\n\nwithin the  meaning of Rule  10(c) which allows  plaintiff to\n\nprepare  a  statement   of  evidence  based  on  his  or  her\n\nrecollection; court dismissed appeal).\n\n          Plaintiff  has  not  renewed  his  request   for  a\n\ntranscript in this  court nor  has he  appealed the  district\n\ncourt's denial under   753(f).  In any event, the fact that a\n\nwitness gave inconsistent testimony at a prior trial does not\n\nitself   raise   a   substantial   question.      Credibility\n\ndeterminations are solely reserved for the jury.  See Glasser\n                                                             \n\nv. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80 (1942).  Thus, even  taking\n                \n\nplaintiff's claim  at face  value, there is  no merit  to the\n\nappeal.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -6-\n",

See also Fisher v. Krajewski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522241\"><a href=\"/opinion/522241/lloyd-b-fisher-v-judge-james-j-krajewski/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span>, 1060, 1068 (7th Cir. 1989) (in the absence of the transcript, it is not possible to review rulings made from the bench and the court \"will not render a judicial decision founded on speculation\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></span> (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware of plaintiff's indigent status and that he filed, in the district court, a request for the trial transcript under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 753(f) (A transcript paid for by government is available only if the trial judge \"certifies that the appeal is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question).\").  The district court denied plaintiff's request, finding that plaintiff wanted the entire transcript essentially for the purpose of having a \"retrial\" of the evidence on appeal.  Because he had already had a \"full and fair opportunity\" to present all of his evidence before the jury, the court determined that his appeal failed to assert a substantial question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indigence, however, does not relieve plaintiff of the burden to produce the transcript under Rule 10(b)(2).

In any event, the fact that a witness gave inconsistent testimony at a prior trial does not itself raise a substantial question.  Credibility determinations are solely reserved for the jury.   See Glasser v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103597\"><a href=\"/opinion/103597/glasser-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 80 (1942).
