More than two  years after\n          STAHL, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\nsuffering  an  injury  at  sea,   plaintiff-appellant  Robert\n\nWilson1 attempted  to amend  his complaint against  a private\n\nparty to include the United States as defendant.  The amended\n\ncomplaint sought damages under the Public Vessels Act and the\n\nSuits in  Admiralty  Act,  both  of which  carry  a  two-year\n\nstatute  of limitations.   The  district court  dismissed the\n\nclaims as time-barred,  declining to  apply either  equitable\n\ntolling,  or   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.   15(c)'s  \"relation  back\"\n\nprovisions.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          On  September  10,  1988, Wilson,  an  employee  of\n\nGeneral  Electric  Government  Services,   Inc.  (hereinafter\n\n\"GEGS\"), whose  job entailed maintaining a  fleet of Seaborne\n\nPowered  Target Boats (hereinafter  \"SEPTARs\") for the United\n\nStates  Navy, was  sent to  sea by  GEGS, along  with several\n\nother  employees, in  a SEPTAR.   Wilson  and the  other crew\n\nmembers  became stranded  in Hurricane  Gilbert  and required\n\nrescue by the Coast Guard.  \n\n          On September  30, 1988,  and again on  November 23,\n\n1988,  counsel  for  Wilson   wrote  to  United  States  Navy\n\nofficials  requesting  transcripts  of  radio  communications\n\n                    \n\n1.  Wilson,  one of  several  plaintiffs below,  is the  only\nplaintiff to pursue appeal.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nrecorded  during  the  stranding  incident.     Counsel  also\n\nrequested  the results of  any Navy  investigations regarding\n\nthe incident.  These letters did  not allude in any manner to\n\nthe  possibility that the United  States might be  a party in\n\nany  capacity to any legal  proceeding. In fact,  at the time\n\nthe requests  were sent, no  complaint against any  party had\n\nyet been filed.\n\n          On  September 8,  1989, almost  a year  after these\n\nrequests  to the  Navy, Wilson  and other crew  members filed\n\nsuit against GEGS under  the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.    688, for\n\ninjuries allegedly  suffered in the stranding  incident.  The\n\nUnited  States received no notice of these suits, nor was the\n\nUnited States,  or any of its departments  or agencies, named\n\nas  a party.    On  April 2,  1990,  GEGS  moved for  summary\n\njudgment,  arguing  that the  United  States  Navy owned  the\n\nSEPTAR  on which Wilson and the others were injured, and that\n\ntherefore the  United  States was  the only  proper party  in\n\ninterest.   \n\n          In response  to GEGS's motion for summary judgment,\n\nWilson filed a motion  on June 8, 1990, requesting  that GEGS\n\nbe  dismissed from  the suit  and that  the United  States be\n\nsubstituted  as defendant.   On June  19, 1990,  the district\n\ncourt  dismissed  GEGS from  the  suit  and granted  Wilson's\n\nmotion to amend his complaint.  \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          Though  the  district court  had granted  leave for\n\nWilson to amend  his complaint, more than two  months elapsed\n\nand  Wilson had  still not  filed an  amended complaint.   On\n\nSeptember  10, 1990, two years to the day after the stranding\n\nincident,  the  court  notified  Wilson  that  he  had  until\n\nSeptember  24, 1990, i.e., fourteen days from the date of the\n\norder, to file an  amended complaint, or the action  would be\n\ndismissed for lack of  prosecution.  It is important  to note\n\nthat when the court  issued this deadline, the United  States\n\nhad received no notice that it would be named a  party to the\n\nsuit and the amended complaint had not yet been filed.  Thus,\n\nas far  as the  record indicates,  no statute  of limitations\n\nissue was before the district court when it set the September\n\n24, 1990, deadline.\n\n          The amended complaint  was filed  on September  25,\n\n1990,2 the  day after  the deadline  imposed by the  district\n                     \n\ncourt.  It alleged liability under the Public Vessels Act, 46\n\nU.S.C.    781-90 and the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.   \n\n741-52.  Suits under these statutes  carry a two-year statute\n\nof  limitations.   Along with  the amended  complaint, Wilson\n\nfiled  a motion  requesting the  court to  \"relate back\"  the\n\n                    \n\n2.  Wilson's  brief  misleadingly  states  that  the  amended\ncomplaint  was filed on September 24, 1990.  The court docket\nand the magistrate's report, however, both list September 25,\n1990   as  the   filing  date   of  the   amended  complaint.\nFurthermore, the  amended complaint included in  the Wilson's\nappendix is date stamped  by the clerk's office \"1990  SEP 25\nAM 9:51.\"\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nfiling  date of the amended complaint to that of the original\n\ncomplaint.   The  United  States  was  not  served  with  the\n\ncomplaint until  November 16, 1990, fifty-two  days after the\n\namended complaint was filed.  On January 8, 1991,  the United\n\nStates  moved to  dismiss  the action  as  time-barred.   The\n\nmatter  was then  referred  to a  magistrate  who found  that\n\nWilson had indeed missed  the two-year statute of limitations\n\nand had provided no basis for either relating back the filing\n\ndate of the amended  complaint, or for equitably tolling  the\n\nlimitations period.   On June  30, 1993,  the district  court\n\nadopted the magistrate's findings and dismissed the action as\n\ntime-barred.  Wilson appeals from this ruling.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Both  the Suits  in  Admiralty Act  and the  Public\n\nVessels Act  apply when a plaintiff  brings a \"public-vessel-\n\nrelated  suit  in  admiralty  against  the  United   States.\"\n\nJustice v. United States, 6 F.3d 1474, 1475 (11th Cir. 1993).\n                        \n\nCauses  of action under both Acts \"may be brought only within\n\ntwo  years after the  cause of action  arises.\"   46 U.S.C.  \n\n745.  A cause of action  \"arises\" under both Acts on the date\n\nof injury.  See, e.g., McMahon v. United States, 342 U.S. 25,\n                                               \n\n27 (1951) (\"[W]e think it  clear that the proper construction\n\nof the  language used in the  Suits in Admiralty  Act is that\n\nthe period of  limitation is to be computed from  the date of\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthe  injury.\");  Justice, 6  F.3d at  1475 (stating  that the\n                        \n\nPublic Vessels Act incorporates the statute of limitations of\n\nthe Suits in Admiralty Act).3\n\n          There is  no dispute  that  the original  complaint\n\nagainst  GEGS was timely filed,  nor can it  be disputed that\n\nthe  amended complaint  which  named the  United States  as a\n\nparty was first  filed more than two years  after the date of\n\ninjury.   Wilson  offers two  grounds  for arguing  that  the\n\namended complaint  should  nonetheless be  viewed as  timely.\n\nFirst, Wilson argues that the two-year statute of limitations\n\nshould be  equitably  tolled.   Second,  he argues  that  the\n\namended complaint  should be deemed  to \"relate back\"  to the\n\ndate of filing of  the original complaint under Fed.  R. Civ.\n\nP. 15(c).  We address these arguments in turn.\n\nA.  Equitable Tolling\n                     \n\n          Federal  courts have allowed equitable tolling only\n\nsparingly.  Irwin  v. Veterans  Admin., 111 S.  Ct. 453,  457\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n3.  The  Public Vessels  Act incorporates  provisions of  the\nSuits  in  Admiralty  Act,  \"insofar  as  the  same  are  not\ninconsistent\"  with the Public Vessels Act.  46 U.S.C.   782.\nThis  includes the  two-year  statute of  limitations.   See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Justice, 6  F.3d at 1475; Favorite v.  Marine Personnel\n                                                             \nand  Provisioning, Inc., 955 F.2d  382, 385, 388-89 (5th Cir.\n                       \n1992) (applying Suits in Admiralty Act's two-year  limitation\nin  case involving claims  under both the  Public Vessels Act\nand Suits in Admiralty Act).  Wilson's brief alludes  vaguely\nto the notion that the two-year statute of limitations in the\nPublic Vessels  Act operates in  a manner different  from the\nstatute of limitations  in the  Suits in Admiralty  Act.   We\nhave found  no  support  for  this argument,  either  in  the\nstatutes  themselves  or  in  the  cases  interpreting  these\nstatutes.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n(1990).  For example, such tolling has been allowed where the\n\nclaimant actively pursued a timely yet defective pleading, or\n\nwhere  the   complainant  was  tricked   by  his  adversary's\n\nmisconduct into allowing a deadline to pass.  See id. at 457-\n                                                     \n\n58 nn.  4 &amp; 5 (compiling  cases).  Where, on  the other hand,\n\n\"`the  claimant   [fails]  to   exercise  due   diligence  in\n\npreserving his[/her]  legal rights,' courts are  reluctant to\n\napply  principles of  equitable tolling  to extend  a federal\n\nlimitations period.\"   De Casenave v. United States, 991 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n11, 13 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Irwin, 111 S. Ct. at 458).\n                                     \n\n          In  this case,  Wilson's failure  at more  than one\n\njuncture  to  exercise  due  diligence proves  fatal  to  his\n\nrequest for equitable tolling.  First, Wilson asks us to toll\n\nthe statute of limitations because he purportedly was unaware\n\nat the time he filed suit that the United States, rather than\n\nGEGS, owned the SEPTAR on which  he was injured.  He  further\n\nstates that  GEGS's  delay in  filing  a motion  for  summary\n\njudgment on  these grounds caused undue  delay in determining\n\nthe ownership of the SEPTAR, which in turn warrants equitable\n\ntolling. \n\n          The magistrate's  report points out,  however, that\n\nthe ownership of the SEPTAR easily could and should have been\n\ndetermined  through  routine  discovery.    Wilson offers  no\n\nevidence to the contrary.  Nor does he allege any trickery or\n\nother  questionable motive  on the  part of  GEGS.   In fact,\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthere is no evidence in the record tending to  show that GEGS\n\nwas dilatory in  alerting the district court that  the United\n\nStates  owned the  SEPTAR.   Similarly,  there  is no  record\n\nevidence showing  that Wilson  made any attempt  to ascertain\n\nwho owned the SEPTAR,  nor is there any evidence  that Wilson\n\npursued discovery on this,  or any other issue in  this case.\n\nIn sum,  nothing in  the record controverts  the magistrate's\n\nfinding that  the  issue of  ownership could  have been  made\n\nknown through  routine discovery procedures.  Thus, we see no\n\nreason  to  toll  the statute  of  limitations  based on  the\n\nactions  of  GEGS  in this  case.    Cf.  Favorite v.  Marine\n                                                             \n\nPersonnel and Provisioning, Inc., 955 F.2d 382, 388 (5th Cir.\n                                \n\n1992)  (declining  to  equitably  toll  two-year  statute  of\n\nlimitations under the  Suits in Admiralty Act  and the Public\n\nVessels  Act  where  plaintiff  \"waited to  bring  suit  only\n\nbecause he believed he could sue . . . his private employer[]\n\nunder  the three-year  statute  of limitations  in the  Jones\n\nAct\").\n\n          More  important  than Wilson's  initial  failure to\n\nascertain the identity of the SEPTAR's owner, however, is the\n\nfact that Wilson  did learn  of the actual  ownership of  the\n                     \n\nSEPTAR  more   than  five   months  before  the   statute  of\n\nlimitations  expired, i.e.,  when GEGS  filed its  motion for\n\nsummary judgment.  Still, Wilson did not amend his complaint.\n\nIn fact, Wilson  filed the amended  complaint only after  the\n                                                        \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndistrict court threatened  to dismiss  the case  for lack  of\n\nprosecution.   Wilson  offers no  reason  or excuse  for this\n\ndelay.    We  see  no basis  for  extending  the  exceptional\n\ndoctrine  of  equitable  tolling  to  a  party  who,  by  all\n\naccounts, merely failed  to exercise his rights.   Cf. Puleio\n                                                             \n\nv.

In\n                                   \n\nsum, the  record before  us reflects  that  Wilson failed  to\n\nexercise due diligence in pursuing his claim, and thus we see\n\nno grounds for applying the doctrine of equitable tolling.\n\nB. \"Relation Back\" Under Fed.

Rule 15(c) states:\n\n          An Amendment  of a pleading  relates back\n          to the date of the original pleading when\n            (1) relation back  is permitted by  the\n          law   that   provides   the  statute   of\n          limitations applicable to the action, or\n            (2)  the claim  or defense  asserted in\n          the  amended pleading  arose  out of  the\n          conduct,  transaction, or  occurrence set\n          forth or attempted to be set forth in the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          We begin by noting  that Wilson failed to  meet one\n\nof Rule  15(c)(3)'s  mechanical requirements,  namely,  that,\n\nwithin 120  days of  the filing  of the  original complaint,5\n\n                    \n\n          original pleading, or\n            (3) the amendment  changes the party or\n          the naming of  the party  against whom  a\n          claim  is  asserted   if  the   foregoing\n          provision  (2)  is satisfied  and, within\n          the  period  provided  by  Rule  4(m) for\n          service of the summons and complaint, the\n          party to  be brought in by  amendment (A)\n          has   received   such   notice   of   the\n          institution  of the action that the party\n          will not  be prejudiced in  maintaining a\n          defense  on the merits,  and (B)  knew or\n          should have known that, but for a mistake\n          concerning  the  identity  of the  proper\n          party, the action would have been brought\n          against the party.\n\n          The delivery or mailing of process to the\n          United States Attorney, or  United States\n          Attorney's  designee,   or  the  Attorney\n          General  of  the  United  States,  or  an\n          agency or  officer who would have  been a\n          proper defendant if named,  satisfies the\n          requirement of subparagraphs (A)  and (B)\n          of this paragraph (3) with respect to the\n          United  States or  any agency  or officer\n          thereof to be brought  into the action as\n          a defendant.\n\n5.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), cited in Rule 15(c), states:\n\n          If service  of the summons  and complaint\n          is  not made upon  a defendant within 120\n          days after the  filing of the  complaint,\n          the  court, upon  motion  or on  its  own\n          initiative after notice to the plaintiff,\n          shall   dismiss    the   action   without\n          prejudice as to  that defendant or direct\n          that   service   be  effected   within  a\n          specified  time;  provided  that  if  the\n          plaintiff  shows  good   cause  for   the\n          failure, the court shall extend  the time\n          for  service  for an  appropriate period.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n\"the party to be brought in by amendment . .  . received such\n\nnotice of the institution  of the action that the  party will\n                                        \n\nnot be  prejudiced in maintaining  a defense on  the merits.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied).  The record shows that the United States\n\nreceived notice of  this action no earlier  than November 16,\n\n1990, the date that it was served with the amended complaint.\n\n          In arguing  that the United States  nonetheless had\n\nadequate notice of the claim against GEGS, Wilson points only\n\nto   his  counsel's  requests   for  radio   transcripts  and\n\ninvestigation results from the Navy.  These requests occurred\n\nsome nine  months  prior to  the  institution of  the  action\n                        \n\nagainst GEGS.  Moreover,  the correspondence does not advert,\n\nformally  or informally,  to  the institution  of any  action\n                                             \n\nagainst the United  States or any other  party.  Accordingly,\n\nwe find no  means in the  record to conclude that  the United\n\nStates ever received  timely notice of the institution of the\n\nsuit  against  GEGS.     Without  this  timely  notice,  Rule\n\n15(c)(3)'s relation back provisions cannot apply.6\n\n                    \n\n          This  subdivision  does   not  apply   to\n          service in a  foreign country pursuant to\n          subdivision (f) or (j)(1).\n\n6.  In  addition,  Wilson  cites  the  \"identity-of-interest\"\ngloss on Rule 15(c) which we endorsed in Hernandez Jimenez v.\n                                                          \nCalero  Toledo,  604 F.2d  99, 102-03  (1st  Cir. 1979).   We\n              \nstated there  that \"the institution  of the action  serves as\nconstructive notice of the action  to the parties added after\nthe limitations  period expired, when the  original and added\nparties  are   so  closely  related  in   business  or  other\n                                                             \nactivities that  it  is fair  to  presume the  added  parties\n          \nlearned of the institution of the action shortly after it was\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          An additional requirement  for relation back  under\n\nRule  15(c)(3) is  that the  party to  be added  by amendment\n\n\"knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning\n\nthe  identity of the proper party, the action would have been\n\nbrought against the party.\"   There is no basis  for imputing\n\nsuch  knowledge to the United States on the record before us.\n\n          Finally,   the   Seventh   Circuit   has   recently\n\nreiterated that \n\n          \"amendment [of a complaint] with relation\n          back is  generally permitted in  order to\n          correct  a misnomer of  a defendant where\n          the  proper  defendant is  already before\n          the  court and  the effect  is  merely to\n          correct the name under which he  is sued.\n          But  a new  defendant cannot  normally be\n          substituted or added  by amendment  after\n          the statute of limitations has run.\"  \n\nWorthington  v.

Put  another   way,  Rule  15(c)(3)  \"`permits  an\n\namendment to relate back  only where there has been  an error\n\nmade concerning the  identity of the  proper party and  where\n\nthat party is  chargeable with knowledge of the  mistake, but\n\n                    \n\ncommenced.\"   Id.    To support his argument  that the United\n                 \nStates  had such  constructive  notice in  this case,  Wilson\ncites  only  the contract  between  the Navy  and  GEGS which\ngoverned the  operation of the  SEPTARs.  Without  more, this\ncontract does not permit a  conclusion that the United States\nand  GEGS were so closely related in business that the United\nStates  can be presumed to  have received notice  of the case\nagainst GEGS, nor does any other record evidence support such\na conclusion.   \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nit  does not permit relation back  where, as here, there is a\n                                                             \n\nlack  of knowledge of the proper party.'\"  Id.

We have no doubt\n\nthat Rule 15(c) is not designed to remedy such mistakes.\n\n          To the extent that  Wilson raises any other issues,\n\nhe  does so  in  a perfunctory  manner,  with no  attempt  at\n\ndeveloped argumentation.   Such issues may  be deemed waived.\n\nSee Romero  Lama v.

The amended complaint sought damages under the Public Vessels Act and the Suits in Admiralty Act, both of which carry a two-year statute of limitations.  The district court dismissed the claims as time-barred, declining to apply either equitable tolling, or Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)'s \"relation back\" provisions.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1988, Wilson, an employee of General Electric Government Services, Inc.  (hereinafter \"GEGS\"), whose job entailed maintaining a fleet of Seaborne Powered Target Boats (hereinafter \"SEPTARs\") for the United States Navy, was sent to sea by GEGS, along with several other employees, in a SEPTAR.  Wilson and the other crew members became stranded in Hurricane Gilbert and required rescue by the Coast Guard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1988, and again on November 23, 1988, counsel for Wilson wrote to United States Navy officials requesting transcripts of radio communications recorded during the stranding incident.  Counsel also requested the results of any Navy investigations regarding the incident.  These letters did not allude in any manner to the possibility that the United States might be a party in any capacity to any legal proceeding.  In fact, at the time the requests were sent, no complaint against any party had yet been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1989, almost a year after these requests to the Navy, Wilson and other crew members filed suit against GEGS under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. Sec. 688, for injuries allegedly suffered in the stranding incident.  The United States received no notice of these suits, nor was the United States, or any of its departments or agencies, named as a party.  On April 2, 1990, GEGS moved for summary judgment, arguing that the United States Navy owned the SEPTAR on which Wilson and the others were injured, and that therefore the United States was the only proper party in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to GEGS's motion for summary judgment, Wilson filed a motion on June 8, 1990, requesting that GEGS be dismissed from the suit and that the United States be substituted as defendant.  On June 19, 1990, the district court dismissed GEGS from the suit and granted Wilson's motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court had granted leave for Wilson to amend his complaint, more than two months elapsed and Wilson had still not filed an amended complaint.  On September 10, 1990, two years to the day after the stranding incident, the court notified Wilson that he had until September 24, 1990, i.e., fourteen days from the date of the order, to file an amended complaint, or the action would be dismissed for lack of prosecution.  It is important to note that when the court issued this deadline, the United States had received no notice that it would be named a party to the suit and the amended complaint had not yet been filed.  Thus, as far as the record indicates, no statute of limitations issue was before the district court when it set the September 24, 1990, deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint was filed on September 25, 1990,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the day after the deadline imposed by the district court.  It alleged liability under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. Secs. 781-90 and the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. Secs. 741-52.  Suits under these statutes carry a two-year statute of limitations.  Along with the amended complaint, Wilson filed a motion requesting the court to \"relate back\" the filing date of the amended complaint to that of the original complaint.  The United States was not served with the complaint until November 16, 1990, fifty-two days after the amended complaint was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 8, 1991, the United States moved to dismiss the action as time-barred.  The matter was then referred to a magistrate who found that Wilson had indeed missed the two-year statute of limitations and had provided no basis for either relating back the filing date of the amended complaint, or for equitably tolling the limitations period.  On June 30, 1993, the district court adopted the magistrate's findings and dismissed the action as time-barred.  Wilson appeals from this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act apply when a plaintiff brings a \"public-vessel-related suit in admiralty against the United States.\"  Justice v. United States, 6 F.3d 1474, 1475 (11th Cir.1993).  Causes of action under both Acts \"may be brought only within two years after the cause of action arises.\"  46 U.S.C. Sec. 745.  A cause of action \"arises\" under both Acts on the date of injury.  See, e.g., McMahon v. United States, 342 U.S. 25, 27, 72 S.Ct. 17, 19, 96 L.Ed. 26 (1951) (\"[W]e think it clear that the proper construction of the language used in the Suits in Admiralty Act is that the period of limitation is to be computed from the date of the injury.\");  Justice, 6 F.3d at 1475 (stating that the Public Vessels Act incorporates the statute of limitations of the Suits in Admiralty Act).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the original complaint against GEGS was timely filed, nor can it be disputed that the amended complaint which named the United States as a party was first filed more than two years after the date of injury.  Wilson offers two grounds for arguing that the amended complaint should nonetheless be viewed as timely.  First, Wilson argues that the two-year statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.  Second, he argues that the amended complaint should be deemed to \"relate back\" to the date of filing of the original complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).  We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Equitable Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts have allowed equitable tolling only sparingly.  Irwin v. Veterans Admin., 498 U.S. 89, 94, 111 S.Ct. 453, 457, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).  For example, such tolling has been allowed where the claimant actively pursued a timely yet defective pleading, or where the complainant was tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing a deadline to pass.  See id. at 96, nn. 3 &amp; 4, 111 S.Ct. at 457-58 nn. 3 &amp; 4 (compiling cases).  Where, on the other hand, \" 'the claimant [fails] to exercise due diligence in preserving his[/her] legal rights,' courts are reluctant to apply principles of equitable tolling to extend a federal limitations period.\"  De Casenave v. United States, 991 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Wilson's failure at more than one juncture to exercise due diligence proves fatal to his request for equitable tolling.  First, Wilson asks us to toll the statute of limitations because he purportedly was unaware at the time he filed suit that the United States, rather than GEGS, owned the SEPTAR on which he was injured.  He further states that GEGS's delay in filing a motion for summary judgment on these grounds caused undue delay in determining the ownership of the SEPTAR, which in turn warrants equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate's report points out, however, that the ownership of the SEPTAR easily could and should have been determined through routine discovery.  Wilson offers no evidence to the contrary.  Nor does he allege any trickery or other questionable motive on the part of GEGS.  In fact, there is no evidence in the record tending to show that GEGS was dilatory in alerting the district court that the United States owned the SEPTAR.  Similarly, there is no record evidence showing that Wilson made any attempt to ascertain who owned the SEPTAR, nor is there any evidence that Wilson pursued discovery on this, or any other issue in this case.  In sum, nothing in the record controverts the magistrate's finding that the issue of ownership could have been made known through routine discovery procedures.  Thus, we see no reason to toll the statute of limitations based on the actions of GEGS in this case.  Cf. Favorite v. Marine Personnel and Provisioning, Inc., 955 F.2d 382, 388 (5th Cir.1992) (declining to equitably toll two-year statute of limitations under the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act where plaintiff \"waited to bring suit only because he believed he could sue ... his private employer[ ] under the three-year statute of limitations in the Jones Act\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important than Wilson's initial failure to ascertain the identity of the SEPTAR's owner, however, is the fact that Wilson did learn of the actual ownership of the SEPTAR more than five months before the statute of limitations expired, i.e., when GEGS filed its motion for summary judgment.  Still, Wilson did not amend his complaint.  In fact, Wilson filed the amended complaint only after the district court threatened to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution.  Wilson offers no reason or excuse for this delay.  We see no basis for extending the exceptional doctrine of equitable tolling to a party who, by all accounts, merely failed to exercise his rights.  Cf. Puleio v.

In sum, the record before us reflects that Wilson failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim, and thus we see no grounds for applying the doctrine of equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. \"Relation Back\" Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson's claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) fares no better.  When a plaintiff amends a complaint to add a defendant, but the plaintiff does so subsequent to the running of the relevant statute of limitations, then Rule 15(c)(3) controls whether the amended complaint may \"relate back\" to the filing of the original complaint and thereby escape a timeliness objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that Wilson failed to meet one of Rule 15(c)(3)'s mechanical requirements, namely, that, within 120 days of the filing of the original complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"the party to be brought in by amendment ... received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The record shows that the United States received notice of this action no earlier than November 16, 1990, the date that it was served with the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that the United States nonetheless had adequate notice of the claim against GEGS, Wilson points only to his counsel's requests for radio transcripts and investigation results from the Navy.  These requests occurred some nine months prior to the institution of the action against GEGS.  Moreover, the correspondence does not advert, formally or informally, to the institution of any action against the United States or any other party.  Accordingly, we find no means in the record to conclude that the United States ever received timely notice of the institution of the suit against GEGS.  Without this timely notice, Rule 15(c)(3)'s relation back provisions cannot apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional requirement for relation back under Rule 15(c)(3) is that the party to be added by amendment \"knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\"   There is no basis for imputing such knowledge to the United States on the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Seventh Circuit has recently reiterated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>\"amendment [of a complaint] with relation back is generally permitted in order to correct a misnomer of a defendant where the proper defendant is already before the court and the effect is merely to correct the name under which he is sued.

Put another way, Rule 15(c)(3) \" 'permits an amendment to relate back only where there has been an error made concerning the identity of the proper party and where that party is chargeable with knowledge of the mistake, but it does not permit relation back where, as here, there is a lack of knowledge of the proper party.' \"  Id.

Rather, Wilson merely lacked knowledge of the proper party.  In other words, Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS, he did so, and GEGS turned out to be the wrong party.

Furthermore, the amended complaint included in the Wilson's appendix is date stamped by the clerk's office \"1990 SEP 25 AM 9:51.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Public Vessels Act incorporates provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act, \"insofar as the same are not inconsistent\" with the Public Vessels Act.  46 U.S.C.

Marine Personnel and Provisioning, Inc., 955 F.2d 382, 385, 388-89 (5th Cir.1992) (applying Suits in Admiralty Act's two-year limitation in case involving claims under both the Public Vessels Act and Suits in Admiralty Act).  Wilson's brief alludes vaguely to the notion that the two-year statute of limitations in the Public Vessels Act operates in a manner different from the statute of limitations in the Suits in Admiralty Act.  We have found no support for this argument, either in the statutes themselves or in the cases interpreting these statutes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 15(c) states:</p>\n        <p>An Amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>\n        <p>(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>\n        <p>(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>\n        <p>(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>\n        <p>The delivery or mailing of process to the United States Attorney, or United States Attorney's designee, or the Attorney General of the United States, or an agency or officer who would have been a proper defendant if named, satisfies the requirement of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3) with respect to the United States or any agency or officer thereof to be brought into the action as a defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), cited in Rule 15(c), states:</p>\n        <p>If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time;  provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.

We stated there that \"the institution of the action serves as constructive notice of the action to the parties added after the limitations period expired, when the original and added parties are so closely related in business or other activities that it is fair to presume the added parties learned of the institution of the action shortly after it was commenced.\"  Id.  To support his argument that the United States had such constructive notice in this case, Wilson cites only the contract between the Navy and GEGS which governed the operation of the SEPTARs.  Without more, this contract does not permit a conclusion that the United States and GEGS were so closely related in business that the United States can be presumed to have received notice of the case against GEGS, nor does any other record evidence support such a conclusion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The amended complaint sought damages under the Public Vessels Act and the Suits in Admiralty Act, both of which carry a two-year statute of limitations.  The district court dismissed the claims as time-barred, declining to apply either equitable tolling, or Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)'s \"relation back\" provisions.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1988, Wilson, an employee of General Electric Government Services, Inc.  (hereinafter \"GEGS\"), whose job entailed maintaining a fleet of Seaborne Powered Target Boats (hereinafter \"SEPTARs\") for the United States Navy, was sent to sea by GEGS, along with several other employees, in a SEPTAR.  Wilson and the other crew members became stranded in Hurricane Gilbert and required rescue by the Coast Guard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1988, and again on November 23, 1988, counsel for Wilson wrote to United States Navy officials requesting transcripts of radio communications recorded during the stranding incident.  Counsel also requested the results of any Navy investigations regarding the incident.  These letters did not allude in any manner to the possibility that the United States might be a party in any capacity to any legal proceeding.  In fact, at the time the requests were sent, no complaint against any party had yet been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1989, almost a year after these requests to the Navy, Wilson and other crew members filed suit against GEGS under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. Sec. 688, for injuries allegedly suffered in the stranding incident.  The United States received no notice of these suits, nor was the United States, or any of its departments or agencies, named as a party.  On April 2, 1990, GEGS moved for summary judgment, arguing that the United States Navy owned the SEPTAR on which Wilson and the others were injured, and that therefore the United States was the only proper party in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to GEGS's motion for summary judgment, Wilson filed a motion on June 8, 1990, requesting that GEGS be dismissed from the suit and that the United States be substituted as defendant.  On June 19, 1990, the district court dismissed GEGS from the suit and granted Wilson's motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court had granted leave for Wilson to amend his complaint, more than two months elapsed and Wilson had still not filed an amended complaint.  On September 10, 1990, two years to the day after the stranding incident, the court notified Wilson that he had until September 24, 1990, i.e., fourteen days from the date of the order, to file an amended complaint, or the action would be dismissed for lack of prosecution.  It is important to note that when the court issued this deadline, the United States had received no notice that it would be named a party to the suit and the amended complaint had not yet been filed.  Thus, as far as the record indicates, no statute of limitations issue was before the district court when it set the September 24, 1990, deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint was filed on September 25, 1990,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the day after the deadline imposed by the district court.  It alleged liability under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. Secs. 781-90 and the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. Secs. 741-52.  Suits under these statutes carry a two-year statute of limitations.  Along with the amended complaint, Wilson filed a motion requesting the court to \"relate back\" the filing date of the amended complaint to that of the original complaint.  The United States was not served with the complaint until November 16, 1990, fifty-two days after the amended complaint was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 8, 1991, the United States moved to dismiss the action as time-barred.  The matter was then referred to a magistrate who found that Wilson had indeed missed the two-year statute of limitations and had provided no basis for either relating back the filing date of the amended complaint, or for equitably tolling the limitations period.  On June 30, 1993, the district court adopted the magistrate's findings and dismissed the action as time-barred.  Wilson appeals from this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act apply when a plaintiff brings a \"public-vessel-related suit in admiralty against the United States.\"  Justice v.

Causes of action under both Acts \"may be brought only within two years after the cause of action arises.\"  46 U.S.C. Sec. 745.  A cause of action \"arises\" under both Acts on the date of injury.

Wilson offers two grounds for arguing that the amended complaint should nonetheless be viewed as timely.  First, Wilson argues that the two-year statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.  Second, he argues that the amended complaint should be deemed to \"relate back\" to the date of filing of the original complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).  We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Equitable Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts have allowed equitable tolling only sparingly.  Irwin v. Veterans Admin., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span> (1990).  For example, such tolling has been allowed where the claimant actively pursued a timely yet defective pleading, or where the complainant was tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing a deadline to pass.  See id. at 96, nn. 3 &amp; 4, 111 S.Ct. at 457-58 nn. 3 &amp; 4 (compiling cases).  Where, on the other hand, \" 'the claimant [fails] to exercise due diligence in preserving his[/her] legal rights,' courts are reluctant to apply principles of equitable tolling to extend a federal limitations period.\"  De Casenave v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604817\"><a href=\"/opinion/604817/miguel-de-casenave-and-maria-angelica-morales-de-casenave-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Wilson's failure at more than one juncture to exercise due diligence proves fatal to his request for equitable tolling.  First, Wilson asks us to toll the statute of limitations because he purportedly was unaware at the time he filed suit that the United States, rather than GEGS, owned the SEPTAR on which he was injured.  He further states that GEGS's delay in filing a motion for summary judgment on these grounds caused undue delay in determining the ownership of the SEPTAR, which in turn warrants equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate's report points out, however, that the ownership of the SEPTAR easily could and should have been determined through routine discovery.  Wilson offers no evidence to the contrary.  Nor does he allege any trickery or other questionable motive on the part of GEGS.  In fact, there is no evidence in the record tending to show that GEGS was dilatory in alerting the district court that the United States owned the SEPTAR.  Similarly, there is no record evidence showing that Wilson made any attempt to ascertain who owned the SEPTAR, nor is there any evidence that Wilson pursued discovery on this, or any other issue in this case.  In sum, nothing in the record controverts the magistrate's finding that the issue of ownership could have been made known through routine discovery procedures.  Thus, we see no reason to toll the statute of limitations based on the actions of GEGS in this case.  Cf. Favorite v. Marine Personnel and Provisioning, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577049\"><a href=\"/opinion/577049/clifton-favorite-v-marine-personnel-and-provisioning-inc-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 388 (5th Cir.1992) (declining to equitably toll two-year statute of limitations under the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act where plaintiff \"waited to bring suit only because he believed he could sue ... his private employer[ ] under the three-year statute of limitations in the Jones Act\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More important than Wilson's initial failure to ascertain the identity of the SEPTAR's owner, however, is the fact that Wilson did learn of the actual ownership of the SEPTAR more than five months before the statute of limitations expired, i.e., when GEGS filed its motion for summary judgment.  Still, Wilson did not amend his complaint.  In fact, Wilson filed the amended complaint only after the district court threatened to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution.  Wilson offers no reason or excuse for this delay.  We see no basis for extending the exceptional doctrine of equitable tolling to a party who, by all accounts, merely failed to exercise his rights.  Cf. Puleio v. Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495428\"><a href=\"/opinion/495428/joseph-a-puleio-v-george-a-vose-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1203 (1st Cir.1987) (\"The law ministers to the vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In sum, the record before us reflects that Wilson failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim, and thus we see no grounds for applying the doctrine of equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. \"Relation Back\" Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson's claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) fares no better.  When a plaintiff amends a complaint to add a defendant, but the plaintiff does so subsequent to the running of the relevant statute of limitations, then Rule 15(c)(3) controls whether the amended complaint may \"relate back\" to the filing of the original complaint and thereby escape a timeliness objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that Wilson failed to meet one of Rule 15(c)(3)'s mechanical requirements, namely, that, within 120 days of the filing of the original complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"the party to be brought in by amendment ... received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The record shows that the United States received notice of this action no earlier than November 16, 1990, the date that it was served with the amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that the United States nonetheless had adequate notice of the claim against GEGS, Wilson points only to his counsel's requests for radio transcripts and investigation results from the Navy.  These requests occurred some nine months prior to the institution of the action against GEGS.  Moreover, the correspondence does not advert, formally or informally, to the institution of any action against the United States or any other party.  Accordingly, we find no means in the record to conclude that the United States ever received timely notice of the institution of the suit against GEGS.  Without this timely notice, Rule 15(c)(3)'s relation back provisions cannot apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional requirement for relation back under Rule 15(c)(3) is that the party to be added by amendment \"knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.\"   There is no basis for imputing such knowledge to the United States on the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Seventh Circuit has recently reiterated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>\"amendment [of a complaint] with relation back is generally permitted in order to correct a misnomer of a defendant where the proper defendant is already before the court and the effect is merely to correct the name under which he is sued.  But a new defendant cannot normally be substituted or added by amendment after the statute of limitations has run.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Worthington v.

Put another way, Rule 15(c)(3) \" 'permits an amendment to relate back only where there has been an error made concerning the identity of the proper party and where that party is chargeable with knowledge of the mistake, but it does not permit relation back where, as here, there is a lack of knowledge of the proper party.' \"  Id.

Rather, Wilson merely lacked knowledge of the proper party.  In other words, Wilson fully intended to sue GEGS, he did so, and GEGS turned out to be the wrong party.  We have no doubt that Rule 15(c) is not designed to remedy such mistakes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Wilson raises any other issues, he does so in a perfunctory manner, with no attempt at developed argumentation.  Such issues may be deemed waived.  See Romero Lama v.

The court docket and the magistrate's report, however, both list September 25, 1990 as the filing date of the amended complaint.  Furthermore, the amended complaint included in the Wilson's appendix is date stamped by the clerk's office \"1990 SEP 25 AM 9:51.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Public Vessels Act incorporates provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act, \"insofar as the same are not inconsistent\" with the Public Vessels Act.  46 U.S.C. Sec. 782.  This includes the two-year statute of limitations.  See, e.g., Justice, 6 F.3d at 1475;  Favorite v.

Wilson's brief alludes vaguely to the notion that the two-year statute of limitations in the Public Vessels Act operates in a manner different from the statute of limitations in the Suits in Admiralty Act.  We have found no support for this argument, either in the statutes themselves or in the cases interpreting these statutes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 15(c) states:</p>\n        <p>An Amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>\n        <p>(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>\n        <p>(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>\n        <p>(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>\n        <p>The delivery or mailing of process to the United States Attorney, or United States Attorney's designee, or the Attorney General of the United States, or an agency or officer who would have been a proper defendant if named, satisfies the requirement of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3) with respect to the United States or any agency or officer thereof to be brought into the action as a defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), cited in Rule 15(c), states:</p>\n        <p>If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time;  provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.

Calero Toledo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369073\"><a href=\"/opinion/369073/francisco-hernandez-jimenez-v-astol-calero-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 102-03 (1st Cir.1979).  We stated there that \"the institution of the action serves as constructive notice of the action to the parties added after the limitations period expired, when the original and added parties are so closely related in business or other activities that it is fair to presume the added parties learned of the institution of the action shortly after it was commenced.\"  Id.  To support his argument that the United States had such constructive notice in this case, Wilson cites only the contract between the Navy and GEGS which governed the operation of the SEPTARs.  Without more, this contract does not permit a conclusion that the United States and GEGS were so closely related in business that the United States can be presumed to have received notice of the case against GEGS, nor does any other record evidence support such a conclusion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
