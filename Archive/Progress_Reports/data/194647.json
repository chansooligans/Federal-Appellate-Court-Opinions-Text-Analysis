Plaintiff Richard Street, an inmate at MCI-\n               \n\nCedar Junction in Massachusetts, was charged in 1990 with two\n\ndisciplinary offenses.   After conducting  separate hearings,\n\nprison officials in each  instance found plaintiff guilty and\n\nimposed a  sanction of isolation time.   Plaintiff thereafter\n\nfiled these pro se  actions under 42 U.S.C.    1983, alleging\n\nthat the two disciplinary hearings suffered from assorted due\n\nprocess violations.    He requested  relief  in the  form  of\n\ndamages and  the removal  of the  offenses  from his  record.\n\nNamed as defendants were  the prison superintendent and other\n\ncorrectional  officials.   In  both  cases, over  plaintiff's\n\nopposition, the  district court granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss  under Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6).   Plaintiff  now\n\nappeals.                      I.\n\n     Plaintiff advances the  following factual  allegations.1\n\nAppeal No. 92-1927 involves  an incident on June 18,  1990 in\n\nwhich plaintiff is alleged to have destroyed a light fixture.\n\nWilliam  Cabino,  the  reporting  staff  person,  prepared  a\n\ndisciplinary  report stating  as follows:  (1) at  6:55 a.m.,\n\nCabino  was directed to remove plaintiff from a security cell\n\n                    \n\n1.  The   factual  allegations  are  drawn  from  plaintiff's\nverified complaints and the exhibits  attached thereto (which\nconsist of the  records of the disciplinary  hearings).  Such\nexhibits are considered  part of the  complaint, see Fed.  R.\n                                                    \nCiv. P. 10(c), and may properly be reviewed when evaluating a\nmotion to dismiss  under Rule 12(b)(6).  See,  e.g., Hamilton\n                                                             \nv. O'Leary, 976  F.2d 341,  343 (7th Cir.  1992); O'Brien  v.\n                                                         \nDiGrazia,  544  F.2d 543,  545  n.1  (1st Cir.  1976),  cert.\n                                                             \ndenied, 431 U.S. 914 (1977).\n      \n\n\"due to his disruptive behavior\"; (2) upon entering the cell,\n\nhe noticed that a lighting fixture had been broken; and (3) a\n\nsubsequent  search  uncovered  a  five-inch  piece  of  metal\n\nlocated under a mattress and a \"large piece of glass\" located\n\nunder the  toilet, both  of which  \"apparently came  from the\n\nlighting  fixture.\"   Plaintiff  was charged  with four  code\n\noffenses  under   103  C.M.R.     430.24   (1987),  including\n\npossession  of  a weapon  and  willful  destruction of  state\n\nproperty.  \n\n     At the disciplinary hearing, which was  held on June 28,\n\n1990,  plaintiff pled not guilty  by reason of  insanity.  In\n\nhis complaint, he alleges that he submitted a written request\n\nfor  two   witnesses--Cabino  and   Dr.  Navaras,   a  prison\n\npsychiatrist--but  that a  correctional official  (Lt. Ayala)\n\ntore up the witness form in plaintiff's presence.  The record\n\nof  the hearing contains a  partial reference to this matter,\n\nexplaining the denial of plaintiff's request for  witness(es)\n\nas follows:\n\n     Request   for   witness  Dr.   Navaras   denied  in\n     accordance  with  CMR   430.11(4).[2]    Failed  to\n     submit  witness form.   Inmate  Street claimed  Lt.\n     Ayala tore it up.   Lt. Ayala states he  never tore\n     it up.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under 103 C.M.R.    430.11(1), an inmate is to  be served\nwith a \"request for witness form\" within twenty-four hours of\nthe  designation of the offense  as a major  matter.  Section\n430.11(4)  in  turn provides  that  an  inmate's \"failure  to\nsubmit  a request for ... witness form may, in the discretion\nof the disciplinary board chairperson, constitute a waiver of\nthe inmate's rights to call witnesses.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nThe record also  contains a notation  that plaintiff did  not\n\nrequest  Cabino's  presence.    Admitted  into evidence  were\n\nCabino's  disciplinary report  and  the pieces  of metal  and\n\nglass recovered from the  cell.  Based on such  evidence, the\n\ndisciplinary board  found plaintiff guilty of both possessing\n\na weapon and destroying property.  He was given a sanction of\n\nfifteen  days in  isolation on  each charge,  for a  total of\n\nthirty  days.     Plaintiff   appealed  the  matter   to  the\n\nsuperintendent,  claiming  that  his   so-called  \"disruptive\n\nbehavior\"  had  in  fact  been  a suicide  attempt,  that  he\n\nsuffered  from \"severe mental illness,\" and that he should be\n\ntransferred to a hospital.  Plaintiff alleges that his appeal\n\nwas denied without explanation.\n\n     Appeal No. 92-1928 involves  an unrelated incident which\n\nallegedly  occurred one  day  later.   A disciplinary  report\n\nprepared by staff  person John Lopes stated: \"On 6/19/90 ...,\n\nthis officer did see  Inmate R.A. Street run from  the Mental\n\nHealth office to the  Hospital ward grill and spit  on Inmate\n\nJohn Debella  ....\"  Plaintiff was  subsequently charged with\n\ndisruptive conduct  and \"assaulting  ... another  person with\n\nany offense  against his person.\"   103 C.M.R.    430.24(18).\n\nAt  a disciplinary  hearing held on  July 5,  1990, plaintiff\n\nagain  pled   not  guilty  by  reason   of  insanity,  adding\n\n(according to the  hearing record)  that he had  been at  the\n\nhealth unit to see a psychiatrist due to an episode of mental\n\n                             -4-\n\nillness, and  that he did  not recall the  incident.   In his\n\ncomplaint, plaintiff alleges that he requested two witnesses-\n\n-Lopes and  Dr. Navaras.   The hearing record  indicates that\n\nLopes' presence was initially  requested but was later waived\n\nby   plaintiff  (an   assertion  plaintiff   denies   in  his\n\ncomplaint).   The  disciplinary board  denied the  request to\n\ncall  Dr. Navaras on the ground that \"witness was not present\n\nat  the  incident.\"    Based on  Lopes'  written  report, the\n\ndisciplinary  board  found  plaintiff  guilty  and imposed  a\n\nsanction  of  fifteen  days  isolation.   On  appeal  to  the\n\nsuperintendent, plaintiff argued that he had had a \"psychotic\n\nepisode ... I  was hallucinating and thought  [Debella] was a\n\ndevil about to attack me, so I spat on him to break his  evil\n\nspell.\"   This appeal, according  to the complaint,  was also\n\ndenied without explanation.\n\n                             II.\n\n     In  his pair  of  complaints, plaintiff  advanced nearly\n\nidentical challenges  to these two  disciplinary proceedings.\n\nHe argued that the  following due process violations occurred\n\nin  each instance: (1)  inadequate notice of  the charges was\n\nprovided;  (2) he  was denied  the right  to call  and cross-\n\nexamine  witnesses;  (3)  the  conviction was  not  based  on\n\nsubstantial evidence; (4) the board failed to reach a finding\n\nafter  the close  of the  evidence; and  (5) no  reasons were\n\nprovided  for  the denial  of his  appeal.   He  charged that\n\n                             -5-\n\nimposing multiple  sanctions for  a single act  of misconduct\n\nviolated  double   jeopardy.    He  argued   that  the  board\n\ncontravened  \"common  law\"  by  (1) basing  its  findings  on\n\nunsupported written testimony and  (2) failing to explain its\n\ncredibility findings.   And  he contended that  each incident\n\nwas attributable to the negligent supervision of defendants--\n\nconduct which in No. 92-1927, at least, amounted to cruel and\n\nunusual  punishment.  The  district court found  that none of\n\nthese allegations presented a federal claim  cognizable under\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983.  \n\n     Appellate review  of a dismissal under  Rule 12(b)(6) is\n\nplenary.   See, e.g., Miranda v. Ponce Federal Bank, 948 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n41, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).  We must accept all well-pled factual\n\nallegations  as  true  and  draw  all  reasonable  inferences\n\ntherefrom  in plaintiff's  favor.   See, e.g.,  Leatherman v.\n                                                          \n\nTarrant County Narcotics, Etc.  Unit, 61 U.S.L.W. 4205, 4206-\n                                    \n\n07 (U.S. March 3, 1993); Roth v. United States, 952 F.2d 611,\n                                              \n\n613 (1st  Cir. 1991); Dartmouth Review  v. Dartmouth College,\n                                                            \n\n889  F.2d 13,  16 (1st  Cir. 1989).   In  addition, a  pro se\n\ncomplaint is  held to  \"less stringent standards  than formal\n\npleadings drafted  by lawyers\" and  can only be  dismissed if\n\n\"it appears 'beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set\n\nof  facts in support of his  claim which would entitle him to\n\nrelief.'\"   Haines v. Kerner,  404 U.S. 519,  520 (1972) (per\n                            \n\ncuriam)  (quoting  Conley  v.  Gibson,  355  U.S.  41,  45-46\n                                     \n\n                             -6-\n\n(1957)); accord, e.g.,  Estelle v. Gamble,  429 U.S. 97,  106\n                                         \n\n(1976).\n\n     Our task  is to  determine not whether  the disciplinary\n\nhearings   comported   in  every   detail   with  the   state\n\nregulations,  but  whether  they  were  consistent  with  the\n\n\"minimal safeguards afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment.\"   Ponte v.  Real, 471  U.S.  491, 495\n                                        \n\n(1985).3  \"Prison disciplinary proceedings are not  part of a\n\ncriminal prosecution,  and the full  panoply of rights  due a\n\ndefendant  in  such proceedings  does not  apply.\"   Wolff v.\n                                                          \n\nMcDonnell,  418 U.S.  539, 556  (1974).   As outlined  by the\n         \n\nCourt  in  Wolff,  the applicable  constitutional  safeguards\n                \n\ninclude  the  following:  providing \"written  notice  of  the\n\ncharges\"  to the inmate at least 24 hours before the hearing,\n\nid. at  564;  allowing  the  inmate \"to  call  witnesses  and\n   \n\npresent  documentary evidence in  his defense when permitting\n\nhim  to do so will  not be unduly  hazardous to institutional\n\nsafety or  correctional goals,\"  id. at  566;  and, should  a\n                                    \n\nfinding of  guilt be reached, providing  \"a written statement\n\nby the factfinders as  to the evidence relied on  and reasons\n\nfor the disciplinary action,\" id. at 564 (quotation omitted);\n                                 \n\naccord,  e.g.,   Superintendent,  Massachusetts  Correctional\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n3.  It  is  clear  that  the  loss  of  liberty  entailed  in\nisolation time suffices to trigger constitutional safeguards.\nSee, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 571 n.19 (1974);\n                             \nSmith  v. Mass.

His\n\ncontention that he received  inadequate notice of the charges\n\nis entirely  conclusory.   The hearing records  indicate (and\n\nplaintiff  does not dispute) that he was afforded at least 24\n\nhours  advance notice.   In  particular, he does  not dispute\n\nthat  he  received  copies  of the  disciplinary  reports  in\n\nadvance,  in  which the  charges  were adequately  described.\n\nPlaintiff likewise presents no cognizable claim in contending\n\nthat defendants violated double jeopardy by imposing multiple\n\npunishments for  a single act of  misconduct.  As we  said in\n\nrejecting an analogous double jeopardy  contention in Langton\n                                                             \n\nv. Berman,  667  F.2d  231 (1st  Cir.  1981),  this  argument\n         \n\n\"fail[s] to  appreciate the essential  differences between  a\n\ndisciplinary hearing  and a  criminal trial.\"    Id. at  234;\n                                                    \n\naccord, e.g., United  States v. Rising,  867 F.2d 1255,  1259\n                                      \n\n(10th Cir. 1989); see generally Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519,\n                                              \n\n528   (1975)   (\"jeopardy   describes  the   risk   that   is\n\ntraditionally associated with a criminal prosecution\").  \n\n     Plaintiff's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nis  clearly meritless.  It is plain that the board's findings\n\nwere supported by \"some evidence in the record\"--the standard\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  evidentiary  sufficiency  mandated  by  the  Due  Process\n\nClause.  Hill,  472 U.S. at 454.   Nor has he  stated a claim\n             \n\nwith respect to (1) the board's consideration of the evidence\n\nor  (2) its description of  the evidence on  which it relied.\n\nThe  Wolff   Court  held   that  \"confrontation  and   cross-\n          \n\nexamination\" are  not \"generally  required\" in  this context.\n\n418 U.S. at 568.   Consequently, the board's reliance  on the\n\nwritten  disciplinary reports was  proper, particularly since\n\neach report  contained an eyewitness account.   In explaining\n\nits  findings,  the board  indicated that  it relied  on \"the\n\neyewitness testimony as recorded  in the officer's report\" in\n\neach  case and, in No.  92-1927, on the  physical evidence as\n\nwell.  Such summary  explanations have been deemed sufficient\n\nin  other cases  (depending on  the facts  presented).   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d 308, 318-19 (7th Cir. 1992),\n                      \n\ncert.  denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3456  (Feb. 22, 1993).   They were\n             \n\nclearly adequate under the  circumstances here.  The evidence\n\nat  the  hearings  was  straightforward.    And  rather  than\n\nattempting  to controvert  the  central  factual  allegations\n\nunderlying the charges, plaintiff sought to defend himself by\n\nciting the collateral issue  of his mental status.4   For the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Plaintiff's  challenge  to  the superintendent's  alleged\nfailure  to  explain  his  reasons for  denying  the  appeals\nsimilarly  falters.   No  such obligation  is imposed  by the\nstate regulations.  See 103 C.M.R.    430.18.  And we find no\n                       \nsuch obligation  as a  constitutional matter, given  that the\nboard adequately explained its findings.\n\n                             -9-\n\nsame  reason,  no issue  of credibility  was presented  as to\n\nwhether plaintiff  actually committed the acts  with which he\n\nwas charged.\n\n     The issue of plaintiff's requests to call Dr. Navaras as\n\na  witness  deserves closer  scrutiny.5    As mentioned,  the\n\nCourt in Wolff held that an inmate \"should be allowed to call\n              \n\nwitnesses ... in  his defense  when permitting him  to do  so\n\nwill  not  be unduly  hazardous  to  institutional safety  or\n\ncorrectional goals.\"  418 U.S.  at 566.  In Ponte, the  Court\n                                                 \n\nclarified that prison officials have the burden of justifying\n\nthe  denial of a witness request by tendering an explanation,\n\neither  during the  administrative hearing  or  in connection\n\nwith  subsequent litigation.    471 U.S.  at 497-99;  accord,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Smith, 936 F.2d at 1399-1400.  This rule is intended to\n           \n\nguard against arbitrary action by  requiring prison officials\n\n\"to explain, in  a limited manner,  the reason why  witnesses\n\nwere  not allowed  to  testify.\"   Ponte,  471 U.S.  at  497.\n                                        \n\nReasonable  explanations include not only interests of prison\n\nsafety  and  discipline, but  also  legitimate administrative\n\nconcerns.   See,  e.g.,  Wolff,  418  U.S.  at  566  (\"Prison\n                              \n\n                    \n\n5.  By contrast,  no colorable claim  is presented  regarding\nplaintiff's  alleged  requests to  call  the  authors of  the\ndisciplinary  reports  as  witnesses.    Even  if  we  assume\n(contrary to  the notations in the hearing records) that such\nrequests  were made,  prison officials  are not  required \"to\nprovide reasons in writing to inmates denied the privilege to\n...   confront  witnesses   against   them  in   disciplinary\nproceedings.\"    Baxter  v.  Palmigiano, 425  U.S.  308,  322\n                                       \n(1976); accord Wolff, 418 U.S. at 567-69.  \n                    \n\n                             -10-\n\nofficials  must have  the  necessary discretion  to keep  the\n\nhearing within reasonable limits  ....\"); Ramer v.

And  in general, courts \"should\n\nnot  be too  ready to  exercise oversight  and put  aside the\n\njudgment of  prison administrators\"  in this regard.   Wolff,\n                                                            \n\n418 U.S. at 566.   \n\n     We agree with the lower court  that plaintiff has failed\n\nto  state a  viable  claim under  these  standards.   In  the\n\nassault  case,  the board  denied  the  request to  have  Dr.\n\nNavaras testify on the ground that he \"was not present at the\n\nincident.\"     We   cannot  say   that  this   rationale  was\n\nunreasonable.   Cf. Powell v. Coughlin, 953 F.2d 744, 751 (2d\n                                      \n\nCir. 1991) (board's refusal  to allow psychiatrist to testify\n\nwas  proper since he \"was not an observer of disputed factual\n\nissues  concerning the  underlying incident\"; receipt  of his\n\nnotes  in lieu of his testimony \"was harmless error, if error\n\nat  all\").  To  be sure, Dr.  Navaras (apparently plaintiff's\n\ntreating psychiatrist) likely would have been able to provide\n\nbackground  information  as  to  plaintiff's  mental  health,\n\nperhaps   even  as  to   his  susceptibility   to  \"psychotic\n\nepisodes.\"    Yet  under  the  rather  unusual  circumstances\n\npresented (with an inmate  personally proclaiming that he had\n\n                             -11-\n\nbeen \"insane\"  two weeks  earlier), any such  testimony would\n\nhave  been of  marginal relevance,  and would  obviously have\n\nexpanded the scope of the hearing in a manner the board might\n\nreasonably have wished to avoid.  \n\n     In  the  property-destruction  case, the  board  did not\n\npermit  Dr.  Navaras to  testify  because,  according to  the\n\nrecord, plaintiff had failed  to submit the required witness-\n\nrequest  form.   Such  a  rationale  constitutes an  adequate\n\njustification.  See, e.g., Hamilton v. O'Leary, 976 F.2d 341,\n                                              \n\n346-47 (7th Cir. 1992); Smith, 936 F.2d at 1400 (\"denial of a\n                             \n\nrequest to call  a witness on the ground that  the request is\n\nuntimely   is   well    within   the   disciplinary   board's\n\ndiscretion\").     As   mentioned,  plaintiff   disputes  this\n\nconclusion, alleging that he did submit the form but that Lt.\n\nAyala  tore it up.  The  administrative record indicates that\n\nthe  board, after hearing  these differing  explanations from\n\nplaintiff and Ayala, chose to believe the  latter.  Arguably,\n\nthis   credibility   determination,   although  involving   a\n\ncollateral  issue,  is one  subject  to  scrutiny only  under\n\nHill's  \"some  evidence\"  standard--a test  which  \"does  not\n    \n\nrequire  examination   of  the  entire   record,  independent\n\nassessment of  the credibility  of witnesses, or  weighing of\n\nthe evidence.\"   472 U.S. at  455.  We need  not resolve that\n\nissue, however,  since plaintiff's allegation,  even if true,\n\nwould  involve at most harmless  error.  See,  e.g., Elkin v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -12-\n\nFauver, 969 F.2d  48, 53 (3d  Cir.) (applying harmless  error\n      \n\nanalysis  to disciplinary proceedings),  cert. denied, 113 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 473 (1992);  Powell, 953 F.2d at 750-52 (same).   For the\n                       \n\nreasons  discussed  above,  Dr.  Navaras'  testimony  in  the\n\nproperty-destruction case would again have been of negligible\n\nrelevance.   Indeed,  the  fact that  plaintiff  hid the  two\n\n\"weapons\"  in  the  cell--conduct  quite  at  odds  with  any\n\nsuggestion of \"insanity\"--suggests that psychiatric testimony\n\nwould have been even less relevant here.\n\n     For   these  reasons,   we  conclude   that  plaintiff's\n\ncomplaints were properly dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).6\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n6.  As   we  read  the  complaints,  plaintiff's  \"negligent-\nsupervision\" allegations comprise  part of  his challenge  to\nthe disciplinary proceedings, rather  than being intended  as\nindependent  claims for relief.   To the extent  they were so\nintended, we find no suggestion that defendants acted in such\na  \"wanton\" fashion as to have violated the Eighth Amendment.\nWilson v. Seiter, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 2326 (1991).  \n                \n\n                             -13-\n",

Plaintiff Richard Street, an inmate at MCI-\n               \n\nCedar Junction in Massachusetts, was charged in 1990 with two\n\ndisciplinary offenses.   After conducting  separate hearings,\n\nprison officials in each  instance found plaintiff guilty and\n\nimposed a  sanction of isolation time.   Plaintiff thereafter\n\nfiled these pro se  actions under 42 U.S.C.    1983, alleging\n\nthat the two disciplinary hearings suffered from assorted due\n\nprocess violations.    He requested  relief  in the  form  of\n\ndamages and  the removal  of the  offenses  from his  record.\n\nNamed as defendants were  the prison superintendent and other\n\ncorrectional  officials.   In  both  cases, over  plaintiff's\n\nopposition, the  district court granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss  under Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6).   Plaintiff  now\n\nappeals.                      I.\n\n     Plaintiff advances the  following factual  allegations.1\n\nAppeal No. 92-1927 involves  an incident on June 18,  1990 in\n\nwhich plaintiff is alleged to have destroyed a light fixture.\n\nWilliam  Cabino,  the  reporting  staff  person,  prepared  a\n\ndisciplinary  report stating  as follows:  (1) at  6:55 a.m.,\n\nCabino  was directed to remove plaintiff from a security cell\n\n                    \n\n1.  The   factual  allegations  are  drawn  from  plaintiff's\nverified complaints and the exhibits  attached thereto (which\nconsist of the  records of the disciplinary  hearings).  Such\nexhibits are considered  part of the  complaint, see Fed.  R.\n                                                    \nCiv.

In\n\nhis complaint, he alleges that he submitted a written request\n\nfor  two   witnesses--Cabino  and   Dr.  Navaras,   a  prison\n\npsychiatrist--but  that a  correctional official  (Lt. Ayala)\n\ntore up the witness form in plaintiff's presence.  The record\n\nof  the hearing contains a  partial reference to this matter,\n\nexplaining the denial of plaintiff's request for  witness(es)\n\nas follows:\n\n     Request   for   witness  Dr.   Navaras   denied  in\n     accordance  with  CMR   430.11(4).[2]    Failed  to\n     submit  witness form.   Inmate  Street claimed  Lt.\n     Ayala tore it up.   Lt. Ayala states he  never tore\n     it up.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under 103 C.M.R.    430.11(1), an inmate is to  be served\nwith a \"request for witness form\" within twenty-four hours of\nthe  designation of the offense  as a major  matter.  Section\n430.11(4)  in  turn provides  that  an  inmate's \"failure  to\nsubmit  a request for ... witness form may, in the discretion\nof the disciplinary board chairperson, constitute a waiver of\nthe inmate's rights to call witnesses.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nThe record also  contains a notation  that plaintiff did  not\n\nrequest  Cabino's  presence.    Admitted  into evidence  were\n\nCabino's  disciplinary report  and  the pieces  of metal  and\n\nglass recovered from the  cell.  Based on such  evidence, the\n\ndisciplinary board  found plaintiff guilty of both possessing\n\na weapon and destroying property.  He was given a sanction of\n\nfifteen  days in  isolation on  each charge,  for a  total of\n\nthirty  days.     Plaintiff   appealed  the  matter   to  the\n\nsuperintendent,  claiming  that  his   so-called  \"disruptive\n\nbehavior\"  had  in  fact  been  a suicide  attempt,  that  he\n\nsuffered  from \"severe mental illness,\" and that he should be\n\ntransferred to a hospital.  Plaintiff alleges that his appeal\n\nwas denied without explanation.\n\n     Appeal No. 92-1928 involves  an unrelated incident which\n\nallegedly  occurred one  day  later.   A disciplinary  report\n\nprepared by staff  person John Lopes stated: \"On 6/19/90 ...,\n\nthis officer did see  Inmate R.A. Street run from  the Mental\n\nHealth office to the  Hospital ward grill and spit  on Inmate\n\nJohn Debella  ....\"  Plaintiff was  subsequently charged with\n\ndisruptive conduct  and \"assaulting  ... another  person with\n\nany offense  against his person.\"   103 C.M.R.    430.24(18).\n\nAt  a disciplinary  hearing held on  July 5,  1990, plaintiff\n\nagain  pled   not  guilty  by  reason   of  insanity,  adding\n\n(according to the  hearing record)  that he had  been at  the\n\nhealth unit to see a psychiatrist due to an episode of mental\n\n                             -4-\n\nillness, and  that he did  not recall the  incident.   In his\n\ncomplaint, plaintiff alleges that he requested two witnesses-\n\n-Lopes and  Dr. Navaras.   The hearing record  indicates that\n\nLopes' presence was initially  requested but was later waived\n\nby   plaintiff  (an   assertion  plaintiff   denies   in  his\n\ncomplaint).   The  disciplinary board  denied the  request to\n\ncall  Dr. Navaras on the ground that \"witness was not present\n\nat  the  incident.\"    Based on  Lopes'  written  report, the\n\ndisciplinary  board  found  plaintiff  guilty  and imposed  a\n\nsanction  of  fifteen  days  isolation.   On  appeal  to  the\n\nsuperintendent, plaintiff argued that he had had a \"psychotic\n\nepisode ... I  was hallucinating and thought  [Debella] was a\n\ndevil about to attack me, so I spat on him to break his  evil\n\nspell.\"   This appeal, according  to the complaint,  was also\n\ndenied without explanation.\n\n                             II.\n\n     In  his pair  of  complaints, plaintiff  advanced nearly\n\nidentical challenges  to these two  disciplinary proceedings.\n\nHe argued that the  following due process violations occurred\n\nin  each instance: (1)  inadequate notice of  the charges was\n\nprovided;  (2) he  was denied  the right  to call  and cross-\n\nexamine  witnesses;  (3)  the  conviction was  not  based  on\n\nsubstantial evidence; (4) the board failed to reach a finding\n\nafter  the close  of the  evidence; and  (5) no  reasons were\n\nprovided  for  the denial  of his  appeal.   He  charged that\n\n                             -5-\n\nimposing multiple  sanctions for  a single act  of misconduct\n\nviolated  double   jeopardy.    He  argued   that  the  board\n\ncontravened  \"common  law\"  by  (1) basing  its  findings  on\n\nunsupported written testimony and  (2) failing to explain its\n\ncredibility findings.   And  he contended that  each incident\n\nwas attributable to the negligent supervision of defendants--\n\nconduct which in No. 92-1927, at least, amounted to cruel and\n\nunusual  punishment.  The  district court found  that none of\n\nthese allegations presented a federal claim  cognizable under\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983.  \n\n     Appellate review  of a dismissal under  Rule 12(b)(6) is\n\nplenary.

It is plain that the board's findings\n\nwere supported by \"some evidence in the record\"--the standard\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  evidentiary  sufficiency  mandated  by  the  Due  Process\n\nClause.  Hill,  472 U.S. at 454.   Nor has he  stated a claim\n             \n\nwith respect to (1) the board's consideration of the evidence\n\nor  (2) its description of  the evidence on  which it relied.\n\nThe  Wolff   Court  held   that  \"confrontation  and   cross-\n          \n\nexamination\" are  not \"generally  required\" in  this context.\n\n418 U.S. at 568.   Consequently, the board's reliance  on the\n\nwritten  disciplinary reports was  proper, particularly since\n\neach report  contained an eyewitness account.   In explaining\n\nits  findings,  the board  indicated that  it relied  on \"the\n\neyewitness testimony as recorded  in the officer's report\" in\n\neach  case and, in No.  92-1927, on the  physical evidence as\n\nwell.  Such summary  explanations have been deemed sufficient\n\nin  other cases  (depending on  the facts  presented).

They were\n             \n\nclearly adequate under the  circumstances here.  The evidence\n\nat  the  hearings  was  straightforward.    And  rather  than\n\nattempting  to controvert  the  central  factual  allegations\n\nunderlying the charges, plaintiff sought to defend himself by\n\nciting the collateral issue  of his mental status.4   For the\n\n                    \n\n4.  Plaintiff's  challenge  to  the superintendent's  alleged\nfailure  to  explain  his  reasons for  denying  the  appeals\nsimilarly  falters.   No  such obligation  is imposed  by the\nstate regulations.  See 103 C.M.R.    430.18.  And we find no\n                       \nsuch obligation  as a  constitutional matter, given  that the\nboard adequately explained its findings.\n\n                             -9-\n\nsame  reason,  no issue  of credibility  was presented  as to\n\nwhether plaintiff  actually committed the acts  with which he\n\nwas charged.\n\n     The issue of plaintiff's requests to call Dr. Navaras as\n\na  witness  deserves closer  scrutiny.5    As mentioned,  the\n\nCourt in Wolff held that an inmate \"should be allowed to call\n              \n\nwitnesses ... in  his defense  when permitting him  to do  so\n\nwill  not  be unduly  hazardous  to  institutional safety  or\n\ncorrectional goals.\"  418 U.S.  at 566.  In Ponte, the  Court\n                                                 \n\nclarified that prison officials have the burden of justifying\n\nthe  denial of a witness request by tendering an explanation,\n\neither  during the  administrative hearing  or  in connection\n\nwith  subsequent litigation.    471 U.S.  at 497-99;  accord,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Smith, 936 F.2d at 1399-1400.  This rule is intended to\n           \n\nguard against arbitrary action by  requiring prison officials\n\n\"to explain, in  a limited manner,  the reason why  witnesses\n\nwere  not allowed  to  testify.\"   Ponte,  471 U.S.  at  497.\n                                        \n\nReasonable  explanations include not only interests of prison\n\nsafety  and  discipline, but  also  legitimate administrative\n\nconcerns.

By contrast,  no colorable claim  is presented  regarding\nplaintiff's  alleged  requests to  call  the  authors of  the\ndisciplinary  reports  as  witnesses.    Even  if  we  assume\n(contrary to  the notations in the hearing records) that such\nrequests  were made,  prison officials  are not  required \"to\nprovide reasons in writing to inmates denied the privilege to\n...   confront  witnesses   against   them  in   disciplinary\nproceedings.\"    Baxter  v.

Cf. Powell v.

To  be sure, Dr.  Navaras (apparently plaintiff's\n\ntreating psychiatrist) likely would have been able to provide\n\nbackground  information  as  to  plaintiff's  mental  health,\n\nperhaps   even  as  to   his  susceptibility   to  \"psychotic\n\nepisodes.\"    Yet  under  the  rather  unusual  circumstances\n\npresented (with an inmate  personally proclaiming that he had\n\n                             -11-\n\nbeen \"insane\"  two weeks  earlier), any such  testimony would\n\nhave  been of  marginal relevance,  and would  obviously have\n\nexpanded the scope of the hearing in a manner the board might\n\nreasonably have wished to avoid.  \n\n     In  the  property-destruction  case, the  board  did not\n\npermit  Dr.  Navaras to  testify  because,  according to  the\n\nrecord, plaintiff had failed  to submit the required witness-\n\nrequest  form.   Such  a  rationale  constitutes an  adequate\n\njustification.  See, e.g., Hamilton v. O'Leary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591431\"><a href=\"/opinion/591431/edward-hamilton-v-michael-oleary-michael-p-lane-vern-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                              \n\n346-47 (7th Cir. 1992); Smith, 936 F.2d at 1400 (\"denial of a\n                             \n\nrequest to call  a witness on the ground that  the request is\n\nuntimely   is   well    within   the   disciplinary   board's\n\ndiscretion\").     As   mentioned,  plaintiff   disputes  this\n\nconclusion, alleging that he did submit the form but that Lt.\n\nAyala  tore it up.  The  administrative record indicates that\n\nthe  board, after hearing  these differing  explanations from\n\nplaintiff and Ayala, chose to believe the  latter.  Arguably,\n\nthis   credibility   determination,   although  involving   a\n\ncollateral  issue,  is one  subject  to  scrutiny only  under\n\nHill's  \"some  evidence\"  standard--a test  which  \"does  not\n    \n\nrequire  examination   of  the  entire   record,  independent\n\nassessment of  the credibility  of witnesses, or  weighing of\n\nthe evidence.\"   472 U.S. at  455.  We need  not resolve that\n\nissue, however,  since plaintiff's allegation,  even if true,\n\nwould  involve at most harmless  error.

For the\n                       \n\nreasons  discussed  above,  Dr.  Navaras'  testimony  in  the\n\nproperty-destruction case would again have been of negligible\n\nrelevance.   Indeed,  the  fact that  plaintiff  hid the  two\n\n\"weapons\"  in  the  cell--conduct  quite  at  odds  with  any\n\nsuggestion of \"insanity\"--suggests that psychiatric testimony\n\nwould have been even less relevant here.\n\n     For   these  reasons,   we  conclude   that  plaintiff's\n\ncomplaints were properly dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).6\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n6.
