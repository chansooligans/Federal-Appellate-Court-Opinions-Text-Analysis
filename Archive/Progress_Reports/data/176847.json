Raúl     Figueroa-González\n\n(\"Figueroa\") was charged, in two separate indictments, with four\n\ncounts of carjacking, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1) (2006), and four counts\n\nof use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,\n\nid. § 924(c)(1)(A). The two cases were eventually consolidated for\n\nchange-of-plea and sentencing, and Figueroa then pled guilty to\n\nthree counts of carjacking and one of firearm use.               He now appeals\n\nthe   conviction,    contesting    the     district      court's    finding   of\n\ncompetency.\n\n           The issue of Figueroa's competence arose during plea\n\nbargaining, and the government, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a)-\n\n(b), requested a comprehensive mental evaluation at a federal\n\nmedical facility.      In response, the district court appointed\n\nforensic psychiatrist Cynthia Casanova Pelosi and--on Casanova's\n\nrecommendation--clinical psychologist María Teresa Margarida Juliá;\n\nboth evaluations were conducted at a local detention center, rather\n\nthan a federal facility.\n\n           Margarida's neuropsychological evaluation in March 2006\n\nnoted   Figueroa's   clinical     history    of    mental    retardation      and\n\nincluded   intelligence    test     results       that    indicated     moderate\n\ncognitive impairment and an IQ of 47.          However, she also reported\n\nthat Figueroa showed \"variable effort throughout the test, which\n\nmeans   that   his    performance     is    probably       not     an   accurate\n\nrepresentation of his optimal capacity.\"            Taking that factor into\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\faccount, she still placed him in the \"mild to moderate range of\n\nmental retardation.\"      She concluded:\n\n           [Figueroa's] neuropsychological status reveals\n           a diminished capacity and limitations in his\n           ability to assist in the process of his\n           defense and understand the process of a trial,\n           but does not impair him from being able to\n           understand the nature of the accusations and\n           charges against him.   He can be assisted to\n           compensate for his cognitive limitations by\n           the use of memory aids . . . .\n\n           Casanova's forensic psychiatric report was based on a\n\ntwo-hour interview with Figueroa, interviews with his father and\n\ndefense   counsel   and   her    review    of   documents.         Based   on   the\n\ninformation collected1 and her own evaluation, Casanova concluded\n\nthat Figueroa \"is barely able to understand the charges pending\n\nagainst him and possible consequences but is not able to cooperate\n\nwith counsel in his defense, nor able to follow and participate\n\nduring court procedures in an efficient manner.\"\n\n           The    government     disagreed,      citing      the     \"degree    of\n\nleadership,      participation     and     conduct\"   Figueroa        exhibited:\n\nobtaining and using weapons, leading a violent gang, participating\n\nin home invasions and carjackings, preventing victims from alerting\n\nauthorities, abusing and threatening victims, taking hostages,\n\n\n     1\n      Figueroa's lawyer told Casanova that \"when he tries to\nexplain the charges, possible consequences and alternatives such as\nplea bargains, [Figueroa] remains mute, [claims] not to remember\nthings and occasionally cries.\"      Figueroa denied knowing the\ncircumstances leading to his arrest, the penalties related to the\ncharges, the name of his lawyer, or what a district attorney or\njury would do.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdriving vehicles, demanding ATM withdrawals, and abandoning victims\n\nin    deserted       areas.         The    government         sought    a   comprehensive\n\nevaluation in a federal facility to which the court agreed, but in\n\nthe meantime it proceeded with a scheduled competency hearing.\n\n            At the April 7, 2006, competency hearing, Carlos E.\n\nRoscoe, a member of the FBI carjacking task force, testified.                            He\n\ndescribed    Figueroa         as    striking       a   victim     and   a   reluctant   co-\n\nconspirator,         forcing        victims    to       withdraw    money     from     ATMs,\n\norganizing       a    group        for    robbery,       giving    orders     to     others,\n\ncommunicating        directions          through       hand   signals,      issuing   death\n\nthreats, and being involved in drug sales.\n\n            Margarida was unavailable, so the only other testimony\n\ncame from Casanova.            She stated that Figueroa has tested to have\n\n\"between moderate to mild mental retardation\" and after hearing the\n\nFBI testimony she would lean towards mild retardation rather than\n\nmoderate.        She then testified that, in her opinion, Figueroa\n\nunderstood the charges and possible consequences. He could be \"fit\n\nto proceed\" only if medicated and given careful explanations of the\n\nplea bargaining prior to the hearing, and he was limited in his\n\nability to discuss the situation with his lawyer.\n\n            Figueroa was then evaluated at the Federal Detention\n\nCenter, Miami, Florida, from July 12, 2006, to August 26, 2006.\n\nBased on four hours of psychological testing, a review of records\n\nand   interviews       of     the    attorneys         and    detention     center    staff,\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fforensic psychologist Jorge Luis found Figueroa competent to stand\n\ntrial, concluding that \"there is no evidence that Mr. Figueroa-\n\nGonzalez is currently experiencing the active phase of a mental\n\ndisorder or defect that would render him unable to understand the\n\nnature and consequences of the proceedings against him at this\n\ntime.\"\n\n            Although Figueroa obtained the lowest possible scores for\n\nintellectual    functioning,        Luis    found   that   the    defendant     was\n\nmalingering--deliberately attempting to perform more poorly than\n\nhis actual capacity.2        In addition, Luis believed that the earlier\n\nevaluations were \"probably invalid\" because Margarida's report\n\nsuggested     malingering     and     because   she    did    not      follow   the\n\nstandardized administration of the test.\n\n            On January 25, 2007, the district court attempted to hold\n\na change of plea hearing.           Figueroa complained of his counsel's\n\nperformance    in     relation   to   the    calculation     of   his    sentence,\n\nexhibiting     what    the    district      court   took     to   be    a   cogent\n\nunderstanding of a complex sentencing matter.                The district court\n\nagreed to replace his counsel, and noted that Figueroa was \"a lot\n\n\n     2\n      For example, Luis reported that on one test Figueroa's\nperformance was \"consistently poor on the easiest items and his\nperformance improved as item difficulty increased.\"     On another\ntest, \"his scores were significantly below chance levels of\nresponding and significantly below the results obtained in\ngenuinely impaired individuals. This suggest[s] that the defendant\nattended to the questions, understood the content, scanned for the\ncorrect response, and purposely chose the incorrect responses on a\nconsistent basis.\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\fmore capable than we think\" given his ability to understand the\n\nissue, which had been discussed entirely in English.\n\n          At a new hearing on March 22, 2007, Figueroa stated that\n\nhe was competent, and his counsel stated that he \"had been able to\n\nestablish . . . effective communication with [Figueroa]\" and that\n\nhe had \"no doubts . . . that he understands what he is doing and\n\nthat he is, in fact, competent.\"      Figueroa then pled guilty to\n\nthree counts of carjacking and one of firearm use.          He was\n\nsentenced to concurrent 18-year sentences for the carjacking counts\n\nand a consecutive 7-year sentence for the firearm count.\n\n          The only argument Figueroa raises on appeal is whether\n\nthe district court erred in finding him competent to plead guilty.\n\nThis court raised a second issue sua sponte as to whether the\n\nsentence for the firearm count was properly based on brandishing,\n\nfor which a 7-year sentence is a mandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii), but both parties agree that the facts in the\n\nrecord clearly indicate brandishing so we need say no more about\n\nthat issue.\n\n          Figueroa's appellate brief suggests two legal bases for\n\nhis competency claim:   that Figueroa's alleged actual incompetence\n\nat the time of pleading violated his substantive due process under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment and that the court violated Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 11. But the latter consists solely of the claim\n\nthat Figueroa was not competent to plead or be sentenced, cf.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fUnited States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 43 (1st Cir. 2004), and so is\n\nsubsumed in the former.\n\n            Arguably, Figueroa has forfeited or even waived these\n\nclaims:    his trial counsel raised questions about competency, but\n\nthat counsel, his successor, and Figueroa himself each stated\n\nduring the change-of-plea hearings that Figueroa was competent and\n\nunderstood the charges and the plea.           Whether a waiver would be\n\nvalid if the defendant were incompetent might be debated,3 but\n\nFigueroa's claims would fail even if they had been raised and\n\nmaintained throughout the proceedings below.\n\n            Figueroa argues that the district court misunderstood the\n\nproper legal standard for competency, a claim we review de novo.\n\nUnited    States   v.   Wiggin,   429   F.3d   31,   37   (1st   Cir.   2005).\n\n\"Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the same\n\ncriteria as those governing competence to stand trial: whether the\n\ndefendant is able to understand the proceedings and assist his\n\ncounsel with a reasonable degree of rationality.\" United States v.\n\n\n\n     3\n      See Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 384 (1966) (\"[I]t is\ncontradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet\nknowingly or intelligently 'waive' his right to have the court\ndetermine his capacity to stand trial.\"); United States v. Hurley,\n63 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 1995) (same), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105\n(1996). But cf. United States v. Giron-Reyes, 234 F.3d 78, 80 (1st\nCir. 2000) (reviewing claimed defect in competency proceedings only\nfor plain error); United States v. Muriel-Cruz, 412 F.3d 9, 11 (1st\nCir. 2005) (same).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fMorrisette, 429 F.3d 318, 322 (1st Cir. 2005).                     Figueroa asserts\n\nthat the district court focused only on \"alleged dangerousness\" and\n\nhad decided in advance that Figueroa was both guilty and competent.\n\n              Figueroa points to comments of the judge that suggest\n\nconcern about Figueroa's dangerousness and that state that Figueroa\n\nwill not be \"let . . . loose\" or allowed to \"walk away,\" but these\n\nare   taken    out   of    context.       A     careful   review    of    the   entire\n\ntranscript     shows      that   the    district    judge    did    not   substitute\n\ndangerousness for the correct standard and did not predetermine the\n\nissue.\n\n              Indeed, in its order appointing Casanova, the district\n\ncourt expressly stated the question to be \"whether the defendant\n\nunderstands the charges against him and is able to assist counsel\n\nin the preparation of a defense.\"               Casanova and Luis' reports both\n\ndirectly address these issues.            And at the competency hearing, the\n\ncourt asked Casanova a series of questions regarding Figueroa's\n\nability   to     communicate       with       his   lawyer   and     remember      his\n\nparticipation in the criminal acts.\n\n              Where the correct standard is applied, we \"uphold a\n\ndistrict judge's determination of competency after a hearing unless\n\nclearly erroneous.\"         United States v. Santos, 131 F.3d 16, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (citing United States v. Lebrón, 76 F.3d 29, 32 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1011 (1996)).                  Here, there was no\n\nerror, clear or otherwise.             The district court was presented with\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fconflicting evidence and chose to conclude that the evidence was\n\nstronger in favor of competency.\n\n             It is true that Casanova had initially found Figueroa\n\nunable to assist counsel, and Margarida found him limited in his\n\nability     to   assist   counsel   and   understand   the   trial   process.\n\nHowever, Luis had more extensive observation of Figueroa and found\n\nhim competent (and malingering); Roscoe testified as to his ability\n\nto plan, execute, and lead crimes; Figueroa and his counsels\n\nassured the court that he was competent; and the court itself\n\nobserved that Figueroa was \"a lot more capable than we think.\"\n\nChoosing to credit the second set of factors falls well within the\n\ncourt's domain.       See Pike v. Guarino, 492 F.3d 61, 77 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 552 U.S. 1066 (2007).\n\n             Figueroa's brief may imply that the court should have\n\nheld a second competency hearing sua sponte after receiving Luis'\n\nreport.     However, a court generally need not hold a hearing after\n\na qualified expert has found a defendant competent, United States\n\nv. Bruck, 152 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 1998); here, Figueroa had not\n\npreviously been found incompetent by a court, cf. Giron-Reyes, 234\n\nF.3d   at    81-82,   and   nothing   after   Luis'    report   suggested   a\n\ndeterioration, see Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco, 556 F.3d 53, 83 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 639 (2009).\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

The two cases were eventually consolidated for change-of-plea and sentencing, and Figueroa then pled guilty to three counts of carjacking and one of firearm use. He now appeals the conviction, contesting the district court's finding of competency.</p>\n<p>The issue of Figueroa's competence arose during plea bargaining, and the government, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a)-(b), requested a comprehensive mental evaluation at a federal medical facility. In response, the district court appointed forensic psychiatrist Cynthia Casanova Pelosi andon Casanova's recommendation clinical psychologist Mara Teresa Margarida Juliá both evaluations were conducted at a local detention center, rather than a federal facility.</p>\n<p>Margarida's neuropsychological evaluation in March 2006 noted Figueroa's clinical history of mental retardation and included intelligence test results that indicated moderate cognitive impairment and an IQ of 47. However, she also reported that Figueroa showed \"variable effort throughout the test, which means that his performance is probably not an accurate representation of his optimal capacity.\" Taking that factor into account, she still placed him in the \"mild to moderate range of mental retardation.\" She concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>[Figueroa's] neuropsychological status reveals a diminished capacity and limitations in his ability to assist in the process of his defense and understand the process of a trial, but does not impair him from being able to understand the nature of the accusations and charges against him. He can be assisted to compensate for his cognitive limitations by the use of memory aids....</blockquote>\n<p>Casanova's forensic psychiatric report was based on a two-hour interview with Figueroa, interviews with his father and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> defense counsel and her review of documents. Based on the information collected<sup>[1]</sup> and her own evaluation, Casanova concluded that Figueroa \"is barely able to understand the charges pending against him and possible consequences but is not able to cooperate with counsel in his defense, nor able to follow and participate during court procedures in an efficient manner.\"</p>\n<p>The government disagreed, citing the \"degree of leadership, participation and conduct\" Figueroa exhibited: obtaining and using weapons, leading a violent gang, participating in home invasions and carjackings, preventing victims from alerting authorities, abusing and threatening victims, taking hostages, driving vehicles, demanding ATM withdrawals, and abandoning victims in deserted areas. The government sought a comprehensive evaluation in a federal facility to which the court agreed, but in the meantime it proceeded with a scheduled competency hearing.</p>\n<p>At the April 7, 2006, competency hearing, Carlos E. Roscoe, a member of the FBI carjacking task force, testified. He described Figueroa as striking a victim and a reluctant co-conspirator, forcing victims to withdraw money from ATMs, organizing a group for robbery, giving orders to others, communicating directions through hand signals, issuing death threats, and being involved in drug sales.</p>\n<p>Margarida was unavailable, so the only other testimony came from Casanova. She stated that Figueroa has tested to have \"between moderate to mild mental retardation\" and after hearing the FBI testimony she would lean towards mild retardation rather than moderate. She then testified that, in her opinion, Figueroa understood the charges and possible consequences. He could be \"fit to proceed\" only if medicated and given careful explanations of the plea bargaining <i>prior</i> to the hearing, and he was limited in his ability to discuss the situation with his lawyer.</p>\n<p>Figueroa was then evaluated at the Federal Detention Center, Miami, Florida, from July 12, 2006, to August 26, 2006. Based on four hours of psychological testing, a review of records and interviews of the attorneys and detention center staff, forensic psychologist Jorge Luis found Figueroa competent to stand trial, concluding that \"there is no evidence that Mr. Figueroa-Gonzalez is currently experiencing the active phase of a mental disorder or defect that would render him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him at this time.\"</p>\n<p>Although Figueroa obtained the lowest possible scores for intellectual functioning, Luis found that the defendant was malingeringdeliberately attempting to perform more poorly than his actual capacity.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, Luis believed that the earlier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> evaluations were \"probably invalid\" because Margarida's report suggested malingering and because she did not follow the standardized administration of the test.</p>\n<p>On January 25, 2007, the district court attempted to hold a change of plea hearing. Figueroa complained of his counsel's performance in relation to the calculation of his sentence, exhibiting what the district court took to be a cogent understanding of a complex sentencing matter.

Matos de Juan, by appointment of the court, on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, on consolidated brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, DYK<sup>[*]</sup> and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Raúl Figueroa-González (\"Figueroa\") was charged, in two separate indictments, with four counts of carjacking, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1) (2006), and four counts of use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, <i>id.</i> § 924(c)(1)(A). The two cases were eventually consolidated for change-of-plea and sentencing, and Figueroa then pled guilty to three counts of carjacking and one of firearm use. He now appeals the conviction, contesting the district court's finding of competency.</p>\n<p>The issue of Figueroa's competence arose during plea bargaining, and the government, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a)-(b), requested a comprehensive mental evaluation at a federal medical facility. In response, the district court appointed forensic psychiatrist Cynthia Casanova Pelosi andon Casanova's recommendation clinical psychologist Mara Teresa Margarida Juliá both evaluations were conducted at a local detention center, rather than a federal facility.</p>\n<p>Margarida's neuropsychological evaluation in March 2006 noted Figueroa's clinical history of mental retardation and included intelligence test results that indicated moderate cognitive impairment and an IQ of 47. However, she also reported that Figueroa showed \"variable effort throughout the test, which means that his performance is probably not an accurate representation of his optimal capacity.\" Taking that factor into account, she still placed him in the \"mild to moderate range of mental retardation.\" She concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>[Figueroa's] neuropsychological status reveals a diminished capacity and limitations in his ability to assist in the process of his defense and understand the process of a trial, but does not impair him from being able to understand the nature of the accusations and charges against him. He can be assisted to compensate for his cognitive limitations by the use of memory aids....</blockquote>\n<p>Casanova's forensic psychiatric report was based on a two-hour interview with Figueroa, interviews with his father and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> defense counsel and her review of documents. Based on the information collected<sup>[1]</sup> and her own evaluation, Casanova concluded that Figueroa \"is barely able to understand the charges pending against him and possible consequences but is not able to cooperate with counsel in his defense, nor able to follow and participate during court procedures in an efficient manner.\"</p>\n<p>The government disagreed, citing the \"degree of leadership, participation and conduct\" Figueroa exhibited: obtaining and using weapons, leading a violent gang, participating in home invasions and carjackings, preventing victims from alerting authorities, abusing and threatening victims, taking hostages, driving vehicles, demanding ATM withdrawals, and abandoning victims in deserted areas. The government sought a comprehensive evaluation in a federal facility to which the court agreed, but in the meantime it proceeded with a scheduled competency hearing.</p>\n<p>At the April 7, 2006, competency hearing, Carlos E. Roscoe, a member of the FBI carjacking task force, testified. He described Figueroa as striking a victim and a reluctant co-conspirator, forcing victims to withdraw money from ATMs, organizing a group for robbery, giving orders to others, communicating directions through hand signals, issuing death threats, and being involved in drug sales.</p>\n<p>Margarida was unavailable, so the only other testimony came from Casanova. She stated that Figueroa has tested to have \"between moderate to mild mental retardation\" and after hearing the FBI testimony she would lean towards mild retardation rather than moderate. She then testified that, in her opinion, Figueroa understood the charges and possible consequences. He could be \"fit to proceed\" only if medicated and given careful explanations of the plea bargaining <i>prior</i> to the hearing, and he was limited in his ability to discuss the situation with his lawyer.</p>\n<p>Figueroa was then evaluated at the Federal Detention Center, Miami, Florida, from July 12, 2006, to August 26, 2006. Based on four hours of psychological testing, a review of records and interviews of the attorneys and detention center staff, forensic psychologist Jorge Luis found Figueroa competent to stand trial, concluding that \"there is no evidence that Mr. Figueroa-Gonzalez is currently experiencing the active phase of a mental disorder or defect that would render him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him at this time.\"</p>\n<p>Although Figueroa obtained the lowest possible scores for intellectual functioning, Luis found that the defendant was malingeringdeliberately attempting to perform more poorly than his actual capacity.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, Luis believed that the earlier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> evaluations were \"probably invalid\" because Margarida's report suggested malingering and because she did not follow the standardized administration of the test.</p>\n<p>On January 25, 2007, the district court attempted to hold a change of plea hearing. Figueroa complained of his counsel's performance in relation to the calculation of his sentence, exhibiting what the district court took to be a cogent understanding of a complex sentencing matter. The district court agreed to replace his counsel, and noted that Figueroa was \"a lot more capable than we think\" given his ability to understand the issue, which had been discussed entirely in English.</p>\n<p>At a new hearing on March 22, 2007, Figueroa stated that he was competent, and his counsel stated that he \"had been able to establish ... effective communication with [Figueroa]\" and that he had \"no doubts ... that he understands what he is doing and that he is, in fact, competent.\" Figueroa then pled guilty to three counts of carjacking and one of firearm use. He was sentenced to concurrent 18-year sentences for the carjacking counts and a consecutive 7-year sentence for the firearm count.</p>\n<p>The only argument Figueroa raises on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding him competent to plead guilty. This court raised a second issue <i>sua sponte</i> as to whether the sentence for the firearm count was properly based on brandishing, for which a 7-year sentence is a mandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), but both parties agree that the facts in the record clearly indicate brandishing so we need say no more about that issue.</p>\n<p>Figueroa's appellate brief suggests two legal bases for his competency claim: that Figueroa's alleged actual incompetence at the time of pleading violated his substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment and that the court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. But the latter consists solely of the claim that Figueroa was not competent to plead or be sentenced, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Cheal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201336\"><a href=\"/opinion/201336/united-states-v-cheal/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2004), and so is subsumed in the former.</p>\n<p>Arguably, Figueroa has forfeited or even waived these claims: his trial counsel raised questions about competency, but that counsel, his successor, and Figueroa himself each stated during the change-of-plea hearings that Figueroa was competent and understood the charges and the plea. Whether a waiver would be valid if the defendant were incompetent might be debated,<sup>[3]</sup> but Figueroa's claims would fail even if they had been raised and maintained throughout the proceedings below.</p>\n<p>Figueroa argues that the district court misunderstood the proper legal standard for competency, a claim we review <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Wiggin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201923\"><a href=\"/opinion/201923/united-states-v-wiggin/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005). \"Competence to enter a guilty plea is determined by the same criteria as those governing competence to stand trial: whether the defendant is able to understand the proceedings and assist his counsel with a reasonable degree of rationality.\" <i>United States v.
