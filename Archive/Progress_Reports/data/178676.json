Defendant-appellant Amit Mathur\n\nwants    a    new   trial     or,   at    least,   resentencing   based     on    the\n\ngovernment's tardy disclosure of Brady material.                      See Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).              Concluding, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict      court   acted    appropriately       in   addressing    the   delayed\n\ndisclosure, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               We bifurcate our discussion of the background events,\n\nfirst rehearsing the underlying facts and then charting the course\n\nof the proceedings below.\n\n                                    A.   The Scheme.\n\n               Refined   to     its      essentials,    this   case    involves     a\n\nkaleidoscopic stream of misrepresentations and the misappropriation\n\nof millions of dollars in client funds.                 The best way to capture\n\nthe essence of what transpired is to follow the trail blazed by the\n\nindictment, returned on September 28, 2006, which charged the\n\ndefendant with eighteen counts of mail fraud and two counts of wire\n\nfraud.       See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343.\n\n               From 1997 until 2005, the defendant ran Entrust Capital\n\nManagement (Entrust), which he held out as the manager of a hedge\n\nfund.    Entrust and the defendant maintained offices in Worcester,\n\nMassachusetts, but the defendant's business partner, Rajeev Johar,\n\nworked out of a satellite office in Louisiana.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 2 -\n\f              The indictment identified fifteen defrauded clients, five\n\nof    whom   testified     at     trial.      Their       testimony      confirmed        the\n\ndefendant's successful efforts to inveigle them into investing in\n\nthe hedge fund.           These efforts involved the dissemination of\n\nhyperbolic      marketing       literature,       daily    e-mails,      and     in-person\n\npresentations,      all    of     which    were    designed       to    create    a     false\n\nimpression      that    Entrust     managed    approximately           $105,000,000       in\n\nassets for more than 300 investors.                   These claims were wildly\n\nexaggerated, and the defendant's persistent boast that Entrust's\n\nhedge fund offered high rewards at low risk was unfounded.\n\n              Many potential investors took the bait.                    To illustrate:\n\nThe five testifying investors, in the aggregate, entrusted the\n\ndefendant with roughly $13,500,000 to be invested and managed as\n\npart of the hedge fund.           One of the five, David Massad, earmarked\n\nsome additional money — nearly $9,000,000 — for specified stock\n\npurchases.      The defendant's use of these funds failed to comport\n\neither       with   his     own     representations          or        with     investors'\n\ninstructions.\n\n              This is how the scheme played out.                  When the defendant\n\nreceived money earmarked for the hedge fund, he would deposit it\n\ninto an Entrust account at Commerce Bank — an account over which he\n\nhad    exclusive       control.      Some     money       from    that        account    was\n\ntransferred to a brokerage account at Kimball & Cross Investment\n\nManagement Corp. (K&C).           The defendant retained sole transactional\n\n\n                                          - 3 -\n\fauthority over this account and funneled money from it into the\n\nhedge fund.       The money left in the Commerce Bank account remained\n\nat the defendant's disposal, and he used much of it for personal\n\npurposes.\n\n              Entrust    investors     were       hoodwinked.        They   received\n\nperiodic      statements    (sometimes       monthly,       sometimes     quarterly)\n\npurporting to describe the status of their investments and the\n\nhedge    fund's    performance.        The     statements       reported,    without\n\nexception, that the clients' money had been invested in the hedge\n\nfund and that the investments had appreciated.\n\n              The statements, taken in the ensemble, show the magnitude\n\nof    the    fraud.      Viewed     collectively,       they      represented    that\n\n$13,500,000 had been invested in the hedge fund and that the value\n\nof the investment had grown to approximately $18,200,000 by the end\n\nof 2004. This figure overstated the actual value of the investment\n\nby more than $17,000,000; that is, the investment had depreciated\n\nby    over   ninety     percent.      The     discrepancy       between     Entrust's\n\napocryphal and authentic balance sheets was accounted for by an\n\narray of factors: the hedge fund had incurred (and the defendant\n\nhad    hidden)    investment       losses    in    excess    of    $6,000,000;    the\n\ndefendant had invented $4,700,000 in nonexistent appreciation; and\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 4 -\n\fhe had diverted more than $5,000,000 in client funds for his own\n\npursuits.1\n\n             The defendant's dealings with David Massad were more\n\ncomplicated.     Beginning in 2000, Massad (the principal owner of\n\nCommerce     Bank)   gave   the   defendant     checks   totaling   more   than\n\n$5,000,000 for investment in the hedge fund.               In the summer of\n\n2003, he gave the defendant the further sum of $8,787,000 with\n\ninstructions to purchase 200,000 shares of GMAC preferred stock and\n\n150,000 shares of Ford Motor Credit preferred stock.\n\n             The monies that Massad committed to the hedge fund\n\nsuffered much the same fate as the monies committed by other\n\ninvestors. As to the stock purchases, the defendant assured Massad\n\nthat he had followed his (Massad's) instructions.               In fact, he\n\npurchased fewer than half of the specified number of shares and\n\npocketed the difference. For well over a year, he nonetheless sent\n\nMassad's     accountant     regular    checks    purporting    to   represent\n\nquarterly dividends on the shares that Massad thought he had\n\nacquired.2     Those checks were meant to disguise the defendant's\n\n\n     1\n       The defendant's handling of the funds of Alok Mathur (his\nblood relative) furnishes a particularly egregious example of his\nmendacity. Alok Mathur gave the defendant, for investment, the sum\nof $530,000.    None of this money was ever actually invested.\nInstead, the defendant spent it on jewelry, automobiles, and\nrecreational gambling.\n     2\n       The defendant makes much of Massad's use of David Mandara,\nwho was his son-in-law as well as his accountant, as an\ninternuncio. He does not indicate what, if anything, was wrong\nwith this arrangement.\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\ffailure to purchase the specified number of shares for Massad's\n\naccount.\n\n             From time to time, Massad sought to withdraw sums from\n\nhis Entrust account.      The defendant obliged.         But in early 2005,\n\nMassad asked to withdraw $7,000,000.          The defendant never honored\n\nthis request.\n\n             At about that time, the defendant learned that the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating him. In\n\nresponse, he contacted his investors and set up a meeting with\n\nthem.   At this meeting, which was held in April of 2005, the\n\ndefendant urged the investors to destroy the false statements\n\nshowing gains in their hedge fund accounts and replace them with\n\nstatements    showing   losses.      He    explained,    falsely,    that   the\n\nproposal was designed to help them avoid tax liability on their\n\ngains, which he disingenuously maintained were still increasing.\n\nThis artifice drew no takers and, therefore, no investors destroyed\n\ntheir original statements in response to it.\n\n             In the end, Massad and the other investors sustained\n\nsubstantial losses as a result of the defendant's chicanery.                The\n\nSEC's investigation continued, leading to both criminal and civil\n\nproceedings against the defendant.\n\n                           B.     The Aftermath.\n\n             This brings us to the defendant's criminal trial, which\n\nbegan   on   May   5,   2008.     The     government    introduced   evidence\n\n\n                                    - 6 -\n\festablishing the facts recounted above.                In the course of its case\n\nin   chief,     it     produced    copious       evidence      corroborating        the\n\ndefendant's role in the fraudulent scheme (including his use of the\n\nmails and wire transmissions).\n\n           The       defendant    premised      his    defense   on   two    lack-of-\n\nknowledge theories.         First, he argued that he himself was an\n\ninnocent dupe whose business partner, Johar, had supplied him with\n\nmisinformation.        Second, he argued that he was somehow a pawn in a\n\nbroad but ill-defined scheme orchestrated by Massad.                  The evidence\n\nat trial belied both theories.            It showed, for example, that the\n\ndefendant received monthly statements from K&C enumerating the\n\nfunds actually contained in Entrust's brokerage account. Moreover,\n\nthe defendant had, on occasion, personally directed the avails of\n\nspecific   (profitable)      trades      both     in    the   hedge   fund    and   in\n\nEntrust's account to his personal accounts. There was no probative\n\nevidence of any overarching plot masterminded by Massad.\n\n           We come now to the denouement.                 On the seventh day of\n\ntrial (May 13, 2008), the government rested.                  Immediately prior to\n\nresting,   it    handed    over     a   previously       undisclosed    memorandum\n\nemanating from the SEC investigation (the SEC Memorandum); this\n\ndocument had not come to the prosecutor's attention until that day.\n\nThe document contained conclusions drawn from interviews with\n\nseveral of the testifying investors.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\f             With regard to Massad, the SEC Memorandum limned three\n\npieces   of    information      that    the    defendant       characterizes     as\n\nsignificant. First, Massad had retained counsel in connection with\n\nhis financial affairs.           Second, Massad had made inconsistent\n\nstatements concerning the amount of money in his Entrust account.\n\nThird, John Sten, an attorney in the law firm of Greenberg Traurig,\n\nhad represented both Massad and the defendant for some period of\n\ntime and, during this period, had delivered bogus bank statements\n\nto the SEC, ostensibly via a Commerce Bank facsimile machine.\n\n             At the end of that day, the defendant moved to dismiss\n\nthe indictment, arguing that the failure to disclose the SEC\n\nMemorandum earlier in the proceedings denied him a fair trial. The\n\ngovernment objected and, in an effort to show that the information\n\ncontained in the SEC Memorandum had previously been turned over,\n\nsubmitted copies of various documents, including SEC interviews of\n\nMassad and other investors, that had been given to the defendant's\n\ncounsel in 2005.\n\n             On May 14, the district court offered to halt the trial\n\nand   give    the   defendant   time     to    \"sort   .   .   .   out\"   the   new\n\ninformation, assuring him that he would not be required to proceed\n\nuntil that feat was accomplished.               The defendant declined the\n\ncourt's invitation.\n\n             On May 15, the court postponed the trial for another day.\n\nIt renewed its invitation for a continuance and again offered to\n\n\n                                       - 8 -\n\fallow the defendant to recall any of the government's witnesses for\n\nfurther cross-examination.       The defendant refused the offers, and\n\nthe court then heard arguments on the motion to dismiss.\n\n           On the next day the court, ruling ore tenus, denied the\n\nmotion.   It emphasized the defendant's decision neither to recall\n\nany witnesses nor to avail himself of a continuance in order to\n\nanalyze and follow up on the belatedly disclosed information.           It\n\nobserved that the defendant had pointed to nothing in the new\n\nmaterial that would have enabled him to impeach any witness, nor\n\nhad he identified any other aspect of the material that would have\n\nbeen helpful to his case in any meaningful sense.          Following the\n\nlawyers' summations and the court's charge, the jury found the\n\ndefendant guilty on all counts.\n\n           We fast-forward to April 1, 2009.         On that date, the\n\ndefendant moved for a new trial.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.   As part\n\nof its opposition, the government disclosed additional materials\n\n(the Greenberg Traurig Documents) elaborating upon the information\n\ncontained in the SEC Memorandum.      The prosecution represented that\n\nit had obtained the Greenberg Traurig Documents from Attorney John\n\nSten after the defendant claimed to have been ignorant of Sten's\n\ndual representation of both Massad and himself.            The Greenberg\n\nTraurig   Documents   included    end-of-year   account   statements,   on\n\nEntrust letterheads and bearing Entrust's Louisiana address, which\n\npurported to show losses in Massad's investment account for 2002,\n\n\n                                   - 9 -\n\f2003, and 2004.       They also included a facsimile cover sheet\n\npurportedly indicating that the documents had been transmitted from\n\na number at Commerce Bank, as well as a transmittal letter from\n\nSten to the SEC.\n\n           Four    days   later,   the    district   court   held   a   non-\n\nevidentiary hearing.      It denied the defendant's new trial motion,\n\nconcluding that much of the information contained in the SEC\n\nMemorandum, as explicated by the Greenberg Traurig Documents, was\n\neither irrelevant or immaterial.         Although a small fraction of the\n\ninformation might have been used for impeachment purposes, it was\n\nof questionable value and incapable of affecting the outcome of the\n\ntrial.\n\n           The court then turned to sentencing.        The defendant did\n\nnot object to proceeding on that day, nor did he request a\n\ncontinuance.      After further arguments and allocution, the court\n\nimposed a 120-month incarcerative term on each count of conviction,\n\nto run concurrently.      This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The defendant contends that the district court erred both\n\nin denying his motion for a new trial and in sentencing him too\n\nhastily.     These plaints rest on the notion that the government\n\nfailed to satisfy its Brady obligations and thereby prejudiced the\n\ndefendant.    Given the related nature of these plaints, we address\n\nthem together.\n\n\n                                   - 10 -\n\f           To gain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence,\n\na defendant normally must pass a four-part test: he must show that\n\n(i) the evidence in question was unknown or unavailable to him at\n\nthe time of trial; (ii) his failure to learn of it did not result\n\nfrom a lack of due diligence on his part; (iii) the evidence is\n\nmaterial; and (iv) the evidence, if available upon retrial, would\n\nlikely bring about an acquittal.     United States v. Huddleston, 194\n\nF.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d\n\n1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980).    When, however, a criminal defendant's\n\nnew trial motion is premised on the belated disclosure of evidence\n\nthat should have been made available to him in accordance with the\n\nimperatives of Brady, a somewhat less formidable standard applies.\n\n           To obtain the benefit of this more defendant-friendly\n\nparadigm, a defendant must make three showings.       \"The evidence at\n\nissue (whether exculpatory or impeaching) must be favorable to the\n\naccused;   that   evidence   must   have   been   either   willfully   or\n\ninadvertently suppressed by the government; and prejudice must have\n\nensued.\"   United States v. Connolly, 504 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (citing Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999)).\n\nThe first two showings are comparable to the first two requirements\n\nof the Wright test.\n\n           The difference between the two standards lies in the\n\nreplacement of the last two requirements of the Wright test \"with\n\nthe unitary requirement that the defendant establish 'a reasonable\n\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.'\"               Id. at\n\n213 (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)).\n\nIn   this    context,   the   Supreme    Court   has   equated     \"reasonable\n\nprobability\" with something sufficient to \"undermine[] confidence\n\nin the outcome of the trial.\"      Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434\n\n(1995) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n             We have noted two other refinements that distinguish the\n\nBrady new trial standard from the ordinary Wright standard.                   See\n\nConnolly, 504 F.3d at 213. First, the probability that a defendant\n\nmust show does not have to be an \"actual probability that the\n\nresult would have differed\"; it may be \"a merely theoretical (but\n\nstill    reasonable)    probability.\"     Id.    (emphasis    in    original).\n\nSecond,     \"undisclosed   impeachment    evidence,    if    it    suffices    to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the trial, may carry the\n\nday.\"    Id. (citing Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682).\n\n             We do not apply these standards directly.            In the first\n\ninstance, that is the responsibility of the trial court. The trial\n\njudge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, has a\n\nspecial sense \"of the ebb and flow of the recently concluded\n\ntrial.\"     United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).    Thus, his views about the likely impact of newly disclosed\n\nevidence deserve considerable deference.            Connolly, 504 F.3d at\n\n211; United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 489 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                  - 12 -\n\f2007). For those reasons, we review the challenged rulings in this\n\ncase for abuse of discretion.3             See, e.g., Connolly, 504 F.3d at\n\n211; United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nIt is within the confines of this template that we consider whether\n\nthe late disclosure of either the SEC Memorandum or the Greenberg\n\nTraurig Documents warrants relief.\n\n              We    start   with    the    arguendo    assumption   that   these\n\nmaterials, which comprised part of the parallel SEC investigation,\n\nwere       constructively    in    the     prosecution's     possession.      See\n\nStrickler, 527 U.S. at 280-81 (extending the disclosure obligation\n\nto materials in the possession of government agents).                    We also\n\nassume, again for argument's sake, that the substance of the\n\nmaterials was not made available to the defendant before trial.\n\nThese assumptions permit us to narrow the lens of our inquiry to\n\nfocus on whether the evidence was favorable to the defendant and,\n\nif so, whether its dilatory disclosure prejudiced him.\n\n              The   defendant      asserts   that     the   belatedly   disclosed\n\nmaterials would have supported his theory that Massad was not a\n\nvictim but, rather, was engaged in \"funny business of his own.\"               In\n\nhis view, the SEC Memorandum shows that Massad retained control of\n\nhis own finances and told inconsistent stories about his dealings\n\n\n       3\n       The government argues that the defendant failed to preserve\nhis claim of error with respect to the Greenberg Traurig Documents\nand that, therefore, we should review the rejection of that claim\nonly for plain error. This argument is of dubious force and, in\nany event, it is unnecessary for us to consider it.\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\fwith Entrust.       Moreover, the Greenberg Traurig Documents can be\n\nread to indicate that Massad forwarded bogus statements to the SEC\n\n(through      Sten).      The     defendant      protests         that     the   timely\n\navailability of these materials would have enabled him to impeach\n\nMassad.      He further insists that the materials have a potentially\n\nexculpatory value because they suggest that (i) Massad was using\n\nSten as part of a plot to manipulate the defendant and to obscure\n\nhis    own   malefactions   and     (ii)    Massad          and   others    should    be\n\ninvestigated further for potential fraudulent activity.\n\n             The    defendant's    claim    that       he    could   have    used    the\n\nbelatedly disclosed materials for impeachment purposes is wishful\n\nthinking.     The impact of withholding evidence is more severe when\n\nit    is   highly   impeaching     or    when    the    impeached        testimony    is\n\nessential to the defendant's conviction.                United States v. Avilés-\n\nColón, 536 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2008).                       Here, however, these\n\nconditions do not obtain.          The defendant's attempt to shift the\n\nblame to Massad verges on the chimerical. The impeachment value of\n\nthe evidence is marginal (necessarily so, given the vagueness of\n\nthe defendant's allegations), and that value could effectively have\n\nbeen realized by recalling Massad for further cross-examination.\n\n             What is more, the modest impeachment potential of this\n\nevidence is diminished by the extensive corroboration of Massad's\n\ndirect testimony. Like other testifying investors, Massad was able\n\nto describe in exquisite detail the losses that he incurred as a\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fresult of the defendant's misrepresentations and misappropriations.\n\nTo buttress this testimony, the government introduced abundant\n\ndocumentary evidence supporting a conclusion that Massad had been\n\nvictimized.        This evidence included phony statements sent by the\n\ndefendant purporting to show that Massad's instructions had been\n\nfollowed and that Massad's investments had prospered under the\n\ndefendant's stewardship.             Similarly, the government adduced both\n\ndocumentary        and    testimonial    evidence    demonstrating    that   the\n\ndefendant had sent Massad ersatz dividends on stock that had never\n\nbeen acquired.         The amount of money that Massad ultimately lost in\n\nhis dealings with the defendant bore grim witness to the veracity\n\nof   Massad's      account.      And    finally,    plenitudinous    documentary\n\nevidence spoke to the defendant's esurient use of client money for\n\npersonal expenses and his efforts to hide the truth from his\n\nclients.4        There was a mountain of incriminating evidence against\n\nthe defendant.           Against this backdrop, the marginal impeachment\n\nvalue       of   the     belatedly    disclosed    materials   was    manifestly\n\ninsufficient to place the trial record in \"such a different light\n\nas to undermine confidence in the verdict.\"                Kyles, 514 U.S. at\n\n\n\n        4\n       We note in passing that Massad's testimony was not essential\nto the government's case. The government proved that several other\ninvestors were bilked by the defendant in much the same way. This\nis important because a reviewing court should \"evaluate the\nstrength of . . . impeachment evidence and the effect of its\nsuppression in the context of the entire record to determine its\nmateriality.\" Conley v. United States, 415 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\f435.       Even if Massad was engaged in \"funny business of his own\" —\n\na dubious premise on this record — that fact would not weaken the\n\nrobust nature of the government's case against the defendant.\n\n               The defendant's separate contention that the belatedly\n\ndisclosed documents contain exculpatory information is no more\n\npersuasive.         He claims the materials suggest that Massad employed\n\nSten in furtherance of a contrivance either to manipulate the\n\ndefendant or to set him up as a scapegoat.                     This claim lacks any\n\nfooting in the record.             Furthermore, it is sharply undercut by\n\nSten's uncontradicted statement to the government that he spoke to\n\nMassad only once — during a three-way telephone conversation in\n\nwhich       the    defendant    also      participated.5         Contrary     to    the\n\ndefendant's         importunings,    neither       the   SEC   Memorandum     nor   the\n\nGreenberg         Traurig   Documents,     fairly    read,     support    a   lack-of-\n\nknowledge defense.          These materials simply do not speak, directly\n\nor indirectly, to the defendant's claim of innocence — and saying\n\nthat they do does not make it so.\n\n               We need not probe these points more deeply because, in\n\nall events, the defendant has not shown any cognizable prejudice\n\nattributable to the late disclosure.                We explain briefly.\n\n               To begin, the defendant has not identified any plausible\n\nstrategic         option    that    the    delayed       disclosure      hampered    or\n\n\n       5\n       The defendant could, of course, have recalled Massad to\ninquire into this point, or could have called Sten in his own case.\nHe took no such action.\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\fforeclosed.   See United States v. Misla-Aldarondo, 478 F.3d 52, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).   He was not prevented from advancing his dual lack-of-\n\nknowledge theories at trial, and his counsel argued those theories\n\nvigorously.\n\n          To cinch matters, the able district court, concerned\n\nabout whether the late disclosure might inhibit that effort, went\n\nto great lengths to ensure that the defendant had a full and fair\n\nopportunity to use the new material.       The customary remedy for a\n\nBrady violation that surfaces mid-trial is a continuance and a\n\nconcomitant opportunity to analyze the new information and, if\n\nnecessary,    recall   witnesses.   See,    e.g.,   United   States   v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v.\n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989). The court offered\n\nprecisely this remediation when the SEC Memorandum came to light,\n\nbut the defendant repeatedly rejected the proffered anodynes.\n\n\"Generally, we have viewed the failure to ask for a continuance as\n\nan indication that defense counsel was himself satisfied he had\n\nsufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\" United\n\nStates v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing United\n\nStates v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 413 (1st Cir. 1986)).                A\n\nfortiori, we can draw a comparable inference from a defendant's\n\noutright rejection of a proffered continuance.        Such a decision\n\noften will reveal, with conspicuous clarity, defense counsel's\n\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fperception     that   the   belatedly     disclosed       information       was    not\n\ncritical to his client's defense.          So it is here.\n\n             In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\ndefendant asseverates that the customary remedy was insufficient in\n\nthe   case   at   hand   because    the   jury    already      had    formed   first\n\nimpressions. Other courts have rejected conclusory arguments along\n\nthese same lines.         See, e.g., United States v. Burke, 571 F.3d\n\n1048, 1055-56 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 565 (2009);\n\nUnited States v. Davis, 306 F.3d 398, 420-21 (6th Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Aichele, 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir. 1991).                      So do\n\nwe:   the    defendant    never    explains      why,    in    this   case,    first\n\nimpressions should be regarded as decisive.                   Thus, accepting his\n\nargument would create an exception that would swallow in a single\n\ngulp the general rule requiring parties to ask for continuances.\n\n             In a variation on this theme, the defendant suggests that\n\nthe   late   disclosure     was    prejudicial     because,      if    he   had    the\n\ninformation before trial, he might have negotiated a favorable plea\n\ndeal.   Because he lacked the wherewithal to cast Massad as the\n\nvillain of the piece, his thesis runs, the government was more\n\nsanguine about both the odds of a conviction and the length of the\n\nlikely sentence.         Consequently, it was less amenable to a plea\n\nbargain.\n\n             This argument has no traction.             The animating principle\n\nof Brady is the \"avoidance of an unfair trial.\"                Brady, 373 U.S. at\n\n\n                                     - 18 -\n\f87.   It is, therefore, universally acknowledged that the right\n\nmemorialized in Brady is a trial right.     See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Moussaoui, 591 F.3d 263, 285 (4th Cir. 2010).        Consequently,\n\ncourts enforce Brady in order \"to minimize the chance that an\n\ninnocent person [will] be found guilty.\"   Id.   The core question is\n\nwhether, despite the suppressed evidence, the accused \"received a\n\nfair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of\n\nconfidence.\"   Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434.\n\n          In urging us to extend Brady's prejudice component to\n\npretrial plea negotiations, the defendant exhorts us to break new\n\nground.   He does not cite a single case standing for this novel\n\napproach but, rather, relies on authority extolling the importance\n\nof plea negotiations.   See, e.g., Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 U.S.\n\n212, 222 n.12 (1978). Although we recognize that plea negotiations\n\nare important, that fact provides no support for an unprecedented\n\nexpansion of Brady.   See United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 632\n\n(2002) (warning that the benefits of plea bargaining would be\n\nundermined by an extension of Brady into the pretrial realm).\n\n          The Ruiz Court evinced a reluctance to extend a Brady-\n\nlike right to the realm of pretrial plea negotiations, holding\n\nflatly that \"the Constitution does not require the Government to\n\ndisclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea\n\nagreement with a criminal defendant.\"    Id. at 633.   While the Court\n\nacknowledged that \"the more information the defendant has, the more\n\n\n                              - 19 -\n\faware he is of the likely consequences of a plea,\" it nonetheless\n\nconcluded that a prosecutor has no obligation \"to share all useful\n\ninformation with the defendant\" during pretrial plea negotiations.\n\nId. at 629.\n\n             Ruiz teaches that Brady does not protect against the\n\npossible prejudice that may ensue from the loss of an opportunity\n\nto plea-bargain with complete knowledge of all relevant facts.\n\nThis makes good sense: when a defendant chooses to admit his guilt,\n\nBrady concerns subside.          Moussaoui, 591 F.3d at 285; see also\n\nMatthew v. Johnson, 201 F.3d 353, 361 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"The Brady\n\nrule's focus on protecting the integrity of trials suggests that\n\nwhere   no   trial   is   to   occur,   there   may   be   no   constitutional\n\nviolation.\").     Here, moreover, nothing in the belatedly disclosed\n\ndocuments suggests that they would have significantly strengthened\n\nthe defendant's hand in plea negotiations even if they had been\n\navailable to him from the start.             Accordingly, we reject this\n\niteration of the defendant's prejudice argument.\n\n             The defendant has one more shot in his sling.           He posits\n\nthat the disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents a few days\n\nprior to sentencing adversely impacted the length of his sentence\n\nand the amount of restitution.          He says that, given more time, he\n\ncould have used the belatedly disclosed material to discount\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 20 -\n\fMassad's losses and, thus, lower both his guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR) and the amount of restitution assessed.6\n\n              There are several flaws in the fabric of this argument.\n\nFirst, it is underdeveloped; beyond some conclusory rhetoric, the\n\ndefendant does not explain how the Greenberg Traurig Documents,\n\nwhich contained only information tangentially related to Massad's\n\nfinancial transactions and no information at all related to the\n\namount of Massad's actual losses as an Entrust client, would have\n\nhelped      him   to    overcome   the   extensive   evidence   in   the   record\n\nestablishing Massad's losses and the defendant's responsibility for\n\nthem.       It is not our job to put flesh on the bare bones of an\n\nunderdeveloped argument, United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990), and the defendant's plaint could be rejected for\n\nthat reason alone.\n\n              What is more, the claim of sentencing prejudice is\n\nundermined by the earlier production of the SEC Memorandum.                 That\n\nreport foreshadowed the information contained in the Greenberg\n\nTraurig Documents, and the defendant had it in his possession for\n\nmany months prior to sentencing.            He chose neither to follow up on\n\nit nor to use it as a means of attacking the loss and restitution\n\ncalculations.          That history impugns his claim that he was unfairly\n\n\n\n        6\n       In fraud cases,        the amount of loss attributable to conduct\nrelated to the crimes          of conviction is an important integer in\nestablishing the GSR.         See USSG § 2B1.1; see also United States v.\nCarrasco-De-Jesús, 589        F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\fprejudiced    by    the   later    disclosure      of   the   Greenberg   Traurig\n\nDocuments.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — actions\n\nspeak louder than words.           When the Greenberg Traurig Documents\n\nsurfaced, the defendant did not seek a continuance to determine\n\nwhat effect they might have but, rather, allowed the case to\n\nproceed to sentencing without objection.\n\n            We     have   held    before,    and    today     reaffirm,   that   a\n\ndefendant's claim of unfair surprise at sentencing is \"severely\n\nundermined, if not entirely undone, by his neglect to ask the\n\ndistrict court for a continuance to meet the claimed exigency.\"\n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 47.              It is \"incumbent upon a party\n\nfaced with such a situation to ask explicitly that the court grant\n\nthe time needed to regroup, or waive the point.\"                 Id.   Thus, the\n\ndefendant's response to the belated disclosure of the Greenberg\n\nTraurig Documents dooms his claim of sentencing prejudice.\n\n            We need go no further.          The government's casual approach\n\nto document production in a criminal case is always a matter of\n\nconcern.     Here, however, the belatedly disclosed documents were\n\nsmall potatoes, unlikely to assist the defendant either in his\n\nquest to shift blame to Massad or as a means of shortening his\n\nsentence.     Any possible utility that the documents might have\n\npossessed could have been realized through a continuance, yet\n\ndefendant eschewed that remedy.              The Brady error here, though\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\fregrettable,   resulted      in    no   prejudice     to   the     defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude, without\n\nserious   question,   that   the   district   court    did   not    abuse   its\n\ndiscretion either in rejecting the defendant's Brady claims or in\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 23 -\n\f",

Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Concluding, as we do, that the district court acted appropriately in addressing the delayed disclosure, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We bifurcate our discussion of the background events, first rehearsing the underlying facts and then charting the course of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Scheme.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Refined to its essentials, this case involves a kaleidoscopic stream of misrepresentations and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in client funds. The best way to capture the essence of what transpired is to follow the trail blazed by the indictment, returned on September 28, 2006, which charged the defendant with eighteen counts of mail fraud and two counts of wire fraud. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343.</p>\n<p>From 1997 until 2005, the defendant ran Entrust Capital Management (Entrust), which he held out as the manager of a hedge fund. Entrust and the defendant maintained offices in Worcester, Massachusetts, but the defendant's business partner, Rajeev Johar, worked out of a satellite office in Louisiana.</p>\n<p>The indictment identified fifteen defrauded clients, five of whom testified at trial. Their testimony confirmed the defendant's successful efforts to inveigle them into investing in the hedge fund. These efforts involved the dissemination of hyperbolic marketing literature, daily e-mails, and in-person presentations, all of which were designed to create a false impression that Entrust managed approximately $105,000,000 in assets for more than 300 investors. These claims were wildly exaggerated, and the defendant's persistent boast that Entrust's hedge fund offered high rewards at low risk was unfounded.</p>\n<p>Many potential investors took the bait. To illustrate: The five testifying investors, in the aggregate, entrusted the defendant with roughly $13,500,000 to be invested and managed as part of the hedge fund. One of the five, David Massad, earmarked some additional moneynearly $9,000,000 for specified stock purchases. The defendant's use of these funds failed to comport either with his own representations or with investors' instructions.</p>\n<p>This is how the scheme played out. When the defendant received money earmarked for the hedge fund, he would deposit it into an Entrust account at Commerce Bankan account over which he had exclusive control. Some money from that account was transferred to a brokerage account at Kimball &amp; Cross Investment Management Corp. (K &amp; C). The defendant retained sole transactional authority over this account and funneled money from it into the hedge fund. The money left in the Commerce Bank account remained at the defendant's disposal, and he used much of it for personal purposes.</p>\n<p>Entrust investors were hoodwinked. They received periodic statements (sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly) purporting to describe the status of their investments and the hedge fund's performance. The statements reported, without exception, that the clients' money had been invested in the hedge fund and that the investments had appreciated.</p>\n<p>The statements, taken in the ensemble, show the magnitude of the fraud. Viewed collectively, they represented that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> $13,500,000 had been invested in the hedge fund and that the value of the investment had grown to approximately $18,200,000 by the end of 2004. This figure overstated the actual value of the investment by more than $17,000,000; that is, the investment had <i>depreciated</i> by over ninety percent. The discrepancy between Entrust's apocryphal and authentic balance sheets was accounted for by an array of factors: the hedge fund had incurred (and the defendant had hidden) investment losses in excess of $6,000,000; the defendant had invented $4,700,000 in nonexistent appreciation; and he had diverted more than $5,000,000 in client funds for his own pursuits.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendant's dealings with David Massad were more complicated. Beginning in 2000, Massad (the principal owner of Commerce Bank) gave the defendant checks totaling more than $5,000,000 for investment in the hedge fund. In the summer of 2003, he gave the defendant the further sum of $8,787,000 with instructions to purchase 200,000 shares of GMAC preferred stock and 150,000 shares of Ford Motor Credit preferred stock.</p>\n<p>The monies that Massad committed to the hedge fund suffered much the same fate as the monies committed by other investors. As to the stock purchases, the defendant assured Massad that he had followed his (Massad's) instructions. In fact, he purchased fewer than half of the specified number of shares and pocketed the difference. For well over a year, he nonetheless sent Massad's accountant regular checks purporting to represent quarterly dividends on the shares that Massad thought he had acquired.<sup>[2]</sup> Those checks were meant to disguise the defendant's failure to purchase the specified number of shares for Massad's account.</p>\n<p>From time to time, Massad sought to withdraw sums from his Entrust account. The defendant obliged. But in early 2005, Massad asked to withdraw $7,000,000. The defendant never honored this request.</p>\n<p>At about that time, the defendant learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating him. In response, he contacted his investors and set up a meeting with them. At this meeting, which was held in April of 2005, the defendant urged the investors to destroy the false statements showing gains in their hedge fund accounts and replace them with statements showing losses. He explained, falsely, that the proposal was designed to help them avoid tax liability on their gains, which he disingenuously maintained were still increasing. This artifice drew no takers and, therefore, no investors destroyed their original statements in response to it.</p>\n<p>In the end, Massad and the other investors sustained substantial losses as a result of the defendant's chicanery. The SEC's investigation continued, leading to both criminal and civil proceedings against the defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Aftermath.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This brings us to the defendant's criminal trial, which began on May 5, 2008. The government introduced evidence establishing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> the facts recounted above. In the course of its case in chief, it produced copious evidence corroborating the defendant's role in the fraudulent scheme (including his use of the mails and wire transmissions).</p>\n<p>The defendant premised his defense on two lack-of-knowledge theories. First, he argued that he himself was an innocent dupe whose business partner, Johar, had supplied him with misinformation. Second, he argued that he was somehow a pawn in a broad but ill-defined scheme orchestrated by Massad. The evidence at trial belied both theories. It showed, for example, that the defendant received monthly statements from K &amp; C enumerating the funds actually contained in Entrust's brokerage account. Moreover, the defendant had, on occasion, personally directed the avails of specific (profitable) trades both in the hedge fund and in Entrust's account to his personal accounts. There was no probative evidence of any overarching plot masterminded by Massad.</p>\n<p>We come now to the denouement. On the seventh day of trial (May 13, 2008), the government rested. Immediately prior to resting, it handed over a previously undisclosed memorandum emanating from the SEC investigation (the SEC Memorandum); this document had not come to the prosecutor's attention until that day. The document contained conclusions drawn from interviews with several of the testifying investors.</p>\n<p>With regard to Massad, the SEC Memorandum limned three pieces of information that the defendant characterizes as significant. First, Massad had retained counsel in connection with his financial affairs. Second, Massad had made inconsistent statements concerning the amount of money in his Entrust account. Third, John Sten, an attorney in the law firm of Greenberg Traurig, had represented both Massad and the defendant for some period of time and, during this period, had delivered bogus bank statements to the SEC, ostensibly via a Commerce Bank facsimile machine.</p>\n<p>At the end of that day, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the failure to disclose the SEC Memorandum earlier in the proceedings denied him a fair trial. The government objected and, in an effort to show that the information contained in the SEC Memorandum had previously been turned over, submitted copies of various documents, including SEC interviews of Massad and other investors, that had been given to the defendant's counsel in 2005.</p>\n<p>On May 14, the district court offered to halt the trial and give the defendant time to \"sort . . . out\" the new information, assuring him that he would not be required to proceed until that feat was accomplished. The defendant declined the court's invitation.</p>\n<p>On May 15, the court postponed the trial for another day. It renewed its invitation for a continuance and again offered to allow the defendant to recall any of the government's witnesses for further cross-examination. The defendant refused the offers, and the court then heard arguments on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>On the next day the court, ruling <i>ore tenus,</i> denied the motion. It emphasized the defendant's decision neither to recall any witnesses nor to avail himself of a continuance in order to analyze and follow up on the belatedly disclosed information. It observed that the defendant had pointed to nothing in the new material that would have enabled him to impeach any witness, nor had he identified any other aspect of the material that would have been helpful to his case in any meaningful sense. Following <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> the lawyers' summations and the court's charge, the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward to April 1, 2009. On that date, the defendant moved for a new trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. As part of its opposition, the government disclosed additional materials (the Greenberg Traurig Documents) elaborating upon the information contained in the SEC Memorandum. The prosecution represented that it had obtained the Greenberg Traurig Documents from Attorney John Sten after the defendant claimed to have been ignorant of Sten's dual representation of both Massad and himself. The Greenberg Traurig Documents included end-of-year account statements, on Entrust letterheads and bearing Entrust's Louisiana address, which purported to show losses in Massad's investment account for 2002, 2003, and 2004. They also included a facsimile cover sheet purportedly indicating that the documents had been transmitted from a number at Commerce Bank, as well as a transmittal letter from Sten to the SEC.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the district court held a non-evidentiary hearing. It denied the defendant's new trial motion, concluding that much of the information contained in the SEC Memorandum, as explicated by the Greenberg Traurig Documents, was either irrelevant or immaterial. Although a small fraction of the information might have been used for impeachment purposes, it was of questionable value and incapable of affecting the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>The court then turned to sentencing. The defendant did not object to proceeding on that day, nor did he request a continuance. After further arguments and allocution, the court imposed a 120-month incarcerative term on each count of conviction, to run concurrently. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The defendant contends that the district court erred both in denying his motion for a new trial and in sentencing him too hastily. These plaints rest on the notion that the government failed to satisfy its <i>Brady</i> obligations and thereby prejudiced the defendant. Given the related nature of these plaints, we address them together.</p>\n<p>To gain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a defendant normally must pass a four-part test: he must show that (i) the evidence in question was unknown or unavailable to him at the time of trial; (ii) his failure to learn of it did not result from a lack of due diligence on his part; (iii) the evidence is material; and (iv) the evidence, if available upon retrial, would likely bring about an acquittal. <i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir.1980). When, however, a criminal defendant's new trial motion is premised on the belated disclosure of evidence that should have been made available to him in accordance with the imperatives of <i>Brady,</i> a somewhat less formidable standard applies.</p>\n<p>To obtain the benefit of this more defendant-friendly paradigm, a defendant must make three showings. \"The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory or impeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the government; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)). The first two showings are comparable to the first two requirements of the <i>Wright</i> test.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two standards lies in the replacement of the last two requirements of the <i>Wright</i> test <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> \"with the unitary requirement that the defendant establish `a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 213 (quoting <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). In this context, the Supreme Court has equated \"reasonable probability\" with something sufficient to \"undermine[] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>We have noted two other refinements that distinguish the <i>Brady</i> new trial standard from the ordinary <i>Wright</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 213. First, the probability that a defendant must show does not have to be an \"<i>actual</i> probability that the result would have differed\"; it may be \"a merely theoretical (but still reasonable) probability.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). Second, \"undisclosed impeachment evidence, if it suffices to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial, may carry the day.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375).</p>\n<p>We do not apply these standards directly. In the first instance, that is the responsibility of the trial court. The trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, has a special sense \"of the ebb and flow of the recently concluded trial.\" <i>United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, his views about the likely impact of newly disclosed evidence deserve considerable deference. <i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 211; <i>United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,</i> 489 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2007). For those reasons, we review the challenged rulings in this case for abuse of discretion.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 211; <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir.2000). It is within the confines of this template that we consider whether the late disclosure of either the SEC Memorandum or the Greenberg Traurig Documents warrants relief.</p>\n<p>We start with the arguendo assumption that these materials, which comprised part of the parallel SEC investigation, were constructively in the prosecution's possession. <i>See </i><i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280-81, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (extending the disclosure obligation to materials in the possession of government agents). We also assume, again for argument's sake, that the substance of the materials was not made available to the defendant before trial. These assumptions permit us to narrow the lens of our inquiry to focus on whether the evidence was favorable to the defendant and, if so, whether its dilatory disclosure prejudiced him.</p>\n<p>The defendant asserts that the belatedly disclosed materials would have supported his theory that Massad was not a victim but, rather, was engaged in \"funny business of his own.\" In his view, the SEC Memorandum shows that Massad retained control of his own finances and told inconsistent stories about his dealings with Entrust. Moreover, the Greenberg Traurig Documents can be read to indicate that Massad forwarded bogus statements to the SEC (through Sten). The defendant protests that the timely availability of these materials would have enabled him to impeach Massad. He further insists that the materials have`a potentially exculpatory value because they suggest that (i) Massad <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> was using Sten as part of a plot to manipulate the defendant and to obscure his own malefactions and (ii) Massad and others should be investigated further for potential fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p>The defendant's claim that he could have used the belatedly disclosed materials for impeachment purposes is wishful thinking. The impact of withholding evidence is more severe when it is highly impeaching or when the impeached testimony is essential to the defendant's conviction. <i>United States v. Avilés-Colón,</i> 536 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2008). Here, however, these conditions do not obtain. The defendant's attempt to shift the blame to Massad verges on the chimerical. The impeachment value of the evidence is marginal (necessarily so, given the vagueness of the defendant's allegations), and that value could effectively have been realized by recalling Massad for further cross-examination.</p>\n<p>What is more, the modest impeachment potential of this evidence is diminished by the extensive corroboration of Massad's direct testimony. Like other testifying investors, Massad was able to describe in exquisite detail the losses that he incurred as a result of the defendant's misrepresentations and misappropriations. To buttress this testimony, the government introduced abundant documentary evidence supporting a conclusion that Massad had been victimized. This evidence included phony statements sent by the defendant purporting to show that Massad's instructions had been followed and that Massad's investments had prospered under the defendant's stewardship. Similarly, the government adduced both documentary and testimonial evidence demonstrating that the defendant had sent Massad ersatz dividends on stock that had never been acquired. The amount of money that Massad ultimately lost in his dealings with the defendant bore grim witness to the veracity of Massad's account. And finally, plenitudinous documentary evidence spoke to the defendant's esurient use of client money for personal expenses and his efforts to hide the truth from his clients.<sup>[4]</sup> There was a mountain of incriminating evidence against the defendant. Against this backdrop, the marginal impeachment value of the belatedly disclosed materials was manifestly insufficient to place the trial record in \"such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Even if Massad was engaged in \"funny business of his own\"a dubious premise on this record that fact would not weaken the robust nature of the government's case against the defendant.</p>\n<p>The defendant's separate contention that the belatedly disclosed documents contain exculpatory information is no more persuasive. He claims the materials suggest that Massad employed Sten in furtherance of a contrivance either to manipulate the defendant or to set him up as a scapegoat. This claim lacks any footing in the record. Furthermore, it is sharply undercut by Sten's uncontradicted statement to the government that he spoke to Massad only onceduring a three-way telephone conversation in which the defendant also participated.<sup>[5]</sup> Contrary to the defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> importunings, neither the SEC Memorandum nor the Greenberg Traurig Documents, fairly read, support a lack-of-knowledge defense. These materials simply do not speak, directly or indirectly, to the defendant's claim of innocenceand saying that they do does not make it so.</p>\n<p>We need not probe these points more deeply because, in all events, the defendant has not shown any cognizable prejudice attributable to the late disclosure. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>To begin, the defendant has not identified any plausible strategic option that the delayed disclosure hampered or foreclosed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Misla-Aldarondo,</i> 478 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir.1990). He was not prevented from advancing his dual lack-of-knowledge theories at trial, and his counsel argued those theories vigorously.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the able district court, concerned about whether the late disclosure might inhibit that effort, went to great lengths to ensure that the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to use the new material. The customary remedy for a <i>Brady</i> violation that surfaces mid-trial is a continuance and a concomitant opportunity to analyze the new information and, if necessary, recall witnesses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1989). The court offered precisely this remediation when the SEC Memorandum came to light, but the defendant repeatedly rejected the proffered anodynes. \"Generally, we have viewed the failure to ask for a continuance as an indication that defense counsel was himself satisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\" <i>United States v. Osorio,</i> 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir.1991) (citing <i>United States v. Ingraldi,</i> 793 F.2d 408, 413 (1st Cir.1986)). A fortiori, we can draw a comparable inference from a defendant's outright rejection of a proffered continuance. Such a decision often will reveal, with conspicuous clarity, defense counsel's perception that the belatedly disclosed information was not critical to his client's defense. So it is here.</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the defendant asseverates that the customary remedy was insufficient in the case at hand because the jury already had formed first impressions. Other courts have rejected conclusory arguments along these same lines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Burke,</i> 571 F.3d 1048, 1055-56 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 565, 175 L.Ed.2d 391 (2009); <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 306 F.3d 398, 420-21 (6th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Aichele,</i> 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir.1991). So do we: the defendant never explains why, in this case, first impressions should be regarded as decisive. Thus, accepting his argument would create an exception that would swallow in a single gulp the general rule requiring parties to ask for continuances.</p>\n<p>In a variation on this theme, the defendant suggests that the late disclosure was prejudicial because, if he had the information before trial, he might have negotiated a favorable plea deal. Because he lacked the wherewithal to cast Massad as the villain of the piece, his thesis runs, the government was more sanguine about both the odds of a conviction and the length of the likely sentence. Consequently, it was less amenable to a plea bargain.</p>\n<p>This argument has no traction. The animating principle of <i>Brady</i> is the \"avoidance of an unfair trial.\" <i>Brady,</i> 373 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. It is, therefore, universally acknowledged that the right memorialized in <i>Brady</i> is a trial right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moussaoui,</i> 591 F.3d 263, 285 (4th Cir.2010). Consequently, courts enforce <i>Brady</i> in order \"to minimize the chance that an innocent person [will] be found guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> The core question is whether, despite the suppressed evidence, the accused \"received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p>In urging us to extend <i>Brady's</i> prejudice component to pretrial plea negotiations, the defendant exhorts us to break new ground. He does not cite a single case standing for this novel approach but, rather, relies on authority extolling the importance of plea negotiations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Corbitt v. New Jersey,</i> 439 U.S. 212, 222 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 492, 58 L.Ed.2d 466 (1978). Although we recognize that plea negotiations are important, that fact provides no support for an unprecedented expansion of <i>Brady. See </i><i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> 536 U.S. 622, 632, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (warning that the benefits of plea bargaining would be undermined by an extension of <i>Brady</i> into the pretrial realm).</p>\n<p>The <i>Ruiz</i> Court evinced a reluctance to extend a <i>Brady</i>-like right to the realm of pretrial plea negotiations, holding flatly that \"the Constitution does not require the Government to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 633, 122 S.Ct. 2450. While the Court acknowledged that \"the more information the defendant has, the more aware he is of the likely consequences of a plea,\" it nonetheless concluded that a prosecutor has no obligation \"to share all useful information with the defendant\" during pretrial plea negotiations. <i>Id.</i> at 629, 122 S.Ct. 2450.</p>\n<p><i>Ruiz</i> teaches that <i>Brady</i> does not protect against the possible prejudice that may ensue from the loss of an opportunity to plea-bargain with complete knowledge of all relevant facts. This makes good sense: when a defendant chooses to admit his guilt, <i>Brady</i> concerns subside. <i>Moussaoui,</i> 591 F.3d at 285; <i>see also </i><i>Matthew v. Johnson,</i> 201 F.3d 353, 361 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"The <i>Brady</i> rule's focus on protecting the integrity of trials suggests that where no trial is to occur, there may be no constitutional violation.\"). Here, moreover, nothing in the belatedly disclosed documents suggests that they would have significantly strengthened the defendant's hand in plea negotiations even if they had been available to him from the start. Accordingly, we reject this iteration of the defendant's prejudice argument.</p>\n<p>The defendant has one more shot in his sling. He posits that the disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents a few days prior to sentencing adversely impacted the length of his sentence and the amount of restitution. He says that, given more time, he could have used the belatedly disclosed material to discount Massad's losses and, thus, lower both his guideline sentencing range (GSR) and the amount of restitution assessed.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>There are several flaws in the fabric of this argument. First, it is underdeveloped; beyond some conclusory rhetoric, the defendant does not explain how the Greenberg Traurig Documents, which contained only information tangentially related to Massad's financial transactions and no information at all related to the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> of Massad's actual losses as an Entrust client, would have helped him to overcome the extensive evidence in the record establishing Massad's losses and the defendant's responsibility for them. It is not our job to put flesh on the bare bones of an underdeveloped argument, <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990), and the defendant's plaint could be rejected for that reason alone.</p>\n<p>What is more, the claim of sentencing prejudice is undermined by the earlier production of the SEC Memorandum. That report foreshadowed the information contained in the Greenberg Traurig Documents, and the defendant had it in his possession for many months prior to sentencing. He chose neither to follow up on it nor to use it as a means of attacking the loss and restitution calculations. That history impugns his claim that he was unfairly prejudiced by the later disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents.</p>\n<p>If more were neededand we doubt that it isactions speak louder than words. When the Greenberg Traurig Documents surfaced, the defendant did not seek a continuance to determine what effect they might have but, rather, allowed the case to proceed to sentencing without objection.</p>\n<p>We have held before, and today reaffirm, that a defendant's claim of unfair surprise at sentencing is \"severely undermined, if not entirely undone, by his neglect to ask the district court for a continuance to meet the claimed exigency.\" <i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 47. It is \"incumbent upon a party faced with such a situation to ask explicitly that the court grant the time needed to regroup, or waive the point.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the defendant's response to the belated disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents dooms his claim of sentencing prejudice.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The government's casual approach to document production in a criminal case is always a matter of concern. Here, however, the belatedly disclosed documents were small potatoes, unlikely to assist the defendant either in his quest to shift blame to Massad or as a means of shortening his sentence. Any possible utility that the documents might have possessed could have been realized through a continuance, yet defendant eschewed that remedy. The <i>Brady</i> error here, though regrettable, resulted in no prejudice to the defendant's substantial rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court did not abuse its discretion either in rejecting the defendant's <i>Brady</i> claims or in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The defendant's handling of the funds of Alok Mathur (his blood relative) furnishes a particularly egregious example of his mendacity. Alok Mathur gave the defendant, for investment, the sum of $530,000. None of this money was ever actually invested. Instead, the defendant spent it on jewelry, automobiles, and recreational gambling.</p>\n<p>[2]  The defendant makes much of Massad's use of David Mandara, who was his son-in-law as well as his accountant, as an internuncio. He does not indicate what, if anything, was wrong with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that the defendant failed to preserve his claim of error with respect to the Greenberg Traurig Documents and that, therefore, we should review the rejection of that claim only for plain error. This argument is of dubious force and, in any event, it is unnecessary for us to consider it.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note in passing that Massad's testimony was not essential to the government's case. The government proved that several other investors were bilked by the defendant in much the same way. This is important because a reviewing court should \"evaluate the strength of . . . impeachment evidence and the effect of its suppression in the context of the entire record to determine its materiality.\" <i>Conley v. United States,</i> 415 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[5]  The defendant could, of course, have recalled Massad to inquire into this point, or could have called Sten in his own case. He took no such action.</p>\n<p>[6]  In fraud cases, the amount of loss attributable to conduct related to the crimes of conviction is an important integer in establishing the GSR. <i>See</i> USSG § 2B1.1; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesús,</i> 589 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n\n</div>",

Concluding, as we do, that the district court acted appropriately in addressing the delayed disclosure, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We bifurcate our discussion of the background events, first rehearsing the underlying facts and then charting the course of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Scheme.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Refined to its essentials, this case involves a kaleidoscopic stream of misrepresentations and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in client funds. The best way to capture the essence of what transpired is to follow the trail blazed by the indictment, returned on September 28, 2006, which charged the defendant with eighteen counts of mail fraud and two counts of wire fraud. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343.</p>\n<p>From 1997 until 2005, the defendant ran Entrust Capital Management (Entrust), which he held out as the manager of a hedge fund. Entrust and the defendant maintained offices in Worcester, Massachusetts, but the defendant's business partner, Rajeev Johar, worked out of a satellite office in Louisiana.</p>\n<p>The indictment identified fifteen defrauded clients, five of whom testified at trial. Their testimony confirmed the defendant's successful efforts to inveigle them into investing in the hedge fund. These efforts involved the dissemination of hyperbolic marketing literature, daily e-mails, and in-person presentations, all of which were designed to create a false impression that Entrust managed approximately $105,000,000 in assets for more than 300 investors. These claims were wildly exaggerated, and the defendant's persistent boast that Entrust's hedge fund offered high rewards at low risk was unfounded.</p>\n<p>Many potential investors took the bait. To illustrate: The five testifying investors, in the aggregate, entrusted the defendant with roughly $13,500,000 to be invested and managed as part of the hedge fund. One of the five, David Massad, earmarked some additional moneynearly $9,000,000 for specified stock purchases. The defendant's use of these funds failed to comport either with his own representations or with investors' instructions.</p>\n<p>This is how the scheme played out. When the defendant received money earmarked for the hedge fund, he would deposit it into an Entrust account at Commerce Bankan account over which he had exclusive control. Some money from that account was transferred to a brokerage account at Kimball &amp; Cross Investment Management Corp. (K &amp; C). The defendant retained sole transactional authority over this account and funneled money from it into the hedge fund. The money left in the Commerce Bank account remained at the defendant's disposal, and he used much of it for personal purposes.</p>\n<p>Entrust investors were hoodwinked. They received periodic statements (sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly) purporting to describe the status of their investments and the hedge fund's performance. The statements reported, without exception, that the clients' money had been invested in the hedge fund and that the investments had appreciated.</p>\n<p>The statements, taken in the ensemble, show the magnitude of the fraud. Viewed collectively, they represented that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> $13,500,000 had been invested in the hedge fund and that the value of the investment had grown to approximately $18,200,000 by the end of 2004. This figure overstated the actual value of the investment by more than $17,000,000; that is, the investment had <i>depreciated</i> by over ninety percent. The discrepancy between Entrust's apocryphal and authentic balance sheets was accounted for by an array of factors: the hedge fund had incurred (and the defendant had hidden) investment losses in excess of $6,000,000; the defendant had invented $4,700,000 in nonexistent appreciation; and he had diverted more than $5,000,000 in client funds for his own pursuits.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendant's dealings with David Massad were more complicated. Beginning in 2000, Massad (the principal owner of Commerce Bank) gave the defendant checks totaling more than $5,000,000 for investment in the hedge fund. In the summer of 2003, he gave the defendant the further sum of $8,787,000 with instructions to purchase 200,000 shares of GMAC preferred stock and 150,000 shares of Ford Motor Credit preferred stock.</p>\n<p>The monies that Massad committed to the hedge fund suffered much the same fate as the monies committed by other investors. As to the stock purchases, the defendant assured Massad that he had followed his (Massad's) instructions. In fact, he purchased fewer than half of the specified number of shares and pocketed the difference. For well over a year, he nonetheless sent Massad's accountant regular checks purporting to represent quarterly dividends on the shares that Massad thought he had acquired.<sup>[2]</sup> Those checks were meant to disguise the defendant's failure to purchase the specified number of shares for Massad's account.</p>\n<p>From time to time, Massad sought to withdraw sums from his Entrust account. The defendant obliged. But in early 2005, Massad asked to withdraw $7,000,000. The defendant never honored this request.</p>\n<p>At about that time, the defendant learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating him. In response, he contacted his investors and set up a meeting with them. At this meeting, which was held in April of 2005, the defendant urged the investors to destroy the false statements showing gains in their hedge fund accounts and replace them with statements showing losses. He explained, falsely, that the proposal was designed to help them avoid tax liability on their gains, which he disingenuously maintained were still increasing. This artifice drew no takers and, therefore, no investors destroyed their original statements in response to it.</p>\n<p>In the end, Massad and the other investors sustained substantial losses as a result of the defendant's chicanery. The SEC's investigation continued, leading to both criminal and civil proceedings against the defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Aftermath.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This brings us to the defendant's criminal trial, which began on May 5, 2008. The government introduced evidence establishing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> the facts recounted above. In the course of its case in chief, it produced copious evidence corroborating the defendant's role in the fraudulent scheme (including his use of the mails and wire transmissions).</p>\n<p>The defendant premised his defense on two lack-of-knowledge theories. First, he argued that he himself was an innocent dupe whose business partner, Johar, had supplied him with misinformation. Second, he argued that he was somehow a pawn in a broad but ill-defined scheme orchestrated by Massad. The evidence at trial belied both theories. It showed, for example, that the defendant received monthly statements from K &amp; C enumerating the funds actually contained in Entrust's brokerage account. Moreover, the defendant had, on occasion, personally directed the avails of specific (profitable) trades both in the hedge fund and in Entrust's account to his personal accounts. There was no probative evidence of any overarching plot masterminded by Massad.</p>\n<p>We come now to the denouement. On the seventh day of trial (May 13, 2008), the government rested. Immediately prior to resting, it handed over a previously undisclosed memorandum emanating from the SEC investigation (the SEC Memorandum); this document had not come to the prosecutor's attention until that day. The document contained conclusions drawn from interviews with several of the testifying investors.</p>\n<p>With regard to Massad, the SEC Memorandum limned three pieces of information that the defendant characterizes as significant. First, Massad had retained counsel in connection with his financial affairs. Second, Massad had made inconsistent statements concerning the amount of money in his Entrust account. Third, John Sten, an attorney in the law firm of Greenberg Traurig, had represented both Massad and the defendant for some period of time and, during this period, had delivered bogus bank statements to the SEC, ostensibly via a Commerce Bank facsimile machine.</p>\n<p>At the end of that day, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the failure to disclose the SEC Memorandum earlier in the proceedings denied him a fair trial. The government objected and, in an effort to show that the information contained in the SEC Memorandum had previously been turned over, submitted copies of various documents, including SEC interviews of Massad and other investors, that had been given to the defendant's counsel in 2005.</p>\n<p>On May 14, the district court offered to halt the trial and give the defendant time to \"sort . . . out\" the new information, assuring him that he would not be required to proceed until that feat was accomplished. The defendant declined the court's invitation.</p>\n<p>On May 15, the court postponed the trial for another day. It renewed its invitation for a continuance and again offered to allow the defendant to recall any of the government's witnesses for further cross-examination. The defendant refused the offers, and the court then heard arguments on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>On the next day the court, ruling <i>ore tenus,</i> denied the motion. It emphasized the defendant's decision neither to recall any witnesses nor to avail himself of a continuance in order to analyze and follow up on the belatedly disclosed information. It observed that the defendant had pointed to nothing in the new material that would have enabled him to impeach any witness, nor had he identified any other aspect of the material that would have been helpful to his case in any meaningful sense. Following <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> the lawyers' summations and the court's charge, the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward to April 1, 2009. On that date, the defendant moved for a new trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. As part of its opposition, the government disclosed additional materials (the Greenberg Traurig Documents) elaborating upon the information contained in the SEC Memorandum. The prosecution represented that it had obtained the Greenberg Traurig Documents from Attorney John Sten after the defendant claimed to have been ignorant of Sten's dual representation of both Massad and himself. The Greenberg Traurig Documents included end-of-year account statements, on Entrust letterheads and bearing Entrust's Louisiana address, which purported to show losses in Massad's investment account for 2002, 2003, and 2004. They also included a facsimile cover sheet purportedly indicating that the documents had been transmitted from a number at Commerce Bank, as well as a transmittal letter from Sten to the SEC.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the district court held a non-evidentiary hearing. It denied the defendant's new trial motion, concluding that much of the information contained in the SEC Memorandum, as explicated by the Greenberg Traurig Documents, was either irrelevant or immaterial. Although a small fraction of the information might have been used for impeachment purposes, it was of questionable value and incapable of affecting the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>The court then turned to sentencing. The defendant did not object to proceeding on that day, nor did he request a continuance. After further arguments and allocution, the court imposed a 120-month incarcerative term on each count of conviction, to run concurrently. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The defendant contends that the district court erred both in denying his motion for a new trial and in sentencing him too hastily. These plaints rest on the notion that the government failed to satisfy its <i>Brady</i> obligations and thereby prejudiced the defendant. Given the related nature of these plaints, we address them together.</p>\n<p>To gain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a defendant normally must pass a four-part test: he must show that (i) the evidence in question was unknown or unavailable to him at the time of trial; (ii) his failure to learn of it did not result from a lack of due diligence on his part; (iii) the evidence is material; and (iv) the evidence, if available upon retrial, would likely bring about an acquittal. <i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v.

When, however, a criminal defendant's new trial motion is premised on the belated disclosure of evidence that should have been made available to him in accordance with the imperatives of <i>Brady,</i> a somewhat less formidable standard applies.</p>\n<p>To obtain the benefit of this more defendant-friendly paradigm, a defendant must make three showings. \"The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory or impeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the government; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>United States v.

The first two showings are comparable to the first two requirements of the <i>Wright</i> test.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two standards lies in the replacement of the last two requirements of the <i>Wright</i> test <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> \"with the unitary requirement that the defendant establish `a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 213 (quoting <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (1985)). In this context, the Supreme Court has equated \"reasonable probability\" with something sufficient to \"undermine[] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 434, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (1995) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>We have noted two other refinements that distinguish the <i>Brady</i> new trial standard from the ordinary <i>Wright</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 213. First, the probability that a defendant must show does not have to be an \"<i>actual</i> probability that the result would have differed\"; it may be \"a merely theoretical (but still reasonable) probability.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). Second, \"undisclosed impeachment evidence, if it suffices to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial, may carry the day.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 682, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3375</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>We do not apply these standards directly. In the first instance, that is the responsibility of the trial court. The trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, has a special sense \"of the ebb and flow of the recently concluded trial.\" <i>United States v. Natanel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, his views about the likely impact of newly disclosed evidence deserve considerable deference. <i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 211; <i>United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202775\"><a href=\"/opinion/202775/united-states-v-maldonado-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2007). For those reasons, we review the challenged rulings in this case for abuse of discretion.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d at 211; <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 486 (1st Cir.2000). It is within the confines of this template that we consider whether the late disclosure of either the SEC Memorandum or the Greenberg Traurig Documents warrants relief.</p>\n<p>We start with the arguendo assumption that these materials, which comprised part of the parallel SEC investigation, were constructively in the prosecution's possession. <i>See </i><i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1936</span></a></span> (extending the disclosure obligation to materials in the possession of government agents). We also assume, again for argument's sake, that the substance of the materials was not made available to the defendant before trial. These assumptions permit us to narrow the lens of our inquiry to focus on whether the evidence was favorable to the defendant and, if so, whether its dilatory disclosure prejudiced him.</p>\n<p>The defendant asserts that the belatedly disclosed materials would have supported his theory that Massad was not a victim but, rather, was engaged in \"funny business of his own.\" In his view, the SEC Memorandum shows that Massad retained control of his own finances and told inconsistent stories about his dealings with Entrust. Moreover, the Greenberg Traurig Documents can be read to indicate that Massad forwarded bogus statements to the SEC (through Sten). The defendant protests that the timely availability of these materials would have enabled him to impeach Massad. He further insists that the materials have`a potentially exculpatory value because they suggest that (i) Massad <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> was using Sten as part of a plot to manipulate the defendant and to obscure his own malefactions and (ii) Massad and others should be investigated further for potential fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p>The defendant's claim that he could have used the belatedly disclosed materials for impeachment purposes is wishful thinking. The impact of withholding evidence is more severe when it is highly impeaching or when the impeached testimony is essential to the defendant's conviction. <i>United States v. Avilés-Colón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203414\"><a href=\"/opinion/203414/united-states-v-aviles-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2008). Here, however, these conditions do not obtain. The defendant's attempt to shift the blame to Massad verges on the chimerical. The impeachment value of the evidence is marginal (necessarily so, given the vagueness of the defendant's allegations), and that value could effectively have been realized by recalling Massad for further cross-examination.</p>\n<p>What is more, the modest impeachment potential of this evidence is diminished by the extensive corroboration of Massad's direct testimony. Like other testifying investors, Massad was able to describe in exquisite detail the losses that he incurred as a result of the defendant's misrepresentations and misappropriations. To buttress this testimony, the government introduced abundant documentary evidence supporting a conclusion that Massad had been victimized. This evidence included phony statements sent by the defendant purporting to show that Massad's instructions had been followed and that Massad's investments had prospered under the defendant's stewardship. Similarly, the government adduced both documentary and testimonial evidence demonstrating that the defendant had sent Massad ersatz dividends on stock that had never been acquired. The amount of money that Massad ultimately lost in his dealings with the defendant bore grim witness to the veracity of Massad's account. And finally, plenitudinous documentary evidence spoke to the defendant's esurient use of client money for personal expenses and his efforts to hide the truth from his clients.<sup>[4]</sup> There was a mountain of incriminating evidence against the defendant. Against this backdrop, the marginal impeachment value of the belatedly disclosed materials was manifestly insufficient to place the trial record in \"such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>. Even if Massad was engaged in \"funny business of his own\"a dubious premise on this record that fact would not weaken the robust nature of the government's case against the defendant.</p>\n<p>The defendant's separate contention that the belatedly disclosed documents contain exculpatory information is no more persuasive. He claims the materials suggest that Massad employed Sten in furtherance of a contrivance either to manipulate the defendant or to set him up as a scapegoat. This claim lacks any footing in the record. Furthermore, it is sharply undercut by Sten's uncontradicted statement to the government that he spoke to Massad only onceduring a three-way telephone conversation in which the defendant also participated.<sup>[5]</sup> Contrary to the defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> importunings, neither the SEC Memorandum nor the Greenberg Traurig Documents, fairly read, support a lack-of-knowledge defense. These materials simply do not speak, directly or indirectly, to the defendant's claim of innocenceand saying that they do does not make it so.</p>\n<p>We need not probe these points more deeply because, in all events, the defendant has not shown any cognizable prejudice attributable to the late disclosure. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>To begin, the defendant has not identified any plausible strategic option that the delayed disclosure hampered or foreclosed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Misla-Aldarondo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796946\"><a href=\"/opinion/796946/united-states-v-edison-misla-aldarondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Devin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551278\"><a href=\"/opinion/551278/united-states-v-francis-e-devin/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 290 (1st Cir.1990). He was not prevented from advancing his dual lack-of-knowledge theories at trial, and his counsel argued those theories vigorously.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the able district court, concerned about whether the late disclosure might inhibit that effort, went to great lengths to ensure that the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to use the new material. The customary remedy for a <i>Brady</i> violation that surfaces mid-trial is a continuance and a concomitant opportunity to analyze the new information and, if necessary, recall witnesses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1178 (1st Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1989). The court offered precisely this remediation when the SEC Memorandum came to light, but the defendant repeatedly rejected the proffered anodynes. \"Generally, we have viewed the failure to ask for a continuance as an indication that defense counsel was himself satisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\" <i>United States v. Osorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558564\"><a href=\"/opinion/558564/united-states-v-lorenzo-osorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 758 (1st Cir.1991) (citing <i>United States v. Ingraldi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471758\"><a href=\"/opinion/471758/united-states-v-peter-f-ingraldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 413 (1st Cir.1986)). A fortiori, we can draw a comparable inference from a defendant's outright rejection of a proffered continuance. Such a decision often will reveal, with conspicuous clarity, defense counsel's perception that the belatedly disclosed information was not critical to his client's defense. So it is here.</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the defendant asseverates that the customary remedy was insufficient in the case at hand because the jury already had formed first impressions. Other courts have rejected conclusory arguments along these same lines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Burke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172381\"><a href=\"/opinion/172381/united-states-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1055-56 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span> (2009); <i>United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779376\"><a href=\"/opinion/779376/united-states-v-david-devon-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 420-21 (6th Cir.2002); <i>United States v.

So do we: the defendant never explains why, in this case, first impressions should be regarded as decisive. Thus, accepting his argument would create an exception that would swallow in a single gulp the general rule requiring parties to ask for continuances.</p>\n<p>In a variation on this theme, the defendant suggests that the late disclosure was prejudicial because, if he had the information before trial, he might have negotiated a favorable plea deal. Because he lacked the wherewithal to cast Massad as the villain of the piece, his thesis runs, the government was more sanguine about both the odds of a conviction and the length of the likely sentence. Consequently, it was less amenable to a plea bargain.</p>\n<p>This argument has no traction. The animating principle of <i>Brady</i> is the \"avoidance of an unfair trial.\" <i>Brady,</i> 373 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> U.S. at 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>. It is, therefore, universally acknowledged that the right memorialized in <i>Brady</i> is a trial right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moussaoui,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463880/united-states-v-moussaoui/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 285 (4th Cir.2010). Consequently, courts enforce <i>Brady</i> in order \"to minimize the chance that an innocent person [will] be found guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> The core question is whether, despite the suppressed evidence, the accused \"received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 434, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In urging us to extend <i>Brady's</i> prejudice component to pretrial plea negotiations, the defendant exhorts us to break new ground. He does not cite a single case standing for this novel approach but, rather, relies on authority extolling the importance of plea negotiations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Corbitt v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109956\"><a href=\"/opinion/109956/corbitt-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 222 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109956\"><a href=\"/opinion/109956/corbitt-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109956\"><a href=\"/opinion/109956/corbitt-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span> (1978). Although we recognize that plea negotiations are important, that fact provides no support for an unprecedented expansion of <i>Brady. See </i><i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121166\"><a href=\"/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 632, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121166\"><a href=\"/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2450</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121166\"><a href=\"/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span> (2002) (warning that the benefits of plea bargaining would be undermined by an extension of <i>Brady</i> into the pretrial realm).</p>\n<p>The <i>Ruiz</i> Court evinced a reluctance to extend a <i>Brady</i>-like right to the realm of pretrial plea negotiations, holding flatly that \"the Constitution does not require the Government to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 633, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121166\"><a href=\"/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2450</span></a></span>. While the Court acknowledged that \"the more information the defendant has, the more aware he is of the likely consequences of a plea,\" it nonetheless concluded that a prosecutor has no obligation \"to share all useful information with the defendant\" during pretrial plea negotiations. <i>Id.</i> at 629, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121166\"><a href=\"/opinion/121166/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2450</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>Ruiz</i> teaches that <i>Brady</i> does not protect against the possible prejudice that may ensue from the loss of an opportunity to plea-bargain with complete knowledge of all relevant facts. This makes good sense: when a defendant chooses to admit his guilt, <i>Brady</i> concerns subside. <i>Moussaoui,</i> 591 F.3d at 285; <i>see also </i><i>Matthew v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19777\"><a href=\"/opinion/19777/matthew-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>, 361 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"The <i>Brady</i> rule's focus on protecting the integrity of trials suggests that where no trial is to occur, there may be no constitutional violation.\"). Here, moreover, nothing in the belatedly disclosed documents suggests that they would have significantly strengthened the defendant's hand in plea negotiations even if they had been available to him from the start. Accordingly, we reject this iteration of the defendant's prejudice argument.</p>\n<p>The defendant has one more shot in his sling. He posits that the disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents a few days prior to sentencing adversely impacted the length of his sentence and the amount of restitution. He says that, given more time, he could have used the belatedly disclosed material to discount Massad's losses and, thus, lower both his guideline sentencing range (GSR) and the amount of restitution assessed.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>There are several flaws in the fabric of this argument. First, it is underdeveloped; beyond some conclusory rhetoric, the defendant does not explain how the Greenberg Traurig Documents, which contained only information tangentially related to Massad's financial transactions and no information at all related to the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> of Massad's actual losses as an Entrust client, would have helped him to overcome the extensive evidence in the record establishing Massad's losses and the defendant's responsibility for them. It is not our job to put flesh on the bare bones of an underdeveloped argument, <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990), and the defendant's plaint could be rejected for that reason alone.</p>\n<p>What is more, the claim of sentencing prejudice is undermined by the earlier production of the SEC Memorandum. That report foreshadowed the information contained in the Greenberg Traurig Documents, and the defendant had it in his possession for many months prior to sentencing. He chose neither to follow up on it nor to use it as a means of attacking the loss and restitution calculations. That history impugns his claim that he was unfairly prejudiced by the later disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents.</p>\n<p>If more were neededand we doubt that it isactions speak louder than words. When the Greenberg Traurig Documents surfaced, the defendant did not seek a continuance to determine what effect they might have but, rather, allowed the case to proceed to sentencing without objection.</p>\n<p>We have held before, and today reaffirm, that a defendant's claim of unfair surprise at sentencing is \"severely undermined, if not entirely undone, by his neglect to ask the district court for a continuance to meet the claimed exigency.\" <i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 47. It is \"incumbent upon a party faced with such a situation to ask explicitly that the court grant the time needed to regroup, or waive the point.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the defendant's response to the belated disclosure of the Greenberg Traurig Documents dooms his claim of sentencing prejudice.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The government's casual approach to document production in a criminal case is always a matter of concern. Here, however, the belatedly disclosed documents were small potatoes, unlikely to assist the defendant either in his quest to shift blame to Massad or as a means of shortening his sentence. Any possible utility that the documents might have possessed could have been realized through a continuance, yet defendant eschewed that remedy. The <i>Brady</i> error here, though regrettable, resulted in no prejudice to the defendant's substantial rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court did not abuse its discretion either in rejecting the defendant's <i>Brady</i> claims or in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The defendant's handling of the funds of Alok Mathur (his blood relative) furnishes a particularly egregious example of his mendacity. Alok Mathur gave the defendant, for investment, the sum of $530,000. None of this money was ever actually invested. Instead, the defendant spent it on jewelry, automobiles, and recreational gambling.</p>\n<p>[2]  The defendant makes much of Massad's use of David Mandara, who was his son-in-law as well as his accountant, as an internuncio. He does not indicate what, if anything, was wrong with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that the defendant failed to preserve his claim of error with respect to the Greenberg Traurig Documents and that, therefore, we should review the rejection of that claim only for plain error. This argument is of dubious force and, in any event, it is unnecessary for us to consider it.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note in passing that Massad's testimony was not essential to the government's case. The government proved that several other investors were bilked by the defendant in much the same way. This is important because a reviewing court should \"evaluate the strength of . . . impeachment evidence and the effect of its suppression in the context of the entire record to determine its materiality.\" <i>Conley v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201715\"><a href=\"/opinion/201715/conley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 189 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[5]  The defendant could, of course, have recalled Massad to inquire into this point, or could have called Sten in his own case. He took no such action.</p>\n<p>[6]  In fraud cases, the amount of loss attributable to conduct related to the crimes of conviction is an important integer in establishing the GSR. <i>See</i> USSG § 2B1.1; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesús,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204099\"><a href=\"/opinion/204099/united-states-v-carrasco-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n\n</div>",
