Appellant/claimant Kenneth Gentle  appeals\n               \n\nthe affirmance by  the district  court of the  denial by  the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human  Service of his application for\n\ndisability  insurance  benefits  and   supplemental  security\n\nincome.  Gentle, who has a long history of drug and substance\n\nabuse, sustained a work  related injury to his lower  back in\n\n1989.   After the  Social Security Administration  denied his\n\nrequest   for  benefits, a  hearing was  conducted before  an\n\nAdministrative Law Judge [ALJ]  in 1991.  The ALJ  determined\n\nthat medical  evidence established that  claimant had \"severe\n\nchronic  low back pain, a  history of substance  abuse, and a\n\nborderline personality disorder.\"    Applying the  sequential\n\nanalysis  set  forth  in  20  C.F.R.      404.1520,  see also\n                                                             \n\nGoodermote  v. Secretary  of Health  and Human  Services, 690\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  5,  6-7  (1st Cir.  1982),  the  ALJ  found that  these\n\nconditions  constituted  a  severe  impairment  but were  not\n\ndeemed to be presumptively disabling since they  did not meet\n\nor equal any impairment found in the Listings of Impairments,\n\n20 C.F.R.  Part 404,  Subpart P,  Appendix 1.   The ALJ  also\n\ndetermined that, in light  of these impairments, Gentle could\n\nnot  perform his past work.   However, the  ALJ did find that\n\nGentle  retained  the \"residual  functional capacity  for the\n\nfull range of sedentary work  . . . reduced [only] by  a need\n\nto  alternate between  sitting  or standing.\"   A  vocational\n\nexpert  [VE] identified various skilled and semi-skilled jobs\n\n                             -2-\n\nwhich  could be performed sitting or standing at will.  Based\n\non Gentle's  exertional capacity for sedentary  work, as well\n\nas his  age, education  and work experience,  \"in conjunction\n\nwith   claimant's   non-exertional   impairments,\"  the   ALJ\n\nconcluded that  Gentle was  \"not disabled\" and  could perform\n\nthe semi-skilled  and unskilled  jobs the VE  had identified.\n\nWe  review  this decision  only  to determine  whether  it is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in  the record as a  whole.\n\n42  U.S.C.   405(g); Irlanda  Ortiz v. Secretary  of Health &amp;\n                                                             \n\nHuman Services, 955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991).\n              \n\n     Gentle  argues first that the ALJ erred in relying on an\n\nincorrect definition of sedentary  work in her  determination\n\nthat  he was  not disabled.   According to  Gentle, sedentary\n\nwork  requires the ability to  sit for long  period of times,\n\nwhereas  the ALJ found that Gentle  was required to alternate\n\nbetween sitting and standing.  Gentle relies in particular on\n\nSocial Security  Ruling [SSR]  83-12, which states,  in part,\n\nthat  an individual  who must  alternate between  sitting and\n\nstanding  is \"not  functionally capable  of doing  . .  . the\n\nprolonged sitting contemplated in the definition of sedentary\n\nwork.\"   See  also Rosado  v. Secretary  of Health  and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 807  F.2d 292, 293 (1st Cir.  1986) (quoting Shiner\n                                                             \n\nv.  Heckler, 608 F. Supp.  481, 484 (D.  Mass. 1985) (quoting\n           \n\nBenko  v. Schweiker, 551 F.  Supp. 698, 704  (D. N.H. 1982)))\n                   \n\n(\"'a  determination  that  a  claimant  is  able  to  perform\n\n                             -3-\n\nsedentary work \"must  be predicated upon  a finding that  the\n\nclaimant   can  sit   most  of   the  day,   with  occasional\n\ninterruptions of short duration\"'\").    He further notes that\n\nthe  ALJ found  him  capable of  performing semi-skilled  and\n\nunskilled jobs.   Yet,  according to SSR  83-12, \"[u]nskilled\n\njobs  are particularly  structured  so that  a person  cannot\n\nordinarily sit or stand at will.\" \n\n     Gentle's argument is misdirected.  The ALJ  did not find\n\nthat Gentle could do a full range of sedentary work.  Rather,\n\nshe  found that Gentle was  not disabled because  he could do\n\nthe jobs the  VE had  identified.  Moreover,  in making  this\n\nfinding, the ALJ followed the directives of SSR 83-12.   In a\n\nsituation like  Gentle's where a claimant  needs to alternate\n\npositions, SSR  83-12 requires the ALJ  to determine, through\n\nthe evidence  of  a  VE,  whether sufficient  jobs  within  a\n\nclaimant's limited  range  of sedentary  work are  available.\n\nSee  SSR 83-12 (\"In cases of unusual limitation of ability to\n   \n\nsit  or  stand, a  [VE] should  be  consulted to  clarify the\n\nimplications for  the occupational  base.\").  Similarly,  the\n\nreference in  SSR 83-12  to unskilled jobs'  not \"ordinarily\"\n\nallowing for such alteration seems  to invite VE testimony as\n\nto  specific jobs the claimant could perform.  In the instant\n\ncase, the  ALJ specifically asked  the VE to  list \"unskilled\n\njobs where you could sit or stand at will.\"  In response, the\n\nVE listed several types of jobs  that could be performed by a\n\n                             -4-\n\nperson with claimant's need  to alternate between sitting and\n\nstanding.   The procedure outlined in SSR 83-12 was followed.\n\nWe find  no error  in the  ALJ's determination  that Gentle's\n\nexertional  impairments did  not prevent him  from performing\n\nsedentary jobs allowing for alteration of position.1\n\n     Gentle's  second contention  is  that the  ALJ erred  in\n\nimplicitly  finding  that his  nonexertional impairments--his\n\npersonality  disorder and  drug abuse--did  not significantly\n\nlimit  the range  of sedentary  work which he  could perform.\n\nWhile the  issue is  close, we  find  no error  in the  ALJ's\n\ndetermination.\n\n      Unskilled work of the sort  Gentle was found capable of\n\nperforming requires,  inter alia,  the \"ability to  cope with\n                                \n\nthe demands  of any  work environment.\"   Irlanda  Ortiz, 955\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 770; see also SSR 85-15 (listing  mental requirements\n                     \n\nfor unskilled  work).   Medical evidence was  presented which\n\nindicates that  Gentle's potential occupational  base was  at\n\nleast  marginally eroded by impairments affecting his ability\n\nin   this  area.    First,  a  report  by  Dr.  Daniels,  the\n\nSecretary's  consultative, non-examining  psychiatrist, found\n\nthat  Gentle was  moderately limited  in his  ability (1)  to\n\ninteract appropriately with the general public; (2) to accept\n\ninstructions  and  respond  appropriately  to  criticism from\n\n                    \n\n1.  Our  decision in  Rosado  is distinguishable  in that  in\n                            \nRosado there was no  evidence from a vocational expert  as to\n      \nthe range of the work the claimant could perform.\n\n                             -5-\n\nsupervisors; and (3)  to get  along with  coworkers or  peers\n\nwithout  distracting them or  exhibiting behavior  extremes. \n\nDr. Daniels also found that Gentle had a \"moderate\" degree of\n\ndifficulty in maintaining  social functioning and  a \"history\n\nof personality  problems with  difficulty relating to  others\n\nesp[ecially]   authority   figures  and   esp[ecially]  under\n\nstressful  circumstances.\"    Similarly  Dr.  Shea,  Gentle's\n\ntreating  clinical psychologist,  found that  he had  \"a long\n\nhistory  of difficulty  in  interpersonal relationships  that\n\nhave been characterized by  defensiveness, argumentativeness,\n\ndemandingness  and  combativeness especially  while substance\n\nabusing.\"  Both Dr. Daniels and Dr. Shea noted that substance\n\nabuse had been an ongoing problem for Gentle.\n\n     This  evidence of  moderate limitations  in coping  with\n\nothers  arguably  would  have  supported  a  conclusion  that\n\nGentle's mental impairments were significant and affected his\n\ncapacity for  the  jobs which  he  was otherwise  capable  of\n\nperforming.   Nevertheless, other evidence supports the ALJ's\n\ndetermination  that these  impairments did  not significantly\n\nreduce  Gentle's residual  capacity for  unskilled work.   In\n\nsuch circumstances, the Secretary's  decision must be upheld.\n\nIrlanda Ortiz, 955 F.2d at 770.\n             \n\n     Dr. Daniels  found  that although  Gentle  had  moderate\n\ndifficulty in  maintaining social functioning,  he had  never\n\nhad any episodes of deterioration or decompensation in a work\n\n                             -6-\n\nor work-like setting.  More importantly,  Dr. Shea, with whom\n\nGentle had been undergoing therapy for over five years, found\n\nthat Gentle's difficulties in interpersonal relationships and\n\nhis   problems  with   substance  abuse  had   improved  with\n\ntreatment.  Even  though some  of the problems  had begun  to\n\nreemerge after Gentle's injury  in 1989, Dr. Shea anticipated\n\nthat  \"with  adequate program  and  vocational rehabilitation\n\nincluding  job  placement .  . .  [Gentle]  would be  able to\n                         \n\nfunction both in vocational  and social roles more adequately\n\nthan  at present.\"  (Emphasis added).  In Dr. Shea's opinion,\n\nshould Gentle not regain \"some vocational stability including\n\nfull  time  employment,\" he  had  a  high risk  of  suffering\n\nfurther deterioration in  his interpersonal difficulties  and\n\nof  returning  to a  pattern of  substance  abuse.   In other\n\nwords, Gentle's own treating  psychologist not only found him\n\ncapable  of returning  to employment  but even  found  that a\n\nfailure  to return  to work  would likely  be psychologically\n\nharmful to him.  In light of this evidence, the Secretary did\n\nnot  err in  determining that  Gentle's  nonexertional mental\n\nimpairments did not  preclude him from being able  to perform\n\nthe  jobs  the  VE had  identified.    See  id. (even  though\n                                              \n\nevidence showed claimant was moderately limited in ability to\n\ncope with work environment, no error in finding claimant able\n\nto perform full range of sedentary work since  other evidence\n\n                             -7-\n\nsupported conclusion that claimant's capacity  for full range\n\nof such work was not significantly reduced).  \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -8-\n",

Gentle, who has a long history of drug and substance abuse, sustained a work related injury to his lower back in 1989.  After the Social Security Administration denied his request for benefits, a hearing was conducted before an Administrative Law Judge [ALJ] in 1991.  The ALJ determined that medical evidence established that claimant had \"severe chronic low back pain, a history of substance abuse, and a borderline personality disorder.\"  Applying the sequential analysis set forth in 20 C.F.R. Secs. 404.1520,  see also Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409370\"><a href=\"/opinion/409370/william-edward-goodermote-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1982), the ALJ found that these conditions constituted a severe impairment but were not deemed to be presumptively disabling since they did not meet or equal any impairment found in the Listings of Impairments, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. The ALJ also determined that, in light of these impairments, Gentle could not perform his past work.  However, the ALJ did find that Gentle retained the \"residual functional capacity for the full range of sedentary work ... reduced [only] by a need to alternate between sitting or standing.\"  A vocational expert [VE] identified various skilled and semi-skilled jobs which could be performed sitting or standing at will.  Based on Gentle's exertional capacity for sedentary work, as well as his age, education and work experience, \"in conjunction with claimant's non-exertional impairments,\" the ALJ concluded that Gentle was \"not disabled\" and could perform the semi-skilled and unskilled jobs the VE had identified.  We review this decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(g);   Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577108\"><a href=\"/opinion/577108/victor-j-irlanda-ortiz-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gentle argues first that the ALJ erred in relying on an incorrect definition of sedentary work in her determination that he was not disabled.  According to Gentle, sedentary work requires the ability to sit for long period of times, whereas the ALJ found that Gentle was required to alternate between sitting and standing.  Gentle relies in particular on Social Security Ruling [SSR] 83-12, which states, in part, that an individual who must alternate between sitting and standing is \"not functionally capable of doing ... the prolonged sitting contemplated in the definition of sedentary work.\"   See also Rosado v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480547\"><a href=\"/opinion/480547/16-socsecrepser-49-unemplinsrep-cch-17113-miguel-a-rosado-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 293 (1st Cir. 1986) (quoting  Shiner v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1464733\"><a href=\"/opinion/1464733/shiner-v-heckler/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 704 (D. N.H. 1982))) (\" 'a determination that a claimant is able to perform sedentary work \"must be predicated upon a finding that the claimant can sit most of the day, with occasional interruptions of short duration\" ' \").  He further notes that the ALJ found him capable of performing semi-skilled and unskilled jobs.  Yet, according to SSR 83-12, \"[u]nskilled jobs are particularly structured so that a person cannot ordinarily sit or stand at will.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gentle's argument is misdirected.  The ALJ did not find that Gentle could do a full range of sedentary work.  Rather, she found that Gentle was not disabled because he could do the jobs the VE had identified.  Moreover, in making this finding, the ALJ followed the directives of SSR 83-12.  In a situation like Gentle's where a claimant needs to alternate positions, SSR 83-12 requires the ALJ to determine, through the evidence of a VE, whether sufficient jobs within a claimant's limited range of sedentary work are available.  See SSR 83-12 (\"In cases of unusual limitation of ability to sit or stand, a[VE] should be consulted to clarify the implications for the occupational base.\").  Similarly, the reference in SSR 83-12 to unskilled jobs' not \"ordinarily\" allowing for such alteration seems to invite VE testimony as to specific jobs the claimant could perform.  In the instant case, the ALJ specifically asked the VE to list \"unskilled jobs where you could sit or stand at will.\"  In response, the VE listed several types of jobs that could be performed by a person with claimant's need to alternate between sitting and standing.  The procedure outlined in SSR 83-12 was followed.  We find no error in the ALJ's determination that Gentle's exertional impairments did not prevent him from performing sedentary jobs allowing for alteration of position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gentle's second contention is that the ALJ erred in implicitly finding that his nonexertional impairments-his personality disorder and drug abuse-did not significantly limit the range of sedentary work which he could perform.  While the issue is close, we find no error in the ALJ's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unskilled work of the sort Gentle was found capable of performing requires, inter alia, the \"ability to cope with the demands of any work environment.\"  Irlanda Ortiz, 955 F.2d at 770;  see also SSR 85-15 (listing mental requirements for unskilled work).  Medical evidence was presented which indicates that Gentle's potential occupational base was at least marginally eroded by impairments affecting his ability in this area.  First, a report by Dr. Daniels, the Secretary's consultative, non-examining psychiatrist, found that Gentle was moderately limited in his ability (1) to interact appropriately with the general public;  (2) to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors;  and (3) to get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavior extremes.  Dr. Daniels also found that Gentle had a \"moderate\" degree of difficulty in maintaining social functioning and a \"history of personality problems with difficulty relating to others esp[ecially] authority figures and esp[ecially] under stressful circumstances.\"  Similarly Dr. Shea, Gentle's treating clinical psychologist, found that he had \"a long history of difficulty in interpersonal relationships that have been characterized by defensiveness, argumentativeness, demandingness and combativeness especially while substance abusing.\"  Both Dr.  Daniels and Dr. Shea noted that substance abuse had been an ongoing problem for Gentle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence of moderate limitations in coping with others arguably would have supported a conclusion that Gentle's mental impairments were significant and affected his capacity for the jobs which he was otherwise capable of performing.  Nevertheless, other evidence supports the ALJ's determination that these impairments did not significantly reduce Gentle's residual capacity for unskilled work.  In such circumstances, the Secretary's decision must be upheld.  Irlanda Ortiz, 955 F.2d at 770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Daniels found that although Gentle had moderate difficulty in maintaining social functioning, he had never had any episodes of deterioration or decompensation in a work or work-like setting.  More importantly, Dr. Shea, with whom Gentle had been undergoing therapy for over five years, found that Gentle's difficulties in interpersonal relationships and his problems with substance abuse had improved with treatment.  Even though some of the problems had begun to reemerge after Gentle's injury in 1989, Dr. Shea anticipated that \"with adequate program and vocational rehabilitation including job placement ... [Gentle] would be able to function both in vocational and social roles more adequately than at present.\"  (Emphasis added).  In Dr. Shea's opinion, should Gentle not regain \"some vocational stability including full time employment,\" he had a high risk of suffering further deterioration in his interpersonal difficulties and of returning to a pattern of substance abuse.  In other words, Gentle's own treating psychologist not only found him capable of returning to employment but even found that a failure to return to work would likely be psychologically harmful to him.  In light of this evidence, the Secretary did not err in determining that Gentle's nonexertional mental impairments did not preclude him from being able to perform the jobs the VE had identified.
