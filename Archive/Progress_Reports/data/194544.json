We\n     \nagree  with  the  majority that  we  should  not  grant this\npetition  for  en banc  review.   But,  that is  because the\nparticular  facts of this case do not compel us to reach the\nmajor  legal issue that petitioners would  like to raise, an\nissue that  we  believe is  important.   The  panel  opinion\npoints  out that  an  indictment charging  a conspiracy  \"to\ndefraud the United States,\"  18 U.S.C.   371, must  do more,\nin this case, than simply charge a conspiracy, an overt act,\nand the  object of \"impairing, obstructing  or defeating the\nlawful function of any  department of Government.\"  It  must\nalso charge improper means, means\n\nthat   the   panel  describes   as   \"affirmative  acts   of\nmisrepresentation  and  deceit.\"    Is this  description  of\nimproper means overly broad?  Would it permit prosecutors to\ncast their criminal net too wide?  After all, \"do good; shun\nevil,\" while sound moral advice, is not appropriate language\nfor a criminal statute.\n\n          More  specifically, must  the  improper means  (in\ncases  like the one before us) include conduct that not only\nis deceitful,  but also is of  a kind that  the law normally\nindependently  forbids?    Without  some  such  requirement,\nSection  371  would  seem  to criminalize  conduct  that  an\noffender, in advance, could reasonably have believed was not\ncriminal.  (Imagine,  for   example,  officials  of  non-MBE\nCompany A who  lie to  officials of MBE  Company B,  causing\nthem to miss an important bid deadline, so that the contract\nis awarded to Company A rather than Company B).  At the same\ntime, the \"other law\"  requirement need not necessarily mean\nother  federal criminal  laws; other  laws, including  state\n                       \ncriminal laws,  and, perhaps,  certain civil laws,  can make\nclear to potential offenders that certain types of specified\nconduct are both dishonest and forbidden.  Nor need one read\nSection  371 as  requiring  a prosecutor  to  prove all  the\nelements of  a violation of the other law.  It might well be\nsufficient  to show an instance of the basic type of conduct\n                                                 \nthat the  other law  forbids, rather than  proving secondary\nmatters, such as actual  effects, or more technical matters,\nsuch  as statutes of limitations.   The merits  of some such\n\"other  law\" requirement, and its consistency with precedent\non the subject, seem to me to warrant argument.\n\n          We  have not asked  for argument, however, because\nthe  information,  as  described  by the  panel,  meets  the\ncriteria suggested above.   The information makes clear that\nthe \"affirmative acts of  misrepresentation and deceit\" here\nat  issue   involve  conduct  that  in   all  likelihood  is\nindependently criminal.   The government  alleges that  \"MBE\ncontracts can only be  awarded to MBE's who actually  do the\nwork,\" it says that Rusco did not do any of the work, and it\nsays  that  Rusco  submitted false  documentation  to  state\ncertifying agencies which documentation \"contained false and\nmisleading information and material omissions which directly\naffected Rusco's eligibility.\"  Fairly read, the information\nsays that  the defendant aided Rusco  in telling significant\nlies to state agencies  in order to obtain from  the federal\ngovernment money that it  would not otherwise have obtained.\nThis is conduct of the kind that criminal  statutes normally\nforbid. Also, the essence of the conduct which occurred here\n\n--  making  misrepresentations  to  an entity  in  order  to\nprocure  payments from  it --  was in  fact criminal  in the\n                                  \nstates  in which the conduct occurred. See, e.g., Mass. Gen.\n                                                \nL.  ch. 266,   30 (larceny and \"false pretenses\"); R.I. Gen.\nLaws    11-41-4  (same); N.H.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch. 637    4\n(1991)  (\"theft by  deception\"); Commonwealth  v. Schoening,\n                                                           \n396 N.E.2d 1004 (Mass.  1979) (prosecution for conspiracy to\ndefraud government official  under false pretenses statute);\nState v. Ricci, 533 A.2d  844 (R.I. 1987) (prosecution under\n              \nfalse pretenses statute of contractor who lied regarding job\nspecifications to obtain payment from city). \n\n          For  this reason, we agree  with the court that it\nneed not consider the need for an \"other law\" requirement in\nSection 371 prosecutions at this time.\n",
