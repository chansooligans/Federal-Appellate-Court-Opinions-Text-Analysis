Plaintiff  Cambridge Plating\n                                  \n\nCompany  filed  this  lawsuit  against  defendant  Napco  seeking\n\ndamages  for  a  defective  wastewater  treatment  system.    The\n\ndistrict court granted summary  judgment for Napco, concluding as\n\na  matter of  law that  the statutes  of limitations  had run  on\n\nplaintiff's claims.  On appeal, Cambridge Plating argues that the\n\ncourt  should have  let the  jury decide  whether Massachusetts's\n\n\"discovery\" rule  suspended the running of  the limitations clock\n\nlong  enough to  preserve  its claims.    Because we  agree  with\n\nplaintiff  that material  issues of fact  remain, we  reverse the\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n                     \n\n     Cambridge   Plating  is  an   electroplating  business  that\n\ndischarges wastewater containing  various metal contaminants into\n\nmunicipal  sewers.   In  an effort  to meet  strict environmental\n\nregulations  governing such discharges,  the company commissioned\n\nthe design and installation of a wastewater treatment system from\n\ndefendant  Napco.  The contract  price for the  system was nearly\n\n$400,000.    Cambridge   Plating  additionally  needed   to  make\n\nsubstantial changes  to its facility to  accommodate the enormous\n\nand  complex  array of  pipes,  tanks,  valves, mixers,  sensors,\n\nrecorders  and other apparatus,  pushing the  total cost  for the\n\nproject to $2.8 million.\n\n     The system began running on October 30, 1984, but it was not\n\nthen  fully operational,  and  Napco continued  installation  and\n\n                               -2-\n\ndebugging for  another year.  In October  1985, Cambridge Plating\n\nbegan to experience unsatisfactory results; testing revealed that\n\ncontaminant  levels   in  the  wastewater   discharges  sometimes\n\nexceeded  regulatory  limits.     Cambridge  Plating's   managers\n\nbelieved the problems stemmed from errors by the system operators\n\nor  errors in  wastewater sampling.   This  belief was  fueled by\n\nNapco representatives who, when contacted by Cambridge Plating on\n\na number of occasions between early 1986 and 1988, suggested ways\n\nthat Cambridge Plating could change  its operation of the system.\n\nNapco refused further visits to Cambridge Plating to service  the\n\nsystem unless it was paid $1,000 per day.\n\n     Cambridge  Plating   took  several  steps   to  resolve  the\n\nperceived  operational or  sampling  problems.   It replaced  the\n\nsystem operators and implemented  the changes suggested by Napco.\n\nIn late  1986, the company  asked a wastewater  treatment expert,\n\nPatrick Hunt, to evaluate the system  and the company's operation\n\nof  it.  Although Hunt found  some minor problems with the system\n\nitself, most of his  recommendations were operational.  Cambridge\n\nPlating  adopted  his  suggestions,  but  the  company  continued\n\nperiodicaly to exceed lawful contaminant levels.\n\n     On  December  29,  1988, the  Massachusetts  Water Resources\n\nAuthority (MWRA), the agency responsible for effluent regulation,\n\nassessed  a   penalty  of  $682,250  on   Cambridge  Plating  for\n\nviolations during  1986-88.  In February  1989, Cambridge Plating\n\ncommissioned  another  expert,  Peter  Moleux,  to  evaluate  the\n\nsystem.   Moleux's  lengthy  inspection, which  included a  close\n\n                               -3-\n\ncomparison  of Napco's  written materials with  the system  as it\n\nactually existed, revealed design flaws, failure to install parts\n\nspecified in the  plans, and  substandard engineering  practices.\n\nMost significantly,  Moleux discovered  that Napco had  failed to\n\ninstall  an important component,  a static  mixer, inside  a pipe\n\nwhere system schematics  provided by Napco  indicated erroneously\n\nthe  device  had  been placed.    Omission  of  the static  mixer\n\nrendered the  system incapable of adequately  cleaning 80 percent\n\nof the wastewater.\n\n     After  Moleux's  evaluation, Cambridge  Plating  installed a\n\nstatic  mixer  at the  point called  for by  Napco's plans.   The\n\nsystem  thereafter worked  properly,  enabling Cambridge  Plating\n\nconsistently to comply with the effluent limitations.\n\n     B. Procedural Background\n                             \n\n     Cambridge Plating  filed this action in  June 1990, alleging\n\ncauses  of  action for  breach  of  contract, negligence,  fraud,\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation, and violation  of the Massachusetts\n\nunfair  business practices  act, Mass.  Gen. Laws  Ann. ch.  93A.\n\nNapco moved  for summary judgment, arguing that  all of Cambridge\n\nPlating's  claims  were  barred  by the  applicable  statutes  of\n\nlimitation.  The district court agreed with Napco.\n\n     The court concluded that Cambridge Plating's purchase of the\n\nwastewater treatment system  was a  sale of goods,  and that  its\n\ncontract  claim thus  was governed  by the  four-year limitations\n\nperiod under the  Uniform Commercial Code,  Mass. Gen. Laws  Ann.\n\nch. 106,   2-725, rather than by the general six-year contractual\n\n                               -4-\n\nlimitations period,  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.  ch. 260,   2.   All of\n\nCambridge Plating's causes of  action, therefore, were subject to\n\neither  three-  or  four-year  statutes of  limitation.1    These\n\nclaims  were  time-barred,  the  court  determined, because  they\n\naccrued in late 1985,  some four and one-half years  before suit,\n\nwhen the company  learned that  the system was  failing to  bring\n\neffluent  discharges within  legal  limits.   The court  rejected\n\nplaintiff's  argument that  the limitations  periods were  tolled\n\nuntil Moleux's  evaluation, when Cambridge Plating  first learned\n\nthe  cause of the system's  problems.  The  court concluded that,\n\nwith  reasonable   diligence,   Cambridge  Plating   could   have\n\ndiscovered the defects once the system started malfunctioning.\n\n     On   appeal,  Cambridge   Plating  argues  that   the  court\n\nmisconstrued the contract and the discovery rule, which serves to\n\ntoll certain  hard-to-discern claims, and improperly  usurped the\n\njury's role when it decided as a matter of law that  the rule did\n\nnot  preserve the company's claims.   Our review  of the district\n\ncourt's grant of  summary judgment  is plenary, and  we read  the\n\nrecord in the light most amicable to the party contesting summary\n\njudgment.  See,  e.g., Pagano v.  Frank, 983 F.2d  343, 347  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1993).\n\n                               II.\n\n                    \n\n     1  Tort  actions are  subject  to  a three-year  limitations\nperiod, Mass.  Gen. Laws  Ann.  ch. 260,    2A,  and a  four-year\nstatute  applies to  consumer  protection actions  brought  under\nChapter 93A, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 260,   5A.\n\n                               -5-\n\n     Cambridge Plating contends that  the district court erred in\n\nruling as a matter of law that the contract with Napco was a sale\n\nof  goods contract  within  the  scope  of  the  UCC.    Although\n\ndetermining the type of contract at issue typically may be a jury\n\nfunction, see United States v. City  of Twin Falls, 806 F.2d 862,\n                                                  \n\n870 (9th Cir. 1986),  we believe the facts here  are sufficiently\n\nclear and undisputed  that the  district court  was permitted  to\n\nmake its finding as a matter of law.  Id.\n                                         \n\n     Cambridge  Plating  asserts  that the  UCC  is  inapplicable\n\nbecause  the  equipment it  purchased  does not  meet  the Code's\n\ndefinition of goods.  Under the UCC,  \"goods\" are defined as \"all\n\nthings . .  . which are movable at the  time of identification to\n\nthe contract for sale . . . .\"  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 106,\n                                   \n\n   2-105.   The  company  emphasizes  the  immense  size  of  the\n\nwastewater  treatment   system  and  its  integration   into  the\n\nelectroplating  facility in  an effort  to equate  this situation\n\nwith White v. Peabody  Construction Co., 386 Mass. 121,  132, 434\n                                       \n\nN.E.2d 1015 (1982), where the  court ruled that the UCC  does not\n\napply to \"the sale of structures attached to realty.\"\n\n     But this comparison  is flawed.   The claims  in White  were\n                                                           \n\nbased on contracts calling for \"[t]he erection of  buildings\" and\n\nfor the sale  of a completed building  -- \"not contracts for  the\n\nsale of bricks or  window frames or  caulking material.\"  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n131, 133.  In this case, the proposal specified the components of\n\nthe  system as  the  primary subject  of  the sale  and,  indeed,\n\nspecifically described the contract as one \"for goods.\"  See App.\n                                                            \n\n                               -6-\n\nat  113.  The proposal separately listed eighty-eight items to be\n\nprovided  by  Napco,  eighty-two  of  which  involved  pieces  of\n\nequipment.   At the time of identification to the contract, these\n\nwere movable and  therefore goods  within the scope  of the  UCC.\n\nAccord Twin  Falls,  806 F.2d  at 871  (components of  wastewater\n                  \n\ntreatment  system   are  movable  goods).    It  was  only  after\n\ninstallation  into  plaintiff's  building that  the  items became\n\nmerged with the  facility and  hence unmovable --  to borrow  the\n\ndistrict  court's analogy, like cans  of paint sold  as goods and\n\nthen applied to a wall.2\n\n     That the  contract involved the purchase  of engineering and\n\ninstallation services, in  addition to a sale of  goods, is of no\n\nconsequence.   In our view,  Massachusetts law is consistent with\n\nthe general trend to view such mixed contracts as governed by the\n\nUCC.  See Twin  Falls, 806 F.2d at 871.   In White, 386  Mass. at\n                                                  \n\n131-32, the Supreme Judicial  Court ruled that \"[c]ontracts whose\n\npredominant  factor,  thrust,  or  purpose is  the  rendition  of\n\nservices\"  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  UCC.    It  follows\n\ninexorably that, if  the \"rendition  of services\" is  not at  the\n\nheart of a mixed contract, the UCC does govern.  See USM Corp. v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     2 Plaintiff also  cites in support of its  position Chestnut\n                                                                 \nHill  Dev. Corp. v. Otis Elevator Co.,  653 F. Supp. 927, 932 (D.\n                                     \nMass.  1987), which  held that  structures \"attached  to realty,\"\nsuch  as  the elevator  system at  issue  there, are  not \"goods\"\nwithin  the meaning  of the  UCC.   Under  the UCC,  however, the\ninquiry  centers  on the  nature of  the  goods \"at  the  time of\nidentification  to the contract,\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 106,  \n2-105.  It is beyond debate that the contract here listed movable\nitems.  See  Burnham v. Mark IV Homes, Inc.,  387 Mass. 575, 581,\n                                           \n441 N.E.2d 1027 (1982) (modular homes are \"goods\" within coverage\nof UCC).\n\n                               -7-\n\nArthur  D.  Little Systems,  Inc., 28  Mass.  App. 108,  119, 546\n                                 \n\nN.E.2d 888  (1989) (contract  for computer system  involving both\n\nsale of goods and delivery of services governed by UCC).\n\n     The  undisputed  facts  demonstrate  that  the deal  between\n\nCambridge  Plating and Napco was  first, and foremost,  a sale of\n\ngoods.    Most of  the purchase  price  was for  the specifically\n\nlisted  items of equipment.   Only $68,970 of  the total contract\n\nprice  of   $398,200  was   for  installation,3   and  purchasing\n\ninstallation  from  Napco  was  even  optional.    See  generally\n                                                                 \n\nChestnut Hill Dev.  Corp. v. Otis Elevator Co., 653 F.

Mass.   1987)  (a  contract  to   supply  \"hundreds  of\n\ncomponents\"  is not \"one whose primary thrust is the rendition of\n\nservices\").  Because  the contract was so heavily weighted toward\n\ngoods, it must fall within the scope of the UCC.\n\n     The district court correctly  applied the UCC to plaintiff's\n\ncontract claim.   We thus  move on  to consider whether  this and\n\nCambridge Plating's other claims were timely brought.\n\n                               III.\n\n     Although  the  Massachusetts legislature  has  set statutory\n\nlimitations periods for various causes of action, see supra at 4-\n                                                           \n\n5  &amp;  n.1, determining  when claims  accrue  \"`has long  been the\n\nproduct  of judicial  interpretation,'\"  Hoult v.

Caselaw establishes that\n\nthe  general  rule for  negligence claims  is  that the  cause of\n\naction  accrues at the  time of injury.   Riley  v.

Similarly, a cause  of\n\naction for breach of contract usually  accrues at the time of the\n\nbreach,  International Mobiles Corp. v. Corroon &amp; Black/Fairfield\n                                                                 \n\n&amp; Ellis, Inc., 29 Mass.

App. at 220-21.\n\n     These designated  times  are subject  to  some  flexibility,\n\nhowever,  because Massachusetts  courts  have recognized  that it\n\nwould  be  unfair to  begin  running the  statute  of limitations\n\nbefore a plaintiff is  put on notice that  she has a claim.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBowen v.

Sears,  365  Mass. 83,  83-84,  310 N.E.2d  131 (1974).    The\n        \n\ndelayed  knowledge may be either the fact of injury, such as when\n\n                               -9-\n\nan item is not used and thus not discovered to be defective for a\n\nsubstantial time  after its  purchase, see, e.g.,  Anthony's Pier\n                                                                 \n\nFour, Inc., 396 Mass. at 825-26,4  or the cause of the harm, such\n          \n\nas when an individual  with a physical illness does  not discover\n\nthe illness's  link to  particular medical treatment  until years\n\nafter becoming sick, see, e.g., Bowen, 408 Mass. at 207.5\n                                     \n\n     Not all  contractual causes  of action in  Massachusetts are\n\ngoverned  by  the  judicially  crafted  accrual  rules.    Claims\n\nalleging breach  of a contract for the  sale of goods instead are\n\nsubject to the detailed provisions of the UCC.  Under   2-275(2),\n\na  cause of  action  for breach  of  a sales  contract  generally\n\naccrues  when the  breach  occurs, \"regardless  of the  aggrieved\n\nparty's  lack  of  knowledge of  the  breach,\"  and  a breach  of\n\nwarranty occurs when tender of delivery is made.  Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn.  ch. 106,     2-275(2).   When  a seller  gives  an explicit\n\nwarranty of future performance, however,\n\n                    \n\n     4  Anthony's  Pier Four  involved  an action  filed  in 1980\n                            \nagainst  the designers  of a  ship mooring  system that  had been\ncompleted in 1968.  The plaintiff claimed that it was  unaware of\nthe system's design deficiencies  until it actually failed during\na storm  in 1978.   The  court held that  the lawsuit  was timely\nbecause  \"[t]he plaintiff  discovered  the breach  when the  boat\ncapsized in 1978  and there  is no  showing that  it should  have\nknown of the breach earlier.\" 396 Mass. at 826.\n\n     5 The plaintiff  in Bowen had  suffered a malignant  vaginal\n                              \ntumor requiring surgery in 1969 but did not file suit blaming the\ncancer on a prescription drug manufactured by defendant Eli Lilly\n&amp;  Co. until 1983.   The  court applied  the discovery  rule, but\nnevertheless determined that the plaintiff was on notice that the\ndefendant may have caused  her harm more than three  years before\nfiling her action.  408 Mass. at 210. \n\n                               -10-\n\n     and discovery of the breach must await the time of such\n     performance the cause of action accrues when the breach\n     is or should have been discovered.\n\nId.  Thus, like the tort and contract causes of action subject to\n   \n\nthe  judicial discovery rule, a  cause of action  for breach of a\n\nwarranty of future performance is tolled until  the plaintiff has\n\nadequate notice of the claim.\n\n     The district court found that the  transaction at issue here\n\nwas  a sale  of goods,  and that  the UCC  therefore governs  the\n\ncontract claim.   It further determined that  Napco expressly had\n\nwarranted  the  future performance  of  the  wastewater treatment\n\nsystem, and that, consequently, the statutory discovery provision\n\napplies.   Because  we  have concluded  that  the district  court\n\ncorrectly ruled as a  matter of law that the parties entered into\n\na sale  of goods, and there  is no challenge to  its finding that\n\nNapco  gave  an  explicit  warranty of  future  performance,  the\n\ntimeliness  of  all  of  plaintiff's  claims  is  linked  to  the\n\ndiscovery rule.    \n\n                               IV.\n\n     Our  analysis of  the discovery rule's  impact in  this case\n\nmust  begin with the parties'  conflicting views on  how the rule\n\noperates.   Defendant Napco asserts that the rule applies only to\n\n\"inherently unknowable\"  causes of  action and that  the question\n\nbefore us is whether Cambridge Plating's claims were discoverable\n\nthrough  reasonably  diligent  efforts.6   If  Cambridge  Plating\n\n                    \n\n     6  Although  the  dictionary  definition  suggests  that  an\n\"inherently\" unknowable  claim is  one that would  be permanently\n                                                                 \nundiscoverable, see  The Random  House Dictionary of  the English\n                                                                 \n\n                               -11-\n\ncould  have  discovered  its claims  earlier  through  reasonable\n     \n\ndiligence,  Napco  maintains,  then   they  were  not  inherently\n                                                                 \n\nunknowable and the discovery rule would not apply.\n\n     Cambridge Plating  counters  that the  applicability of  the\n\ndiscovery rule does not depend on whether it was possible for the\n\ncompany  to  discover  Napco's  responsibility  for  the  defects\n\nearlier  by pursuing some other reasonable course of action.  The\n\ninquiry, it asserts, must focus on the reasonableness of what the\n\ncompany actually did.  If the company acted diligently, but still\n\nreasonably  failed to learn of its cause of action, the discovery\n\nrule would continue to delay the limitations clock.\n\n     The  district  court  adopted  Napco's  view,  finding  that\n\nCambridge Plating could have discovered the system's defects once\n\nthe  company  learned  that  the water  treatment  equipment  was\n\nfailing to  bring effluent discharges  within legal limits.   The\n\ncourt pointed to expert Moleux's affidavit  as evidence that \"the\n\ndefects were manifestly knowable to someone with an appropriately\n                                \n\ntrained eye,\" Opinion at 10  (emphasis in original).  It  did not\n\nmatter, the court ruled,  whether Cambridge Plating had exercised\n\nreasonable  diligence in  hiring the  first expert,  who did  not\n\ndiscover  the   defects:  \"[w]hether   a  defect  is   inherently\n\nunknowable turns  not upon  an inquiry  into whether the  injured\n\n                    \n\nLanguage (2d  ed. 1987)  at  982, the  phrase  has been  used  to\n        \ndescribe  a cause of action  that was incapable  of detection for\nsome  prolonged  period  of  time   even  with  the  exercise  of\nreasonable diligence.  See,  e.g., Tagliente v. Himmer,  949 F.2d\n                                                      \n1,  5 (1st  Cir. 1991);  White v.

The rule is designed  to protect plaintiffs,\n\nto assure that \"`a plaintiff [] be put on notice before his claim\n\nis barred,'\" Anthony's Pier Four, Inc., 396 Mass. at 824 (quoting\n                                      \n\nFranklin, 381 Mass. at 619).  This protection would be frustrated\n        \n\nif  a  plaintiff who  remained unaware  of  his claim  even after\n\nconducting reasonable inquiry was  time-barred from pursuing  it.\n\nFairness  dictates   that  the  discovery  rule   not  be  deemed\n\ninapplicable simply  because reasonable actions other  than those\n\ntaken by the plaintiff  could have uncovered the injury  or cause\n                             \n\nof harm.  See  generally Franklin, 381 Mass. at  618 (limitations\n                                 \n\nstatutes are intended, inter alia, to \"`stimulate [plaintiffs] to\n                                 \n\nactivity'\" and  \"punish[]  negligent  delay\")  (quoting  Wood  v.\n                                                             \n\nCarpenter, 101 U.S. 135, 139 (1879)).\n         \n\n     Indeed, the contrary conclusion would require something more\n\nthan  reasonableness  on the  part  of  the plaintiff;  Cambridge\n\nPlating complains  that nothing  less than omniscience  would do.\n\nWhenever more than  one reasonable  option for  pursuing a  claim\n\nexisted -- when, for example, two or three qualified experts were\n\n                               -13-\n\navailable to  investigate a non-performing piece  of equipment --\n\nthe  plaintiff would  be  penalized if  the  first expert  chosen\n\nreasonably failed to discover a problem the second expert managed\n\nto  detect.  That the  plaintiff had been  diligent in hiring the\n\nfirst expert would be  irrelevant, even though the very  point of\n\nthe rule was to protect plaintiffs whose reasonable efforts would\n\nfail  to put  them on notice  of their claims.   This, certainly,\n\ncannot be the intent of the Massachusetts courts.\n\n     The   formulation  that   we  believe   reflects  prevailing\n\nMassachusetts law was particularly well articulated in Bowen, one\n                                                            \n\nof the Supreme Judicial Court's more recent discovery rule cases:\n\n     This  rule  prescribes  as  crucial  the  date  when  a\n     plaintiff  discovers,  or  any earlier  date  when  she\n     should  reasonably have  discovered, that she  has been\n     harmed  or  may have  been  harmed  by the  defendant's\n     conduct.\n     . . .\n     [T]he  statute of  limitations  starts to  run when  an\n     event  or events  have  occurred that  were  reasonably\n     likely to put the plaintiff on  notice that someone may\n     have caused her injury.\n\n408  Mass. at 205-206, 207.  See  also, e.g., Riley, 409 Mass. at\n                                                   \n\n243; Franklin, 381 Mass. at  619.  Bowen makes it clear  that the\n                                        \n\nsteps taken by a plaintiff to discover her cause of action play a\n\nrole  in the decision whether  to apply the  discovery rule: \"the\n\ndecision  whether  any  [injury]  should  reasonably   have  been\n\nuncovered  ha[s] to be made  in light of  what reasonable inquiry\n\nwould have disclosed.\"  Id. at 206 (citing Friedman, 371 Mass. at\n                                                   \n\n485-86).  Accrual of  the plaintiff's cause of action  is tested,\n\ntherefore, \"by  what a reasonable  person in  her position  would\n\n                               -14-\n\nhave known or  on inquiry  would have discovered  at the  various\n\nrelevant times,\" Bowen, 408 Mass. at 210.\n                      \n\n     Thus, if Cambridge Plating acted  reasonably diligently when\n\nit  hired the first expert,  the fact that  that expert failed to\n\ndiscover the  system's  defects must  be sufficient  to toll  the\n\nstatute  of limitations.7    This is  so  because, if  reasonable\n\ninquiry  failed to disclose the  problem, it cannot  be said that\n\nthe problem  \"should reasonably have been  uncovered,\" Bowen, 408\n                                                            \n\nMass. at 206.8\n\n     We recognize that the district  court's interpretation finds\n\nliteral  support  in the  language of  a  number of  cases, which\n\ndescribe  the discovery  rule as  applicable only  to \"inherently\n\nunknowable\"  claims or refer to the time when a plaintiff \"could\"\n\nhave known of his claim.   See, e.g., Melrose Hous. Auth.  v. New\n                                                                 \n\nHampshire  Ins.

If\nMoleux's  exhaustive study of the  system would have  met but not\nsurpassed the  threshold standard of reasonableness  even if done\ntwo years  earlier, then  Hunt's apparently less  thorough review\nwould not have been sufficient inquiry under  the discovery rule.\nOn  the other  hand,  if Cambridge  Plating exercised  reasonable\ndiligence in hiring Hunt, and his performance was competent, then\nMoleux's efforts beyond the  reasonableness threshold should  not\nfurnish a basis for  denying discovery rule protection.   On this\nrecord, we do not  think that the district court  could determine\nas a matter  of law  that the first  evaluation was  incompetent.\nSee Section V infra.     \n                   \n\n                               -15-\n\n222; Melrose Hous.

When  a plaintiff has\n\nmade no reasonable  efforts to  discover the harm  or its  cause,\n\nconsidering whether a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered\n                                                 \n\nhis  claim will produce the same result as considering whether he\n\nreasonably could have  discovered it.   For example,  if a  court\n                \n\nfound that  a claim  could not  be discovered  through reasonable\n                              \n\ndiligence,  it  would be  precluding as  well  a finding  that he\n\nreasonably  should have  discovered it.   See,  e.g.,  White, 386\n                                                            \n\nMass.  at 130  (in cases  cited, \"the  nature of  the defendant's\n\nwrong was such that  the plaintiff did not discover and could not\n\nreasonably  have discovered that he or she had been injured until\n\n[a later time]\").\n\n                               -16-\n\n     Similarly,  a court  might find that,  if the  plaintiff had\n\nbeen  diligent, she could have  discovered her claim.   From this\n                         \n\nconclusion, lacking  contrary information, it also  is logical to\n\npresume  that the  plaintiff  should have  discovered her  claim.\n                                    \n\nHaving  failed to act, the  plaintiff has no  basis for disputing\n\nthe  court's sensible  presumption that reasonable  actions would\n\nhave produced results.   See,  e.g., Friedman  v. Jablonski,  371\n                                                           \n\nMass. 482, 486, 358 N.E.2d 994  (1976); Melrose, 24 Mass.

Because none\n\nof  the cases  cited to  us present  that situation,  and because\n\nconstruing the rule as the district court applied it  effectively\n\nwould  take away the protection the discovery rule is designed to\n\nprovide, we  are confident that  Cambridge Plating's view  of the\n\ndiscovery rule is correct.\n\n     We think it worth emphasizing  that, so construed, the  rule\n\ndoes   not  permit  a  plaintiff  to  buy  time  by  engaging  an\n\nincompetent \"expert.\"  Hiring an individual  who is poorly suited\n\nto  investigate the type of  injury suffered by  the plaintiff is\n\n                               -17-\n\nunlikely to be deemed  \"reasonable\" inquiry sufficient to suspend\n\nthe  limitations  period.     Moreover,  even  if  the  plaintiff\n\nreasonably hires a professional he believes to be  competent, but\n\nwho fails to  discover a  defect that a  qualified expert  easily\n\nshould  have found, the plaintiff's only recourse is likely to be\n\nagainst the deficient professional.  The discovery rule would not\n\nsave the overlooked claim  because reasonable inquiry should have\n                                                            \n\nput the  plaintiff on notice of  it.  See Friedman,  371 Mass. at\n                                                  \n\n486 &amp; n.4  (a competent lawyer  would have done title  search and\n\nshould have discovered defect). \n\n     The discovery rule's protection is limited in another way as\n\nwell.  The  rule does not suspend the  running of the limitations\n\nperiod  pending confirmation  of  the plaintiff's  injury or  its\n\ncause, but simply  stops the  clock until the  occurrence of  \"an\n\nevent or  events .  . .  that were reasonably  likely to  put the\n\nplaintiff on notice  that someone  may have  caused her  injury,\"\n                                      \n\nBowen, 408 Mass. at 207 (emphasis added).  Thus,  a plaintiff who\n     \n\nin the 1970s was told that her injury may have been caused by her\n\nmother's ingestion of DES was unable to invoke the discovery rule\n\nto save  the lawsuit she filed a decade later, when she felt more\n\ncertain of the causal connection.  See id. at 209-10.\n                                          \n\n     Applying  these principles  to the  case at  hand, Cambridge\n\nPlating's  ability to invoke the  discovery rule --  and thus the\n\ntimeliness of its claims -- turns on when the company should have\n\nknown that Napco  might be  responsible for  the water  treatment\n\nsystem's failing  performance.   In  Section  V, we  discuss  our\n\n                               -18-\n\nconclusion  that this question must  be answered by  the trier of\n\nfact.    See  Riley, 409  Mass.  at  247-48  (jury should  decide\n                   \n\ndisputed issues relating to statute of limitations).\n\n                                V.\n\n     To survive Napco's motion for summary judgment  based on the\n\nstatute  of limitations,  Cambridge Plating  must show  a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether it knew or should have known\n\nof  its claims  before June  22, 1987.9   See  Fidler v.  Eastman\n                                                                 \n\nKodak Co., 714  F.2d 192, 197-98  (1st Cir. 1983); Hoult,  792 F.\n                                                        \n\nSupp. at 145; Riley, 409 Mass. at 244, 247.  No one suggests that\n                   \n\nCambridge  Plating  in  fact  knew the  source  of  the  system's\n\nproblems before  early 1989, and  the issue therefore  is whether\n\nthere is a factual  dispute over whether the company  should have\n\nrealized Napco's possible responsibility before that date.\n\n     A  careful analysis of the  record persuades us  that such a\n\ndispute  exists.  In finding that Cambridge Plating was on notice\n\nof its claims in late 1985, the district court  relied heavily on\n\nthe company's having  learned at  that time that  the system  was\n\nfailing to  bring effluent discharges down  to acceptable levels.\n\nThe  court  felt  that   Cambridge  Plating's  knowledge  of  the\n\ndeficiencies meant that it knew that the performance warranty was\n\nbeing breached.  Additionally,  consistent with its understanding\n\n                    \n\n     9  The lawsuit was filed on June  22, 1990.  As discussed in\nSection III,  supra, certain of the claims have four-year, rather\n                   \nthan three-year,  statutes of limitation, and  those claims would\nbe  timely even  if  Cambridge Plating  learned  of them  a  year\nearlier, in  1986.  For the sake  of simplicity, because it makes\nno  difference in  the result,  we discuss the  claims as  if all\nneeded to be filed within three years of their discovery. \n\n                               -19-\n\nof the discovery rule, see Section IV supra, the court ruled that\n                                           \n\nCambridge Plating was then on notice of the other claims as well.\n\n     The system's inadequate performance  in late 1985 strikes us\n\nas  far less portentous.  Beyond doubt, when the system first was\n\ninstalled,  and throughout  Napco's debugging  process, Cambridge\n\nPlating had no reason to suspect the serious flaws.   Omission of\n\nthe  static  mixer  was virtually  impossible  for  anyone but  a\n\nwastewater treatment expert to  discover, both because the device\n\nwas  supposed to  be located  inside a  pipe and  because Napco's\n                                    \n\ndiagrams  indicated that  it had been  installed.   Moreover, any\n\ndeficiencies presumably  were to be resolved  once Napco finished\n\nits finetuning.\n\n     When  the  problems persisted  despite  Napco's announcement\n\nthat debugging  was complete, two explanations theoretically were\n\navailable.  Either  the system  itself was defective,  or it  was\n\nbeing  operated  improperly.   At  this point,  however,  the two\n\npossibilities were not equally  weighted.  Cambridge Plating knew\n\nthat the  system was  technically complex and  required sensitive\n\noperation.   And  Napco's  only response  to Cambridge  Plating's\n\ninquiries was to suggest ways to improve operation.\n\n     In these circumstances, we  do not believe Massachusetts law\n\nrequires  a finding that Cambridge  Plating was on  notice of the\n\nsystem's defects.  A plaintiff is sufficiently aware of her cause\n\nof  action,  and thus  should have  discovered  it, once  she has\n\nreceived  \"notice  of  likely cause,\"  Fidler,  714  F.2d at  199\n                                             \n\n(quoted  in  Bowen, 408  Mass. at  207-08).   Accordingly,  as we\n                  \n\n                               -20-\n\nunderstand the requisite notice,  the statute of limitations will\n\nbegin  to run once the plaintiff has enough information to target\n\nthe defendant  as a suspect,  though not necessarily  to identify\n\nthe  defendant as the culprit.   See Bowen,  408 Mass. at 207-08.\n                                          \n\nWe think it within  a factfinder's province to conclude  that, in\n\nlate 1985,  Cambridge Plating had no basis for suspecting Napco's\n\nworkmanship  and  reasonably  attributed  the  system's  problems\n\nsolely to  its own deficient  operation.   If so, the  statute of\n\nlimitations would not yet have begun to run.10\n\n     Cambridge  Plating  hired new  operators,  but  the problems\n\npersisted.    So, in  late 1986,  the  company engaged  its first\n\nexpert evaluation of  the system.   This, too,  resulted in  only\n\noperational suggestions.  Should  this expert have discovered the\n\ndefects?   Again, we believe this is a question properly answered\n\nby the trier  of fact.   The record  contains little  information\n\nabout  the  first expert,  describing  him only  as  an assistant\n\ninstructor  for  a wastewater  treatment  course  at a  community\n\ncollege who \"worked on waste treatment for Hewlett Packard.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nAffidavit of Edward Marullo, at 2.   Was he competent to evaluate\n\nthe  system?  Would even a well qualified expert necessarily have\n\nuncovered the problem based on what  he knew about the system  at\n\n                    \n\n     10  The facts here contrast  with those in  White v. Peabody\n                                                                 \nConstruction Co.,  386 Mass. 121 (1982),  where plaintiffs sought\n                \nto  recover damages  resulting  from widespread  window and  roof\nleaks  allegedly  caused  by  defendants'   improper  design  and\nconstruction  of   a  housing   project.    The   court  rejected\napplication of  the discovery  rule there because  the plaintiffs\n\"reasonably should  have known that  widespread water leaks  in a\nnewly  constructed building  are almost  certainly the  result of\ndesign or construction defects.\"  Id. at 130.\n                                     \n\n                               -21-\n\nthat point?  Was it reasonable to rely on the schematics provided\n\nby Napco showing that a static mixer had been installed?  Perhaps\n\nthe  second expert discovered the defects  only because, in light\n\nof the earlier  expert's reasonable work, a more exhaustive study\n\nnow appeared necessary.11\n\n     Because   the   record   leaves  these   subsidiary   issues\n\nunresolved,  factual  questions  remain as  to  whether Cambridge\n\nPlating should  have known  even by  the end  of 1986  of Napco's\n\npossible  responsibility  for  the  system's failings.    If  the\n\nexpert's failure  to discover the defects was  reasonable, a jury\n\ncould find that Cambridge Plating continued to deserve protection\n\nfrom the discovery rule beyond that time.12\n\n     Whether  the rule's  impact, assuming  it reached  this far,\n\ncontinued  on  through the  time of  actual  discovery is  also a\n\nmatter  for jury deliberation.  Was it reasonable for the company\n\nto  wait another two years before seeking additional advice?  Was\n\nthere a point in  time after Cambridge Plating had  complied with\n\nall of the  first expert's suggestions, still  without any change\n\nin the  system's performance, that the  company reasonably should\n\nhave realized that Napco's work may have been to blame?\n\n                    \n\n     11 An affidavit from the second expert, Peter Moleux, states\nthat, in his opinion, \"the defects in the system  could have been\ndiscovered  only by someone  with expertise  and training  in the\nfield  similar  to mine  and only  after  a lengthy  and thorough\ninspection and analysis.\"  See App. at 179   33.  Moleux reported\n                              \nthat he spent \"many days\" identifying the system's problems. \n\n     12  Of  course,  claims  subject  to  four-year  limitations\nperiods  would be timely even  if the discovery  rule only tolled\nthe running of the clock through the end of 1986.\n\n                               -22-\n\n     In  short,  many  questions   remain.    To  determine  when\n\nCambridge  Plating \"reasonably  should have  discovered\" that  it\n\nmight have  claims against Napco  requires a  review of  specific\n\ncircumstances  about which the  record presently contains sketchy\n\ninformation.  Consequently, the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment must be set aside.13\n\n     Reversed and remanded. No costs.\n                                    \n\n                    \n\n     13  We  are unpersuaded  by Cambridge  Plating's alternative\ntheories  that  the  statutes   were  tolled  because  (1)  Napco\nconcealed  omission of  the  static mixer  and  (2) Napco  had  a\nfiduciary duty to disclose the omission but failed to do so.

The\n\ndistrict court granted summary  judgment for Napco, concluding as\n\na  matter of  law that  the statutes  of limitations  had run  on\n\nplaintiff's claims.  On appeal, Cambridge Plating argues that the\n\ncourt  should have  let the  jury decide  whether Massachusetts's\n\n\"discovery\" rule  suspended the running of  the limitations clock\n\nlong  enough to  preserve  its claims.    Because we  agree  with\n\nplaintiff  that material  issues of fact  remain, we  reverse the\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n                     \n\n     Cambridge   Plating  is  an   electroplating  business  that\n\ndischarges wastewater containing  various metal contaminants into\n\nmunicipal  sewers.   In  an effort  to meet  strict environmental\n\nregulations  governing such discharges,  the company commissioned\n\nthe design and installation of a wastewater treatment system from\n\ndefendant  Napco.  The contract  price for the  system was nearly\n\n$400,000.    Cambridge   Plating  additionally  needed   to  make\n\nsubstantial changes  to its facility to  accommodate the enormous\n\nand  complex  array of  pipes,  tanks,  valves, mixers,  sensors,\n\nrecorders  and other apparatus,  pushing the  total cost  for the\n\nproject to $2.8 million.\n\n     The system began running on October 30, 1984, but it was not\n\nthen  fully operational,  and  Napco continued  installation  and\n\n                               -2-\n\ndebugging for  another year.  In October  1985, Cambridge Plating\n\nbegan to experience unsatisfactory results; testing revealed that\n\ncontaminant  levels   in  the  wastewater   discharges  sometimes\n\nexceeded  regulatory  limits.     Cambridge  Plating's   managers\n\nbelieved the problems stemmed from errors by the system operators\n\nor  errors in  wastewater sampling.   This  belief was  fueled by\n\nNapco representatives who, when contacted by Cambridge Plating on\n\na number of occasions between early 1986 and 1988, suggested ways\n\nthat Cambridge Plating could change  its operation of the system.\n\nNapco refused further visits to Cambridge Plating to service  the\n\nsystem unless it was paid $1,000 per day.\n\n     Cambridge  Plating   took  several  steps   to  resolve  the\n\nperceived  operational or  sampling  problems.   It replaced  the\n\nsystem operators and implemented  the changes suggested by Napco.\n\nIn late  1986, the company  asked a wastewater  treatment expert,\n\nPatrick Hunt, to evaluate the system  and the company's operation\n\nof  it.  Although Hunt found  some minor problems with the system\n\nitself, most of his  recommendations were operational.  Cambridge\n\nPlating  adopted  his  suggestions,  but  the  company  continued\n\nperiodicaly to exceed lawful contaminant levels.\n\n     On  December  29,  1988, the  Massachusetts  Water Resources\n\nAuthority (MWRA), the agency responsible for effluent regulation,\n\nassessed  a   penalty  of  $682,250  on   Cambridge  Plating  for\n\nviolations during  1986-88.  In February  1989, Cambridge Plating\n\ncommissioned  another  expert,  Peter  Moleux,  to  evaluate  the\n\nsystem.   Moleux's  lengthy  inspection, which  included a  close\n\n                               -3-\n\ncomparison  of Napco's  written materials with  the system  as it\n\nactually existed, revealed design flaws, failure to install parts\n\nspecified in the  plans, and  substandard engineering  practices.\n\nMost significantly,  Moleux discovered  that Napco had  failed to\n\ninstall  an important component,  a static  mixer, inside  a pipe\n\nwhere system schematics  provided by Napco  indicated erroneously\n\nthe  device  had  been placed.    Omission  of  the static  mixer\n\nrendered the  system incapable of adequately  cleaning 80 percent\n\nof the wastewater.\n\n     After  Moleux's  evaluation, Cambridge  Plating  installed a\n\nstatic  mixer  at the  point called  for by  Napco's plans.   The\n\nsystem  thereafter worked  properly,  enabling Cambridge  Plating\n\nconsistently to comply with the effluent limitations.\n\n     B. Procedural Background\n                             \n\n     Cambridge Plating  filed this action in  June 1990, alleging\n\ncauses  of  action for  breach  of  contract, negligence,  fraud,\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation, and violation  of the Massachusetts\n\nunfair  business practices  act, Mass.  Gen. Laws  Ann. ch.  93A.\n\nNapco moved  for summary judgment, arguing that  all of Cambridge\n\nPlating's  claims  were  barred  by the  applicable  statutes  of\n\nlimitation.  The district court agreed with Napco.\n\n     The court concluded that Cambridge Plating's purchase of the\n\nwastewater treatment system  was a  sale of goods,  and that  its\n\ncontract  claim thus  was governed  by the  four-year limitations\n\nperiod under the  Uniform Commercial Code,  Mass. Gen. Laws  Ann.\n\nch. 106,   2-725, rather than by the general six-year contractual\n\n                               -4-\n\nlimitations period,  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.  ch. 260,   2.   All of\n\nCambridge Plating's causes of  action, therefore, were subject to\n\neither  three-  or  four-year  statutes of  limitation.1    These\n\nclaims  were  time-barred,  the  court  determined, because  they\n\naccrued in late 1985,  some four and one-half years  before suit,\n\nwhen the company  learned that  the system was  failing to  bring\n\neffluent  discharges within  legal  limits.   The court  rejected\n\nplaintiff's  argument that  the limitations  periods were  tolled\n\nuntil Moleux's  evaluation, when Cambridge Plating  first learned\n\nthe  cause of the system's  problems.  The  court concluded that,\n\nwith  reasonable   diligence,   Cambridge  Plating   could   have\n\ndiscovered the defects once the system started malfunctioning.\n\n     On   appeal,  Cambridge   Plating  argues  that   the  court\n\nmisconstrued the contract and the discovery rule, which serves to\n\ntoll certain  hard-to-discern claims, and improperly  usurped the\n\njury's role when it decided as a matter of law that  the rule did\n\nnot  preserve the company's claims.   Our review  of the district\n\ncourt's grant of  summary judgment  is plenary, and  we read  the\n\nrecord in the light most amicable to the party contesting summary\n\njudgment.

Under   2-275(2),\n\na  cause of  action  for breach  of  a sales  contract  generally\n\naccrues  when the  breach  occurs, \"regardless  of the  aggrieved\n\nparty's  lack  of  knowledge of  the  breach,\"  and  a breach  of\n\nwarranty occurs when tender of delivery is made.  Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn.  ch. 106,     2-275(2).   When  a seller  gives  an explicit\n\nwarranty of future performance, however,\n\n                    \n\n     4  Anthony's  Pier Four  involved  an action  filed  in 1980\n                            \nagainst  the designers  of a  ship mooring  system that  had been\ncompleted in 1968.  The plaintiff claimed that it was  unaware of\nthe system's design deficiencies  until it actually failed during\na storm  in 1978.   The  court held that  the lawsuit  was timely\nbecause  \"[t]he plaintiff  discovered  the breach  when the  boat\ncapsized in 1978  and there  is no  showing that  it should  have\nknown of the breach earlier.\" 396 Mass. at 826.\n\n     5 The plaintiff  in Bowen had  suffered a malignant  vaginal\n                              \ntumor requiring surgery in 1969 but did not file suit blaming the\ncancer on a prescription drug manufactured by defendant Eli Lilly\n&amp;  Co. until 1983.   The  court applied  the discovery  rule, but\nnevertheless determined that the plaintiff was on notice that the\ndefendant may have caused  her harm more than three  years before\nfiling her action.  408 Mass. at 210. \n\n                               -10-\n\n     and discovery of the breach must await the time of such\n     performance the cause of action accrues when the breach\n     is or should have been discovered.\n\nId.  Thus, like the tort and contract causes of action subject to\n   \n\nthe  judicial discovery rule, a  cause of action  for breach of a\n\nwarranty of future performance is tolled until  the plaintiff has\n\nadequate notice of the claim.\n\n     The district court found that the  transaction at issue here\n\nwas  a sale  of goods,  and that  the UCC  therefore governs  the\n\ncontract claim.   It further determined that  Napco expressly had\n\nwarranted  the  future performance  of  the  wastewater treatment\n\nsystem, and that, consequently, the statutory discovery provision\n\napplies.   Because  we  have concluded  that  the district  court\n\ncorrectly ruled as a  matter of law that the parties entered into\n\na sale  of goods, and there  is no challenge to  its finding that\n\nNapco  gave  an  explicit  warranty of  future  performance,  the\n\ntimeliness  of  all  of  plaintiff's  claims  is  linked  to  the\n\ndiscovery rule.    \n\n                               IV.\n\n     Our  analysis of  the discovery rule's  impact in  this case\n\nmust  begin with the parties'  conflicting views on  how the rule\n\noperates.   Defendant Napco asserts that the rule applies only to\n\n\"inherently unknowable\"  causes of  action and that  the question\n\nbefore us is whether Cambridge Plating's claims were discoverable\n\nthrough  reasonably  diligent  efforts.6   If  Cambridge  Plating\n\n                    \n\n     6  Although  the  dictionary  definition  suggests  that  an\n\"inherently\" unknowable  claim is  one that would  be permanently\n                                                                 \nundiscoverable, see  The Random  House Dictionary of  the English\n                                                                 \n\n                               -11-\n\ncould  have  discovered  its claims  earlier  through  reasonable\n     \n\ndiligence,  Napco  maintains,  then   they  were  not  inherently\n                                                                 \n\nunknowable and the discovery rule would not apply.\n\n     Cambridge Plating  counters  that the  applicability of  the\n\ndiscovery rule does not depend on whether it was possible for the\n\ncompany  to  discover  Napco's  responsibility  for  the  defects\n\nearlier  by pursuing some other reasonable course of action.  The\n\ninquiry, it asserts, must focus on the reasonableness of what the\n\ncompany actually did.  If the company acted diligently, but still\n\nreasonably  failed to learn of its cause of action, the discovery\n\nrule would continue to delay the limitations clock.\n\n     The  district  court  adopted  Napco's  view,  finding  that\n\nCambridge Plating could have discovered the system's defects once\n\nthe  company  learned  that  the water  treatment  equipment  was\n\nfailing to  bring effluent discharges  within legal limits.

Bowen makes it clear  that the\n                                        \n\nsteps taken by a plaintiff to discover her cause of action play a\n\nrole  in the decision whether  to apply the  discovery rule: \"the\n\ndecision  whether  any  [injury]  should  reasonably   have  been\n\nuncovered  ha[s] to be made  in light of  what reasonable inquiry\n\nwould have disclosed.\"  Id. at 206 (citing Friedman, 371 Mass. at\n                                                   \n\n485-86).  Accrual of  the plaintiff's cause of action  is tested,\n\ntherefore, \"by  what a reasonable  person in  her position  would\n\n                               -14-\n\nhave known or  on inquiry  would have discovered  at the  various\n\nrelevant times,\" Bowen, 408 Mass. at 210.\n                      \n\n     Thus, if Cambridge Plating acted  reasonably diligently when\n\nit  hired the first expert,  the fact that  that expert failed to\n\ndiscover the  system's  defects must  be sufficient  to toll  the\n\nstatute  of limitations.7    This is  so  because, if  reasonable\n\ninquiry  failed to disclose the  problem, it cannot  be said that\n\nthe problem  \"should reasonably have been  uncovered,\" Bowen, 408\n                                                            \n\nMass. at 206.8\n\n     We recognize that the district  court's interpretation finds\n\nliteral  support  in the  language of  a  number of  cases, which\n\ndescribe  the discovery  rule as  applicable only  to \"inherently\n\nunknowable\"  claims or refer to the time when a plaintiff \"could\"\n\nhave known of his claim.

When  a plaintiff has\n\nmade no reasonable  efforts to  discover the harm  or its  cause,\n\nconsidering whether a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered\n                                                 \n\nhis  claim will produce the same result as considering whether he\n\nreasonably could have  discovered it.   For example,  if a  court\n                \n\nfound that  a claim  could not  be discovered  through reasonable\n                              \n\ndiligence,  it  would be  precluding as  well  a finding  that he\n\nreasonably  should have  discovered it.   See,  e.g.,  White, 386\n                                                            \n\nMass.  at 130  (in cases  cited, \"the  nature of  the defendant's\n\nwrong was such that  the plaintiff did not discover and could not\n\nreasonably  have discovered that he or she had been injured until\n\n[a later time]\").\n\n                               -16-\n\n     Similarly,  a court  might find that,  if the  plaintiff had\n\nbeen  diligent, she could have  discovered her claim.   From this\n                         \n\nconclusion, lacking  contrary information, it also  is logical to\n\npresume  that the  plaintiff  should have  discovered her  claim.\n                                    \n\nHaving  failed to act, the  plaintiff has no  basis for disputing\n\nthe  court's sensible  presumption that reasonable  actions would\n\nhave produced results.

Because none\n\nof  the cases  cited to  us present  that situation,  and because\n\nconstruing the rule as the district court applied it  effectively\n\nwould  take away the protection the discovery rule is designed to\n\nprovide, we  are confident that  Cambridge Plating's view  of the\n\ndiscovery rule is correct.\n\n     We think it worth emphasizing  that, so construed, the  rule\n\ndoes   not  permit  a  plaintiff  to  buy  time  by  engaging  an\n\nincompetent \"expert.\"  Hiring an individual  who is poorly suited\n\nto  investigate the type of  injury suffered by  the plaintiff is\n\n                               -17-\n\nunlikely to be deemed  \"reasonable\" inquiry sufficient to suspend\n\nthe  limitations  period.     Moreover,  even  if  the  plaintiff\n\nreasonably hires a professional he believes to be  competent, but\n\nwho fails to  discover a  defect that a  qualified expert  easily\n\nshould  have found, the plaintiff's only recourse is likely to be\n\nagainst the deficient professional.  The discovery rule would not\n\nsave the overlooked claim  because reasonable inquiry should have\n                                                            \n\nput the  plaintiff on notice of  it.

The  rule does not suspend the  running of the limitations\n\nperiod  pending confirmation  of  the plaintiff's  injury or  its\n\ncause, but simply  stops the  clock until the  occurrence of  \"an\n\nevent or  events .  . .  that were reasonably  likely to  put the\n\nplaintiff on notice  that someone  may have  caused her  injury,\"\n                                      \n\nBowen, 408 Mass. at 207 (emphasis added).  Thus,  a plaintiff who\n     \n\nin the 1970s was told that her injury may have been caused by her\n\nmother's ingestion of DES was unable to invoke the discovery rule\n\nto save  the lawsuit she filed a decade later, when she felt more\n\ncertain of the causal connection.  See id. at 209-10.\n                                          \n\n     Applying  these principles  to the  case at  hand, Cambridge\n\nPlating's  ability to invoke the  discovery rule --  and thus the\n\ntimeliness of its claims -- turns on when the company should have\n\nknown that Napco  might be  responsible for  the water  treatment\n\nsystem's failing  performance.   In  Section  V, we  discuss  our\n\n                               -18-\n\nconclusion  that this question must  be answered by  the trier of\n\nfact.

No one suggests that\n                   \n\nCambridge  Plating  in  fact  knew the  source  of  the  system's\n\nproblems before  early 1989, and  the issue therefore  is whether\n\nthere is a factual  dispute over whether the company  should have\n\nrealized Napco's possible responsibility before that date.\n\n     A  careful analysis of the  record persuades us  that such a\n\ndispute  exists.  In finding that Cambridge Plating was on notice\n\nof its claims in late 1985, the district court  relied heavily on\n\nthe company's having  learned at  that time that  the system  was\n\nfailing to  bring effluent discharges down  to acceptable levels.\n\nThe  court  felt  that   Cambridge  Plating's  knowledge  of  the\n\ndeficiencies meant that it knew that the performance warranty was\n\nbeing breached.  Additionally,  consistent with its understanding\n\n                    \n\n     9  The lawsuit was filed on June  22, 1990.  As discussed in\nSection III,  supra, certain of the claims have four-year, rather\n                   \nthan three-year,  statutes of limitation, and  those claims would\nbe  timely even  if  Cambridge Plating  learned  of them  a  year\nearlier, in  1986.  For the sake  of simplicity, because it makes\nno  difference in  the result,  we discuss the  claims as  if all\nneeded to be filed within three years of their discovery. \n\n                               -19-\n\nof the discovery rule, see Section IV supra, the court ruled that\n                                           \n\nCambridge Plating was then on notice of the other claims as well.\n\n     The system's inadequate performance  in late 1985 strikes us\n\nas  far less portentous.  Beyond doubt, when the system first was\n\ninstalled,  and throughout  Napco's debugging  process, Cambridge\n\nPlating had no reason to suspect the serious flaws.   Omission of\n\nthe  static  mixer  was virtually  impossible  for  anyone but  a\n\nwastewater treatment expert to  discover, both because the device\n\nwas  supposed to  be located  inside a  pipe and  because Napco's\n                                    \n\ndiagrams  indicated that  it had been  installed.   Moreover, any\n\ndeficiencies presumably  were to be resolved  once Napco finished\n\nits finetuning.\n\n     When  the  problems persisted  despite  Napco's announcement\n\nthat debugging  was complete, two explanations theoretically were\n\navailable.  Either  the system  itself was defective,  or it  was\n\nbeing  operated  improperly.   At  this point,  however,  the two\n\npossibilities were not equally  weighted.  Cambridge Plating knew\n\nthat the  system was  technically complex and  required sensitive\n\noperation.   And  Napco's  only response  to Cambridge  Plating's\n\ninquiries was to suggest ways to improve operation.\n\n     In these circumstances, we  do not believe Massachusetts law\n\nrequires  a finding that Cambridge  Plating was on  notice of the\n\nsystem's defects.  A plaintiff is sufficiently aware of her cause\n\nof  action,  and thus  should have  discovered  it, once  she has\n\nreceived  \"notice  of  likely cause,\"  Fidler,  714  F.2d at  199\n                                             \n\n(quoted  in  Bowen, 408  Mass. at  207-08).   Accordingly,  as we\n                  \n\n                               -20-\n\nunderstand the requisite notice,  the statute of limitations will\n\nbegin  to run once the plaintiff has enough information to target\n\nthe defendant  as a suspect,  though not necessarily  to identify\n\nthe  defendant as the culprit.   See Bowen,  408 Mass. at 207-08.\n                                          \n\nWe think it within  a factfinder's province to conclude  that, in\n\nlate 1985,  Cambridge Plating had no basis for suspecting Napco's\n\nworkmanship  and  reasonably  attributed  the  system's  problems\n\nsolely to  its own deficient  operation.   If so, the  statute of\n\nlimitations would not yet have begun to run.10\n\n     Cambridge  Plating  hired new  operators,  but  the problems\n\npersisted.    So, in  late 1986,  the  company engaged  its first\n\nexpert evaluation of  the system.   This, too,  resulted in  only\n\noperational suggestions.  Should  this expert have discovered the\n\ndefects?   Again, we believe this is a question properly answered\n\nby the trier  of fact.   The record  contains little  information\n\nabout  the  first expert,  describing  him only  as  an assistant\n\ninstructor  for  a wastewater  treatment  course  at a  community\n\ncollege who \"worked on waste treatment for Hewlett Packard.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nAffidavit of Edward Marullo, at 2.   Was he competent to evaluate\n\nthe  system?  Would even a well qualified expert necessarily have\n\nuncovered the problem based on what  he knew about the system  at\n\n                    \n\n     10  The facts here contrast  with those in  White v. Peabody\n                                                                 \nConstruction Co.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2046989\"><a href=\"/opinion/2046989/white-v-peabody-construction-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982),  where plaintiffs sought\n                \nto  recover damages  resulting  from widespread  window and  roof\nleaks  allegedly  caused  by  defendants'   improper  design  and\nconstruction  of   a  housing   project.    The   court  rejected\napplication of  the discovery  rule there because  the plaintiffs\n\"reasonably should  have known that  widespread water leaks  in a\nnewly  constructed building  are almost  certainly the  result of\ndesign or construction defects.\"  Id. at 130.\n                                     \n\n                               -21-\n\nthat point?  Was it reasonable to rely on the schematics provided\n\nby Napco showing that a static mixer had been installed?  Perhaps\n\nthe  second expert discovered the defects  only because, in light\n\nof the earlier  expert's reasonable work, a more exhaustive study\n\nnow appeared necessary.11\n\n     Because   the   record   leaves  these   subsidiary   issues\n\nunresolved,  factual  questions  remain as  to  whether Cambridge\n\nPlating should  have known  even by  the end  of 1986  of Napco's\n\npossible  responsibility  for  the  system's failings.    If  the\n\nexpert's failure  to discover the defects was  reasonable, a jury\n\ncould find that Cambridge Plating continued to deserve protection\n\nfrom the discovery rule beyond that time.12\n\n     Whether  the rule's  impact, assuming  it reached  this far,\n\ncontinued  on  through the  time of  actual  discovery is  also a\n\nmatter  for jury deliberation.  Was it reasonable for the company\n\nto  wait another two years before seeking additional advice?  Was\n\nthere a point in  time after Cambridge Plating had  complied with\n\nall of the  first expert's suggestions, still  without any change\n\nin the  system's performance, that the  company reasonably should\n\nhave realized that Napco's work may have been to blame?\n\n                    \n\n     11 An affidavit from the second expert, Peter Moleux, states\nthat, in his opinion, \"the defects in the system  could have been\ndiscovered  only by someone  with expertise  and training  in the\nfield  similar  to mine  and only  after  a lengthy  and thorough\ninspection and analysis.\"  See App. at 179   33.  Moleux reported\n                              \nthat he spent \"many days\" identifying the system's problems. \n\n     12  Of  course,  claims  subject  to  four-year  limitations\nperiods  would be timely even  if the discovery  rule only tolled\nthe running of the clock through the end of 1986.\n\n                               -22-\n\n     In  short,  many  questions   remain.    To  determine  when\n\nCambridge  Plating \"reasonably  should have  discovered\" that  it\n\nmight have  claims against Napco  requires a  review of  specific\n\ncircumstances  about which the  record presently contains sketchy\n\ninformation.  Consequently, the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment must be set aside.13\n\n     Reversed and remanded. No costs.\n                                    \n\n                    \n\n     13  We  are unpersuaded  by Cambridge  Plating's alternative\ntheories  that  the  statutes   were  tolled  because  (1)  Napco\nconcealed  omission of  the  static mixer  and  (2) Napco  had  a\nfiduciary duty to disclose the omission but failed to do so.
