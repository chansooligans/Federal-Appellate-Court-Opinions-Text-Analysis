This appeal by Southern Union, a\n\nnatural gas company convicted by a jury of storing hazardous waste\n\nwithout a permit, raises two issues of initial impression.                 First,\n\nthe case tests whether federal criminal enforcement may be used\n\nunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6928(d), where certain federally approved state regulations as to\n\nhazardous waste storage have been violated.            Second, the case also\n\nraises the important question of whether a criminal fine must be\n\nvacated under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), where a\n\njudge, and not a jury, determined the facts as to the number of\n\ndays of violation under a schedule of fines.\n\n           The hazardous waste at issue in this case is mercury,\n\nwhich can poison and kill those exposed to it.                 See 40 C.F.R.\n\n§   261.33(f)   tbl.    (listing   mercury    as   hazardous      waste    due   to\n\ntoxicity).      Here, 140 pounds of mercury became the play toy of\n\nyoung vandals who spread it about, including at their homes in a\n\nlocal apartment complex, after they spilled it around Southern\n\nUnion's   largely      abandoned   and    ill-guarded    Tidewater        site   in\n\nPawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\n           We    affirm   the   district     court's    rulings    on     Southern\n\nUnion's conviction, as set forth in United States v. Southern\n\nUnion, 643 F. Supp. 2d 201 (D.R.I. 2009) (Southern Union I).                     We\n\nconclude that:\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(1) Southern Union is precluded by 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b) from\n\nchallenging the EPA's 2002 Immediate Final Rule authorizing Rhode\n\nIsland's RCRA regulations.    Having failed to use the statutory\n\nprocedure for judicial review, Southern Union may not raise the\n\nissue by collateral attack;\n\n(2) the 2002 Rule, in any event, is valid and was within the EPA's\n\nauthority to adopt; and\n\n(3) the conviction does not violate Southern Union's right to fair\n\nnotice under the Due Process Clause.\n\n          We also affirm the fine imposed.   The Apprendi issue is\n\nclose but the Supreme Court's recent decision in Oregon v. Ice, 129\n\nS. Ct. 711 (2009), leads us to hold that the Apprendi rule does not\n\napply to the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines.       If,\n\nhowever, we were wrong in our assessment of the Apprendi issue, we\n\nwould find that any error under Apprendi was not harmless and that\n\nthe issue of the fine would need to be remanded.   Finally, we also\n\nhold that the financial penalties imposed did not constitute an\n\nabuse of the district court's discretion.\n\n         I. SOUTHERN UNION'S MERCURY STORAGE AND RELEASE\n\n          Southern Union, a Texas-based natural gas distributor,\n\nbegan supplying natural gas to Rhode Island and Massachusetts\n\ncustomers in 2000 through a subsidiary, New England Gas Company,\n\nthat it formed after acquiring several local gas companies.     It\n\nstopped serving Rhode Island customers in 2006.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f           As part of the transactions in 2000, Southern Union\n\nacquired a twelve-acre complex, once used as a gas manufacturing\n\nplant, on Tidewater Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Most of the\n\ncomplex sat unused, but Southern Union used a few buildings for\n\nautomated monitoring and used outdoor spaces to store construction\n\nsupplies and waste.\n\n           The Tidewater property was not maintained and had fallen\n\ninto disrepair.    The perimeter fence was rusted, with gaps that\n\nwere left unrepaired. There were no security cameras, and Southern\n\nUnion had removed the single part-time security guard from the site\n\nby September 2004.    Southern Union was aware that homeless people\n\nwere staying in a tin shed on the property, and that the property\n\nwas frequently vandalized.\n\n           In June 2001, Southern Union began removing outdated\n\nmercury-sealed gas regulators (MSRs) from customers' homes and\n\nreplacing them with updated regulators. The old MSRs were taken to\n\na brick building at the Tidewater facility.      There, for about five\n\nmonths,   an   environmental   firm   removed   the   mercury   from   the\n\nregulators and shipped it to a recycling facility, leaving the\n\nregulators to be cleaned and scrapped.          Southern Union stopped\n\nremoving MSRs as a matter of course in November 2001, and its\n\narrangement with the environmental firm ended in December 2001.\n\nHowever, Southern Union continued to remove MSRs whenever they\n\nmalfunctioned, bringing them to Tidewater, where they were \"stored\"\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fin doubled plastic bags placed in plastic kiddie pools on the floor\n\nof the brick building.\n\n              Employees were also encouraged to bring any loose mercury\n\nthey found in their departments to Tidewater, where it was placed\n\nin the same building as the gas regulators.              The loose mercury was\n\nstored in the various containers in which it arrived, including a\n\nmilk   jug,    a   paint   can,   glass   jars,    and   plastic   containers.\n\nSouthern Union kept the containers in a locked wooden cabinet that\n\nwas not designed for mercury storage.              The brick building was in\n\npoor condition and had suffered break-in attempts and vandalism.\n\nIt had many broken windows and its walls were covered in graffiti.\n\nNeither the cabinet nor the building itself contained any warning\n\nnotice that hazardous substances were inside.\n\n              Southern Union had no use for any of the mercury it\n\naccumulated.        By   July   2004,   when   a   Southern   Union   employee\n\ncatalogued the contents of the brick building, it held 165 MSRs and\n\napproximately 1.25 gallons, or more than 140 pounds, of loose\n\nmercury (two tablespoons of mercury weigh just under one pound).\n\nThat cataloguing did not lead the company to arrange for recycling,\n\nto secure the building, or to secure a storage permit from the\n\nstate.\n\n              Southern Union was well aware that the mercury was piling\n\nup and that it was kept in unsafe conditions.               The Environmental\n\nServices Manager for its New England Gas Company division, who\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftestified that he was concerned about the safety risk the mercury\n\nposed to the company's employees, drafted proposed Requests for\n\nProposals (RFPs) in 2002, 2003, and 2004 to solicit bids to remove\n\nand dispose of or recycle the regulators \"and associated wastes.\"\n\n            The    2002   draft    was    sent   to   Southern       Union's   Texas\n\ncorporate headquarters for review by the Director of Environmental\n\nServices, where it died.          Not only was the RFP not issued, but the\n\nNew England Gas Company engineer who oversaw the environmental\n\ndepartment became angry when he was repeatedly asked about it. The\n\n2003 proposed RFP met the same fate, even though it specified the\n\ncontents of a number of different containers of mercury.                        The\n\ndraft,    titled   \"Request       for    Proposals    for    Waste    Segregation,\n\nPackaging, Transportation, and Disposal,\" sought a bid to \"[r]emove\n\nliquid mercury from several small containers\" and \"[t]ransport and\n\ndispose (or recycle) of all waste generated\" by this work (emphasis\n\nadded).    Nor did anything come of the 2004 proposed RFP, even\n\nthough the environmental manager went outside his chain of command\n\ntrying to get the RFP issued to vendors.\n\n            The safety risk posed by the conditions under which the\n\nmercury was stored was discussed at joint employee-management\n\nsafety    committee   meetings      in    May,   June,      and   September    2004.\n\nIndeed, the employee who brought a regulator in on September 20,\n\n2004 was so concerned about the accumulating mercury that he raised\n\nthe issue with his supervisor.            No action was taken.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          In late September 2004, youths from a nearby apartment\n\ncomplex broke into the brick building, broke open the wooden\n\ncabinet, found the mercury, and, playing with it, spilled some of\n\nit in and around the building.   They also took some of the mercury\n\nback to their apartment complex, where they spilled more on the\n\nground, dipped cigarettes in it, and tossed some in the air.\n\nMercury was tracked into the residences when people walked through\n\nit and was found in several homes.\n\n          Southern Union discovered the break-in and spills on\n\nOctober 19, roughly three weeks later, when a worker found pancake-\n\nsized puddles of mercury around the brick building. Southern Union\n\nimmediately called in a contractor to begin cleaning up the spills\n\nat Tidewater and the apartment complex.\n\n          A Southern Union employee also left a voicemail message\n\nthat day for Jim Ball, the Emergency Response Coordinator at the\n\nstate Department of Environmental Management.    However, Southern\n\nUnion did not contact the Pawtucket Fire Department or the state\n\nFire Marshal, the designated points of contact for a release of\n\nmore than a pound of mercury.    The Fire Department did not arrive\n\nat Tidewater until the next day, after having found out about the\n\nspill from the Department of Environmental Management.     By that\n\ntime, the contractor had already removed the remaining mercury from\n\nthe building and begun to ship it offsite.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Altogether,    the    company   spent   more   than    $6   million\n\nremediating the two spill sites.           All five buildings in the\n\napartment complex were evacuated.         Residents, 150 of them, were\n\ndisplaced for two months.       Most were tested for mercury levels in\n\ntheir blood.   While some had elevated levels, none met current\n\nstandards for hazardous exposure.\n\n                II. CHALLENGES TO THE CONVICTION\n\n          In 2007, a federal grand jury returned a three-count\n\nindictment against Southern Union. The indictment charged Southern\n\nUnion with two counts of storing hazardous waste without a permit\n\nin violation of RCRA.    See 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(2)(A).         Count One of\n\nthe indictment covered the loose liquid mercury, and Count Three\n\ncovered the mercury-embedded gas regulators.             Count Two of the\n\nindictment charged Southern Union with failing to properly report\n\na mercury release of more than one pound, a violation of the\n\nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.1         See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 11004, 11045(b)(4).\n\n          Southern Union's prime defense at trial was that the\n\nmercury was not a waste, but rather was a commercial chemical\n\nproduct that the company intended to recycle.        Even if the mercury\n\nwas not a commercial chemical product, the Company argued, it had\n\nnot \"knowingly stored a hazardous waste\" because it believed the\n\nmercury was recyclable.        After a nearly four-week trial, a jury\n\n\n     1\n          Fifty-five plaintiffs filed related civil litigation.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fconvicted Southern Union on Count One only.          Southern Union I, 643\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 207.\n\n            Just before trial, Southern Union filed a motion arguing\n\nthat the federal government lacked authority to enforce Rhode\n\nIsland's regulations governing small quantity generators, under\n\nwhich Southern Union was prosecuted, because they were \"broader in\n\nscope\" than the federal RCRA program and therefore not part of the\n\nfederally approved and federally enforceable state program.              The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and Southern Union renewed it\n\nafter the jury verdict in a motion for a judgment of acquittal.2\n\n            The district court denied the motion for acquittal in a\n\npublished opinion issued July 22, 2009, finding Southern Union's\n\nchallenge     untimely   under   42   U.S.C.   §   6976(b),   which   governs\n\njudicial review of the EPA's authorization of state hazardous waste\n\nprograms.     Southern Union I, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 209-10.        The court\n\nhighlighted the statute's specific prohibition against judicial\n\nreview   of    such   authorizations    in     \"criminal   proceedings   for\n\nenforcement.\"    Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b)).        The court in the\n\nalternative rejected Southern Union's challenge on the merits,\n\nfinding that the authorization was a valid, binding legislative\n\nrule that authorized federal enforcement.           Id. at 210-13.\n\n\n\n     2\n          Southern Union also filed a Rule 33 motion for a new\ntrial.   The district court denied the motion, United States v.\nSouthern Union Co., 643 F. Supp. 2d 201, 217 (D.R.I. 2009)\n(Southern Union I), and Southern Union does not appeal the denial.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          Southern        Union    challenges        the        district       court's\n\napplication   of   RCRA    and    the    2002     Rule    and    claims    that    the\n\nprosecution   violated      due    process.              We   review      legal    and\n\nconstitutional questions de novo.               United States v. Sampson, 486\n\nF.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2007).       Southern Union does not challenge the\n\ndistrict court's factual determinations pertinent to the issue.\n\nBoth of Southern Union's claims of error fail.\n\nA.        Legal Structure\n\n          RCRA, 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq., regulates the \"treatment,\n\nstorage, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste\" in order to\n\nminimize the waste generated and the harm done by that waste.\n\nMeghrigh v. KFC W., Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 483 (1996).                            It is a\n\nfederal crime to knowingly store hazardous waste, such as mercury\n\nwaste, \"without a permit under this subchapter,\" that is, under 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 6921-6939f, inclusive.               42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(2)(A); 40\n\nC.F.R. § 261.33(f) tbl (listing mercury as hazardous waste).\n\nWithin that subchapter, § 6926 directs the EPA to authorize states\n\nto enforce their own hazardous waste programs \"in lieu of\" the\n\nfederal program, if the state programs are \"equivalent to\" and\n\n\"consistent   with\"   the    baseline          federal    program.        42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 6926(b).\n\n          The effect of the statute is that there is federal\n\nenforcement, including federal criminal enforcement, of state rules\n\nthat are part of federally authorized state plans under RCRA. This\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcourt so held in United States v. MacDonald & Watson Waste Oil Co.,\n\n933 F.2d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).                Southern Union does not contest\n\nthis   proposition.          Rather,       it   argues     that   the    Rhode      Island\n\nregulations enforced here are not part of a federally authorized\n\nstate plan.\n\n           Under      §    6926,     the    EPA    has    promulgated         regulations\n\ngoverning federal approval of state programs, which provide that\n\nstates may adopt and enforce requirements that are \"more stringent\"\n\nor have a \"greater scope of coverage\" than the federal baseline\n\nprogram.   40 C.F.R. § 271.1(i).                However, for state programs with\n\n\"a greater scope of coverage,\" the \"additional coverage\" does not\n\nbecome   part    of   the     federally         approved    program.           40   C.F.R.\n\n§   271.1(i)(2).          Southern    Union      argues    that   the    Rhode      Island\n\nregulations applicable here provide additional coverage.\n\n           Rhode      Island       has     administered       its       own     federally\n\nauthorized hazardous waste program since 1986, and has secured\n\nfederal approval of amendments from time to time.                   See 67 Fed. Reg.\n\n51,765, 51,766 (Aug. 9, 2002).                    Pertinent here is the EPA's\n\nauthorization of further amendments to the state program on August\n\n9, 2002.        Id. at 51,765.           On that date, the EPA published an\n\n\"Immediate final rule\" (the \"2002 Rule\") in the Federal Register\n\nunder which the authorization would automatically go into effect on\n\nOctober 8, 2002, unless the EPA received a comment in opposition to\n\nthe authorization within thirty days.                Id. at 51,765, 51,766.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f           The 2002 Rule explained that the major difference between\n\nthe new Rhode Island program and the federal baseline program was\n\nthat Rhode Island now regulated conditionally exempt small quantity\n\ngenerators    (CESQGs)   more   stringently   than   did   the   federal\n\nregulations.3    Under the federal baseline program, CESQGs are\n\nexempt from many requirements--including the permit requirement--\n\nthat are imposed on generators of higher quantities of hazardous\n\nwaste.    40 C.F.R. §§ 261.5(a)(2) (outlining limited regulation of\n\nCESQGs), 270.1(c) (generally requiring permits to store hazardous\n\nwaste).\n\n           Relying on the federal conditional exemption, Southern\n\nUnion says it was a CESQG and therefore not required to have a\n\npermit.    But the 2002 Rule made two things clear.        One was that\n\nunder Rhode Island law, Southern Union needed a permit.             The\n\nsecond, tellingly, was that this tighter regulation was going to be\n\nfederally enforced.4\n\n\n     3\n          The   federal  program   categorizes  hazardous   waste\ngenerators by the amount of hazardous waste they produce monthly.\nA hazardous waste generator qualifies as a conditionally exempt\nsmall quantity generator (CESQG) for a given month if it produces\nless than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste in that month and has\naccumulated no more than 1000 kilograms on-site.       40 C.F.R.\n§ 261.5(a), (g)(2). In addition to complying with these limits,\nCESQGs must comply with regulations governing the categorization,\ntreatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes.       See 40 C.F.R.\n§§ 261.5(g)(1), (3); 262.11.\n     4\n          The Rule also made it clear that a different part of the\nregulation, not at issue here, would not be federally enforced,\nindicating EPA did not simply assume all additional state\nrequirements were federally enforceable.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          Southern Union did not comment; in fact, the EPA received\n\nno comments from the public.     Nor did Southern Union take any\n\naction to seek judicial review of the EPA's final determination.\n\nB.        Southern Union's Challenge\n\n          Southern Union argues that Rhode Island's regulation of\n\nCESQGs, under which it was prosecuted for storing loose mercury\n\nwithout a permit, cannot, merely by virtue of the 2002 Rule, be the\n\nbasis for federal criminal prosecution.   From this it argues that\n\nthe district court erred in refusing to put the question of whether\n\nit was a CESQG under federal law to the jury.   It argues that only\n\nthe part of a state's hazardous waste program that is \"required by\n\nfederal law\" becomes part of the state's federally authorized--and\n\ntherefore federally enforceable--program.   Southern Union has put\n\nthe cart before the horse.\n\n          1. Southern Union Is Precluded By 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b)\n          from Attacking Federal Criminal Enforcement of the\n          Federally Authorized State Rule\n\n          In enacting RCRA, Congress clearly channeled and limited\n\nthe mechanism for judicial review of EPA authorizations:\n\n     Review of the Administrator's action (1) in issuing,\n     denying, modifying, or revoking any permit under section\n     6925 of this title . . . or (2) in granting, denying, or\n     withdrawing authorization or interim authorization under\n     section 6926 of this title, may be had by any interested\n     person in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United\n     States for the Federal judicial district in which such\n     person   resides  or   transacts   such  business   upon\n     application by such person. Any such application shall\n     be made within ninety days from the date of such\n     issuance, denial, modification, revocation, grant, or\n     withdrawal, or after such date only if such application\n\n                               -13-\n\f       is based solely on grounds which arose after such\n       ninetieth day. Action of the Administrator with respect\n       to which review could have been obtained under this\n       subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in\n       civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.     Such\n       review shall be in accordance with sections 701 through\n       706 of Title 5.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 6976(b) (emphasis added).\n\n                  Two     of      the       statute's    mechanisms      are     involved     here.\n\nFirst, under § 6976(b), judicial review of the EPA Administrator's\n\nactions in granting authorization (or interim authorization) to\n\nstate programs under RCRA may be had in the pertinent federal court\n\nof appeals within ninety days of issuance of the authorization.\n\nSuch        review      is       to    be    in   accordance      with   the     Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. It is undisputed that Southern\n\nUnion failed to challenge the 2002 Rule in this manner.                                   Second,\n\nwhen review of the Administrator's actions could have been obtained\n\nunder        §    6976,          the    statute        denies     judicial     review    of     the\n\nAdministrator's              action          in   \"civil     or   criminal     proceedings      for\n\nenforcement.\"5\n\n                  This congressional channeling of the forum, method, and\n\ntiming of judicial review and exclusion of collateral attacks is\n\nnot         unusual.              The        Comprehensive        Environmental         Response,\n\nCompensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) has a similar provision,\n\nsee    42        U.S.C.      §    9613(a),        as    do   several     other    environmental\n\n\n        5\n          The extension of time for challenging actions of the\nAdministrator on grounds that arise after the ninetieth day is not\napplicable here.\n\n                                                    -14-\n\fstatutes, see 33 U.S.C. §§ 1369(b), 2717(a); 42 U.S.C. §§ 300j-7,\n\n4915(a), 7607(b).        Courts have upheld such channeling.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Walsh, 8 F.3d 659, 664 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"[T]here\n\nis nothing to prevent Congress from providing a single national\n\nforum for the litigation of [asbestos removal] standards [under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 7607(b)].\"); Chrysler Corp. v. EPA, 600 F.2d 904, 912-14\n\n(D.C.    Cir.   1979)    (applying       42     U.S.C.    §   4915).    The    CERCLA\n\nprovision, to take one example, was enforced in a cost-recovery\n\naction to preclude the corporate defendant's collateral attack on\n\na Superfund site listing.             See United States v. Asarco, Inc., 214\n\nF.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 2000).6                   Southern Union has not argued\n\nthat § 6976(b) is itself unconstitutional.\n\n              The federal circuit courts construing § 6976(b) and the\n\nsimilar review provision in § 6976(a) have unanimously rejected\n\nlater collateral attacks on the Administrator's decisions.                       See\n\nSafe Food & Fertilizer v. EPA, 350 F.3d 1263, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2003)\n\n(rejecting,      under      §    6976(a),       an    \"impermissible    'back-door'\n\nchallenge\" to rulemaking); Chem. Weapons Working Grp., Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep't    of   the   Army,       111   F.3d    1485,    1491-93   (9th   Cir.   1997);\n\nGreenpeace, Inc. v. Waste Techs. Indus., 9 F.3d 1174, 1180-82 (6th\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          Southern Union's argument about § 6976(b) is presented in\nits reply brief. Arguments initially made in a reply brief are\nusually deemed waived. See United States v. Hall, 557 F.3d 15, 20\nn.3 (1st Cir. 2009). But we bypass any issue of waiver and resolve\nthe preclusion issue on the merits.\n\n                                             -15-\n\fCir. 1993); Palumbo v. Waste Techs. Indus., 989 F.2d 156, 159-62\n\n(4th Cir. 1993).\n\n               In its reply brief, Southern Union argues that there is\n\na distinction between a challenge to an authorization and \"a\n\nchallenge to the [federal] [g]overnment's authority to enforce\n\nRhode       Island's   CESQG   permit   requirement.\"    There   is   no   such\n\ndistinction.       It is the Administrator's authorization in the 2002\n\nRule that is under attack.              Once that authorization is given\n\nthrough the Administrator's findings under 40 C.F.R. Part 271,\n\nwhich provides the requirements for federal authorization of state\n\nprograms, federal enforcement follows automatically as a matter of\n\nlaw.        MacDonald, 933 F.2d at 44.         As Judge Wilkinson noted in\n\nPalumbo, the defendant's position \"[a]t bottom . . . is nothing\n\nmore than a collateral attack on the prior . . . decisions of the\n\nfederal EPA.       The RCRA judicial review provision plainly forbids\n\nsuch an attack, in place of a direct appeal.\"           Palumbo, 989 F.2d at\n\n159.\n\n               We wish to be clear: whether or not Southern Union had\n\nfiled an action within ninety days of October 8, 2002 challenging\n\nthe 2002 Rule, we may not under § 6976 review a defense in a\n\ncriminal proceeding that the EPA's action was legally in error.7\n\n\n        7\n          In its reply brief Southern Union attempts to argue that\nit could not have challenged the 2002 Rule within ninety days\nbecause there was no final agency action to challenge. That, it\nargues, is because the operative language was a mere \"preamble.\"\nIt then merges this into an attack on the merits of the regulation,\n\n                                        -16-\n\f            Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution we go on to\n\nexamine the legality of the EPA's actions and conclude in an\n\nalternate holding that those actions withstand challenge.\n\n            2. Southern Union's Attack on the Legality of the Federal\n            Authorization of Rhode Island's Regulation of CESQGs\n            Fails\n\n            Southern Union's arguments fall into several general\n\ncategories.      It argues (1) that the 2002 Rule is not a binding\n\nlegislative rule on its face for several reasons; (2) that the\n\nagency erred in its interpretation of the requirements in 40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 271.1(i), because the state rule provides a \"greater scope of\n\ncoverage\" and so cannot be within federal enforcement authority;\n\nand (3) that the 2002 Rule is invalid because it is inconsistent\n\nwith   prior    EPA   practice     and   that   inconsistency    has   not    been\n\nadequately explained or justified.\n\n            First, Southern Union challenges the authority under\n\nwhich the 2002 Rule was promulgated and the legal force of the\n\nRule's statement that Rhode Island's regulation of CESQGs is\n\nfederally      enforceable.   Southern      Union     claims,   without   citing\n\nauthority,     that   the   \"EPA    delegated    to    the   Regions   only    the\n\nresponsibility to authorize state RCRA programs under Section\n\n6926(b),\" not \"to determine or expand the breadth of federal\n\nenforcement authority.\"            But the EPA has a statutory duty to\n\n\n\narguing that it is not a \"binding\" or \"enforceable\" determination\nby the Administrator. We address this argument below.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fapprove state programs to the extent they meet the statutory and\n\nregulatory criteria. Southern Union does not explain how the EPA--\n\nincluding the regional administrators exercising their delegated\n\nauthorization     responsibilities--can     fulfill    that    duty   without\n\nspecifying which parts of a state's program fulfill the criteria,\n\nthereby becoming federally approved and enforceable.\n\n            Still pursuing its attack on the legal force of the 2002\n\nRule, Southern Union argues that the portion of the Rule that\n\ndiscusses federal enforceability is a mere unenforceable preamble.\n\nCf. Florida Power & Light Co. v. EPA, 145 F.3d 1414, 1418-20 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998) (describing preamble to a proposed rule as not a final\n\naction for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 6976(a)).           It argues that the\n\n2002 Rule neither purports to be a binding rule nor can be one,\n\nsince it was not simultaneously codified in the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations. Cf. Brock v. Cathedral Bluffs Shale Oil Co., 796 F.2d\n\n533, 538-39 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (characterizing publication in Federal\n\nRegister as minimum threshold requirement for status as regulation,\n\nid.   at   538,   but   stating   \"[t]he   real   dividing    point   between\n\nregulations and general statements of policy is publication in the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations,\" id. at 539).\n\n            As a threshold matter, Southern Union's preamble argument\n\nis factually wrong.       Unlike the Federal Register notices in the\n\ncases Southern Union cites, the 2002 Rule was not divided into\n\nseparate preamble and rule sections and did not portray any part of\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fthe notice as \"preamble.\"8        Southern Union mischaracterizes other\n\nsalient features of the 2002 Rule as well.            The EPA authorization\n\nexpressly   stated   that   the   action     the    EPA   was   taking   was   an\n\n\"[i]mmediate final rule,\" 67 Fed. Reg. at 51,765; that it was a\n\n\"final authorization\" under 42 U.S.C. § 6926, 67 Fed. Reg. at\n\n51,765, 51,768; and that the rule would later be codified in the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, id. at 51,768.                Moreover, the EPA\n\nclearly treated the 2002 authorization as having binding legal\n\nforce,   promulgating       it    through      formal      notice-and-comment\n\nrulemaking,   and    stating     in   the    rule   itself      that   the   rule\n\nrepresented final agency action.9\n\n            Second, Southern Union presents an argument construing\n\nthe relevant federal regulation. It argues that since the baseline\n\nfederal program does not require CESQGs to obtain hazardous waste\n\n\n     8\n          Compare Natural Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 559 F.3d 561,\n565 (D.C. Cir. 2009) with 72 Fed. Reg. 13,560, 13,560, 13,580 (Mar.\n2, 2007) (Federal Register notice at issue in Natural Res. Def.\nCouncil); compare Florida Power & Light Co. v. EPA, 145 F.3d 1414,\n1414-18 (D.C. Cir. 1998), with 59 Fed. Reg. 55,778, 55,778, 55,792\n(Nov. 4, 1994) (Federal Register notice at issue in Florida Power\n& Light).\n     9\n          In applying the similar review provision in § 6976(a),\nthe D.C. Circuit examines three factors to determine whether the\nEPA has issued a \"final regulation\" under RCRA: (1) EPA's\ncharacterization of the action, (2) whether the action was\npublished in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal\nRegulations, and (3) most importantly, whether the action has a\nbinding effect on either private parties or the EPA. E.g., Cement\nKiln Recycling Coal. v. EPA, 493 F.3d 207, 226-27 (D.C. Cir. 2007);\nGen. Motors Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 442, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n(stating third factor most important). We need not address whether\nthis circuit would take a similar view.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fstorage permits, the United States cannot enforce state rules that\n\ndo.        We    reject    this    strained      interpretation   of   40   C.F.R.\n\n§ 271.1(i), which governs federal authorization of state hazardous\n\nwaste programs.         The provision reads as follows:\n\n      (i) Except as provided in § 271.4, nothing in this\n      subpart10 precludes a State from:\n\n      (1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more\n      stringent or more extensive than those required under\n      this subpart;\n\n      (2) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage\n      than that required under this subpart. Where an approved\n      State program has a greater scope of coverage than\n      required by Federal law, the additional coverage is not\n      part of the Federally approved program.\n\n                On Southern Union's interpretation of the regulation, any\n\nstate rule that is not \"required\" by the federal baseline program\n\nnecessarily imposes \"a greater scope of coverage,\" and so the\n\ndistrict        court     erred    when   it     held   that   \"more   stringent\"\n\nrequirements are federally approved while only greater-in-scope\n\nrequirements are not.             We reject Southern Union's interpretation\n\nbecause it vitiates the clear distinction between \"more stringent\"\n\nand \"greater in scope,\" collapsing the two terms into one.\n\n                Beyond that, if there were any ambiguity, we would\n\n\"afford[] 'considerable deference' to the agency's interpretation\n\nof regulations promulgated under [its statutory] authority.\" Rhode\n\n\n\n      10\n          This subpart includes 40 C.F.R. §§ 271.1-271.27\ninclusive, all of which sections specify requirements for federal\nauthorization of state programs.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fIsland Hosp. v. Leavitt, 548 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2008); see also\n\nMartex Farms, S.E. v. EPA, 559 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009).                     Here,\n\nwhere the agency has expressed that interpretation in a legislative\n\nrule        promulgated   through      notice-and-comment         rulemaking,    the\n\nagency's       interpretation     is    binding     unless   it    is    \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n\nwith law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(2), or otherwise defective under the\n\nAPA.    See Levesque v. Block, 723 F.2d 175, 182 (1st Cir. 1983); see\n\nalso Coal. for Common Sense in Gov't Procurement v. Sec'y of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 464 F.3d 1306, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating\n\nthat a substantive rule has the force and effect of law).\n\n               Southern   Union     offers     no   argument      that   the    EPA's\n\ninterpretation is arbitrary or capricious, or that the agency\n\nsomehow exceeded its statutory authority.              It argues only that its\n\nown reading is better on the plain language of the regulation.                     We\n\ndo not agree about the reading and in any event this is not enough.\n\nThe EPA's interpretation of 40 C.F.R. § 271.1(i) to permit federal\n\nenforcement of \"more stringent\" state regulations is a reasonable\n\none based on the text and structure of the regulation.11\n\n               Southern Union argues in the alternative that even if\n\n\"more stringent\" requirements are federally authorized, a state's\n\nregulation of CESQGs is \"additional coverage\" rather than merely a\n\n\n       11\n          Southern Union does not challenge the validity of 40\nC.F.R. § 271.1(i) itself (nor could it, since such a challenge\nwould be untimely under 42 U.S.C. § 6976(a)).\n\n                                        -21-\n\f\"more stringent\" requirement because it expands the universe of\n\nregulated entities to include entities that would not otherwise be\n\ncovered by RCRA.\n\n           Southern Union's argument is based on its misreading of\n\n40 C.F.R. § 261.5.      This federal regulation clearly regulates\n\nCESQGs, governing how they categorize their waste, where they may\n\nstore it, and how they may dispose of it.       40 C.F.R. § 261.5(c),\n\n(g).   This is in addition to the eligibility requirements for\n\ncategorization as a CESQG in a given month.     40 C.F.R. § 261.5(a),\n\n(g)(2). Further, because the eligibility requirements are based on\n\nthe amount of hazardous waste generated or stored in a particular\n\nmonth, CESQG status is transient, so that some generators will be\n\nCESQGs only some of the time.     It does not expand the universe of\n\nregulated entities to subject already-regulated entities to fuller\n\nregulation in Rhode Island.\n\n           Third, and finally, Southern Union strongly urges that\n\nthe 2002 Rule is invalid because it is irrationally inconsistent\n\nwith prior pronouncements of the EPA's position on the regulation\n\nof CESQGs and on which state regulations will receive federal\n\nauthorization.     Southern Union's argument relies primarily on\n\nvarious   nonbinding   EPA   guidance   documents   stemming   from   the\n\nagency's interpretations, in the 1980s, that state regulation of\n\nCESQGs was not federally enforceable.        However, these internal\n\nguidance documents have not been put forth as legally binding and\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwere not promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking, and\n\ntherefore        cannot    trump    the        agency's   formal   regulatory\n\npromulgations.      Cf. Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587\n\n(2000).\n\n            Southern Union also points in passing to prior formal EPA\n\nauthorizations of state programs--in 1992 as to California and in\n\n2001   as   to    the   District   of   Columbia--determining      that   state\n\nregulation of CESQGs was not then, in the EPA's view, federally\n\nenforceable.       See 66 Fed. Reg. 46,961, 46,965 (Sept. 10, 2001)\n\n(District of Columbia); 57 Fed. Reg. 32,726, 32,729 (July 23, 1992)\n\n(California).      Southern Union argues the 2002 EPA Rule authorizing\n\nRhode Island's program cannot be binding on the regulated community\n\nbecause it is inconsistent with these prior determinations.\n\n            We briefly explain why the 2002 Rule is not subject to\n\nattack on grounds of irrational inconsistency with other EPA\n\nauthorizations of state programs.               The facts show that Southern\n\nUnion overstates the supposed conflict.             Since 1999, with the sole\n\nexception of the District of Columbia in 2001, EPA has consistently\n\ncharacterized state regulation of CESQGs as federally enforceable.\n\nSee 72 Fed. Reg. 12,568, 12,570 (Mar. 16, 2007) (Vermont); 71 Fed.\n\nReg. 9727, 9732, 9733 (Feb. 27, 2006) (New Hampshire); 69 Fed. Reg.\n\n57,842, 57,856 (Sept. 28, 2004) (Connecticut); 64 Fed. Reg. 48,099,\n\n48,101 (Sept. 2, 1999) (Louisiana).                The District of Columbia\n\ndecision in 2001 demonstrates, at worst, an aberration, and the\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fagency has maintained a consistent position ever since.                     In this\n\nvein, EPA has issued a proposed rule making California's CESQG\n\nregulations federally enforceable.             75 Fed.

These conditions are met here.                Each state program\n\nauthorization    has    been    promulgated      through      notice-and-comment\n\nrulemaking.     And     the    change   was    clearly      rational;   the   EPA's\n\n\"reasoned basis\" for deciding state CESQG regulations are federally\n\nenforceable is clearly discernible from the very text and structure\n\nof the regulation.        See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best\n\nFreight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285-86 (1974).\n\nC.         Southern Union's Due Process Claim\n\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f             There was no lack of due notice to Southern Union that\n\nits behavior could lead to criminal prosecution.\n\n             The law embodies two commonsense notions in the face of\n\nprotestations of innocence by reason of ignorance.         One is that\n\nthose who keep dangerous materials on hand know their activity is\n\nregulated. United States v. Int'l Minerals & Chem. Corp., 402 U.S.\n\n558, 565 (1971) (\"[W]here . . . obnoxious waste materials are\n\ninvolved, the probability of regulation is so great that anyone who\n\nis aware that he is in possession of them or dealing with them must\n\nbe presumed to be aware of the regulation.\").      The other is that\n\nthose   who     manage   highly   regulated   industries     are   not\n\nunsophisticated.     Southern Union is in the natural gas industry,\n\nwhich is highly regulated both federally and locally.       It is part\n\nof its business to keep abreast of government regulation.          See\n\nUnited States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 56-57 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(stating that companies in highly regulated industries are presumed\n\nto be on notice of applicable regulatory regime).\n\n             Further, the company's activities put it in violation of\n\nstate law.    R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-19.1-18 (making violation of state\n\nhazardous waste rules a felony punishable by imprisonment, $25,000\n\nfine for each day's violation, and remediation costs).        Southern\n\nUnion does not argue it lacked notice of that.     Rather, it argues\n\nit lacked notice that it could be federally prosecuted for activity\n\nit acknowledges was a state crime.       We have held in a parallel\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fsituation that notice that conduct violates state law constitutes\n\nfair notice of a counterpart federal violation.    United States v.\n\nGagnon, 621 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n           In any event, the Environmental Services Manager for\n\nSouthern Union's New England Gas Company subsidiary received a\n\nletter in July 2002 explaining that the EPA would soon authorize\n\nrevisions to Rhode Island's hazardous waste program and inviting\n\nthe company to comment.     The company had actual notice of the\n\npublication of a Final Rule.    The ensuing federal 2002 Rule was\n\ncrystal clear on its face that the state standards would be\n\nfederally enforced. It became effective twenty-three months before\n\nthe event which led to the prosecution of Southern Union.     There\n\nwas no trap for the unwitting here.         Obliviousness is not a\n\ndefense.\n\n                    III. CHALLENGES TO THE FINE\n\n           The statutory fine for knowing storage of hazardous waste\n\nwithout a permit is \"not more than $50,000 for each day of\n\nviolation.\"   42 U.S.C. § 6928(d).   The district court imposed a $6\n\nmillion fine and a $12 million \"community service obligation.\"\n\nSouthern Union adequately preserved an objection to these penalties\n\non the grounds that the $38.1 million maximum fine calculated in\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fthe pre-sentence report violated Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466 (2000).12\n\n           Apprendi requires that \"any fact\" other than that of a\n\nprior conviction \"that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\n\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          Id. at 490.       Southern Union\n\nargued at sentencing that the court could not impose a fine greater\n\nthan $50,000, the maximum fine for a one-day violation.             That was\n\nbecause Southern Union presented evidence at trial from which the\n\njury could have found that for at least some of the period of the\n\nindictment, it had treated the loose mercury as a recyclable\n\nresource rather than as waste.        The jury, it notes, was not asked\n\nto   determine   the   number   of   days   of   violation,   but   only   \"to\n\ndetermine whether . . . at some point in time the liquid mercury\n\nwas discarded by being abandoned\" (emphasis added).\n\n           The prosecution argued that the Apprendi rule against\n\njudicial factfinding does not apply in the context of criminal\n\n\n\n      12\n          The district court found Southern Union had waived the\nApprendi argument by failing to raise the issue during discussions\nabout the structure of the jury verdict form, and raising the issue\nfor the first time in objecting to the presentence report. United\nStates v. Southern Union Co., No. 07-134, 2009 WL 2032097, at *2\n(D.R.I. July 9, 2009) (Southern Union II).          Southern Union\ndisagrees that there was waiver, given that in United States v.\nPérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2003), we found that \"[i]n\norder to preserve a claim of Apprendi error for appeal, it is\nenough that a defendant offer a timely objection at sentencing.\"\nId.   The prosecution did not seek the district court's waiver\nruling and does not press it on appeal.\n\n                                     -27-\n\ffines. The district court held that Apprendi does apply, but found\n\nit implicit in the jury verdict and the indictment on which the\n\nverdict form was based that Southern Union had violated RCRA for\n\nthe full 762 days charged in the indictment.               United States v.\n\nSouthern Union Co., No. 07-134, 2009 WL 2032097, at *3-4 (D.R.I.\n\nJuly 9, 2009) (Southern Union II).          It then used that information\n\nto calculate the maximum fine of $38.1 million.             Id. at *4.     The\n\nindictment charged conduct \"[f]rom on or about September 19, 2002\n\nuntil   on   or   about   October   19,    2004,\"   and   the   verdict   form\n\nencompassed Southern Union's conduct \"[a]s to Count 1 of the\n\nIndictment, on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.\"\n\nFrom these, the court concluded that the jury had found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Southern Union violated RCRA during the\n\nentire period from approximately September 19, 2002 until October\n\n19, 2004.     Southern Union II, 2009 WL 2032097, at *3.\n\n             On appeal, Southern Union makes two arguments challenging\n\nthe fine.     First, it argues that where the statute of conviction\n\nsets a maximum fine of $50,000 \"for each day of violation,\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 6928(d), then the issue of the number of days of violation\n\nmust be submitted to the jury under Apprendi.             Second, it argues\n\nthat the penalties imposed constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\nWhile we disagree with the district court on the Apprendi issue, we\n\nalso reject Southern Union's arguments.\n\nA.           Apprendi Does Not Apply to Criminal Fines\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\f          We start with the Apprendi argument, which presents a\n\npure issue of law, reviewed de novo.             United States v. González-\n\nVélez, 466 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir. 2006).           It is an open question in\n\nthis circuit whether Apprendi applies to criminal fines, though we\n\nhave assumed that criminal fines are subject to the rule of United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), a post-Apprendi case on the\n\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines.          United States v. Bevilacqua, 447\n\nF.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Uribe-\n\nLondoño, 409 F.3d 1, 5 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Southern     Union   argues    that     the   question   of   whether\n\nApprendi applies is resolved by the plain language of the Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion in that case, which states that the rule covers\n\n\"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\" beyond the\n\nstatutory maximum. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (emphasis added). If\n\nApprendi applies only to facts increasing terms of incarceration,\n\nand not to criminal fines, Southern Union argues, the Court's use\n\nof the broad word \"penalty\" becomes superfluous, and corporations,\n\nwhich   cannot   be    incarcerated,       are   left    outside    Apprendi's\n\nprotection.\n\n          The Supreme Court extended the Apprendi rule to new\n\ncontexts in several post-Apprendi decisions.            See Ring v. Arizona,\n\n536 U.S. 584 (2002) (applying rule to statute authorizing death\n\npenalty upon judge's finding of aggravating factor); Blakely v.\n\nWashington,   542     U.S.   296   (2004)    (applying     rule    to   statute\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fauthorizing    \"exceptional       sentence\"    upon    judge's       finding      of\n\naggravating factor); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005)\n\n(applying     rule    to    mandatory     Federal     Sentencing       Guidelines\n\nenhancements);       Cunningham   v.    California,    549    U.S.     270    (2007)\n\n(applying rule to scheme authorizing schedule of longer prison\n\nterms if judge finds aggravating circumstance).                      Under these\n\ndecisions, a judge may not mete out any \"punishment\" for which the\n\njury has not found all the necessary \"facts.\"              Blakely, 542 U.S. at\n\n304.   This has been called a \"bright-line rule.\"              Cunningham, 549\n\nU.S. at 288.         These cases do not distinguish among types of\n\n\"penalties\" or \"punishment,\" leaving the broad language unglossed.\n\nFrom this one might conclude that a fine is like all other\n\npenalties, or one could reach a different conclusion.                        What is\n\nclear is that none of these cases deals with the question of\n\nwhether the imposition of a fine falls under the Apprendi rule.\n\n            The prosecution argues that both the reasoning and the\n\nexpress language in Oregon v. Ice, 129 S. Ct. 711 (2010), mean that\n\nApprendi does not apply to criminal fines, which have historically\n\nbeen within the discretion of judges, and not assigned to juries\n\nfor determination.         In Ice, the Court upheld a state sentencing\n\nregime that allowed judges to find facts justifying the imposition\n\nof consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences of incarceration.\n\nId. at 720.    The Court characterized its decisions under Apprendi\n\nas   curtailing      any   \"legislative    attempt    to     'remove    from     the\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f[province of the] jury' the determination of facts that warrant\n\npunishment for a specific statutory offense.\"              Id. at 718 (quoting\n\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 490) (alteration in original).                   The Court,\n\nreasoning from historical practice, cautioned that \"preservation of\n\nthe jury's historic role as a bulwark between the State and the\n\naccused at the trial for an alleged offense\" is the \"animating\n\nprinciple\" in which the Apprendi rule must remain rooted.                  Id. at\n\n717.    The Court expressly considered the history at common law of\n\nthe practice Ice challenged.              Finding that at the time of the\n\nFounding, it was judges who chose whether to impose sentences\n\nconcurrently or consecutively, and that therefore no traditional\n\njury function had been curtailed by Oregon's scheme, the Court\n\ndeclined to extend the Apprendi rule to this determination.13                  Id.\n\nat 717-18.         The logic and method of Ice alter any previous broad\n\nunderstanding of Apprendi.\n\n                 The prosecution argues that we should follow not only the\n\nmethod      of    historical   analysis    endorsed   by   Ice   but    also   the\n\nopinion's express language about criminal fines. The Court made an\n\n\n       13\n          The Court explained that its decision was also justified\nby states' sovereign interest in maintaining authority over their\ncriminal justice systems and by the administrative difficulties the\ncontrary rule, which could necessitate bifurcated or trifurcated\ntrials, would place on state court systems. Ice, 129 S. Ct. at\n718-19. The prosecution has provided a long list of state statutes\nthat impose fines per day of violation, urging this court to\nconsider the impact on state sovereignty that the application of\nApprendi to fines could have on these statutes. Because we find\nample reason not to extend the rule here, we need not decide the\nmerits of this argument.\n\n                                      -31-\n\fexpress statement in Ice, albeit in dicta, that it is inappropriate\n\nto extend Apprendi to criminal fines.                 Observing that many states\n\npermit judicial factfinding on matters \"other than the length of\n\nincarceration,\" the Court explained that \"[t]rial judges often find\n\nfacts about the nature of the offense or the character of the\n\ndefendant in determining, for example, the length of supervised\n\nrelease following service of a prison sentence; required attendance\n\nat drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service; and\n\nthe imposition of statutorily prescribed fines and orders of\n\nrestitution.\"14            Id. at 719.        The Court warned that applying\n\nApprendi to these types of determinations \"surely would cut the\n\nrule loose from its moorings.\"                Id.\n\n                We agree that we must give this language great weight.\n\nWe do not discount the Supreme Court's language merely because it\n\nwas used in dicta.          We \"are bound by the Supreme Court's considered\n\ndicta        almost   as   firmly   as   by    the   Court's   outright   holdings,\n\nparticularly when . . . a dictum is of recent vintage and not\n\n\n        14\n          We have previously held that orders of restitution are\nnot subject to the Apprendi rule. See United States v. Milkiewicz,\n470 F.3d 390 (1st Cir. 2006).       There, we explained that the\nstatutory scheme for restitution, under which the court determines\nthe victim's losses by a preponderance of the evidence, id. at 403,\ndoes not trigger the principles underlying Apprendi because the\njury's verdict of guilt automatically authorizes restitution in the\nfull amount of the victim's losses, id. at 404. We reached this\nresult despite noting that a \"literal application of the Supreme\nCourt's language might suggest\" that the Apprendi rule does apply,\nid. at 403, indicating that even before Ice the Supreme Court's\nApprendi line of cases tolerated nuanced application despite the\ncases' broad language.\n\n                                          -32-\n\fenfeebled by any subsequent statement.\"           Rossiter v. Potter, 357\n\nF.3d 26, 31 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nMcCoy v. MIT, 950 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation\n\nmark omitted).\n\n           Turning again to the method of reasoning the Court used\n\nin Ice, we agree with the prosecution that we must follow the logic\n\nof Ice's reasoning, which further supports the conclusion that\n\nApprendi does not apply to criminal fines.           As the Supreme Court\n\nrecently stated, \"[a] holding . . . can extend through its logic\n\nbeyond the specific facts of the particular case.\"            Los Angeles\n\nCounty v. Humphries, No. 09-350, slip op. at 8 (U.S. Nov. 30,\n\n2010).\n\n           Applying Ice's reasoning and logic to the issue in this\n\ncase, it is now highly relevant that, historically, judges assessed\n\nfines without input from the jury.15          Judges had discretion to\n\ndetermine the amount of any fine imposed, and \"[t]he range was\n\napparently without limit except insofar as it was within the\n\nexpectation on the part of the court that it would be paid.\"\n\nKathryn   Preyer,   Penal   Measures   in   the   American   Colonies:   An\n\nOverview, 26 Am. J. Legal Hist. 326, 350 (1982).        This is in direct\n\n\n\n     15\n          Before incarceration became widely used, \"the two main\nforms of noncapital punishment were whippings and fines, and in\nboth cases, the judge could set the amount or even elect between\nthe two, depending on the nature of the defendant and the crime.\"\nErik Lillquist, The Puzzling Return of Jury Sentencing: Misgivings\nabout Apprendi, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 621, 641 (2004).\n\n                                  -33-\n\fcontrast with the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Apprendi context\n\nthat the \"English trial judge of the later eighteenth century had\n\nvery little explicit discretion in sentencing.\" Apprendi, 530 U.S.\n\nat 479 (quoting John H. Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury\n\non the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England,\n\nFrance, Germany 1700-1900, at 13, 36-37 (A. Schiappa ed., 1987)).\n\nJudicial discretion was limited in this context because the jury\n\ndecided what level of crime the defendant had committed, which in\n\nturn largely determined the sentence.               Id. at 479-80.\n\n               Southern    Union's   main    rejoinder    is    that   historical\n\npractices       do   not   speak     to    the     specific    issue   here,   the\n\ndetermination of the duration of an offense on which a fine is\n\ndetermined.16        Even assuming fines are similar to sentences of\n\nincarceration, this argument misses the point of the analogy and\n\nthe flow of the logic used by the Ice majority.                   The historical\n\nrecord presented in Ice showed that at common law, judges chose\n\nwithin their unfettered discretion whether to impose consecutive or\n\nconcurrent sentences, and consecutive sentences were the default\n\nrule.        Ice, 129 S. Ct. at 717.             The prosecution here presents\n\n\n\n        16\n          Southern Union also argues that there is evidence that\nten states allowed juries to determine fines at the turn of the\ntwentieth century. Such evidence, however, is of little utility\nwhere the inquiry concerns the role of the jury at common law. See\nIce, 129 S. Ct. at 717 (\"Our application of Apprendi's rule must\nhonor the 'longstanding common-law practice' in which the rule is\nrooted.\") (quoting Cunningham v. California, 549 U.S. 270, 281\n(2007)).\n\n                                          -34-\n\fstrong evidence of historic practice that at common law, judges'\n\ndiscretion in imposing fines was largely unfettered.               The Court in\n\nIce specifically cautioned that it would be senseless to use\n\nApprendi to nullify sentencing schemes in which legislatures have\n\ncurtailed the discretion judges had at common law.              Id. at 719.\n\n            Our    view   that   Ice    has    effected    a   change    in   the\n\napplication of the Apprendi rule to the issue in this case is\n\ndirectly supported by the dissent in Ice.                 The four dissenting\n\nJustices stated that the majority opinion had altered the method of\n\nanalysis underlying Apprendi in at least five different ways.                 Id.\n\nat 721-22 (Scalia, J., dissenting).               They protested that the\n\nmajority    had    constructed   formal       limits   narrowing   the    broad,\n\n\"nonformalistic rule\" originally set forth in Apprendi.                   Id. at\n\n720.      The dissent stated that the Ice majority had accepted\n\narguments the Court had previously rejected under Apprendi about\n\nthe    relevance     of   common-law      sentencing      practices      to   the\n\nconstitutionality of modern legislative sentencing schemes. Id. at\n\n720-22.    The dissent, colorfully accusing the majority of giving\n\nlife to arguments previously \"dead and buried,\" insisted that the\n\nCourt's opinion in Ice \"gives cause to doubt whether the Court is\n\nwilling to stand by\" the Apprendi rule.            Id. at 723.\n\n            Our holding is based on the Supreme Court's language in\n\nIce that \"[i]ntruding Apprendi's rule into\" decisions such as \"the\n\nimposition of statutorily prescribed fines . . . surely would cut\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fthe rule loose from its moorings.\"     Id. at 719 (majority opinion).\n\nTo the extent that excluding criminal fines from Apprendi requires\n\na more restrained view of the rule's scope than did the Court's\n\nprevious Apprendi-line decisions, it is the Supreme Court in Ice\n\nthat has imposed the restraint.      See id. (\"Members of this Court\n\nhave warned against 'wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the\n\nApprendi doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.'\") (quoting\n\nCunningham, 549 U.S. at 295 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)).17\n\n          In the interest of judicial economy and efficiency we\n\nreach an additional issue.    We hold that if we are wrong and if\n\nApprendi does apply to criminal fines, it would be necessary to\n\nremand for resentencing.     The district court erred in holding,\n\ndespite the absence of a special interrogatory, that the jury\n\nnecessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that Southern Union had\n\nviolated RCRA during all or nearly all of the date range in the\n\nindictment.   Southern Union II, 2009 WL 2032097, at *3.   The court\n\nreasoned that the indictment's description of the date range--from\n\n\n     17\n          We recognize that two circuits, which could not or did\nnot discuss Ice, have applied Apprendi to criminal fines.     See\nUnited States v. Pfaff, Nos. 09-1702, 09-1707, 09-1790, 2010 WL\n3365923 (2d Cir. Aug. 27, 2010); United States v. LaGrou\nDistribution Sys., Inc., 466 F.3d 585 (7th Cir. 2006). In LaGrou,\nwhich was decided before the Supreme Court's decision in Ice, the\nSeventh Circuit simply quoted the rule in Apprendi and held that\nthe fine imposed in that case violated the rule. LaGrou, 466 F.3d\nat 594.   In Pfaff, the Second Circuit cited to LaGrou without\nadding analysis of its own, other than to distinguish criminal\nfines from restitution on the stated grounds that only criminal\nfines are subject to statutory maximums. Pfaff, 2010 WL 3365923,\nat *2.\n\n                                -36-\n\f\"on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004\"--was \"listed\n\non the verdict form and found by the jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"    Id.    From this date range the court calculated a period of\n\nviolation of 762 days, resulting in a statutory maximum fine of\n\n$38.1 million, reduced a bit at the margin due to the \"on or about\"\n\nlanguage in the verdict form.            Id.\n\n            The prosecution essentially concedes and we agree that if\n\nApprendi did apply to criminal fines, the jury did not necessarily\n\ndetermine the number of days of violation.              The jury did not need\n\nto find that Southern Union began to violate RCRA \"on or about\"\n\nSeptember 19, 2002 in order to convict Southern Union on Count 1.\n\nAs   the   court    instructed     the    jury,   the   jury    needed     only    to\n\n\"determine . . . whether at some point in time the liquid mercury\n\nwas discarded by being abandoned\" and therefore ceased to be\n\nlegally held for future recycling and began to be stored as waste\n\n(emphasis added). Southern Union produced evidence that at several\n\npoints throughout the indictment period, and as late as the summer\n\nof 2004, Southern Union employees discussed a potential mercury\n\nrecycling project.        The district court could not conclude from the\n\nverdict    form    the    number   of    days   of   violation      the   jury    had\n\nnecessarily found.\n\n            Where    an    error   is     constitutional       in   nature,      \"the\n\ngovernment has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\"\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fUnited States v. Sepúlveda-Contreras, 466 F.3d 166, 171 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     Apprendi        error    is     harmless    \"where       the     evidence\n\noverwhelmingly establishes\" the facts necessary \"to justify the\n\nstatutory maximum under which the defendants were sentenced.\"\n\nUnited States v. Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 46 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThat is not this case. We reject the prosecution's suggestion that\n\nthe evidence was so overwhelming that no reasonable jury could\n\nconclude   other    than    that    the    mercury    was    treated      as    waste\n\nthroughout the period in the indictment.\n\n           If, then, we are wrong about whether the Apprendi rule\n\napplies to criminal fines, the case would need to be remanded to\n\nthe district court for resentencing. The district court would need\n\nto address several issues that we mention but do not resolve here.\n\n\n\n           First,    it    would    need    to    address    the    prosecution's\n\nargument at sentencing that even if Apprendi applied, Southern\n\nUnion could be assessed a $500,000 fine under the alternative fine\n\nstatute.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3571(c).\n\n           Second,    it    may    need    to    clarify    the    nature      of   the\n\nfinancial penalties it imposed.            At sentencing, after determining\n\nthat the statute \"yields a maximum fine . . . of $38.1 million,\"\n\nthe district court characterized the $18 million in financial\n\npenalties it imposed as two separate pools of funds, including a\n\n\"fine\" of $6 million and a \"community service obligation,\" listed\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\fin the court's judgment as a special condition of probation, of\n\n$12 million.18   In describing the community service obligation, the\n\ncourt did not use the term \"restitution,\" but neither did the court\n\nspecify that it was part of a total fine.\n\n          The prosecution argues that the district court should be\n\n\"permitted to clarify the status of the $12 million\" it assessed in\n\ncommunity service obligations as \"restitution.\"           Restitution is\n\nexempt from Apprendi under our circuit law.            United States v.\n\nMilkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 402-04 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Southern    Union,   in    its   opening   brief,   ignored   the\n\ndistrict court's treatment of the financial penalties as having two\n\nseparate components, and described its obligations as a single $18\n\nmillion penalty.    In its reply brief, it argues that the district\n\ncourt cannot recharacterize the community service obligations as\n\nrestitution because it did not invoke the statutory restitution\n\nprocedure before sentencing.        See 18 U.S.C. § 3664.     If a remand\n\nwere necessary, the district court may need to address these issues\n\n\n\n\n     18\n          $1 million of the $12 million obligation is designated\nfor the following recipients: $200,000 each for the Rhode Island\nChapter of the American Red Cross, the Rhode Island Environmental\nResponse Fund, the Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, the\nstate Distressed Communities Recreation and Acquisition Fund, and\nthe Pawtucket Fire Department.     The remaining $11 million is\ndesignated to endow a grantmaking fund, to be managed by the Rhode\nIsland Foundation, in order to fund grants in environmental\neducation, remediation, conservation, and children's health issues\nrelated to toxic waste.\n\n                                    -39-\n\fin the first instance and determine which arguments Southern Union\n\nhas preserved.\n\nB.            The Fine Imposed Was Reasonable\n\n              We review the reasonableness of the sentence imposed,\n\nupholding         the   sentence       unless    the   district   court    abused   its\n\ndiscretion.         United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesús, 589 F.3d 22, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 2009); United States v. Thurston, 544 F.3d 22, 24-25 (1st\n\nCir.    2008).          First,   we     determine      whether   the   district   court\n\nconsidered the relevant statutory sentencing factors and adequately\n\nexplained the sentence it chose.19 See United States v. Martin, 520\n\nF.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552\n\nU.S. 38, 51 (2007)).             Second, we consider whether the sentence is\n\nsubstantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances,\n\ngiving      due    deference      to    the     district   court's     experience   and\n\nfamiliarity with the facts of the case.                    Id.\n\n              The Sentencing Guidelines on fines do not apply here, and\n\nso in addition to the relevant RCRA provision, 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d),\n\nthe district court was obliged to consider only the sentencing\n\nfactors in 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553 and 3572.                      U.S.S.G. §§ 8C2.1 cmt.\n\nbackground, 8C2.10 (2009); see also United States v. Ionia Mgmt.\n\nS.A., 555 F.3d 303, 310-11 (2d Cir. 2009) (explaining review of\n\nfine imposed when Sentencing Guidelines do not apply).                              Even\n\n\n\n       19\n          Southern Union does not challenge the district court's\npertinent findings of fact.\n\n                                              -40-\n\fassuming arguendo that the $12 million community service obligation\n\nwas   a   fine,   the    financial   penalties       imposed    were      within   the\n\ndiscretion of the district court.\n\n              Southern Union argues that the district court misapplied\n\nthe statutory sentencing factors, placing too much emphasis on\n\nfactors    likely   to    increase   the     fine,    such     as   the    company's\n\nprofitability, and too little on mitigating factors, such as its\n\nprior history as a clean, responsible corporate citizen and its\n\noutlays in remediating the damage from the mercury distribution.\n\nThe prosecution urges us to review these claims only for plain\n\nerror,    because   Southern    Union    failed      to   present     them    to   the\n\ndistrict court despite clear opportunity to do so after the court\n\nannounced the sentence. See United States v. Almenas, 553 F.3d 27,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2009) (applying plain error review); United States v.\n\nMangual-Garcia, 505 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2007) (same).                        In any\n\nevent we hold there was no procedural error, let alone plain error,\n\nin the district court's methodical, detailed consideration of each\n\nsentencing factor.\n\n              Southern Union also claims the $18 million penalty was\n\nsubstantively unreasonable, arguing that it was grossly excessive\n\nin comparison to the penalties of $75,000-$250,000 imposed in what\n\nit describes as cases of more egregious RCRA violations.                      See 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   3553(a)(6)    (requiring     courts      to    \"avoid    unwarranted\n\nsentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fbeen found guilty of similar conduct\").               But the district court\n\nmade \"an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,\"\n\nand \"adequately explain[ed] the chosen sentence.\"             Gall, 552 U.S.\n\nat 50.\n\n             The district court explained why the statutory factors\n\njustified     the   penalties,   noting     that   Congress    measured   the\n\nseriousness of long-term RCRA violations by imposing a high, per-\n\nday statutory maximum fine; that Southern Union's willingness to\n\nput a densely-populated residential community, local public safety\n\nemployees, and its own employees at risk by storing hazardous waste\n\nunder     deplorable   conditions   in     their   midst    indicated   great\n\nculpability; and that there was a need for a penalty substantial\n\nenough to attract the attention of large corporations, thereby\n\nachieving     not   only   specific,     but   also    general,   deterrence.\n\nFurther, the district court specifically acknowledged the need to\n\navoid creating unwarranted disparities, but explained that it had\n\nconcluded that \"sentencing in criminal environmental matters is a\n\nvery individualistic task\" in which case-to-case comparisons are\n\ndifficult to make.20       Reviewing the totality of the circumstances,\n\n\n     20\n          Based on the five cases Southern Union encourages us to\nconsider, the court's conclusion was warranted. Four were resolved\nby plea agreements. The fifth, United States v. Kelley Technical\nCoatings, Inc., 157 F.3d 432 (6th Cir. 1998), upheld an RCRA\nconviction for which a $225,000 fine was imposed.      Id. at 444.\nKelley's sentence was not at issue on appeal, and the opinion lacks\ninformation necessary to any reasoned comparison--for instance,\nwhether Kelley's manufacturing plants were in a populated area, or\nhow large or profitable Kelley was. See id. at 435-36. Further,\n\n                                    -42-\n\fwe find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                IV.\n\n           In this case each side has been well represented by able\n\ncounsel.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm Southern Union's\n\nconviction as well as the sentence and financial penalties imposed.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nthe Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction of Kelley's vice\npresident and his sentence to a fine and imprisonment, id. at 443-\n44--a substantial penalty imposing individual responsibility that\nis completely absent in Southern Union's case since, as the\ndistrict court noted, there is no evidence of any individual\nshouldering any responsibility for the company's RCRA violation.\n\n                               -43-\n\f",

This appeal by Southern Union, a\n\nnatural gas company convicted by a jury of storing hazardous waste\n\nwithout a permit, raises two issues of initial impression.                 First,\n\nthe case tests whether federal criminal enforcement may be used\n\nunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6928(d), where certain federally approved state regulations as to\n\nhazardous waste storage have been violated.            Second, the case also\n\nraises the important question of whether a criminal fine must be\n\nvacated under Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), where a\n\njudge, and not a jury, determined the facts as to the number of\n\ndays of violation under a schedule of fines.\n\n           The hazardous waste at issue in this case is mercury,\n\nwhich can poison and kill those exposed to it.                 See 40 C.F.R.\n\n§   261.33(f)   tbl.    (listing   mercury    as   hazardous      waste    due   to\n\ntoxicity).      Here, 140 pounds of mercury became the play toy of\n\nyoung vandals who spread it about, including at their homes in a\n\nlocal apartment complex, after they spilled it around Southern\n\nUnion's   largely      abandoned   and    ill-guarded    Tidewater        site   in\n\nPawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\n           We    affirm   the   district     court's    rulings    on     Southern\n\nUnion's conviction, as set forth in United States v. Southern\n\nUnion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2577368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2577368/united-states-v-southern-union-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We\n\nconclude that:\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(1) Southern Union is precluded by 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b) from\n\nchallenging the EPA's 2002 Immediate Final Rule authorizing Rhode\n\nIsland's RCRA regulations.    Having failed to use the statutory\n\nprocedure for judicial review, Southern Union may not raise the\n\nissue by collateral attack;\n\n(2) the 2002 Rule, in any event, is valid and was within the EPA's\n\nauthority to adopt; and\n\n(3) the conviction does not violate Southern Union's right to fair\n\nnotice under the Due Process Clause.\n\n          We also affirm the fine imposed.   The Apprendi issue is\n\nclose but the Supreme Court's recent decision in Oregon v. Ice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145921\"><a href=\"/opinion/145921/oregon-v-ice/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), leads us to hold that the Apprendi rule does not\n\napply to the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines.       If,\n\nhowever, we were wrong in our assessment of the Apprendi issue, we\n\nwould find that any error under Apprendi was not harmless and that\n\nthe issue of the fine would need to be remanded.   Finally, we also\n\nhold that the financial penalties imposed did not constitute an\n\nabuse of the district court's discretion.\n\n         I. SOUTHERN UNION'S MERCURY STORAGE AND RELEASE\n\n          Southern Union, a Texas-based natural gas distributor,\n\nbegan supplying natural gas to Rhode Island and Massachusetts\n\ncustomers in 2000 through a subsidiary, New England Gas Company,\n\nthat it formed after acquiring several local gas companies.     It\n\nstopped serving Rhode Island customers in 2006.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f           As part of the transactions in 2000, Southern Union\n\nacquired a twelve-acre complex, once used as a gas manufacturing\n\nplant, on Tidewater Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Most of the\n\ncomplex sat unused, but Southern Union used a few buildings for\n\nautomated monitoring and used outdoor spaces to store construction\n\nsupplies and waste.\n\n           The Tidewater property was not maintained and had fallen\n\ninto disrepair.    The perimeter fence was rusted, with gaps that\n\nwere left unrepaired. There were no security cameras, and Southern\n\nUnion had removed the single part-time security guard from the site\n\nby September 2004.    Southern Union was aware that homeless people\n\nwere staying in a tin shed on the property, and that the property\n\nwas frequently vandalized.\n\n           In June 2001, Southern Union began removing outdated\n\nmercury-sealed gas regulators (MSRs) from customers' homes and\n\nreplacing them with updated regulators. The old MSRs were taken to\n\na brick building at the Tidewater facility.      There, for about five\n\nmonths,   an   environmental   firm   removed   the   mercury   from   the\n\nregulators and shipped it to a recycling facility, leaving the\n\nregulators to be cleaned and scrapped.          Southern Union stopped\n\nremoving MSRs as a matter of course in November 2001, and its\n\narrangement with the environmental firm ended in December 2001.\n\nHowever, Southern Union continued to remove MSRs whenever they\n\nmalfunctioned, bringing them to Tidewater, where they were \"stored\"\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fin doubled plastic bags placed in plastic kiddie pools on the floor\n\nof the brick building.\n\n              Employees were also encouraged to bring any loose mercury\n\nthey found in their departments to Tidewater, where it was placed\n\nin the same building as the gas regulators.              The loose mercury was\n\nstored in the various containers in which it arrived, including a\n\nmilk   jug,    a   paint   can,   glass   jars,    and   plastic   containers.\n\nSouthern Union kept the containers in a locked wooden cabinet that\n\nwas not designed for mercury storage.              The brick building was in\n\npoor condition and had suffered break-in attempts and vandalism.\n\nIt had many broken windows and its walls were covered in graffiti.\n\nNeither the cabinet nor the building itself contained any warning\n\nnotice that hazardous substances were inside.\n\n              Southern Union had no use for any of the mercury it\n\naccumulated.        By   July   2004,   when   a   Southern   Union   employee\n\ncatalogued the contents of the brick building, it held 165 MSRs and\n\napproximately 1.25 gallons, or more than 140 pounds, of loose\n\nmercury (two tablespoons of mercury weigh just under one pound).\n\nThat cataloguing did not lead the company to arrange for recycling,\n\nto secure the building, or to secure a storage permit from the\n\nstate.\n\n              Southern Union was well aware that the mercury was piling\n\nup and that it was kept in unsafe conditions.               The Environmental\n\nServices Manager for its New England Gas Company division, who\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftestified that he was concerned about the safety risk the mercury\n\nposed to the company's employees, drafted proposed Requests for\n\nProposals (RFPs) in 2002, 2003, and 2004 to solicit bids to remove\n\nand dispose of or recycle the regulators \"and associated wastes.\"\n\n            The    2002   draft    was    sent   to   Southern       Union's   Texas\n\ncorporate headquarters for review by the Director of Environmental\n\nServices, where it died.          Not only was the RFP not issued, but the\n\nNew England Gas Company engineer who oversaw the environmental\n\ndepartment became angry when he was repeatedly asked about it. The\n\n2003 proposed RFP met the same fate, even though it specified the\n\ncontents of a number of different containers of mercury.                        The\n\ndraft,    titled   \"Request       for    Proposals    for    Waste    Segregation,\n\nPackaging, Transportation, and Disposal,\" sought a bid to \"[r]emove\n\nliquid mercury from several small containers\" and \"[t]ransport and\n\ndispose (or recycle) of all waste generated\" by this work (emphasis\n\nadded).    Nor did anything come of the 2004 proposed RFP, even\n\nthough the environmental manager went outside his chain of command\n\ntrying to get the RFP issued to vendors.\n\n            The safety risk posed by the conditions under which the\n\nmercury was stored was discussed at joint employee-management\n\nsafety    committee   meetings      in    May,   June,      and   September    2004.\n\nIndeed, the employee who brought a regulator in on September 20,\n\n2004 was so concerned about the accumulating mercury that he raised\n\nthe issue with his supervisor.            No action was taken.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          In late September 2004, youths from a nearby apartment\n\ncomplex broke into the brick building, broke open the wooden\n\ncabinet, found the mercury, and, playing with it, spilled some of\n\nit in and around the building.   They also took some of the mercury\n\nback to their apartment complex, where they spilled more on the\n\nground, dipped cigarettes in it, and tossed some in the air.\n\nMercury was tracked into the residences when people walked through\n\nit and was found in several homes.\n\n          Southern Union discovered the break-in and spills on\n\nOctober 19, roughly three weeks later, when a worker found pancake-\n\nsized puddles of mercury around the brick building. Southern Union\n\nimmediately called in a contractor to begin cleaning up the spills\n\nat Tidewater and the apartment complex.\n\n          A Southern Union employee also left a voicemail message\n\nthat day for Jim Ball, the Emergency Response Coordinator at the\n\nstate Department of Environmental Management.    However, Southern\n\nUnion did not contact the Pawtucket Fire Department or the state\n\nFire Marshal, the designated points of contact for a release of\n\nmore than a pound of mercury.    The Fire Department did not arrive\n\nat Tidewater until the next day, after having found out about the\n\nspill from the Department of Environmental Management.     By that\n\ntime, the contractor had already removed the remaining mercury from\n\nthe building and begun to ship it offsite.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Altogether,    the    company   spent   more   than    $6   million\n\nremediating the two spill sites.           All five buildings in the\n\napartment complex were evacuated.         Residents, 150 of them, were\n\ndisplaced for two months.       Most were tested for mercury levels in\n\ntheir blood.   While some had elevated levels, none met current\n\nstandards for hazardous exposure.\n\n                II. CHALLENGES TO THE CONVICTION\n\n          In 2007, a federal grand jury returned a three-count\n\nindictment against Southern Union. The indictment charged Southern\n\nUnion with two counts of storing hazardous waste without a permit\n\nin violation of RCRA.    See 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(2)(A).         Count One of\n\nthe indictment covered the loose liquid mercury, and Count Three\n\ncovered the mercury-embedded gas regulators.             Count Two of the\n\nindictment charged Southern Union with failing to properly report\n\na mercury release of more than one pound, a violation of the\n\nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.1         See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 11004, 11045(b)(4).\n\n          Southern Union's prime defense at trial was that the\n\nmercury was not a waste, but rather was a commercial chemical\n\nproduct that the company intended to recycle.        Even if the mercury\n\nwas not a commercial chemical product, the Company argued, it had\n\nnot \"knowingly stored a hazardous waste\" because it believed the\n\nmercury was recyclable.        After a nearly four-week trial, a jury\n\n\n     1\n          Fifty-five plaintiffs filed related civil litigation.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fconvicted Southern Union on Count One only.          Southern Union I, 643\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 207.\n\n            Just before trial, Southern Union filed a motion arguing\n\nthat the federal government lacked authority to enforce Rhode\n\nIsland's regulations governing small quantity generators, under\n\nwhich Southern Union was prosecuted, because they were \"broader in\n\nscope\" than the federal RCRA program and therefore not part of the\n\nfederally approved and federally enforceable state program.              The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and Southern Union renewed it\n\nafter the jury verdict in a motion for a judgment of acquittal.2\n\n            The district court denied the motion for acquittal in a\n\npublished opinion issued July 22, 2009, finding Southern Union's\n\nchallenge     untimely   under   42   U.S.C.   §   6976(b),   which   governs\n\njudicial review of the EPA's authorization of state hazardous waste\n\nprograms.     Southern Union I, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 209-10.        The court\n\nhighlighted the statute's specific prohibition against judicial\n\nreview   of    such   authorizations    in     \"criminal   proceedings   for\n\nenforcement.\"    Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b)).        The court in the\n\nalternative rejected Southern Union's challenge on the merits,\n\nfinding that the authorization was a valid, binding legislative\n\nrule that authorized federal enforcement.           Id. at 210-13.\n\n\n\n     2\n          Southern Union also filed a Rule 33 motion for a new\ntrial.

Southern Union does not contest\n\nthis   proposition.          Rather,       it   argues     that   the    Rhode      Island\n\nregulations enforced here are not part of a federally authorized\n\nstate plan.\n\n           Under      §    6926,     the    EPA    has    promulgated         regulations\n\ngoverning federal approval of state programs, which provide that\n\nstates may adopt and enforce requirements that are \"more stringent\"\n\nor have a \"greater scope of coverage\" than the federal baseline\n\nprogram.   40 C.F.R. § 271.1(i).                However, for state programs with\n\n\"a greater scope of coverage,\" the \"additional coverage\" does not\n\nbecome   part    of   the     federally         approved    program.           40   C.F.R.\n\n§   271.1(i)(2).          Southern    Union      argues    that   the    Rhode      Island\n\nregulations applicable here provide additional coverage.\n\n           Rhode      Island       has     administered       its       own     federally\n\nauthorized hazardous waste program since 1986, and has secured\n\nfederal approval of amendments from time to time.                   See 67 Fed. Reg.\n\n51,765, 51,766 (Aug. 9, 2002).                    Pertinent here is the EPA's\n\nauthorization of further amendments to the state program on August\n\n9, 2002.        Id. at 51,765.           On that date, the EPA published an\n\n\"Immediate final rule\" (the \"2002 Rule\") in the Federal Register\n\nunder which the authorization would automatically go into effect on\n\nOctober 8, 2002, unless the EPA received a comment in opposition to\n\nthe authorization within thirty days.                Id. at 51,765, 51,766.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f           The 2002 Rule explained that the major difference between\n\nthe new Rhode Island program and the federal baseline program was\n\nthat Rhode Island now regulated conditionally exempt small quantity\n\ngenerators    (CESQGs)   more   stringently   than   did   the   federal\n\nregulations.3    Under the federal baseline program, CESQGs are\n\nexempt from many requirements--including the permit requirement--\n\nthat are imposed on generators of higher quantities of hazardous\n\nwaste.    40 C.F.R. §§ 261.5(a)(2) (outlining limited regulation of\n\nCESQGs), 270.1(c) (generally requiring permits to store hazardous\n\nwaste).\n\n           Relying on the federal conditional exemption, Southern\n\nUnion says it was a CESQG and therefore not required to have a\n\npermit.    But the 2002 Rule made two things clear.        One was that\n\nunder Rhode Island law, Southern Union needed a permit.             The\n\nsecond, tellingly, was that this tighter regulation was going to be\n\nfederally enforced.4\n\n\n     3\n          The   federal  program   categorizes  hazardous   waste\ngenerators by the amount of hazardous waste they produce monthly.\nA hazardous waste generator qualifies as a conditionally exempt\nsmall quantity generator (CESQG) for a given month if it produces\nless than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste in that month and has\naccumulated no more than 1000 kilograms on-site.       40 C.F.R.\n§ 261.5(a), (g)(2). In addition to complying with these limits,\nCESQGs must comply with regulations governing the categorization,\ntreatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes.       See 40 C.F.R.\n§§ 261.5(g)(1), (3); 262.11.\n     4\n          The Rule also made it clear that a different part of the\nregulation, not at issue here, would not be federally enforced,\nindicating EPA did not simply assume all additional state\nrequirements were federally enforceable.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          Southern Union did not comment; in fact, the EPA received\n\nno comments from the public.     Nor did Southern Union take any\n\naction to seek judicial review of the EPA's final determination.\n\nB.        Southern Union's Challenge\n\n          Southern Union argues that Rhode Island's regulation of\n\nCESQGs, under which it was prosecuted for storing loose mercury\n\nwithout a permit, cannot, merely by virtue of the 2002 Rule, be the\n\nbasis for federal criminal prosecution.   From this it argues that\n\nthe district court erred in refusing to put the question of whether\n\nit was a CESQG under federal law to the jury.   It argues that only\n\nthe part of a state's hazardous waste program that is \"required by\n\nfederal law\" becomes part of the state's federally authorized--and\n\ntherefore federally enforceable--program.   Southern Union has put\n\nthe cart before the horse.\n\n          1. Southern Union Is Precluded By 42 U.S.C. § 6976(b)\n          from Attacking Federal Criminal Enforcement of the\n          Federally Authorized State Rule\n\n          In enacting RCRA, Congress clearly channeled and limited\n\nthe mechanism for judicial review of EPA authorizations:\n\n     Review of the Administrator's action (1) in issuing,\n     denying, modifying, or revoking any permit under section\n     6925 of this title . . . or (2) in granting, denying, or\n     withdrawing authorization or interim authorization under\n     section 6926 of this title, may be had by any interested\n     person in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United\n     States for the Federal judicial district in which such\n     person   resides  or   transacts   such  business   upon\n     application by such person. Any such application shall\n     be made within ninety days from the date of such\n     issuance, denial, modification, revocation, grant, or\n     withdrawal, or after such date only if such application\n\n                               -13-\n\f       is based solely on grounds which arose after such\n       ninetieth day. Action of the Administrator with respect\n       to which review could have been obtained under this\n       subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in\n       civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.     Such\n       review shall be in accordance with sections 701 through\n       706 of Title 5.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 6976(b) (emphasis added).\n\n                  Two     of      the       statute's    mechanisms      are     involved     here.\n\nFirst, under § 6976(b), judicial review of the EPA Administrator's\n\nactions in granting authorization (or interim authorization) to\n\nstate programs under RCRA may be had in the pertinent federal court\n\nof appeals within ninety days of issuance of the authorization.\n\nSuch        review      is       to    be    in   accordance      with   the     Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. It is undisputed that Southern\n\nUnion failed to challenge the 2002 Rule in this manner.                                   Second,\n\nwhen review of the Administrator's actions could have been obtained\n\nunder        §    6976,          the    statute        denies     judicial     review    of     the\n\nAdministrator's              action          in   \"civil     or   criminal     proceedings      for\n\nenforcement.\"5\n\n                  This congressional channeling of the forum, method, and\n\ntiming of judicial review and exclusion of collateral attacks is\n\nnot         unusual.

That, it\nargues, is because the operative language was a mere \"preamble.\"\nIt then merges this into an attack on the merits of the regulation,\n\n                                        -16-\n\f            Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution we go on to\n\nexamine the legality of the EPA's actions and conclude in an\n\nalternate holding that those actions withstand challenge.\n\n            2. Southern Union's Attack on the Legality of the Federal\n            Authorization of Rhode Island's Regulation of CESQGs\n            Fails\n\n            Southern Union's arguments fall into several general\n\ncategories.      It argues (1) that the 2002 Rule is not a binding\n\nlegislative rule on its face for several reasons; (2) that the\n\nagency erred in its interpretation of the requirements in 40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 271.1(i), because the state rule provides a \"greater scope of\n\ncoverage\" and so cannot be within federal enforcement authority;\n\nand (3) that the 2002 Rule is invalid because it is inconsistent\n\nwith   prior    EPA   practice     and   that   inconsistency    has   not    been\n\nadequately explained or justified.\n\n            First, Southern Union challenges the authority under\n\nwhich the 2002 Rule was promulgated and the legal force of the\n\nRule's statement that Rhode Island's regulation of CESQGs is\n\nfederally      enforceable.   Southern      Union     claims,   without   citing\n\nauthority,     that   the   \"EPA    delegated    to    the   Regions   only    the\n\nresponsibility to authorize state RCRA programs under Section\n\n6926(b),\" not \"to determine or expand the breadth of federal\n\nenforcement authority.\"            But the EPA has a statutory duty to\n\n\n\narguing that it is not a \"binding\" or \"enforceable\" determination\nby the Administrator. We address this argument below.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fapprove state programs to the extent they meet the statutory and\n\nregulatory criteria. Southern Union does not explain how the EPA--\n\nincluding the regional administrators exercising their delegated\n\nauthorization     responsibilities--can     fulfill    that    duty   without\n\nspecifying which parts of a state's program fulfill the criteria,\n\nthereby becoming federally approved and enforceable.\n\n            Still pursuing its attack on the legal force of the 2002\n\nRule, Southern Union argues that the portion of the Rule that\n\ndiscusses federal enforceability is a mere unenforceable preamble.\n\nCf.

We    reject    this    strained      interpretation   of   40   C.F.R.\n\n§ 271.1(i), which governs federal authorization of state hazardous\n\nwaste programs.

Cir. 2006) (stating\n\nthat a substantive rule has the force and effect of law).\n\n               Southern   Union     offers     no   argument      that   the    EPA's\n\ninterpretation is arbitrary or capricious, or that the agency\n\nsomehow exceeded its statutory authority.              It argues only that its\n\nown reading is better on the plain language of the regulation.                     We\n\ndo not agree about the reading and in any event this is not enough.\n\nThe EPA's interpretation of 40 C.F.R. § 271.1(i) to permit federal\n\nenforcement of \"more stringent\" state regulations is a reasonable\n\none based on the text and structure of the regulation.11\n\n               Southern Union argues in the alternative that even if\n\n\"more stringent\" requirements are federally authorized, a state's\n\nregulation of CESQGs is \"additional coverage\" rather than merely a\n\n\n       11\n          Southern Union does not challenge the validity of 40\nC.F.R. § 271.1(i) itself (nor could it, since such a challenge\nwould be untimely under 42 U.S.C. § 6976(a)).\n\n                                        -21-\n\f\"more stringent\" requirement because it expands the universe of\n\nregulated entities to include entities that would not otherwise be\n\ncovered by RCRA.\n\n           Southern Union's argument is based on its misreading of\n\n40 C.F.R. § 261.5.      This federal regulation clearly regulates\n\nCESQGs, governing how they categorize their waste, where they may\n\nstore it, and how they may dispose of it.       40 C.F.R. § 261.5(c),\n\n(g).   This is in addition to the eligibility requirements for\n\ncategorization as a CESQG in a given month.     40 C.F.R. § 261.5(a),\n\n(g)(2). Further, because the eligibility requirements are based on\n\nthe amount of hazardous waste generated or stored in a particular\n\nmonth, CESQG status is transient, so that some generators will be\n\nCESQGs only some of the time.     It does not expand the universe of\n\nregulated entities to subject already-regulated entities to fuller\n\nregulation in Rhode Island.\n\n           Third, and finally, Southern Union strongly urges that\n\nthe 2002 Rule is invalid because it is irrationally inconsistent\n\nwith prior pronouncements of the EPA's position on the regulation\n\nof CESQGs and on which state regulations will receive federal\n\nauthorization.     Southern Union's argument relies primarily on\n\nvarious   nonbinding   EPA   guidance   documents   stemming   from   the\n\nagency's interpretations, in the 1980s, that state regulation of\n\nCESQGs was not federally enforceable.        However, these internal\n\nguidance documents have not been put forth as legally binding and\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwere not promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking, and\n\ntherefore        cannot    trump    the        agency's   formal   regulatory\n\npromulgations.

See 66 Fed. Reg. 46,961, 46,965 (Sept. 10, 2001)\n\n(District of Columbia); 57 Fed. Reg. 32,726, 32,729 (July 23, 1992)\n\n(California).      Southern Union argues the 2002 EPA Rule authorizing\n\nRhode Island's program cannot be binding on the regulated community\n\nbecause it is inconsistent with these prior determinations.\n\n            We briefly explain why the 2002 Rule is not subject to\n\nattack on grounds of irrational inconsistency with other EPA\n\nauthorizations of state programs.               The facts show that Southern\n\nUnion overstates the supposed conflict.             Since 1999, with the sole\n\nexception of the District of Columbia in 2001, EPA has consistently\n\ncharacterized state regulation of CESQGs as federally enforceable.\n\nSee 72 Fed. Reg. 12,568, 12,570 (Mar. 16, 2007) (Vermont); 71 Fed.\n\nReg. 9727, 9732, 9733 (Feb. 27, 2006) (New Hampshire); 69 Fed. Reg.\n\n57,842, 57,856 (Sept. 28, 2004) (Connecticut); 64 Fed. Reg. 48,099,\n\n48,101 (Sept. 2, 1999) (Louisiana).                The District of Columbia\n\ndecision in 2001 demonstrates, at worst, an aberration, and the\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fagency has maintained a consistent position ever since.

Ice, 129 S. Ct. at\n718-19. The prosecution has provided a long list of state statutes\nthat impose fines per day of violation, urging this court to\nconsider the impact on state sovereignty that the application of\nApprendi to fines could have on these statutes. Because we find\nample reason not to extend the rule here, we need not decide the\nmerits of this argument.\n\n                                      -31-\n\fexpress statement in Ice, albeit in dicta, that it is inappropriate\n\nto extend Apprendi to criminal fines.

The historical\n\nrecord presented in Ice showed that at common law, judges chose\n\nwithin their unfettered discretion whether to impose consecutive or\n\nconcurrent sentences, and consecutive sentences were the default\n\nrule.

Id. at 723.\n\n            Our holding is based on the Supreme Court's language in\n\nIce that \"[i]ntruding Apprendi's rule into\" decisions such as \"the\n\nimposition of statutorily prescribed fines . . . surely would cut\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fthe rule loose from its moorings.\"     Id. at 719 (majority opinion).\n\nTo the extent that excluding criminal fines from Apprendi requires\n\na more restrained view of the rule's scope than did the Court's\n\nprevious Apprendi-line decisions, it is the Supreme Court in Ice\n\nthat has imposed the restraint.      See id. (\"Members of this Court\n\nhave warned against 'wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the\n\nApprendi doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.'\") (quoting\n\nCunningham, 549 U.S. at 295 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)).17\n\n          In the interest of judicial economy and efficiency we\n\nreach an additional issue.    We hold that if we are wrong and if\n\nApprendi does apply to criminal fines, it would be necessary to\n\nremand for resentencing.     The district court erred in holding,\n\ndespite the absence of a special interrogatory, that the jury\n\nnecessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that Southern Union had\n\nviolated RCRA during all or nearly all of the date range in the\n\nindictment.

From this date range the court calculated a period of\n\nviolation of 762 days, resulting in a statutory maximum fine of\n\n$38.1 million, reduced a bit at the margin due to the \"on or about\"\n\nlanguage in the verdict form.            Id.\n\n            The prosecution essentially concedes and we agree that if\n\nApprendi did apply to criminal fines, the jury did not necessarily\n\ndetermine the number of days of violation.              The jury did not need\n\nto find that Southern Union began to violate RCRA \"on or about\"\n\nSeptember 19, 2002 in order to convict Southern Union on Count 1.\n\nAs   the   court    instructed     the    jury,   the   jury    needed     only    to\n\n\"determine . . . whether at some point in time the liquid mercury\n\nwas discarded by being abandoned\" and therefore ceased to be\n\nlegally held for future recycling and began to be stored as waste\n\n(emphasis added). Southern Union produced evidence that at several\n\npoints throughout the indictment period, and as late as the summer\n\nof 2004, Southern Union employees discussed a potential mercury\n\nrecycling project.        The district court could not conclude from the\n\nverdict    form    the    number   of    days   of   violation      the   jury    had\n\nnecessarily found.\n\n            Where    an    error   is     constitutional       in   nature,      \"the\n\ngovernment has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\"\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fUnited States v.

We reject the prosecution's suggestion that\n\nthe evidence was so overwhelming that no reasonable jury could\n\nconclude   other    than    that    the    mercury    was    treated      as    waste\n\nthroughout the period in the indictment.\n\n           If, then, we are wrong about whether the Apprendi rule\n\napplies to criminal fines, the case would need to be remanded to\n\nthe district court for resentencing. The district court would need\n\nto address several issues that we mention but do not resolve here.\n\n\n\n           First,    it    would    need    to    address    the    prosecution's\n\nargument at sentencing that even if Apprendi applied, Southern\n\nUnion could be assessed a $500,000 fine under the alternative fine\n\nstatute.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3571(c).\n\n           Second,    it    may    need    to    clarify    the    nature      of   the\n\nfinancial penalties it imposed.            At sentencing, after determining\n\nthat the statute \"yields a maximum fine . . . of $38.1 million,\"\n\nthe district court characterized the $18 million in financial\n\npenalties it imposed as two separate pools of funds, including a\n\n\"fine\" of $6 million and a \"community service obligation,\" listed\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\fin the court's judgment as a special condition of probation, of\n\n$12 million.18   In describing the community service obligation, the\n\ncourt did not use the term \"restitution,\" but neither did the court\n\nspecify that it was part of a total fine.\n\n          The prosecution argues that the district court should be\n\n\"permitted to clarify the status of the $12 million\" it assessed in\n\ncommunity service obligations as \"restitution.\"           Restitution is\n\nexempt from Apprendi under our circuit law.

In its reply brief, it argues that the district\n\ncourt cannot recharacterize the community service obligations as\n\nrestitution because it did not invoke the statutory restitution\n\nprocedure before sentencing.        See 18 U.S.C. § 3664.
