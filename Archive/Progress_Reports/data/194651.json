This case  was brought by Robert\n                          \n\nCameron,  who  is  currently  detained  in the  Massachusetts\n\nTreatment Center  for the Sexually  Dangerous (\"the Treatment\n\nCenter\").  The defendants,  whom we refer to as  \"the state,\"\n\nare officials  who are responsible for  the Treatment Center.\n\nIn  substance,  Cameron  complains  that  his  conditions  of\n\nconfinement violate the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment  and   his   asserted  constitutional   \"right   to\n\ntreatment.\"  \n\n     After  a   bench  trial  the   district  court   granted\n\ninjunctive  relief and  the state  appealed.   We  modify the\n\ninjunction in accordance with  this opinion and, with certain\n\nclarifications, otherwise  affirm most of the  relief ordered\n\nby  the district  court.   Our  decision  is based  upon  the\n\ndistrict court's findings  but rests upon somewhat  different\n\nlegal grounds.\n\n             I.  THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n\n     On December  13, 1978, Cameron was  convicted in Vermont\n\nof  aggravated  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon  and  sexual\n\nassault--apparently  attempted rape--and sentenced  to a term\n\nof   six  to  twenty  years.    He  was  then  extradited  to\n\nMassachusetts  and  convicted  on  September  12,  1979,  for\n\nassault with  intent to  rape, kidnapping, and  other crimes,\n\nand  sentenced to a term  of ten to  twenty years, commencing\n\nafter the Vermont sentence.   On being paroled by  Vermont on\n\n                             -2-\n\nJuly  12,  1982,  Cameron  began  serving  his  Massachusetts\n\nsentence, which at the time of trial was set to expire in the\n\nyear 2002.1\n\n     After serving several  years in a  Massachusetts prison,\n\nCameron   on  November   14,  1985,   was  adjudged   by  the\n\nMassachusetts  Superior  Court  to be  a  sexually  dangerous\n\nperson  under M.G.L. c. 123A,  and committed to the Treatment\n\nCenter for a period of one day to life.  The occasion for the\n\ncommitment is  not described.   The Treatment Center,  one of\n\nseveral  facilities   located  at  MCI   Bridgewater,  has  a\n\ncheckered history, much of  it embroiled in litigation, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nLangton  v. Johnston,  928  F.2d 1206  (1st  Cir. 1991),  and\n                    \n\nM.G.L. c.  123A itself has an uncertain future.2  Most of the\n\nTreatment  Center's  inhabitants  have   underlying  criminal\n\nconvictions,   and   it  is   administered  jointly   by  the\n\nDepartments of Mental Health  and Corrections to address both\n\nthe  medical and security aims of the Center.  Cameron's stay\n\n                    \n\n     1The   district   court   opinion   recites   that   the\nMassachusetts  sentence  ended  in  February  1992;  but  the\nparties  advise us that Cameron's release date at the time of\ntrial was 2002.  Cameron's brief says that this period may be\nshortened by good time credits and possible parole.\n\n     2The statute  is one of the  so-called sexual psychopath\nlaws enacted  in the 1940s  in a  number of states.   See  C.\n                                                         \nTenney, Sex, Sanity and Stupidity in Massachusetts, 42 B.U.L.\n                                                  \nRev.  1  (1962).    In 1990,  the  Massachusetts  legislature\ncurtailed  new admissions  into  the Treatment  Center.   See\n                                                             \nLangton, 928 F.2d at 1209.\n       \n\n                             -3-\n\nat  the  Treatment  Center appears  to  have  been even  more\n\nunhappy than normal.\n\n     Although the  parties agree  on little else,  it appears\n\nthat  Cameron who  is  50 years  old  and a  Vietnam  veteran\n\nsuffers from severe psychological disorders.  In the words of\n\nthe  district court,  \"Cameron suffers  from a  borderline or\n\nmixed   personality   disorder   and  post-traumatic   stress\n\ndisorder.  There is also no dispute that as a result . . . he\n\nmay  often act  in  a paranoid  and confrontational  manner.\"\n\nCameron  v. Tomes, 783 F.  Supp. 1511, 1517  (D. Mass. 1992).\n                 \n\nPsychological treatment is available at the Treatment Center-\n\n-indeed,  its availability  is provided  for under  a consent\n\njudgment entered many years  ago3--but Cameron found what was\n\noffered unsuitable  until 1989 when he  established a working\n\nrelationship with a therapist.\n\n     In  the meantime,  Cameron brought  the present  suit in\n\n1986 challenging his conditions  of confinement.  Counsel was\n\nassigned,  his  claims  evolved,  and in  December  1991  and\n\nJanuary 1992,  the district  court conducted a  six-day bench\n\ntrial  in the case.   In his  opinion issued  on February 14,\n\n1992,  the  district  judge   declared  that  Cameron  had  a\n\n                    \n\n     3Regulations adopted pursuant to the decree provide that\n\"[e]very  patient shall  be offered  treatment to  effect his\nearly return to public society.  Such treatment shall consist\nof  medical, psychiatric  [and other  services] .  . .   Such\ntreatment   shall  be  administered  .  .   .  in  the  least\nrestrictive   conditions  which  are   consistent  with  [the\npatient's] security needs.\"  Langton, 928 F.2d at 1211.\n                                    \n\n                             -4-\n\n\"constitutional  right to  minimally adequate  treatment [for\n\nhis mental disorders] based upon the exercise of professional\n\njudgment.\"   783  F. Supp.  at 1516.   The  court rejected  a\n\nmotion to dismiss by the state, which had argued that no such\n\nconstitutional  right existed.   Id.   It  also rejected  the\n                                   \n\nstate's res  judicata defense, id.  at 1516-17, based  on the\n                                 \n\nLangton case where  a different district judge had found that\n       \n\nthe  Treatment  Center was  in  general  compliance with  the\n\nconsent decree.  See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1208-16.\n                            \n\n     The  district  court then  ruled  that, on  a  number of\n\nissues,  those in  charge of  the  Treatment Center  had made\n\njudgments  about Cameron  and enforced  policies  against him\n\nwithout,  or   contrary  to,   the  advice  of   the  medical\n\nprofessionals involved  in his  treatment.   783 F.  Supp. at\n\n1518-25.  The district  court made specific findings relating\n\nto  Cameron's  access to  outside  medical care,  the  use of\n\nshackles and an armed guard in transporting  him, his housing\n\nin  the  facility,  physical  searches of  him,  and  similar\n\nmatters.  The  court then  granted injunctive  relief on  ten\n\ndifferent matters.  Id. at 1526-27.\n                      \n\n     First, and most broadly, the court ordered the pertinent\n\nadministrative board within  the Treatment Center to  conduct\n\nan immediate  review  of his  current  sexual  dangerousness,\n\nappropriate  treatment and  conditions,  and his  request  to\n\nparticipate in  what is called the  community access program.\n\n                             -5-\n\n783 F. Supp.  at 1526.   This injunctive  provision ended  by\n\nstating:    \"All  final  decisions  on   Cameron's  long-term\n\ntreatment,  including  his  participation  in  the  community\n\naccess program, must be made by a qualified professional,  or\n\nwith due respect and  regard for the judgment of  a qualified\n\nprofessional.\"  Id.\n                  \n\n     Several other decree provisions are similarly qualified.\n\nThe court suspended the use of shackles and an armed guard in\n\ntransporting Cameron  for  outside medical  care  unless  and\n\nuntil  \"a qualified  decision  maker determines  through  the\n\nexercise  of professional  judgment that such  restraints are\n\nprofessionally  acceptable,  based  on  a  weighing  of  [the\n\nstate's] needs along with Cameron's treatment needs.\"  783 F.\n\nSupp. at 1526.   Prohibited, under a  similar condition, were\n\nsubjecting Cameron to a restrictive internal movement policy,\n\nto  an intrusive  search  procedure previously  used and  so-\n\ncalled   \"oral  cavity   searches,\"   and  to   the  \"current\n\ndisciplinary system\" of the  Treatment Center.  Id. at  1526-\n                                                  \n\n27.\n\n     Finally,  without any  qualification as  to professional\n\njudgment, the  court ordered that Cameron  be allowed medical\n\ntreatment  at Veterans Administration facilities for specific\n\nmedical conditions, that he be allowed housing in the maximum\n\nprivilege unit of the  Treatment Center without consenting to\n\nshare  a  room, and  that  a handicapped  accessible  room be\n\n                             -6-\n\nimmediately made available  to him.   783 F.  Supp. at  1526.\n\nThis  last direction, as well  as several of  the others, was\n\nrelated  to   physical  disabilities  suffered   by  Cameron,\n\nincluding the  amputation of  a  leg due  to infection  while\n\nCameron was in the care of the state.  \n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Res Judicata.   The  state's threshold objection  to the\n                 \n\nsuit  is  that  Cameron's  claims are  encompassed  by  prior\n\nlitigation   and  are  therefore   barred  as  res  judicata.\n                                                            \n\nEmphasizing the  \"claim preclusion\" branch  of res  judicata,\n                                                            \n\nthe  state's brief says that one of the consolidated district\n\ncourt cases  embraced by  Langton--Bruder v. Johnston--was  a\n                                                     \n\nclass action  suit concerning the right to  treatment for all\n\npersons  confined  at  the   Treatment  Center  as  of  1987.\n\nCameron, says the  state, was a  member of the class  and the\n\nstate prevailed in that case on the ground that treatment was\n\nadequately provided.\n\n     We agree with the district court that the state has made\n\nno showing that  Cameron's claim is  barred by res  judicata.\n                                                            \n\nCases on res judicata, ample in many areas, are fairly sparse\n                     \n\nwhere preclusion  of distinctive  individual claims  is urged\n\nbased upon an earlier  class action judgment.  But  in Cooper\n                                                             \n\nv. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 880 (1984), the\n                                   \n\nSupreme Court  confirmed what  common sense would  suggest: a\n\nclass action judgment--there, in a discrimination case--binds\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe class members as  to matters actually litigated  but does\n\nnot resolve any claim  based on individual circumstances that\n\nwas not addressed in the class action.  Id. at 880-82.\n                                          \n\n     Under Cooper,  we think  that res judicata  plainly does\n                                               \n\nnot apply in  this instance.  The several law suits and years\n\nof proceedings embraced by Langton require pages to describe,\n                                  \n\nbut  the  suits were  concerned  with  fairly general  issues\n\n(e.g., physical plant, sequestration, equality  of treatment)\n    \n\nand with specific claims  of individuals other than Cameron.4\n\nThe  closest that that litigation  came to this  case was (1)\n\nendorsement of  a general requirement of  treatment set forth\n\nin  state regulations,  (2) rejection  of a  charge that  the\n\nauthorized  absence  program   was  underutilized,  and   (3)\n\nrejection  of  a  general  attack  on  the  \"double  bunking\"\n\nrequirement.   These claims dealt with  the general condition\n\nof  inhabitants  of the  Treatment  Center.   If  Langton has\n                                                         \n\nanything else in  common with  this case, the  state has  not\n\nmentioned it.\n\n     This  case, by  contrast, rests  primarily  on Cameron's\n\nclaims   that   his   unusual   situation   requires  special\n\naccommodations:   specifically, that his  physical disability\n\naffects his  need for outside medical  visits, freer movement\n\n                    \n\n     4A  detailed history  of the  litigation and  the issues\ndecided is  contained in the thorough,  171-page, unpublished\ndecision  of  Judge  Mazzone,  which this  court  in  Langton\n                                                             \naffirmed on all issues apart from attorney's fees.\n\n                             -8-\n\nwithin   the   Treatment   Center,   and   separate   bunking\n\narrangements  adapted to  his handicap,  and that  his mental\n\ncondition  (what lay  people  would probably  call  paranoia)\n\nmakes ordinary physical  searches, disciplinary  arrangements\n\nand  other  constraints  unsuitable,  indeed  psychologically\n\ndangerous, for him.  There is no suggestion by the state that\n\nthese issues  peculiar to Cameron were  actually litigated in\n\nthe Langton case.\n           \n\n     Thus, the  state's claim reduces itself  to the argument\n\nthat  Cameron  had to  litigate those  issues in  the earlier\n                  \n\ncases or forever  hold his peace.  To describe  this claim is\n\nto refute  it:   class action institutional  litigation often\n\naddresses general circumstances,  not the distinctive  plight\n\nof someone claiming special  needs or status.  To  the extent\n\nindividual concerns were addressed in Langton, Cameron is not\n                                             \n\neven mentioned  in the  district court  decision.  Nor  could\n\nearlier  cases deal with  later occurring  events that  are a\n                               \n\npart of  Cameron's present case.  In theory, claim preclusion\n\nis  possible   where  an   earlier  class  action   claim  is\n\nessentially the same as a later action for individual relief,\n\nand issue preclusion is possible where a fact resolved in the\n\nclass  action  proves important  in  the later  action.   See\n                                                             \n\nCooper,  467 U.S. at 880-82.   No such overlap has been shown\n      \n\nhere.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     The Merits.   The district court  in this case  premised\n               \n\nits  decision  on  what  it  deemed  to  be  two  established\n\nconstitutional  rights possessed  by  those at  the Treatment\n\nCenter:  \"a  constitutional   right  to  minimally   adequate\n\ntreatment [for  mental disorders] based upon  the exercise of\n\nprofessional  judgment,\" 783 F. Supp. at 1516, and a right to\n\nbe free from  \"[b]odily restraints\" except  \"when and to  the\n\nextent  professional judgment deems  this necessary .  . . .\"\n\nId. at 1520.   It  is not entirely  clear whose  professional\n  \n\njudgment--medical or administrative--the  district court  had\n\nin  mind; but the implication  of its discussion  is that the\n\nadministrators of  the facility  are bound  to listen  to the\n\njudgment of  the medical professionals and to  heed it unless\n\nthey offer good reason for  refusing to do so.  Id.  at 1519-\n                                                  \n\n20.  \n\n     Both  sides  on this  appeal  seek  a  decision  on  the\n\nconstitutional \"right  to treatment,\" the  state urging  that\n\nnone exists  and Cameron supporting  the district court.   In\n\nour view, a  decision on  the abstract issue  of \"a right  to\n\ntreatment\" is not  necessary for a disposition of  this case;\n\nand  the concept has only  a remote connection  to the actual\n\nrelief sought.   We address this  point briefly, against  the\n\nbackground   of  prior  \"right   to  treatment\"  law,  before\n\nconsidering Cameron's own situation and the proper touchstone\n\nfor appraising his claims.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     It  is settled that those who are confined by the state,\n\nfor whatever  reason, are entitled under  the Constitution to\n\nfood,  clothing,  medical  care,  and  reasonable  efforts to\n\nsecure  physical  safety.   Beyond  such obvious  essentials,\n\nhowever, guidance from the  Supreme Court is largely confined\n\nto  one cautiously phrased decision.   In Youngberg v.

Then,\n\ndiscovering  that he was  sometimes physically  restrained by\n\n\"soft\"  shackles  and  taught  little  in  \"basic   self-care\n\nskills,\" she sued.   The Supreme Court held that  under those\n\ncircumstances the child was  constitutionally entitled to  be\n\nfree from any  but necessary  restraints and had  a right  to\n\nbasic self-care training  to secure safety and  mobility.  As\n\nfor  deciding when and how  much, the Court  said that judges\n\nshould  not dictate the  choice among acceptable alternatives\n\nand that a \"presumption\" of  correctness must be attached  to\n\n\"professional judgment.\"  Id. at 321-23.\n                            \n\n     Youngberg  left  in limbo  a prior  line of  lower court\n              \n\ncases  and academic  literature that  had  sought to  shape a\n\nbroad   constitutional   \"right   to  treatment,\"   including\n\ntreatment  of  the psychological  ills of  confined persons.5\n\n                    \n\n     5See Stefan, Leaving Civil Rights to the \"Experts\": From\n                                                             \nDeference  to  Abdication  Under  the  Professional  Judgment\n                                                             \nStandard, 102  Yale L.J. 639,  686-90 (1992).

Gaughan, 808 F.2d  871 (1st Cir. 1986), this  court, under\n          \n\nthe caption  \"constitutional right to treatment,\" agreed that\n\nYoungberg  extended beyond  the retarded  to protect  similar\n         \n\ninterests of those mentally  ill persons civilly committed to\n\na different Bridgewater facility.

One reason why  it was unnecessary in  Langton was\n                                                         \n\nthat  the consent  decree  \"set a  higher  standard than  the\n\n                    \n\ndeclined  to  devise  any  general   rights  to  ameliorative\nprograms beyond basic self-help training to assure safety and\nmobility, saying \"we  need go no further in this  case.\"  457\nU.S. at 319.   \n\n     6Compare, e.g., Ohlinger v.

Id.7  \n                     \n\n     Although the parties seek to litigate the abstract issue\n\nof a right to treatment, we prefer to plow a  furrow no wider\n\nthan  the case demands.   Cameron's claims for  the most part\n\nare  not really  \"right to  treatment\" claims  at all:  he is\n\nreceiving   substantial   psychological  treatment   for  his\n\ncondition,  and most of  the arguments  he is  making concern\n\nhousing,  mobility, transportation,  and security.   Further,\n\nunder existing state law, there is already a regulation-based\n\nright to  treatment at  the Treatment Center  that equals  or\n\nexceeds anything  that the Supreme Court  would likely impose\n\nunder the Due Process Clause.  See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1217.\n                                          \n\nIt  is also unclear whether, if the Supreme Court did provide\n\na general \"right to treatment\" for civilly committed persons,\n\nit  would  apply  that right  to  those  held  as well  under\n\ncriminal sentence.  Youngberg,  457 U.S. at 321-22.8   At the\n                             \n\n                    \n\n     7In Cortes-Quinones v.  Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556\n                                               \n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 823 (1988), and Torraco v.\n                                                          \nMaloney, 923 F.2d 231  (1st Cir. 1991), this  court addressed\n       \nclaims that authorities had  not taken the precaution against\nsuicide of individual prisoners.   While both decisions spoke\nof  the state's obligation to  provide for medical needs, the\ncontext was  very far removed  from any generalized  right to\ntreatment for psychological conditions.\n\n     8Whatever other significance it  may have, we think that\nCameron's criminal sentence does refute  any claim that he is\nentitled under the Constitution to minimum physical restraint\nbased on the judgment of his doctors.  Quite unlike the child\nin  Youngberg,   Cameron  is  under   criminal  sentence   of\n             \nimprisonment for serious and violent crimes.  To that extent,\n\n                             -13-\n\nvery least, the Court's approach in Youngberg suggests hewing\n                                             \n\nto the case-by-case approach.\n\n     Taking that  approach here, we think  the touchstone for\n\nCameron's claims is the Due Process Clause of the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, requiring  conditions that  do not fall  below the\n\nminimum standards of civilized decency.  See generally Rochin\n                                                             \n\nv.  California,  342 U.S.  165  (1952).   Under  this rubric,\n              \n\ncontext works in Cameron's favor.  While  his prison sentence\n\nwill expire in 2002  or even earlier, his confinement  in the\n\nTreatment Center is from  one day to life and  will never end\n\nunless his condition improves and he is found to be no longer\n\nsexually dangerous.   Thus,  Cameron's best argument  is that\n\nthe   state's   ordinary  procedures   and   constraints  are\n\naffirmatively and needlessly worsening his  mental condition,\n                                      \n\nso that  he may well be confined  long after his sentence has\n\nexpired.  This is a claim with some bite, no  matter how much\n\nlatitude states ordinarily have to run their institutions.\n\n     Further, the  findings  of  the  district  court,  which\n\ncontrol unless clearly erroneous, Fed. R.  Civ. P. 52(a); Doe\n                                                             \n\nv.  Gaughan,  808 F.2d  at  877,  lend  support to  Cameron's\n           \n\nargument.   The  findings amount  to a  determination by  the\n\ndistrict  court  that  procedures  that might  ordinarily  be\n\napplied--such  as certain  of the  searches and  the internal\n\n                    \n\nhe  lacks  the  same  \"liberty\"  interest  as  the  child  in\nYoungberg.\n         \n\n                             -14-\n\nmovement controls--worsen Cameron's condition and may well be\n                                                 \n\nunnecessary in  this case.  See 783 F. Supp. at 1523-25.9  On\n                               \n\nboth points,  effect and  necessity, the district  court says\n\nthat this is  the judgment of  the medical professionals  and\n\nthat  no  adequate  response   has  been  obtained  from  the\n\nadministrators.  Id.\n                   \n\n     The  state  broadly  disputes this  version  of  events,\n\npointing  to other evidence  showing how  much it  has helped\n\nCameron  and tried to accommodate his special needs.  It does\n\nnot, however, make much effort in its brief to rebut specific\n\nfindings as to  specific episodes.   We think  there is  some\n\nconflict in the  evidence but also that  the district judge's\n\nfindings  are not clearly erroneous.   It is  true that these\n\nfindings  were made in the framework of a legal analysis that\n\nwe do not adopt, but the  findings fit well enough into a due\n\nprocess framework and  this court may  affirm on any  grounds\n\nsupported by evidence.   See Doe  v. Anrig,  728 F.2d 30,  32\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1984).\n\n                    \n\n     9For  example,   the  court  invoked  the  testimony  of\nCameron's  therapist  that  the  shackling  was  \"harmful  to\nCameron's mental  health\" and the court  found it unnecessary\nbased on  \"uncontroverted evidence.\"   783 F. Supp.  at 1520.\nThe  court determined  that the  Treatment Center's  internal\nmovement policy,  allowing free movement for  only 10 minutes\neach hour, was unworkable for Cameron as an amputee, creating\n\"undue pressure [that] . . . compromises his treatment.\"  Id.\n                                                            \nat  1522.   A  forcible search  of Cameron  while handcuffed,\nwhich  the court found may well  have been unnecessary, drove\nCameron  into  moods  of  \"helplessness,  anger,  despair and\nhopelessness . . . .\"  Id. at 1523.\n                         \n\n                             -15-\n\n     Relief  Ordered by  the District  Court.   The immediate\n                                            \n\nrelief  ordered by  the district  court is,  with one  or two\n\nexceptions,  fairly  modest,   primarily  requiring   further\n\nconsideration  of Cameron's  case and some  interim measures.\n\nImportantly, the  court has ordered a  general reappraisal of\n\nCameron's treatment and conditions, with decisions to be made\n\nby the administrators  \"with due respect  and regard for  the\n\njudgment of a qualified professional.\"  783 F. Supp. at 1526.\n\nBut given the district court's use in several contexts of the\n\n\"professional judgment\" standard, a word is  in order for the\n\nguidance  of the parties  and for any  future litigation that\n\nmay ensue.\n\n     In an institution  like the Treatment  Center, as in  an\n\nordinary prison,  security  and administrative  concerns  may\n\nclash with  the welfare and  comfort of  individuals, as  the\n\ndistrict  court recognized.  This  was so in  the facility at\n\nissue in Youngberg, 457 U.S.  at 320, and it is surely  so in\n                  \n\nthe  Treatment Center  where most  if not all  those detained\n\nhave been convicted of crimes and many may be dangerous.  Any\n\nprofessional   judgment  that  decides   an  issue  involving\n                                      \n\nconditions   of  confinement   must   embrace  security   and\n\nadministration, and not merely medical judgments.\n\n     Thus when  it comes to  appraising the judgments  of the\n\nadministrators,  it does not follow that they are bound to do\n\nwhat the doctors say is best  for Cameron even if the doctors\n\n                             -16-\n\nare  unanimous.   The administrators  are responsible  to the\n\nstate  and to the public for making professional judgments of\n\ntheir  own, encompassing  institutional  concerns as  well as\n\nindividual welfare.  Nothing in the Constitution mechanically\n\ngives  controlling   weight  to   one  set  of   professional\n\njudgments.   Indeed, when it comes  to constitutional rights,\n\nnone of the  professionals has the  last word.   Professional\n\njudgment, as the Supreme Court has explained,  creates only a\n\n\"presumption\"  of  correctness;  welcome  or  not, the  final\n\nresponsibility  belongs to  the courts.   See  Youngberg, 457\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 323.\n\n     With this clarification as  to the role of \"professional\n\njudgment,\" we  sustain the first injunctive  relief provision\n\nordered  by  the  district   court    directing  the  general\n\nreappraisal of Cameron's  personal dangerousness  and of  his\n\ngeneral  conditions of confinement.  Para. 1 (783 F. Supp. at\n\n1526).  The findings noted  above and the evidence  portrayed\n\nin the  district court's decision support  this fairly modest\n\ndirective.  In framing equitable relief, a district court has\n\nsubstantial  latitude,  and  we  think its  \"remand\"  to  the\n\nTreatment Center administration is well within its authority.\n\n     We  also conclude that, on  the same basis  and with the\n\nsame clarification  as to the role  of professional judgment,\n\nthe  district court's findings, see 783  F. Supp. at 1522-24,\n                                   \n\nsupport  several other  conditioned decree provisions:   that\n\n                             -17-\n\nadministrators  consider  requests by  Cameron  for treatment\n\noutside the Treatment Center, para. 4 (id. at 1526); that the\n                                         \n\nten-minute movement  restriction and oral-cavity  searches be\n\nsuspended  as  to  Cameron   unless  and  until  a  qualified\n\ndecision-maker  concludes  that  they  are   appropriate  for\n\nCameron; and  that the \"Extraction Team\"  searches of Cameron\n\nbe barred unless there is prior consultation with a Treatment\n\nCenter clinician.  Paras. 5, 6 and 8 (id. at 1526).  \n                                        \n\n     On two other decree provisions, we believe modifications\n\nare  required.   First,  the district  court ordered  that an\n\narmed  guard and shackles no longer be used when transporting\n\nCameron  outside the  facility unless  and until  a qualified\n\ndecision-maker determines this to be necessary.  Para. 3 (783\n\nF. Supp.  at 1526).   In matters  of security, as  opposed to\n\nadministrative convenience, the administrators' discretion is\n\nat   its  zenith   and  Cameron   is  still   under  criminal\n\nsentence.10   An armed  guard and shackles  may seem needless\n\nprecautions for an amputee,  but we think that the  Treatment\n\nCenter should not be obliged to suspend its specific security\n\nmeasures  for outside  visits while  Cameron's case  is being\n\nreexamined.   If the  district court  wishes to  require this\n\n                    \n\n     10M.G.L.  c.  123A,     6A, provides  that,  subject  to\nexceptions entrusted to an administrative board,  \"any person\ncommitted as a sexually dangerous person . . . shall  be held\nin secure custody.\"  Discharge from the Treatment Center does\nnot \"terminate . . . any . . . unexpired sentence.\"  Id.   9.\n                                                       \n\n                             -18-\n\narmed-guard-and-shackles  requirement to be re-examined on an\n\nexpedited basis, that is within its province.\n\n     Second, we similarly modify the district court's general\n\ninjunction  preventing the  Treatment Center  \"from enforcing\n\nthe  current   disciplinary  system,  run  by  Department  of\n\nCorrection  personnel, against  Cameron\" until  a new  system\n\nsuitable to his needs is constructed.  Para. 7 (783 F.  Supp.\n\nat  1526).  We have no problem with the decree's requirements\n\nthat   the  administrators   consider  whether   changes  are\n\nwarranted in the  current system  as applied  to Cameron  and\n\nthat  medical judgments be weighed  in this process.   But we\n\nthink  that a  generally phrased  suspension of  \"the current\n\ndisciplinary system\" in the meantime cuts too broadly and may\n\nraise security issues as well.\n\n     Finally, we sustain  three unqualified decree provisions\n\nmade by  the  district  court: that  Cameron  be  allowed  to\n\ncontinue, as apparently he is at present,  visits to Veterans\n\nAdministration   facilities   related   to  his   amputation,\n\ncirculatory problems, and possible cancer; that the \"consent\"\n\nto  double bunking  be waived  as  to Cameron,  the \"consent\"\n\nbeing  largely symbolic;  and that  a handicapped  accessible\n\nroom,  including  a  hospital   bed  if  necessary,  be  made\n\navailable to him.  Paras. 2, 9, 10 (783 F. Supp. at 1526-27).\n\nThese specifics of relief lie largely within the  judgment of\n\n                             -19-\n\nthe district court, and  the state's brief makes  no targeted\n\nshowing that these provisions are improper.\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n     No one who reviews this record can dispute that  Cameron\n\nhas  done  harm in  the  past,  nor doubt  that  he has  been\n\nafflicted  with serious mental illness.   The findings of the\n\ndistrict court suggest that, without special attention to his\n\npeculiar circumstances,  further damage  will be done  to his\n\nmental condition.  We conclude that the state does have a Due\n\nProcess  Clause  obligation,  to   be  balanced  by  it  with\n\ncompeting  demands and interests, to seek to limit the extent\n\nto which  it worsens Cameron's condition  and thereby extends\n\nhis detention indefinitely.  Needless to say, there can be no\n\nprecision in such a Due Process Clause \"standard\" nor any way\n\nto  avoid  further  dispute  about its  application,  if  the\n\nparties are bent on dispute.  \n\n     The district  judge,  we think,  had the  right idea  in\n\ndirecting  the Treatment  Center  to undertake  a good  faith\n\nreappraisal  of its policies as applied to Cameron.  The more\n\nswiftly the  matter  is returned  to  that forum,  with  that\n\nperspective,  the better  off Cameron  will be.   As  for the\n\nstate, it  may regard the district judge's  strictures on its\n\nattitude  as unfair  and  heedless of  its  past efforts  for\n\nCameron.  But the injunction, at least as we have adjusted it\n\nand delimited  its future  effect, is not  unduly burdensome.\n\n                             -20-\n\nLike  Cameron,  the  state  has  an  evident  interest  in  a\n\nresolution that avoids further litigation.\n\n     The district court's injunction is modified as set forth\n                                                \n\nabove and is otherwise  affirmed, with the clarifications and\n                                \n\nupon  the  grounds  stated in  this  opinion.    No costs  or\n\nattorneys'  fees shall  be  awarded in  connection with  this\n\nappeal.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                     \n\n                             -21-\n",

This case  was brought by Robert\n                          \n\nCameron,  who  is  currently  detained  in the  Massachusetts\n\nTreatment Center  for the Sexually  Dangerous (\"the Treatment\n\nCenter\").  The defendants,  whom we refer to as  \"the state,\"\n\nare officials  who are responsible for  the Treatment Center.\n\nIn  substance,  Cameron  complains  that  his  conditions  of\n\nconfinement violate the Due  Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment  and   his   asserted  constitutional   \"right   to\n\ntreatment.\"  \n\n     After  a   bench  trial  the   district  court   granted\n\ninjunctive  relief and  the state  appealed.   We  modify the\n\ninjunction in accordance with  this opinion and, with certain\n\nclarifications, otherwise  affirm most of the  relief ordered\n\nby  the district  court.   Our  decision  is based  upon  the\n\ndistrict court's findings  but rests upon somewhat  different\n\nlegal grounds.\n\n             I.  THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n\n     On December  13, 1978, Cameron was  convicted in Vermont\n\nof  aggravated  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon  and  sexual\n\nassault--apparently  attempted rape--and sentenced  to a term\n\nof   six  to  twenty  years.    He  was  then  extradited  to\n\nMassachusetts  and  convicted  on  September  12,  1979,  for\n\nassault with  intent to  rape, kidnapping, and  other crimes,\n\nand  sentenced to a term  of ten to  twenty years, commencing\n\nafter the Vermont sentence.   On being paroled by  Vermont on\n\n                             -2-\n\nJuly  12,  1982,  Cameron  began  serving  his  Massachusetts\n\nsentence, which at the time of trial was set to expire in the\n\nyear 2002.1\n\n     After serving several  years in a  Massachusetts prison,\n\nCameron   on  November   14,  1985,   was  adjudged   by  the\n\nMassachusetts  Superior  Court  to be  a  sexually  dangerous\n\nperson  under M.G.L. c. 123A,  and committed to the Treatment\n\nCenter for a period of one day to life.  The occasion for the\n\ncommitment is  not described.   The Treatment Center,  one of\n\nseveral  facilities   located  at  MCI   Bridgewater,  has  a\n\ncheckered history, much of  it embroiled in litigation, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nLangton  v. Johnston,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557986\"><a href=\"/opinion/557986/william-langton-v-philip-johnston-john-bruder-john-bruder-v-philip/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st  Cir. 1991),  and\n                    \n\nM.G.L. c.  123A itself has an uncertain future.2  Most of the\n\nTreatment  Center's  inhabitants  have   underlying  criminal\n\nconvictions,   and   it  is   administered  jointly   by  the\n\nDepartments of Mental Health  and Corrections to address both\n\nthe  medical and security aims of the Center.  Cameron's stay\n\n                    \n\n     1The   district   court   opinion   recites   that   the\nMassachusetts  sentence  ended  in  February  1992;  but  the\nparties  advise us that Cameron's release date at the time of\ntrial was 2002.  Cameron's brief says that this period may be\nshortened by good time credits and possible parole.\n\n     2The statute  is one of the  so-called sexual psychopath\nlaws enacted  in the 1940s  in a  number of states.   See  C.\n                                                         \nTenney, Sex, Sanity and Stupidity in Massachusetts, 42 B.U.L.\n                                                  \nRev.  1  (1962).    In 1990,  the  Massachusetts  legislature\ncurtailed  new admissions  into  the Treatment  Center.   See\n                                                             \nLangton, 928 F.2d at 1209.\n       \n\n                             -3-\n\nat  the  Treatment  Center appears  to  have  been even  more\n\nunhappy than normal.\n\n     Although the  parties agree  on little else,  it appears\n\nthat  Cameron who  is  50 years  old  and a  Vietnam  veteran\n\nsuffers from severe psychological disorders.  In the words of\n\nthe  district court,  \"Cameron suffers  from a  borderline or\n\nmixed   personality   disorder   and  post-traumatic   stress\n\ndisorder.  There is also no dispute that as a result . . . he\n\nmay  often act  in  a paranoid  and confrontational  manner.\"\n\nCameron  v. Tomes, 783 F.  Supp. 1511, 1517  (D. Mass. 1992).\n                 \n\nPsychological treatment is available at the Treatment Center-\n\n-indeed,  its availability  is provided  for under  a consent\n\njudgment entered many years  ago3--but Cameron found what was\n\noffered unsuitable  until 1989 when he  established a working\n\nrelationship with a therapist.\n\n     In  the meantime,  Cameron brought  the present  suit in\n\n1986 challenging his conditions  of confinement.  Counsel was\n\nassigned,  his  claims  evolved,  and in  December  1991  and\n\nJanuary 1992,  the district  court conducted a  six-day bench\n\ntrial  in the case.   In his  opinion issued  on February 14,\n\n1992,  the  district  judge   declared  that  Cameron  had  a\n\n                    \n\n     3Regulations adopted pursuant to the decree provide that\n\"[e]very  patient shall  be offered  treatment to  effect his\nearly return to public society.  Such treatment shall consist\nof  medical, psychiatric  [and other  services] .  . .   Such\ntreatment   shall  be  administered  .  .   .  in  the  least\nrestrictive   conditions  which  are   consistent  with  [the\npatient's] security needs.\"  Langton, 928 F.2d at 1211.\n                                    \n\n                             -4-\n\n\"constitutional  right to  minimally adequate  treatment [for\n\nhis mental disorders] based upon the exercise of professional\n\njudgment.\"   783  F. Supp.  at 1516.   The  court rejected  a\n\nmotion to dismiss by the state, which had argued that no such\n\nconstitutional  right existed.   Id.   It  also rejected  the\n                                   \n\nstate's res  judicata defense, id.  at 1516-17, based  on the\n                                 \n\nLangton case where  a different district judge had found that\n       \n\nthe  Treatment  Center was  in  general  compliance with  the\n\nconsent decree.  See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1208-16.\n                            \n\n     The  district  court then  ruled  that, on  a  number of\n\nissues,  those in  charge of  the  Treatment Center  had made\n\njudgments  about Cameron  and enforced  policies  against him\n\nwithout,  or   contrary  to,   the  advice  of   the  medical\n\nprofessionals involved  in his  treatment.   783 F.  Supp. at\n\n1518-25.  The district  court made specific findings relating\n\nto  Cameron's  access to  outside  medical care,  the  use of\n\nshackles and an armed guard in transporting  him, his housing\n\nin  the  facility,  physical  searches of  him,  and  similar\n\nmatters.  The  court then  granted injunctive  relief on  ten\n\ndifferent matters.  Id. at 1526-27.\n                      \n\n     First, and most broadly, the court ordered the pertinent\n\nadministrative board within  the Treatment Center to  conduct\n\nan immediate  review  of his  current  sexual  dangerousness,\n\nappropriate  treatment and  conditions,  and his  request  to\n\nparticipate in  what is called the  community access program.\n\n                             -5-\n\n783 F. Supp.  at 1526.   This injunctive  provision ended  by\n\nstating:    \"All  final  decisions  on   Cameron's  long-term\n\ntreatment,  including  his  participation  in  the  community\n\naccess program, must be made by a qualified professional,  or\n\nwith due respect and  regard for the judgment of  a qualified\n\nprofessional.\"  Id.\n                  \n\n     Several other decree provisions are similarly qualified.\n\nThe court suspended the use of shackles and an armed guard in\n\ntransporting Cameron  for  outside medical  care  unless  and\n\nuntil  \"a qualified  decision  maker determines  through  the\n\nexercise  of professional  judgment that such  restraints are\n\nprofessionally  acceptable,  based  on  a  weighing  of  [the\n\nstate's] needs along with Cameron's treatment needs.\"  783 F.\n\nSupp. at 1526.   Prohibited, under a  similar condition, were\n\nsubjecting Cameron to a restrictive internal movement policy,\n\nto  an intrusive  search  procedure previously  used and  so-\n\ncalled   \"oral  cavity   searches,\"   and  to   the  \"current\n\ndisciplinary system\" of the  Treatment Center.  Id. at  1526-\n                                                  \n\n27.\n\n     Finally,  without any  qualification as  to professional\n\njudgment, the  court ordered that Cameron  be allowed medical\n\ntreatment  at Veterans Administration facilities for specific\n\nmedical conditions, that he be allowed housing in the maximum\n\nprivilege unit of the  Treatment Center without consenting to\n\nshare  a  room, and  that  a handicapped  accessible  room be\n\n                             -6-\n\nimmediately made available  to him.   783 F.  Supp. at  1526.\n\nThis  last direction, as well  as several of  the others, was\n\nrelated  to   physical  disabilities  suffered   by  Cameron,\n\nincluding the  amputation of  a  leg due  to infection  while\n\nCameron was in the care of the state.  \n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Res Judicata.   The  state's threshold objection  to the\n                 \n\nsuit  is  that  Cameron's  claims are  encompassed  by  prior\n\nlitigation   and  are  therefore   barred  as  res  judicata.\n                                                            \n\nEmphasizing the  \"claim preclusion\" branch  of res  judicata,\n                                                            \n\nthe  state's brief says that one of the consolidated district\n\ncourt cases  embraced by  Langton--Bruder v. Johnston--was  a\n                                                     \n\nclass action  suit concerning the right to  treatment for all\n\npersons  confined  at  the   Treatment  Center  as  of  1987.\n\nCameron, says the  state, was a  member of the class  and the\n\nstate prevailed in that case on the ground that treatment was\n\nadequately provided.\n\n     We agree with the district court that the state has made\n\nno showing that  Cameron's claim is  barred by res  judicata.\n                                                            \n\nCases on res judicata, ample in many areas, are fairly sparse\n                     \n\nwhere preclusion  of distinctive  individual claims  is urged\n\nbased upon an earlier  class action judgment.  But  in Cooper\n                                                             \n\nv. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), the\n                                   \n\nSupreme Court  confirmed what  common sense would  suggest: a\n\nclass action judgment--there, in a discrimination case--binds\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe class members as  to matters actually litigated  but does\n\nnot resolve any claim  based on individual circumstances that\n\nwas not addressed in the class action.  Id. at 880-82.\n                                          \n\n     Under Cooper,  we think  that res judicata  plainly does\n                                               \n\nnot apply in  this instance.  The several law suits and years\n\nof proceedings embraced by Langton require pages to describe,\n                                  \n\nbut  the  suits were  concerned  with  fairly general  issues\n\n(e.g., physical plant, sequestration, equality  of treatment)\n    \n\nand with specific claims  of individuals other than Cameron.4\n\nThe  closest that that litigation  came to this  case was (1)\n\nendorsement of  a general requirement of  treatment set forth\n\nin  state regulations,  (2) rejection  of a  charge that  the\n\nauthorized  absence  program   was  underutilized,  and   (3)\n\nrejection  of  a  general  attack  on  the  \"double  bunking\"\n\nrequirement.   These claims dealt with  the general condition\n\nof  inhabitants  of the  Treatment  Center.   If  Langton has\n                                                         \n\nanything else in  common with  this case, the  state has  not\n\nmentioned it.\n\n     This  case, by  contrast, rests  primarily  on Cameron's\n\nclaims   that   his   unusual   situation   requires  special\n\naccommodations:   specifically, that his  physical disability\n\naffects his  need for outside medical  visits, freer movement\n\n                    \n\n     4A  detailed history  of the  litigation and  the issues\ndecided is  contained in the thorough,  171-page, unpublished\ndecision  of  Judge  Mazzone,  which this  court  in  Langton\n                                                             \naffirmed on all issues apart from attorney's fees.\n\n                             -8-\n\nwithin   the   Treatment   Center,   and   separate   bunking\n\narrangements  adapted to  his handicap,  and that  his mental\n\ncondition  (what lay  people  would probably  call  paranoia)\n\nmakes ordinary physical  searches, disciplinary  arrangements\n\nand  other  constraints  unsuitable,  indeed  psychologically\n\ndangerous, for him.  There is no suggestion by the state that\n\nthese issues  peculiar to Cameron were  actually litigated in\n\nthe Langton case.\n           \n\n     Thus, the  state's claim reduces itself  to the argument\n\nthat  Cameron  had to  litigate those  issues in  the earlier\n                  \n\ncases or forever  hold his peace.  To describe  this claim is\n\nto refute  it:   class action institutional  litigation often\n\naddresses general circumstances,  not the distinctive  plight\n\nof someone claiming special  needs or status.  To  the extent\n\nindividual concerns were addressed in Langton, Cameron is not\n                                             \n\neven mentioned  in the  district court  decision.  Nor  could\n\nearlier  cases deal with  later occurring  events that  are a\n                               \n\npart of  Cameron's present case.  In theory, claim preclusion\n\nis  possible   where  an   earlier  class  action   claim  is\n\nessentially the same as a later action for individual relief,\n\nand issue preclusion is possible where a fact resolved in the\n\nclass  action  proves important  in  the later  action.   See\n                                                             \n\nCooper,  467 U.S. at 880-82.   No such overlap has been shown\n      \n\nhere.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     The Merits.   The district court  in this case  premised\n               \n\nits  decision  on  what  it  deemed  to  be  two  established\n\nconstitutional  rights possessed  by  those at  the Treatment\n\nCenter:  \"a  constitutional   right  to  minimally   adequate\n\ntreatment [for  mental disorders] based upon  the exercise of\n\nprofessional  judgment,\" 783 F. Supp. at 1516, and a right to\n\nbe free from  \"[b]odily restraints\" except  \"when and to  the\n\nextent  professional judgment deems  this necessary .  . . .\"\n\nId. at 1520.   It  is not entirely  clear whose  professional\n  \n\njudgment--medical or administrative--the  district court  had\n\nin  mind; but the implication  of its discussion  is that the\n\nadministrators of  the facility  are bound  to listen  to the\n\njudgment of  the medical professionals and to  heed it unless\n\nthey offer good reason for  refusing to do so.  Id.  at 1519-\n                                                  \n\n20.  \n\n     Both  sides  on this  appeal  seek  a  decision  on  the\n\nconstitutional \"right  to treatment,\" the  state urging  that\n\nnone exists  and Cameron supporting  the district court.   In\n\nour view, a  decision on  the abstract issue  of \"a right  to\n\ntreatment\" is not  necessary for a disposition of  this case;\n\nand  the concept has only  a remote connection  to the actual\n\nrelief sought.   We address this  point briefly, against  the\n\nbackground   of  prior  \"right   to  treatment\"  law,  before\n\nconsidering Cameron's own situation and the proper touchstone\n\nfor appraising his claims.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     It  is settled that those who are confined by the state,\n\nfor whatever  reason, are entitled under  the Constitution to\n\nfood,  clothing,  medical  care,  and  reasonable  efforts to\n\nsecure  physical  safety.   Beyond  such obvious  essentials,\n\nhowever, guidance from the  Supreme Court is largely confined\n\nto  one cautiously phrased decision.   In Youngberg v. Romeo,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1982), a  mother,  unable  to  care for  her\n\nretarded  child, placed him  in a  state institution.

While both decisions spoke\nof  the state's obligation to  provide for medical needs, the\ncontext was  very far removed  from any generalized  right to\ntreatment for psychological conditions.\n\n     8Whatever other significance it  may have, we think that\nCameron's criminal sentence does refute  any claim that he is\nentitled under the Constitution to minimum physical restraint\nbased on the judgment of his doctors.  Quite unlike the child\nin  Youngberg,   Cameron  is  under   criminal  sentence   of\n             \nimprisonment for serious and violent crimes.  To that extent,\n\n                             -13-\n\nvery least, the Court's approach in Youngberg suggests hewing\n                                             \n\nto the case-by-case approach.\n\n     Taking that  approach here, we think  the touchstone for\n\nCameron's claims is the Due Process Clause of the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, requiring  conditions that  do not fall  below the\n\nminimum standards of civilized decency.  See generally Rochin\n                                                             \n\nv.

Under  this rubric,\n              \n\ncontext works in Cameron's favor.  While  his prison sentence\n\nwill expire in 2002  or even earlier, his confinement  in the\n\nTreatment Center is from  one day to life and  will never end\n\nunless his condition improves and he is found to be no longer\n\nsexually dangerous.   Thus,  Cameron's best argument  is that\n\nthe   state's   ordinary  procedures   and   constraints  are\n\naffirmatively and needlessly worsening his  mental condition,\n                                      \n\nso that  he may well be confined  long after his sentence has\n\nexpired.  This is a claim with some bite, no  matter how much\n\nlatitude states ordinarily have to run their institutions.\n\n     Further, the  findings  of  the  district  court,  which\n\ncontrol unless clearly erroneous, Fed.

The  findings amount  to a  determination by  the\n\ndistrict  court  that  procedures  that might  ordinarily  be\n\napplied--such  as certain  of the  searches and  the internal\n\n                    \n\nhe  lacks  the  same  \"liberty\"  interest  as  the  child  in\nYoungberg.\n         \n\n                             -14-\n\nmovement controls--worsen Cameron's condition and may well be\n                                                 \n\nunnecessary in  this case.  See 783 F.

Id.\n                   \n\n     The  state  broadly  disputes this  version  of  events,\n\npointing  to other evidence  showing how  much it  has helped\n\nCameron  and tried to accommodate his special needs.  It does\n\nnot, however, make much effort in its brief to rebut specific\n\nfindings as to  specific episodes.   We think  there is  some\n\nconflict in the  evidence but also that  the district judge's\n\nfindings  are not clearly erroneous.   It is  true that these\n\nfindings  were made in the framework of a legal analysis that\n\nwe do not adopt, but the  findings fit well enough into a due\n\nprocess framework and  this court may  affirm on any  grounds\n\nsupported by evidence.

A  forcible search  of Cameron  while handcuffed,\nwhich  the court found may well  have been unnecessary, drove\nCameron  into  moods  of  \"helplessness,  anger,  despair and\nhopelessness . . . .\"  Id. at 1523.\n                         \n\n                             -15-\n\n     Relief  Ordered by  the District  Court.   The immediate\n                                            \n\nrelief  ordered by  the district  court is,  with one  or two\n\nexceptions,  fairly  modest,   primarily  requiring   further\n\nconsideration  of Cameron's  case and some  interim measures.\n\nImportantly, the  court has ordered a  general reappraisal of\n\nCameron's treatment and conditions, with decisions to be made\n\nby the administrators  \"with due respect  and regard for  the\n\njudgment of a qualified professional.\"  783 F. Supp. at 1526.\n\nBut given the district court's use in several contexts of the\n\n\"professional judgment\" standard, a word is  in order for the\n\nguidance  of the parties  and for any  future litigation that\n\nmay ensue.\n\n     In an institution  like the Treatment  Center, as in  an\n\nordinary prison,  security  and administrative  concerns  may\n\nclash with  the welfare and  comfort of  individuals, as  the\n\ndistrict  court recognized.  This  was so in  the facility at\n\nissue in Youngberg, 457 U.S.  at 320, and it is surely  so in\n                  \n\nthe  Treatment Center  where most  if not all  those detained\n\nhave been convicted of crimes and many may be dangerous.  Any\n\nprofessional   judgment  that  decides   an  issue  involving\n                                      \n\nconditions   of  confinement   must   embrace  security   and\n\nadministration, and not merely medical judgments.\n\n     Thus when  it comes to  appraising the judgments  of the\n\nadministrators,  it does not follow that they are bound to do\n\nwhat the doctors say is best  for Cameron even if the doctors\n\n                             -16-\n\nare  unanimous.   The administrators  are responsible  to the\n\nstate  and to the public for making professional judgments of\n\ntheir  own, encompassing  institutional  concerns as  well as\n\nindividual welfare.  Nothing in the Constitution mechanically\n\ngives  controlling   weight  to   one  set  of   professional\n\njudgments.   Indeed, when it comes  to constitutional rights,\n\nnone of the  professionals has the  last word.   Professional\n\njudgment, as the Supreme Court has explained,  creates only a\n\n\"presumption\"  of  correctness;  welcome  or  not, the  final\n\nresponsibility  belongs to  the courts.   See  Youngberg, 457\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 323.\n\n     With this clarification as  to the role of \"professional\n\njudgment,\" we  sustain the first injunctive  relief provision\n\nordered  by  the  district   court    directing  the  general\n\nreappraisal of Cameron's  personal dangerousness  and of  his\n\ngeneral  conditions of confinement.  Para. 1 (783 F. Supp. at\n\n1526).  The findings noted  above and the evidence  portrayed\n\nin the  district court's decision support  this fairly modest\n\ndirective.  In framing equitable relief, a district court has\n\nsubstantial  latitude,  and  we  think its  \"remand\"  to  the\n\nTreatment Center administration is well within its authority.\n\n     We  also conclude that, on  the same basis  and with the\n\nsame clarification  as to the role  of professional judgment,\n\nthe  district court's findings, see 783  F. Supp. at 1522-24,\n                                   \n\nsupport  several other  conditioned decree provisions:   that\n\n                             -17-\n\nadministrators  consider  requests by  Cameron  for treatment\n\noutside the Treatment Center, para. 4 (id. at 1526); that the\n                                         \n\nten-minute movement  restriction and oral-cavity  searches be\n\nsuspended  as  to  Cameron   unless  and  until  a  qualified\n\ndecision-maker  concludes  that  they  are   appropriate  for\n\nCameron; and  that the \"Extraction Team\"  searches of Cameron\n\nbe barred unless there is prior consultation with a Treatment\n\nCenter clinician.  Paras. 5, 6 and 8 (id. at 1526).  \n                                        \n\n     On two other decree provisions, we believe modifications\n\nare  required.   First,  the district  court ordered  that an\n\narmed  guard and shackles no longer be used when transporting\n\nCameron  outside the  facility unless  and until  a qualified\n\ndecision-maker determines this to be necessary.  Para. 3 (783\n\nF. Supp.  at 1526).   In matters  of security, as  opposed to\n\nadministrative convenience, the administrators' discretion is\n\nat   its  zenith   and  Cameron   is  still   under  criminal\n\nsentence.10   An armed  guard and shackles  may seem needless\n\nprecautions for an amputee,  but we think that the  Treatment\n\nCenter should not be obliged to suspend its specific security\n\nmeasures  for outside  visits while  Cameron's case  is being\n\nreexamined.   If the  district court  wishes to  require this\n\n                    \n\n     10M.G.L.  c.  123A,     6A, provides  that,  subject  to\nexceptions entrusted to an administrative board,  \"any person\ncommitted as a sexually dangerous person . . . shall  be held\nin secure custody.\"  Discharge from the Treatment Center does\nnot \"terminate . . . any . . . unexpired sentence.\"  Id.   9.\n                                                       \n\n                             -18-\n\narmed-guard-and-shackles  requirement to be re-examined on an\n\nexpedited basis, that is within its province.\n\n     Second, we similarly modify the district court's general\n\ninjunction  preventing the  Treatment Center  \"from enforcing\n\nthe  current   disciplinary  system,  run  by  Department  of\n\nCorrection  personnel, against  Cameron\" until  a new  system\n\nsuitable to his needs is constructed.  Para. 7 (783 F.  Supp.\n\nat  1526).  We have no problem with the decree's requirements\n\nthat   the  administrators   consider  whether   changes  are\n\nwarranted in the  current system  as applied  to Cameron  and\n\nthat  medical judgments be weighed  in this process.   But we\n\nthink  that a  generally phrased  suspension of  \"the current\n\ndisciplinary system\" in the meantime cuts too broadly and may\n\nraise security issues as well.\n\n     Finally, we sustain  three unqualified decree provisions\n\nmade by  the  district  court: that  Cameron  be  allowed  to\n\ncontinue, as apparently he is at present,  visits to Veterans\n\nAdministration   facilities   related   to  his   amputation,\n\ncirculatory problems, and possible cancer; that the \"consent\"\n\nto  double bunking  be waived  as  to Cameron,  the \"consent\"\n\nbeing  largely symbolic;  and that  a handicapped  accessible\n\nroom,  including  a  hospital   bed  if  necessary,  be  made\n\navailable to him.  Paras. 2, 9, 10 (783 F. Supp. at 1526-27).\n\nThese specifics of relief lie largely within the  judgment of\n\n                             -19-\n\nthe district court, and  the state's brief makes  no targeted\n\nshowing that these provisions are improper.\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n     No one who reviews this record can dispute that  Cameron\n\nhas  done  harm in  the  past,  nor doubt  that  he has  been\n\nafflicted  with serious mental illness.   The findings of the\n\ndistrict court suggest that, without special attention to his\n\npeculiar circumstances,  further damage  will be done  to his\n\nmental condition.  We conclude that the state does have a Due\n\nProcess  Clause  obligation,  to   be  balanced  by  it  with\n\ncompeting  demands and interests, to seek to limit the extent\n\nto which  it worsens Cameron's condition  and thereby extends\n\nhis detention indefinitely.  Needless to say, there can be no\n\nprecision in such a Due Process Clause \"standard\" nor any way\n\nto  avoid  further  dispute  about its  application,  if  the\n\nparties are bent on dispute.  \n\n     The district  judge,  we think,  had the  right idea  in\n\ndirecting  the Treatment  Center  to undertake  a good  faith\n\nreappraisal  of its policies as applied to Cameron.  The more\n\nswiftly the  matter  is returned  to  that forum,  with  that\n\nperspective,  the better  off Cameron  will be.   As  for the\n\nstate, it  may regard the district judge's  strictures on its\n\nattitude  as unfair  and  heedless of  its  past efforts  for\n\nCameron.  But the injunction, at least as we have adjusted it\n\nand delimited  its future  effect, is not  unduly burdensome.\n\n                             -20-\n\nLike  Cameron,  the  state  has  an  evident  interest  in  a\n\nresolution that avoids further litigation.\n\n     The district court's injunction is modified as set forth\n                                                \n\nabove and is otherwise  affirmed, with the clarifications and\n                                \n\nupon  the  grounds  stated in  this  opinion.    No costs  or\n\nattorneys'  fees shall  be  awarded in  connection with  this\n\nappeal.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                     \n\n                             -21-\n</pre>",
