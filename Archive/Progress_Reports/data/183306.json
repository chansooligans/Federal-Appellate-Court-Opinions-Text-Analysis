Three union pension and welfare\n\nfunds1   appeal   from   a   district   court    order   dismissing   at    the\n\ncomplaint stage their putative class action against eight trusts,\n\nthe \"depositor\" that organized them, the trusts' underwriters and\n\nfive officers of the depositor.           The lawsuit sought redress for\n\nlosses   suffered    when    plaintiffs    acquired      trust   certificates\n\nrepresenting mortgage-backed securities.          The background facts are\n\nlargely undisputed.\n\n           The lead defendant, Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation\n\n(\"Nomura Asset\"), played the organizing role in the creation of the\n\nsecurities at issue in this case.               As depositor, it acquired\n\nmortgages from various banks and transferred them to the eight\n\ntrusts, all of which are separate legal entities.                 Each trust\n\npooled the mortgages acquired by it and, with Nomura Asset, issued\n\ntrust certificates representing interests in that trust.                   Then\n\nNomura Asset and the trusts worked with underwriters to sell the\n\ncertificates to investors.\n\n           The certificates constitute securities under the federal\n\nsecurities laws, and to permit their initial sale, a registration\n\nstatement was required, disclosing information about the securities\n\nbeing offered. One registration statement, filed on July 22, 2005,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Plumbers' Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund (\"Plumbers' Fund\"),\nPlumbers' & Pipefitters' Welfare Educational Fund (\"Plumbers' &\nPipefitters' Fund\") and the NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund (\"NECA-\nIBEW Fund\").\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcovered three trusts (2006-AP1, 2006-AR1, 2006-AR2); the other,\n\nfiled on April 16, 2006, covered the remaining five (2006-AF1,\n\n2006-AF2,    2006-AR3,     2006-AR4,     2006-WF1).          These   were   \"shelf\n\nregistrations,\" see 17 C.F.R. § 230.415(a) (2010), signaling an\n\nintent to offer securities in the future and containing certain\n\ninformation about Nomura Asset, the trusts and the securities.\n\n            The registration statements were not themselves offerings\n\nand did not become effective until Nomura Asset and the trusts\n\nupdated them by filing prospectus supplements that described the\n\ndetails   of     the   offering   for    each       trust.    The    registration\n\nstatements and prospectus supplements (collectively, \"offering\n\ndocuments\") explain in detail the characteristics of the mortgages\n\nthat Nomura Asset acquired and transferred to each trust.                      The\n\nfederal securities laws, yet to be discussed, impose liability for\n\nfalse or misleading statements causing harm to purchasers.\n\n            In    this   case,    plaintiffs        bought trust certificates\n\nrepresenting interests in two of the eight trusts; one trust (AP1\n\ntrust) was covered by the earlier registration statement and a\n\nSeptember 27, 2005, prospectus supplement; the other (AF1 trust),\n\nby the later of the two registration statements and a May 25, 2006,\n\nprospectus     supplement.        One   of    the    three   plaintiffs     bought\n\ncertificates in the AF1 trust, a second in the AP1 trust and the\n\nthird in both trusts.        Thereafter, on November 13, 2007, Moody's\n\ndowngraded the rating of all of the certificates for all eight\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ftrusts and the certificates are now worth much less than what\n\nplaintiffs originally paid for them. This lawsuit followed shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n            On January 31, 2008, one of the three union funds filed\n\nsuit in state court, asserting violations of sections 11, 12(a)(2)\n\nand 15 of the Securities Act of            1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k(a),\n\n77l(a)(2), 77o (2006).      Section 11 imposes liability for false or\n\nmisleading statements contained in a registration statement, id. §\n\n77k(a); section 12(a)(2) imposes similar liability on sellers who\n\nmake such statements in a prospectus or oral communication, id. §\n\n77l(a)(2).    Section 15 imposes liability on one who \"controls any\n\nperson liable\" under sections 11 or 12.        Id. § 77o.\n\n            The case was removed to federal district court, the other\n\nfunds    entered   as   plaintiffs   and   ultimately   a   joint   amended\n\ncomplaint was filed listing as defendants Nomura Asset, the eight\n\ntrusts, the trusts' underwriters and five officers and directors of\n\nNomura Asset.2     The gravamen of the complaint is that the offering\n\n\n     2\n      Nomura Securities International, Inc. (\"Nomura Securities\")\nwas the sole underwriter for the AF1, AP1, AR1 and AR2 trusts; the\nAF2 trust was underwritten by Nomura Securities, Greenwich Capital\nMarkets, Inc. (\"GCM\") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\nInc. (\"Merrill Lynch\"); the AR3 trust was underwritten by Nomura\nSecurities and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (\"Goldman\"); the AR4 trust was\nunderwritten by UBS Securities LLC (\"UBS\") and GCM; and the WF1\ntrust was underwritten by Nomura Securities and Citigroup Global\nMarkets, Inc. (\"CGMI\"). The officers and directors are John P.\nGraham, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nomura Asset;\nNathan Gorin, Chief Financial Officer of Nomura Asset; and John\nMcCarthy and David Findlay, directors of Nomura Asset. (Another\ndefendant named in the complaint, Shunichi Ito, has apparently\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdocuments contained false or misleading statements, and as a result\n\nplaintiffs purchased securities whose true value when purchased was\n\nless than what was paid for them.           The suit was cast as a class\n\naction comprised of purchasers of the certificates of the eight\n\ntrusts covered by the two registration statements.\n\n           Defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim, Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).       On September 30, 2009, the district court\n\ngranted   defendants'   motions   to   dismiss    and     entered      judgment.\n\nClaims related to the trusts whose certificates had been purchased\n\nby none of the named plaintiffs were dismissed for lack of Article\n\nIII   standing;   claims   relating    to   the   other    two   trusts     were\n\ndismissed on statutory grounds; and no class was ever certified.\n\nThe present appeal followed.\n\n           Jurisdiction.     At the outset, plaintiffs say that the\n\noriginal action brought in state court may have been improperly\n\nremoved and that the district court may thus have lacked subject\n\nmatter    jurisdiction;    although     plaintiffs        did    not     contest\n\njurisdiction until they lost the case in the district court, lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction can be noticed at any time and\n\ncannot be waived.       United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630\n\n(2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 93-\n\n94 (1998).   But we conclude that any flaw in the removal was not\n\n\nnever been served with process.)\n\n                                  -6-\n\fone of subject matter jurisdiction and therefore has been waived or\n\nforfeited for lack of a timely objection.                  28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)\n\n(2006) (requiring objection within 30 days of removal).\n\n           Removal is ordinarily permitted in civil actions where\n\nthe same case could originally have been brought in federal court\n\n\"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).      One exception--section 22 of the Securities\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)--is that \"no case arising under [the\n\nSecurities   Act]   and   brought   in    any    State     court   of   competent\n\njurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.\"\n\nHowever, assuming that this limitation applied,3 we conclude that\n\nsection   22's   limitation   would      not    be   one    of   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction but merely an advantage that a plaintiff could forfeit\n\nby failure to make timely objection.\n\n           There are some casual references in reported circuit-\n\ncourt decisions to section 22 as a limitation on subject matter\n\njurisdiction, e.g., Emrich v. Touche Ross & Co., 846 F.2d 1190,\n\n1197-98 (9th Cir. 1988) (but the objection was made within 30 days,\n\nso that conclusion was dictum); Westinghouse Credit Corp. v.\n\nThompson, 987 F.2d 682, 683 (10th Cir. 1993) (but the remand order\n\n\n\n     3\n      Whether it applied depends on how one resolves a potential\nconflict between section 22 and language in a later statute,\nnamely, the Class Action Fairness Act's (\"CAFA\") removal provision.\nCompare Luther v. Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, 533 F.3d\n1031, 1034 (9th Cir. 2008), with Katz v. Gerardi, 552 F.3d 558, 562\n(7th Cir. 2009)--a dispute we need not address.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fwas unreviewable whatever the defect); yet a larger number of\n\ncircuits have held that similarly phrased anti-removal provisions\n\ndo not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.4\n\n          Civil suits asserting claims under the Securities Act are\n\nwithin the \"arising under\" clause of Article III and can easily be\n\nbrought as original actions in federal court.    15 U.S.C. § 77v(a).\n\nAlthough expressed as a bar on removal of such cases from state\n\ncourt, section 22(a)'s aim is not to preclude hearing such cases in\n\nfederal court but instead to \"favor[] plaintiffs' choice of forum.\"\n\nPinto v. Maremont Corp., 326 F. Supp. 165, 167 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1971);\n\nsee Cook, Recrafting the Jurisdictional Framework for Private\n\nRights of Action Under the Federal Securities Laws, 55 Am. U. L.\n\nRev. 621, 632-34 (2006).\n\n          Given that federal courts are otherwise competent to\n\naddress federal securities claims and do so all the time, it makes\n\nfar more sense to view section 22 as creating a waivable right to\n\ninsist on non-removal.   That course achieves the statute's aim to\n\nprotect the plaintiff's preference for a state forum, but it\n\nprevents the mischief of allowing a party to sit on an objection,\n\nraising it only if and when the objector is dissatisfied with the\n\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g., In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 592 F.3d 907, 912 (8th\nCir. 2010); Vasquez v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 292 F.3d 1049, 1062\n(9th Cir. 2002); Feichko v. Denver & Rio Grande W. R.R. Co., 213\nF.3d 586, 591 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied 531 U.S. 1074 (2001);\nBelcufine v. Aloe, 112 F.3d 633, 638 (3d Cir. 1997); Williams v. AC\nSpark Plugs, 985 F.2d 783, 787 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                -8-\n\fresult.           Cf. 14C C. Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure\n\n§ 3739, at 817-18 (4th ed. 2009) (limiting removal objections to\n\nthirty-day period prevents use of a defect as insurance against\n\nunfavorable developments).\n\n                  Standing.        The   more    difficult   threshold      question\n\npresented by the appeal is whether plaintiffs can pursue claims, to\n\nthe extent claims may be stated, based on offerings in which they\n\ndid not participate and against trusts whose certificates they did\n\nnot purchase. This issue, styled by defendants primarily as one of\n\nArticle III standing and secondarily as a standing issue under the\n\nSecurities Act, was resolved in defendants' favor by the district\n\ncourt.       The issue looks straightforward and one would expect it to\n\nbe well settled; neither assumption is entirely true.\n\n                  It is clear that the named plaintiffs have no claim on\n\ntheir own behalf based on trust certificates that they did not\n\nbuy;5       and    they   bought    no   certificates   issued   by   six    of   the\n\ndefendant trusts.             To the extent claims exist based on such\n\npurchases, they belong to the actual purchasers. Since a requisite\n\nof an ordinary case or controversy is an injury to the plaintiff\n\n\n\n        5\n      For section 11, see Barnes v. Osofsky, 373 F.2d 269, 273 (2d\nCir. 1967) (Friendly, J.) (an action under section 11 may be\nmaintained only by \"those who purchase securities that are the\ndirect subject of the prospectus and registration statement\")\n(internal quotation marks omitted); for section 12(a)(2), see\nPinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 644 (1988) (claims under section\n12(a)(2) are available only against person who offers or sells the\nsecurity to the plaintiff).\n\n                                           -9-\n\ftraceable to the defendant, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\n\nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992), it might follow that there is also no case\n\nor controversy between the named plaintiffs and the trusts from\n\nwhich they made no purchases.            Alas, the matter is not so simple.\n\n            In     a   properly    certified         class       action,    the   named\n\nplaintiffs regularly litigate not only their own claims but also\n\nclaims of other class members based on transactions in which the\n\nnamed plaintiffs played no part.             Yet, here certain defendants,\n\nincluding six of the eight trusts named as defendants, are not\n\nliable   to      the   named   plaintiffs       on    any    claims.         In   these\n\ncircumstances older cases, including a decision of this court, have\n\nrefused to allow the case to proceed--whether as a class action or\n\nnot--against defendants not implicated in any of the wrongs done to\n\nthe named plaintiffs.\n\n            Thus, in Barry v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co.,\n\n555 F.2d 3 (1st Cir. 1977), aff'd, 438 U.S. 531 (1978), Rhode\n\nIsland physicians and patients sought to bring a class action fraud\n\nclaim on behalf of all physicians and patients in the state against\n\nfour   insurance       companies   for    the    sale       of    certain    insurance\n\npolicies.     Id. at 5, 13.        Each of the insurance companies had\n\nalmost certainly sold such policies to some members of the class,\n\nbut none of the named plaintiffs ever bought that type of policy\n\nfrom two of the companies.          The district court declined to allow\n\nclaims against the latter two companies for the sale of those\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fpolicies and we held there was \"no error in the district court's\n\ndecision to adhere strictly to the traditional [standing] rules.\"\n\nId. at 13; see also Haas v. Pittsburgh Nat'l Bank, 526 F.2d 1083,\n\n1095-96 & n.18 (3d Cir. 1975).\n\n             How far Barry extends today may be debatable.       Although\n\nits discussion of the issue was terse and not the main focus of the\n\ndecision, its approach had support not only from sister circuit\n\ncases but from statements from the Supreme Court.          See Barry, 555\n\nF.2d at 13.     And several times since Barry the Supreme Court used\n\nArticle III concepts in refusing to permit class claims to extend\n\nto   those    suffering   injuries   materially    different   than   those\n\nsuffered by the named plaintiffs.           Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343,\n\n346-49, 358 & n.6 (1996); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999-1002\n\n(1982).6     For example, Blum stated:\n\n             It is axiomatic that the judicial power\n             conferred by Art. III may not be exercised\n             unless the plaintiff shows \"that he personally\n             has suffered some actual or threatened injury\n             as a result of some putatively illegal conduct\n             of the defendant.\" . . .     It is not enough\n             that the conduct of which the plaintiff\n             complains will injure someone.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      See also 1 J. McLaughlin, Class Actions § 4:28, at 659-60\n(6th ed. 2010) (\"In a multi-defendant case, a putative class\nrepresentative must allege that he or she has been injured by the\nconduct of each defendant to establish standing.\"); 5 J. Moore et\nal., Moore's Federal Practice § 26.63[1][b], at 23-304 (3d ed.\n2010) (\"If a complaint includes multiple claims, at least one named\nclass representative must have Article III standing to raise each\nclaim.\").\n\n                                     -11-\n\f457 U.S. at 999 (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood,\n\n441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979)).\n\n              But the Supreme Court has not been consistent.                  In\n\nOrtiz    v.   Fibreboard    Corp.,   527    U.S.    815   (1999),   and   Amchem\n\nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997), the Supreme Court\n\nruled that no class should be certified, but in doing so, it\n\nbypassed objections that some settling parties lacked standing,\n\nsaying    that   the   class   certification       issues   were    \"'logically\n\nantecedent' to Article III concerns,\" Ortiz, 527 U.S. at 831\n\n(quoting Amchem, 521 U.S. at 612).             And in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\n\nU.S. 244 (2003), the Court allowed the named class plaintiff to\n\nchallenge admissions practices as to college freshman even though\n\nhis status would have been that of a transfer student subject to\n\ndifferent rules.       Id. 263-65.\n\n              Further, several circuits have cut themselves loose from\n\na   strict    requirement   that,    in    a    plaintiff   class   action,   no\n\ndefendant may be sued unless a named plaintiff has a counterpart\n\nclaim against that defendant. Arguing that the class action should\n\nbe a flexible instrument, these courts conclude that the class\n\naction should embrace defendants against whom no named plaintiff\n\nhas a claim so long as the claims are essentially of the same\n\ncharacter as the claim against a properly named defendant, and that\n\nthe sorting out of this issue should be left to Rule 23 criteria\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\frather    than   by    use   of   standing   concepts      focusing     on   named\n\nplaintiffs.7\n\n            There is no reason to inventory stray Supreme Court\n\nquotations that can be found on both sides; nor is there a single\n\nrecent holding by the Court that with perfect clarity resolves the\n\nissue directly before us.         Indeed, Rule 23 criteria can still be\n\nused as a required tool for shaping the scope of a class action\n\nwithout abandoning the notion that Article III creates some outer\n\nlimit based on the incentives of the named plaintiffs to adequately\n\nlitigate issues of importance to them.            See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S.\n\n186, 204 (1962) (plaintiffs need \"such a personal stake in the\n\noutcome    of    the   controversy    as     to   assure    .   .   .   concrete\n\nadverseness\").\n\n            For the present, Barry--however terse its treatment--is\n\non our books; and we are inclined (and perhaps required) to follow\n\nits lead--with a qualification that does not affect the outcome in\n\nthis case. The qualification, on which we reserve judgment, is one\n\nwhere the claims of the named plaintiffs necessarily give them--not\n\n\n\n     7\n      Payton v. Cnty. of Kane, 308 F.3d 673, 680-81 (7th Cir.\n2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 812 (2003) (named plaintiffs were\nonly injured by two counties but may be entitled maintain class\naction against seventeen other counties that implemented the same\nstate statute in a materially identical fashion); Fallick v.\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 410, 421-24 (6th Cir. 1998)\n(although named plaintiff was only a participant in one ERISA plan,\nhe could represent a class against all of defendant's ERISA plans\nwhere the gravamen of the challenge was a general practice that\naffected all plans).\n\n                                      -13-\n\fjust their lawyers--essentially the same incentive to litigate the\n\ncounterpart claims of the class members because the establishment\n\nof the named plaintiffs' claims necessarily establishes those of\n\nother class members.     The matter is one of identity of issues not\n\nin the abstract but at a ground floor level.         In such a case, which\n\nmight include the kind of claims that were present in Payton, 308\n\nF.3d at 680, and Fallick, 162 F.3d at 423, the substance of the\n\nArticle III concern may vanish even if in form it might seem to\n\npersist.\n\n           Turning    back   to   our   own   situation--claims   based   on\n\nmortgage-backed securities--most district courts have continued to\n\nhold that named plaintiffs must themselves possess claims against\n\neach defendant.      E.g., In re Salomon Smith Barney Mut. Fund Fees\n\nLitig., 441 F. Supp. 2d 579, 604-08 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); In re Eaton\n\nVance Corp. Sec. Litig., 220 F.R.D. 162, 166-69 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\nIndeed, one court recently found that\n\n           [e]very court to address the issue in a\n           [mortgage-backed security] class action has\n           concluded that a plaintiff lacks standing\n           under . . . Article III . . . to represent the\n           interests of investors in [mortgage-backed\n           securities] offerings in which the [named]\n           plaintiffs did not themselves buy.\n\nMe. State Ret. Sys. v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 722 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1157, 1163 (C.D. Cal. 2010).       Interestingly, a handful of district\n\ncourt cases have allowed securities claims to proceed in situations\n\nthat may fit the possible exception we have outlined above.          E.g.,\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fIn re Am. Int'l Grp., Inc. 2008 Sec. Litig., No. 08 Civ. 4772(LTS),\n\n2010 WL 3768146, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010).\n\n          In our case, as in others involving mortgage-backed\n\nsecurities, the necessary identity of issues and alignment of\n\nincentives is not present so far as the claims involve sales of\n\ncertificates in the six trusts.    Each trust is backed by loans from\n\na different mix of banks; no named plaintiff has a significant\n\ninterest in establishing wrongdoing by the particular group of\n\nbanks that financed a trust from which the named plaintiffs made no\n\npurchases.   Thus, the claims related to the six trusts from which\n\nthe named plaintiffs never purchased securities were properly\n\ndismissed, as were the six trusts and defendants connected to only\n\nthose six trusts.\n\n          Although Nomura Asset is a common defendant with respect\n\nto all eight of the trusts, claims against it as well fail so far\n\nas they are based on the six trusts whose certificates were\n\npurchased by no named plaintiff.         Although Nomura Asset is a\n\nproperly named defendant, the named plaintiffs have no stake in\n\nestablishing liability as to misconduct involving the sales of\n\nthose certificates.   In the Supreme Court's words:      \"Nor does a\n\nplaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind\n\npossess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating\n\nconduct of another kind, although similar, to which he has not been\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fsubject.\"    Blum, 457 U.S. at 999; see also Lewis, 518 U.S. at 358\n\nn.6.\n\n            Adequacy of claims.    The district court held that on the\n\nface of the complaint, no claims were sufficiently stated.         We\n\nreview that ruling de novo, accepting as true all well-pled facts\n\nin the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nplaintiffs.    SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir. 2010) (en\n\nbanc).   But, while this much is clear, the usual difficulty of\n\nparsing and evaluating misrepresentation claims at the complaint\n\nstage in securities cases is further complicated by recent case law\n\ntightening the sieve through which a well-pled complaint must pass.\n\n            To state a claim, the complaint must \"contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that\n\nis plausible on its face,'\"       Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937,\n\n1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n\n(2007)); \"'naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement'\"\n\nneed not be accepted, Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 266 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949); and \"[i]f the\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint are too meager, vague, or\n\nconclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of\n\nmere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal,\" Tambone, 597\n\nF.3d at 442.\n\n            The district court found that of plaintiffs' main efforts\n\nto assert adequate claims, all three failed.     The statute provides\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthe blueprint against which a claim must be measured and we start\n\nby    outlining    the   requirements         of   section   11,    which     reads   in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n            In   case  any   part  of   the  registration\n            statement, when such part became effective,\n            contained an untrue statement of a material\n            fact or omitted to state a material fact\n            required to be stated therein or necessary to\n            make the statements therein not misleading,\n            any person acquiring such security . . .\n            may . . . sue [enumerated defendants].\n\n15 U.S.C. § 77k(a).\n\n            Here, plaintiffs properly alleged that they acquired\n\nsecurities        pursuant       to    a       registration        statement,         and\n\ndefendants--which include the issuer and underwriters, as well as\n\nthe    directors    of       Nomura   Asset    and   signers       of   the   offering\n\ndocuments--are those enumerated in section 11.8                     Plaintiffs also\n\nalleged that misstatements or misleading statements were made and\n\nthat they were \"material,\" that is, that \"'there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood    that       a    reasonable      shareholder     would     consider      it\n\nimportant' to the investment decision.\"                 Milton v.

See 2 T. Hazen, The Law of Securities Regulation\n§ 7.3[3], at 218 & n.49 (6th ed. 2009).\n\n                                           -17-\n\f           One   qualification   is   important   to   understanding   the\n\ndistrict court's rulings.    Cautionary statements may \"negate any\n\nreasonable reliance,\" 2 Hazen, supra, § 7.3[1][B], at 216; but this\n\nexception, known as the \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine, normally\n\napplies only to \"forward-looking\" statements such as projections or\n\nforecasts and not to \"representation[s] of present fact.\"         Shaw v.\n\nDigital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1213 (1st Cir. 1996) (emphasis\n\nomitted), abrogated on other grounds by 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2); 2\n\nHazen, supra, § 7.3[1][B], at 215 (citing cases).\n\n           This brings us to the individual charges of false or\n\nmisleading statements and to the specific allegations of the\n\ncomplaint.    On this appeal, plaintiffs claim that three sets of\n\nallegations were adequately alleged: one relates to the lending\n\nguidelines, another to appraisal standards and a third to credit\n\nratings.     The district court disagreed in each case, and we\n\nconsider the adequacy of the allegations charge by charge.\n\n           The underwriting guidelines.     Plaintiffs first point to\n\na set of statements in the offering documents implying that the\n\nbanks that originated the mortgages used lending guidelines to\n\ndetermine borrowers' creditworthiness and ability to repay the\n\nloans.   For example, the prospectus supplements for the two trusts\n\nat issue stated that First National Bank of Nevada (\"FNBN\"), one of\n\nthe \"key\" loan originators for those trusts, used \"underwriting\n\nguidelines   [that]   are   primarily     intended     to   evaluate   the\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fprospective borrower's credit standing and ability to repay the\n\nloan, as well as the value and adequacy of the proposed mortgaged\n\nproperty as collateral.\"9\n\n          In fact, plaintiffs allege, FNBN \"routinely violated\" its\n\nlending guidelines and instead approved as many loans as possible,\n\neven \"scrub[bing]\" loan applications of potentially disqualifying\n\nmaterial. Indeed, plaintiffs allege that this was FNBN's \"business\n\nmodel,\" aimed at milling applications at high speed to generate\n\nprofits from the sale of such risky loans to others.         Thus,\n\nplaintiffs say, contrary to the registration statement, borrowers\n\ndid not \"demonstrate[] an established ability to repay indebtedness\n\nin a timely fashion\" and employment history was not \"verified.\"10\n\n          Admittedly, warnings in the offering documents state, for\n\nexample, that the \"underwriting standards . . . typically differ\n\nfrom, and are . . . generally less stringent than, the underwriting\n\nstandards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\"; that \"certain\n\n\n     9\n      The prospectus supplements also stated that \"FNBN employs or\ncontracts with underwriters to scrutinize the prospective\nborrower's credit profile\"; its guidelines \"are applied in a\nstandard procedure that is intended to comply with applicable\nfederal and state laws and regulations\"; \"the prospective borrower\nmust have a credit history that demonstrates an established ability\nto repay indebtedness in a timely fashion\"; and \"employment history\nis verified through written or telephonic communication.\"\n     10\n      Similar claims were made for another \"principal originator\"\nfor one of the two trusts, Metrocities Mortgage, LLC, but the basis\nfor such claims appears to be only that such claims were made\nagainst that company in other litigation. As we are here concerned\nonly with whether the claim is adequately supported as to some of\nthe mortgages, we need not pursue this issue further.\n\n                               -19-\n\fexceptions to the underwriting standards . . . are made in the\n\nevent that compensating factors are demonstrated by a prospective\n\nborrower\"; and that FNBN \"originates or purchases loans that have\n\nbeen originated under certain limited documentation programs\" that\n\n\"may not require income, employment or asset verification.\"\n\n          The district court ruled that, read together with such\n\nwarnings, the complained-of assurances were not materially false or\n\nmisleading, but we cannot agree.           Neither being \"less stringent\"\n\nthan Fannie Mae nor saying that exceptions occur when borrowers\n\ndemonstrate other \"compensating factors\" reveals what plaintiffs\n\nallege, namely, a wholesale abandonment of underwriting standards.11\n\nThat is true too of the warning that less verification may be\n\nemployed for \"certain limited documentation programs designed to\n\nstreamline the loan underwriting process.\"         Plaintiffs' allegation\n\nof wholesale abandonment may not be proved, but--if accepted at\n\nthis stage--it is enough to defeat dismissal.\n\n          Defendants   say   that    no     detailed   factual   support   is\n\nprovided for the allegation and that it is implausible.             Despite\n\nthe familiar generalization that evidence need not be pled at the\n\ncomplaint stage, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, courts increasingly\n\n     11\n      The same can be said about the warning that \"[c]ertain\n[m]ortgage [l]oans were underwritten to nonconforming underwriting\nstandards, which may result in losses or shortfalls to be incurred\non the [o]ffered [c]ertificates.\" Using \"nonconforming\" standards\nis different than having no standards; and this statement makes it\nseem as though only some (\"certain\") loans were underwritten under\nthese standards, leaving the impression that most other loans used\n\"conforming\" standards.\n\n                                    -20-\n\finsist that more specific facts be alleged where an allegation is\n\nconclusory, see Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 266, 274; and the same is\n\ntrue for implausibility, at least where the claim is considered as\n\na whole, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; see Arista Records LLC v. Doe 3,\n\n604 F.3d 110, 119-21 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n          \"Conclusory\" and \"implausible\" are matters of degree\n\nrather than sharp-edged categories.        Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949;\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.    However, the practices alleged in this\n\ncase are fairly specific and a number of lenders in the industry\n\nare widely understood to have engaged in such practices.            The\n\nharder problem is whether enough has been said in the complaint--\n\nbeyond conclusory assertions--to link such practices with specific\n\nlending banks that supplied the mortgages that underpinned the\n\ntrusts.   Similar complaints in other cases have cited to more\n\nsubstantial    sources,   including     statements   from   confidential\n\nwitnesses, former employees and internal e-mails.\n\n          This is a familiar problem: plaintiffs want discovery to\n\ndevelop such evidence, while courts are loath to license fishing\n\nexpeditions.   While this case presents a judgment call, the sharp\n\ndrop in the credit ratings after the sales and the specific\n\nallegations as to FNBN offer enough basis to warrant some initial\n\ndiscovery aimed at these precise allegations.        The district court\n\nis free to limit discovery stringently and to revisit the adequacy\n\nof the allegations thereafter and even before possible motions for\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fsummary judgment.            See, e.g., Miss. Pub. Emps.' Ret. Sys. v. Bos.\n\nSci. Corp., 523 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n               Appraisal practices. The complaint also alleges that the\n\noffering documents contained false statements relating to the\n\nmethods       used     to    appraise      the     property     values      of    potential\n\nborrowers--the         ratio        of   property    value    to    loan    being     a   key\n\nindicator of risk.            For example, the April 19, 2006, registration\n\nstatement       and    the     prospectus         supplements      stated    that    \"[a]ll\n\nappraisals\"          were    conducted       in    accordance      with     the    \"Uniform\n\nStandards of Professional Appraisal Practice\" (\"USPAP\").                            These in\n\nturn        require     that        appraisers       \"perform       assignments           with\n\nimpartiality, objectivity, and independence\" and make it unethical\n\nfor    appraisers,          among    other    things,    to     accept     an     assignment\n\ncontingent on reporting a predetermined result.\n\n               The complaint alleges in a single general statement that\n\nthe appraisals underlying the loans at issue here failed to comply\n\nwith USPAP requirements; but there is no allegation that any\n\nspecific bank that supplied mortgages to the trusts did exert undue\n\npressure, let alone that the pressure succeeded.                            The complaint\n\nfairly read is that many appraisers in the banking industry were\n\nsubject to such pressure.12                   So, unlike the lending standard\n\n\n       12\n      The complaint cites the testimony of Alan Hummel, the Chair\nof the Appraisal Institute, before the Senate Committee on Banking\nthat appraisers \"experience[d] systemic problems with coercion\" and\na 2007 survey showing that such pressure was widespread. How many\nsuccumbed and altered appraisals is not specified.\n\n                                             -22-\n\fallegation, the complaint is essentially a claim that other banks\n\nengaged in such practices, some of which probably distorted loans,\n\nand therefore this may have happened in this case.\n\n           On this basis, virtually every investor in mortgage-\n\nbacked securities could subject a multiplicity of defendants \"to\n\nthe most unrestrained of fishing expeditions.\" Gooley v. Mobil Oil\n\nCorp., 851 F.3d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988); see also DM Research,\n\nInc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nAccordingly,    we   agree   with   the    district    court   that   such   an\n\nallegation--amounting to the statement that others in the industry\n\nengaged   in   wrongful   pressure--is      not   enough.      Several   other\n\ndistrict courts have reached precisely this conclusion.13\n\n           Investment ratings. The prospectus supplements set forth\n\nratings that Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Inc. (\"S&P\") or\n\nMoody's Investor Services, Inc. (\"Moody's\") had assigned to the\n\ncertificates or stated that the certificates would not be offered\n\nunless they received an \"investment grade\" rating from S&P (AAA\n\nthrough BBB) or Moody's (Aaa through Baa3).

Sommer, Federal\nSecurities Act of 1933 § 9.02[12][d], at 9-24 (rev. ed. 2010)\n(underwriters, directors, officers and issuers can be held liable\nfor statements of experts included in registration statements).\n\n                                  -24-\n\fhave been using better methods and data. Defendants are not liable\n\nunder the securities laws when their opinions, or those they\n\nreported, were honestly held when formed but simply turn out later\n\nto be inaccurate; nor are they liable only because they could have\n\nformed \"better\" opinions.    See Boilermakers, 2010 WL 3815796, at\n\n*7.   A majority of district courts that have considered the issue\n\nhave dismissed similar claims, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed one\n\nsuch dismissal.15\n\n           In addition to claiming that the ratings were faulty, the\n\ncomplaint also alleges that the ratings agencies produced high\n\nratings aimed at keeping business, and it quotes individuals at the\n\nrating companies to support that proposition and to suggest that\n\nsome inside the company thought that ratings were skewed.16    But,\n\ntellingly, the complaint stops short of alleging expressly that the\n\nleadership of S&P or Moody's believed that their companies' ratings\n\nwere false or were unsupported by models that generally captured\n\nthe quality of the securities being rated.\n\n\n      15\n      E.g., J & R Mktg., SEP v. Gen. Motors Corp., 549 F.3d 384,\n392-93 (6th Cir. 2008); Boilermakers, 2010 WL 3815796, at *7 (\"The\nmere fact that the ratings would have been different under a\ndifferent methodology is insufficient to state a claim.\"); IndyMac,\n718 F. Supp. 2d at 511-12; Tsereteli, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 395. But\nsee Wells Fargo, 712 F. Supp. 2d at 973.\n      16\n      The strongest examples are from an S&P managing director now\nadmitting that S&P intentionally inflated ratings and that he \"knew\nit was wrong at the time\" but did it because \"[i]t was either that\nor skip the business\" and from a CEO of Moody's reportedly saying\nto his board in 2007 that Moody's was pressured to rate higher and\nthat sometimes they \"drink the kool-aid.\"\n\n                                -25-\n\f          The line is admittedly a fine one, but the ratings--\n\ninherently opinions and not warranties against error, J & R Mktg.,\n\n549 F.3d at 392-93--were accurately reported by defendants and\n\nnothing more is required so long as the ratings were honestly made,\n\nhad some basis, and did not omit critical information.    That a high\n\nrating may be mistaken, a rater negligent in the model employed or\n\nthe rating company interested in securing more business may be\n\ntrue, but it does not make the report of the rating false or\n\nmisleading.    If the purchaser wants absolute protection against\n\nerrors of opinion, the answer is insurance rather than lawsuits.\n\n          As sections 11 and 12 are structured, there is liability\n\nwithout fault even for those who merely report the statements or\n\nopinions of others; under section 11 this liability for the issuer\n\nis absolute; for other defendants (including the issuer under\n\nsection 12), a defense is available for reporting statements of\n\nothers if due diligence was exercised. See 15 U.S.C §§ 77k(a)-(b),\n\n77l(a)(2).17   Either way, the absence of a scienter element may\n\nsuggest special caution before classifying an accurate report of a\n\nthird-party    opinion     as   \"misleading\"   based     on   implied\n\nrepresentations about subjective intent or qualifications known\n\nonly to the third party.\n\n\n     17\n      See 2 Sommer, supra, § 9.02[12][d], at 9-24; see also In re\nWorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 628, 660-61 (S.D.N.Y.\n2004) (underwriters can be liable for false and misleading public\nfilings made by issuer and accountants that were incorporated into\nregistration statement).\n\n                                 -26-\n\f            Seller    or     solicitor    allegations.           Section       12(a)(2)\n\npermits a plaintiff to sue only a defendant who either sold its own\n\nsecurity to the plaintiff or (for financial gain) successfully\n\nsolicited the sale of that security to the plaintiff.                   Pinter, 486\n\nU.S.   at   642-47,    650    &   n.21.        The    district    court    dismissed\n\nplaintiffs' section 12(a)(2) claims, concluding that they did not\n\nadequately allege that defendants sold the certificates to the\n\nplaintiffs or solicited the sales. This was apparently because the\n\ncomplaint used a more ambiguous phrase--that plaintiffs \"acquired\n\nthe [c]ertificates pursuant and/or traceable to\" the offering\n\ndocuments--found insufficient by a number of courts.                      E.g., Pub.\n\nEmps.' Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., 714 F. Supp.\n\n2d 475, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Wells Fargo, 712 F. Supp. 2d at 966.\n\n            But     the     complaint     also        alleged    that     plaintiffs\n\n\"acquired . . . [c]ertificates from defendant Nomura Securities\"\n\nand that the \"[d]efendants promoted and sold the [c]ertificates to\n\n[the p]laintiffs and other members of the [c]lass\" (emphasis\n\nadded); these allegations are sufficient to state a claim under\n\nsection 12(a)(2) so long as material misstatements or misleading\n\nomissions     are    alleged.       The   district        court's   dismissal       of\n\nplaintiffs'       section    12(a)(2)     claims       for   failure      to    allege\n\ndefendants' requisite connections with the sale was in error.\n\n            Control person liability.                Finally, the district court\n\ndismissed plaintiffs' section 15 \"control person\" liability claims\n\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fbecause it held that plaintiffs failed to state a violation of the\n\nsecurities laws to begin with.       Section 15 creates liability for\n\nany individual or entity that \"controls any person liable\" under\n\nsections 11 or 12.   15 U.S.C. § 77o; see Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1201 n.2.\n\nBecause we hold that plaintiffs adequately stated some claims under\n\nsections 11 and 12(a)(2), we also hold that the district court's\n\ndismissal of plaintiffs' section 15 claim was in error.         Given the\n\n\"highly factual nature\" of the control person inquiry, resolving\n\nthat issue on a motion to dismiss is often inappropriate.         2 Hazen,\n\nsupra, § 7.12[2], at 343 n.38.\n\n          We    affirm   the   dismissal   of   all   claims   based   upon\n\npurchases of the AR1, AR2, AF2, AR3, AR4 and WF1 trusts and all\n\ndefendants including those six trusts implicated only as to their\n\ncertificates.    As to claims against the AF1 and AP1 trusts and\n\nother remaining defendants, we affirm the dismissal of all claims\n\nsave those relating to the statements regarding the lending banks'\n\nunderwriting practices but vacate the dismissal of the latter\n\nclaims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\ndecision. Each party will bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\f",

The lawsuit sought redress for losses suffered when plaintiffs acquired trust certificates representing mortgage-backed securities. The background facts are largely undisputed.</p>\n<p>The lead defendant, Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation (\"Nomura Asset\"), played the organizing role in the creation of the securities at issue in this case. As depositor, it acquired mortgages from various banks and transferred them to the eight trusts, all of which are separate legal entities. Each trust pooled the mortgages acquired by it and, with Nomura Asset, issued trust certificates representing interests in that trust. Then Nomura Asset and the trusts worked with underwriters to sell the certificates to investors.</p>\n<p>The certificates constitute securities under the federal securities laws, and to permit their initial sale, a registration statement was required, disclosing information about the securities being offered. One registration statement, filed on July 22, 2005, covered three trusts (2006-AP1, 2006-AR1, 2006-AR2); the other, filed on April 19, 2006, covered the remaining five (2006-AF1, 2006-AF2, 2006-AR3, 2006-AR4, 2006-WF1). These were \"shelf registrations,\" <i>see</i> 17 C.F.R. § 230.415(a) (2010), signaling an intent to offer securities in the future and containing certain information about Nomura Asset, the trusts and the securities.</p>\n<p>The registration statements were not themselves offerings and did not become effective until Nomura Asset and the trusts updated them by filing prospectus supplements that described the details of the offering for each trust. The registration statements and prospectus supplements (collectively, \"offering documents\") explain in detail the characteristics of the mortgages that Nomura Asset acquired and transferred to each trust. The federal securities laws, yet to be discussed, impose liability for false or misleading statements causing harm to purchasers.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiffs bought trust certificates representing interests in two of the eight trusts; one trust (AP1 trust) was covered by the earlier registration statement and a September 27, 2005, prospectus supplement; the other (AF1 trust), by the later of the two registration statements and a May 25, 2006, prospectus supplement. One of the three plaintiffs bought certificates in the AF1 trust, a second in the AP1 trust and the third in both trusts. Thereafter, on November 13, 2007, Moody's downgraded the rating of all of the certificates for all eight trusts and the certificates are now worth much less than what plaintiffs originally paid for them. This lawsuit followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>On January 31, 2008, one of the three union funds filed suit in state court, asserting violations of sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k(a), 77<i>l</i> (a)(2), 77<i>o</i> (2006). Section 11 imposes liability for false or misleading statements contained in a registration statement, <i>id.</i> § 77k(a); section 12(a)(2) imposes similar liability on sellers who make such statements in a prospectus or oral communication, <i>id.</i> § 77<i>l</i>(a)(2). Section 15 imposes liability on one who \"controls any person liable\" under sections 11 or 12. <i>Id.</i> § 77<i>o.</i></p>\n<p>The case was removed to federal district court, the other funds entered as plaintiffs and ultimately a joint amended complaint was filed listing as defendants Nomura Asset, the eight trusts, the trusts' underwriters and five officers and directors of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*767</span> Nomura Asset.<sup>[2]</sup> The gravamen of the complaint is that the offering documents contained false or misleading statements, and as a result plaintiffs purchased securities whose true value when purchased was less than what was paid for them. The suit was cast as a class action comprised of purchasers of the certificates of the eight trusts covered by the two registration statements.</p>\n<p>Defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On September 30, 2009, the district court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and entered judgment. Claims related to the trusts whose certificates had been purchased by none of the named plaintiffs were dismissed for lack of Article III standing; claims relating to the other two trusts were dismissed on statutory grounds; and no class was ever certified. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p><i>Jurisdiction.</i> At the outset, plaintiffs say that the original action brought in state court may have been improperly removed and that the district court may thus have lacked subject matter jurisdiction; although plaintiffs did not contest jurisdiction until they lost the case in the district court, lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be noticed at any time and cannot be waived. <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 93-94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). But we conclude that any flaw in the removal was not one of subject matter jurisdiction and therefore has been waived or forfeited for lack of a timely objection. 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) (2006) (requiring objection within 30 days of removal).</p>\n<p>Removal is ordinarily permitted in civil actions where the same case could originally have been brought in federal court \"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). One exceptionsection 22 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)is that \"no case arising under [the Securities Act] and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.\" However, <i>assuming</i> that this limitation applied,<sup>[3]</sup> we conclude that section 22's limitation would not be one of subject matter jurisdiction but merely an advantage that a plaintiff could forfeit by failure to make timely objection.</p>\n<p>There are some casual references in reported circuit-court decisions to section 22 as a limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, <i>e.g., </i><i>Emrich v. Touche Ross &amp; Co.,</i> 846 F.2d 1190, 1197-98 (9th Cir.1988) (but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*768</span> the objection was made within 30 days, so that conclusion was dictum); <i>Westinghouse Credit Corp. v. Thompson,</i> 987 F.2d 682, 683 (10th Cir.1993) (but the remand order was unreviewable whatever the defect); yet a larger number of circuits have held that similarly phrased anti-removal provisions do not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Civil suits asserting claims under the Securities Act are within the \"arising under\" clause of Article III and can easily be brought as original actions in federal court. 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a). Although expressed as a bar on removal of such cases from state court, section 22(a)'s aim is not to preclude hearing such cases in federal court but instead to \"favor[] plaintiffs' choice of forum.\" <i>Pinto v. Maremont Corp.,</i> 326 F.Supp. 165, 167 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y. 1971); <i>see</i> Cook, <i>Recrafting the Jurisdictional Framework for Private Rights of Action Under the Federal Securities Laws,</i> 55 Am. U. L. Rev. 621, 632-34 (2006).</p>\n<p>Given that federal courts are otherwise competent to address federal securities claims and do so all the time, it makes far more sense to view section 22 as creating a waivable right to insist on non-removal. That course achieves the statute's aim to protect the plaintiff's preference for a state forum, but it prevents the mischief of allowing a party to sit on an objection, raising it only if and when the objector is dissatisfied with the result. <i>Cf.</i> 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; J. Steinman, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3739, at 817-18 (4th ed. 2009) (limiting removal objections to thirty-day period prevents use of a defect as insurance against unfavorable developments).</p>\n<p><i>Standing.</i> The more difficult threshold question presented by the appeal is whether plaintiffs can pursue claims, to the extent claims may be stated, based on offerings in which they did not participate and against trusts whose certificates they did not purchase. This issue, styled by defendants primarily as one of Article III standing and secondarily as a standing issue under the Securities Act, was resolved in defendants' favor by the district court. The issue looks straightforward and one would expect it to be well settled; neither assumption is entirely true.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the named plaintiffs have no claim <i>on their own behalf</i> based on trust certificates that they did not buy;<sup>[5]</sup> and they bought no certificates issued by six of the defendant trusts. To the extent claims exist based on such purchases, they belong to the actual purchasers. Since a requisite of an ordinary case or controversy is an injury to the plaintiff traceable to the defendant, <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), it might follow that there is also no case or controversy between the named plaintiffs and the trusts from which they made no purchases. Alas, the matter is not so simple.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*769</span> In a properly certified class action, the named plaintiffs regularly litigate not only their own claims but also claims of other class members based on transactions in which the named plaintiffs played no part. Yet, here certain defendants, including six of the eight trusts named as defendants, are not liable to the named plaintiffs on <i>any</i> claims. In these circumstances older cases, including a decision of this court, have refused to allow the case to proceedwhether as a class action or notagainst defendants not implicated in any of the wrongs done to the named plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Barry v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co.,</i> 555 F.2d 3 (1st Cir. 1977), <i>aff'd,</i> 438 U.S. 531, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 57 L.Ed.2d 932 (1978), Rhode Island physicians and patients sought to bring a class action fraud claim on behalf of all physicians and patients in the state against four insurance companies for the sale of certain insurance policies. <i>Id.</i> at 5, 13. Each of the insurance companies had almost certainly sold such policies to <i>some</i> members of the class, but none of the <i>named plaintiffs</i> ever bought that type of policy from two of the companies. The district court declined to allow claims against the latter two companies for the sale of those policies and we held there was \"no error in the district court's decision to adhere strictly to the traditional [standing] rules.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13; <i>see also </i><i>Haas v. Pittsburgh Nat'l Bank,</i> 526 F.2d 1083, 1095-96 &amp; n. 18 (3d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p>How far <i>Barry</i> extends today may be debatable. Although its discussion of the issue was terse and not the main focus of the decision, its approach had support not only from sister circuit cases but from statements from the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Barry,</i> 555 F.2d at 13. And several times since <i>Barry</i> the Supreme Court used Article III concepts in refusing to permit class claims to extend to those suffering injuries materially different than those suffered by the named plaintiffs. <i>Lewis v. Casey,</i> 518 U.S. 343, 346-49, 358 &amp; n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <i>Blum v. Yaretsky,</i> 457 U.S. 991, 999-1002, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982).<sup>[6]</sup> For example, <i>Blum</i> stated:</p>\n<blockquote>It is axiomatic that the judicial power conferred by Art. III may not be exercised unless the plaintiff shows \"that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of some putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.\". . . It is not enough that the conduct of which the plaintiff complains will injure <i>someone.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>457 U.S. at 999, 102 S.Ct. 2777 (quoting <i>Gladstone, Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood,</i> 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979)).</p>\n<p>But the Supreme Court has not been consistent. In <i>Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.,</i> 527 U.S. 815, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999), and <i>Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor,</i> 521 U.S. 591, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997), the Supreme Court ruled that no class should be certified, but in doing so, it bypassed objections that some settling parties lacked standing, saying that the class certification issues were \"`logically antecedent' to Article III concerns,\" <i>Ortiz,</i> 527 U.S. at 831, 119 S.Ct. 2295 (quoting <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 612, 117 S.Ct. 2231). And in <i>Gratz v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 244, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*770</span> L.Ed.2d 257 (2003), the Court allowed the named class plaintiff to challenge admissions practices as to college freshmen even though his status would have been that of a transfer student subject to different rules. <i>Id.</i> at 263-65, 123 S.Ct. 2411.</p>\n<p>Further, several circuits have cut themselves loose from a strict requirement that, in a plaintiff class action, no defendant may be sued unless a named plaintiff has a counterpart claim against that defendant. Arguing that the class action should be a flexible instrument, these courts conclude that the class action should embrace defendants against whom no named plaintiff has a claim so long as the claims are essentially of the same character as the claim against a properly named defendant, and that the sorting out of this issue should be left to Rule 23 criteria rather than by use of standing concepts focusing on named plaintiffs.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>There is no reason to inventory stray Supreme Court quotations that can be found on both sides; nor is there a single recent holding by the Court that with perfect clarity resolves the issue directly before us. Indeed, Rule 23 criteria can still be used as a required tool for shaping the scope of a class action without abandoning the notion that Article III creates some outer limit based on the incentives of the named plaintiffs to adequately litigate issues of importance to them. <i>See </i><i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962) (plaintiffs need \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure . . . concrete adverseness\").</p>\n<p>For the present, <i>Barry</i>however terse its treatmentis on our books; and we are inclined (and perhaps required) to follow its leadwith a qualification that does not affect the outcome in this case. The qualification, on which we reserve judgment, is one where the claims of the named plaintiffs necessarily give them not just their lawyersessentially the same incentive to litigate the counterpart claims of the class members because the establishment of the named plaintiffs' claims necessarily establishes those of other class members. The matter is one of identity of issues not in the abstract but at a ground floor level. In such a case, which might include the kind of claims that were present in <i>Payton,</i> 308 F.3d at 680, and <i>Fallick,</i> 162 F.3d at 423, the substance of the Article III concern may vanish even if in form it might seem to persist.</p>\n<p>Turning back to our own situationclaims based on mortgage-backed securitiesmost district courts have continued to hold that named plaintiffs must themselves possess claims against each defendant. <i>E.g., </i><i>In re Salomon Smith Barney Mut. Fund Fees Litig.,</i> 441 F.Supp.2d 579, 604-08 (S.D.N.Y.2006); <i>In re Eaton Vance Corp. Sec. Litig.,</i> 220 F.R.D. 162, 166-69 (D.Mass.2004). Indeed, one court recently found that</p>\n<blockquote>[e]very court to address the issue in a [mortgage-backed security] class action has concluded that a plaintiff lacks standing under . . . Article III . . . to represent the interests of investors in [mortgage-backed securities] offerings in which the [named] plaintiffs did not themselves buy.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*771</span> <i>Me. State Ret. Sys. v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.,</i> 722 F.Supp.2d 1157, 1163 (C.D.Cal. 2010). Interestingly, a handful of district court cases have allowed securities claims to proceed in situations that may fit the possible exception we have outlined above. <i>E.g., In re Am. Int'l Grp., Inc. 2008 Sec. Litig.,</i> 741 F.Supp.2d 511, 537-39, 2010 WL 3768146, at *22 (S.D.N.Y.2010).</p>\n<p>In our case, as in others involving mortgage-backed securities, the necessary identity of issues and alignment of incentives is not present so far as the claims involve sales of certificates in the six trusts. Each trust is backed by loans from a different mix of banks; no named plaintiff has a significant interest in establishing wrongdoing by the particular group of banks that financed a trust from which the named plaintiffs made no purchases. Thus, the claims related to the six trusts from which the named plaintiffs never purchased securities were properly dismissed, as were the six trusts and defendants connected to only those six trusts.</p>\n<p>Although Nomura Asset is a common defendant with respect to all eight of the trusts, claims against it as well fail so far as they are based on the six trusts whose certificates were purchased by no named plaintiff. Although Nomura Asset is a properly named defendant, the named plaintiffs have no stake in establishing liability as to misconduct involving the sales of those certificates. In the Supreme Court's words: \"Nor does a plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind possess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another kind, although similar, to which he has not been subject.\" <i>Blum,</i> 457 U.S. at 999, 102 S.Ct. 2777; <i>see also </i><i>Lewis,</i> 518 U.S. at 358 n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p><i>Adequacy of claims.</i> The district court held that on the face of the complaint, <i>no</i> claims were sufficiently stated. We review that ruling <i>de novo,</i> accepting as true all well-pled facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs. <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> 597 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir.2010) (en banc). But, while this much is clear, the usual difficulty of parsing and evaluating misrepresentation claims at the complaint stage in securities cases is further complicated by recent case law tightening the sieve through which a well-pled complaint must pass.</p>\n<p>To state a claim, the complaint must \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to `state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,'\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)); \"`naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement'\" need not be accepted, <i>Maldonado v. Fontanes,</i> 568 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1949); and \"[i]f the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager, vague, or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal,\" <i>Tambone,</i> 597 F.3d at 442.</p>\n<p>The district court found that of plaintiffs' main efforts to assert adequate claims, all three failed. The statute provides the blueprint against which a claim must be measured and we start by outlining the requirements of section 11, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>In case any part of the registration statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring such security . . . may . . . sue [enumerated defendants].</blockquote>\n<p>15 U.S.C. § 77k(a).</p>\n<p>Here, plaintiffs properly alleged that they acquired securities pursuant to a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*772</span> registration statement, and defendants which include the issuer and underwriters, as well as the directors of Nomura Asset and signers of the offering documents are those enumerated in section 11.<sup>[8]</sup> Plaintiffs also alleged that misstatements or misleading statements were made and that they were \"material,\" that is, that \"`there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important' to the investment decision.\" <i>Milton v. Van Dorn Co.,</i> 961 F.2d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1992) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <i>Basic, Inc. v. Levinson,</i> 485 U.S. 224, 231, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988)).</p>\n<p>One qualification is important to understanding the district court's rulings. Cautionary statements may \"negate any reasonable reliance,\" 2 Hazen, <i>supra,</i> § 7.3[1][B], at 216; but this exception, known as the \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine, normally applies only to \"forward-looking\" statements such as projections or forecasts and not to \"representation[s] of present fact.\" <i>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 1194, 1213 (1st Cir.1996) (emphasis omitted), <i>abrogated on other grounds by</i> 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2); 2 Hazen, <i>supra,</i> § 7.3[1][B], at 215 (citing cases).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the individual charges of false or misleading statements and to the specific allegations of the complaint. On this appeal, plaintiffs claim that three sets of allegations were adequately alleged: one relates to the lending guidelines, another to appraisal standards and a third to credit ratings. The district court disagreed in each case, and we consider the adequacy of the allegations charge by charge.</p>\n<p><i>The underwriting guidelines.</i> Plaintiffs first point to a set of statements in the offering documents implying that the banks that originated the mortgages used lending guidelines to determine borrowers' creditworthiness and ability to repay the loans. For example, the prospectus supplements for the two trusts at issue stated that First National Bank of Nevada (\"FNBN\"), one of the \"key\" loan originators for those trusts, used \"underwriting guidelines [that] are primarily intended to evaluate the prospective borrower's credit standing and ability to repay the loan, as well as the value and adequacy of the proposed mortgaged property as collateral.\"<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, plaintiffs allege, FNBN \"routinely violated\" its lending guidelines and instead approved as many loans as possible, even \"scrub[bing]\" loan applications of potentially disqualifying material. Indeed, plaintiffs allege that this was FNBN's \"business model,\" aimed at milling applications at high speed to generate profits from the sale of such risky loans to others. Thus, plaintiffs say, contrary to the registration statement, borrowers did not \"demonstrate[] an established ability to repay <span class=\"star-pagination\">*773</span> indebtedness in a timely fashion\" and employment history was not \"verified.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Admittedly, warnings in the offering documents state, for example, that the \"underwriting standards . . . typically differ from, and are . . . generally less stringent than, the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\"; that \"certain exceptions to the underwriting standards . . . are made in the event that compensating factors are demonstrated by a prospective borrower\"; and that FNBN \"originates or purchases loans that have been originated under certain limited documentation programs\" that \"may not require income, employment or asset verification.\"</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that, read together with such warnings, the complained-of assurances were not materially false or misleading, but we cannot agree. Neither being \"less stringent\" than Fannie Mae nor saying that exceptions occur when borrowers demonstrate other \"compensating factors\" reveals what plaintiffs allege, namely, a wholesale abandonment of underwriting standards.<sup>[11]</sup> That is true too of the warning that less verification may be employed for \"certain limited documentation programs designed to streamline the loan underwriting process.\" Plaintiffs' allegation of wholesale abandonment may not be proved, butif accepted at this stageit is enough to defeat dismissal.</p>\n<p>Defendants say that no detailed factual support is provided for the allegation and that it is implausible. Despite the familiar generalization that evidence need not be pled at the complaint stage, <i>see </i><i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, courts increasingly insist that more specific facts be alleged where an allegation is conclusory, <i>see </i><i>Maldonado,</i> 568 F.3d at 266, 274; and the same is true for implausibility, at least where the claim is considered as a whole, <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <i>see </i><i>Arista Records LLC v. Doe 3,</i> 604 F.3d 110, 119-21 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>\"Conclusory\" and \"implausible\" are matters of degree rather than sharp-edged categories. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1949; <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. However, the practices alleged in this case are fairly specific and a number of lenders in the industry are widely understood to have engaged in such practices. The harder problem is whether enough has been said in the complaintbeyond conclusory assertionsto link such practices with specific lending banks that supplied the mortgages that underpinned the trusts. Similar complaints in other cases have cited to more substantial sources, including statements from confidential witnesses, former employees and internal e-mails.</p>\n<p>This is a familiar problem: plaintiffs want discovery to develop such evidence, while courts are loath to license fishing expeditions. While this case presents a judgment call, the sharp drop in the credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> ratings after the sales and the <i>specific</i> allegations as to FNBN offer enough basis to warrant some initial discovery aimed at these precise allegations. The district court is free to limit discovery stringently and to revisit the adequacy of the allegations thereafter and even before possible motions for summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Miss. Pub. Emps.' Ret. Sys. v. Bos. Sci. Corp.,</i> 523 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p><i>Appraisal practices.</i> The complaint also alleges that the offering documents contained false statements relating to the methods used to appraise the property values of potential borrowersthe ratio of property value to loan being a key indicator of risk. For example, the April 19, 2006, registration statement and the prospectus supplements stated that \"[a]ll appraisals\" were conducted in accordance with the \"Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice\" (\"USPAP\"). These in turn require that appraisers \"perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence\" and make it unethical for appraisers, among other things, to accept an assignment contingent on reporting a predetermined result.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges in a single general statement that the appraisals underlying the loans at issue here failed to comply with USPAP requirements; but there is no allegation that any specific bank that supplied mortgages to the trusts did exert undue pressure, let alone that the pressure succeeded. The complaint fairly read is that many appraisers in the banking industry were subject to such pressure.<sup>[12]</sup> So, unlike the lending standard allegation, the complaint is essentially a claim that other banks engaged in such practices, some of which probably distorted loans, and therefore this may have happened in this case.</p>\n<p>On this basis, virtually <i>every</i> investor in mortgage-backed securities could subject a multiplicity of defendants \"to the most unrestrained of fishing expeditions.\" <i>Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also </i><i>DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists,</i> 170 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.1999). Accordingly, we agree with the district court that such an allegation amounting to the statement that others in the industry engaged in wrongful pressureis not enough. Several other district courts have reached precisely this conclusion.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Investment ratings.</i> The prospectus supplements set forth ratings that Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Services, Inc. (\"S &amp; P\") or Moody's Investor Services, Inc. (\"Moody's\") had assigned to the certificates or stated that the certificates would not be offered unless they received an \"investment grade\" rating from S &amp; P (AAA through BBB) or Moody's (Aaa through Baa3). There is no claim that the ratings given were misreported or that the \"unless\" condition was not met. Rather, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> plaintiffs say that these ratings were <i>misleading,</i> primarily because they were based on \"outdated models, lowered ratings criteria, and inaccurate loan information.\"</p>\n<p>The ratings are <i>opinions</i> purportedly expressing the agencies' professional judgment about the value and prospects of the certificates. <i>See </i><i>In re Credit Suisse First Bos. Corp.,</i> 431 F.3d 36, 46-47 (1st Cir.2005), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.,</i> 551 U.S. 308, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). An opinion may still be misleading if it does not represent the actual belief of the person expressing the opinion, lacks any basis or knowingly omits undisclosed facts tending seriously to undermine the accuracy of the statement. <i>Id.</i> at 47; <i>accord </i><i>In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig.,</i> 886 F.2d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 1989), <i>cert. denied,</i> 496 U.S. 943, 110 S.Ct. 3229, 110 L.Ed.2d 676 (1990). Liability may on this theory also extend to one who accurately described the opinion.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The complaint includes acknowledgments from S &amp; P and Moody's executives conceding, in hindsight, that the models and data that the rating agencies were using were deficient. But the ratings were not false or misleading because rating agencies should have been using better methods and data. Defendants are not liable under the securities laws when their opinions, or those they reported, were honestly held when formed but simply turn out later to be inaccurate; nor are they liable only because they could have formed \"better\" opinions. <i>See Boilermakers,</i> ___ F.Supp.2d at ___, 2010 WL 3815796, at *7. A majority of district courts that have considered the issue have dismissed similar claims, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed one such dismissal.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to claiming that the ratings were faulty, the complaint also alleges that the ratings agencies produced high ratings aimed at keeping business, and it quotes individuals at the rating companies to support that proposition and to suggest that some inside the company thought that ratings were skewed.<sup>[16]</sup> But, tellingly, the complaint stops short of alleging expressly that the leadership of S &amp; P or Moody's believed that their companies' ratings were false or were unsupported by models that generally captured the quality of the securities being rated.</p>\n<p>The line is admittedly a fine one, but the ratingsinherently opinions and not warranties against error, <i>J &amp; R Mktg.,</i> 549 F.3d at 392-93were accurately reported by defendants and nothing more is required so long as the ratings were honestly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> made, had some basis, and did not omit critical information. That a high rating may be mistaken, a rater negligent in the model employed or the rating company interested in securing more business may be true, but it does not make the report of the rating false or misleading. If the purchaser wants absolute protection against errors of opinion, the answer is insurance rather than lawsuits.</p>\n<p>As sections 11 and 12 are structured, there is liability without fault even for those who merely report the statements or opinions of others; under section 11 this liability for the issuer is absolute; for other defendants (including the issuer under section 12), a defense is available for reporting statements of others if due diligence was exercised. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k(a)-(b), 77<i>l</i>(a)(2).<sup>[17]</sup> Either way, the absence of a scienter element may suggest special caution before classifying an accurate report of a third-party opinion as \"misleading\" based on implied representations about subjective intent or qualifications known only to the third party.</p>\n<p><i>Seller or solicitor allegations.</i> Section 12(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to sue only a defendant who either sold its own security to the plaintiff or (for financial gain) successfully solicited the sale of that security to the plaintiff. <i>Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 642-47, 650 &amp; n. 21, 108 S.Ct. 2063. The district court dismissed plaintiffs' section 12(a)(2) claims, concluding that they did not adequately allege that defendants sold the certificates to the plaintiffs or solicited the sales. This was apparently because the complaint used a more ambiguous phrasethat plaintiffs \"acquired the [c]ertificates pursuant and/or traceable to\" the offering documentsfound insufficient by a number of courts. <i>E.g., </i><i>Pub. Emps.' Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.,</i> 714 F.Supp.2d 475, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); <i>Wells Fargo,</i> 712 F.Supp.2d at 966.</p>\n<p>But the complaint also alleged that plaintiffs \"acquired . . . [c]ertificates <i>from</i> defendant Nomura Securities\" and that the \"[d]efendants <i>promoted and sold</i> the [c]ertificates <i>to</i> [the p]laintiffs and other members of the [c]lass\" (emphasis added); these allegations are sufficient to state a claim under section 12(a)(2) so long as material misstatements or misleading omissions are alleged. The district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' section 12(a)(2) claims for failure to allege defendants' requisite connections with the sale was in error.</p>\n<p><i>Control person liability.</i> Finally, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' section 15 \"control person\" liability claims because it held that plaintiffs failed to state a violation of the securities laws to begin with. Section 15 creates liability for any individual or entity that \"controls any person liable\" under sections 11 or 12. 15 U.S.C. § 77<i>o; see </i><i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1201 n. 2. Because we hold that plaintiffs adequately stated some claims under sections 11 and 12(a)(2), we also hold that the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' section 15 claim was in error. Given the \"highly factual nature\" of the control person inquiry, resolving that issue on a motion to dismiss is often inappropriate. 2 Hazen, <i>supra,</i> § 7.12[2], at 343 n. 38.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of all claims based upon purchases of the AR1, AR2, AF2, AR3, AR4 and WF1 trusts and all defendants including those six trusts implicated only as to their certificates. As to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> claims against the AF1 and AP1 trusts and other remaining defendants, we <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of all claims save those relating to the statements regarding the lending banks' underwriting practices but <i>vacate</i> the dismissal of the latter claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Each party will bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Plumbers' Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund (\"Plumbers' Fund\"), Plumbers' &amp; Pipe-fitters' Welfare Educational Fund (\"Plumbers' &amp; Pipefitters' Fund\") and the NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund (\"NECA-IBEW Fund\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Nomura Securities International, Inc.

The lawsuit sought redress for losses suffered when plaintiffs acquired trust certificates representing mortgage-backed securities. The background facts are largely undisputed.</p>\n<p>The lead defendant, Nomura Asset Acceptance Corporation (\"Nomura Asset\"), played the organizing role in the creation of the securities at issue in this case. As depositor, it acquired mortgages from various banks and transferred them to the eight trusts, all of which are separate legal entities. Each trust pooled the mortgages acquired by it and, with Nomura Asset, issued trust certificates representing interests in that trust. Then Nomura Asset and the trusts worked with underwriters to sell the certificates to investors.</p>\n<p>The certificates constitute securities under the federal securities laws, and to permit their initial sale, a registration statement was required, disclosing information about the securities being offered. One registration statement, filed on July 22, 2005, covered three trusts (2006-AP1, 2006-AR1, 2006-AR2); the other, filed on April 19, 2006, covered the remaining five (2006-AF1, 2006-AF2, 2006-AR3, 2006-AR4, 2006-WF1). These were \"shelf registrations,\" <i>see</i> 17 C.F.R. § 230.415(a) (2010), signaling an intent to offer securities in the future and containing certain information about Nomura Asset, the trusts and the securities.</p>\n<p>The registration statements were not themselves offerings and did not become effective until Nomura Asset and the trusts updated them by filing prospectus supplements that described the details of the offering for each trust. The registration statements and prospectus supplements (collectively, \"offering documents\") explain in detail the characteristics of the mortgages that Nomura Asset acquired and transferred to each trust. The federal securities laws, yet to be discussed, impose liability for false or misleading statements causing harm to purchasers.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiffs bought trust certificates representing interests in two of the eight trusts; one trust (AP1 trust) was covered by the earlier registration statement and a September 27, 2005, prospectus supplement; the other (AF1 trust), by the later of the two registration statements and a May 25, 2006, prospectus supplement. One of the three plaintiffs bought certificates in the AF1 trust, a second in the AP1 trust and the third in both trusts. Thereafter, on November 13, 2007, Moody's downgraded the rating of all of the certificates for all eight trusts and the certificates are now worth much less than what plaintiffs originally paid for them. This lawsuit followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>On January 31, 2008, one of the three union funds filed suit in state court, asserting violations of sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k(a), 77<i>l</i> (a)(2), 77<i>o</i> (2006). Section 11 imposes liability for false or misleading statements contained in a registration statement, <i>id.</i> § 77k(a); section 12(a)(2) imposes similar liability on sellers who make such statements in a prospectus or oral communication, <i>id.</i> § 77<i>l</i>(a)(2). Section 15 imposes liability on one who \"controls any person liable\" under sections 11 or 12. <i>Id.</i> § 77<i>o.</i></p>\n<p>The case was removed to federal district court, the other funds entered as plaintiffs and ultimately a joint amended complaint was filed listing as defendants Nomura Asset, the eight trusts, the trusts' underwriters and five officers and directors of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*767</span> Nomura Asset.<sup>[2]</sup> The gravamen of the complaint is that the offering documents contained false or misleading statements, and as a result plaintiffs purchased securities whose true value when purchased was less than what was paid for them. The suit was cast as a class action comprised of purchasers of the certificates of the eight trusts covered by the two registration statements.</p>\n<p>Defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On September 30, 2009, the district court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and entered judgment. Claims related to the trusts whose certificates had been purchased by none of the named plaintiffs were dismissed for lack of Article III standing; claims relating to the other two trusts were dismissed on statutory grounds; and no class was ever certified. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p><i>Jurisdiction.</i> At the outset, plaintiffs say that the original action brought in state court may have been improperly removed and that the district court may thus have lacked subject matter jurisdiction; although plaintiffs did not contest jurisdiction until they lost the case in the district court, lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be noticed at any time and cannot be waived. <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span> (1998). But we conclude that any flaw in the removal was not one of subject matter jurisdiction and therefore has been waived or forfeited for lack of a timely objection. 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) (2006) (requiring objection within 30 days of removal).</p>\n<p>Removal is ordinarily permitted in civil actions where the same case could originally have been brought in federal court \"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). One exceptionsection 22 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)is that \"no case arising under [the Securities Act] and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.\" However, <i>assuming</i> that this limitation applied,<sup>[3]</sup> we conclude that section 22's limitation would not be one of subject matter jurisdiction but merely an advantage that a plaintiff could forfeit by failure to make timely objection.</p>\n<p>There are some casual references in reported circuit-court decisions to section 22 as a limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, <i>e.g., </i><i>Emrich v. Touche Ross &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506120\"><a href=\"/opinion/506120/phillip-emrich-eric-gillberg-v-touche-ross-company-sam-battistone-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1197-98 (9th Cir.1988) (but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*768</span> the objection was made within 30 days, so that conclusion was dictum); <i>Westinghouse Credit Corp. v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601585\"><a href=\"/opinion/601585/westinghouse-credit-corporation-v-ralph-g-thompson-chief-judge-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span>, 683 (10th Cir.1993) (but the remand order was unreviewable whatever the defect); yet a larger number of circuits have held that similarly phrased anti-removal provisions do not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Civil suits asserting claims under the Securities Act are within the \"arising under\" clause of Article III and can easily be brought as original actions in federal court. 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a). Although expressed as a bar on removal of such cases from state court, section 22(a)'s aim is not to preclude hearing such cases in federal court but instead to \"favor[] plaintiffs' choice of forum.\" <i>Pinto v. Maremont Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460314\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460314/pinto-v-maremont-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 167 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y. 1971); <i>see</i> Cook, <i>Recrafting the Jurisdictional Framework for Private Rights of Action Under the Federal Securities Laws,</i> 55 Am. U. L. Rev. 621, 632-34 (2006).</p>\n<p>Given that federal courts are otherwise competent to address federal securities claims and do so all the time, it makes far more sense to view section 22 as creating a waivable right to insist on non-removal. That course achieves the statute's aim to protect the plaintiff's preference for a state forum, but it prevents the mischief of allowing a party to sit on an objection, raising it only if and when the objector is dissatisfied with the result. <i>Cf.</i> 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; J. Steinman, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3739, at 817-18 (4th ed. 2009) (limiting removal objections to thirty-day period prevents use of a defect as insurance against unfavorable developments).</p>\n<p><i>Standing.</i> The more difficult threshold question presented by the appeal is whether plaintiffs can pursue claims, to the extent claims may be stated, based on offerings in which they did not participate and against trusts whose certificates they did not purchase. This issue, styled by defendants primarily as one of Article III standing and secondarily as a standing issue under the Securities Act, was resolved in defendants' favor by the district court. The issue looks straightforward and one would expect it to be well settled; neither assumption is entirely true.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the named plaintiffs have no claim <i>on their own behalf</i> based on trust certificates that they did not buy;<sup>[5]</sup> and they bought no certificates issued by six of the defendant trusts. To the extent claims exist based on such purchases, they belong to the actual purchasers. Since a requisite of an ordinary case or controversy is an injury to the plaintiff traceable to the defendant, <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span> (1992), it might follow that there is also no case or controversy between the named plaintiffs and the trusts from which they made no purchases. Alas, the matter is not so simple.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*769</span> In a properly certified class action, the named plaintiffs regularly litigate not only their own claims but also claims of other class members based on transactions in which the named plaintiffs played no part. Yet, here certain defendants, including six of the eight trusts named as defendants, are not liable to the named plaintiffs on <i>any</i> claims. In these circumstances older cases, including a decision of this court, have refused to allow the case to proceedwhether as a class action or notagainst defendants not implicated in any of the wrongs done to the named plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Barry v.

Each of the insurance companies had almost certainly sold such policies to <i>some</i> members of the class, but none of the <i>named plaintiffs</i> ever bought that type of policy from two of the companies. The district court declined to allow claims against the latter two companies for the sale of those policies and we held there was \"no error in the district court's decision to adhere strictly to the traditional [standing] rules.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13; <i>see also </i><i>Haas v.

Although its discussion of the issue was terse and not the main focus of the decision, its approach had support not only from sister circuit cases but from statements from the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Barry,</i> 555 F.2d at 13.

Arguing that the class action should be a flexible instrument, these courts conclude that the class action should embrace defendants against whom no named plaintiff has a claim so long as the claims are essentially of the same character as the claim against a properly named defendant, and that the sorting out of this issue should be left to Rule 23 criteria rather than by use of standing concepts focusing on named plaintiffs.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>There is no reason to inventory stray Supreme Court quotations that can be found on both sides; nor is there a single recent holding by the Court that with perfect clarity resolves the issue directly before us. Indeed, Rule 23 criteria can still be used as a required tool for shaping the scope of a class action without abandoning the notion that Article III creates some outer limit based on the incentives of the named plaintiffs to adequately litigate issues of importance to them. <i>See </i><i>Baker v.

The qualification, on which we reserve judgment, is one where the claims of the named plaintiffs necessarily give them not just their lawyersessentially the same incentive to litigate the counterpart claims of the class members because the establishment of the named plaintiffs' claims necessarily establishes those of other class members. The matter is one of identity of issues not in the abstract but at a ground floor level. In such a case, which might include the kind of claims that were present in <i>Payton,</i> 308 F.3d at 680, and <i>Fallick,</i> 162 F.3d at 423, the substance of the Article III concern may vanish even if in form it might seem to persist.</p>\n<p>Turning back to our own situationclaims based on mortgage-backed securitiesmost district courts have continued to hold that named plaintiffs must themselves possess claims against each defendant. <i>E.g., </i><i>In re Salomon Smith Barney Mut.

Each trust is backed by loans from a different mix of banks; no named plaintiff has a significant interest in establishing wrongdoing by the particular group of banks that financed a trust from which the named plaintiffs made no purchases. Thus, the claims related to the six trusts from which the named plaintiffs never purchased securities were properly dismissed, as were the six trusts and defendants connected to only those six trusts.</p>\n<p>Although Nomura Asset is a common defendant with respect to all eight of the trusts, claims against it as well fail so far as they are based on the six trusts whose certificates were purchased by no named plaintiff. Although Nomura Asset is a properly named defendant, the named plaintiffs have no stake in establishing liability as to misconduct involving the sales of those certificates. In the Supreme Court's words: \"Nor does a plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind possess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another kind, although similar, to which he has not been subject.\" <i>Blum,</i> 457 U.S. at 999, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On this appeal, plaintiffs claim that three sets of allegations were adequately alleged: one relates to the lending guidelines, another to appraisal standards and a third to credit ratings. The district court disagreed in each case, and we consider the adequacy of the allegations charge by charge.</p>\n<p><i>The underwriting guidelines.</i> Plaintiffs first point to a set of statements in the offering documents implying that the banks that originated the mortgages used lending guidelines to determine borrowers' creditworthiness and ability to repay the loans. For example, the prospectus supplements for the two trusts at issue stated that First National Bank of Nevada (\"FNBN\"), one of the \"key\" loan originators for those trusts, used \"underwriting guidelines [that] are primarily intended to evaluate the prospective borrower's credit standing and ability to repay the loan, as well as the value and adequacy of the proposed mortgaged property as collateral.\"<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In fact, plaintiffs allege, FNBN \"routinely violated\" its lending guidelines and instead approved as many loans as possible, even \"scrub[bing]\" loan applications of potentially disqualifying material. Indeed, plaintiffs allege that this was FNBN's \"business model,\" aimed at milling applications at high speed to generate profits from the sale of such risky loans to others. Thus, plaintiffs say, contrary to the registration statement, borrowers did not \"demonstrate[] an established ability to repay <span class=\"star-pagination\">*773</span> indebtedness in a timely fashion\" and employment history was not \"verified.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Admittedly, warnings in the offering documents state, for example, that the \"underwriting standards . . . typically differ from, and are . . . generally less stringent than, the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\"; that \"certain exceptions to the underwriting standards . . . are made in the event that compensating factors are demonstrated by a prospective borrower\"; and that FNBN \"originates or purchases loans that have been originated under certain limited documentation programs\" that \"may not require income, employment or asset verification.\"</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that, read together with such warnings, the complained-of assurances were not materially false or misleading, but we cannot agree. Neither being \"less stringent\" than Fannie Mae nor saying that exceptions occur when borrowers demonstrate other \"compensating factors\" reveals what plaintiffs allege, namely, a wholesale abandonment of underwriting standards.<sup>[11]</sup> That is true too of the warning that less verification may be employed for \"certain limited documentation programs designed to streamline the loan underwriting process.\" Plaintiffs' allegation of wholesale abandonment may not be proved, butif accepted at this stageit is enough to defeat dismissal.</p>\n<p>Defendants say that no detailed factual support is provided for the allegation and that it is implausible. Despite the familiar generalization that evidence need not be pled at the complaint stage, <i>see </i><i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>, courts increasingly insist that more specific facts be alleged where an allegation is conclusory, <i>see </i><i>Maldonado,</i> 568 F.3d at 266, 274; and the same is true for implausibility, at least where the claim is considered as a whole, <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 570, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>. However, the practices alleged in this case are fairly specific and a number of lenders in the industry are widely understood to have engaged in such practices. The harder problem is whether enough has been said in the complaintbeyond conclusory assertionsto link such practices with specific lending banks that supplied the mortgages that underpinned the trusts. Similar complaints in other cases have cited to more substantial sources, including statements from confidential witnesses, former employees and internal e-mails.</p>\n<p>This is a familiar problem: plaintiffs want discovery to develop such evidence, while courts are loath to license fishing expeditions. While this case presents a judgment call, the sharp drop in the credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> ratings after the sales and the <i>specific</i> allegations as to FNBN offer enough basis to warrant some initial discovery aimed at these precise allegations. The district court is free to limit discovery stringently and to revisit the adequacy of the allegations thereafter and even before possible motions for summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Miss. Pub. Emps.' Ret. Sys. v. Bos. Sci. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203247\"><a href=\"/opinion/203247/mississippi-pub-employeesret-v-boston-scient/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p><i>Appraisal practices.</i> The complaint also alleges that the offering documents contained false statements relating to the methods used to appraise the property values of potential borrowersthe ratio of property value to loan being a key indicator of risk. For example, the April 19, 2006, registration statement and the prospectus supplements stated that \"[a]ll appraisals\" were conducted in accordance with the \"Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice\" (\"USPAP\"). These in turn require that appraisers \"perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence\" and make it unethical for appraisers, among other things, to accept an assignment contingent on reporting a predetermined result.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges in a single general statement that the appraisals underlying the loans at issue here failed to comply with USPAP requirements; but there is no allegation that any specific bank that supplied mortgages to the trusts did exert undue pressure, let alone that the pressure succeeded. The complaint fairly read is that many appraisers in the banking industry were subject to such pressure.<sup>[12]</sup> So, unlike the lending standard allegation, the complaint is essentially a claim that other banks engaged in such practices, some of which probably distorted loans, and therefore this may have happened in this case.</p>\n<p>On this basis, virtually <i>every</i> investor in mortgage-backed securities could subject a multiplicity of defendants \"to the most unrestrained of fishing expeditions.\" <i>Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also </i><i>DM Research, Inc. v.

Accordingly, we agree with the district court that such an allegation amounting to the statement that others in the industry engaged in wrongful pressureis not enough. Several other district courts have reached precisely this conclusion.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Investment ratings.</i> The prospectus supplements set forth ratings that Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Services, Inc. (\"S &amp; P\") or Moody's Investor Services, Inc. (\"Moody's\") had assigned to the certificates or stated that the certificates would not be offered unless they received an \"investment grade\" rating from S &amp; P (AAA through BBB) or Moody's (Aaa through Baa3). There is no claim that the ratings given were misreported or that the \"unless\" condition was not met. Rather, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> plaintiffs say that these ratings were <i>misleading,</i> primarily because they were based on \"outdated models, lowered ratings criteria, and inaccurate loan information.\"</p>\n<p>The ratings are <i>opinions</i> purportedly expressing the agencies' professional judgment about the value and prospects of the certificates. <i>See </i><i>In re Credit Suisse First Bos.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></span> (1990). Liability may on this theory also extend to one who accurately described the opinion.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The complaint includes acknowledgments from S &amp; P and Moody's executives conceding, in hindsight, that the models and data that the rating agencies were using were deficient. But the ratings were not false or misleading because rating agencies should have been using better methods and data. Defendants are not liable under the securities laws when their opinions, or those they reported, were honestly held when formed but simply turn out later to be inaccurate; nor are they liable only because they could have formed \"better\" opinions. <i>See Boilermakers,</i> ___ F.Supp.2d at ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3815796</span></span>, at *7. A majority of district courts that have considered the issue have dismissed similar claims, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed one such dismissal.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to claiming that the ratings were faulty, the complaint also alleges that the ratings agencies produced high ratings aimed at keeping business, and it quotes individuals at the rating companies to support that proposition and to suggest that some inside the company thought that ratings were skewed.<sup>[16]</sup> But, tellingly, the complaint stops short of alleging expressly that the leadership of S &amp; P or Moody's believed that their companies' ratings were false or were unsupported by models that generally captured the quality of the securities being rated.</p>\n<p>The line is admittedly a fine one, but the ratingsinherently opinions and not warranties against error, <i>J &amp; R Mktg.,</i> 549 F.3d at 392-93were accurately reported by defendants and nothing more is required so long as the ratings were honestly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> made, had some basis, and did not omit critical information. That a high rating may be mistaken, a rater negligent in the model employed or the rating company interested in securing more business may be true, but it does not make the report of the rating false or misleading. If the purchaser wants absolute protection against errors of opinion, the answer is insurance rather than lawsuits.</p>\n<p>As sections 11 and 12 are structured, there is liability without fault even for those who merely report the statements or opinions of others; under section 11 this liability for the issuer is absolute; for other defendants (including the issuer under section 12), a defense is available for reporting statements of others if due diligence was exercised. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k(a)-(b), 77<i>l</i>(a)(2).<sup>[17]</sup> Either way, the absence of a scienter element may suggest special caution before classifying an accurate report of a third-party opinion as \"misleading\" based on implied representations about subjective intent or qualifications known only to the third party.</p>\n<p><i>Seller or solicitor allegations.</i> Section 12(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to sue only a defendant who either sold its own security to the plaintiff or (for financial gain) successfully solicited the sale of that security to the plaintiff. <i>Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 642-47, 650 &amp; n. 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112098\"><a href=\"/opinion/112098/pinter-v-dahl/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>. The district court dismissed plaintiffs' section 12(a)(2) claims, concluding that they did not adequately allege that defendants sold the certificates to the plaintiffs or solicited the sales. This was apparently because the complaint used a more ambiguous phrasethat plaintiffs \"acquired the [c]ertificates pursuant and/or traceable to\" the offering documentsfound insufficient by a number of courts. <i>E.g., </i><i>Pub. Emps.' Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540779\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540779/public-employeesret-sys-v-merrill-lynch-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); <i>Wells Fargo,</i> 712 F.Supp.2d at 966.</p>\n<p>But the complaint also alleged that plaintiffs \"acquired . . . [c]ertificates <i>from</i> defendant Nomura Securities\" and that the \"[d]efendants <i>promoted and sold</i> the [c]ertificates <i>to</i> [the p]laintiffs and other members of the [c]lass\" (emphasis added); these allegations are sufficient to state a claim under section 12(a)(2) so long as material misstatements or misleading omissions are alleged. The district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' section 12(a)(2) claims for failure to allege defendants' requisite connections with the sale was in error.</p>\n<p><i>Control person liability.</i> Finally, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' section 15 \"control person\" liability claims because it held that plaintiffs failed to state a violation of the securities laws to begin with. Section 15 creates liability for any individual or entity that \"controls any person liable\" under sections 11 or 12. 15 U.S.C. § 77<i>o; see </i><i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1201 n. 2. Because we hold that plaintiffs adequately stated some claims under sections 11 and 12(a)(2), we also hold that the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' section 15 claim was in error. Given the \"highly factual nature\" of the control person inquiry, resolving that issue on a motion to dismiss is often inappropriate. 2 Hazen, <i>supra,</i> § 7.12[2], at 343 n. 38.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of all claims based upon purchases of the AR1, AR2, AF2, AR3, AR4 and WF1 trusts and all defendants including those six trusts implicated only as to their certificates. As to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> claims against the AF1 and AP1 trusts and other remaining defendants, we <i>affirm</i> the dismissal of all claims save those relating to the statements regarding the lending banks' underwriting practices but <i>vacate</i> the dismissal of the latter claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
