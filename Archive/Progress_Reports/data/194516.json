Claimant, Ana M. Gimenez, appeals from\n                    \n\na  district  court judgment  affirming  the  decision of  the\n\nSecretary of  Health  and  Human Services  that  she  is  not\n\nentitled to Social Security disability benefits.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Claimant   applied   for  disability   benefits  on\n\nNovember 7, 1989.  She claimed an onset  date of December 31,\n\n1988;  her insured status expired  on December 31,  1992.  At\n\nthe  time she filed her application, she was fifty years old.\n\nClaimant's alleged impairments included herniated discs, left\n\nhand injury, migraine headaches, osteoporosis, pinched nerves\n\nand cardiac arrythmia.   Her claim  was denied initially  and\n\nupon reconsideration.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held\n\na hearing and determined that claimant could perform her past\n\nwork.   The Appeals  Council  denied claimant's  request  for\n\nreview.  Thus,  the ALJ's decision became the  final decision\n\nof the Secretary.\n\n          From  her   testimony  at   the  hearing   and  the\n\ndisability  report  completed  by  claimant,   the  following\n\nevidence  emerges.  Claimant worked for  the same company for\n\nnineteen years until it  closed in December 1988.   While she\n\nwas there she held  several positions.  She began  working as\n\nan accounting clerk.  In this  position, she took care of the\n\naccounts receivable books and did filing.   Her next position\n\nas  a   productions   clerk  involved   keeping   handwritten\n\nproduction reports and assisting with taking inventory.   She\n\nthen became  an inventory control clerk and  worked solely on\n\nkeeping  track  of  inventory.    These  positions  generally\n\nrequired  her  to  be  seated  fifty  percent  of  the  time.\n\nClaimant's last position was as a receptionist.  At this job,\n\nshe  sat all of the  time.  She stated that  she used both of\n\nher  hands  for tasks  such  as  operating a  calculator  and\n\nworking the switchboard.\n\n          Claimant  sustained  a  back  injury  in  1980  and\n\nasserted that due to  back and hip pain, she could not remain\n\nin  one position too  long; she often had  missed work due to\n\nthis pain.  After  her job ended in December  1988, she tried\n\nworking as  a drug  store clerk.   This  job lasted  one week\n\nbecause claimant could not stand.  Claimant also alleged pain\n\nin her left  big toe, left  leg and right  knee.  She  stated\n\nthat due to left foot spurs the foot would swell so much that\n\nshe could  not stand.   Claimant receives injections  for the\n\npain in her knees.  She  also takes other medication for  the\n\npain but  is limited in  the amount  she can use  due to  her\n\ncardiac problems.   This  medication gives her  \"some relief\"\n\nfrom the pain.\n\n          As for  her headaches, claimant testified  that, at\n\nthe  time  of  the  hearing,  she  had  been  suffering  from\n\nmigraines on a daily basis for the past six years.   During a\n\nmigraine attack, she is unable  to concentrate, read or think\n\nand  cannot  tolerate  light.    The  medication  she  takes,\n\nhowever, alleviates the symptoms.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Claimant stated that she also suffered from pain in\n\nher left shoulder, arm,  hand and fingers.  She  averred that\n\nthe nerves in her fingers are  pinched and that, as a result,\n\nshe  cannot perform any tasks with her left hand (claimant is\n\nleft-handed).  Specifically, her  left hand becomes  swollen,\n\ncramped and numb; she  cannot uncurl her fingers to  open her\n\nhand all  the way.   She testified  that her  right hand  was\n\nbeginning to develop similar symptoms.\n\n            Claimant shares a duplex  with relatives.  She is\n\nable  to take  care of  her personal needs.   Her  mother and\n\nsister help with the cooking.  She sweeps and mops about once\n\nor  twice a  month, washes  dishes, irons  and takes  out the\n\ntrash.  Her mother does all the laundry because of claimant's\n\nproblems  with her hands.   Claimant goes to  church when she\n\ncan,  drives an  automobile and  does her  household shopping\n\nwith  help  from relatives.    However, she  cannot  do heavy\n\nhousehold cleaning chores and yard work.   She reads, watches\n\ntelevision and  receives visitors two to three times a month.\n\nShe  spends a  lot of  time in  a prone  position due  to her\n\nheadaches.\n\n          The ALJ  determined that  claimant suffered  from a\n\ncombination  of  impairments  including   degenerative  joint\n\ndisease,  essential  hypertension,  left trapezius  myositis,\n\nmild right and left carpal tunnel syndrome and a painful left\n\nfoot  hallux valgus (angulation of great toe).  He noted that\n\n                             -4-\n\none  physician had  reported that  claimant suffered  from an\n\nanxiety  disorder  but  that  claimant  never   had  received\n\ntreatment for it.  Thus, he determined, this mental condition\n\ndid  not reduce, in any significant way, her capacity for the\n\nperformance of basic work activities.  He credited claimant's\n\nsubjective complaints  of disabling  pain only to  the extent\n\nthat her residual functional capacity was limited to the full\n\nrange  of light exertion.   He  then concluded  that claimant\n\ncould perform her past work.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          A claimant for Social Security  disability benefits\n\nbears  the initial  burden  of establishing  that  he or  she\n\ncannot perform  past relevant work.   Goodermote v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health and Human Services, 690  F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1982).\n                            \n\nThis  burden includes  proving that  a claimant  is prevented\n\nfrom  returning to  his or  her type  of work  generally, not\n                                                        \n\nsolely to the  particular job.   See Dudley  v. Secretary  of\n                                                             \n\nHealth  and Human Services, 816 F.2d 792, 795 (1st Cir. 1987)\n                          \n\n(per  curiam); Gray v. Heckler,  760 F.2d 369,  372 (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1985)  (per curiam).  Our standard of review under the Social\n\nSecurity  Act is  whether  the  Secretary's determination  is\n\nsupported  by \"substantial  evidence.\"   42 U.S.C.    405(g).\n\nAlthough the record may support  more than one conclusion, we\n\nwill uphold  the Secretary  if \"a reasonable  mind, reviewing\n\nthe evidence  in the record  as a  whole, could accept  it as\n\n                             -5-\n\nadequate to support his  conclusion.\"  Rodriguez v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health and  Human Services,  647 F.2d 218,  222 (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1981).   The resolution of  conflicts in the  evidence is for\n\nthe Secretary, not the courts.  Id.\n                                   \n\n          On  appeal  claimant  presents   essentially  three\n\narguments:   (1) the severity  of her carpal  tunnel syndrome\n\nprevented her from  performing the full  range of both  light\n\nand  sedentary work; (2) due to her back and foot conditions,\n\nshe could not sit or stand for sufficient  periods of time to\n\nengage in any work;  and (3) the ALJ did  not properly credit\n\nher allegations of  pain.   Before turning to  the merits  of\n\nthese  claims, we  note  that this  is  an especially  sparse\n\nrecord.   Claimant's  evidence consists  of three  very brief\n\nprogress notes  from the  State Insurance Fund,  four cursory\n\nresponses   to   Social  Security   disability  determination\n\nquestionnaires prepared by claimant's treating physicians and\n\ntwo radiology reports.   In addition, the Secretary submitted\n\nthe   record  to  two  non-examining  doctors  who  completed\n\nresidual  functional capacity  (RFC) forms  and  had claimant\n\nexamined by  a consultative rheumatologist.   We will discuss\n\nthis evidence in light of claimant's issues on appeal.\n\n          1.    Claimant   argues,  that,   based  upon   her\n\ntestimony, the  carpal tunnel syndrome  is so severe  that it\n\namounts to a serious nonexertional impairment.  She refers to\n\nSocial Security Ruling (SSR) 83-14, entitled Capability to do\n\n                             -6-\n\nOther Work -- the Medical-Vocational Rules as a Framework for\n\nEvaluating  a  Combination  of  Exertional  and Nonexertional\n\nImpairments.   Although  not directly  on point,  this ruling\n\nstates that  sedentary work requires good use  of the fingers\n\nand  hands.   Given  this, claimant  concludes,  the ALJ  was\n\nrequired to  secure the testimony  of a vocational  expert to\n\nassess the extent  to which her carpal tunnel syndrome eroded\n\nthe occupational base for light and sedentary work.1  Id.\n                                                         \n\n          We  do not  believe  that  the  ALJ  erred  in  not\n\nsecuring  such testimony.    In claimant's  medical evidence,\n\nthere is only  one reference to any impairment  involving her\n\nhands.  In an arthritis  medical questionnaire, Dr. Victor M.\n\nGonzalez states  that claimant has swelling of  the joints of\n\nher left  hand and that the fourth finger of her left hand is\n\na  \"trigger  finger.\"   He  provided  no further  explanation\n\ndespite the  specific request for \"a  detailed description of\n\n                    \n\n1.  Claimant also relies on SSR 85-15, which concerns the use\nof the Medical-Vocational Guidelines for solely nonexertional\nlimitations, for the  argument that for  unskilled, sedentary\n                                                  \nwork,  claimant  must  be able  to  use  her  hands for  fine\nmanipulations  such as  picking, pinching,  grasping, holding\nand  turning.  We only note that the ALJ described claimant's\npast work as semi-skilled  in nature, a finding she  does not\n                         \ndispute.    In  any event,  the  two  RFC  forms stated  that\nclaimant had no limits in performing fine manipulations.\n    Similarly, Sec. 201.00(h)  of Pt. 404,  Subpt. P, App.  2\n(the  Medical-Vocational  Guidelines)  which states  that  an\ninjury resulting  in the inability to  perform jobs requiring\nbilateral  manual  dexterity  would  support  a   finding  of\ndisabled  is  inapposite.    Subsection  (h)  is  an  example\nconcerning an  individual  under  45  years  of  age  who  is\nrestricted to unskilled sedentary work.\n                       \n\n                             -7-\n\nthe affected major joints in terms of . . .  loss of strength\n\nof hand function (grasp, grip, pinch).\"  Nor did Dr. Gonzalez\n\ncomplete  the  range  of  motion  chart  or  the  periods  of\n\nexacerbation table  as requested.  Finally,  Dr. Gonzalez did\n\nnot   list   carpal   tunnel  syndrome   under   the  heading\n   \n\n\"diagnosis\".\n\n          Indeed,   the   only  physician   to   so  diagnose\n\nclaimant's problems with her hands was Dr.  Luis Olivari, the\n\ndoctor  to  whom  the   Secretary  referred  claimant  for  a\n\nconsultative examination.  He noted that  claimant had a weak\n\nleft  hand grip  and related  the  weakness to  carpal tunnel\n\nsyndrome.  However,  he noted that her  hand condition \"might\n\nimprove with adequate treatment.\"\n\n          The Social Security regulations require claimant to\n\nsubmit  medical  reports which  include \"[a]  statement about\n\nwhat you can still do despite your impairment(s). . . . \"  20\n\nC.F.R.     404.1513(b)(6).   This statement must  refer to  a\n\nclaimant's ability to  handle objects. Id.    404.1513(c)(1).\n                                          \n\nFurther, the  medical evidence  should be complete  enough to\n\nenable  the Secretary  to  determine  a claimant's  \"residual\n\nfunctional  capacity to  do work-related  . .  . activities.\"\n\nId. 404.1513(d)(3).   None of the  medical evidence submitted\n   \n\nby claimant contains this information.\n\n          In the  absence of any  such evidence, the  ALJ was\n\nentitled to rely on  the RFC forms which both  indicated that\n\n                             -8-\n\nclaimant  had  no limitation  in using  her fingers  for fine\n\nmanipulation.   The  only limit  noted in  both forms  was in\n\nusing  the  hands  for  gross manipulations.    Further,  the\n\nexamining  physician found  normal wrist motion  and, besides\n\nthe   left  hand   weakness,  did   not  mention   any  other\n\nmanipulative difficulties  that would indicate  that claimant\n\ndid  not retain  the  \"good use  of  the hands  and  fingers\"\n\nrequired for most sedentary  work.  See SSR 83-14.   Although\n                                       \n\nwe  have pointed out  in the past,  and now  point out again,\n\nthat  the  Secretary  should  have  the  examining consultant\n\ncomplete an RFC evaluation, see Rivera-Torres v. Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth and Human Services, 837 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1988) (per\n                         \n\ncuriam), we find  that there was  sufficient evidence in  the\n\nrecord to support the ALJ's conclusion.2  \n\n          2.  Claimant argues  that two C.T. scans --  one in\n\nJuly  1990 and one in October 1990 -- establish her inability\n\nto work due to her  back and foot conditions.  The  July 1990\n\nC.T. scan showed a narrowing of the disc spaces at L4-L5  and\n\nL5-S1; the disc at  L5-S1 was bulging.  In addition, the scan\n\nshowed mild osteoarthritis changes of the L5-S1 and right L4-\n\nL5  facet joints.  The  October 1990 C.T.  scan report stated\n\nthat claimant suffered from severe degenerative joint disease\n\n                    \n\n2.  We  also note in this  context that there  is no evidence\nthat claimant ever sought treatment for the problems with her\nhands,  another basis for upholding the  ALJ's decision.  See\n                                                             \nTsarelka  v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 842 F.2d\n                                                   \n529, 534 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam).\n\n                             -9-\n\nin  her  left great  toe  with spur  formation  and sclerotic\n\nchanges.     Claimant  points   out  that   the  nonexamining\n\nphysicians  who   completed  the  RFC   assessments  and  the\n\nconsultant  who examined  claimant in  December 1989  did not\n\nhave the benefit  of these  \"objective\" medical data.   As  a\n\nresult,  she  argues,  a  medical  advisor  was  required  to\n\ninterpret  them  because the  ALJ,  a  lay  person,  may  not\n\ntranslate  such data into  functional terms.   See Berrios v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary  of Health  and Human  Services, 796 F.2d  574, 576\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam).\n\n          We  reject  this  argument.    First,  one  of  the\n\nnonexamining physicians completed his  RFC assessment on  May\n\n21, 1990.  At this time, the medical questionnaire, completed\n\nby  Dr.  Irizarry on  May  8,  1990, was  in  the  file.   In\n\nanswering this  questionnaire, Dr. Irizarry refers  to a C.T.\n\nscan  of March  9, 19903  which showed  essentially  the same\n\ncondition  as the July  scan -- degenerative  disc disease at\n\nL4-L5-S1, osteoarthritis of the  posterior facet joints and a\n\nnarrowing of the spinal canal at L5-S1.  Also on file at this\n\ntime was  an earlier questionnaire completed  by Dr. Irizarry\n\nin November 1989.  Although mostly illegible, it appears that\n\nclaimant's   diagnoses   at    this   time   were    cervical\n\nosteoarthritis and cervical fibromyositis.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Claimant  failed to include a  copy of the  report of the\nMarch 1990 C.T. scan in the record.\n\n                             -10-\n\n          Second, both nonexamining physicians had the report\n\nof  Dr. Olivari,  the Secretary's  consultant.   Although, as\n\nclaimant points out, Dr. Olivari's examination occurred seven\n\nmonths prior to the July 1990 C.T. scan, it nonetheless could\n\nserve as a  basis for the RFC assessments.  First, it appears\n\nfrom  the  State Insurance  Fund  (SIF)  progress notes  that\n\nclaimant's present back condition is related to an injury she\n\nsustained  in 1980.  Second, claimant alleged that she had to\n                  \n\nstop work in 1988 due to her back condition.  As there  is no\n\nindication that claimant's symptoms worsened between 1988 and\n\nJuly 1990  when the  C.T. scan was  performed, Dr.  Olivari's\n\nobservations  in 1989  are  pertinent.   This examination  of\n\nclaimant revealed  full range of motion  of claimant's spine.\n\nThere was mild difficulty in kneeling and some left trapezius\n\nspasm.   However, there were no motor or sensory deficits and\n\nno  inflammation of the major  joints; all deep reflexes were\n\nnormal.   Dr.  Olivari  diagnosed degenerative  joint disease\n\n(which the  C.T. scan confirmed) and painful left foot hallux\n\nvalgus.\n\n          This is  more than sufficient evidence  on which to\n\nbase an RFC assessment.4   Turning to these assessments, both\n\n                    \n\n4.  Claimant argues that the  physician who completed the RFC\nassessment dated  May 21,  1990, did  not  give a  reasonable\nexplanation as to how  he reached his conclusions.   A review\nof  the  RFC form  belies  this contention.    Concerning her\nexertional  limitations,  the  physician  indicates  that  he\nrelied on the following evidence:  (1) complaints of cervical\nand lumbar pain;  (2) morning stiffness;  (3) the March  C.T.\n\n                             -11-\n\nphysicians determined that claimant could frequently lift and\n\ncarry weights up to twenty-five pounds and occasionally could\n\nlift and carry objects weighing up to fifty pounds.  Claimant\n\ncould sit, stand and walk up to six hours per  activity.  She\n\ncould occasionally stoop, kneel,  crouch, balance and  crawl.\n\nHer ability to push and pull was  unlimited up to the weights\n\nfor lifting and carrying.\n\n          In  this context,  we note  that Dr.  Irizarry also\n\nneglected to  complete the  range of  motion  charts and  the\n\nperiods of exacerbation tables.  This information is directly\n\nrelated to residual functional  capacity and it is claimant's\n\nburden at step  four of the sequential  evaluation process to\n\nproduce  such evidence.  See  Goodermote, 690 F.2d  at 7; see\n                                                             \n\nalso  20 C.F.R.    404.1513.   Although  there is  a conflict\n    \n\nbetween the  RFC assessments  and claimant's testimony  as to\n\nher limits,  such  conflicts  are for  the  Secretary.    See\n                                                             \n\nRodriguez,  647 F.2d at 222.   We therefore  cannot fault the\n         \n\ndetermination that  claimant could perform the  full range of\n\nlight and sedentary work.\n\n          3.   \"[C]omplaints  of pain  need not  be precisely\n\ncorroborated  by   objective  findings,  but  they   must  be\n\nconsistent with  medical findings.\"   Dupuis v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth  and Human Services, 869 F.2d 622, 623 (1st Cir. 1989)\n                          \n\n                    \n\nscan which  revealed degenerative disc  disease at  L4-L5-S1;\n(4) vertebral muscle spasm; and (5) vertigo.\n\n                             -12-\n\n(per  curiam).    In  reviewing such  complaints,  the  ALJ's\n\ncredibility  determination  is  entitled  to  deference where\n\nthere are specific  findings to support it.   See Frustaglia,\n                                                            \n\n829  F.2d  at 195.    Here, the  RFC  assessments of  the two\n\nnonexamining   physicians  who   reviewed  the   record  both\n\nindicated that claimant's conditions did not prevent her from\n\nengaging  in sedentary  or light  work.   This  conclusion is\n\nsupported by  Dr. Olivari's  report indicating full  range of\n\nmotion of claimant's head, shoulders, wrists, hips and spine.\n\n          Although the results of  the C.T. scans reflect the\n\nkind  of conditions  that can  be  expected to  produce pain,\n\nclaimant's  own  description  of  her  daily  activities,  in\n\naddition to the  medical findings referred  to above, do  not\n\nsupport  the  conclusion  that  her pain  was  as  severe  as\n\nalleged.  Claimant stated that she cleans her home regularly,\n\nattends to her  personal needs and drives  a car.   She takes\n\nmedication that alleviates her  symptoms; one of her treating\n\nphysicians noted  mild improvement  and a 1988  progress note\n\nfrom the  S.I.F. indicates  that claimant had  no complaints.\n\nBased  on the foregoing, we agree with the ALJ's decision not\n\nto credit claimant's allegations of totally disabling pain.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -13-\n",

Claimant, Ana M. Gimenez, appeals from\n                    \n\na  district  court judgment  affirming  the  decision of  the\n\nSecretary of  Health  and  Human Services  that  she  is  not\n\nentitled to Social Security disability benefits.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Claimant   applied   for  disability   benefits  on\n\nNovember 7, 1989.  She claimed an onset  date of December 31,\n\n1988;  her insured status expired  on December 31,  1992.  At\n\nthe  time she filed her application, she was fifty years old.\n\nClaimant's alleged impairments included herniated discs, left\n\nhand injury, migraine headaches, osteoporosis, pinched nerves\n\nand cardiac arrythmia.   Her claim  was denied initially  and\n\nupon reconsideration.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held\n\na hearing and determined that claimant could perform her past\n\nwork.   The Appeals  Council  denied claimant's  request  for\n\nreview.  Thus,  the ALJ's decision became the  final decision\n\nof the Secretary.\n\n          From  her   testimony  at   the  hearing   and  the\n\ndisability  report  completed  by  claimant,   the  following\n\nevidence  emerges.  Claimant worked for  the same company for\n\nnineteen years until it  closed in December 1988.   While she\n\nwas there she held  several positions.  She began  working as\n\nan accounting clerk.  In this  position, she took care of the\n\naccounts receivable books and did filing.   Her next position\n\nas  a   productions   clerk  involved   keeping   handwritten\n\nproduction reports and assisting with taking inventory.   She\n\nthen became  an inventory control clerk and  worked solely on\n\nkeeping  track  of  inventory.    These  positions  generally\n\nrequired  her  to  be  seated  fifty  percent  of  the  time.\n\nClaimant's last position was as a receptionist.  At this job,\n\nshe  sat all of the  time.  She stated that  she used both of\n\nher  hands  for tasks  such  as  operating a  calculator  and\n\nworking the switchboard.\n\n          Claimant  sustained  a  back  injury  in  1980  and\n\nasserted that due to  back and hip pain, she could not remain\n\nin  one position too  long; she often had  missed work due to\n\nthis pain.  After  her job ended in December  1988, she tried\n\nworking as  a drug  store clerk.   This  job lasted  one week\n\nbecause claimant could not stand.  Claimant also alleged pain\n\nin her left  big toe, left  leg and right  knee.  She  stated\n\nthat due to left foot spurs the foot would swell so much that\n\nshe could  not stand.   Claimant receives injections  for the\n\npain in her knees.  She  also takes other medication for  the\n\npain but  is limited in  the amount  she can use  due to  her\n\ncardiac problems.   This  medication gives her  \"some relief\"\n\nfrom the pain.\n\n          As for  her headaches, claimant testified  that, at\n\nthe  time  of  the  hearing,  she  had  been  suffering  from\n\nmigraines on a daily basis for the past six years.   During a\n\nmigraine attack, she is unable  to concentrate, read or think\n\nand  cannot  tolerate  light.    The  medication  she  takes,\n\nhowever, alleviates the symptoms.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Claimant stated that she also suffered from pain in\n\nher left shoulder, arm,  hand and fingers.  She  averred that\n\nthe nerves in her fingers are  pinched and that, as a result,\n\nshe  cannot perform any tasks with her left hand (claimant is\n\nleft-handed).  Specifically, her  left hand becomes  swollen,\n\ncramped and numb; she  cannot uncurl her fingers to  open her\n\nhand all  the way.   She testified  that her  right hand  was\n\nbeginning to develop similar symptoms.\n\n            Claimant shares a duplex  with relatives.  She is\n\nable  to take  care of  her personal needs.   Her  mother and\n\nsister help with the cooking.  She sweeps and mops about once\n\nor  twice a  month, washes  dishes, irons  and takes  out the\n\ntrash.  Her mother does all the laundry because of claimant's\n\nproblems  with her hands.   Claimant goes to  church when she\n\ncan,  drives an  automobile and  does her  household shopping\n\nwith  help  from relatives.    However, she  cannot  do heavy\n\nhousehold cleaning chores and yard work.   She reads, watches\n\ntelevision and  receives visitors two to three times a month.\n\nShe  spends a  lot of  time in  a prone  position due  to her\n\nheadaches.\n\n          The ALJ  determined that  claimant suffered  from a\n\ncombination  of  impairments  including   degenerative  joint\n\ndisease,  essential  hypertension,  left trapezius  myositis,\n\nmild right and left carpal tunnel syndrome and a painful left\n\nfoot  hallux valgus (angulation of great toe).  He noted that\n\n                             -4-\n\none  physician had  reported that  claimant suffered  from an\n\nanxiety  disorder  but  that  claimant  never   had  received\n\ntreatment for it.  Thus, he determined, this mental condition\n\ndid  not reduce, in any significant way, her capacity for the\n\nperformance of basic work activities.  He credited claimant's\n\nsubjective complaints  of disabling  pain only to  the extent\n\nthat her residual functional capacity was limited to the full\n\nrange  of light exertion.   He  then concluded  that claimant\n\ncould perform her past work.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          A claimant for Social Security  disability benefits\n\nbears  the initial  burden  of establishing  that  he or  she\n\ncannot perform  past relevant work.

The resolution of  conflicts in the  evidence is for\n\nthe Secretary, not the courts.  Id.\n                                   \n\n          On  appeal  claimant  presents   essentially  three\n\narguments:   (1) the severity  of her carpal  tunnel syndrome\n\nprevented her from  performing the full  range of both  light\n\nand  sedentary work; (2) due to her back and foot conditions,\n\nshe could not sit or stand for sufficient  periods of time to\n\nengage in any work;  and (3) the ALJ did  not properly credit\n\nher allegations of  pain.   Before turning to  the merits  of\n\nthese  claims, we  note  that this  is  an especially  sparse\n\nrecord.   Claimant's  evidence consists  of three  very brief\n\nprogress notes  from the  State Insurance Fund,  four cursory\n\nresponses   to   Social  Security   disability  determination\n\nquestionnaires prepared by claimant's treating physicians and\n\ntwo radiology reports.   In addition, the Secretary submitted\n\nthe   record  to  two  non-examining  doctors  who  completed\n\nresidual  functional capacity  (RFC) forms  and  had claimant\n\nexamined by  a consultative rheumatologist.   We will discuss\n\nthis evidence in light of claimant's issues on appeal.\n\n          1.    Claimant   argues,  that,   based  upon   her\n\ntestimony, the  carpal tunnel syndrome  is so severe  that it\n\namounts to a serious nonexertional impairment.  She refers to\n\nSocial Security Ruling (SSR) 83-14, entitled Capability to do\n\n                             -6-\n\nOther Work -- the Medical-Vocational Rules as a Framework for\n\nEvaluating  a  Combination  of  Exertional  and Nonexertional\n\nImpairments.   Although  not directly  on point,  this ruling\n\nstates that  sedentary work requires good use  of the fingers\n\nand  hands.   Given  this, claimant  concludes,  the ALJ  was\n\nrequired to  secure the testimony  of a vocational  expert to\n\nassess the extent  to which her carpal tunnel syndrome eroded\n\nthe occupational base for light and sedentary work.1  Id.\n                                                         \n\n          We  do not  believe  that  the  ALJ  erred  in  not\n\nsecuring  such testimony.    In claimant's  medical evidence,\n\nthere is only  one reference to any impairment  involving her\n\nhands.  In an arthritis  medical questionnaire, Dr. Victor M.\n\nGonzalez states  that claimant has swelling of  the joints of\n\nher left  hand and that the fourth finger of her left hand is\n\na  \"trigger  finger.\"   He  provided  no further  explanation\n\ndespite the  specific request for \"a  detailed description of\n\n                    \n\n1.  Claimant also relies on SSR 85-15, which concerns the use\nof the Medical-Vocational Guidelines for solely nonexertional\nlimitations, for the  argument that for  unskilled, sedentary\n                                                  \nwork,  claimant  must  be able  to  use  her  hands for  fine\nmanipulations  such as  picking, pinching,  grasping, holding\nand  turning.  We only note that the ALJ described claimant's\npast work as semi-skilled  in nature, a finding she  does not\n                         \ndispute.    In  any event,  the  two  RFC  forms stated  that\nclaimant had no limits in performing fine manipulations.\n    Similarly, Sec. 201.00(h)  of Pt. 404,  Subpt. P, App.  2\n(the  Medical-Vocational  Guidelines)  which states  that  an\ninjury resulting  in the inability to  perform jobs requiring\nbilateral  manual  dexterity  would  support  a   finding  of\ndisabled  is  inapposite.    Subsection  (h)  is  an  example\nconcerning an  individual  under  45  years  of  age  who  is\nrestricted to unskilled sedentary work.\n                       \n\n                             -7-\n\nthe affected major joints in terms of . . .  loss of strength\n\nof hand function (grasp, grip, pinch).\"  Nor did Dr. Gonzalez\n\ncomplete  the  range  of  motion  chart  or  the  periods  of\n\nexacerbation table  as requested.  Finally,  Dr. Gonzalez did\n\nnot   list   carpal   tunnel  syndrome   under   the  heading\n   \n\n\"diagnosis\".\n\n          Indeed,   the   only  physician   to   so  diagnose\n\nclaimant's problems with her hands was Dr.  Luis Olivari, the\n\ndoctor  to  whom  the   Secretary  referred  claimant  for  a\n\nconsultative examination.  He noted that  claimant had a weak\n\nleft  hand grip  and related  the  weakness to  carpal tunnel\n\nsyndrome.  However,  he noted that her  hand condition \"might\n\nimprove with adequate treatment.\"\n\n          The Social Security regulations require claimant to\n\nsubmit  medical  reports which  include \"[a]  statement about\n\nwhat you can still do despite your impairment(s). . . . \"  20\n\nC.F.R.     404.1513(b)(6).   This statement must  refer to  a\n\nclaimant's ability to  handle objects. Id.    404.1513(c)(1).\n                                          \n\nFurther, the  medical evidence  should be complete  enough to\n\nenable  the Secretary  to  determine  a claimant's  \"residual\n\nfunctional  capacity to  do work-related  . .  . activities.\"\n\nId. 404.1513(d)(3).   None of the  medical evidence submitted\n   \n\nby claimant contains this information.\n\n          In the  absence of any  such evidence, the  ALJ was\n\nentitled to rely on  the RFC forms which both  indicated that\n\n                             -8-\n\nclaimant  had  no limitation  in using  her fingers  for fine\n\nmanipulation.   The  only limit  noted in  both forms  was in\n\nusing  the  hands  for  gross manipulations.    Further,  the\n\nexamining  physician found  normal wrist motion  and, besides\n\nthe   left  hand   weakness,  did   not  mention   any  other\n\nmanipulative difficulties  that would indicate  that claimant\n\ndid  not retain  the  \"good use  of  the hands  and  fingers\"\n\nrequired for most sedentary  work.

Claimant argues  that two C.T. scans --  one in\n\nJuly  1990 and one in October 1990 -- establish her inability\n\nto work due to her  back and foot conditions.  The  July 1990\n\nC.T. scan showed a narrowing of the disc spaces at L4-L5  and\n\nL5-S1; the disc at  L5-S1 was bulging.  In addition, the scan\n\nshowed mild osteoarthritis changes of the L5-S1 and right L4-\n\nL5  facet joints.  The  October 1990 C.T.  scan report stated\n\nthat claimant suffered from severe degenerative joint disease\n\n                    \n\n2.  We  also note in this  context that there  is no evidence\nthat claimant ever sought treatment for the problems with her\nhands,  another basis for upholding the  ALJ's decision.

Claimant  points   out  that   the  nonexamining\n\nphysicians  who   completed  the  RFC   assessments  and  the\n\nconsultant  who examined  claimant in  December 1989  did not\n\nhave the benefit  of these  \"objective\" medical data.   As  a\n\nresult,  she  argues,  a  medical  advisor  was  required  to\n\ninterpret  them  because the  ALJ,  a  lay  person,  may  not\n\ntranslate  such data into  functional terms.   See Berrios v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary  of Health  and Human  Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474007\"><a href=\"/opinion/474007/14-socsecrepser-250-unemplinsrep-cch-16884-sofia-berrios-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam).\n\n          We  reject  this  argument.    First,  one  of  the\n\nnonexamining physicians completed his  RFC assessment on  May\n\n21, 1990.  At this time, the medical questionnaire, completed\n\nby  Dr.  Irizarry on  May  8,  1990, was  in  the  file.   In\n\nanswering this  questionnaire, Dr. Irizarry refers  to a C.T.\n\nscan  of March  9, 19903  which showed  essentially  the same\n\ncondition  as the July  scan -- degenerative  disc disease at\n\nL4-L5-S1, osteoarthritis of the  posterior facet joints and a\n\nnarrowing of the spinal canal at L5-S1.  Also on file at this\n\ntime was  an earlier questionnaire completed  by Dr. Irizarry\n\nin November 1989.  Although mostly illegible, it appears that\n\nclaimant's   diagnoses   at    this   time   were    cervical\n\nosteoarthritis and cervical fibromyositis.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Claimant  failed to include a  copy of the  report of the\nMarch 1990 C.T. scan in the record.\n\n                             -10-\n\n          Second, both nonexamining physicians had the report\n\nof  Dr. Olivari,  the Secretary's  consultant.   Although, as\n\nclaimant points out, Dr. Olivari's examination occurred seven\n\nmonths prior to the July 1990 C.T. scan, it nonetheless could\n\nserve as a  basis for the RFC assessments.  First, it appears\n\nfrom  the  State Insurance  Fund  (SIF)  progress notes  that\n\nclaimant's present back condition is related to an injury she\n\nsustained  in 1980.  Second, claimant alleged that she had to\n                  \n\nstop work in 1988 due to her back condition.  As there  is no\n\nindication that claimant's symptoms worsened between 1988 and\n\nJuly 1990  when the  C.T. scan was  performed, Dr.  Olivari's\n\nobservations  in 1989  are  pertinent.   This examination  of\n\nclaimant revealed  full range of motion  of claimant's spine.\n\nThere was mild difficulty in kneeling and some left trapezius\n\nspasm.   However, there were no motor or sensory deficits and\n\nno  inflammation of the major  joints; all deep reflexes were\n\nnormal.   Dr.  Olivari  diagnosed degenerative  joint disease\n\n(which the  C.T. scan confirmed) and painful left foot hallux\n\nvalgus.\n\n          This is  more than sufficient evidence  on which to\n\nbase an RFC assessment.4   Turning to these assessments, both\n\n                    \n\n4.  Claimant argues that the  physician who completed the RFC\nassessment dated  May 21,  1990, did  not  give a  reasonable\nexplanation as to how  he reached his conclusions.   A review\nof  the  RFC form  belies  this contention.    Concerning her\nexertional  limitations,  the  physician  indicates  that  he\nrelied on the following evidence:  (1) complaints of cervical\nand lumbar pain;  (2) morning stiffness;  (3) the March  C.T.\n\n                             -11-\n\nphysicians determined that claimant could frequently lift and\n\ncarry weights up to twenty-five pounds and occasionally could\n\nlift and carry objects weighing up to fifty pounds.  Claimant\n\ncould sit, stand and walk up to six hours per  activity.  She\n\ncould occasionally stoop, kneel,  crouch, balance and  crawl.\n\nHer ability to push and pull was  unlimited up to the weights\n\nfor lifting and carrying.\n\n          In  this context,  we note  that Dr.  Irizarry also\n\nneglected to  complete the  range of  motion  charts and  the\n\nperiods of exacerbation tables.  This information is directly\n\nrelated to residual functional  capacity and it is claimant's\n\nburden at step  four of the sequential  evaluation process to\n\nproduce  such evidence.  See  Goodermote, 690 F.2d  at 7; see\n                                                             \n\nalso  20 C.F.R.    404.1513.   Although  there is  a conflict\n    \n\nbetween the  RFC assessments  and claimant's testimony  as to\n\nher limits,  such  conflicts  are for  the  Secretary.    See\n                                                             \n\nRodriguez,  647 F.2d at 222.   We therefore  cannot fault the\n         \n\ndetermination that  claimant could perform the  full range of\n\nlight and sedentary work.\n\n          3.   \"[C]omplaints  of pain  need not  be precisely\n\ncorroborated  by   objective  findings,  but  they   must  be\n\nconsistent with  medical findings.\"   Dupuis v.

In  reviewing such  complaints,  the  ALJ's\n\ncredibility  determination  is  entitled  to  deference where\n\nthere are specific  findings to support it.   See Frustaglia,\n                                                            \n\n829  F.2d  at 195.    Here, the  RFC  assessments of  the two\n\nnonexamining   physicians  who   reviewed  the   record  both\n\nindicated that claimant's conditions did not prevent her from\n\nengaging  in sedentary  or light  work.   This  conclusion is\n\nsupported by  Dr. Olivari's  report indicating full  range of\n\nmotion of claimant's head, shoulders, wrists, hips and spine.\n\n          Although the results of  the C.T. scans reflect the\n\nkind  of conditions  that can  be  expected to  produce pain,\n\nclaimant's  own  description  of  her  daily  activities,  in\n\naddition to the  medical findings referred  to above, do  not\n\nsupport  the  conclusion  that  her pain  was  as  severe  as\n\nalleged.  Claimant stated that she cleans her home regularly,\n\nattends to her  personal needs and drives  a car.   She takes\n\nmedication that alleviates her  symptoms; one of her treating\n\nphysicians noted  mild improvement  and a 1988  progress note\n\nfrom the  S.I.F. indicates  that claimant had  no complaints.\n\nBased  on the foregoing, we agree with the ALJ's decision not\n\nto credit claimant's allegations of totally disabling pain.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -13-\n</pre>",
