R.\n\nCrim. P.  11(a)(2).  In  denying the motion to  suppress, the\n\ndistrict court stated that it  believed the testimony of  the\n\ngovernment witness, Anderson,  and that it took  into account\n\nthe nature of the area and the history of volatile conduct in\n\nthat particular station and concluded that the temporary stop\n\nand pat search was reasonable under all of the circumstances.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n          Anderson  testified that  he and  another uniformed\n\nofficer  of the  Massachusetts  Bay Transportation  Authority\n\n(MBTA) were manning a directed patrol of the Roxbury Crossing\n\nMBTA Station.  According to him, \"Directed patrol is the time\n\nof  a day  that is  targeted for  high visibility  because of\n\nparticular instances that  have happened in a  certain area.\"\n\nThe officers placed  themselves inside the turnstiles  on the\n\nupper level, near  the head of the stairs  and escalator from\n\nwhich  they could  look  down  and see  almost  all that  was\n\nbelow  -- a  single platform  flanked  by an  inboard and  an\n\noutboard  line.  Anderson testified that several hundred high\n\nschool students come through  there a day, and at the time in\n\n                    \n\n1.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\n                 \n\n                             -2-\n\nquestion a couple of hundred were boarding an outbound train.\n\n\"We  observed  two   young  males  acting  in   a  disorderly\n\nmanner. . . .   [T]hey were banging on the  train windows and\n\ngiving the  other students  the middle  finger and  they were\n\nbecoming quite loud . . . pounding against the  windows . . .\n\nThere  were obscenities.\"  Defendant wore a hooded sweatshirt\n\njust over  the belt and a goosedown type of coat hanging past\n\nhis knees  that could conceal a  weapon.  We had  \"decided to\n\ntalk  to  the two  gentlemen  to  let  them know  that  their\n\nbehavior was extremely  disorderly and we didn't  expect that\n\nfrom them.\"   \"We intended to  talk with  them and tell  them\n\nthat that type  of behavior was not appropriate;  don't do it\n\nagain; leave the station.\"\n\n          When  defendant and friend  reached the top  of the\n\nescalator Anderson told  defendant -- whom they  had assigned\n\nto  him -- to step aside; that  he wanted to speak to him, to\n\ncheck  him,  at  which  point  defendant   looked  \"extremely\n\nnervous.\"  When  Anderson patted his outside  clothing around\n\nthe waist,  immediately feeling  a gun,  defendant sought  to\n\nflee, but Anderson restrained him.\n\n          In complaining that Anderson's  conduct invaded his\n\nFourth Amendment rights  to be free of  unreasonable searches\n\nand  seizures defendant stresses  the following points.   His\n\n                             -3-\n\nprior  conduct had  been, at  most, a  misdemeanor.2   He had\n\nleft the site, and  had discontinued the conduct.  He bore no\n\noutward appearance of being armed.  The officer did not make,\n\nor propose  to make, an  arrest.  The pat-down  occurred even\n\nbefore the officer asked any questions.\n\n          Most  of these  matters are  easily  answered.   If\n\nthere was  a shown need for a safety pat-down, the sooner the\n\nbetter.   Equally, we see no  relevance in the length  of the\n\nstate  sentence  defendant  had exposed  himself  to.   While\n\ndefendant's clothing was  in current style, and so  could not\n\naffirmatively  be held against  him, Ybarra v.  Illinois, 444\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 85,  93 (1979),  its  capacity for  concealment was  not\n\nirrelevant.      Defendant's   other  points   require   more\n\nconsideration.\n\n          This case,  of course,  involves two  events:   the\n\nstop,  and  the  search  (a pat-down  of  even  the slightest\n\ncharacter being  a search).   Terry at 16.   The two  must be\n                                   \n\nconstrued together.\n\n               [I]n determining whether the seizure\n          and   search   were   \"unreasonable\"  our\n          inquiry  is  a  dual one  --  whether the\n          officer's  action  was justified  at  its\n          inception, and whether  it was reasonably\n          related  in  scope to  the  circumstances\n          which justified  the interference  in the\n          first place.\n\nTerry at 20.\n     \n\n                    \n\n2.  This  it clearly  was.   Mass.  G.L. c.  272   53  (1990)\n(\". . . disorderly persons, disturbers of the peace . . .\").\n\n                             -4-\n\n          This test should be applied in both directions.  An\n\nofficer might wish to stop a pedestrian from crossing against\n\nthe light.  Should he not refrain  from doing so, for lack of\n\nrelative importance,  if the pedestrian's  general appearance\n\nmade  him  fear that  his  safety  might  be involved  if  he\n\naccosted him?  Here the need of accosting justified the stop;\n\neven if a search would be in order.  It was highly desirable,\n\nif  not  the duty,  of  the  patrol  officers to  make  their\n\npresence felt and warn against future misbehavior even though\n\ndoing so, in  the officers' opinion, would call  for a safety\n\nsearch.    Our  sole  question is  the  correctness  of  that\n\nopinion:     \"[W]hether  a  reasonably  prudent  man  in  the\n\ncircumstances  would  be  warranted in  the  belief  that his\n\nsafety or that of others was in danger.\"  Terry at 27.\n                                               \n\n          The district court spoke, correctly, of the history\n\nof the area, confirmed by the very fact that the MBTA felt it\n\nadvisable to provide a  special patrol.  The court  doubtless\n\nnoted the provocative nature of defendant's  conduct.  With a\n\ncouple of hundred  students present there might well  be many\n\nwho  would be  offended.   Was  he \"emboldened\"  by having  a\n\nweapon?  Cf. United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 25 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 2813 (1991) (concealed weapon\n                   \n\nmay embolden).\n\n          For the words  \"reasonably\" and \"circumstances\"  an\n\nimportant consideration is the calendar  -- the times.   With\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe plethora of  gun carrying, particularly by the  young, we\n\nmust  have  sympathy,  to an  extent,  with  police officers'\n\napprehensions.  And, as there may be degrees of apprehension,\n\nso  may there be degrees  of invasion upon  privacy.  We will\n\nnot overrule the district court in this case, but do note the\n\nquestion extremely close.   Also, we  remind police that  the\n\ncharacter  of the  neighborhood  does  not provide  automatic\n\npermission, Brown  v. Texas, 443  U.S. 47 (1979);  every case\n                           \n\nmust  be  considered  on its  own  reasons  for suspicion  of\n\ndanger.   United  States v.  Stanley, 915  F.2d 54  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1990).\n\n          A  word as to  defendant's contention that,  on the\n\nbasis of  Anderson's testimony,  he had  two objectives.   In\n\naddition  to lecturing defendant to keep  away and not repeat\n\nhis offense, for which he felt the need of protecting himself\n\nand others,  Anderson intended  to pat  defendant down  based\n\nsimply on  his conduct  in disturbing the  peace.   The fact,\n\nhowever, that he had this additional purpose did not, even if\n\nimproper,  destroy the  validity of  the  one that  the court\n\nrelied on.   We need not,  accordingly, evaluate it.   At the\n\nsame time, we cannot resist  remarking that it comes with ill\n\ngrace  from someone engaged in affronting his fellow citizens\n\nwholesale, as was  this one, to claim that  a pat-down of his\n\nouter clothing was  a \"serious intrusion upon the sanctity of\n\n[his] person, which may inflict  great indignity.\"  Terry  at\n                                                         \n\n                             -6-\n\n17.  Cf. Curley v. Curtis Pub. Co., 48 F.  Supp. 27 (D. Mass.\n                                  \n\n1942) (plaintiff claiming emotional suffering from defamation\n\ncan be shown accustomed to abuse others).\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n",

Sec. 922(g)(1), but subject to the right to appeal the propriety of the Terry type stop and search that had discovered the gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2).  In denying the motion to suppress, the district court stated that it believed the testimony of the government witness, Anderson, and that it took into account the nature of the area and the history of volatile conduct in that particular station and concluded that the temporary stop and pat search was reasonable under all of the circumstances.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson testified that he and another uniformed officer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) were manning a directed patrol of the Roxbury Crossing MBTA Station.  According to him, \"Directed patrol is the time of a day that is targeted for high visibility because of particular instances that have happened in a certain area.\"   The officers placed themselves inside the turnstiles on the upper level, near the head of the stairs and escalator from which they could look down and see almost all that was below--a single platform flanked by an inboard and an outboard line.  Anderson testified that several hundred high school students come through there a day, and at the time in question a couple of hundred were boarding an outbound train.  \"We observed two young males acting in a disorderly manner....  [T]hey were banging on the train windows and giving the other students the middle finger and they were becoming quite loud ... pounding against the windows ...  There were obscenities.\"   Defendant wore a hooded sweatshirt just over the belt and a goosedown type of coat hanging past his knees that could conceal a weapon.  We had \"decided to talk to the two gentlemen to let them know that their behavior was extremely disorderly and we didn't expect that from them.\"  \"We intended to talk with them and tell them that that type of behavior was not appropriate;  don't do it again;  leave the station.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When defendant and friend reached the top of the escalator Anderson told defendant--whom they had assigned to him--to step aside;  that he wanted to speak to him, to check him, at which point defendant looked \"extremely nervous.\"   When Anderson patted his outside clothing around the waist, immediately feeling a gun, defendant sought to flee, but Anderson restrained him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In complaining that Anderson's conduct invaded his Fourth Amendment rights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures defendant stresses the following points.  His prior conduct had been, at most, a misdemeanor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He had left the site, and had discontinued the conduct.  He bore no outward appearance of being armed.  The officer did not make, or propose to make, an arrest.  The pat-down occurred even before the officer asked any questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of these matters are easily answered.  If there was a shown need for a safety pat-down, the sooner the better.  Equally, we see no relevance in the length of the state sentence defendant had exposed himself to.  While defendant's clothing was in current style, and so could not affirmatively be held against him, Ybarra v. Illinois, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 93, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></span> (1979), its capacity for concealment was not irrelevant.  Defendant's other points require more consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, of course, involves two events:  the stop, and the search (a pat-down of even the slightest character being a search).  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877.   The two must be construed together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n determining whether the seizure and search were \"unreasonable\" our inquiry is a dual one--whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Terry at 20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This test should be applied in both directions.  An officer might wish to stop a pedestrian from crossing against the light.  Should he not refrain from doing so, for lack of relative importance, if the pedestrian's general appearance made him fear that his safety might be involved if he accosted him?   Here the need of accosting justified the stop;  even if a search would be in order.  It was highly desirable, if not the duty, of the patrol officers to make their presence felt and warn against future misbehavior even though doing so, in the officers' opinion, would call for a safety search.  Our sole question is the correctness of that opinion:  \"[W]hether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\"  Terry at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court spoke, correctly, of the history of the area, confirmed by the very fact that the MBTA felt it advisable to provide a special patrol.  The court doubtless noted the provocative nature of defendant's conduct.  With a couple of hundred students present there might well be many who would be offended.  Was he \"emboldened\" by having a weapon?   Cf. United States v. Wilkinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556387\"><a href=\"/opinion/556387/united-states-v-robert-j-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

With the plethora of gun carrying, particularly by the young, we must have sympathy, to an extent, with police officers' apprehensions.  And, as there may be degrees of apprehension, so may there be degrees of invasion upon privacy.  We will not overrule the district court in this case, but do note the question extremely close.  Also, we remind police that the character of the neighborhood does not provide automatic permission, Brown v. Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110128\"><a href=\"/opinion/110128/brown-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110128\"><a href=\"/opinion/110128/brown-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (1979);  every case must be considered on its own reasons for suspicion of danger.  United States v. Stanley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548685\"><a href=\"/opinion/548685/united-states-v-dennis-g-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A word as to defendant's contention that, on the basis of Anderson's testimony, he had two objectives.  In addition to lecturing defendant to keep away and not repeat his offense, for which he felt the need of protecting himself and others, Anderson intended to pat defendant down based simply on his conduct in disturbing the peace.  The fact, however, that he had this additional purpose did not, even if improper, destroy the validity of the one that the court relied on.  We need not, accordingly, evaluate it.  At the same time, we cannot resist remarking that it comes with ill grace from someone engaged in affronting his fellow citizens wholesale, as was this one, to claim that a pat-down of his outer clothing was a \"serious intrusion upon the sanctity of [his] person, which may inflict great indignity.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 17, 88 S.Ct. at 1877.
