(collectively, the\n\nPetitioners) seek review  of an order of  the National Labor\n\nRelations Board (the Board) which required them to cease and\n\ndesist  from unfair labor practices and from infringing upon\n\ntheir employees' Section  7 rights under the  National Labor\n\nRelations Act as amended (the Act), 29 U.S.C.   151 et seq.,\n\nto  make  employee  Eileen Bourque  whole  for  any loss  of\n\nearnings  suffered  by  her,  and  to  post  an  appropriate\n\nnotice.1   The Board  cross-applies for  enforcement of  its\n\norder against  the Petitioners.   We  deny the  Petitioners'\n\npetition  for  review,  and  we  grant  the  Board's  cross-\n\napplication for enforcement against the Petitioners.\n\n                             I.\n\n       Holyoke,    a   private,   non-profit   organization,\n\nprovides nursing  services, home health aide, homemaker, and\n\nhospice  care  to  people in  their  own  homes.   Holyoke's\n\nemployees  are   represented  for  purposes   of  collective\n\nbargaining by  Service Employees International  Union, Local\n\n                    \n\n1The Board had  jurisdiction over this matter  under section\n10(a)  of  the  Act,  29   U.S.C.     160(a),  and  we  have\njurisdiction  over this  appeal  pursuant  to  29  U.S.C.   \n160(e).\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n285 (the \"Union\").  Holyoke's activities are directed by its\n\nDirector of Hospice, Patricia Cavanaugh.\n\n       O'Connell, Inc. is  a referral  agency that  supplies\n\nnurses  and licensed practical nurses to hospitals and other\n\ninstitutions  on a  per  diem  or hourly  rate  basis.   The\n\nactivities  of O'Connell, Inc. are directed by its president\n\nand  sole stockholder, Francis  O'Connell.   O'Connell, Inc.\n\nhires  the nurses  and  licensed practical  nurses,  carries\n\ninsurance on them, sets their  wage rates, and pays them for\n\ntheir  work,   making  appropriate  deductions   for  taxes.\n\nO'Connell, Inc.'s employees  are not represented by  a union\n\nand do not participate in any collective bargaining.\n\n       The  Petitioners have a  written contract under which\n\nO'Connell,  Inc.  makes  its  nurse  employees available  to\n\nHolyoke as needed and Holyoke reimburses O'Connell, Inc. for\n\ntheir services at a specified  hourly rate.  Typically,  the\n\nnurses  supplied arrive at  Holyoke's office in  the morning\n\nwhere Holyoke supervisors give them a  list of patients that\n\nthey  are to attend,  a report on  the patients' conditions,\n\nand directions to the patients' homes.  Holyoke supplies the\n\npersons  referred with  a visiting  nurse  bag containing  a\n\nstethoscope and  blood pressure  cup.   The nurses  take the\n\nsame  breaks as Holyoke  employees and frequently  eat lunch\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nwith them.  If a problem arises during the day, the referred\n\nemployees  contact their  Holyoke supervisor.   After making\n\ntheir rounds and before leaving  for the day, they report to\n\none of the  Holyoke supervisors to discuss  the patients and\n\nfile written reports  which become the property  of Holyoke.\n\nHolyoke supervisors make decisions  concerning the continued\n\nuse of referred  nurses based on need and  the feedback that\n\nthey receive from  patients and staff.  If  a referred nurse\n\ndoes not meet Holyoke's standards, Holyoke has the authority\n\nto reject that person in the future.\n\n       In late  1990 and early 1991,  Holyoke and the  Union\n\nrenegotiated their collective bargaining  agreement.  One of\n\nthe issues  was the  security maintained  by Holyoke  in its\n\nparking  lot.   The  area surrounding  the  parking lot  had\n\nbecome  dangerous   because  of  nearby   drug  dealing  and\n\nprostitution,  and  two Holyoke  nurses  had been  assaulted\n\nthere.   In January, 1991, Holyoke employees voted to engage\n\nin  a practice  called \"work  to rule\"  in order  to support\n\ntheir contract demands.   That is, as a  show of solidarity,\n\nthey decided to arrive  as a group at 8:00 A.M.,  take their\n\nbreaks together, and leave as a group at 4:30 P.M.  \n\n       On  a   number  of  occasions   in  1990   and  1991,\n\nO'Connell,  Inc. referred Eileen Bourque, a registered nurse\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nemployed by it,  to Holyoke.  Initially,  Bourque frequently\n\narrived for  work 15 or  20 minutes prior  to her 8:00  A.M.\n\nstarting  time and waited  outside until a  Holyoke employee\n\narrived to  open the  building.  After  the assaults  in the\n\nfall  of 1990,  however,  Bourque stayed  in  her car  until\n\nanother person arrived.  In January, 1991, Bourque overheard\n\nHolyoke  employees talking about  their intention  to arrive\n\nfor  work as  a group at  8:00 A.M.   Because of  her safety\n\nfears,  Bourque  ceased  coming to  work  early  and instead\n\narrived for work at 8:00 a.m. to enter the building with the\n\nHolyoke nurses.  One day, Holyoke Director Cavanaugh watched\n\nthe staff  enter the building  and saw Bourque walk  in with\n\nthe group.  Suspecting that  Bourque was joining forces with\n\nthe Holyoke  nurses  in their  union  activities,  Cavanaugh\n\ntelephoned O'Connell and complained about Bourque. \n\n       Shortly  thereafter,  Bourque  became  sick  and  was\n\nunable to  work from January 17  to February 5, 1991.   Upon\n\nher return, she  was told to  meet with O'Connell.   At  the\n\nmeeting,  O'Connell  informed  Bourque  that  she  had  been\n\nobserved walking into the Holyoke office with the nurses who\n\nwere in a  \"work to rule\"  protest, that Cavanaugh  believed\n\nthat such action was a demonstration of Bourque's allegiance\n\nfor the Union, and that Cavanaugh had requested that she not\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nbe  reassigned to Holyoke.   Bourque explained  to O'Connell\n\nthat she  entered the building  with the Holyoke  nurses for\n\nsafety and security reasons, and that she had not taken part\n\nin  any union  activity.   O'Connell replied  that he  would\n\nrelate  Bourque's  explanation  to  Cavanaugh,  but  advised\n\nBourque  that  Holyoke was  his  bread  and  butter  and  if\n\nCavanaugh wanted to stand by  her decision, she did not have\n\nto give  him any reason  for rejecting a  referred employee.\n\nO'Connell further cautioned  Bourque that she  should remain\n\nneutral and uninvolved  with the Holyoke employees.   A week\n\nlater, O'Connell informed Bourque that Cavanaugh  understood\n\nthe safety issue,  and that everything  was back to  normal.\n\nBourque was again referred to Holyoke on February 19, 1991.\n\n       Subsequently, Bourque  filed a charge  with the Board\n\nand the  Board's General Counsel  issued a complaint.   At a\n\nhearing   before  an  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ),  he\n\nrendered a decision  and recommended order holding  that the\n\nPetitioners were joint  employers under  the Act.   The  ALJ\n\nalso held that the Petitioners violated sections 8(a)(1) and\n\n(3)  of the  Act by  threatening and  denying employment  to\n\nBourque  because of  their  mistaken  belief  that  she  had\n\nassisted Holyoke's  employees in their  protected and  union\n\nactivities.   The Board  adopted the recommendations  of the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nALJ and ordered the Petitioners to cease and desist from the\n\nunfair  labor practices found and from infringing upon their\n\nemployees'  Section 7 rights.2  The Board also  required the\n\nPetitioners to make  Bourque whole for any  loss of earnings\n\nsuffered by her and to post an appropriate notice.\n\n                            II.\n\n       The  Petitioners  essentially  raise  two  issues  on\n\nappeal.  First, they contend that the Board erred in holding\n\nthat they are joint  employers of the employees  referred by\n\nO'Connell, Inc. to  Holyoke.  Second, the  Petitioners argue\n\nthat the Board  erred in ruling that  they violated sections\n\n8(a)(1)  and (3)  of  the  Act  by threatening  and  denying\n\nemployment to Bourque.\n\n                    A.  Joint Employers\n\n       A  joint employer  relationship  exists where  two or\n\nmore employers  exert  significant  control  over  the  same\n\nemployees and  share or co-determine those matters governing\n\nessential  terms and  conditions of  employment.

Thus,  the Board's  finding of  joint\n\nemployer  status is entitled to  acceptance by this court if\n\nit is supported  by substantial evidence on the  record as a\n\nwhole.  See NLRB v. Horizon  Air Servs., Inc., 761 F.2d  22,\n                                             \n\n25 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n       This court has not  set forth a specific test to  use\n\nin  evaluating  whether  a joint  relationship  exists.

NLRB, 418  F.2d 127,  129 (5th\n                                  \n\nCir. 1969) (joint employers found from evidence that company\n\nhad right to approve employees, control number of employees,\n\nremove an employee,  inspect and approve  work, and pass  on\n\nchanges in pay and overtime allowed). \n\n       The   Board's   finding   that   Holyoke    possessed\n\nsufficient  control over the O'Connell, Inc. employees to be\n\ndeemed  a  joint  employer   is  supported  by   substantial\n\nevidence.  First, Holyoke had  the right to refuse to accept\n\nany  employee that it  did not want.   The record shows that\n\nHolyoke monitored the performance of  the referred employees\n\nand if an employee did not meet its standards, Holyoke could\n\nand  did require that O'Connell, Inc. refrain from referring\n\nthe employee again.  The record further shows that O'Connell\n\ncompletely deferred  to Holyoke's  demands concerning  which\n\nreferrals would be  accepted by Holyoke.   In fact,  Holyoke\n\nexercised  its power  in this  case to  refuse Bourque  as a\n\nreferral.  Second,  the record reveals that  Holyoke assumed\n\nsupervision  over  the  referred  employees.   The  referred\n\nemployees reported to Holyoke's office where they were given\n\ncertain supplies, the day's work assignment, a report on the\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npatients' conditions, and directions to the patients' homes.\n\nIf  referred employees encountered a problem during the day,\n\nthey were  instructed to  contact a  Holyoke supervisor  for\n\nadvice.   At  the end  of  the day,  the referred  employees\n\nreturned to the Holyoke office  and made a written report to\n\nHolyoke  of  their activities.    Moreover,  the Petitioners\n\nacknowledge that in the eyes of their patients, the referred\n\nnurses were regarded as Holyoke employees.\n\n       The   Petitioners  argue   that   with   professional\n\npersonnel, by definition, there may be direction as to where\n\nto go, but no control or  supervision as to \"how\" to do  the\n\nassignment   involved.  They   liken   this   case  to   the\n\nprofessional  drivers  discussed  by  the  Board  in  Laerco\n                                                            \n\nTransportation  &amp; Warehouse, 269  NLRB 324 (1984),  in which\n                           \n\nthe  Board found that Laerco's supervision over the referred\n\nemployees was too routine to  make Laerco a joint  employer.\n\nAs discussed  above, however,  the supervision exercised  by\n\nHolyoke over  the O'Connell,  Inc. referrals  was more  than\n\nroutine.   That  the  referred  employees were  professional\n\nnurses who may not have  required much instruction as to how\n\nto  perform  their  work  does  not  negate  the  power   of\n\nsupervision and  direction that Holyoke  exercised over them\n\nonce they reported for work.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n       More important than the factual distinctions  between\n\ncases are  the specific facts  of this particular case.   In\n\nCarrier Corp.  v. NLRB, 768  F.2d 778, 781 (6th  Cir. 1985),\n                      \n\nthe  Sixth Circuit  Court of  Appeals  rejected an  argument\n\nidentical to  the one made here by Holyoke.  The court found\n\nthat  the same cases cited  by Holyoke3 were not dispositive\n\nfor two reasons.  \n\n       First, because  the joint  employer issue  is\n       simply  a  factual  determination,  a  slight\n       difference  between  two cases  might  tilt a\n       case toward a finding of  a joint employment.\n       . . .  Second, the only question  before this\n       Court  is  whether  in  this particular  case\n       there is substantial evidence to support  the\n       Board's finding  that [the petitioner]  was a\n       joint  employer.  As we have discussed in the\n       text,  we believe there was ample evidence to\n       support such a finding.   Whether there could\n       have been substantial  evidence to support  a\n       finding  of joint  employment  in the  above-\n       cited Board decisions is  not an issue before\n       the Court.\n\nId. at 781-82 n.1.

Cir. 1985);  H&amp;W  Motor Express,  Inc.,  271 NLRB  466\n                                            \n(1984); Laerco, 269 NLRB 324. \n              \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\njoint  control of the referred employees by, inter alia, its\n                                                       \n\nunfettered  power to  reject any  person referred  to it  by\n\nO'Connell, Inc., and  its substantial control over  the day-\n\nto-day activities of  the referred employees.   Thus, we see\n\nno error  in the Board's  finding that  the Petitioners  are\n\njoint employers of the employees referred by O'Connell, Inc.\n\nto work for Holyoke.\n\n                  B.  Violation of the Act\n\n       The Petitioners next contend that  the Board erred in\n\nfinding that they  violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3)  of the\n\nAct  by  threatening  and  denying  employment  to  Bourque.\n\nEmployers  violate sections  8(a)(1) and (3)  of the  Act by\n\nthreatening  reprisals or  discriminating against  employees\n\nbecause they engage  in union or other  activities protected\n\nby the Act or are suspected of doing so.  See NLRB v Horizon\n                                                            \n\nAir Servs., Inc. 761 F.2d at 26 n.2; NLRB v. American Spring\n                                                            \n\nBed Mfg. Co., 670 F.2d 1236, 1241-42 (1st Cir. 1982).  Thus,\n            \n\nproof of an unfair labor  practice does not require proof of\n\nactual  union activity; it is sufficient if the employer was\n\nmotivated  by  suspected union  activity in  discharging the\n\nemployee.  See e.g., McLane/Western, Inc. v. NLRB, 827  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1423, 1425 (10th Cir. 1987).  \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n       In  this  case,  the  Holyoke  employees adopted  the\n\ntactic  of arriving  for  work  together  to  support  their\n\nposition in ongoing contract  negotiations.  Bourque  joined\n\nthe group  for safety  reasons, not  to support  the Holyoke\n\nemployees.   Cavanaugh  observed  Bourque  with the  Holyoke\n\nemployees  and  telephoned   O'Connell  to  complain   about\n\nBourque's support for the Union.  O'Connell informed Bourque\n\nof Cavanaugh's request  that Bourque not return  to Holyoke.\n\nWhen Bourque explained  that she  had joined  the group  for\n\nsafety  reasons,  O'Connell  replied that  he  would  try to\n\nexplain that to  Cavanaugh, but that Cavanaugh  did not have\n\nto  give any  reason for  her  request that  Bourque not  be\n\nreassigned.    O'Connell  advised  Bourque that  she  should\n\nremain  neutral and uninvolved  with the  Holyoke employees.\n\nO'Connell subsequently resolved  matters with Cavanaugh  and\n\nagain referred Bourque to Holyoke.\n\n       At the hearing, both of  the Petitioners denied  that\n\nCavanaugh had asked  O'Connell to stop referring  Bourque to\n\nHolyoke.   The ALJ, however, found that \"Bourque's testimony\n\nwas candid and  straightforward, and  [his] observations  of\n\nher demeanor convince[d him] that she was telling the  truth\n\nin her  descriptions of her  conversations with  O'Connell.\"\n\nThe Board accepted the ALJ's credibility determinations.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n       The ALJ's credibility determinations are entitled  to\n\ngreat weight since  he saw and heard  the witnesses testify.\n\nRikal, Inc. v. NLRB, 721 F.2d 402,  406 (1st Cir. 1983).  As\n                   \n\nstated by this court in American Spring Bed, supra,\n                                                  \n\n       The credibility  of witnesses is for  the ALJ\n       to  determine, and  the reviewing  court will\n       set  aside   such  findings   only  when   he\n       oversteps the bounds  of reason.  So  long as\n       the  ALJ's   position  represents   a  choice\n       between  two  fairly  conflicting  views,  it\n       should be  enforced even if  this court would\n       justifiably have made  a different choice had\n       the matter come before it de novo.\n                                        \n\n670 F.2d at 1242 (citations omitted). \n\n       The  Petitioners  offer  no  proof  that  the   ALJ's\n\ncredibility  findings are unreasonable.  Thus, we accept the\n\nALJ's findings that Holyoke requested O'Connell, Inc. not to\n\nrefer Bourque  because  of Holyoke's  erroneous belief  that\n\nBourque  was  assisting  the  unionized  employees  in their\n\nprotected  demonstration;  that  O'Connell,  Inc.  willingly\n\ncomplied with  Holyoke's illegal request; and that O'Connell\n\nspecifically cautioned  Bourque not to involve  herself with\n\nthe  demonstrating  Holyoke  employees.     Once  the  ALJ's\n\ncredibility  findings  are  accepted,  there  is  more  than\n\nsufficient evidence to  support the Board's ruling  that the\n\nPetitioners both   violated sections 8(a)(1) and  (3) of the\n\nAct.\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\n       The final  determination set  forth  by  the ALJ  and\n\nupheld by the  Board relative to the  unfair labor practices\n\nis as follows:\n\n       The  facts  noted  above, show  that  Bourque\n       would have worked  at least some of  the days\n       that [Holyoke] used  referrals from O'Connell\n       in  the period between February 5, 1991, when\n       Bourque  was  released  by  her  doctor,  and\n       February  19,  1991  when  she  was  actually\n       assigned to [Holyoke].  The question  of just\n       how many days must  wait until the compliance\n       stage of this proceeding.\n\nThe  Petitioners  submit   that  the  above   conclusion  is\n\nspeculative and they  set forth testimony that,  they argue,\n\nshows that Bourque did not miss any days of work for Holyoke\n\ndue to their actions.  \n\n       To the contrary, the evidence creates an issue as  to\n\nhow many days,  if any, Bourque would have  been referred to\n\nHolyoke during the period that the Petitioners prevented her\n\nreferral.  Bourque  testified that her schedule  for working\n\nat  Holyoke was  arranged as  far as  three months  ahead of\n\ntime, or as short as the morning  of work.  In the past, she\n\nhad been  called the  day before  and even  at  9:00 in  the\n\nmorning of the  day she was to  work.  Therefore, the  Board\n\ndid  not err  in finding  that  Bourque may  be entitled  to\n\nbackpay  and that  the amount  of backpay  owing to  Bourque\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ncould  be   resolved,  if  necessary,   in  the   compliance\n\nproceeding following enforcement of the Board's order.\n\n       This  court has approved  the same  kind of order and\n\nprocedure in  a similar  situation.  In  NLRB v.  Globe Mfg.\n                                                            \n\nCo., 580 F.2d  18, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1978),  where an employer\n   \n\nhad imposed a  discriminatory recall policy on  an employee,\n\nthis  court upheld  a  Board  order  leaving  to  compliance\n\nproceedings the resolution  of whether the employee  in fact\n\nwould  have  been recalled  in  the absence  of  the illegal\n\npolicy.   The  court noted  that  it could  not rule  on the\n\ncompany's claim that the employee was unemployable under the\n\ncompany's standards,  and it refused to prolong  the case by\n\ndeclining enforcement  and remanding the  case.  Id.  at 22.\n                                                   \n\nRather,  the court  held  that the  Board's  order would  be\n\nenforced and the  company would be  entitled to present  its\n\nproofs  and seek  to disprove  both  damages and  a duty  to\n\nreinstate.

Holyoke's activities are directed by its\n\nDirector of Hospice, Patricia Cavanaugh.\n\n       O'Connell, Inc. is  a referral  agency that  supplies\n\nnurses  and licensed practical nurses to hospitals and other\n\ninstitutions  on a  per  diem  or hourly  rate  basis.   The\n\nactivities  of O'Connell, Inc. are directed by its president\n\nand  sole stockholder, Francis  O'Connell.   O'Connell, Inc.\n\nhires  the nurses  and  licensed practical  nurses,  carries\n\ninsurance on them, sets their  wage rates, and pays them for\n\ntheir  work,   making  appropriate  deductions   for  taxes.\n\nO'Connell, Inc.'s employees  are not represented by  a union\n\nand do not participate in any collective bargaining.\n\n       The  Petitioners have a  written contract under which\n\nO'Connell,  Inc.  makes  its  nurse  employees available  to\n\nHolyoke as needed and Holyoke reimburses O'Connell, Inc. for\n\ntheir services at a specified  hourly rate.  Typically,  the\n\nnurses  supplied arrive at  Holyoke's office in  the morning\n\nwhere Holyoke supervisors give them a  list of patients that\n\nthey  are to attend,  a report on  the patients' conditions,\n\nand directions to the patients' homes.  Holyoke supplies the\n\npersons  referred with  a visiting  nurse  bag containing  a\n\nstethoscope and  blood pressure  cup.   The nurses  take the\n\nsame  breaks as Holyoke  employees and frequently  eat lunch\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nwith them.  If a problem arises during the day, the referred\n\nemployees  contact their  Holyoke supervisor.   After making\n\ntheir rounds and before leaving  for the day, they report to\n\none of the  Holyoke supervisors to discuss  the patients and\n\nfile written reports  which become the property  of Holyoke.\n\nHolyoke supervisors make decisions  concerning the continued\n\nuse of referred  nurses based on need and  the feedback that\n\nthey receive from  patients and staff.  If  a referred nurse\n\ndoes not meet Holyoke's standards, Holyoke has the authority\n\nto reject that person in the future.\n\n       In late  1990 and early 1991,  Holyoke and the  Union\n\nrenegotiated their collective bargaining  agreement.  One of\n\nthe issues  was the  security maintained  by Holyoke  in its\n\nparking  lot.   The  area surrounding  the  parking lot  had\n\nbecome  dangerous   because  of  nearby   drug  dealing  and\n\nprostitution,  and  two Holyoke  nurses  had been  assaulted\n\nthere.   In January, 1991, Holyoke employees voted to engage\n\nin  a practice  called \"work  to rule\"  in order  to support\n\ntheir contract demands.   That is, as a  show of solidarity,\n\nthey decided to arrive  as a group at 8:00 A.M.,  take their\n\nbreaks together, and leave as a group at 4:30 P.M.  \n\n       On  a   number  of  occasions   in  1990   and  1991,\n\nO'Connell,  Inc. referred Eileen Bourque, a registered nurse\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nemployed by it,  to Holyoke.  Initially,  Bourque frequently\n\narrived for  work 15 or  20 minutes prior  to her 8:00  A.M.\n\nstarting  time and waited  outside until a  Holyoke employee\n\narrived to  open the  building.  After  the assaults  in the\n\nfall  of 1990,  however,  Bourque stayed  in  her car  until\n\nanother person arrived.  In January, 1991, Bourque overheard\n\nHolyoke  employees talking about  their intention  to arrive\n\nfor  work as  a group at  8:00 A.M.   Because of  her safety\n\nfears,  Bourque  ceased  coming to  work  early  and instead\n\narrived for work at 8:00 a.m. to enter the building with the\n\nHolyoke nurses.  One day, Holyoke Director Cavanaugh watched\n\nthe staff  enter the building  and saw Bourque walk  in with\n\nthe group.  Suspecting that  Bourque was joining forces with\n\nthe Holyoke  nurses  in their  union  activities,  Cavanaugh\n\ntelephoned O'Connell and complained about Bourque. \n\n       Shortly  thereafter,  Bourque  became  sick  and  was\n\nunable to  work from January 17  to February 5, 1991.   Upon\n\nher return, she  was told to  meet with O'Connell.   At  the\n\nmeeting,  O'Connell  informed  Bourque  that  she  had  been\n\nobserved walking into the Holyoke office with the nurses who\n\nwere in a  \"work to rule\"  protest, that Cavanaugh  believed\n\nthat such action was a demonstration of Bourque's allegiance\n\nfor the Union, and that Cavanaugh had requested that she not\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nbe  reassigned to Holyoke.   Bourque explained  to O'Connell\n\nthat she  entered the building  with the Holyoke  nurses for\n\nsafety and security reasons, and that she had not taken part\n\nin  any union  activity.   O'Connell replied  that he  would\n\nrelate  Bourque's  explanation  to  Cavanaugh,  but  advised\n\nBourque  that  Holyoke was  his  bread  and  butter  and  if\n\nCavanaugh wanted to stand by  her decision, she did not have\n\nto give  him any reason  for rejecting a  referred employee.\n\nO'Connell further cautioned  Bourque that she  should remain\n\nneutral and uninvolved  with the Holyoke employees.   A week\n\nlater, O'Connell informed Bourque that Cavanaugh  understood\n\nthe safety issue,  and that everything  was back to  normal.\n\nBourque was again referred to Holyoke on February 19, 1991.\n\n       Subsequently, Bourque  filed a charge  with the Board\n\nand the  Board's General Counsel  issued a complaint.   At a\n\nhearing   before  an  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ),  he\n\nrendered a decision  and recommended order holding  that the\n\nPetitioners were joint  employers under  the Act.   The  ALJ\n\nalso held that the Petitioners violated sections 8(a)(1) and\n\n(3)  of the  Act by  threatening and  denying employment  to\n\nBourque  because of  their  mistaken  belief  that  she  had\n\nassisted Holyoke's  employees in their  protected and  union\n\nactivities.   The Board  adopted the recommendations  of the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nALJ and ordered the Petitioners to cease and desist from the\n\nunfair  labor practices found and from infringing upon their\n\nemployees'  Section 7 rights.2  The Board also  required the\n\nPetitioners to make  Bourque whole for any  loss of earnings\n\nsuffered by her and to post an appropriate notice.\n\n                            II.\n\n       The  Petitioners  essentially  raise  two  issues  on\n\nappeal.  First, they contend that the Board erred in holding\n\nthat they are joint  employers of the employees  referred by\n\nO'Connell, Inc. to  Holyoke.  Second, the  Petitioners argue\n\nthat the Board  erred in ruling that  they violated sections\n\n8(a)(1)  and (3)  of  the  Act  by threatening  and  denying\n\nemployment to Bourque.\n\n                    A.

First, Holyoke had  the right to refuse to accept\n\nany  employee that it  did not want.   The record shows that\n\nHolyoke monitored the performance of  the referred employees\n\nand if an employee did not meet its standards, Holyoke could\n\nand  did require that O'Connell, Inc. refrain from referring\n\nthe employee again.  The record further shows that O'Connell\n\ncompletely deferred  to Holyoke's  demands concerning  which\n\nreferrals would be  accepted by Holyoke.   In fact,  Holyoke\n\nexercised  its power  in this  case to  refuse Bourque  as a\n\nreferral.  Second,  the record reveals that  Holyoke assumed\n\nsupervision  over  the  referred  employees.   The  referred\n\nemployees reported to Holyoke's office where they were given\n\ncertain supplies, the day's work assignment, a report on the\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npatients' conditions, and directions to the patients' homes.\n\nIf  referred employees encountered a problem during the day,\n\nthey were  instructed to  contact a  Holyoke supervisor  for\n\nadvice.   At  the end  of  the day,  the referred  employees\n\nreturned to the Holyoke office  and made a written report to\n\nHolyoke  of  their activities.    Moreover,  the Petitioners\n\nacknowledge that in the eyes of their patients, the referred\n\nnurses were regarded as Holyoke employees.\n\n       The   Petitioners  argue   that   with   professional\n\npersonnel, by definition, there may be direction as to where\n\nto go, but no control or  supervision as to \"how\" to do  the\n\nassignment   involved.  They   liken   this   case  to   the\n\nprofessional  drivers  discussed  by  the  Board  in  Laerco\n                                                            \n\nTransportation  &amp; Warehouse, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984),  in which\n                           \n\nthe  Board found that Laerco's supervision over the referred\n\nemployees was too routine to  make Laerco a joint  employer.\n\nAs discussed  above, however,  the supervision exercised  by\n\nHolyoke over  the O'Connell,  Inc. referrals  was more  than\n\nroutine.   That  the  referred  employees were  professional\n\nnurses who may not have  required much instruction as to how\n\nto  perform  their  work  does  not  negate  the  power   of\n\nsupervision and  direction that Holyoke  exercised over them\n\nonce they reported for work.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n       More important than the factual distinctions  between\n\ncases are  the specific facts  of this particular case.

The court found\n\nthat  the same cases cited  by Holyoke3 were not dispositive\n\nfor two reasons.  \n\n       First, because  the joint  employer issue  is\n       simply  a  factual  determination,  a  slight\n       difference  between  two cases  might  tilt a\n       case toward a finding of  a joint employment.\n       . . .

Thus, we accept the\n\nALJ's findings that Holyoke requested O'Connell, Inc. not to\n\nrefer Bourque  because  of Holyoke's  erroneous belief  that\n\nBourque  was  assisting  the  unionized  employees  in their\n\nprotected  demonstration;  that  O'Connell,  Inc.  willingly\n\ncomplied with  Holyoke's illegal request; and that O'Connell\n\nspecifically cautioned  Bourque not to involve  herself with\n\nthe  demonstrating  Holyoke  employees.     Once  the  ALJ's\n\ncredibility  findings  are  accepted,  there  is  more  than\n\nsufficient evidence to  support the Board's ruling  that the\n\nPetitioners both   violated sections 8(a)(1) and  (3) of the\n\nAct.\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\n       The final  determination set  forth  by  the ALJ  and\n\nupheld by the  Board relative to the  unfair labor practices\n\nis as follows:\n\n       The  facts  noted  above, show  that  Bourque\n       would have worked  at least some of  the days\n       that [Holyoke] used  referrals from O'Connell\n       in  the period between February 5, 1991, when\n       Bourque  was  released  by  her  doctor,  and\n       February  19,  1991  when  she  was  actually\n       assigned to [Holyoke].  The question  of just\n       how many days must  wait until the compliance\n       stage of this proceeding.\n\nThe  Petitioners  submit   that  the  above   conclusion  is\n\nspeculative and they  set forth testimony that,  they argue,\n\nshows that Bourque did not miss any days of work for Holyoke\n\ndue to their actions.  \n\n       To the contrary, the evidence creates an issue as  to\n\nhow many days,  if any, Bourque would have  been referred to\n\nHolyoke during the period that the Petitioners prevented her\n\nreferral.  Bourque  testified that her schedule  for working\n\nat  Holyoke was  arranged as  far as  three months  ahead of\n\ntime, or as short as the morning  of work.  In the past, she\n\nhad been  called the  day before  and even  at  9:00 in  the\n\nmorning of the  day she was to  work.  Therefore, the  Board\n\ndid  not err  in finding  that  Bourque may  be entitled  to\n\nbackpay  and that  the amount  of backpay  owing to  Bourque\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ncould  be   resolved,  if  necessary,   in  the   compliance\n\nproceeding following enforcement of the Board's order.\n\n       This  court has approved  the same  kind of order and\n\nprocedure in  a similar  situation.

Globe Mfg.\n                                                            \n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358149\"><a href=\"/opinion/358149/national-labor-relations-board-v-globe-manufacturing-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1978),  where an employer\n   \n\nhad imposed a  discriminatory recall policy on  an employee,\n\nthis  court upheld  a  Board  order  leaving  to  compliance\n\nproceedings the resolution  of whether the employee  in fact\n\nwould  have  been recalled  in  the absence  of  the illegal\n\npolicy.   The  court noted  that  it could  not rule  on the\n\ncompany's claim that the employee was unemployable under the\n\ncompany's standards,  and it refused to prolong  the case by\n\ndeclining enforcement  and remanding the  case.
