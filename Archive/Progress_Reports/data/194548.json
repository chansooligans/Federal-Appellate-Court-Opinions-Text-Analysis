In 1972 the  United States                                           \n\nbought eight acres  of land in Truro, Massachusetts,  to add\n\nto  the  Cape Cod  National  Seashore.   Unfortunately,  the\n\nseller,  Elizabeth Freeman,  owned only  a small  percentage\n\nshare  of the  eight  acres that  she  purported to  convey.\n\nElizabeth's  long-lived  great-grandfather, Edmund  Freeman,\n\n(whom  we shall call \"Edmund  the Elder\") had  owned 100% of\n\nthe  eight acres when he died in 1870, but, after his death,\n\nthe  property   descended,  through  inheritance,   to  many\n\ndifferent children,  grandchildren, and great-grandchildren,\n\neach  of whom  obtained  title to  various small  percentage\n\ninterests.\n\n          In  1984, plaintiff  Jean Stevenson  Clark brought\n\nthis action against the Government  to \"quiet title\" to what\n\nshe said was her percentage share in the property -- a share\n\nshe claimed to have  obtained from the grandchild of  one of\n\nElizabeth's aunts.  28 U.S.C.   2409a(a) (\"The United States\n\nmay  be named as  a party defendant in  a civil action under\n\nthis section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property\n\nin which the United States claims an interest\").  Five years\n\nlater four  grandchildren of a different  aunt intervened in\n\nthe lawsuit in order to assert similar claims of  ownership.\n\nEventually, the district court entered a judgment that tried\n\nto  sort  out  precisely   who  owned  what,  and   set  the\n\ncompensation that  plaintiff  and intervenors  must  receive\n\nshould the Government decide to  keep their interests in the\n\nproperty.  28 U.S.C.   2409a(b) (\"if the final determination\n\n[of the  plaintiff's 'quiet title' action]  shall be adverse\n\nto  the United  States, the  United States  nevertheless may\n\nretain such possession or control of the real property or of\n\nany  part thereof  as it  may elect,  upon payment  [of just\n\ncompensation] to the person  . . . entitled thereto\").   The\n\nGovernment now appeals this judgment, arguing primarily that\n\nthe district court  did not properly interpret or  apply the\n\nMassachusetts law of descent and distribution.\n\n          After the United States took this appeal, it filed\n\na complaint  in condemnation, pursuant  to 40 U.S.C.    257,\n\nagainst  the same property.   United States v.  8.0 Acres of                                                                         \n\nLand, No. 92-12663S  (D. Mass.  filed Nov. 5,  1992).   When                 \n\nthat  condemnation is  completed, the  Government will  take\n\nwhatever interests  in the eight  acres it does  not already\n\nown.  Because the  basic question in a \"quiet  title\" action\n\nis  \"who   owns   the  land,\"   and   because   condemnation\n\ndefinitively  answers this  question  for the  future (i.e.,\n\n\"the United  States does\"), we have had  to consider whether\n\n                            -3-                                          3\n\n(or  the  extent  to  which)  the  condemnation  action  has\n\n\"mooted\" this \"quiet title\" proceeding. \n\n          We   find  that   the  district   court  correctly\n\nallocated  certain  of  the   interests  in  dispute  (those\n\ninherited through  ancestors  named \"Charles\"  and  \"Richard\n\nSr.\"), but  that  it improperly  distributed  certain  other\n\ninterests (those derived from ancestors named \"Betsey I\" and\n\n\"Edmund II\").  We also  decide that the condemnation  action\n\n\"moots\" any further judicial efforts to allocate the \"Betsey\n\nI\" and \"Edmund II\" shares in  this \"quiet title\" proceeding.\n\nInstead,  the  district court  shall  decide  afresh who  is\n\nentitled to compensation for the  \"Betsey I\" and \"Edmund II\"\n\nshares in the context of the condemnation action now pending\n\nbefore it.\n\n                             I.\n\n                         Background                                                \n\n          With the  help of a  diagram (see Appendix  I) and                                                        \n\nthe  facts as  revealed by  the record  on appeal,  we shall\n\nretrace  the  parties'  contested  claims  and the  district\n\ncourt's determination  of them.   We begin  with Elizabeth's\n\ngreat-grandfather,  Edmund \"the Elder\" Freeman, who was born\n\nin 1780,  and who  died intestate  in 1870.   At  Edmund the\n\n                            -4-                                          4\n\nElder's death each of his three  surviving children, and his\n\ngrandchildren by  a fourth child, received  an undivided 25%\n\ninterest in the eight acres.   We shall refer to these  four\n\nsiblings as (1) \"Charles,\" (2)  \"Betsey I,\" (3) \"Edmund II,\"\n\nand  (4) \"Richard  Sr.\"   The  youngest  of these  siblings,\n\nRichard  Sr. (Elizabeth's  grandfather), died  in 1886.   He\n\nleft  his  25%  interest  to his  five  surviving  children,\n\nRichard Jr. (Elizabeth's father) and  her four aunts.   Each\n\nof these five thereby  obtained an undivided 5% interest  in\n\nthe property.  When Richard Jr. died in 1940, he left his 5%\n\ninterest to  his daughters Elizabeth and  Catherine, 2.5% to\n\neach.    Catherine  (wife  of  the  famous  Admiral  Nimetz)\n\nsubsequently conveyed to Elizabeth her vested  2.5% interest\n\n(and,  the court  found,  any inchoate  interests as  well).\n\nThus, Elizabeth,  at the time  she purported  to convey  the\n\neight acres to  the United States in 1972, undoubtedly owned\n\nat least a  5% share.  But did she own  any more, and if so,\n\nhow much?\n\n          The  \"quiet  title\" action  sought to  answer this\n\nquestion.   To  do so,  the court  had to  decide: (1)  What\n\nhappened to  the remaining 20%  of Richard Sr.'s  25% share?                                       \n\n(2) What happened  to the  other  75% interest  in the  land\n\n                            -5-                                          5\n\noriginally  inherited  by Richard  Sr.'s  three siblings  --\n\nCharles, Betsey I, and Edmund II -- 25% to each?\n\n                            -6-                                          6\n\n                             A.\n\n                  Richard Sr.'s 25% Share                                                      \n\n          The district court  had considerable  genealogical\n\ninformation about the line of Richard Sr.   As we have said,\n\nRichard Sr.  was survived by five  children, namely, Richard\n\nJr.  (Elizabeth's father), and  Elizabeth's four aunts, whom\n\nwe shall call, \"Betsey II,\" \"Ellen,\" \"Clara,\" and \"Ada.\"  As\n\nwe  have also said, Elizabeth obtained her father's 5%.  The\n\ndistrict  court found  that  the  remaining  20%  (initially\n\nbelonging  to  the  aunts)  descended  and  devised  through\n\nvarious routes,  some parts eventually coming  to Elizabeth,\n\nother  parts  ending  up  in the  hands  of  plaintiff  Jean\n\nStevenson   Clark  (who  took   her  interest  from  Clara's\n\ngrandchild, Phoebe), and still other  parts ending up in the\n\nhands of the intervenors, who are Ada's grandchildren.  \n\n          No one  contests this division (which is reflected\n\nin Appendix II) in  this appeal.  It is therefore final, and\n\nwe need not discuss these interests further.\n\n                             B.\n\n                     Charles' 25% Share                                                    \n\n          We  turn  next to  the  25%  interest ascribed  to\n\nCharles.  Charles died  in 1868, two years before  the death\n\n                            -7-                                          7\n\nof his father,  Edmund the Elder, in 1870.   Upon Edmund the\n\nElder's  death,  Charles'  children inherited  the  25% that\n\nwould have gone to Charles, had he outlived his father.  See\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 190,   3(1) (When an intestate dies seized\n\nof  land,  such land  descends  \"[i]n  equal shares  to  his\n\nchildren and to the  issue of any deceased child by right of\n\nrepresentation\").   Charles'  daughter Nancy  inherited this\n\nentire interest,  as she was Charles'  last surviving child,\n\nand her  siblings apparently died without issue.  Nancy died\n\nin  1931,  without any  surviving  children.   At  that time\n\nRichard Jr.,  who was Nancy's first  cousin (and Elizabeth's\n\nfather),  became the  administrator of  Nancy's estate.   He\n\ntold the probate court  that Nancy's next of kin  were three\n\nsurviving  first  cousins, namely  himself  and  two of  his\n\nsisters, Betsey II and Ada.  He added that Nancy had several\n\nliving cousins in the  next generation (i.e., in Elizabeth's                                        \n\ngeneration),  namely, several of  Edmund II's grandchildren.                                                                \n\nThe  probate court  subsequently distributed  Nancy's estate\n\n(including  the  25% interest  inherited through  her father\n\nCharles)  equally  to  Nancy's  living cousins  in  her  own                                                                         \n\ngeneration, namely Richard Jr., Betsey II, and Ada.  It thus\n\nawarded  each of  them an additional  8.33% interest  in the\n\nproperty.\n\n                            -8-                                          8\n\n          The district court in  this case accepted the 1931\n\njudgment    of   the   Massachusetts    probate   court   as\n\ndeterminative, and factored this  information into the chain\n\nof  conveyances and  devolutions.  (See Appendix  II).   The                                                    \n\nUnited  States,  through  Elizabeth,  received  her father's\n\n8.33%  interest plus  some  of both  Betsey  II's and  Ada's\n\nshares.  The  intervenors received the  rest of Ada's  8.33%\n\ninterest,  as well  as  some of  Betsey  II's share.    Jean\n\nStevenson Clark  received the tiny remainder  of Betsey II's\n\nshare.   The United States, though not arguing the matter at\n\nany length, seems to contest this division.\n\n                            C. \n\n  The 25% Share of Betsey I and the 25% Share of Edmund II                                                                       \n\n          The  district court  had  very little  information\n\nabout what happened to the lines of Edmund the Elder's other\n\ntwo children, Betsey I and Edmund II, each of whom inherited\n\na 25% interest  in the eight acres.  It  knew that Edmund II\n\nwas born in 18ll and that he had seven children.   The court\n\nalso  knew that  Betsey I  died in  1895, that  she had  ten\n\nchildren,  and that she was survived  at her death by two of\n\nher children and eleven grandchildren.  Finally, it had  the\n\n1931 probate court record  of Nancy's estate, which suggests\n\n                            -9-                                          9\n\nthat some of Edmund II's grandchildren  (who were members of\n\nElizabeth's generation) were still alive in 1931.    \n\n          The upshot is that the district court had evidence\n\nof the existence of twelve or more grandchildren of Betsey I\n\nand  Edmund   II,  as   of  1895   (eleven  of   Betsey  I's\n\ngrandchildren)  and 1931 (an  undetermined number  of Edmund\n\nII's  grandchildren).   These  individuals,  like Elizabeth,\n\nwere   great-grandchildren  of  Edmund  the  Elder.    Their\n\ndescendants (if they exist) might be entitled to a 50% share\n\nof the  property.    But, one  of the  intervenors told  the\n\ncourt, no one now knows anything about them.\n\n          Knowing  no  more than  this,  the  district court\n\nfaced three main possibilities.  First, Betsey I and  Edmund\n\nII  might have descendants still  alive.  If  so, then these\n\nsurviving  descendants  would own  (subject  to any  further\n\ntransactions)  their ancestors'  50% interest  in  the eight\n\nacres.\n\n          Second,  both lines  may have  died out,  but only\n\nafter Elizabeth died in 1977.  In that case, any descendants                  \n\nof Edmund the  Elder's two other heirs (namely,  Charles and\n\nRichard Sr.)  still alive  as of  1977 might  have inherited\n\ntheir   interests  (in  the  absence  of  such  complicating\n\nfeatures as, say, wills).  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 190,   3(6)                                           \n\n                            -10-                                          10\n\n(when an intestate dies seized of land and \"leaves no issue,\n\nand  no father, mother, brother  or sister, and  no issue of\n\nany deceased  brother or sister, then  [his estate descends]\n\nto his next  of kin  in equal  degree\").   According to  the\n\ndistrict court's uncontested findings, the  only descendants\n\nof  Charles or  Richard  Sr. to  survive Elizabeth  were her\n\nsister Catherine  and her aunt  Ada's grandchildren, Richard\n\nSr.'s great-grandchildren, namely, the intervenors.   (Since\n\nCatherine  had   conveyed  her  inchoate  interests  in  the\n\nproperty  to Elizabeth back in 1941, she was not eligible to\n\ninherit, even  though she outlived Elizabeth  by two years.)\n\nOn this hypothesis, therefore, Betsey  I and Edmund II's 50%\n\nshare would have devolved to the intervenors. \n\n          Third,  Betsey I  and Edmund  II's lines  may have\n\ndied out before Elizabeth's death in 1977.  In that case, to                            \n\ndetermine who obtained their interests (even if we assume no\n\nwills)  is yet more complex,  for it would  depend upon just\n\nwhen  they  died  and  which  members  of  their  generation\n\n(descended from Edmund the  Elder) were alive at  that time.\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch.  190,   3(6)  (\"if there are  two or more\n\ncollateral kindred in equal degree claiming [entitlement  to\n\nintestate next of  kin's land] through  different ancestors,\n\nthose  claiming   through  the  nearest  ancestor  shall  be\n\n                            -11-                                          11\n\npreferred   to  those  claiming  through  an  ancestor  more\n\nremote\"). \n\n          The   district   court,   choosing    the   second\n\npossibility,  concluded that  the two  lines died  out after                                                                         \n\nElizabeth's death in 1977.   It then awarded the  entire 50%\n\nto the  intervenors, dividing it  equally among the  four of\n\nthem.   The Government's appeal focuses  primarily upon this\n\ndetermination, which, the  Government contends,  incorrectly\n\napplies Massachusetts' law\n\nof descent and distribution.\n\n                            II.\n\n                      The Legal Merits                                                   \n\n          As we  have said,  the United States  contests the\n\nway  in which the district court  allocated ownership of the\n\n\"Charles\" line's 25% share, the \"Betsey I\" line's 25% share,\n\nand the \"Edmund II\"  line's 25% share.  We do not understand\n\nthe basis for its claim of  error in respect to the first of\n\nthese  matters,  a claim  that  it treats  cursorily  in its\n\nbrief.  In  1931 a Massachusetts probate court  decided that\n\nthis share  belonged to Richard  Sr.'s then-living children,\n\nnamely Richard Jr. (Elizabeth's father), Betsey II, and Ada.\n\nIt gave each  of them one-third of the share.   Ordinarily a\n\n                            -12-                                          12\n\nfederal court  will (indeed,  must) accept such  final state\n\ncourt  awards  as legally  binding.   See  28 U.S.C.    1738                                                      \n\n(\"judicial proceedings . . . of any court of any State . . .\n\nshall have the  same full  faith and credit  in every  court\n\nwithin the United States . . .  as they have by law or usage\n\nin the courts of such State\").  Cf. U.S. Const. art. IV,   1                                               \n\n(\"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in  each State to the\n\npublic  Acts,  Records, and  judicial  Proceedings of  every\n\nother State.\").  We are aware  of no special reason here for\n\ndeparting from  this general rule.   Consequently, we affirm\n\nthe district court's distribution of this 25% share.\n\n          We  do  not believe,  however,  that  the district\n\ncourt's awards  of the  other  two 25%  shares were  legally\n\ncorrect.  To  reach its  conclusions the court  had to  find\n\n(1) that all the descendants  of Betsey I and Edmund  II had\n\ndied  out by 1984, but  (2) that some  such descendants were\n\nalive as of Elizabeth's death in 1977.  The court had before\n\nit  a record that reveals no significant effort by anyone to                                                            \n\nsearch for, or to contact, by  publication or otherwise, any\n\ndescendants of the Betsey I or Edmund II lines.  (The court,\n\nin fact, rejected the plaintiff's motion for the appointment\n\nof a  guardian ad litem to  do precisely that.)   Rather the\n\nrecord contained only:\n\n                            -13-                                          13\n\n          (1) the facts  previously mentioned (namely,  that\n          Edmund II had grandchildren alive in 1931 and that\n          Betsey I had eleven grandchildren alive in 1895);\n\n          (2)  testimony  by  one  of  the  intervenors,  an\n          \"amateur  genealogist,\" that she  had no knowledge\n          of any issue of either Betsey I or Edmund II; \n\n          (3) testimony by a genealogist  for the Government\n          who  had primarily investigated Richard Sr.'s line                                                                         \n          that  he  had not  found  evidence  of any  living\n          descendants of Betsey I or Edmund II.\n\nThe  district  court  reasoned  from this  evidence  to  its\n\nconclusions   in  three   steps,  with   the  help   of  two\n\nMassachusetts cases,  Butrick v.  Tilton, 155 Mass.  461, 29                                                     \n\nN.E.  1088 (1892),  and  Loring v.  Steineman, 42  Mass. 204                                                          \n\n(1840).  \n\n          First,  Butrick  involved  plaintiffs who  claimed                                      \n\nthat  they, rather than a tenant, had title to real property\n\nthat the tenant occupied.  According  to the district court,\n\nButrick  held  that,  once  the  \"demandants\"  prove  \"their                    \n\nsuccession  to the  title,\" the  burden then  shifts to  the\n\ntenant to prove  the \"existence of  other heirs whose  title\n\nwould defeat or reduce  the claims of the demandants.\"   The\n\ndistrict  court   reasoned,  by   analogy,  that  once   the\n\nintervenors proved  \"their succession\"  to the Betsey  I and\n\nEdmund II interests, the burden  then shifted to the  United\n\nStates  to  show  the  \"existence of  other  heirs,\"  namely\n\ndescendants of those two lines.\n\n                            -14-                                          14\n\n          Second, the district court stated that Loring held                                                                    \n\n(1) that the  presumption of continued life persists  for no\n\nmore than seven  years after a person is last heard from, at\n\nwhich point a  \"presumption of death\"  arises, and (2)  that\n\nthose  claiming  that a  person  presumed  dead left  either\n\nspouse  or  children have  the burden  of  proving it.   The\n\ndistrict  court apparently  reasoned that  since no  one had\n\nheard of any descendant of Betsey I since at least 1895, nor\n\nof any descendant  of Edmund  II since at  least 1931,  that\n\nthese descendants (alive in 1895 and 1931) were \"presumed to\n\nhave died out.\"  The court also concluded that United States\n\nhad not proved the existence of any issue. \n\n          Third, the district court  noted that there \"is no\n\nindication  in the file that any attempt to locate the heirs\n\nof Betsey [I] or Edmund [II] was  made until this action was\n\nfiled [in 1984].\"  For this reason, the court concluded that\n\nthe two lines would be  presumed to have died out as  of the\n\n1984  filing date,  seven years  after Elizabeth's  death in                                                   \n\n1977.\n\n          We  do not  believe that  these cases  warrant the\n\nresult  now before  us.   For  one  thing, Butrick  involved                                                               \n\nplaintiffs  who established their \"succession\" to title with\n\nat least a  little more  evidence than was  present in  this\n\n                            -15-                                          15\n\ncase.    The  demandants  there obtained  title  from  their\n\nancestor, who  had allegedly  obtained title from  relatives\n\n(not the children) of a man  named Jacob Ayer, who had  died\n\nin 1789.  Jacob  Ayer, in turn, inherited his  interest from\n\nhis  father.   To  establish their  claim  to at  least some\n\nownership interest  in the  property, the plaintiffs  had to\n\nshow  that the relatives of Jacob Ayer had had title, which,\n\nin turn, required them  to show that Jacob Ayer  had left no\n\nissue.   Butrick, 155 Mass. at  465.  To establish  the full                             \n\nextent of Jacob Ayer's  interest in the property,  and hence\n\ntheir own, the  plaintiffs had to show that  Jacob's brother\n\nJoseph had died before  Jacob died, and without issue.   Id.                                                                        \n\nat 466. \n\n          To show the first of these matters, the plaintiffs\n\nprovided,  as a  witness,  Mrs. Butrick,  Jacob Ayer's  step\n\ngreat-granddaughter,   whom  the   court  held   (given  her\n\nrelationship  and interests)  competent  to  testify \"as  to\n\ngeneral repute . . . as to  matters of pedigree.\"  Id.  Mrs.                                                                  \n\nButrick  testified  that  Jacob's  second marriage  (to  her\n\ngreat-grandmother) produced no issue  and that she had never\n\nheard of any issue from Jacob's first marriage.  Id. at 465-                                                                \n\n66.  To  show the  second of these  matters, the  plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted  (1)  the  will  of  Jacob  Ayer's  father,  which\n\n                            -16-                                          16\n\nmentioned six children, including Jacob, but not his brother\n\nJoseph, and (2) \"evidence  of the unsuccessful inquiry where\n\nit was  probable that information  could be found  if Joseph\n\nhad  been living  up to 1810,\"  including an  examination of\n\nheadstones and  official records  in the  town where  he was\n\nborn.  Id. at 466-67.                         \n\n          The  evidence as  to  the first  of these  matters\n\n(Jacob's  lack of issue)  seems at  least a  little stronger\n\nthan the  comparable evidence here.  One can more reasonably\n\nbe expected to  know (as  in Butrick)  whether one's  (step)                                                 \n\ngreat-grandfather  had  children  than  to  know  (as  here)\n\nwhether one  has third cousins  who are still  living, i.e.,\n\nwhether one's great-grandfather had brothers or  sisters who\n\nhad children who had  children who had children who  are now\n\nalive.  The evidence  of the second of these  matters (i.e.,\n\nthe extinction of a  collateral line with a rival  claim) is\n\nmuch  stronger  in  Butrick  than here,  for  it  included a                                        \n\nserious search,  the failure of which  had obvious probative\n\nvalue.   The record in  this case, by  contrast, contains no\n\nevidence  of any significant effort to locate, or to provide\n\nnotice to,  the descendants of  Betsey I or  Edmund II.   Of\n\ncourse,  the Massachusetts  courts decided Butrick  nearly a                                                               \n\ncentury ago.  But in light of the technological improvements\n\n                            -17-                                          17\n\nwhich have made it  easier to track down  other individuals,\n\nwe believe Massachusetts courts  would insist, if  anything,\n\non  greater efforts  to locate  missing owners,  rather than                        \n\nneedlessly tolerate lesser efforts.                                         \n\n          We are also uncertain  about whether, or just how,\n\nLoring applies  here,  say, to  Edmund  II's  grandchildren.                   \n\nLoring involved a man who departed from where he lived, went                   \n\noff to sea, and who  was never heard of again by  his family\n\nand those  in his  native town.   Loring,  42 Mass.  at 206.                                                     \n\nEdmund II's grandchildren do not seem quite like the missing\n\nsailor,  however, for  there is  no  reason to  believe that\n\nthose with whom they lived never \"heard of\" them after 1931.\n\nSee Knapp v.  Graham, 320  Mass. 50, 54  (1946) (rival  heir                                 \n\nwill not be  presumed dead where no proof of actual death or\n\nunexplained  absence from  domicil or  established residence\n\nfor  more than seven  years).  The  only reason we  have not                                                               \n\nheard  of them again, as far as  the record reveals, is that\n\nno one has attempted to look for them.   \n\n          Regardless, we  do not see how  Loring (whether or                                                             \n\nnot taken together with  Butrick) could justify the district                                             \n\ncourt's conclusion that  the two lines died  out after 1977.                                                                        \n\nIf we accept, for the sake of argument, that Loring's \"seven                                                                \n\nyear\"  presumption applies,  then we  would have  to presume\n\n                            -18-                                          18\n\nthat Betsey  I's grandchildren  were no longer  living seven\n\nyears  after  1895, when,  according  to  the record,  their\n\nexistence was last documented.   Similarly, we would have to\n\npresume that Edmund II's  grandchildren were no longer alive\n\nseven  years  after 1931.   Were  that  so (and  assuming no\n\nissue), the  intervenors would  not inherit the  lost heirs'\n\nentire interests, because others (including Richard Jr., the\n\nfather of Elizabeth, the Government's grantor) were alive in\n\n1902 and/or 1938, and thus entitled  to a share.  The record\n\nis  totally silent  as to  whether Betsey  I or  Edmund II's\n\ngrandchildren  produced issue.   And,  we do  not understand\n\nwhat rule of law would permit the court to presume both that                                                                    \n\nthese grandchildren  (and  any issue  they  produced)  still\n\nexisted in 1977  and that they died  (without issue) shortly                                 \n\nafter 1977.\n\n          For  these reasons, we conclude that Massachusetts\n\nlaw, as it applies  to the facts before us, does not support\n\nthe district court's award  of 50% of the locus  (consisting\n\nof  Betsey I's 25% interest and Edmund II's 25% interest) to\n\nthe  intervenors.   We  therefore must  vacate the  judgment\n\nbelow  insofar as it makes that  award.  We need not further\n\ndecide precisely how Massachusetts law ought to apply to the\n\n                            -19-                                          19\n\nexisting record because,  for reasons  set out  in Part  III\n\nbelow, the relevant facts may change. \n\n                            -20-                                          20\n\n                            III.\n\n                    Further Proceedings                                                    \n\n          As noted above, the United States has filed, while\n\nthis appeal was  pending before this  court, a complaint  in\n\ncondemnation against the  eight acres at issue  here.  After\n\noral  argument on  appeal,  the United  States  asked us  to\n\nvacate the judgment below so that the district court, in the\n\ncondemnation  action,  can  determine compensable  ownership\n\ninterests on  a clean slate.   We see no basis  for vacating\n\nthe judgment below, however,  insofar as that decision makes\n\na final award of interests.  The judgment below is obviously                    \n\n\"final\"  with respect to Richard Sr.'s 25% share, for no one\n\nhas appealed  from that  award. See Restatement  (Second) of                                                                         \n\nJudgments,    13 cmt. e (\"A  judgment may be final  in a res                      \n\njudicata  sense  as to  a  part of  an action  [or  a claim]\n\nalthough the litigation continues  as to the rest\").   It is\n\nalso  \"final\"  with  respect  to Charles'  25%  share,  for,\n\nalthough the  United States has appealed that award, we have\n\nfound no legal reason  to disturb it. See id. at   13 cmt. f                                                         \n\n(\"a judgment  otherwise final remains so  despite the taking\n\nof  an appeal . . . .   finality [not being] affected by the\n\nfact  that  the taking  of  the appeal  [may]  prevent[] its\n\nexecution  or enforcement\").   And,  we do  not believe  the\n\n                            -21-                                          21\n\nUnited  States  should  be  able automatically  to  avoid  a\n\ndistrict  court's  \"quiet  title\"  judgment  with  which  it\n\ndisagrees simply  by appealing it and  filing a condemnation\n\npetition  in  the interim.   Here,  it  seems both  fair and\n\npotentially  expeditious  for  the  district  court's \"quiet\n\ntitle\"   allocation  of  Charles's   share  to   govern  the\n\ncondemnation action's compensation  decisions (as they  will\n\nin the  case  of  Richard Sr.'s  share).  See id.  at     27                                                             \n\n(setting forth the basic principle of collateral estoppel).\n\n          Since we  vacate the judgment below  in respect to\n\nthe rest  of the  \"quiet title\" action,  which concerns  the\n\ndistribution  of the Betsey I and Edmund II shares, there is\n\nno  final judgment  in effect regarding  those shares.   And                               \n\nbecause  we  find  that  condemnation  will  eliminate   the\n\nrequisite controversy as to who owns the Betsey I and Edmund\n\nII shares,  we  order  the district  court  to  dismiss  the\n\ncomplaint in respect to the vacated portions as \"moot.\"  The\n\ndistrict court  should determine  afresh whom  to compensate\n\nfor those shares in the context of the separate condemnation\n\naction.   Because  we have  found  authority from  a  sister\n\ncircuit  that  casts  doubt  upon  our  finding  of  partial\n\nmootness, and because  the plaintiff and  intervenors oppose\n\nvacatur, we shall explain our reasoning in some detail.\n\n                            -22-                                          22\n\n          At the outset,  one must understand  a few of  the\n\ntechnical differences  between a \"quiet title\"  action and a\n\n\"condemnation\" proceeding.  A condemnation action is brought\n\nby the  Government and proceeds in rem  against the property                                                   \n\nitself.  See United States v.

If the plaintiff prevails, he can\n\nrecover the land  wrongly held  by the United  States.   The\n\nQuiet  Title  Act  also  permits the  Government  to  retain\n\nproperty it does not own, but only after a court has reached                                                     \n\na \"final determination\" in the title dispute \"adverse to the\n\nUnited States.\"   Id. at    2409a(b).   At  that point,  the                                 \n\nUnited States  can elect to keep  the prevailing plaintiff's\n\ninterest in the  land by paying him  \"just compensation\" for\n\nit.    Id.   Yet  even if  the  United  States acquires  the                      \n\nplaintiff's interest,  it  will nonetheless  be  potentially\n\nliable  to third parties not  joined in the  action, who may\n\nhave  better   title  than  either  the   plaintiff  or  the\n\nGovernment.  See, e.g., Younce v. United States, 661 F.

The Quiet Title Act  authorizes only actions that\n\nrequire  courts  \"to adjudicate  a  disputed  title to  real                                                         \n\nproperty in which the  United States claims an interest  . .\n\n. .\"  28 U.S.C.   2409a(a)  (emphasis added).   The words of\n\nthe statute, taken literally, permit adjudications only when\n\nthe title  or ownership of real  property is in doubt.

United States,  707 F.2d 91, 93 (4th  Cir. 1983)                                      \n\n(landlord cannot  maintain     2409a  \"quiet  title\"  action\n\nagainst United States in  dispute over Government's  alleged\n\n                            -25-                                          25\n\nbreach of  contractual obligations  as  tenant under  lease,\n\nsince  dispute does not cast doubt on the title or ownership\n\nof  the property).  The  initial inquiry in  any such action\n\nmust therefore be, \"Who holds superior title to the property\n\n-- the plaintiff or the United States?\"  Only if the  courts\n\nfinally resolve  the title dispute  in a manner  \"adverse to\n\nthe  United  States\"  (i.e.,  the  plaintiff  holds superior\n\ntitle) will they reach a  second question, \"Does the  United\n\nStates  wish to  keep  the  plaintiff's  property  interest,\n\nregardless,  by paying just compensation for it?\"   Once the\n\nproperty  has been  condemned,  however,  the \"quiet  title\"\n\ncourt cannot make  a \"final determination\" as  to title that\n\nis \"adverse  to the United States.\"   The condemnation gives\n\nthe  United States  indefeasible title.   Hence,  the \"quiet\n\ntitle\" action's first question  -- \"Who has superior title?\"\n\n-- is preclusively determined in the United States' favor. \n\n          The upshot is that  the filing of the condemnation\n\naction has  eliminated the prerequisite for  a \"quiet title\"\n\naction -- a  \"disputed title\"  -- and  thereby \"mooted\"  its\n\nthreshold inquiry, \"Who  owns title?\"  For this  reason, the\n\nunresolved  portion  of  this  \"quiet  title\"  action cannot\n\ncontinue.\n\n                            -26-                                          26\n\n          Strong   practical   considerations  support   our\n\ntechnical reading.  A condemnation action seems to provide a\n\nmore effective  way than a  \"quiet title\" action  to deliver\n\njust  compensation  to  those private  persons  entitled  to\n\nreceive it.   \"Quiet title\" procedures  do not automatically\n\nprovide for  the notification of  persons not  party to  the\n\naction (e.g., the  \"lost\" descendants of Betsey I and Edmund\n\nII) who may have  title superior to both plaintiffs  and the\n\nGovernment.     Thus,  the  true  owners   may  not  receive\n\ncompensation, and  a court,  wrongly believing that  they do\n\nnot  exist, may order  the Government to  pay the plaintiffs                \n\nfull compensation, thereby exposing the Government to double\n\nliability should the true owners eventually surface and sue.\n\n          The  procedures  for  condemnation,  by  contrast,\n\nexpressly require the Government to take steps to search for\n\n\"lost\" heirs.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2) (\"prior to any                               \n\nhearing involving the compensation to be paid for a piece of\n\n[condemned]   property,   the  [condemnor]   shall   add  as\n\ndefendants  all  persons having  . .  .  an interest  in the\n\nproperty  whose names  can  be ascertained  by a  reasonably\n\ndiligent search of the records,  . . . and also  those whose\n\nnames have  otherwise been learned.\").   As a  result, these\n\n                            -27-                                          27\n\nprocedures tend to compensate those entitled to compensation\n\nand to protect  the Government from double liability.   They\n\nalso make it less  likely that the Government will  obtain a\n\nwindfall, for example, by  physically occupying land it does\n\nnot  own, and  whose  unknown owners  never  bring a  \"quiet\n\ntitle\" action to obtain payment; the Government must pay the\n\nentire value  of the condemned property  into court, whether\n\nor not it has ascertained who owns it.  See United States v.                                                                      \n\n3276.21  Acres of  Land, 194  F. Supp.  297, 300  (S.D.

And,  the court\n\napparently  retains  a  degree  of freedom  to  divide  this\n\ncompensation (and to condition its distribution) in a manner\n\nthat seems  fair, in light  of the  possibility that  \"lost\"\n\nheirs  may eventually  appear.  See, e.g., United  States v.                                                                      \n\n550.6 Acres  of Land,  etc, 68  F. Supp.  151, 154 (D.

In Fulcher, a                                                                      \n\nplaintiff  brought a   2409a action in 1977 to \"quiet title\"\n\nto  property  which  the Government  had  condemned eighteen\n\n                            -29-                                          29\n\nyears earlier, in 1959,  without properly notifying him.   A\n\nmajority of the  Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc,  held that\n\nthe  1959  condemnation  vested indefeasible  title  in  the\n\nGovernment.  Fulcher,  632 F.2d at  284 (plurality); id.  at                                                                    \n\n294 (Hall, concurring in part  and dissenting in party); id.                                                                        \n\nat 295  (Murnaghan, dissenting).   Yet a majority  also held\n\nthat  the plaintiff  could  nonetheless maintain  a    2409a\n\n\"quiet title\"  action in  order to obtain  just compensation\n\nfor the  Government's appropriation of his  property.

The                                 \n\nCircuit reached this result  even though the plaintiff could\n\nhave sought compensation  in the Court of  Claims (now known\n\nas  the United  States Claims Court)  by bringing  a takings\n\nclaim  under the Tucker Act.  28 U.S.C.    1491 (\"The United\n\nStates Claims  Courts  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  render\n\njudgment upon any  claim against the United States founded .\n\n.  . upon the Constitution\").

The  Fulcher                                                                         \n\nplurality,  for example,  focused  primarily  on  whether  a\n\nplaintiff could sue for compensation in a highly convenient,\n\nlocal  \"quiet title\" forum,  or would, instead,  have to sue\n\nfor  compensation  (under  the   Tucker  Act)  in  the  less\n\nconvenient  Court of Claims.  Fulcher, 632 F.2d at 282, 285-                                                  \n\n86  (plurality).   Here,  by  contrast,  the plaintiffs  can\n\nobtain compensation in the local district court even without\n\nthe  Quiet  Title  Act, and  other  practical considerations\n\nargue strongly in favor of  ending the \"quiet title\"  action\n\nand proceeding henceforth in condemnation.\n\n          The Fulcher plurality also developed a theory that                                  \n\nthe   plaintiff  (not  properly   notified  in  the  earlier\n\ncondemnation  action)   had  a  kind   of  \"equitable  lien\"\n\nenforceable  in a later \"quiet title\" action.  Id. at 284-85                                                              \n\n(plurality).   That theory  is not  applicable here,  as the\n\n                            -31-                                          31\n\nnamed  plaintiffs   have  all   been   notified  about   the\n\ncondemnation complaint.\n\n          Rather  than distinguish  Fulcher on  grounds that                                                        \n\nmay further complicate this complex area of law, however, we\n\nbelieve it more straightforward to say that we disagree with\n\nits reasoning.  At bottom, the Fulcher plurality interpreted                                                   \n\nthe \"quiet title\" statute as allowing the  post-condemnation\n\nsuit because  (1) of  policy  grounds favoring  adjudicating\n\nproperty-related  disputes  in  nearby courts,  and  (2) its\n\ninability   to  find   strong   reasons   against  such   an\n\ninterpretation.    Indeed,  it wrote  that  it  \"perceive[d]\n\nneither  congressional  intent  nor  principled  reason  for\n\ndistinguishing\"  between  \"takings\" effected  without formal                                                                  \n\ncondemnation  proceedings  (which,  if  made  without proper\n\ncompensation, can give rise to \"quiet title\" actions  by the\n\nuncompensated owners  for payment) and \"takings\" arising out                                                                     \n\nof formal  condemnation proceedings (which, if  made without\n\nproper  compensation,  can  give  rise to  Court  of  Claims\n\nproceedings for payment).  Id. at 284 (plurality).                                          \n\n          We do see a crucial distinction,  however, between\n\nbringing  a \"quiet  title\" action  where title  is still  in\n\ndispute  and  bringing  a  \"quiet title\"  action  after  the\n\nGovernment   has   indisputably   obtained   title   through\n\n                            -32-                                          32\n\ncondemnation.  This  distinction, as we  have said, lies  in\n\nthe  theory  of  the \"quiet  title\"  suit  as  an action  to\n\nadjudicate  disputed  title,  and  in the  language  of  the\n\nfederal  \"quiet  title\"  statute  itself.      That  statute\n\nprovides that  the Government  may retain real  property (by\n\npaying  just compensation) only  \"if the final determination                                                                         \n\n[of the underlying 'quiet title' action] shall be adverse to                                                                      \n\nthe  United States . .  . .\" 28  U.S.C.   2409a(b) (emphasis\n\nadded).   Where the United States  has indisputably obtained\n\ntitle,  it is difficult to  see how this  condition could be\n\nfulfilled.  So even though, as the Fulcher plurality stated,                                                       \n\nthe  legislative   history  of  the  Quiet   Title  Act  \"is\n\ninconclusive about  claims of omitted owners  arising out of\n\nformal condemnation  proceedings,\" Fulcher, 632  F.2d at 284                                                       \n\n(plurality), the language of the statute, and its underlying\n\nlogic, are not. \n\n          A   second   consideration   that  threatens   our\n\nconclusion  of   \"mootness\"  lies  in  the   fact  that  the\n\nGovernment has not  yet paid  an amount deemed  to be  \"just\n\ncompensation\"  into court.   As  the  case law  makes clear,\n\ntitle shifts upon payment  of this amount, not before.   See                                                                         \n\nAlbert Hanson Lumber Co.,  261 U.S. at 587; 341.45  Acres of                                                                         \n\nLand, 751  F.2d at  926 n.2.

We surmise  that it  has  held up  actual payment\n\npending our  decision in  this appeal.   We  shall therefore\n\neliminate this \"chicken and egg\" problem by conditioning our\n\njudgment, insofar  as it  orders the remanded  \"quiet title\"\n\naction to be dismissed, upon the Government's payment of the\n\ncondemnation award into the district court.\n\n                            IV.\n\n                        The Judgment                                                 \n\n          1.

In 1972 the  United States                                           \n\nbought eight acres  of land in Truro, Massachusetts,  to add\n\nto  the  Cape Cod  National  Seashore.   Unfortunately,  the\n\nseller,  Elizabeth Freeman,  owned only  a small  percentage\n\nshare  of the  eight  acres that  she  purported to  convey.\n\nElizabeth's  long-lived  great-grandfather, Edmund  Freeman,\n\n(whom  we shall call \"Edmund  the Elder\") had  owned 100% of\n\nthe  eight acres when he died in 1870, but, after his death,\n\nthe  property   descended,  through  inheritance,   to  many\n\ndifferent children,  grandchildren, and great-grandchildren,\n\neach  of whom  obtained  title to  various small  percentage\n\ninterests.\n\n          In  1984, plaintiff  Jean Stevenson  Clark brought\n\nthis action against the Government  to \"quiet title\" to what\n\nshe said was her percentage share in the property -- a share\n\nshe claimed to have  obtained from the grandchild of  one of\n\nElizabeth's aunts.  28 U.S.C.   2409a(a) (\"The United States\n\nmay  be named as  a party defendant in  a civil action under\n\nthis section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property\n\nin which the United States claims an interest\").  Five years\n\nlater four  grandchildren of a different  aunt intervened in\n\nthe lawsuit in order to assert similar claims of  ownership.\n\nEventually, the district court entered a judgment that tried\n\nto  sort  out  precisely   who  owned  what,  and   set  the\n\ncompensation that  plaintiff  and intervenors  must  receive\n\nshould the Government decide to  keep their interests in the\n\nproperty.  28 U.S.C.   2409a(b) (\"if the final determination\n\n[of the  plaintiff's 'quiet title' action]  shall be adverse\n\nto  the United  States, the  United States  nevertheless may\n\nretain such possession or control of the real property or of\n\nany  part thereof  as it  may elect,  upon payment  [of just\n\ncompensation] to the person  . . . entitled thereto\").   The\n\nGovernment now appeals this judgment, arguing primarily that\n\nthe district court  did not properly interpret or  apply the\n\nMassachusetts law of descent and distribution.\n\n          After the United States took this appeal, it filed\n\na complaint  in condemnation, pursuant  to 40 U.S.C.    257,\n\nagainst  the same property.   United States v.  8.0 Acres of                                                                         \n\nLand, No. 92-12663S  (D. Mass.  filed Nov. 5,  1992).   When                 \n\nthat  condemnation is  completed, the  Government will  take\n\nwhatever interests  in the eight  acres it does  not already\n\nown.  Because the  basic question in a \"quiet  title\" action\n\nis  \"who   owns   the  land,\"   and   because   condemnation\n\ndefinitively  answers this  question  for the  future (i.e.,\n\n\"the United  States does\"), we have had  to consider whether\n\n                            -3-                                          3\n\n(or  the  extent  to  which)  the  condemnation  action  has\n\n\"mooted\" this \"quiet title\" proceeding. \n\n          We   find  that   the  district   court  correctly\n\nallocated  certain  of  the   interests  in  dispute  (those\n\ninherited through  ancestors  named \"Charles\"  and  \"Richard\n\nSr.\"), but  that  it improperly  distributed  certain  other\n\ninterests (those derived from ancestors named \"Betsey I\" and\n\n\"Edmund II\").  We also  decide that the condemnation  action\n\n\"moots\" any further judicial efforts to allocate the \"Betsey\n\nI\" and \"Edmund II\" shares in  this \"quiet title\" proceeding.\n\nInstead,  the  district court  shall  decide  afresh who  is\n\nentitled to compensation for the  \"Betsey I\" and \"Edmund II\"\n\nshares in the context of the condemnation action now pending\n\nbefore it.\n\n                             I.\n\n                         Background                                                \n\n          With the  help of a  diagram (see Appendix  I) and                                                        \n\nthe  facts as  revealed by  the record  on appeal,  we shall\n\nretrace  the  parties'  contested  claims  and the  district\n\ncourt's determination  of them.   We begin  with Elizabeth's\n\ngreat-grandfather,  Edmund \"the Elder\" Freeman, who was born\n\nin 1780,  and who  died intestate  in 1870.   At  Edmund the\n\n                            -4-                                          4\n\nElder's death each of his three  surviving children, and his\n\ngrandchildren by  a fourth child, received  an undivided 25%\n\ninterest in the eight acres.   We shall refer to these  four\n\nsiblings as (1) \"Charles,\" (2)  \"Betsey I,\" (3) \"Edmund II,\"\n\nand  (4) \"Richard  Sr.\"   The  youngest  of these  siblings,\n\nRichard  Sr. (Elizabeth's  grandfather), died  in 1886.   He\n\nleft  his  25%  interest  to his  five  surviving  children,\n\nRichard Jr. (Elizabeth's father) and  her four aunts.   Each\n\nof these five thereby  obtained an undivided 5% interest  in\n\nthe property.  When Richard Jr. died in 1940, he left his 5%\n\ninterest to  his daughters Elizabeth and  Catherine, 2.5% to\n\neach.    Catherine  (wife  of  the  famous  Admiral  Nimetz)\n\nsubsequently conveyed to Elizabeth her vested  2.5% interest\n\n(and,  the court  found,  any inchoate  interests as  well).\n\nThus, Elizabeth,  at the time  she purported  to convey  the\n\neight acres to  the United States in 1972, undoubtedly owned\n\nat least a  5% share.  But did she own  any more, and if so,\n\nhow much?\n\n          The  \"quiet  title\" action  sought to  answer this\n\nquestion.   To  do so,  the court  had to  decide: (1)  What\n\nhappened to  the remaining 20%  of Richard Sr.'s  25% share?                                       \n\n(2) What happened  to the  other  75% interest  in the  land\n\n                            -5-                                          5\n\noriginally  inherited  by Richard  Sr.'s  three siblings  --\n\nCharles, Betsey I, and Edmund II -- 25% to each?\n\n                            -6-                                          6\n\n                             A.\n\n                  Richard Sr.'s 25% Share                                                      \n\n          The district court  had considerable  genealogical\n\ninformation about the line of Richard Sr.   As we have said,\n\nRichard Sr.  was survived by five  children, namely, Richard\n\nJr.  (Elizabeth's father), and  Elizabeth's four aunts, whom\n\nwe shall call, \"Betsey II,\" \"Ellen,\" \"Clara,\" and \"Ada.\"  As\n\nwe  have also said, Elizabeth obtained her father's 5%.  The\n\ndistrict  court found  that  the  remaining  20%  (initially\n\nbelonging  to  the  aunts)  descended  and  devised  through\n\nvarious routes,  some parts eventually coming  to Elizabeth,\n\nother  parts  ending  up  in the  hands  of  plaintiff  Jean\n\nStevenson   Clark  (who  took   her  interest  from  Clara's\n\ngrandchild, Phoebe), and still other  parts ending up in the\n\nhands of the intervenors, who are Ada's grandchildren.  \n\n          No one  contests this division (which is reflected\n\nin Appendix II) in  this appeal.  It is therefore final, and\n\nwe need not discuss these interests further.\n\n                             B.\n\n                     Charles' 25% Share                                                    \n\n          We  turn  next to  the  25%  interest ascribed  to\n\nCharles.  Charles died  in 1868, two years before  the death\n\n                            -7-                                          7\n\nof his father,  Edmund the Elder, in 1870.   Upon Edmund the\n\nElder's  death,  Charles'  children inherited  the  25% that\n\nwould have gone to Charles, had he outlived his father.  See\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 190,   3(1) (When an intestate dies seized\n\nof  land,  such land  descends  \"[i]n  equal shares  to  his\n\nchildren and to the  issue of any deceased child by right of\n\nrepresentation\").   Charles'  daughter Nancy  inherited this\n\nentire interest,  as she was Charles'  last surviving child,\n\nand her  siblings apparently died without issue.  Nancy died\n\nin  1931,  without any  surviving  children.   At  that time\n\nRichard Jr.,  who was Nancy's first  cousin (and Elizabeth's\n\nfather),  became the  administrator of  Nancy's estate.   He\n\ntold the probate court  that Nancy's next of kin  were three\n\nsurviving  first  cousins, namely  himself  and  two of  his\n\nsisters, Betsey II and Ada.  He added that Nancy had several\n\nliving cousins in the  next generation (i.e., in Elizabeth's                                        \n\ngeneration),  namely, several of  Edmund II's grandchildren.                                                                \n\nThe  probate court  subsequently distributed  Nancy's estate\n\n(including  the  25% interest  inherited through  her father\n\nCharles)  equally  to  Nancy's  living cousins  in  her  own                                                                         \n\ngeneration, namely Richard Jr., Betsey II, and Ada.  It thus\n\nawarded  each of  them an additional  8.33% interest  in the\n\nproperty.\n\n                            -8-                                          8\n\n          The district court in  this case accepted the 1931\n\njudgment    of   the   Massachusetts    probate   court   as\n\ndeterminative, and factored this  information into the chain\n\nof  conveyances and  devolutions.  (See Appendix  II).   The                                                    \n\nUnited  States,  through  Elizabeth,  received  her father's\n\n8.33%  interest plus  some  of both  Betsey  II's and  Ada's\n\nshares.  The  intervenors received the  rest of Ada's  8.33%\n\ninterest,  as well  as  some of  Betsey  II's share.    Jean\n\nStevenson Clark  received the tiny remainder  of Betsey II's\n\nshare.   The United States, though not arguing the matter at\n\nany length, seems to contest this division.\n\n                            C. \n\n  The 25% Share of Betsey I and the 25% Share of Edmund II                                                                       \n\n          The  district court  had  very little  information\n\nabout what happened to the lines of Edmund the Elder's other\n\ntwo children, Betsey I and Edmund II, each of whom inherited\n\na 25% interest  in the eight acres.  It  knew that Edmund II\n\nwas born in 18ll and that he had seven children.   The court\n\nalso  knew that  Betsey I  died in  1895, that  she had  ten\n\nchildren,  and that she was survived  at her death by two of\n\nher children and eleven grandchildren.  Finally, it had  the\n\n1931 probate court record  of Nancy's estate, which suggests\n\n                            -9-                                          9\n\nthat some of Edmund II's grandchildren  (who were members of\n\nElizabeth's generation) were still alive in 1931.    \n\n          The upshot is that the district court had evidence\n\nof the existence of twelve or more grandchildren of Betsey I\n\nand  Edmund   II,  as   of  1895   (eleven  of   Betsey  I's\n\ngrandchildren)  and 1931 (an  undetermined number  of Edmund\n\nII's  grandchildren).   These  individuals,  like Elizabeth,\n\nwere   great-grandchildren  of  Edmund  the  Elder.    Their\n\ndescendants (if they exist) might be entitled to a 50% share\n\nof the  property.    But, one  of the  intervenors told  the\n\ncourt, no one now knows anything about them.\n\n          Knowing  no  more than  this,  the  district court\n\nfaced three main possibilities.  First, Betsey I and  Edmund\n\nII  might have descendants still  alive.  If  so, then these\n\nsurviving  descendants  would own  (subject  to any  further\n\ntransactions)  their ancestors'  50% interest  in  the eight\n\nacres.\n\n          Second,  both lines  may have  died out,  but only\n\nafter Elizabeth died in 1977.  In that case, any descendants                  \n\nof Edmund the  Elder's two other heirs (namely,  Charles and\n\nRichard Sr.)  still alive  as of  1977 might  have inherited\n\ntheir   interests  (in  the  absence  of  such  complicating\n\nfeatures as, say, wills).  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 190,   3(6)                                           \n\n                            -10-                                          10\n\n(when an intestate dies seized of land and \"leaves no issue,\n\nand  no father, mother, brother  or sister, and  no issue of\n\nany deceased  brother or sister, then  [his estate descends]\n\nto his next  of kin  in equal  degree\").   According to  the\n\ndistrict court's uncontested findings, the  only descendants\n\nof  Charles or  Richard  Sr. to  survive Elizabeth  were her\n\nsister Catherine  and her aunt  Ada's grandchildren, Richard\n\nSr.'s great-grandchildren, namely, the intervenors.   (Since\n\nCatherine  had   conveyed  her  inchoate  interests  in  the\n\nproperty  to Elizabeth back in 1941, she was not eligible to\n\ninherit, even  though she outlived Elizabeth  by two years.)\n\nOn this hypothesis, therefore, Betsey  I and Edmund II's 50%\n\nshare would have devolved to the intervenors. \n\n          Third,  Betsey I  and Edmund  II's lines  may have\n\ndied out before Elizabeth's death in 1977.  In that case, to                            \n\ndetermine who obtained their interests (even if we assume no\n\nwills)  is yet more complex,  for it would  depend upon just\n\nwhen  they  died  and  which  members  of  their  generation\n\n(descended from Edmund the  Elder) were alive at  that time.\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch.  190,   3(6)  (\"if there are  two or more\n\ncollateral kindred in equal degree claiming [entitlement  to\n\nintestate next of  kin's land] through  different ancestors,\n\nthose  claiming   through  the  nearest  ancestor  shall  be\n\n                            -11-                                          11\n\npreferred   to  those  claiming  through  an  ancestor  more\n\nremote\"). \n\n          The   district   court,   choosing    the   second\n\npossibility,  concluded that  the two  lines died  out after                                                                         \n\nElizabeth's death in 1977.   It then awarded the  entire 50%\n\nto the  intervenors, dividing it  equally among the  four of\n\nthem.   The Government's appeal focuses  primarily upon this\n\ndetermination, which, the  Government contends,  incorrectly\n\napplies Massachusetts' law\n\nof descent and distribution.\n\n                            II.\n\n                      The Legal Merits                                                   \n\n          As we  have said,  the United States  contests the\n\nway  in which the district court  allocated ownership of the\n\n\"Charles\" line's 25% share, the \"Betsey I\" line's 25% share,\n\nand the \"Edmund II\"  line's 25% share.  We do not understand\n\nthe basis for its claim of  error in respect to the first of\n\nthese  matters,  a claim  that  it treats  cursorily  in its\n\nbrief.  In  1931 a Massachusetts probate court  decided that\n\nthis share  belonged to Richard  Sr.'s then-living children,\n\nnamely Richard Jr. (Elizabeth's father), Betsey II, and Ada.\n\nIt gave each  of them one-third of the share.   Ordinarily a\n\n                            -12-                                          12\n\nfederal court  will (indeed,  must) accept such  final state\n\ncourt  awards  as legally  binding.   See  28 U.S.C.    1738                                                      \n\n(\"judicial proceedings . . . of any court of any State . . .\n\nshall have the  same full  faith and credit  in every  court\n\nwithin the United States . . .  as they have by law or usage\n\nin the courts of such State\").  Cf. U.S. Const. art. IV,   1                                               \n\n(\"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in  each State to the\n\npublic  Acts,  Records, and  judicial  Proceedings of  every\n\nother State.\").  We are aware  of no special reason here for\n\ndeparting from  this general rule.   Consequently, we affirm\n\nthe district court's distribution of this 25% share.\n\n          We  do  not believe,  however,  that  the district\n\ncourt's awards  of the  other  two 25%  shares were  legally\n\ncorrect.  To  reach its  conclusions the court  had to  find\n\n(1) that all the descendants  of Betsey I and Edmund  II had\n\ndied  out by 1984, but  (2) that some  such descendants were\n\nalive as of Elizabeth's death in 1977.  The court had before\n\nit  a record that reveals no significant effort by anyone to                                                            \n\nsearch for, or to contact, by  publication or otherwise, any\n\ndescendants of the Betsey I or Edmund II lines.  (The court,\n\nin fact, rejected the plaintiff's motion for the appointment\n\nof a  guardian ad litem to  do precisely that.)   Rather the\n\nrecord contained only:\n\n                            -13-                                          13\n\n          (1) the facts  previously mentioned (namely,  that\n          Edmund II had grandchildren alive in 1931 and that\n          Betsey I had eleven grandchildren alive in 1895);\n\n          (2)  testimony  by  one  of  the  intervenors,  an\n          \"amateur  genealogist,\" that she  had no knowledge\n          of any issue of either Betsey I or Edmund II; \n\n          (3) testimony by a genealogist  for the Government\n          who  had primarily investigated Richard Sr.'s line                                                                         \n          that  he  had not  found  evidence  of any  living\n          descendants of Betsey I or Edmund II.\n\nThe  district  court  reasoned  from this  evidence  to  its\n\nconclusions   in  three   steps,  with   the  help   of  two\n\nMassachusetts cases,  Butrick v.

According  to the district court,\n\nButrick  held  that,  once  the  \"demandants\"  prove  \"their                    \n\nsuccession  to the  title,\" the  burden then  shifts to  the\n\ntenant to prove  the \"existence of  other heirs whose  title\n\nwould defeat or reduce  the claims of the demandants.\"   The\n\ndistrict  court   reasoned,  by   analogy,  that  once   the\n\nintervenors proved  \"their succession\"  to the Betsey  I and\n\nEdmund II interests, the burden  then shifted to the  United\n\nStates  to  show  the  \"existence of  other  heirs,\"  namely\n\ndescendants of those two lines.\n\n                            -14-                                          14\n\n          Second, the district court stated that Loring held                                                                    \n\n(1) that the  presumption of continued life persists  for no\n\nmore than seven  years after a person is last heard from, at\n\nwhich point a  \"presumption of death\"  arises, and (2)  that\n\nthose  claiming  that a  person  presumed  dead left  either\n\nspouse  or  children have  the burden  of  proving it.   The\n\ndistrict  court apparently  reasoned that  since no  one had\n\nheard of any descendant of Betsey I since at least 1895, nor\n\nof any descendant  of Edmund  II since at  least 1931,  that\n\nthese descendants (alive in 1895 and 1931) were \"presumed to\n\nhave died out.\"  The court also concluded that United States\n\nhad not proved the existence of any issue. \n\n          Third, the district court  noted that there \"is no\n\nindication  in the file that any attempt to locate the heirs\n\nof Betsey [I] or Edmund [II] was  made until this action was\n\nfiled [in 1984].\"  For this reason, the court concluded that\n\nthe two lines would be  presumed to have died out as  of the\n\n1984  filing date,  seven years  after Elizabeth's  death in                                                   \n\n1977.\n\n          We  do not  believe that  these cases  warrant the\n\nresult  now before  us.   For  one  thing, Butrick  involved                                                               \n\nplaintiffs  who established their \"succession\" to title with\n\nat least a  little more  evidence than was  present in  this\n\n                            -15-                                          15\n\ncase.    The  demandants  there obtained  title  from  their\n\nancestor, who  had allegedly  obtained title from  relatives\n\n(not the children) of a man  named Jacob Ayer, who had  died\n\nin 1789.  Jacob  Ayer, in turn, inherited his  interest from\n\nhis  father.   To  establish their  claim  to at  least some\n\nownership interest  in the  property, the plaintiffs  had to\n\nshow  that the relatives of Jacob Ayer had had title, which,\n\nin turn, required them  to show that Jacob Ayer  had left no\n\nissue.   Butrick, 155 Mass. at  465.  To establish  the full                             \n\nextent of Jacob Ayer's  interest in the property,  and hence\n\ntheir own, the  plaintiffs had to show that  Jacob's brother\n\nJoseph had died before  Jacob died, and without issue.   Id.                                                                        \n\nat 466. \n\n          To show the first of these matters, the plaintiffs\n\nprovided,  as a  witness,  Mrs. Butrick,  Jacob Ayer's  step\n\ngreat-granddaughter,   whom  the   court  held   (given  her\n\nrelationship  and interests)  competent  to  testify \"as  to\n\ngeneral repute . . . as to  matters of pedigree.\"  Id.  Mrs.                                                                  \n\nButrick  testified  that  Jacob's  second marriage  (to  her\n\ngreat-grandmother) produced no issue  and that she had never\n\nheard of any issue from Jacob's first marriage.  Id. at 465-                                                                \n\n66.  To  show the  second of these  matters, the  plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted  (1)  the  will  of  Jacob  Ayer's  father,  which\n\n                            -16-                                          16\n\nmentioned six children, including Jacob, but not his brother\n\nJoseph, and (2) \"evidence  of the unsuccessful inquiry where\n\nit was  probable that information  could be found  if Joseph\n\nhad  been living  up to 1810,\"  including an  examination of\n\nheadstones and  official records  in the  town where  he was\n\nborn.  Id. at 466-67.                         \n\n          The  evidence as  to  the first  of these  matters\n\n(Jacob's  lack of issue)  seems at  least a  little stronger\n\nthan the  comparable evidence here.  One can more reasonably\n\nbe expected to  know (as  in Butrick)  whether one's  (step)                                                 \n\ngreat-grandfather  had  children  than  to  know  (as  here)\n\nwhether one  has third cousins  who are still  living, i.e.,\n\nwhether one's great-grandfather had brothers or  sisters who\n\nhad children who had  children who had children who  are now\n\nalive.  The evidence  of the second of these  matters (i.e.,\n\nthe extinction of a  collateral line with a rival  claim) is\n\nmuch  stronger  in  Butrick  than here,  for  it  included a                                        \n\nserious search,  the failure of which  had obvious probative\n\nvalue.   The record in  this case, by  contrast, contains no\n\nevidence  of any significant effort to locate, or to provide\n\nnotice to,  the descendants of  Betsey I or  Edmund II.   Of\n\ncourse,  the Massachusetts  courts decided Butrick  nearly a                                                               \n\ncentury ago.  But in light of the technological improvements\n\n                            -17-                                          17\n\nwhich have made it  easier to track down  other individuals,\n\nwe believe Massachusetts courts  would insist, if  anything,\n\non  greater efforts  to locate  missing owners,  rather than                        \n\nneedlessly tolerate lesser efforts.                                         \n\n          We are also uncertain  about whether, or just how,\n\nLoring applies  here,  say, to  Edmund  II's  grandchildren.                   \n\nLoring involved a man who departed from where he lived, went                   \n\noff to sea, and who  was never heard of again by  his family\n\nand those  in his  native town.   Loring,  42 Mass.  at 206.                                                     \n\nEdmund II's grandchildren do not seem quite like the missing\n\nsailor,  however, for  there is  no  reason to  believe that\n\nthose with whom they lived never \"heard of\" them after 1931.\n\nSee Knapp v.

The  only reason we  have not                                                               \n\nheard  of them again, as far as  the record reveals, is that\n\nno one has attempted to look for them.   \n\n          Regardless, we  do not see how  Loring (whether or                                                             \n\nnot taken together with  Butrick) could justify the district                                             \n\ncourt's conclusion that  the two lines died  out after 1977.                                                                        \n\nIf we accept, for the sake of argument, that Loring's \"seven                                                                \n\nyear\"  presumption applies,  then we  would have  to presume\n\n                            -18-                                          18\n\nthat Betsey  I's grandchildren  were no longer  living seven\n\nyears  after  1895, when,  according  to  the record,  their\n\nexistence was last documented.   Similarly, we would have to\n\npresume that Edmund II's  grandchildren were no longer alive\n\nseven  years  after 1931.   Were  that  so (and  assuming no\n\nissue), the  intervenors would  not inherit the  lost heirs'\n\nentire interests, because others (including Richard Jr., the\n\nfather of Elizabeth, the Government's grantor) were alive in\n\n1902 and/or 1938, and thus entitled  to a share.  The record\n\nis  totally silent  as to  whether Betsey  I or  Edmund II's\n\ngrandchildren  produced issue.   And,  we do  not understand\n\nwhat rule of law would permit the court to presume both that                                                                    \n\nthese grandchildren  (and  any issue  they  produced)  still\n\nexisted in 1977  and that they died  (without issue) shortly                                 \n\nafter 1977.\n\n          For  these reasons, we conclude that Massachusetts\n\nlaw, as it applies  to the facts before us, does not support\n\nthe district court's award  of 50% of the locus  (consisting\n\nof  Betsey I's 25% interest and Edmund II's 25% interest) to\n\nthe  intervenors.   We  therefore must  vacate the  judgment\n\nbelow  insofar as it makes that  award.  We need not further\n\ndecide precisely how Massachusetts law ought to apply to the\n\n                            -19-                                          19\n\nexisting record because,  for reasons  set out  in Part  III\n\nbelow, the relevant facts may change. \n\n                            -20-                                          20\n\n                            III.\n\n                    Further Proceedings                                                    \n\n          As noted above, the United States has filed, while\n\nthis appeal was  pending before this  court, a complaint  in\n\ncondemnation against the  eight acres at issue  here.  After\n\noral  argument on  appeal,  the United  States  asked us  to\n\nvacate the judgment below so that the district court, in the\n\ncondemnation  action,  can  determine compensable  ownership\n\ninterests on  a clean slate.   We see no basis  for vacating\n\nthe judgment below, however,  insofar as that decision makes\n\na final award of interests.  The judgment below is obviously                    \n\n\"final\"  with respect to Richard Sr.'s 25% share, for no one\n\nhas appealed  from that  award. See Restatement  (Second) of                                                                         \n\nJudgments,    13 cmt. e (\"A  judgment may be final  in a res                      \n\njudicata  sense  as to  a  part of  an action  [or  a claim]\n\nalthough the litigation continues  as to the rest\").   It is\n\nalso  \"final\"  with  respect  to Charles'  25%  share,  for,\n\nalthough the  United States has appealed that award, we have\n\nfound no legal reason  to disturb it. See id. at   13 cmt. f                                                         \n\n(\"a judgment  otherwise final remains so  despite the taking\n\nof  an appeal . . . .   finality [not being] affected by the\n\nfact  that  the taking  of  the appeal  [may]  prevent[] its\n\nexecution  or enforcement\").

Here,  it  seems both  fair and\n\npotentially  expeditious  for  the  district  court's \"quiet\n\ntitle\"   allocation  of  Charles's   share  to   govern  the\n\ncondemnation action's compensation  decisions (as they  will\n\nin the  case  of  Richard Sr.'s  share).  See id.  at     27                                                             \n\n(setting forth the basic principle of collateral estoppel).\n\n          Since we  vacate the judgment below  in respect to\n\nthe rest  of the  \"quiet title\" action,  which concerns  the\n\ndistribution  of the Betsey I and Edmund II shares, there is\n\nno  final judgment  in effect regarding  those shares.   And                               \n\nbecause  we  find  that  condemnation  will  eliminate   the\n\nrequisite controversy as to who owns the Betsey I and Edmund\n\nII shares,  we  order  the district  court  to  dismiss  the\n\ncomplaint in respect to the vacated portions as \"moot.\"  The\n\ndistrict court  should determine  afresh whom  to compensate\n\nfor those shares in the context of the separate condemnation\n\naction.   Because  we have  found  authority from  a  sister\n\ncircuit  that  casts  doubt  upon  our  finding  of  partial\n\nmootness, and because  the plaintiff and  intervenors oppose\n\nvacatur, we shall explain our reasoning in some detail.\n\n                            -22-                                          22\n\n          At the outset,  one must understand  a few of  the\n\ntechnical differences  between a \"quiet title\"  action and a\n\n\"condemnation\" proceeding.  A condemnation action is brought\n\nby the  Government and proceeds in rem  against the property                                                   \n\nitself.  See United States v.

The  initial inquiry in  any such action\n\nmust therefore be, \"Who holds superior title to the property\n\n-- the plaintiff or the United States?\"  Only if the  courts\n\nfinally resolve  the title dispute  in a manner  \"adverse to\n\nthe  United  States\"  (i.e.,  the  plaintiff  holds superior\n\ntitle) will they reach a  second question, \"Does the  United\n\nStates  wish to  keep  the  plaintiff's  property  interest,\n\nregardless,  by paying just compensation for it?\"   Once the\n\nproperty  has been  condemned,  however,  the \"quiet  title\"\n\ncourt cannot make  a \"final determination\" as  to title that\n\nis \"adverse  to the United States.\"   The condemnation gives\n\nthe  United States  indefeasible title.   Hence,  the \"quiet\n\ntitle\" action's first question  -- \"Who has superior title?\"\n\n-- is preclusively determined in the United States' favor. \n\n          The upshot is that  the filing of the condemnation\n\naction has  eliminated the prerequisite for  a \"quiet title\"\n\naction -- a  \"disputed title\"  -- and  thereby \"mooted\"  its\n\nthreshold inquiry, \"Who  owns title?\"  For this  reason, the\n\nunresolved  portion  of  this  \"quiet  title\"  action cannot\n\ncontinue.\n\n                            -26-                                          26\n\n          Strong   practical   considerations  support   our\n\ntechnical reading.  A condemnation action seems to provide a\n\nmore effective  way than a  \"quiet title\" action  to deliver\n\njust  compensation  to  those private  persons  entitled  to\n\nreceive it.   \"Quiet title\" procedures  do not automatically\n\nprovide for  the notification of  persons not  party to  the\n\naction (e.g., the  \"lost\" descendants of Betsey I and Edmund\n\nII) who may have  title superior to both plaintiffs  and the\n\nGovernment.     Thus,  the  true  owners   may  not  receive\n\ncompensation, and  a court,  wrongly believing that  they do\n\nnot  exist, may order  the Government to  pay the plaintiffs                \n\nfull compensation, thereby exposing the Government to double\n\nliability should the true owners eventually surface and sue.\n\n          The  procedures  for  condemnation,  by  contrast,\n\nexpressly require the Government to take steps to search for\n\n\"lost\" heirs.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2) (\"prior to any                               \n\nhearing involving the compensation to be paid for a piece of\n\n[condemned]   property,   the  [condemnor]   shall   add  as\n\ndefendants  all  persons having  . .  .  an interest  in the\n\nproperty  whose names  can  be ascertained  by a  reasonably\n\ndiligent search of the records,  . . . and also  those whose\n\nnames have  otherwise been learned.\").

In Fulcher, a                                                                      \n\nplaintiff  brought a   2409a action in 1977 to \"quiet title\"\n\nto  property  which  the Government  had  condemned eighteen\n\n                            -29-                                          29\n\nyears earlier, in 1959,  without properly notifying him.   A\n\nmajority of the  Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc,  held that\n\nthe  1959  condemnation  vested indefeasible  title  in  the\n\nGovernment.  Fulcher,  632 F.2d at  284 (plurality); id.  at                                                                    \n\n294 (Hall, concurring in part  and dissenting in party); id.                                                                        \n\nat 295  (Murnaghan, dissenting).   Yet a majority  also held\n\nthat  the plaintiff  could  nonetheless maintain  a    2409a\n\n\"quiet title\"  action in  order to obtain  just compensation\n\nfor the  Government's appropriation of his  property. Id. at                                                                     \n\n285  (plurality); id.  at 286  (Phillips, concurring).   The                                 \n\nCircuit reached this result  even though the plaintiff could\n\nhave sought compensation  in the Court of  Claims (now known\n\nas  the United  States Claims Court)  by bringing  a takings\n\nclaim  under the Tucker Act.  28 U.S.C.    1491 (\"The United\n\nStates Claims  Courts  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  render\n\njudgment upon any  claim against the United States founded .\n\n.  . upon the Constitution\").  See  Fulcher, 632 F.2d at 295                                                        \n\n(Murnaghan dissenting) (arguing that Court of Claims was the\n\nappropriate  forum  for   plaintiff's  claim).     Fulcher's                                                                       \n\nholding,  applied to  the  present case,  suggests that  the\n\nGovernment's condemnation  of the eight acres  at issue here\n\ndoes not  \"moot\" the  intervenors'  remaining \"quiet  title\"\n\nclaims,   or   prevent   the   parties   from   adjudicating\n\n                            -30-                                          30\n\ncompensation  in the  context of  the \"quiet  title\" action.\n\nOne might  well ask,  if Fulcher's plaintiff  could bring  a                                             \n\npost-condemnation   \"quiet   title\"   action  seeking   only                 \n\ncompensation, how  can we  say that the  condemnation action\n\n\"moots\"  further  (compensation-seeking) proceedings  in the\n\n\"quiet title\" action before us?\n\n          We  could  answer  that  question  by  pointing to\n\ndifferences  between this  case  and Fulcher.   The  Fulcher                                                                         \n\nplurality,  for example,  focused  primarily  on  whether  a\n\nplaintiff could sue for compensation in a highly convenient,\n\nlocal  \"quiet title\" forum,  or would, instead,  have to sue\n\nfor  compensation  (under  the   Tucker  Act)  in  the  less\n\nconvenient  Court of Claims.  Fulcher, 632 F.2d at 282, 285-                                                  \n\n86  (plurality).   Here,  by  contrast,  the plaintiffs  can\n\nobtain compensation in the local district court even without\n\nthe  Quiet  Title  Act, and  other  practical considerations\n\nargue strongly in favor of  ending the \"quiet title\"  action\n\nand proceeding henceforth in condemnation.\n\n          The Fulcher plurality also developed a theory that                                  \n\nthe   plaintiff  (not  properly   notified  in  the  earlier\n\ncondemnation  action)   had  a  kind   of  \"equitable  lien\"\n\nenforceable  in a later \"quiet title\" action.  Id. at 284-85                                                              \n\n(plurality).   That theory  is not  applicable here,  as the\n\n                            -31-                                          31\n\nnamed  plaintiffs   have  all   been   notified  about   the\n\ncondemnation complaint.\n\n          Rather  than distinguish  Fulcher on  grounds that                                                        \n\nmay further complicate this complex area of law, however, we\n\nbelieve it more straightforward to say that we disagree with\n\nits reasoning.  At bottom, the Fulcher plurality interpreted                                                   \n\nthe \"quiet title\" statute as allowing the  post-condemnation\n\nsuit because  (1) of  policy  grounds favoring  adjudicating\n\nproperty-related  disputes  in  nearby courts,  and  (2) its\n\ninability   to  find   strong   reasons   against  such   an\n\ninterpretation.    Indeed,  it wrote  that  it  \"perceive[d]\n\nneither  congressional  intent  nor  principled  reason  for\n\ndistinguishing\"  between  \"takings\" effected  without formal                                                                  \n\ncondemnation  proceedings  (which,  if  made  without proper\n\ncompensation, can give rise to \"quiet title\" actions  by the\n\nuncompensated owners  for payment) and \"takings\" arising out                                                                     \n\nof formal  condemnation proceedings (which, if  made without\n\nproper  compensation,  can  give  rise to  Court  of  Claims\n\nproceedings for payment).  Id. at 284 (plurality).                                          \n\n          We do see a crucial distinction,  however, between\n\nbringing  a \"quiet  title\" action  where title  is still  in\n\ndispute  and  bringing  a  \"quiet title\"  action  after  the\n\nGovernment   has   indisputably   obtained   title   through\n\n                            -32-                                          32\n\ncondemnation.  This  distinction, as we  have said, lies  in\n\nthe  theory  of  the \"quiet  title\"  suit  as  an action  to\n\nadjudicate  disputed  title,  and  in the  language  of  the\n\nfederal  \"quiet  title\"  statute  itself.      That  statute\n\nprovides that  the Government  may retain real  property (by\n\npaying  just compensation) only  \"if the final determination                                                                         \n\n[of the underlying 'quiet title' action] shall be adverse to                                                                      \n\nthe  United States . .  . .\" 28  U.S.C.   2409a(b) (emphasis\n\nadded).   Where the United States  has indisputably obtained\n\ntitle,  it is difficult to  see how this  condition could be\n\nfulfilled.  So even though, as the Fulcher plurality stated,                                                       \n\nthe  legislative   history  of  the  Quiet   Title  Act  \"is\n\ninconclusive about  claims of omitted owners  arising out of\n\nformal condemnation  proceedings,\" Fulcher, 632  F.2d at 284                                                       \n\n(plurality), the language of the statute, and its underlying\n\nlogic, are not. \n\n          A   second   consideration   that  threatens   our\n\nconclusion  of   \"mootness\"  lies  in  the   fact  that  the\n\nGovernment has not  yet paid  an amount deemed  to be  \"just\n\ncompensation\"  into court.   As  the  case law  makes clear,\n\ntitle shifts upon payment  of this amount, not before.   See                                                                         \n\nAlbert Hanson Lumber Co.,  261 U.S. at 587; 341.45  Acres of                                                                         \n\nLand, 751  F.2d at  926 n.2.

We surmise  that it  has  held up  actual payment\n\npending our  decision in  this appeal.   We  shall therefore\n\neliminate this \"chicken and egg\" problem by conditioning our\n\njudgment, insofar  as it  orders the remanded  \"quiet title\"\n\naction to be dismissed, upon the Government's payment of the\n\ncondemnation award into the district court.\n\n                            IV.\n\n                        The Judgment                                                 \n\n          1.
