Marcelina Soto-Cedeño (Soto) appeals from a\n\ndistrict court judgment upholding an administrative law judge (ALJ)\n\ndecision that denied her application for Social Security disability\n\nbenefits.     We vacate the judgment in part and direct the district\n\ncourt to remand to the ALJ for reconsideration of one issue.\n\n             I.   Background\n\n             Soto     applied    for        disability    benefits,    alleging      a\n\ndisability onset date of May 19, 2001.                  She premised her claim of\n\ndisability on several conditions, including high blood pressure,\n\nkidney disease, depression, and hand, back and hip pain.                    Her last\n\ninsured date was December 31, 2006.\n\n             On December 15, 2005, a disability hearing was held, at\n\nwhich Soto and a vocational expert (VE) testified.                    In a decision\n\ndated March 7, 2006, the ALJ denied disability benefits at step 5\n\nof    the   sequential      evaluation       process.      Relying    on    the   VE's\n\ntestimony, he concluded that, despite her limitations, Soto could\n\nperform       three         unskilled        sedentary       jobs--parking         lot\n\nattendant/cashier, fantasy jewelry production line worker, and\n\noffice photocopy worker.               The Appeals Council denied review,\n\nrendering the ALJ's decision the final agency decision.\n\n             Soto then sought judicial review.              On January 23, 2009,\n\nthe   district      court    issued     a    judgment    affirming    the   agency's\n\ndecision.     Soto appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f              On appeal, our review \"is limited to determining whether\n\nthe ALJ deployed the proper legal standards and found facts upon\n\nthe proper quantum of evidence.\"           Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35\n\n(1st   Cir.    1991)    (per   curiam)    (citation      omitted).        An   \"ALJ's\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive when supported by substantial\n\nevidence, . . . but are not conclusive when derived by ignoring\n\nevidence, misapplying the law, or judging matters entrusted to\n\nexperts.\"      Id. (citations omitted).\n\n              Soto   raises    two    appellate   claims,      one   of   which      is\n\nmeritorious.\n\n              II.    Discussion\n\n              A.    Treating Source Opinion\n\n              The    ALJ   rejected     the    opinion    of    Soto's     treating\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Hector Rivera, that her depression had imposed\n\nmarked or extreme limitations on her ability to perform the mental\n\ndemands of work.        Instead, he essentially accepted the assessments\n\nby consulting examining psychiatrists that her depression had\n\nimposed only mild or moderate limitations on her.                          The VE's\n\ntestimony indicated that if Soto had the marked limitations Dr.\n\nRivera perceived, she would have \"difficulty\" performing the jobs\n\nhe had identified on a sustained basis.\n\n              Soto contends that the ALJ did not give good reasons for\n\nrejecting      Dr.     Rivera's      medical   opinion,     citing    20       CFR   §\n\n404.1527(d)(2).        That regulation states that the agency will give\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftreating    source   opinions    \"on    the    nature   and    severity\"     of   a\n\nclaimant's impairment \"controlling weight\" if they are \"well-\n\nsupported    by    medically     acceptable      clinical      and     laboratory\n\ndiagnostic    techniques\"      and    \"not    inconsistent     with    the   other\n\nsubstantial evidence\" in the case.              It also provides that the\n\nagency will \"always give good reasons\" for the weight it gives a\n\ntreating source opinion.        Id.\n\n            The ALJ rejected Dr. Rivera's opinion in part because no\n\nsupporting treatment notes were attached to his November 20, 2004\n\nreport and RFC assessment.            He also thought that Dr. Rivera's\n\nopinion as of December 2, 2005 was inconsistent with \"the remaining\n\nmedical record\" and with statements by Soto.\n\n            We agree with Soto that the absence of treatment notes\n\ndoes not justify the rejection of Dr. Rivera's opinion.                        Dr.\n\nRivera's November 20, 2004 report explained the basis for his\n\nopinion.    In particular, the doctor described his observations of\n\nSoto and the results of specific memory tests he had administered\n\nto her at her most recent appointment on October 26, 2004.                He used\n\nthe tests that were recommended on the agency report form he filled\n\nout, and the consulting psychiatrists, whose opinions the ALJ\n\ncredited,    had   used   similar     tests,    relying   as    well    on   their\n\nobservations of Soto.\n\n            Accordingly, the absence of treatment notes alone did not\n\nshow that Dr. Rivera's opinion was not \"well-supported by medically\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\facceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques\" (if that\n\nis what the ALJ meant to suggest).           In any event, the parties agree\n\nthat medical sources are not required to attach their treatment\n\nnotes to their reports to the agency.                 And an agency regulation\n\nindicates    that    if   the   ALJ   deemed    Dr.    Rivera's    report   to   be\n\n\"inadequate,\" he should obtain additional information \"first\" by\n\nrecontacting Dr. Rivera.         20 CFR § 404.1512(e)(1).\n\n             Nor do we think that Dr. Rivera's medical opinion as of\n\nDecember 2, 2005 can reasonably be characterized as \"inconsistent\"\n\nwith   the   other   medical     evidence      of   record.       The   consulting\n\npsychiatrists and Dr. Rivera evaluated Soto's condition as of\n\ndifferent time periods.         One consultant examined Soto on March 20,\n\n2003, the other on November 18, 2003, and their opinions obviously\n\nrelated to her functioning at that time. In contrast, Dr. Rivera's\n\nNovember 20, 2004 RFC assessment indicated that it was a \"current\n\nevaluation,\" and referred to his accompanying report, which had\n\nrecorded his observations and testing of Soto on October 26, 2004.\n\nIn that report, Dr. Rivera also noted that Soto's condition had\n\ndeteriorated progressively.           In his December 2, 2005 report, Dr.\n\nRivera   used    present    tense     verb     forms    in    describing    Soto's\n\nlimitations and again noted her \"sustained deterioration.\"                  There\n\nis no conflicting medical evidence or opinion in the record for the\n\ntime period encompassed by Dr. Rivera's reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          To sum the above up, while the consulting psychiatrists'\n\nreports may well be substantial evidence that supports the ALJ's\n\ndetermination that Soto was not disabled in 2003, they do not\n\nconflict with, or undermine, Dr. Rivera's opinion relative to later\n\ntime periods.\n\n          We    also   find   no   inconsistency     between   Dr.    Rivera's\n\nassessment and statements by Soto.               Contrary to what the ALJ\n\napparently concluded, Soto reported only that her family doctor and\n\nnephrologist had advised her against taking prescription pain\n\nmedications because they could worsen her kidney condition.                 She\n\ndid not say that Dr. Rivera or her other doctors had advised her\n\nnot to take her prescription psychiatric medications.                 And, on\n\nDecember 10, 2003, Soto told a consulting examining physician that\n\nshe got \"poor relief\" from her psychiatric medications, which is\n\nconsistent with Dr. Rivera's report that she had not responded to\n\ntreatment with drugs.\n\n          Soto's   description      of     her   daily   activities   did   not\n\nundermine Dr. Rivera's assessment either.            Just as in March 2003,\n\nSoto stated at the hearing in December 2005 that she watched TV.\n\nHer ability to watch TV does not show her ability to perform the\n\nmental tasks necessary for work.            Moreover, Soto's statement in\n\nMarch 2003 that her husband would not let her cook because she left\n\nthe stove on is consistent with Dr. Rivera's comments on her memory\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdeficits, inattentiveness, and inability to concentrate on tasks at\n\nhand due to her depression.\n\n           Soto's remaining statements from March 2003 were outdated\n\nby the time the ALJ rendered his decision.            On November 18, 2003,\n\nSoto had told a consulting examining psychologist that she did not\n\nhelp with household duties, engage in social activities, or visit\n\nwith others, and Dr. Rivera gave similar reports for subsequent\n\nyears. He said that Soto's pain kept her from performing household\n\ntasks, that she got confused and could not develop a work plan, and\n\nthat she rejected visitors and conversations.\n\n           In short, the ALJ did not give supportable reasons for\n\nrejecting Dr. Rivera's opinion as to Soto's ability to function in\n\nthe workplace for the time frame the doctor had evaluated.                  We\n\ntherefore vacate the district court's judgment insofar as it upheld\n\nthis portion of the ALJ's decision, and we direct the court to\n\nremand to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with our\n\nopinion.   See Johnson v. Astrue, 597 F.3d 409, 411 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(per curiam) (remanding under similar circumstances).\n\n           B.    Physical Impairments\n\n           Soto's second appellate claim is that the ALJ ignored\n\nevidence about her various physical limitations and substituted his\n\njudgment for that of medical professionals.           After careful review\n\nof the record and the ALJ's decision, however, we conclude that the\n\nsubstantial     evidence   of   record    supported    most   of   the   ALJ's\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fconclusions.    We are somewhat troubled by the ALJ's treatment of\n\nSoto's left-wrist condition and her claims of hand pain.                But the\n\nonly argument that Soto presents on that score is unpersuasive.\n\n            Soto argues that, due to her hand impairments, she lacks\n\nbilateral    manual   dexterity.      She   seems   to    maintain     that   her\n\nlimitation so eroded the range of unskilled sedentary work she\n\ncould perform that she should have been found to be disabled.                 She\n\ncites Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990 (1st Cir. 1991), a case\n\ninvolving a claimant with a significant limitation in bilateral\n\nmanual dexterity, in which the ALJ had relied on the Grids as a\n\nframework for finding the claimant not to be disabled.               We vacated\n\nthe district court's judgment, directing the court to remand to the\n\nALJ for further proceedings because the ALJ had not consulted a\n\nvocational expert before denying disability benefits.                Id. at 996.\n\n            Here, however, the ALJ did consult a VE, a fact that Soto\n\ndoes not discuss.      Furthermore, the government argues that the\n\nALJ's hypothetical to the VE adequately accounted for Soto's\n\nhand/wrist    condition,   and     that    the   VE's    testimony    therefore\n\nsupported the denial of benefits.         Soto has not filed a reply brief\n\nresponding to that argument.         If there was error in how the ALJ\n\nproceeded, then, she has waived the defect. Poupore v. Astrue, 566\n\nF.3d 303, 306 (2d Cir. 2009) (courts may deem unraised claims of\n\nerror to be waived); Wall v. Astrue, 561 F.3d 1048, 1065 (10th Cir.\n\n2009) (courts may treat inadequately developed claims of error as\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwaived); cf. Mills v. Apfel, 244 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(objections not presented to the ALJ are waived).\n\n           Finally,    we   note   that     Soto   has   given   this   court   a\n\ndisability decision, in which a different ALJ found her to be\n\ndisabled based on her depression and bilateral manual dexterity.\n\nWe   decline   to   consider   that   decision,     which   was   based   on    a\n\ndifferent record and on a much later onset date of disability.\n\n           We vacate the district court's judgment in part and\n\ndirect the court to remand to the ALJ for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.             Otherwise, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Dr.\n\nRivera's November 20, 2004 report explained the basis for his\n\nopinion.    In particular, the doctor described his observations of\n\nSoto and the results of specific memory tests he had administered\n\nto her at her most recent appointment on October 26, 2004.                He used\n\nthe tests that were recommended on the agency report form he filled\n\nout, and the consulting psychiatrists, whose opinions the ALJ\n\ncredited,    had   used   similar     tests,    relying   as    well    on   their\n\nobservations of Soto.\n\n            Accordingly, the absence of treatment notes alone did not\n\nshow that Dr. Rivera's opinion was not \"well-supported by medically\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\facceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques\" (if that\n\nis what the ALJ meant to suggest).           In any event, the parties agree\n\nthat medical sources are not required to attach their treatment\n\nnotes to their reports to the agency.                 And an agency regulation\n\nindicates    that    if   the   ALJ   deemed    Dr.    Rivera's    report   to   be\n\n\"inadequate,\" he should obtain additional information \"first\" by\n\nrecontacting Dr. Rivera.         20 CFR § 404.1512(e)(1).\n\n             Nor do we think that Dr. Rivera's medical opinion as of\n\nDecember 2, 2005 can reasonably be characterized as \"inconsistent\"\n\nwith   the   other   medical     evidence      of   record.       The   consulting\n\npsychiatrists and Dr. Rivera evaluated Soto's condition as of\n\ndifferent time periods.         One consultant examined Soto on March 20,\n\n2003, the other on November 18, 2003, and their opinions obviously\n\nrelated to her functioning at that time. In contrast, Dr. Rivera's\n\nNovember 20, 2004 RFC assessment indicated that it was a \"current\n\nevaluation,\" and referred to his accompanying report, which had\n\nrecorded his observations and testing of Soto on October 26, 2004.\n\nIn that report, Dr. Rivera also noted that Soto's condition had\n\ndeteriorated progressively.           In his December 2, 2005 report, Dr.\n\nRivera   used    present    tense     verb     forms    in    describing    Soto's\n\nlimitations and again noted her \"sustained deterioration.\"                  There\n\nis no conflicting medical evidence or opinion in the record for the\n\ntime period encompassed by Dr. Rivera's reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          To sum the above up, while the consulting psychiatrists'\n\nreports may well be substantial evidence that supports the ALJ's\n\ndetermination that Soto was not disabled in 2003, they do not\n\nconflict with, or undermine, Dr. Rivera's opinion relative to later\n\ntime periods.\n\n          We    also   find   no   inconsistency     between   Dr.    Rivera's\n\nassessment and statements by Soto.               Contrary to what the ALJ\n\napparently concluded, Soto reported only that her family doctor and\n\nnephrologist had advised her against taking prescription pain\n\nmedications because they could worsen her kidney condition.                 She\n\ndid not say that Dr. Rivera or her other doctors had advised her\n\nnot to take her prescription psychiatric medications.                 And, on\n\nDecember 10, 2003, Soto told a consulting examining physician that\n\nshe got \"poor relief\" from her psychiatric medications, which is\n\nconsistent with Dr. Rivera's report that she had not responded to\n\ntreatment with drugs.\n\n          Soto's   description      of     her   daily   activities   did   not\n\nundermine Dr. Rivera's assessment either.            Just as in March 2003,\n\nSoto stated at the hearing in December 2005 that she watched TV.\n\nHer ability to watch TV does not show her ability to perform the\n\nmental tasks necessary for work.            Moreover, Soto's statement in\n\nMarch 2003 that her husband would not let her cook because she left\n\nthe stove on is consistent with Dr. Rivera's comments on her memory\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdeficits, inattentiveness, and inability to concentrate on tasks at\n\nhand due to her depression.\n\n           Soto's remaining statements from March 2003 were outdated\n\nby the time the ALJ rendered his decision.            On November 18, 2003,\n\nSoto had told a consulting examining psychologist that she did not\n\nhelp with household duties, engage in social activities, or visit\n\nwith others, and Dr. Rivera gave similar reports for subsequent\n\nyears. He said that Soto's pain kept her from performing household\n\ntasks, that she got confused and could not develop a work plan, and\n\nthat she rejected visitors and conversations.\n\n           In short, the ALJ did not give supportable reasons for\n\nrejecting Dr. Rivera's opinion as to Soto's ability to function in\n\nthe workplace for the time frame the doctor had evaluated.                  We\n\ntherefore vacate the district court's judgment insofar as it upheld\n\nthis portion of the ALJ's decision, and we direct the court to\n\nremand to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with our\n\nopinion.

Physical Impairments\n\n           Soto's second appellate claim is that the ALJ ignored\n\nevidence about her various physical limitations and substituted his\n\njudgment for that of medical professionals.           After careful review\n\nof the record and the ALJ's decision, however, we conclude that the\n\nsubstantial     evidence   of   record    supported    most   of   the   ALJ's\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fconclusions.    We are somewhat troubled by the ALJ's treatment of\n\nSoto's left-wrist condition and her claims of hand pain.                But the\n\nonly argument that Soto presents on that score is unpersuasive.\n\n            Soto argues that, due to her hand impairments, she lacks\n\nbilateral    manual   dexterity.      She   seems   to    maintain     that   her\n\nlimitation so eroded the range of unskilled sedentary work she\n\ncould perform that she should have been found to be disabled.

We vacated\n\nthe district court's judgment, directing the court to remand to the\n\nALJ for further proceedings because the ALJ had not consulted a\n\nvocational expert before denying disability benefits.                Id. at 996.\n\n            Here, however, the ALJ did consult a VE, a fact that Soto\n\ndoes not discuss.      Furthermore, the government argues that the\n\nALJ's hypothetical to the VE adequately accounted for Soto's\n\nhand/wrist    condition,   and     that    the   VE's    testimony    therefore\n\nsupported the denial of benefits.         Soto has not filed a reply brief\n\nresponding to that argument.         If there was error in how the ALJ\n\nproceeded, then, she has waived the defect. Poupore v.
