Pereira,\n                                                              \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Appellant  Morgan  Rivera-Perez pled\n                     \n\nguilty to one count  of mail fraud, and aiding  and abetting,\n\nin violation of  18 U.S.C.    2, 1341.   Prior to sentencing,\n\nthe government filed a motion requesting a downward departure\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  The district court declined to\n\ndepart downward and sentenced appellant to twenty-four months\n\nimprisonment,  the  top  end  of  the  applicable  guidelines\n\nsentencing range.1  This appeal ensued.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     On  July 22, 1992, appellant  was the subject  of a four\n\ncount  indictment charging him, and three co-defendants, with\n\nengaging in a scheme to  defraud $1,401,000 from an insurance\n\ncorporation.  On  October 8, 1992,  appellant pled guilty  to\n\nCount  II of the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement with\n\nthe  government.    The  plea  agreement  provided  that  the\n\nrelevant  conduct for purposes  of calculating the guidelines\n\nsentencing  range would be limited  to the amount  of loss to\n\nwhich  the  defendant   pled  guilty  ($322,000.00).2     The\n\nagreement  further provided  that  the  government  would  be\n\nwilling to consider future  truthful cooperation by appellant\n\n                    \n\n1.  The district court also imposed a supervised release term\nof  three years, restitution in the amount of $275,000, and a\nspecial monetary assessment of $50.00.\n\n2.  The  limitation in  relevant  conduct resulted  in a  net\ntotal  offense level  under  the guidelines  which was  three\nlevels below what it otherwise would have been.  \n\n                             -2-\n\nin  determining  whether to  move  the district  court  for a\n\ndownward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.\n\n     On  August  5,  1993,  appellant  appeared  before   the\n\ndistrict court for the imposition of sentence.  At that time,\n\nthe government filed a motion requesting a downward departure\n\npursuant  to   5K1.1.  In its motion, the government detailed\n\nnot only the assistance  provided by appellant in prosecuting\n\nthe particular scheme for which he was indicted, but also his\n\nassistance in  investigating  other offenses.   The  district\n\ncourt  declined  to  depart  downward.   In  support  of  its\n\ndecision, the district court stated:\n\n     Granting  the   value  of   his  past  and   future\n     cooperation,  it is  generally recognized  that the\n     Court need not reward defendant for his cooperation\n     if such defendant has already received the  benefit\n     of that cooperation through a plea agreement.  Such\n     was  the case  here where defendant  Rivera charged\n     with  serious fraudulent  conduct obtained  a three\n     level reduction  of his offense level upon agreeing\n     in the  plea agreement that the  base offense level\n     be  calculated on  the basis  of the  three hundred\n     twenty-two thousand dollars which he  received, and\n     not on the  basis of  the total lose  [sic] to  the\n     victim of one million four hundred and one thousand\n     as  a  result  of the  scheme  of  which  he was  a\n     principal  participant in  a  criminal  venture  of\n     considerable magnitude.   To depart  downward given\n     the circumstances of this  case would serve only to\n     trivialize  defendant's  criminal  wrongdoing,  and\n     would defeat  the deterant [sic] effect  a sentence\n     would   have   on   others.      Accordingly,   the\n     government's  motion  for  downward   departure  is\n     denied.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     An appeal will  not lie from a district  court's refusal\n\nto depart from a  properly calculated sentencing range unless\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe  failure to  depart stemmed  from the  sentencing court's\n\nmistaken  impression that  it lacked  the legal  authority to\n\ndepart or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the\n\nrules  governing  departure.   See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMcAndrews,  12 F.3d  273,  276 n.2  (1st  Cir. 1993);  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n113 S. Ct. 224 (1992).  Appellant attempts to fit within  the\n\nexception  by  arguing that  the  district  court's departure\n\ndecision reflected a misunderstanding  of the guidelines.  We\n\ndisagree.\n\n     In  United States v.  Mariano, 983 F.2d  1150, 1157 (1st\n                                  \n\nCir. 1993), we  stated that  a district court  may decide  to\n\nforgo  a      5K1.1  downward  departure  on   the  basis  of\n\nconsiderations \"not constitutionally  proscribed.\"   Contrary\n\nto  the  position  urged  by  appellant,  there  was  nothing\n\nimproper in  the district court declining  to depart downward\n\nfrom the applicable guideline sentencing range on the grounds\n\nthat   a  lesser   sentence   would  trivialize   appellant's\n\nwrongdoing and fail to have a deterrent effect.  Indeed, such\n\nconsiderations are perfectly consistent  with the purposes of\n\nthe  sentencing  system  which  include  \"the  need  for  the\n\nsentence imposed `to  promote respect for  the law,' and  `to\n\nafford adequate  deterrence  to criminal  conduct.'\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Smith, 14 F.3d  662, 666 (1st  Cir. 1994) (quoting\n                \n\nfrom 18 U.S.C.   3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B)).     \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Appellant's  remaining  argument   boils  down  to   the\n\ncontention  that the district court erred in thinking that he\n\nsought  a  double  benefit--the  three  level  reduction   in\n\nrelevant conduct  which resulted from his  plea agreement and\n\nan  additional     5K1.1  downward  departure--for  the  same\n\ncooperation.   Appellant argues that he did not seek a double\n\nbenefit since the  reduction in relevant conduct was based on\n\nhis initial  assistance  to the  government and  the    5K1.1\n\nmotion was  based on  further assistance rendered.   Assuming\n\nwithout  deciding that  we have  jurisdiction to  review this\n\nclaimed error, we disagree that the district court's comments\n\nat  sentencing  reflected  any fundamental  misunderstanding.\n\nThe district  court duly considered the  value of appellant's\n\n\"past  and future\"  cooperation  with the  government.3   The\n\ncourt concluded, however, that in light of the seriousness of\n\nthe   crime  and  the   substantial  sentencing  benefit  the\n\nappellant  had already  received,  no additional  benefit was\n\nwarranted.    This  decision  was well  within  the  district\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\n     The judgment below is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n3.  Where,  as here,  the district  court declined  to depart\nfrom the applicable guideline  range, it was not required  to\nmake specific findings regarding  such factors as the degree,\nefficacy,  timeliness,  and   circumstances  of   appellant's\ncooperation  with the  government.    Accordingly, we  reject\nappellant's  suggestion that  the  court's failure  to do  so\nindicates that it did not properly consider these factors.\n\n                             -5-\n",

McAndrews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195084\"><a href=\"/opinion/195084/united-states-v-mcandrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 276 n. 2 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Amparo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/581358/united-states-v-luz-maria-amparo-aka-luz-maria-amparo-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span> (1992).  Appellant attempts to fit within the exception by arguing that the district court's departure decision reflected a misunderstanding of the guidelines.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  United States v. Mariano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1157 (1st Cir. 1993), we stated that a district court may decide to forgo a Sec. 5K1.1 downward departure on the basis of considerations \"not constitutionally proscribed.\"  Contrary to the position urged by appellant, there was nothing improper in the district court declining to depart downward from the applicable guideline sentencing range on the grounds that a lesser sentence would trivialize appellant's wrongdoing and fail to have a deterrent effect.  Indeed, such considerations are perfectly consistent with the purposes of the sentencing system which include \"the need for the sentence imposed 'to promote respect for the law,' and 'to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.' \"   United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195168\"><a href=\"/opinion/195168/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 666 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting from 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's remaining argument boils down to the contention that the district court erred in thinking that he sought a double benefit-the three level reduction in relevant conduct which resulted from his plea agreement and an additional Sec. 5K1.1 downward departure-for the same cooperation.  Appellant argues that he did not seek a double benefit since the reduction in relevant conduct was based on his initial assistance to the government and the Sec. 5K1.1 motion was based on further assistance rendered.  Assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction to review this claimed error, we disagree that the district court's comments at sentencing reflected any fundamental misunderstanding.  The district court duly considered the value of appellant's \"past and future\" cooperation with the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court concluded, however, that in light of the seriousness of the crime and the substantial sentencing benefit the appellant had already received, no additional benefit was warranted.  This decision was well within the district court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed.  See 1st Cir.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court also imposed a supervised release term of three years, restitution in the amount of $275,000, and a special monetary assessment of $50.00</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The limitation in relevant conduct resulted in a net total offense level under the guidelines which was three levels below what it otherwise would have been</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Where, as here, the district court declined to depart from the applicable guideline range, it was not required to make specific findings regarding such factors as the degree, efficacy, timeliness, and circumstances of appellant's cooperation with the government.  Accordingly, we reject appellant's suggestion that the court's failure to do so indicates that it did not properly consider these factors</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
