It follows  a district\n\ncourt's  dismissal  of the  third  action  brought by  plaintiff-\n\nappellant  Scott   Martel  in   what  has  been   a  consistently\n\nunsuccessful effort  to  stay in  court  long enough  to  recover\n\ndamages  for  personal   injuries  sustained  in   an  automobile\n\naccident.      Because   the  district   court   lacked  personal\n\njurisdiction  over the sole defendant, a foreign executor sued as\n\nsuch, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Leaving to  one side the seepage  from the geographical\n\nmorass  in  which this  case is  mired,  the prefatory  facts are\n\nstraightforward.   On April 18,  1985, an accident  occurred on a\n\nVermont highway.  Martel,  a Vermont resident, sustained injuries\n\nwhen an automobile in which he was riding collided with a vehicle\n\ndriven  by Wilhelmina S. Parker.   Parker, a  citizen of Maryland\n\nwho was  in the process  of moving  into a new  home in  Vermont,\n\nperished two days  later as an aftermath of the  crash.  She died\n\ntestate,  owning property  located  exclusively in  Maryland  and\n\nVermont.    Pursuant   to  her  will,  probate   courts  in  both\n\njurisdictions  appointed  George  F.  Stafford,  a  Massachusetts\n\nresident, as executor.   Letters of administration were issued to\n\nStafford  in Maryland on  May 22,  1985 and  letters testamentary\n\nwere issued to him in Vermont on August 19, 1985.\n\n          Martel seemed to  be in no  particular hurry to  assert\n\nhis rights.   It was  not until  April 18, 1988  that he  brought\n\n                                3\n\nidentical  suits against Stafford in a Vermont state court and in\n\nVermont's  federal district  court.   In due  course, each  court\n\ndismissed Martel's  complaint as  time-barred on the  ground that\n\nthe  applicable statute of  limitations pretermitted  the action.\n\nSee  Vt.  Stat. Ann.  tit. 12,     557(a) (1973)  (providing that\n   \n\nactions against an executor  for acts of the decedent  are barred\n\nif  not commenced  within two  years of  the issuance  of letters\n\ntestamentary).\n\n          Undeterred,  appellant  went  in  search  of  a  longer\n\nstatute  of limitations.1    On November  22,  1988, he  filed  a\n\ndiversity  action in  the United  States District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.  Over two years later,  Stafford moved\n\nfor  summary judgment  on a  bouillabaisse of  grounds, including\n\nstatute  of   limitations,  res  judicata,  absence  of  personal\n\njurisdiction,  and  forum non  conveniens.    The district  court\n\ngranted the motion  on the basis of res judicata,  but offered no\n\nelaboration.  This appeal ensued.2\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          While the  district court  invoked the doctrine  of res\n\njudicata,  we  are  free to  affirm  the  judgment  below on  any\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant  also  appealed  the superior  court's  entry  of\njudgment, but to no avail.  See Martel v. Stafford, 603 A.2d 345,\n                                                  \n346 (Vt. 1991) (affirming dismissal of Vermont action).\n\n     2During the  pendency of the proceedings,  Stafford died and\nMarilyn S.  Elias, the executrix  of Stafford's estate,  became a\nparty-defendant  in this action.   See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 25(a)(1);\n                                      \nFed. R. App. P. 43(a).   Because Elias's arrival on the scene has\nno  bearing  on  the disposition  of  this  appeal,  we refer  to\nStafford as if he were still alive and still the sole defendant.\n\n                                4\n\nindependently  sufficient ground  made manifest  by the  record.3\n\nSee Garside  v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990);\n                               \n\nPolyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1987);  Chongris v. Board  of Appeals, 811  F.2d 36, 37  n.1\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1021 (1987).  When, as now, a\n                         \n\npotential jurisdictional defect rears its ugly head, an appellate\n\ncourt  should  not  hesitate  to scrutinize  that  defect  before\n\nproceeding further.  See Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  34,  40  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (stating  that  \"courts  should\n\nordinarily  satisfy jurisdictional concerns before addressing the\n\nmerits of a  civil action\").   Because jurisdiction  is the  most\n\nnatural and obvious starting point here, and because the district\n\ncourt's rationale strikes us as problematic   the general rule is\n\nthat  a dismissal on limitations  grounds does not  bar the claim\n\ngenerally, but only bars a second action in the same jurisdiction\n\nor  in  a  jurisdiction that  would  apply  the  same statute  of\n\nlimitations,  see, e.g.,  18 Charles  A.  Wright et  al., Federal\n                                                                 \n\nPractice &amp;  Procedure    4441,  at 366  (1981)    we  tackle  the\n                     \n\njurisdictional issue first.\n\n           A.  Personal Jurisdiction over an Executor.\n                                                     \n\n          Plaintiff sued only one defendant   Stafford   and sued\n\n                    \n\n     3This option has particular  utility in the summary judgment\ncontext, as a district court's entry  of summary judgment entails\nplenary appellate review.   See, e.g., Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-\n                                                                 \nAlicea,  959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir. 1992); Garside v. Osco Drug,\n                                                                 \nInc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).\n    \n\n                                5\n\nhim  solely  in his  capacity  as executor  of  Parker's estate.4\n\nWith exceptions not pertinent here,  the Civil Rules provide that\n\nthe law  of the forum  state determines a  representative party's\n\ncapacity to sue or be sued in a federal district court.  See Fed.\n                                                            \n\nR. Civ. P. 17(b); see  also 6A Charles A. Wright et  al., Federal\n                                                                 \n\nPractice  &amp; Procedure     1565, at  473  (2d  ed. 1990).    Thus,\n                     \n\nMassachusetts  law  governs  the  determination  of  whether  the\n\ndistrict court could lawfully exercise personal jurisdiction over\n\nStafford qua executor.\n            \n\n          The  traditional  Massachusetts rule  has been  that an\n\nexecutor or administrator  appointed in another state    we shall\n\nuse the generic term \"foreign executor\"   is not subject to  suit\n\nin Massachusetts unless a statute dictates to the contrary.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Saporita v. Litner,  371 Mass. 607, 614 (1976);  Old Colony\n                                                                 \n\nTrust Co. v.  Clarke, 291 Mass. 17, 23 (1935);  Brown v. Boston &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nMe. R.R.,  283 Mass. 192, 195  (1933); Borden v. Borden,  5 Mass.\n                                                       \n\n67, 76-77  (1809); see also  Gallup v. Gallup, 52  Mass. 445, 447\n                                             \n\n(1846)   (holding  that   a  foreign   executor  cannot   sue  in\n\nMassachusetts); Langdon  v.

The  rule  stems from  the  concept that  a  decedent's\n\npersonal  representative  is  a   creature  of  the  state  which\n\nappointed him or  her, and, as  such, possesses  no power to  act\n\nbeyond the creator's boundaries.  See Saporita, 371 Mass. at 615;\n                                              \n\n                    \n\n     4At one point in the proceedings,  plaintiff sought to amend\nhis  complaint to  name Stafford,  individually, as  a defendant.\nThe court below denied the motion.  On appeal, plaintiff does not\nassign error to this ruling.\n\n                                6\n\nBrown,  283 Mass.  at  195;  see  also  Derrick  v.  New  England\n                                                                 \n\nGreyhound  Lines, Inc.,  148 F.  Supp. 496,  497 (D.  Mass. 1957)\n                      \n\n(dismissing action  against foreign  executor on the  ground that\n\n\"even if he were present and served he represents the estate only\n\nto the extent of  his Connecticut appointment, i.e., not  at all,\n\nas [the appointment] has no extraterritorial effect\").\n\n          The traditional rule   like most traditional rules   is\n\nnot without exceptions.   See Saporita, 371 Mass. at  615 (noting\n                                      \n\nthat  \"the  rule has  not  been  rigidly applied\"  and  surveying\n\ncertain common law exceptions).   Saporita illustrates the point.\n                                          \n\nThere,  a  Massachusetts  resident  sued a  foreign  executor  to\n\nrecover  payment for  services  rendered to  the  testator.   The\n\nMassachusetts Supreme  Judicial  Court  (SJC)  approved  a  state\n\ncourt's  exercise  of  personal jurisdiction  over  the executor,\n\nprimarily because  the testator  had a  wealth  of contacts  with\n\nMassachusetts.  See id. at 618.   Although Saporita and this case\n                                                   \n\nshare  a  certain factual  resemblance     in  both instances,  a\n\nforeign state  appointed the executor  according to the  terms of\n\nthe   decedent's   will,   the   foreign   executor   resided  in\n\nMassachusetts and was thus subject  to in-hand service of process\n\nthere, and the decedent  owned no real estate in  Massachusetts  \n\nthe two cases  are more noteworthy  for their dissimilarity  than\n\nfor their similitude.\n\n          In  Saporita,  the   plaintiff  lived  and  worked   in\n                      \n\nMassachusetts.  See id. at  612-13.  The contract upon which  she\n                       \n\nsued had been made and  performed there.  See id.   Moreover, the\n                                                 \n\n                                7\n\ntestator's links  with Massachusetts  were pervasive;  he resided\n\nand practiced medicine  there, considered Boston to  be his home,\n\nand spent approximately seventy-five percent of each week  in the\n\nCommonwealth.   See id. at 611-12.   In the last analysis, it was\n                       \n\nthe testator's contacts with  Massachusetts that prompted the SJC\n\nto relax the traditional rule and find personal jurisdiction over\n\nthe foreign executor.   The court  reasoned that, given  contacts\n\n\"sufficient  .  .  . to  allow  the  court  to exercise  personal\n\njurisdiction over [the testator],\"  substituting an executor who,\n\nalthough appointed  in a foreign jurisdiction,  had himself lived\n\nand  worked  in Massachusetts  and who  had  been served  in hand\n\nthere, would \"not alter the court's jurisdiction.\"  Id. at 618.\n                                                       \n\n          The  case  before  us  is  at  a  considerable  remove.\n\nDespite ample  time for pretrial discovery,  the record discloses\n\nno  relationship between the decedent and the forum state.5  From\n\naught   that   appears,  Parker   had   not  a   single   tie  to\n\n                    \n\n     5It is  apodictic  that  a plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of\nproving facts necessary to establish jurisdiction.  See Donatelli\n                                                                 \nv. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 468 (1st Cir. 1990).  On\n                         \nsuch an issue,  a party faced with a motion  for summary judgment\n\"must  reliably demonstrate  that  specific  facts sufficient  to\ncreate an authentic dispute exist.\"  Garside, 895 F.2d at 48; see\n                                                                 \nalso Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 676-78 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n1992) (discussing  standards for  determining motions to  dismiss\nfor want  of  personal jurisdiction  that  involve the  court  in\nweighing  evidence);   General  Contracting  &amp;  Trading   Co.  v.\n                                                             \nInterpole,  Inc., 899  F.2d  109, 115  (1st  Cir. 1990)  (drawing\n                \nanalogy to Fed.

And, moreover,  the cause of action arose  out of\n\nstate.  Had Parker  survived and Martel attempted  to sue in  the\n\nCommonwealth, there is not the slightest reason to believe that a\n\nMassachusetts court  could  have obtained  jurisdiction over  her\n\nperson.  Here, then, unlike in  Saporita, allowing the suit to go\n                                        \n\nforward based on the foreign executor's presence in Massachusetts\n\nwould significantly alter the jurisdictional calculus.\n\n          We have  said enough.   Because the  Saporita exception\n                                                       \n\nconfers personal  jurisdiction over a foreign  executor only when\n\nthe testator manifests sufficient contacts  with Massachusetts to\n\nsupport the exercise of jurisdiction, not merely when the foreign\n\nexecutor is  within  the  physical  reach of  a  process  server,\n\nParker's  behavioral  patterns  assume   decretory  significance.\n\nBecause she forged no links of any kind with Massachusetts in her\n\nlifetime, her executor's Massachusetts  residency cannot tilt the\n\njurisdictional balance.  And  putting Stafford's residency aside,\n\nappellant has  identified no other state-law  basis for grounding\n\npersonal  jurisdiction.   For our  part, we  can envision  none.6\n\nTherefore,  we  must  apply  the  traditional  rule.    Under it,\n\nStafford,   like  the   stereotypical  foreign  executor,   is  a\n\nnonentity, ergo,  not amenable to  suit beyond the  boundaries of\n\nthe  state(s)  of   his  appointment.     Giving  force  to   the\n\n                    \n\n     6The other exceptions to the traditional rule, see Saporita,\n                                                                \n371 Mass. at  615-17, are  plainly inapposite, as  are two  state\nstatutes  authorizing jurisdiction over  foreign executors upon a\nshowing of sufficient decedent  contacts with Massachusetts.  See\n                                                                 \nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 90,   3A (1990);  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 199A,    9\n(1990).\n\n                                9\n\nMassachusetts  cases and  the policies  behind them,  we conclude\n\nthat  the  district  court   lacked  personal  jurisdiction  over\n\nStafford qua foreign executor.\n            \n\n          We  add a  small  eschatocol.   Absent some  persuasive\n\nindication  that   a  Massachusetts  court   would  abandon   its\n\nlongstanding rule  to find jurisdiction on these specific facts  \n\nan extremely dubious prospect given that  the lawsuit's center of\n\ngravity  obviously lies  elsewhere7    we are  not at  liberty to\n\nmanufacture  a basis for ignoring  the rule.   We have repeatedly\n\nwarned that a plaintiff who, like Martel, selects a federal forum\n\nin  preference to  an available  state forum  may not  expect the\n\nfederal   court   to   steer   state   law   into   unprecedented\n\nconfigurations.  See, e.g., Catrone v. Thoroughbred Racing Ass'ns\n                                                                 \n\nof N.A.,  Inc.,  929 F.2d  881, 889  (1st Cir.  1991); Porter  v.\n                                                             \n\nNutter, 913 F.2d 37,  41 (1st Cir. 1990); Kassel  v. Gannett Co.,\n                                                                \n\n875  F.2d 935, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1989).   While the SJC is free to\n\nreshape  Massachusetts's judge-made  law, we  are not;  rather, a\n\ndiversity court, with  exceptions not germane to  this case, must\n\ntake state law as it stands.\n\n                      B.  Consent (Waiver).\n                                          \n\n          Appellant  argues   that  Stafford  consented   to  the\n\njurisdiction of a Massachusetts  court, or, alternatively, waived\n\n                    \n\n     7We  think  it unlikely  that the  SJC  would fashion  a new\nexception to  an old  and honored  jurisdictional rule  where, as\nhere,  the  plaintiff  is a  non-resident,  the  decedent had  no\ncontacts with Massachusetts, the cause of action arose in another\nplace,  and no discernible state  interest would be  served by an\nassertion of jurisdiction.\n\n                                10\n\nhis jurisdictional defense,8 by  means of statements contained in\n\na  brief  filed  in the  United  States  District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict of  Vermont.    There,  the defendant,  in  response  to\n\nplaintiff's  threat  to bring  an  action  in Maryland's  federal\n\ndistrict   court,   speculated   that,   because   of  Stafford's\n\nMassachusetts  residency,  the proper  fall-back  forum would  be\n\nMassachusetts, not Maryland.\n\n          Appellant's  basic  premise  is  sound:   a  party  may\n\nconsent  to  a  court's   in  personam  jurisdiction  before  the\n                                      \n\ncommencement of an action.  See, e.g., National Equipment Rental,\n                                                                 \n\nLtd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S.  311, 314-15 (1964); Pennsylvania Fire\n                                                                 \n\nIns. Co.  v. Gold  Issue Mining  &amp; Milling Co.,  243 U.S.  93, 95\n                                              \n\n(1917); Holloway v.

But,  consent to personal  jurisdiction cannot\n\nbe said to have  occurred here.  The allegedly  consenting words,\n\nburied, as they were,  in a responsive argument to  a speculative\n\nthreat in a prior suit before a different court  and concerning a\n\nmatter unrelated to that suit's determination, dealt with a topic\n\nwholly separate  from the issue of personal  jurisdiction.  Taken\n\nin  context,  the  language  to which  plaintiff  clings,  quoted\n\n                    \n\n     8Because the alleged conduct occurred beyond the confines of\nthe  present  suit, the  argument may  be  more aptly  phrased as\ninvolving  \"consent\" rather than \"waiver.\"   We do  not probe the\npoint,  however,  for  the  distinction  is  immaterial  in  this\nsituation.  See  General Contracting &amp; Trading Co.  v. Interpole,\n                                                                 \nInc., 940 F.2d 20, 22-23 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir. 1991).\n    \n\n                                11\n\nverbatim in the  margin,9 constituted no  more than an  assertion\n        \n\nthat,  because   an  executor's  residence  controls   for  venue\n\npurposes, see, e.g., Smith v. Harris, 308 F. Supp. 527, 528 (E.D.\n                                    \n\nWis.   1970),   venue   would   likely   lie  in   Massachusetts.\n                     \n\nNotwithstanding appellant's  effort to muddle  the two  concepts,\n\nvenue  and personal  jurisdiction  are not  the  same.   Pre-suit\n\nconsent  to a  court's jurisdiction  must be  far more  clear and\n\nunequivocal than  a passing  remark directed to  another subject.\n\nCf., e.g., National Equipment, 375  U.S. at 314 (equating consent\n                             \n\nwith  agreement  to appoint  an  agent for  service  of process);\n\nPetrowski v.

To the\n\ncontrary, defendant  raised the  jurisdictional objection  in his\n\nanswer and  by motion,  and in  his briefs  below and  on appeal.\n\nThroughout, he made his point abundantly clear.  It  is a winning\n\n                    \n\n     10We think it is well to note that appellant has not claimed\nthat the venue-related allusion  caused any detrimental reliance.\nAt any rate, such a claim would be bootless.   Maryland generally\nviews \"the question as to which period of limitations applies\" as\n\"a matter of procedural, not substantive, law.\"  Turner v.

It follows  a district\n\ncourt's  dismissal  of the  third  action  brought by  plaintiff-\n\nappellant  Scott   Martel  in   what  has  been   a  consistently\n\nunsuccessful effort  to  stay in  court  long enough  to  recover\n\ndamages  for  personal   injuries  sustained  in   an  automobile\n\naccident.      Because   the  district   court   lacked  personal\n\njurisdiction  over the sole defendant, a foreign executor sued as\n\nsuch, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Leaving to  one side the seepage  from the geographical\n\nmorass  in  which this  case is  mired,  the prefatory  facts are\n\nstraightforward.   On April 18,  1985, an accident  occurred on a\n\nVermont highway.  Martel,  a Vermont resident, sustained injuries\n\nwhen an automobile in which he was riding collided with a vehicle\n\ndriven  by Wilhelmina S. Parker.   Parker, a  citizen of Maryland\n\nwho was  in the process  of moving  into a new  home in  Vermont,\n\nperished two days  later as an aftermath of the  crash.  She died\n\ntestate,  owning property  located  exclusively in  Maryland  and\n\nVermont.    Pursuant   to  her  will,  probate   courts  in  both\n\njurisdictions  appointed  George  F.  Stafford,  a  Massachusetts\n\nresident, as executor.   Letters of administration were issued to\n\nStafford  in Maryland on  May 22,  1985 and  letters testamentary\n\nwere issued to him in Vermont on August 19, 1985.\n\n          Martel seemed to  be in no  particular hurry to  assert\n\nhis rights.   It was  not until  April 18, 1988  that he  brought\n\n                                3\n\nidentical  suits against Stafford in a Vermont state court and in\n\nVermont's  federal district  court.   In due  course, each  court\n\ndismissed Martel's  complaint as  time-barred on the  ground that\n\nthe  applicable statute of  limitations pretermitted  the action.\n\nSee  Vt.  Stat. Ann.  tit. 12,     557(a) (1973)  (providing that\n   \n\nactions against an executor  for acts of the decedent  are barred\n\nif  not commenced  within two  years of  the issuance  of letters\n\ntestamentary).\n\n          Undeterred,  appellant  went  in  search  of  a  longer\n\nstatute  of limitations.1    On November  22,  1988, he  filed  a\n\ndiversity  action in  the United  States District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.  Over two years later,  Stafford moved\n\nfor  summary judgment  on a  bouillabaisse of  grounds, including\n\nstatute  of   limitations,  res  judicata,  absence  of  personal\n\njurisdiction,  and  forum non  conveniens.    The district  court\n\ngranted the motion  on the basis of res judicata,  but offered no\n\nelaboration.  This appeal ensued.2\n\nII.

Saporita illustrates the point.\n                                          \n\nThere,  a  Massachusetts  resident  sued a  foreign  executor  to\n\nrecover  payment for  services  rendered to  the  testator.   The\n\nMassachusetts Supreme  Judicial  Court  (SJC)  approved  a  state\n\ncourt's  exercise  of  personal jurisdiction  over  the executor,\n\nprimarily because  the testator  had a  wealth  of contacts  with\n\nMassachusetts.  See id. at 618.

See id. at  612-13.  The contract upon which  she\n                       \n\nsued had been made and  performed there.  See id.

See id. at 611-12.   In the last analysis, it was\n                       \n\nthe testator's contacts with  Massachusetts that prompted the SJC\n\nto relax the traditional rule and find personal jurisdiction over\n\nthe foreign executor.   The court  reasoned that, given  contacts\n\n\"sufficient  .  .  . to  allow  the  court  to exercise  personal\n\njurisdiction over [the testator],\"  substituting an executor who,\n\nalthough appointed  in a foreign jurisdiction,  had himself lived\n\nand  worked  in Massachusetts  and who  had  been served  in hand\n\nthere, would \"not alter the court's jurisdiction.\"  Id. at 618.\n                                                       \n\n          The  case  before  us  is  at  a  considerable  remove.\n\nDespite ample  time for pretrial discovery,  the record discloses\n\nno  relationship between the decedent and the forum state.5  From\n\naught   that   appears,  Parker   had   not  a   single   tie  to\n\n                    \n\n     5It is  apodictic  that  a plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of\nproving facts necessary to establish jurisdiction.

And, moreover,  the cause of action arose  out of\n\nstate.  Had Parker  survived and Martel attempted  to sue in  the\n\nCommonwealth, there is not the slightest reason to believe that a\n\nMassachusetts court  could  have obtained  jurisdiction over  her\n\nperson.  Here, then, unlike in  Saporita, allowing the suit to go\n                                        \n\nforward based on the foreign executor's presence in Massachusetts\n\nwould significantly alter the jurisdictional calculus.\n\n          We have  said enough.   Because the  Saporita exception\n                                                       \n\nconfers personal  jurisdiction over a foreign  executor only when\n\nthe testator manifests sufficient contacts  with Massachusetts to\n\nsupport the exercise of jurisdiction, not merely when the foreign\n\nexecutor is  within  the  physical  reach of  a  process  server,\n\nParker's  behavioral  patterns  assume   decretory  significance.\n\nBecause she forged no links of any kind with Massachusetts in her\n\nlifetime, her executor's Massachusetts  residency cannot tilt the\n\njurisdictional balance.  And  putting Stafford's residency aside,\n\nappellant has  identified no other state-law  basis for grounding\n\npersonal  jurisdiction.   For our  part, we  can envision  none.6\n\nTherefore,  we  must  apply  the  traditional  rule.    Under it,\n\nStafford,   like  the   stereotypical  foreign  executor,   is  a\n\nnonentity, ergo,  not amenable to  suit beyond the  boundaries of\n\nthe  state(s)  of   his  appointment.     Giving  force  to   the\n\n                    \n\n     6The other exceptions to the traditional rule, see Saporita,\n                                                                \n371 Mass. at  615-17, are  plainly inapposite, as  are two  state\nstatutes  authorizing jurisdiction over  foreign executors upon a\nshowing of sufficient decedent  contacts with Massachusetts.  See\n                                                                 \nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 90,   3A (1990);  Mass. Gen.

Absent some  persuasive\n\nindication  that   a  Massachusetts  court   would  abandon   its\n\nlongstanding rule  to find jurisdiction on these specific facts  \n\nan extremely dubious prospect given that  the lawsuit's center of\n\ngravity  obviously lies  elsewhere7    we are  not at  liberty to\n\nmanufacture  a basis for ignoring  the rule.

While the SJC is free to\n\nreshape  Massachusetts's judge-made  law, we  are not;  rather, a\n\ndiversity court, with  exceptions not germane to  this case, must\n\ntake state law as it stands.\n\n                      B.  Consent (Waiver).\n                                          \n\n          Appellant  argues   that  Stafford  consented   to  the\n\njurisdiction of a Massachusetts  court, or, alternatively, waived\n\n                    \n\n     7We  think  it unlikely  that the  SJC  would fashion  a new\nexception to  an old  and honored  jurisdictional rule  where, as\nhere,  the  plaintiff  is a  non-resident,  the  decedent had  no\ncontacts with Massachusetts, the cause of action arose in another\nplace,  and no discernible state  interest would be  served by an\nassertion of jurisdiction.\n\n                                10\n\nhis jurisdictional defense,8 by  means of statements contained in\n\na  brief  filed  in the  United  States  District  Court for  the\n\nDistrict of  Vermont.    There,  the defendant,  in  response  to\n\nplaintiff's  threat  to bring  an  action  in Maryland's  federal\n\ndistrict   court,   speculated   that,   because   of  Stafford's\n\nMassachusetts  residency,  the proper  fall-back  forum would  be\n\nMassachusetts, not Maryland.\n\n          Appellant's  basic  premise  is  sound:   a  party  may\n\nconsent  to  a  court's   in  personam  jurisdiction  before  the\n                                      \n\ncommencement of an action.  See, e.g., National Equipment Rental,\n                                                                 \n\nLtd. v.

But,  consent to personal  jurisdiction cannot\n\nbe said to have  occurred here.  The allegedly  consenting words,\n\nburied, as they were,  in a responsive argument to  a speculative\n\nthreat in a prior suit before a different court  and concerning a\n\nmatter unrelated to that suit's determination, dealt with a topic\n\nwholly separate  from the issue of personal  jurisdiction.
