Claimant, Anibal Baez Velez,  appeals\n                    \n\nfrom  a district court  decision affirming the  denial of his\n\napplication   for   Social   Security  disability   benefits.\n\nClaimant alleges  that a  fractured wrist and  dislocated hip\n\nand the resulting pain therefrom have left him disabled.  The\n\nAdministrative  Law  Judge   (ALJ)  concluded  that  although\n\nclaimant's  impairments were  severe,  they did  not meet  or\n\nequal  a  listed impairment.    Claimant  was prevented  from\n\nperforming his  past work as  a construction worker  and fast\n\nfood restaurant crew member,  the ALJ concluded, but  was not\n\nprecluded from performing a  significant number of other jobs\n\nin  the national  economy  which require  sedentary to  light\n\nwork.   In  so  concluding,  the  ALJ found  that  claimant's\n\nallegations of  severe and disabling pain  were not credible.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     Claimant was born in 1967.  He completed high school and\n\none  year  of  college and  has  worked  in  the construction\n\nbusiness and in fast food restaurants.  On November 22, 1989,\n\nclaimant fell  from a  second story, sustaining  the injuries\n\ncomplained of in his application for disability payments.  He\n\nhas  not worked  since then.   Claimant  was admitted  to the\n\nhospital following his fall and was diagnosed with a fracture\n\nof  his  right  wrist, a  dislocation  of  his  left hip  and\n\n                             -2-\n\nfractures of several  ribs.   He stayed in  the hospital  for\n\nfifteen days.\n\n     Claimant  filed  an   application  for  Social  Security\n\ndisability  benefits on September 5, 1990, alleging inability\n\nto work due to the following severe impairments:\n\n     [M]y left  hip always gives  away (fails me)  and I\n     feel too  much pain.   And my  right wrist  doesn't\n     function as it did before and frequently hurts. . .\n     .  I don't have the same strength that I had before\n     in  my  right  hand;  I can't  lift  heavy  objects\n     because I feel  pain; when I  remain seated for  an\n     extended  period of time and try to get up, my left\n     hip becomes stiff and fixed in place and it hurts a\n     lot; if I  stand for  extended periods  I begin  to\n     suffer from back pain and hip pain.\n\nThe   Social   Security   Administration  denied   claimant's\n\napplication initially and on reconsideration.  \n\n     Claimant obtained  a hearing before  an ALJ on  July 18,\n\n1991.  Claimant  was represented  by counsel.   A  Vocational\n\nExpert also testified at the hearing.  The ALJ, in a decision\n\ndated August  27, 1991, concluded that  claimant \"has status,\n\npost-fracture of  right radius  dislocation of left  hip with\n\nminor residuals\" but that these impairments are not listed or\n\nmedically equal to those  listed at 20 C.F.R. Pt.  404, Subp.\n\nP, Appendix 1,  (\"Appendix 1\").   With respect to  claimant's\n\nallegations of pain in his arm,  back and hip, the ALJ  found\n\nthem to  be \"credible  so as  to  preclude arduous  exertion,\n\nrepeated bending, continuous standing  and walking.\"  The ALJ\n\nrejected appellant's  contention, however, that his  pain was\n\n\"of such  severity and  frequency as to  preclude substantial\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ngainful activity.\"  The ALJ found that claimant was precluded\n\nfrom  performing his past relevant work, but that he \"has the\n\nresidual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light\n\nto  sedentary  work.\"    The  ALJ  therefore  concluded  that\n\nclaimant was  not disabled within  the meaning of  the Social\n\nSecurity Act at any  time prior to the date of  that decision\n\nand, accordingly, was not entitled to disability payments.1 \n\n     Claimant's request for review by the Appeals Council was\n\ndenied, and on January  17, 1992, claimant filed a  complaint\n\nwith the district court seeking review of the ALJ's decision,\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C.   405 (g).  The district court affirmed\n\nthe ALJ's denial  of disability payments in  a decision dated\n\nOctober  15, 1992.   The  district court  found that  the ALJ\n\n\"properly discussed  in his decision  the reasons why  he did\n\nnot find plaintiff's subjective symptoms of pain credible\" in\n\naccordance  with the  requirements of  Avery v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth and Human Services,  797 F.2d 19, 22 (1st  Cir. 1986),\n                         \n\nand  \"took into  account evidence  such as  plaintiff's daily\n\nactivities and  observations of examining doctors in reaching\n\nhis  conclusion, as  well as  the  testimony of  a vocational\n\nexpert.\" (Citations omitted.)\n\n                       Medical Evidence\n                                       \n\n                    \n\n1.   The ALJ  found that claimant met  the disability insured\nstatus requirements of the Social Security Act on the date of\nhis accident and continued to meet them through at least June\n30,  1990.  The exact date on which claimant's insured status\nexpired was uncertain because of unposted 1989 earnings.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n     Since his accident, claimant has been seen by doctors at\n\nthe State Insurance Fund (S.I.F.) and by a private orthopedic\n\nsurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Pinero Pereira.   While in the hospital,\n\nclaimant's  hip was  treated  with \"Buck's  traction\" and  on\n\nDecember 5, 1989, Dr. Pinero performed  an \"external fixation\n\nand closed reduction\" on claimant's right wrist.\n\n     On December  19, 1989, Dr. Pinero  examined claimant and\n\nreported that  there was  decreased external rotation  in his\n\nleft  hip, but that he had full flexion and no \"neurovascular\n\ndeficit.\"  His  right wrist  was tender and  his flexion  was\n\ndecreased, but he could  fully extend his fingers and  had no\n\nsensory deficit.  Dr.  Pinero prescribed physical therapy and\n\nordered a CT scan and follow-up visit.\n\n     In February, 1990, claimant  complained to an SIF doctor\n\nof  pain  in his  pelvis.   A  CT  scan of  claimant's pelvis\n\nperformed  on   February   20,  1990   showed  small   linear\n\ncalcification in the joint  space and small calcifications in\n\nthe acetabulum  and in the  femoral neck.   The radiologist's\n\nreport indicated  that the  calcification in the  joint space\n\nmight  represent an  interarticular  osseous  fragment.   The\n\nother   calcifictions   were    compatible   with    myositis\n\nossificans.2  Dr.  Pinero saw claimant  again in April,  1990\n\n                    \n\n2.    Myositis  ossificans is  the inflammation  of a  muscle\ncharacterized by bony deposits or ossification of muscles. R.\nSloane, The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary\n                                                             \n(1987).\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nand reported  that he had  full range of  motion in  his hip,\n\nexcept  that he still  had decreased external  rotation.  Dr.\n\nPinero warned claimant that he might develop arthritis in his\n\nhip  if osteochondral  fragments  were not  removed from  the\n\njoint.\n\n     Claimant  saw  an  SIF  doctor  on  April  25, 1990  and\n\ncomplained of pain in his hip. Notes from that visit indicate\n\nthat  he  limped  a  little  and  had  limited  anterior  and\n\nposterior flexion.  Physical therapy was recommended.  On May\n\n2,  1990, claimant saw an SIF doctor again.  The record shows\n\nthat claimant  had markedly  limited range of  motion in  his\n\nwrist, reduced  grip strength and  mild engrossment.   He was\n\nable to make a  tight fist.  Claimant complained  of constant\n\nwrist pain,  but did not  experience numbness.   He indicated\n\nthat  he used his wrist  for activities of  daily living, but\n\ncould  not   lift  heavy  objects.     Physical  therapy  was\n\nrecommended  to  increase  claimant's  range  of  motion  and\n\nstrength and to decrease his pain.  The record from a May 14,\n\n1990 visit with  Dr. Pinero indicates  that claimant had  80%\n\nsupination and  full  pronation of  his  wrist.   The  doctor\n\nordered a  wrist x-ray  and a  follow-up appointment  in four\n\nweeks.\n\n     A  May  18, 1990  report  from  the SIF  indicates  that\n\nclaimant had  reported no benefit from  physical therapy, but\n\nthat his grip  strength had increased.   Claimant's range  of\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion had increased slightly, although  it remained markedly\n\nlimited.  A May 21,  1990 report from Dr. Carlos  Fuxench, an\n\nSIF  physiatrist, indicated that  claimant was able to make a\n\nfist and that  the range of  motion in his finger  joints was\n\ncomplete.   Dr. Pinero   examined claimant on  June 25, 1990.\n\nHe  indicated that claimant had  full range of  motion in his\n\nhip, but that  external rotation was  painful.  He  diagnosed\n\npost-traumatic degenerative joint  disease of the left  hip.3\n\n     In September, 1990, claimant visited an SIF doctor again\n\nand reportedly complained of pain in  his wrist and hip.  The\n\ndoctor noted that  claimant was  leaning on a  cane to  walk,\n\nwhich exacerbated  the pain in his wrist.  A November 5, 1990\n\nreport  from the  SIF indicated  that claimant  complained of\n\npain in  his wrist,  but  that there  was no  edema and  that\n\nflexion and extension were accomplished with difficulty.  Dr.\n\nTorres from the SIF examined  claimant on November 14,  1990,\n\nand noted  that the pain  in claimant's hip  was intermittent\n\nand worsened when he  leaned forward.  Although the  area was\n\ntender, Dr. Torres  reported that claimant had full  range of\n\nmotion and muscle strength in his left hip.  He also reported\n\n                    \n\n3.  Degenerative   joint   disease   is    characterized   by\ndegeneration of  the articular cartilage, hypertrophy of bone\nat the margins, and changes in the synovial membrane.  \"It is\naccompanied  by   pain  and  stiffness,   particularly  after\nprolonged  activity.\"  The Sloane-Dorland  Annotated Medical-\n                                                             \nLegal Dictionary.\n                \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthat claimant was walking adequately unassisted. He diagnosed\n\ntrochanteric  bursitis.4    Continued  pain   medication  and\n\nstretching exercises were prescribed. \n\n      In December, 1990, the SIF doctors prescribed 20 mg/day\n\nof Feldene  (a medication  given to inhibit  inflammation and\n\npain).  Claimant complained of pain in his wrist and hip.  In\n\nJanuary,  1991, Dr. Pinero saw  claimant and reported that he\n\ncomplained of intermittent episodes of  pain.  He noted  that\n\nthe  hip  dislocation  would  probably  lead   to  arthritis,\n\nrequiring  further  surgery,  but  that  claimant  wanted  to\n\npostpone  surgery until  the  pain became  intolerable.   Dr.\n\nPinero recommended  x-rays.   The x-ray report  indicated \"no\n\nevidence of  recent fracture,  soft tissue  calcifications or\n\nother complication\"  in claimant's wrist. The  x-ray showed a\n\n\"deformity  in  the  distal  radius and  the  ulnar  styloid,\n\npresumably  result of an old healed fracture.\"  The hip x-ray\n\nindicated  \"a  bony  projection  arising  from  the   greater\n\ntrochanter of the femur which may be related to tendinitis or\n\nto  previous traumatic episodes.\"  There was no evidence of a\n\npresent  or  past  hip   fracture  and  the  \"sacroiliac  and\n\ncoxofemoral joint spaces\" were preserved.\n\n                    \n\n4.    Bursitis  is the  inflammation of  a  bursa, \"a  sac or\nsaclike  cavity  filled with  viscid  fluid  and situated  at\nplaces  in  the tissues  at  which  friction would  otherwise\nresult.\"    The   Sloane-Dorland    Annotated   Medical-Legal\n                                                             \nDictionary.\n          \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n     Claimant's final  reported visit with Dr.  Pinero was on\n\nFebruary  5,  1991.     The  doctor  reported  that  claimant\n\ncomplained  of  hip  pain,  but that  he  had  full  flexion,\n\ninternal rotation and abduction in his hip, and 40%  external\n\nrotation.   The  report noted  that the  x-rays showed  post-\n\ntraumatic degenerative joint disease which might explain pain\n\nsymptoms.   Dr. Pinero also  noted that avascular necrosis is\n\nanother complication that  can occur with degenerative  joint\n\ndisease and  explain pain.5  Finally,  Dr. Pinero recommended\n\nthat if  conservative treatment  fails, claimant \"could  be a\n\ncandidate for hip fusion.\"  \n\n     On  March  20,  1991,    claimant  saw  an  SIF  doctor.\n\nAlthough claimant complained  of pain in  his hip and  wrist,\n\nthe report noted no edema and no deficit in flexion-extension\n\nand  that fingers  close.   No  difficult gait  was observed.\n\nFinally, a June  20, 1991  report from an  SIF doctor  stated\n\nthat  claimant  is  not  willing  to  undergo a  hip  fusion,\n\nalthough he still complained of pain in his hip and forearm.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n     On appeal, claimant argues that the decision to deny him\n\ndisability benefits is not supported by substantial evidence.\n\nClaimant   specifically  contends   that  the   finding  that\n\n                    \n\n5.    Avascular necrosis  describes \"the sum of morphological\nchanges indicative  of cell death\" caused  by deficient blood\nsupply  to the  affected  area. The  Sloane-Dorland Annotated\n                                                             \nMedical-Legal Dictionary.\n                        \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nclaimant's medical  condition does not meet  or equal listing\n\n1.03 (arthritis of a  major weight-bearing joint) in Appendix\n\n1  of the  regulations was  erroneous and  that the  district\n\ncourt, in affirming the denial, failed to give proper  credit\n\nto claimant's subjective complaints of pain.\n\n     The  Social  Security   Act  establishes  the  following\n\nstandard  of  review in  this  case: \"[t]he  findings  of the\n\nSecretary  as  to  any  fact,  if  supported  by  substantial\n\nevidence, shall be  conclusive, . . . \"   42 U.S.C.   405(g).\n\nTherefore,   the  Secretary's   decision  to   deny  claimant\n\ndisability payments  in  this case  must  be affirmed  \"if  a\n\nreasonable mind,  reviewing the evidence  in the record  as a\n\nwhole,   could  accept   it  as   adequate  to   support  his\n\nconclusion.\"    Rodriguez  v.  Secretary of  Health  &amp;  Human\n                                                             \n\nServices,  647  F.2d 218,  222 (1st  Cir.  1981). \"It  is the\n        \n\nresponsibility  of  the  Secretary  to  determine  issues  of\n\ncredibility and to draw inferences from the record evidence.\"\n\nOrtiz  v.

Second, he determined that  claimant\n\nhad    a    severe   impairment,    termed   \"musculoskeletal\n\ninvolvement.\"    Third,  the  ALJ  concluded  that claimant's\n\nimpairments did not meet or equal the criteria in the Listing\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof  Impairments in Appendix 1 of the regulations.  Fourth, he\n\nfound  that   claimant's   impairment  prevented   him   from\n\nperforming his  past relevant  work as a  construction worker\n\nand a crew  member at a  fast food restaurant.   Finally, the\n\nALJ  concluded   that  although   claimant  was  limited   to\n\nperforming sedentary  to light work, his  impairments did not\n\nprevent  him from doing any  other work.   Therefore, the ALJ\n\nfound the claimant not disabled.\n\n     Claimant takes  issue on appeal with  the ALJ's findings\n\nat  steps three  and  five.     He argues  that  his combined\n\nimpairments \"meet  in  severity the  musculoskeletal  listing\n\ncriteria.\"  Specifically, claimant argues that his hip injury\n\nmeets the  musculoskeletal impairment listed at  section 1.03\n\nof  Appendix 1:  \"arthritis of  a major  weight-bearing joint\n\n(due to any cause).\"   While conceding that his  wrist injury\n\ndoes not alone  meet or equal  a listed impairment,  claimant\n\nargues that when   the hip and wrist injury are  evaluated in\n\ncombination they meet or equal the severity of the impairment\n\nlisted at section 1.03.\n\n     Section 1.03 provides as follows:\n\n          1.03 Arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint\n                                                        \n     (due to any cause):\n                       \n          With  history of  persistent  joint  pain  and\n     stiffness with signs of marked limitation of motion\n     or abnormal motion of the affected joint on current\n     physical examination.

Reconstructive    surgery   or   surgical\n     arthrodesis  of  a major  weight-bearing  joint and\n     return to full weight-bearing status did not occur,\n     or  is not expected  to occur, within  12 months of\n     onset.\n\n20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subp. P, Appendix 1,   1.03.  \n\n     Claimant has  the burden of demonstrating  the existence\n\nof  an impairment or combination  of impairments that meet or\n\nequal the criteria in the Listing of  Impairments at Appendix\n\n1.  See Dudley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 816\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 792, 793 (1st Cir. 1987).  There is substantial evidence\n\nto support the ALJ's determination that claimant did not meet\n\nthis  burden.  Section 1.03 of the listings requires a \"gross\n\nanatomical deformity . . . markedly limiting ability to  walk\n\nand stand.\"   The  ALJ specifically  found that  \"since about\n\nSeptember  1990 the record fails  to show ongoing  use of [a]\n\ncane [to  assist ambulation].\"   In  addition, the ALJ  noted\n\nthat \"[d]uring the hearing  on July 8, 1991 the  claimant was\n\nobserved  to walk  without the  use  of a  cane\" and  that he\n\n\"stood for 10 minutes early in the hearing.\"  \n\n     The medical  evidence,  summarized above,  supports  the\n\nALJ's  finding  that the  injury did  not  meet or  equal the\n\nlisting  criteria.  Claimant was observed to limp a little at\n\nhis  April, 1990 visit to the  SIF and at his September, 1990\n\nvisit  claimant  used  a  cane.    Dr.  Pinero's  June,  1990\n\nexamination of claimant, however,  indicated that he had full\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nrange of motion  in his hip,  although external rotation  was\n\npainful.    In  November,  1990,  Dr.  Torres  reported  that\n\nclaimant  had full range of motion and muscle strength in his\n\nhip  and that  claimant was \"walking  adequately unassisted.\"\n\nIn February, 1991, Dr. Pinero reported that claimant had full\n\nflexion, internal rotation and  abduction.  Finally, on March\n\n20, 1991, an  SIF report  notes that \"no  difficult gait  was\n\nobserved.\"     Claimant's  wrist  injury   cannot,  even   in\n\ncombination with his hip  injury, satisfy the requirements of\n\n   1.03.    Therefore, the  district  judge  did  not err  in\n\naffirming the ALJ's determination that  claimant's impairment\n\ndid not meet or equal a listed impairment.6\n\n     Claimant argues that the ALJ erred in not obtaining  the\n\nassistance  of  a  medical  expert in  order  to  assess  the\n\nseverity of claimant's physical limitations  and whether they\n\nequal  a  listed impairment.    It does  not  require medical\n\nexpertise, however, to determine whether claimant is markedly\n\nlimited in his  ability to walk or stand,  a requirement of  \n\n1.03 of  the listings.   Therefore,  the ALJ  did not err  in\n\nmaking this commonsense judgment  without the assistance of a\n\n                    \n\n6.  Claimant also suggests that his impairments meet or equal\nthe  impairments  listed at  sections  1.04 and  1.12  of the\nAppendix.   Section 1.04, however, requires  arthritis of one\nmajor joint in each  of the upper extremities.   Section 1.12\n                   \nrequires fracture of an  upper extremity where functional use\nis  not restored within twelve months.   The medical evidence\nsupports the  ALJ's conclusion that  these requirements  were\nnot met.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nmedical  expert.   (Cf.  Gordils v.  Secretary of  Health and\n                                                             \n\nHuman Services,  921  F.2d 327,  329  (1st Cir.  1990)  (\"the\n              \n\nSecretary  is   not  precluded  from   rendering  commonsense\n\njudgments   about  functional   capacity  based   on  medical\n\nfindings,  as long  as the  Secretary does  not overstep  the\n\nbounds  of a  lay  person's competence  and render  a medical\n\njudgment.\").\n\n     Claimant  also alleges on  appeal that  the ALJ  did not\n\nadequately consider  his allegations of disabling  pain.  The\n\nALJ found that claimant's  allegations of pain were \"credible\n\nso   as  to  preclude  arduous  exertion,  repeated  bending,\n\ncontinuous standing and  walking.  Otherwise they  are not of\n\nsuch  severity  and  frequency  as  to  preclude  substantial\n\ngainful activity.\"   The ALJ considered  claimant's testimony\n\nin light  of the other  record evidence.   Claimant testified\n\nthat  he sometimes experiences  shooting pains extending from\n\nhis  back to  his hip.   He  stated that  he was  taking pain\n\nmedication (\"Dolabid\") two or  three times a day and  that it\n\nsometimes helped.  Claimant  also testified that the  pain in\n\nhis  back and hip  was constant and  that it hurt  his arm to\n\nlift twenty  pounds or to continually  carry lighter weights.\n\nHe stated that it hurt his wrist to grasp something.\n\n     The  record  contains  objective  medical   evidence  of\n\nimpairments  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  cause\n\nclaimant  pain.   Dr.  Pinero diagnosed  claimant with  post-\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\ntraumatic degenerative joint disease  in his left hip.   This\n\ncondition is \"accompanied by pain and stiffness, particularly\n\nafter  prolonged activity.\"   R.  Sloane, The  Sloane Dorland\n                                                             \n\nAnnotated Medical-Legal Dictionary  (1987).  Dr.  Pinero also\n                                  \n\nnoted  that avascular  necrosis can  occur  with degenerative\n\njoint disease and cause pain.  Dr. Torres diagnosed bursitis,\n\nwhich  has   been  characterized   as  a   medical  condition\n\n\"reasonably capable  of causing  disabling pain.\"   Sewell v.\n                                                          \n\nBowen, 792  F.2d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir. 1986). Nonetheless, as\n     \n\nthe  ALJ  noted  in  his  decision, \"[t]he  record  fails  to\n\nestablish  significant or  persistent weakness  or functional\n\nlimitation.\"  The ALJ  concluded that claimant's  allegations\n\nof  severe  and  disabling  pain  were  \"unsupported  by  the\n\nobjective findings  which fail to disclose  severe osseous or\n\nneurological involvement or residuals.\"\n\n     Where  allegations of disabling  pain are unsupported by\n\nobjective  medical evidence,  the ALJ  is required  to obtain\n\ndetailed   descriptions   of  claimant's   daily  activities,\n\nfunctional restrictions, medication  and other treatment  for\n\npain, frequency  and duration of pain,  and precipitating and\n\naggravating factors.   See Avery  v. Secretary of  Health and\n                                                             \n\nHuman  Services,  797  F.2d  at  23;  SSR  88-13.    The  ALJ\n               \n\nthoroughly  questioned claimant in  accordance with the above\n\nrequirements.  Claimant testified  at his hearing  before the\n\nALJ that he used his right hand for eating, dressing, writing\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nand shaving.  He  further testified that he  sometimes lifted\n\nhis two-year-old  child.   In his application  for disability\n\npayments,   claimant  described   his  daily   activities  as\n\nincluding house cleaning,  taking out the  garbage, shopping,\n\ndoing the dishes, visiting  friends, attending church and the\n\nmovies.   At  his hearing,  however, claimant  testified that\n\ntypically he spent all day watching television.\n\n     The  ALJ specifically found  that claimant's allegations\n\nof  severe and  disabling  pain  were  not  credible.    This\n\ncredibility  determination,  especially  when   supported  by\n\nspecific findings,  is entitled  to deference.   Fustaglia v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services,  829 F.2d  192, 195\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir.  1987).   In addition  to  the lack  of supportive\n\nobjective  medical  evidence, the  ALJ  also  found that  the\n\nallegations  were  unsupported  by  claimant's  \"conservative\n\ntreatment, his  demeanor,  his daily  activities,  and  other\n\nevidence of record.\"    The ALJ found claimant's  allegations\n\nof  pain credible  only  to the  extent  that they  \"preclude\n\narduous exertion, repeated  bending, continuous standing  and\n\nwalking.\"   He  therefore  made  the following  determination\n\nregarding claimant's residual functional capacity:\n\n     The claimant has  the residual functional  capacity\n     to perform the  physical exertional requirements of\n     work   except   for   arduous  physical   exertion,\n     repetitive,  bending, lifting or carrying in excess\n     of 20 lbs or continuous standing or sitting.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n     This   conclusion  is  substantially  supported  by  the\n\nmedical evidence  summarized above.   In May,  1990, claimant\n\ntold a treating  physician at the SIF that he  used his wrist\n\nfor activities of  daily living, although  he could not  lift\n\nheavy objects.   A May,  1990 report from  the SIF  indicated\n\nthat  claimant's  grip  strength  and  range  of  motion  had\n\nincreased.  An  x-ray report from 1991 indicated \"no evidence\n\nof  recent  fracture,  soft  tissue  calcifictions  or  other\n\ncomplication\"  in claimant's wrist.  After an  examination of\n\nclaimant on November 14,  1990, Dr. Torres reported  that the\n\npain in his hip was intermittent.   A March, 1991 report from\n\nSIF indicated no edema and no deficit in flexion-extension of\n\nclaimant's  wrist.    A  February, 1991  report  by  treating\n\nphysician  Dr.  Pinero  indicated   that  claimant  had  full\n\nflexion, internal rotation and abduction in his hip,  and 40%\n\nexternal rotation.\n\n     The RFC  form completed  by a nonexamining  physician on\n\nMarch  21, 1991, also supports  the ALJ's findings.   The RFC\n\nreveals that  claimant occasionally can lift  and carry fifty\n\npounds and frequently can  lift and carry twenty-five pounds.\n\nHe  can only  occasionally climb,  balance, kneel  and crawl.\n\nHowever,  he can sit, stand and walk  for up to six hours per\n\nwork  day.   He is  limited in  the weight  that he  can push\n\nand/or pull to ten pounds  because of his wrist injury.   The\n\nRFC also noted  that claimant's gross  manipulation abilities\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwere  limited  somewhat by  his  wrist injury,  but  that his\n\nreaching and fine manipulation abilities were not limited.\n\n     The  vocational expert  testified  that there  were jobs\n\nexisting in significant numbers in the national economy which\n\nclaimant can perform, given his residual functional capacity,\n\nage,  education  and work  experience.    These included  the\n\nfollowing  light to  sedentary  semi-skilled  jobs:  cashier,\n\ncounter clerk, shipping clerk and general office clerk.\n\n     Having reviewed the entire  record, we conclude that the\n\nALJ's  findings  are   supported  by  substantial   evidence,\n\nincluding   medical   evidence   from   claimant's   treating\n\nphysicians, claimant's  testimony at  the hearing before  the\n\nALJ, the RFC  prepared by a  non-examining physician and  the\n\ntestimony of the  vocational expert.  Where  the facts permit\n\ndiverse  inferences, we will affirm the  Secretary so long as\n\nthe   inferences  drawn  are   supported  by   the  evidence.\n\nRodriguez Pagan  v.

Therefore, the district court\n\ndid  not   err  in  affirming  the   ALJ's  decision  denying\n\ndisability payments.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons,  the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n",

Claimant, Anibal Baez Velez,  appeals\n                    \n\nfrom  a district court  decision affirming the  denial of his\n\napplication   for   Social   Security  disability   benefits.\n\nClaimant alleges  that a  fractured wrist and  dislocated hip\n\nand the resulting pain therefrom have left him disabled.  The\n\nAdministrative  Law  Judge   (ALJ)  concluded  that  although\n\nclaimant's  impairments were  severe,  they did  not meet  or\n\nequal  a  listed impairment.    Claimant  was prevented  from\n\nperforming his  past work as  a construction worker  and fast\n\nfood restaurant crew member,  the ALJ concluded, but  was not\n\nprecluded from performing a  significant number of other jobs\n\nin  the national  economy  which require  sedentary to  light\n\nwork.   In  so  concluding,  the  ALJ found  that  claimant's\n\nallegations of  severe and disabling pain  were not credible.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     Claimant was born in 1967.  He completed high school and\n\none  year  of  college and  has  worked  in  the construction\n\nbusiness and in fast food restaurants.  On November 22, 1989,\n\nclaimant fell  from a  second story, sustaining  the injuries\n\ncomplained of in his application for disability payments.  He\n\nhas  not worked  since then.   Claimant  was admitted  to the\n\nhospital following his fall and was diagnosed with a fracture\n\nof  his  right  wrist, a  dislocation  of  his  left hip  and\n\n                             -2-\n\nfractures of several  ribs.   He stayed in  the hospital  for\n\nfifteen days.\n\n     Claimant  filed  an   application  for  Social  Security\n\ndisability  benefits on September 5, 1990, alleging inability\n\nto work due to the following severe impairments:\n\n     [M]y left  hip always gives  away (fails me)  and I\n     feel too  much pain.   And my  right wrist  doesn't\n     function as it did before and frequently hurts. . .\n     .  I don't have the same strength that I had before\n     in  my  right  hand;  I can't  lift  heavy  objects\n     because I feel  pain; when I  remain seated for  an\n     extended  period of time and try to get up, my left\n     hip becomes stiff and fixed in place and it hurts a\n     lot; if I  stand for  extended periods  I begin  to\n     suffer from back pain and hip pain.\n\nThe   Social   Security   Administration  denied   claimant's\n\napplication initially and on reconsideration.  \n\n     Claimant obtained  a hearing before  an ALJ on  July 18,\n\n1991.  Claimant  was represented  by counsel.   A  Vocational\n\nExpert also testified at the hearing.  The ALJ, in a decision\n\ndated August  27, 1991, concluded that  claimant \"has status,\n\npost-fracture of  right radius  dislocation of left  hip with\n\nminor residuals\" but that these impairments are not listed or\n\nmedically equal to those  listed at 20 C.F.R. Pt.  404, Subp.\n\nP, Appendix 1,  (\"Appendix 1\").   With respect to  claimant's\n\nallegations of pain in his arm,  back and hip, the ALJ  found\n\nthem to  be \"credible  so as  to  preclude arduous  exertion,\n\nrepeated bending, continuous standing  and walking.\"  The ALJ\n\nrejected appellant's  contention, however, that his  pain was\n\n\"of such  severity and  frequency as to  preclude substantial\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ngainful activity.\"  The ALJ found that claimant was precluded\n\nfrom  performing his past relevant work, but that he \"has the\n\nresidual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light\n\nto  sedentary  work.\"    The  ALJ  therefore  concluded  that\n\nclaimant was  not disabled within  the meaning of  the Social\n\nSecurity Act at any  time prior to the date of  that decision\n\nand, accordingly, was not entitled to disability payments.1 \n\n     Claimant's request for review by the Appeals Council was\n\ndenied, and on January  17, 1992, claimant filed a  complaint\n\nwith the district court seeking review of the ALJ's decision,\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C.   405 (g).  The district court affirmed\n\nthe ALJ's denial  of disability payments in  a decision dated\n\nOctober  15, 1992.   The  district court  found that  the ALJ\n\n\"properly discussed  in his decision  the reasons why  he did\n\nnot find plaintiff's subjective symptoms of pain credible\" in\n\naccordance  with the  requirements of  Avery v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth and Human Services,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st  Cir. 1986),\n                         \n\nand  \"took into  account evidence  such as  plaintiff's daily\n\nactivities and  observations of examining doctors in reaching\n\nhis  conclusion, as  well as  the  testimony of  a vocational\n\nexpert.\" (Citations omitted.)\n\n                       Medical Evidence\n                                       \n\n                    \n\n1.   The ALJ  found that claimant met  the disability insured\nstatus requirements of the Social Security Act on the date of\nhis accident and continued to meet them through at least June\n30,  1990.  The exact date on which claimant's insured status\nexpired was uncertain because of unposted 1989 earnings.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n     Since his accident, claimant has been seen by doctors at\n\nthe State Insurance Fund (S.I.F.) and by a private orthopedic\n\nsurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Pinero Pereira.   While in the hospital,\n\nclaimant's  hip was  treated  with \"Buck's  traction\" and  on\n\nDecember 5, 1989, Dr. Pinero performed  an \"external fixation\n\nand closed reduction\" on claimant's right wrist.\n\n     On December  19, 1989, Dr. Pinero  examined claimant and\n\nreported that  there was  decreased external rotation  in his\n\nleft  hip, but that he had full flexion and no \"neurovascular\n\ndeficit.\"  His  right wrist  was tender and  his flexion  was\n\ndecreased, but he could  fully extend his fingers and  had no\n\nsensory deficit.  Dr.  Pinero prescribed physical therapy and\n\nordered a CT scan and follow-up visit.\n\n     In February, 1990, claimant  complained to an SIF doctor\n\nof  pain  in his  pelvis.   A  CT  scan of  claimant's pelvis\n\nperformed  on   February   20,  1990   showed  small   linear\n\ncalcification in the joint  space and small calcifications in\n\nthe acetabulum  and in the  femoral neck.   The radiologist's\n\nreport indicated  that the  calcification in the  joint space\n\nmight  represent an  interarticular  osseous  fragment.   The\n\nother   calcifictions   were    compatible   with    myositis\n\nossificans.2  Dr.  Pinero saw claimant  again in April,  1990\n\n                    \n\n2.    Myositis  ossificans is  the inflammation  of a  muscle\ncharacterized by bony deposits or ossification of muscles.

Dr.\n\nPinero warned claimant that he might develop arthritis in his\n\nhip  if osteochondral  fragments  were not  removed from  the\n\njoint.\n\n     Claimant  saw  an  SIF  doctor  on  April  25, 1990  and\n\ncomplained of pain in his hip. Notes from that visit indicate\n\nthat  he  limped  a  little  and  had  limited  anterior  and\n\nposterior flexion.  Physical therapy was recommended.  On May\n\n2,  1990, claimant saw an SIF doctor again.  The record shows\n\nthat claimant  had markedly  limited range of  motion in  his\n\nwrist, reduced  grip strength and  mild engrossment.   He was\n\nable to make a  tight fist.  Claimant complained  of constant\n\nwrist pain,  but did not  experience numbness.   He indicated\n\nthat  he used his wrist  for activities of  daily living, but\n\ncould  not   lift  heavy  objects.     Physical  therapy  was\n\nrecommended  to  increase  claimant's  range  of  motion  and\n\nstrength and to decrease his pain.  The record from a May 14,\n\n1990 visit with  Dr. Pinero indicates  that claimant had  80%\n\nsupination and  full  pronation of  his  wrist.   The  doctor\n\nordered a  wrist x-ray  and a  follow-up appointment  in four\n\nweeks.\n\n     A  May  18, 1990  report  from  the SIF  indicates  that\n\nclaimant had  reported no benefit from  physical therapy, but\n\nthat his grip  strength had increased.   Claimant's range  of\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion had increased slightly, although  it remained markedly\n\nlimited.  A May 21,  1990 report from Dr. Carlos  Fuxench, an\n\nSIF  physiatrist, indicated that  claimant was able to make a\n\nfist and that  the range of  motion in his finger  joints was\n\ncomplete.   Dr. Pinero   examined claimant on  June 25, 1990.\n\nHe  indicated that claimant had  full range of  motion in his\n\nhip, but that  external rotation was  painful.  He  diagnosed\n\npost-traumatic degenerative joint  disease of the left  hip.3\n\n     In September, 1990, claimant visited an SIF doctor again\n\nand reportedly complained of pain in  his wrist and hip.  The\n\ndoctor noted that  claimant was  leaning on a  cane to  walk,\n\nwhich exacerbated  the pain in his wrist.  A November 5, 1990\n\nreport  from the  SIF indicated  that claimant  complained of\n\npain in  his wrist,  but  that there  was no  edema and  that\n\nflexion and extension were accomplished with difficulty.  Dr.\n\nTorres from the SIF examined  claimant on November 14,  1990,\n\nand noted  that the pain  in claimant's hip  was intermittent\n\nand worsened when he  leaned forward.  Although the  area was\n\ntender, Dr. Torres  reported that claimant had full  range of\n\nmotion and muscle strength in his left hip.  He also reported\n\n                    \n\n3.  Degenerative   joint   disease   is    characterized   by\ndegeneration of  the articular cartilage, hypertrophy of bone\nat the margins, and changes in the synovial membrane.  \"It is\naccompanied  by   pain  and  stiffness,   particularly  after\nprolonged  activity.\"  The Sloane-Dorland  Annotated Medical-\n                                                             \nLegal Dictionary.\n                \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthat claimant was walking adequately unassisted. He diagnosed\n\ntrochanteric  bursitis.4    Continued  pain   medication  and\n\nstretching exercises were prescribed. \n\n      In December, 1990, the SIF doctors prescribed 20 mg/day\n\nof Feldene  (a medication  given to inhibit  inflammation and\n\npain).  Claimant complained of pain in his wrist and hip.  In\n\nJanuary,  1991, Dr. Pinero saw  claimant and reported that he\n\ncomplained of intermittent episodes of  pain.  He noted  that\n\nthe  hip  dislocation  would  probably  lead   to  arthritis,\n\nrequiring  further  surgery,  but  that  claimant  wanted  to\n\npostpone  surgery until  the  pain became  intolerable.   Dr.\n\nPinero recommended  x-rays.   The x-ray report  indicated \"no\n\nevidence of  recent fracture,  soft tissue  calcifications or\n\nother complication\"  in claimant's wrist. The  x-ray showed a\n\n\"deformity  in  the  distal  radius and  the  ulnar  styloid,\n\npresumably  result of an old healed fracture.\"  The hip x-ray\n\nindicated  \"a  bony  projection  arising  from  the   greater\n\ntrochanter of the femur which may be related to tendinitis or\n\nto  previous traumatic episodes.\"  There was no evidence of a\n\npresent  or  past  hip   fracture  and  the  \"sacroiliac  and\n\ncoxofemoral joint spaces\" were preserved.\n\n                    \n\n4.    Bursitis  is the  inflammation of  a  bursa, \"a  sac or\nsaclike  cavity  filled with  viscid  fluid  and situated  at\nplaces  in  the tissues  at  which  friction would  otherwise\nresult.\"    The   Sloane-Dorland    Annotated   Medical-Legal\n                                                             \nDictionary.\n          \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n     Claimant's final  reported visit with Dr.  Pinero was on\n\nFebruary  5,  1991.     The  doctor  reported  that  claimant\n\ncomplained  of  hip  pain,  but that  he  had  full  flexion,\n\ninternal rotation and abduction in his hip, and 40%  external\n\nrotation.   The  report noted  that the  x-rays showed  post-\n\ntraumatic degenerative joint disease which might explain pain\n\nsymptoms.   Dr. Pinero also  noted that avascular necrosis is\n\nanother complication that  can occur with degenerative  joint\n\ndisease and  explain pain.5  Finally,  Dr. Pinero recommended\n\nthat if  conservative treatment  fails, claimant \"could  be a\n\ncandidate for hip fusion.\"  \n\n     On  March  20,  1991,    claimant  saw  an  SIF  doctor.\n\nAlthough claimant complained  of pain in  his hip and  wrist,\n\nthe report noted no edema and no deficit in flexion-extension\n\nand  that fingers  close.   No  difficult gait  was observed.\n\nFinally, a June  20, 1991  report from an  SIF doctor  stated\n\nthat  claimant  is  not  willing  to  undergo a  hip  fusion,\n\nalthough he still complained of pain in his hip and forearm.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n     On appeal, claimant argues that the decision to deny him\n\ndisability benefits is not supported by substantial evidence.\n\nClaimant   specifically  contends   that  the   finding  that\n\n                    \n\n5.

Second, he determined that  claimant\n\nhad    a    severe   impairment,    termed   \"musculoskeletal\n\ninvolvement.\"    Third,  the  ALJ  concluded  that claimant's\n\nimpairments did not meet or equal the criteria in the Listing\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof  Impairments in Appendix 1 of the regulations.  Fourth, he\n\nfound  that   claimant's   impairment  prevented   him   from\n\nperforming his  past relevant  work as a  construction worker\n\nand a crew  member at a  fast food restaurant.   Finally, the\n\nALJ  concluded   that  although   claimant  was  limited   to\n\nperforming sedentary  to light work, his  impairments did not\n\nprevent  him from doing any  other work.   Therefore, the ALJ\n\nfound the claimant not disabled.\n\n     Claimant takes  issue on appeal with  the ALJ's findings\n\nat  steps three  and  five.     He argues  that  his combined\n\nimpairments \"meet  in  severity the  musculoskeletal  listing\n\ncriteria.\"  Specifically, claimant argues that his hip injury\n\nmeets the  musculoskeletal impairment listed at  section 1.03\n\nof  Appendix 1:  \"arthritis of  a major  weight-bearing joint\n\n(due to any cause).\"   While conceding that his  wrist injury\n\ndoes not alone  meet or equal  a listed impairment,  claimant\n\nargues that when   the hip and wrist injury are  evaluated in\n\ncombination they meet or equal the severity of the impairment\n\nlisted at section 1.03.\n\n     Section 1.03 provides as follows:\n\n          1.03 Arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint\n                                                        \n     (due to any cause):\n                       \n          With  history of  persistent  joint  pain  and\n     stiffness with signs of marked limitation of motion\n     or abnormal motion of the affected joint on current\n     physical examination.

There is substantial evidence\n\nto support the ALJ's determination that claimant did not meet\n\nthis  burden.  Section 1.03 of the listings requires a \"gross\n\nanatomical deformity . . . markedly limiting ability to  walk\n\nand stand.\"   The  ALJ specifically  found that  \"since about\n\nSeptember  1990 the record fails  to show ongoing  use of [a]\n\ncane [to  assist ambulation].\"   In  addition, the ALJ  noted\n\nthat \"[d]uring the hearing  on July 8, 1991 the  claimant was\n\nobserved  to walk  without the  use  of a  cane\" and  that he\n\n\"stood for 10 minutes early in the hearing.\"  \n\n     The medical  evidence,  summarized above,  supports  the\n\nALJ's  finding  that the  injury did  not  meet or  equal the\n\nlisting  criteria.  Claimant was observed to limp a little at\n\nhis  April, 1990 visit to the  SIF and at his September, 1990\n\nvisit  claimant  used  a  cane.    Dr.  Pinero's  June,  1990\n\nexamination of claimant, however,  indicated that he had full\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nrange of motion  in his hip,  although external rotation  was\n\npainful.    In  November,  1990,  Dr.  Torres  reported  that\n\nclaimant  had full range of motion and muscle strength in his\n\nhip  and that  claimant was \"walking  adequately unassisted.\"\n\nIn February, 1991, Dr. Pinero reported that claimant had full\n\nflexion, internal rotation and  abduction.  Finally, on March\n\n20, 1991, an  SIF report  notes that \"no  difficult gait  was\n\nobserved.\"     Claimant's  wrist  injury   cannot,  even   in\n\ncombination with his hip  injury, satisfy the requirements of\n\n   1.03.    Therefore, the  district  judge  did  not err  in\n\naffirming the ALJ's determination that  claimant's impairment\n\ndid not meet or equal a listed impairment.6\n\n     Claimant argues that the ALJ erred in not obtaining  the\n\nassistance  of  a  medical  expert in  order  to  assess  the\n\nseverity of claimant's physical limitations  and whether they\n\nequal  a  listed impairment.    It does  not  require medical\n\nexpertise, however, to determine whether claimant is markedly\n\nlimited in his  ability to walk or stand,  a requirement of  \n\n1.03 of  the listings.   Therefore,  the ALJ  did not err  in\n\nmaking this commonsense judgment  without the assistance of a\n\n                    \n\n6.  Claimant also suggests that his impairments meet or equal\nthe  impairments  listed at  sections  1.04 and  1.12  of the\nAppendix.   Section 1.04, however, requires  arthritis of one\nmajor joint in each  of the upper extremities.   Section 1.12\n                   \nrequires fracture of an  upper extremity where functional use\nis  not restored within twelve months.   The medical evidence\nsupports the  ALJ's conclusion that  these requirements  were\nnot met.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nmedical  expert.   (Cf.

Otherwise they  are not of\n\nsuch  severity  and  frequency  as  to  preclude  substantial\n\ngainful activity.\"   The ALJ considered  claimant's testimony\n\nin light  of the other  record evidence.   Claimant testified\n\nthat  he sometimes experiences  shooting pains extending from\n\nhis  back to  his hip.   He  stated that  he was  taking pain\n\nmedication (\"Dolabid\") two or  three times a day and  that it\n\nsometimes helped.

See Avery  v. Secretary of  Health and\n                                                             \n\nHuman  Services,  797  F.2d  at  23;  SSR  88-13.    The  ALJ\n               \n\nthoroughly  questioned claimant in  accordance with the above\n\nrequirements.  Claimant testified  at his hearing  before the\n\nALJ that he used his right hand for eating, dressing, writing\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nand shaving.  He  further testified that he  sometimes lifted\n\nhis two-year-old  child.   In his application  for disability\n\npayments,   claimant  described   his  daily   activities  as\n\nincluding house cleaning,  taking out the  garbage, shopping,\n\ndoing the dishes, visiting  friends, attending church and the\n\nmovies.   At  his hearing,  however, claimant  testified that\n\ntypically he spent all day watching television.\n\n     The  ALJ specifically found  that claimant's allegations\n\nof  severe and  disabling  pain  were  not  credible.    This\n\ncredibility  determination,  especially  when   supported  by\n\nspecific findings,  is entitled  to deference.   Fustaglia v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir.  1987).   In addition  to  the lack  of supportive\n\nobjective  medical  evidence, the  ALJ  also  found that  the\n\nallegations  were  unsupported  by  claimant's  \"conservative\n\ntreatment, his  demeanor,  his daily  activities,  and  other\n\nevidence of record.\"    The ALJ found claimant's  allegations\n\nof  pain credible  only  to the  extent  that they  \"preclude\n\narduous exertion, repeated  bending, continuous standing  and\n\nwalking.\"   He  therefore  made  the following  determination\n\nregarding claimant's residual functional capacity:\n\n     The claimant has  the residual functional  capacity\n     to perform the  physical exertional requirements of\n     work   except   for   arduous  physical   exertion,\n     repetitive,  bending, lifting or carrying in excess\n     of 20 lbs or continuous standing or sitting.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n     This   conclusion  is  substantially  supported  by  the\n\nmedical evidence  summarized above.   In May,  1990, claimant\n\ntold a treating  physician at the SIF that he  used his wrist\n\nfor activities of  daily living, although  he could not  lift\n\nheavy objects.   A May,  1990 report from  the SIF  indicated\n\nthat  claimant's  grip  strength  and  range  of  motion  had\n\nincreased.  An  x-ray report from 1991 indicated \"no evidence\n\nof  recent  fracture,  soft  tissue  calcifictions  or  other\n\ncomplication\"  in claimant's wrist.  After an  examination of\n\nclaimant on November 14,  1990, Dr. Torres reported  that the\n\npain in his hip was intermittent.   A March, 1991 report from\n\nSIF indicated no edema and no deficit in flexion-extension of\n\nclaimant's  wrist.    A  February, 1991  report  by  treating\n\nphysician  Dr.  Pinero  indicated   that  claimant  had  full\n\nflexion, internal rotation and abduction in his hip,  and 40%\n\nexternal rotation.\n\n     The RFC  form completed  by a nonexamining  physician on\n\nMarch  21, 1991, also supports  the ALJ's findings.   The RFC\n\nreveals that  claimant occasionally can lift  and carry fifty\n\npounds and frequently can  lift and carry twenty-five pounds.\n\nHe  can only  occasionally climb,  balance, kneel  and crawl.\n\nHowever,  he can sit, stand and walk  for up to six hours per\n\nwork  day.   He is  limited in  the weight  that he  can push\n\nand/or pull to ten pounds  because of his wrist injury.   The\n\nRFC also noted  that claimant's gross  manipulation abilities\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwere  limited  somewhat by  his  wrist injury,  but  that his\n\nreaching and fine manipulation abilities were not limited.\n\n     The  vocational expert  testified  that there  were jobs\n\nexisting in significant numbers in the national economy which\n\nclaimant can perform, given his residual functional capacity,\n\nage,  education  and work  experience.    These included  the\n\nfollowing  light to  sedentary  semi-skilled  jobs:  cashier,\n\ncounter clerk, shipping clerk and general office clerk.\n\n     Having reviewed the entire  record, we conclude that the\n\nALJ's  findings  are   supported  by  substantial   evidence,\n\nincluding   medical   evidence   from   claimant's   treating\n\nphysicians, claimant's  testimony at  the hearing before  the\n\nALJ, the RFC  prepared by a  non-examining physician and  the\n\ntestimony of the  vocational expert.  Where  the facts permit\n\ndiverse  inferences, we will affirm the  Secretary so long as\n\nthe   inferences  drawn  are   supported  by   the  evidence.\n\nRodriguez Pagan  v. Secretary  of Health and  Human Services,\n                                                            \n\n819  F.2d 1,3 (1st Cir. 1987).  Therefore, the district court\n\ndid  not   err  in  affirming  the   ALJ's  decision  denying\n\ndisability payments.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons,  the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n</pre>",
