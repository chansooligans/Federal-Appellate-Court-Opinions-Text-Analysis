Toby  Klang   Ward,  a\n                                     \n\nnontenured biology  teacher in the Belmont,  Massachusetts public\n\nschools, sued the  School Committee  of the Town  of Belmont  and\n\nthree members of  the Committee as  individuals for violation  of\n\nher  First Amendment rights  by the  Committee's decision  not to\n\nreappoint her on the basis of a classroom discussion.  Defendants\n\nMary Tinkham, Carol Hickey, and the late Margaret Gibson cast the\n\ndeciding votes against  Ward's reappointment.  Based on  a jury's\n\nanswers to various special  questions, the district court entered\n\njudgment  in  favor   of  defendants,   but  denied   defendants'\n\nsubsequent request for  attorneys' fees.  We  affirm the district\n\ncourt's  judgment, albeit on different grounds.   In addition, we\n\naffirm part of the  attorneys' fees judgment and remand  the rest\n\nfor a  determination  of whether  any  of Ward's  litigation  was\n\nfrivolous.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The dispute arose  out of a discussion in  Ward's ninth\n\ngrade  biology  class  concerning  abortion  of  Down's  Syndrome\n\nfetuses.1  Defendant  Tinkham learned of  this discussion from  a\n\nparent of a student in that class.\n\n          In  June 1982,  the  School Committee  voted on  Ward's\n\nreappointment  for the  1982-83 school  year.   A  favorable vote\n\nwould  have granted Ward  tenure.  By  a deadlocked vote  of 3-3,\n\n                    \n\n1     Some  controversy  also  transpired   over  Ward's  alleged\ndiscussion of  Proposition  2 1/2,  a  Massachusetts  referendum.\nHowever, the jury found  that none of the defendants'  votes were\nmotivated by that  discussion, and  Ward did not  appeal on  that\nissue.  We therefore leave it out of our analysis. \n\n                               -3-\n\nhowever, the School Committee decided to deny reappointment.\n\n          As a result of this decision, Ward sued, alleging:  (1)\n\ndefendants  retaliated  against her  for  discussing  abortion by\n\nvoting against  her  reappointment; (2)  defendants conspired  to\n\ndeny her constitutional rights by deciding not to rehire her; (3)\n\ndefendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment; and  (4) defendants  wrongfully terminated\n\nher in violation of the School Committee's internal policies.  On\n\nNovember 16,  1989, a  magistrate recommended  that the  district\n\ncourt  dismiss Ward's complaint for failure to state a claim, but\n\ngrant  Ward leave  to  amend her  complaint  to include  a  First\n\nAmendment   \"failure-to-forewarn\"  claim.     According   to  the\n\nmagistrate, Ward had  a constitutional right  to notice that  her\n\ndiscussion was prohibited before the School Board could retaliate\n\nagainst  her  for  that discussion.    On  August  31, 1990,  the\n\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate's recommendation, dismissed\n\nthe complaint, and granted the requested leave to amend.\n\n          Subsequently,  Ward filed  a  second amended  complaint\n\nalleging the violation  suggested by the  magistrate.  The  court\n\ndenied defendants' motion to dismiss  with respect to that claim,\n\nbut  granted  it  to the  extent  that  the  complaint alleged  a\n\nviolation  of a  First Amendment  right to  discuss controversial\n\nissues  in a high school  class.  Ward  voluntarily dismissed her\n\nclaim against Gibson after Gibson's death on January 3, 1991.\n\n          Ultimately, the case went to a jury in  two phases.  At\n\nthe end of Phase I, the court  asked the jury for verdicts on six\n\n                               -4-\n\nspecial  questions.2   In response to  the first  five questions,\n\nthe  jury  concluded  that Tinkham  voted  against  reappointment\n\nbecause  of the content of Ward's  classroom statements, and that\n\nHickey and  Gibson  were  not so  motivated.    Inexplicably,  in\n\nresponse to question six, the jury found that all three committee\n\nmembers who voted against reappointment did so based on what they\n\nbelieved  Ward  said  in  her  biology  classroom  without  first\n\ninvestigating  the matter.3  The jury also found that Tinkham and\n\nHickey acted recklessly in this decision.\n\n          Having narrowed the disputed issues to the vote cast by\n\nTinkham,  the  district court  asked  the  jury three  additional\n\nquestions in Phase II.  In response to these questions, the  jury\n\nconcluded that  Tinkham's  views  regarding  abortion  of  Down's\n\nSyndrome  fetuses did not  conflict with  the views  that Tinkham\n\nbelieved Ward espoused.\n\n          Armed  with  the  jury  verdicts,  the  district  court\n\nentered judgment  for defendants.  Specifically,  the court found\n\nfor Hickey because  the disputed discussion did  not motivate her\n\nvote.  The court then relied on Perry Educ. Ass'n  v. Perry Local\n                                                                 \n\nEducators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37  (1983), to conclude that Tinkham's\n                \n\ndisagreement with Ward's views was an essential element of Ward's\n\n                    \n\n2  See the jury's special verdict forms in the appendix.\n\n3  The jury's  response to question six contradicts  its response\nto  the  other questions  regarding  Gibson and  Hickey,  and the\ncontradiction was unexplained on the record.  However, since Ward\ndismissed her claim against  Gibson, and did not appeal  her case\nagainst Hickey, the issue is moot.\n\n                               -5-\n\nFirst Amendment claim.4   Since the  jury found no  disagreement,\n\nthe court  found  for  Tinkham.    As its  members  did  not  act\n\nimproperly, the court ultimately found for the School Committee.\n\n          The court  also  offered alternative  grounds  for  its\n\njudgment.    According  to  the court,  Tinkham  was  entitled to\n\nqualified  immunity,  and Ward  failed  to  establish the  School\n\nCommittee's liability under 42 U.S.C.   1983 (1981).\n\n          After the court announced its decision, Tinkham and the\n\nSchool Committee filed conditional  motions seeking relief in the\n\nevent that this court vacates the district court's judgment.  The\n\nmotions sought  to set  aside the  jury's special  verdicts which\n\nfound  that Tinkham's  vote  was motivated  by the  controversial\n\nclassroom discussion,  and the  verdict which concluded  that the\n\nindividual  defendants  voted  without  investigation  into  what\n\noccurred in  Ward's classroom.  The defendants contended that the\n\nverdicts  contradicted  the  weight  of  the evidence.    In  the\n\nalternative,  they requested a new  trial.  The  court denied the\n\nmotion  to set aside the  jury's special verdicts,  but granted a\n\nconditional new trial due  to the clear weight of  the evidence.5\n\nWard  appeals from the final  judgment and order,  except for the\n\nportion of the judgment relating to Hickey.\n\n          After the court entered  its final judgment, defendants\n\n                    \n\n4   The  district court employed  the wrong legal  standard.  See\n                                                                 \ninfra pp. 12-13.\n     \n\n5  As the  court determined that the investigation  issue related\nonly  to the School Committee's liability,  the court granted the\nnew trial  on that issue  for the School  Committee, but not  for\nTinkham.\n\n                               -6-\n\nfiled a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.    1988.\n\nThe district court  denied the  motion but suggested  that if  we\n\nreverse the fee ruling, we should only grant fees for the portion\n\nof the litigation that occurred after January 3, 1992.  The court\n\nalso  indicated  that  the  fees defendants  requested  for  that\n\nportion were reasonable.   Defendants appeal the denial of  fees,\n\nand Ward cross-appeals,  arguing for a  reduction of the  court's\n\nfee award in its alternative judgment.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.

However, a school committee  violates the\n\nFirst Amendment, applicable to  the states through the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, if it denies rehiring in  retaliation for a nontenured\n\nteacher's exercise of constitutionally  protected speech.

The newspaper did not  constitute a\n         \n\npublic  forum because  the  school never  exhibited that  intent.\n\nIndeed, the Court's  decision that  a school newspaper  is not  a\n\npublic  forum also derived from the fact  that it was part of the\n\njournalism class  curriculum and a  \"regular classroom activity.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\nId. at 268.\n   \n\n          Similarly, a  teacher's statements  in class  during an\n\ninstructional  period are also part of a curriculum and a regular\n\nclass activity.  Like Kuhlmeier's school newspaper, the classroom\n                               \n\nis not a  public forum,  and therefore is  subject to  reasonable\n\nspeech  regulation.    See  Miles,  944  F.2d  at  776  (ordinary\n                                 \n\nclassroom  is not public forum); Bishop v. Aronov, 926 F.2d 1066,\n                                                 \n\n1071 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n          After determining  that the newspaper was  not a public\n\nforum,  the Supreme Court reasoned that because the speech in the\n\nschool newspaper was part of the school curriculum, and therefore\n\nschool-sponsored, the  school was  entitled to more  deference in\n\nspeech  regulation  than  it  would  be  with  respect  to  other\n\n\"personal  expression  that  happens   to  occur  on  the  school\n\npremises.\"   Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 271.  The Court reasoned that\n                      \n\nschools cannot be required to sponsor inappropriate speech.  Id.\n                                                                \n\n          Like  the  newspaper, a  teacher's classroom  speech is\n\npart of the curriculum.   Indeed, a teacher's principal classroom\n\nrole is to teach  students the school curriculum.   Thus, schools\n\nmay  reasonably limit  teachers'  speech in  that  setting.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMiles, 944 F.2d at 776.\n     \n\n          This circuit's test of  teachers' speech regulation, as\n\nset out in Mailloux, is consistent with the Supreme Court's test,\n                   \n\nas set out in  Kuhlmeier.  Cf. Krizek, 713  F.Supp. at 1139.   It\n                                     \n\nstands to reason that whether a  regulation is reasonably related\n\nto legitimate  pedagogical concerns  will depend on,  among other\n\n                               -10-\n\nthings,  the   age  and  sophistication  of   the  students,  the\n\nrelationship  between  teaching  method  and   valid  educational\n\nobjective, and the context and manner of the presentation.\n\n          Even  if under the above  test a school  may prohibit a\n\nteacher's  statements before she  makes them, however,  it is not\n\nentitled to  retaliate against  speech that it  never prohibited.\n\nCf. Mount Healthy City Bd.  of Educ., 429 U.S. at  284 (classroom\n                                    \n\nspeech was  constitutionally protected when school  board did not\n\nsuggest that teacher violated any established policy, or that the\n\nboard's reaction to the communication was \"anything more than  an\n\nad hoc response  to [plaintiff's] communication .  . . .\").   Few\n\nsubjects lack controversy.  If teachers must fear retaliation for\n\nevery utterance, they will  fear teaching.  As the  Supreme Court\n\nwarned  in Keyishian  385  U.S. at  604,  \"[t]he danger  of  that\n                    \n\nchilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights\n\nmust be guarded against  by sensitive tools which  clearly inform\n\nteachers what is being proscribed.\"\n\n          Although  the Court  in Kuhlmeier  did not  address the\n                                           \n\nnotice issue  with respect to school-sponsored  speech, it stated\n\nonly that prepublication control need  not be pursuant to express\n                                \n\nregulation.  Kuhlmeier,  484 U.S. at 273 n.6.  This suggests that\n                      \n\nthe  Court  would  agree that  postpublication  retaliation  must\n                                                           \n\nderive from some prior limitation.  Indeed, this circuit has long\n\nrecognized a  teacher's right to notice of what classroom conduct\n\nis prohibited.  See, e.g.,  Mailloux, 448 F.2d at 1243; Keefe  v.\n                                                             \n\nGeanakos, 418 F.2d 359, 362 (1st Cir. 1969).\n        \n\n                               -11-\n\n          Of course, while we acknowledge a First Amendment right\n\nof  public school teachers to know what conduct is proscribed, we\n\ndo  not  hold  that  a  school  must  expressly   prohibit  every\n\nimaginable inappropriate conduct by teachers.  Cf. Krizek, 713 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp. at 1140 (warning that such requirement is an impossible and\n\nundesirable burden).  The relevant inquiry is:  based on existing\n\nregulations,   policies,  discussions,   and   other   forms   of\n\ncommunication between school administration  and teachers, was it\n\nreasonable for the school to expect the teacher to know  that her\n\nconduct was prohibited?\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT'S ANALYSIS\n\n          The district court found  that under Perry Educ. Ass'n,\n                                                                \n\nthe School Committee's  retaliation was permissible as long as it\n\ndid  not  suppress  Ward's  speech  based  on the  viewpoint  she\n\nexpressed.    In  Perry Educ.  Ass'n,  pursuant  to  a collective\n                                    \n\nbargaining agreement, a school  permitted a teachers' association\n\nto  use   the  interschool  mailing  system   and  the  teachers'\n\nmailboxes.   Under the  same agreement,  the school  permitted no\n\naccess by rival teachers' associations.  A rival association sued\n\nalleging  a First Amendment violation.  The Supreme Court in that\n\ncase  held that the preferential access did not violate the First\n\nAmendment.  Perry  Educ. Ass'n,  460 U.S.  at 44-54.   The  court\n                              \n\nreasoned  that  a  state  may  reserve  public property  for  its\n\nintended use.  However,  it may regulate speech on  that property\n\nonly  if  the  regulation is  reasonable  and  not  an effort  to\n\nsuppress expression due to the view expressed.  Id. at 46.\n                                                   \n\n                               -12-\n\n          Under the  Kuhlmeier rationale, Perry Educ.  Ass'n does\n                                                            \n\nnot  apply to  teachers'  classroom speech.    A faculty  mailing\n\nsystem significantly  differs from a  school-sponsored curriculum\n\nbeing taught to a  captive audience of youngsters.   Schools need\n\nnot fear that  speech on  a faculty mailing  system will  prevent\n\nstudents  from learning  appropriate classroom lessons.   Indeed,\n\nwhile  citing Perry Educ. Ass'n,  the Court in  Kuhlmeier did not\n                                                         \n\nrequire  that school  regulation  of  school-sponsored speech  be\n\nviewpoint neutral.  See Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 270.\n                                 \n\n          Moreover,  Perry Educ.  Ass'n  does not  stand for  the\n                                       \n\nproposition that where a state reserves property for its intended\n\nuse, regulation of speech on that property is permissible as long\n\nas  it is  viewpoint  neutral.   Even  under Perry  Educ.  Ass'n,\n                                                                \n\nviewpoint discrimination is not an  essential element of a  First\n\nAmendment claim.  The  Court in that case specifically  held that\n\nthe regulation also must  be reasonable.  Perry Educ.  Ass'n, 460\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  46.  Thus, even if a regulation is viewpoint neutral, it\n\ncan be impermissible under Perry Educ. Ass'n.\n                                            \n\nIII. APPLICATION TO THE PRESENT CASE\n\n          On  appeal,  Ward  does   not  argue  that  the  School\n\nCommittee  was not  entitled  to limit  her  statements had  they\n\nchosen  to do  so in advance.   She  argues only  that the School\n\nCommittee failed to notify her  that her conduct was  prohibited.\n\nSince the  trial jury never determined whether Ward received such\n\nnotice, she requests a trial on that issue.  We  find that she is\n\nnot entitled to one.\n\n                               -13-\n\n          Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  states\n\nthat  without objecting  before the  jury retires,  no party  may\n\nlater complain of a failure  to give an instruction.6  This  rule\n\nequally applies to special  interrogatories.  Phav. v. Trueblood,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  915  F.2d 764,  769 (1st  Cir.  1990) (citing  Anderson v.\n                                                              \n\nCryovac, 862 F.2d 910, 918 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n       \n\n          In  the present  case, Ward  never requested  a special\n\ninterrogatory on  the  issue of  notice.   Moreover,  while  Ward\n\nessentially  argues that  she  had no  meaningful opportunity  to\n\nrequest such a  question, we find  otherwise.  Before  submitting\n\nthe Phase I special verdict form to  the jury, the district court\n\njudge  held a  conference  in which  he specifically  invited the\n\nparties' suggestions.  (Conference  on Verdict Form at 4).   Ward\n\nfailed  to  request  an  interrogatory on  notice  at  that time.\n\nAdditionally,  Ward failed to mention the notice issue in both of\n\nher  submissions of proposed changes to the Phase I verdict form.\n\nAfter considering  the court's proposed verdict  form, Ward moved\n\nfor  additional interrogatories to the jury.  Again, Ward made no\n\nrequest for a  question on  the notice issue.   Similarly,  while\n\ndefendants'  counsel  inquired  about  the  notice  issue  before\n\nsubmitting the Phase  II verdict form to  the jury, Ward  did not\n\n                    \n\n6  Rule 51 provides in relevant part:\n\n            No party may  assign as error the  giving\n            or the  failure  to give  an  instruction\n            unless that party objects  thereto before\n            the jury retires to consider its verdict,\n            stating distinctly the matter objected to\n            and the grounds of the objection.\n\n                               -14-\n\nrequest a question  on the  matter.  In  response to  defendants'\n\ninquiry, the court stated that it would not address that issue in\n\nPhase  II, and would address any further issues in future phases.\n\nAfter the jury answered the Phase II questions, Ward again missed\n\nher chance  to  request an  interrogatory  on the  notice  issue.\n\nIndeed, after  Phase II, Ward specifically argued to the district\n\ncourt that  \"it's not necessary to  have a phase  that deals with\n\nthe question of  notice.\"  (Hearing on Motions, July  7, 1992, at\n\n22).  Instead, Ward asked the court to find a lack of notice as a\n\nmatter of law, which the court  refused to do.  It was not  until\n\nsix days after  the court's entry of  a final judgment that  Ward\n\nfinally  requested  a  jury finding  on  the  notice  issue.   We\n\nconclude that although Ward had numerous opportunities to request\n\na  jury determination  on the  principal issue  of her  case, she\n\nfailed to  do so.   She  therefore has waived  the right  to that\n\ndetermination, and has not made her case against defendants.\n\nIV.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          Under  42 U.S.C.   1988  (Supp. 1992), a  court, in its\n\ndiscretion,  may award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in a\n\ncivil rights case.7   A  prevailing defendant in  a civil  rights\n\n                    \n\n7  Section 1988 provides in relevant part:\n\n            In any action or proceeding to enforce  a\n            provision of sections  1981, 1982,  1983,\n            1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of\n            Public  Law  92-318, or  title VI  of the\n            Civil Rights Act of  1964, the court,  in\n            its discretion, may allow  the prevailing\n            party,  other than  the United  States, a\n            reasonable attorney's fee as part  of the\n            costs.\n\n                               -15-\n\ncase may recover attorneys' fees if it can show that \"plaintiff's\n\naction was  frivolous, unreasonable,  or groundless, or  that the\n\nplaintiff  continued to  litigate  after it  clearly became  so.\"\n\nFoster v. Mydas  Assocs., Inc.,  943 F.2d 139,  145-46 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1991) (quoting Christianburg Garment Co.  v. EEOC, 434 U.S.  412,\n                                                 \n\n422 (1978)).\n\n          The   district  court   denied   attorneys'   fees   by\n\nanalogizing  to the  interrelated  claims  doctrine discussed  in\n\nLipsett v.  Blanco, 975  F.2d 934  (1st  Cir.  1992).   Under the\n                  \n\ndoctrine, once a court decides that a party has prevailed for the\n\npurposes of  a fee-shifting  statute, the  fee award  may include\n\nfees for  work performed on  unsuccessful claims if  that party's\n\nunsuccessful claims are interrelated  to the successful claims by\n\na common core of facts or related legal theories.  Id. at 940-41.\n                                                      \n\n          In  the present  case,  the district  court found  that\n\nwhile some of  Ward's legal theories  might have been  frivolous,\n\nsome of the claims were permissible.  The court also found all of\n\nWard's  claims   interrelated.     Thus,   analogizing   to   the\n\ninterrelated  claims doctrine,  the court denied  fees on  all of\n\nWard's claims.\n\n          We   find  the   district  court's   reliance   on  the\n\ninterrelated claims  doctrine misplaced.   That doctrine  is used\n\nfor convenience in the  difficult task of calculating fees.   See\n                                                                 \n\nid.   It  is inapplicable  unless the  court initially  finds the\n   \n\nplaintiff a prevailing party.   A court may not use the  doctrine\n\nto decide not to grant any fees.\n\n                               -16-\n\n          The standard  for a  civil rights defendant  to receive\n\nfees  is high to encourage  legitimate civil rights  claims.  See\n                                                                 \n\nFoster v.  Mydas Assoc.,  Inc., 943  F.2d at 144.   On  the other\n                              \n\nhand, frivolous civil rights claims waste judicial resources that\n\nwould  otherwise  be  used  for  legitimate  claims.     See  id.\n                                                                 \n\nAccordingly, a  district court should not deny fees for defending\n\nfrivolous claims merely because  calculation would be  difficult.\n\nWe therefore  refuse to  adopt the district  court's primary  fee\n\njudgment.\n\n          In addition  to denying fees, the  district court ruled\n\nin the alternative that  \"even if persuaded\" that some  of Ward's\n\nclaims were frivolous, the litigation that took place  before the\n\ncourt's order of January  3, 1992 was not frivolous, and that the\n\nrequested  fees   for  the  litigation  beyond   that  time  were\n\nreasonable.   Given the muddled state of the law surrounding this\n\ncase,  we  find  that  the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its\n\ndiscretion  in  finding  that  Ward's  claims  were  not  clearly\n\nfrivolous before January  3, 1992.   Thus, we  adopt the  court's\n\nruling to the extent that it  denies fees for the litigation that\n\noccurred before that time.\n\n          However, in  its alternative ruling, the district court\n\nnever determined whether any  of Ward's litigation that continued\n\nbeyond that time was frivolous.  We  ask  the  district court  on\n\nremand  to  make  that  determination,  and  calculate  any  fees\n\naccordingly.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                               -17-\n\n          We affirm the district  court's judgment for defendants\n                   \n\non the merits.  We also affirm the district court's alternate fee\n                              \n\nruling to the extent that it denies fees for the litigation prior\n\nto  January 3, 1992.   However, we remand  for a determination of\n                                         \n\nwhich,  if any, of Ward's  litigation beyond January  3, 1992 was\n\nfrivolous.  If there  was any frivolous litigation, the  district\n\ncourt should award fees to defendants accordingly.\n\n                               -18-\n",

Toby  Klang   Ward,  a\n                                     \n\nnontenured biology  teacher in the Belmont,  Massachusetts public\n\nschools, sued the  School Committee  of the Town  of Belmont  and\n\nthree members of  the Committee as  individuals for violation  of\n\nher  First Amendment rights  by the  Committee's decision  not to\n\nreappoint her on the basis of a classroom discussion.  Defendants\n\nMary Tinkham, Carol Hickey, and the late Margaret Gibson cast the\n\ndeciding votes against  Ward's reappointment.  Based on  a jury's\n\nanswers to various special  questions, the district court entered\n\njudgment  in  favor   of  defendants,   but  denied   defendants'\n\nsubsequent request for  attorneys' fees.  We  affirm the district\n\ncourt's  judgment, albeit on different grounds.   In addition, we\n\naffirm part of the  attorneys' fees judgment and remand  the rest\n\nfor a  determination  of whether  any  of Ward's  litigation  was\n\nfrivolous.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The dispute arose  out of a discussion in  Ward's ninth\n\ngrade  biology  class  concerning  abortion  of  Down's  Syndrome\n\nfetuses.1  Defendant  Tinkham learned of  this discussion from  a\n\nparent of a student in that class.\n\n          In  June 1982,  the  School Committee  voted on  Ward's\n\nreappointment  for the  1982-83 school  year.   A  favorable vote\n\nwould  have granted Ward  tenure.  By  a deadlocked vote  of 3-3,\n\n                    \n\n1     Some  controversy  also  transpired   over  Ward's  alleged\ndiscussion of  Proposition  2 1/2,  a  Massachusetts  referendum.\nHowever, the jury found  that none of the defendants'  votes were\nmotivated by that  discussion, and  Ward did not  appeal on  that\nissue.  We therefore leave it out of our analysis. \n\n                               -3-\n\nhowever, the School Committee decided to deny reappointment.\n\n          As a result of this decision, Ward sued, alleging:  (1)\n\ndefendants  retaliated  against her  for  discussing  abortion by\n\nvoting against  her  reappointment; (2)  defendants conspired  to\n\ndeny her constitutional rights by deciding not to rehire her; (3)\n\ndefendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment; and  (4) defendants  wrongfully terminated\n\nher in violation of the School Committee's internal policies.  On\n\nNovember 16,  1989, a  magistrate recommended  that the  district\n\ncourt  dismiss Ward's complaint for failure to state a claim, but\n\ngrant  Ward leave  to  amend her  complaint  to include  a  First\n\nAmendment   \"failure-to-forewarn\"  claim.     According   to  the\n\nmagistrate, Ward had  a constitutional right  to notice that  her\n\ndiscussion was prohibited before the School Board could retaliate\n\nagainst  her  for  that discussion.    On  August  31, 1990,  the\n\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate's recommendation, dismissed\n\nthe complaint, and granted the requested leave to amend.\n\n          Subsequently,  Ward filed  a  second amended  complaint\n\nalleging the violation  suggested by the  magistrate.  The  court\n\ndenied defendants' motion to dismiss  with respect to that claim,\n\nbut  granted  it  to the  extent  that  the  complaint alleged  a\n\nviolation  of a  First Amendment  right to  discuss controversial\n\nissues  in a high school  class.  Ward  voluntarily dismissed her\n\nclaim against Gibson after Gibson's death on January 3, 1991.\n\n          Ultimately, the case went to a jury in  two phases.  At\n\nthe end of Phase I, the court  asked the jury for verdicts on six\n\n                               -4-\n\nspecial  questions.2   In response to  the first  five questions,\n\nthe  jury  concluded  that Tinkham  voted  against  reappointment\n\nbecause  of the content of Ward's  classroom statements, and that\n\nHickey and  Gibson  were  not so  motivated.    Inexplicably,  in\n\nresponse to question six, the jury found that all three committee\n\nmembers who voted against reappointment did so based on what they\n\nbelieved  Ward  said  in  her  biology  classroom  without  first\n\ninvestigating  the matter.3  The jury also found that Tinkham and\n\nHickey acted recklessly in this decision.\n\n          Having narrowed the disputed issues to the vote cast by\n\nTinkham,  the  district court  asked  the  jury three  additional\n\nquestions in Phase II.  In response to these questions, the  jury\n\nconcluded that  Tinkham's  views  regarding  abortion  of  Down's\n\nSyndrome  fetuses did not  conflict with  the views  that Tinkham\n\nbelieved Ward espoused.\n\n          Armed  with  the  jury  verdicts,  the  district  court\n\nentered judgment  for defendants.  Specifically,  the court found\n\nfor Hickey because  the disputed discussion did  not motivate her\n\nvote.  The court then relied on Perry Educ. Ass'n  v. Perry Local\n                                                                 \n\nEducators' Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110874\"><a href=\"/opinion/110874/perry-ed-assn-v-perry-local-educators-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1983), to conclude that Tinkham's\n                \n\ndisagreement with Ward's views was an essential element of Ward's\n\n                    \n\n2  See the jury's special verdict forms in the appendix.\n\n3  The jury's  response to question six contradicts  its response\nto  the  other questions  regarding  Gibson and  Hickey,  and the\ncontradiction was unexplained on the record.  However, since Ward\ndismissed her claim against  Gibson, and did not appeal  her case\nagainst Hickey, the issue is moot.\n\n                               -5-\n\nFirst Amendment claim.4   Since the  jury found no  disagreement,\n\nthe court  found  for  Tinkham.    As its  members  did  not  act\n\nimproperly, the court ultimately found for the School Committee.\n\n          The court  also  offered alternative  grounds  for  its\n\njudgment.    According  to  the court,  Tinkham  was  entitled to\n\nqualified  immunity,  and Ward  failed  to  establish the  School\n\nCommittee's liability under 42 U.S.C.   1983 (1981).\n\n          After the court announced its decision, Tinkham and the\n\nSchool Committee filed conditional  motions seeking relief in the\n\nevent that this court vacates the district court's judgment.  The\n\nmotions sought  to set  aside the  jury's special  verdicts which\n\nfound  that Tinkham's  vote  was motivated  by the  controversial\n\nclassroom discussion,  and the  verdict which concluded  that the\n\nindividual  defendants  voted  without  investigation  into  what\n\noccurred in  Ward's classroom.  The defendants contended that the\n\nverdicts  contradicted  the  weight  of  the evidence.    In  the\n\nalternative,  they requested a new  trial.  The  court denied the\n\nmotion  to set aside the  jury's special verdicts,  but granted a\n\nconditional new trial due  to the clear weight of  the evidence.5\n\nWard  appeals from the final  judgment and order,  except for the\n\nportion of the judgment relating to Hickey.\n\n          After the court entered  its final judgment, defendants\n\n                    \n\n4   The  district court employed  the wrong legal  standard.  See\n                                                                 \ninfra pp. 12-13.\n     \n\n5  As the  court determined that the investigation  issue related\nonly  to the School Committee's liability,  the court granted the\nnew trial  on that issue  for the School  Committee, but not  for\nTinkham.\n\n                               -6-\n\nfiled a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.    1988.\n\nThe district court  denied the  motion but suggested  that if  we\n\nreverse the fee ruling, we should only grant fees for the portion\n\nof the litigation that occurred after January 3, 1992.  The court\n\nalso  indicated  that  the  fees defendants  requested  for  that\n\nportion were reasonable.   Defendants appeal the denial of  fees,\n\nand Ward cross-appeals,  arguing for a  reduction of the  court's\n\nfee award in its alternative judgment.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.

See\n                                                                 \n\nMiles, 944 F.2d at 775-79; cf. Krizek, 713 F. Supp. at 1139.\n                                     \n\n          In  Kuhlmeier,  a school  principal  prevented students\n                       \n\nfrom  printing  certain articles  in  a  school  newspaper.   The\n\nstudents participated in the production  of the newspaper as part\n\nof a journalism  class.  The Court found that  because the school\n\nnewspaper  was  not  a  public forum,  the  school  could  impose\n\nreasonable   restrictions  of   expression  through   the  paper.\n\nKuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at  260.  The newspaper did not  constitute a\n         \n\npublic  forum because  the  school never  exhibited that  intent.\n\nIndeed, the Court's  decision that  a school newspaper  is not  a\n\npublic  forum also derived from the fact  that it was part of the\n\njournalism class  curriculum and a  \"regular classroom activity.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\nId. at 268.\n   \n\n          Similarly, a  teacher's statements  in class  during an\n\ninstructional  period are also part of a curriculum and a regular\n\nclass activity.  Like Kuhlmeier's school newspaper, the classroom\n                               \n\nis not a  public forum,  and therefore is  subject to  reasonable\n\nspeech  regulation.    See  Miles,  944  F.2d  at  776  (ordinary\n                                 \n\nclassroom  is not public forum); Bishop v. Aronov, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556562\"><a href=\"/opinion/556562/phillip-a-bishop-v-aaron-m-aronov-winton-m-blount-oh-delchamps/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                 \n\n1071 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n          After determining  that the newspaper was  not a public\n\nforum,  the Supreme Court reasoned that because the speech in the\n\nschool newspaper was part of the school curriculum, and therefore\n\nschool-sponsored, the  school was  entitled to more  deference in\n\nspeech  regulation  than  it  would  be  with  respect  to  other\n\n\"personal  expression  that  happens   to  occur  on  the  school\n\npremises.\"   Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 271.  The Court reasoned that\n                      \n\nschools cannot be required to sponsor inappropriate speech.  Id.\n                                                                \n\n          Like  the  newspaper, a  teacher's classroom  speech is\n\npart of the curriculum.   Indeed, a teacher's principal classroom\n\nrole is to teach  students the school curriculum.   Thus, schools\n\nmay  reasonably limit  teachers'  speech in  that  setting.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMiles, 944 F.2d at 776.\n     \n\n          This circuit's test of  teachers' speech regulation, as\n\nset out in Mailloux, is consistent with the Supreme Court's test,\n                   \n\nas set out in  Kuhlmeier.  Cf. Krizek, 713  F.Supp. at 1139.   It\n                                     \n\nstands to reason that whether a  regulation is reasonably related\n\nto legitimate  pedagogical concerns  will depend on,  among other\n\n                               -10-\n\nthings,  the   age  and  sophistication  of   the  students,  the\n\nrelationship  between  teaching  method  and   valid  educational\n\nobjective, and the context and manner of the presentation.\n\n          Even  if under the above  test a school  may prohibit a\n\nteacher's  statements before she  makes them, however,  it is not\n\nentitled to  retaliate against  speech that it  never prohibited.\n\nCf. Mount Healthy City Bd.  of Educ., 429 U.S. at  284 (classroom\n                                    \n\nspeech was  constitutionally protected when school  board did not\n\nsuggest that teacher violated any established policy, or that the\n\nboard's reaction to the communication was \"anything more than  an\n\nad hoc response  to [plaintiff's] communication .  . . .\").   Few\n\nsubjects lack controversy.  If teachers must fear retaliation for\n\nevery utterance, they will  fear teaching.  As the  Supreme Court\n\nwarned  in Keyishian  385  U.S. at  604,  \"[t]he danger  of  that\n                    \n\nchilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights\n\nmust be guarded against  by sensitive tools which  clearly inform\n\nteachers what is being proscribed.\"\n\n          Although  the Court  in Kuhlmeier  did not  address the\n                                           \n\nnotice issue  with respect to school-sponsored  speech, it stated\n\nonly that prepublication control need  not be pursuant to express\n                                \n\nregulation.  Kuhlmeier,  484 U.S. at 273 n.6.  This suggests that\n                      \n\nthe  Court  would  agree that  postpublication  retaliation  must\n                                                           \n\nderive from some prior limitation.  Indeed, this circuit has long\n\nrecognized a  teacher's right to notice of what classroom conduct\n\nis prohibited.  See, e.g.,  Mailloux, 448 F.2d at 1243; Keefe  v.\n                                                             \n\nGeanakos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"287268\"><a href=\"/opinion/287268/robert-j-keefe-v-george-j-geanakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362 (1st Cir. 1969).\n        \n\n                               -11-\n\n          Of course, while we acknowledge a First Amendment right\n\nof  public school teachers to know what conduct is proscribed, we\n\ndo  not  hold  that  a  school  must  expressly   prohibit  every\n\nimaginable inappropriate conduct by teachers.  Cf. Krizek, 713 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp. at 1140 (warning that such requirement is an impossible and\n\nundesirable burden).  The relevant inquiry is:  based on existing\n\nregulations,   policies,  discussions,   and   other   forms   of\n\ncommunication between school administration  and teachers, was it\n\nreasonable for the school to expect the teacher to know  that her\n\nconduct was prohibited?\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT'S ANALYSIS\n\n          The district court found  that under Perry Educ. Ass'n,\n                                                                \n\nthe School Committee's  retaliation was permissible as long as it\n\ndid  not  suppress  Ward's  speech  based  on the  viewpoint  she\n\nexpressed.    In  Perry Educ.  Ass'n,  pursuant  to  a collective\n                                    \n\nbargaining agreement, a school  permitted a teachers' association\n\nto  use   the  interschool  mailing  system   and  the  teachers'\n\nmailboxes.   Under the  same agreement,  the school  permitted no\n\naccess by rival teachers' associations.  A rival association sued\n\nalleging  a First Amendment violation.  The Supreme Court in that\n\ncase  held that the preferential access did not violate the First\n\nAmendment.  Perry  Educ. Ass'n,  460 U.S.  at 44-54.   The  court\n                              \n\nreasoned  that  a  state  may  reserve  public property  for  its\n\nintended use.  However,  it may regulate speech on  that property\n\nonly  if  the  regulation is  reasonable  and  not  an effort  to\n\nsuppress expression due to the view expressed.  Id. at 46.\n                                                   \n\n                               -12-\n\n          Under the  Kuhlmeier rationale, Perry Educ.  Ass'n does\n                                                            \n\nnot  apply to  teachers'  classroom speech.    A faculty  mailing\n\nsystem significantly  differs from a  school-sponsored curriculum\n\nbeing taught to a  captive audience of youngsters.   Schools need\n\nnot fear that  speech on  a faculty mailing  system will  prevent\n\nstudents  from learning  appropriate classroom lessons.   Indeed,\n\nwhile  citing Perry Educ. Ass'n,  the Court in  Kuhlmeier did not\n                                                         \n\nrequire  that school  regulation  of  school-sponsored speech  be\n\nviewpoint neutral.  See Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 270.\n                                 \n\n          Moreover,  Perry Educ.  Ass'n  does not  stand for  the\n                                       \n\nproposition that where a state reserves property for its intended\n\nuse, regulation of speech on that property is permissible as long\n\nas  it is  viewpoint  neutral.   Even  under Perry  Educ.  Ass'n,\n                                                                \n\nviewpoint discrimination is not an  essential element of a  First\n\nAmendment claim.  The  Court in that case specifically  held that\n\nthe regulation also must  be reasonable.  Perry Educ.  Ass'n, 460\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  46.  Thus, even if a regulation is viewpoint neutral, it\n\ncan be impermissible under Perry Educ. Ass'n.\n                                            \n\nIII. APPLICATION TO THE PRESENT CASE\n\n          On  appeal,  Ward  does   not  argue  that  the  School\n\nCommittee  was not  entitled  to limit  her  statements had  they\n\nchosen  to do  so in advance.   She  argues only  that the School\n\nCommittee failed to notify her  that her conduct was  prohibited.\n\nSince the  trial jury never determined whether Ward received such\n\nnotice, she requests a trial on that issue.  We  find that she is\n\nnot entitled to one.\n\n                               -13-\n\n          Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  states\n\nthat  without objecting  before the  jury retires,  no party  may\n\nlater complain of a failure  to give an instruction.6  This  rule\n\nequally applies to special  interrogatories.  Phav. v. Trueblood,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  769 (1st  Cir.  1990) (citing  Anderson v.\n                                                              \n\nCryovac, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n       \n\n          In  the present  case, Ward  never requested  a special\n\ninterrogatory on  the  issue of  notice.   Moreover,  while  Ward\n\nessentially  argues that  she  had no  meaningful opportunity  to\n\nrequest such a  question, we find  otherwise.  Before  submitting\n\nthe Phase I special verdict form to  the jury, the district court\n\njudge  held a  conference  in which  he specifically  invited the\n\nparties' suggestions.  (Conference  on Verdict Form at 4).   Ward\n\nfailed  to  request  an  interrogatory on  notice  at  that time.\n\nAdditionally,  Ward failed to mention the notice issue in both of\n\nher  submissions of proposed changes to the Phase I verdict form.\n\nAfter considering  the court's proposed verdict  form, Ward moved\n\nfor  additional interrogatories to the jury.  Again, Ward made no\n\nrequest for a  question on  the notice issue.   Similarly,  while\n\ndefendants'  counsel  inquired  about  the  notice  issue  before\n\nsubmitting the Phase  II verdict form to  the jury, Ward  did not\n\n                    \n\n6  Rule 51 provides in relevant part:\n\n            No party may  assign as error the  giving\n            or the  failure  to give  an  instruction\n            unless that party objects  thereto before\n            the jury retires to consider its verdict,\n            stating distinctly the matter objected to\n            and the grounds of the objection.\n\n                               -14-\n\nrequest a question  on the  matter.  In  response to  defendants'\n\ninquiry, the court stated that it would not address that issue in\n\nPhase  II, and would address any further issues in future phases.\n\nAfter the jury answered the Phase II questions, Ward again missed\n\nher chance  to  request an  interrogatory  on the  notice  issue.\n\nIndeed, after  Phase II, Ward specifically argued to the district\n\ncourt that  \"it's not necessary to  have a phase  that deals with\n\nthe question of  notice.\"  (Hearing on Motions, July  7, 1992, at\n\n22).  Instead, Ward asked the court to find a lack of notice as a\n\nmatter of law, which the court  refused to do.  It was not  until\n\nsix days after  the court's entry of  a final judgment that  Ward\n\nfinally  requested  a  jury finding  on  the  notice  issue.   We\n\nconclude that although Ward had numerous opportunities to request\n\na  jury determination  on the  principal issue  of her  case, she\n\nfailed to  do so.   She  therefore has waived  the right  to that\n\ndetermination, and has not made her case against defendants.\n\nIV.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          Under  42 U.S.C.   1988  (Supp. 1992), a  court, in its\n\ndiscretion,  may award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in a\n\ncivil rights case.7   A  prevailing defendant in  a civil  rights\n\n                    \n\n7  Section 1988 provides in relevant part:\n\n            In any action or proceeding to enforce  a\n            provision of sections  1981, 1982,  1983,\n            1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of\n            Public  Law  92-318, or  title VI  of the\n            Civil Rights Act of  1964, the court,  in\n            its discretion, may allow  the prevailing\n            party,  other than  the United  States, a\n            reasonable attorney's fee as part  of the\n            costs.\n\n                               -15-\n\ncase may recover attorneys' fees if it can show that \"plaintiff's\n\naction was  frivolous, unreasonable,  or groundless, or  that the\n\nplaintiff  continued to  litigate  after it  clearly became  so.\"\n\nFoster v.

The court also found all of\n\nWard's  claims   interrelated.     Thus,   analogizing   to   the\n\ninterrelated  claims doctrine,  the court denied  fees on  all of\n\nWard's claims.\n\n          We   find  the   district  court's   reliance   on  the\n\ninterrelated claims  doctrine misplaced.   That doctrine  is used\n\nfor convenience in the  difficult task of calculating fees.   See\n                                                                 \n\nid.

See  id.\n                                                                 \n\nAccordingly, a  district court should not deny fees for defending\n\nfrivolous claims merely because  calculation would be  difficult.\n\nWe therefore  refuse to  adopt the district  court's primary  fee\n\njudgment.\n\n          In addition  to denying fees, the  district court ruled\n\nin the alternative that  \"even if persuaded\" that some  of Ward's\n\nclaims were frivolous, the litigation that took place  before the\n\ncourt's order of January  3, 1992 was not frivolous, and that the\n\nrequested  fees   for  the  litigation  beyond   that  time  were\n\nreasonable.   Given the muddled state of the law surrounding this\n\ncase,  we  find  that  the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its\n\ndiscretion  in  finding  that  Ward's  claims  were  not  clearly\n\nfrivolous before January  3, 1992.   Thus, we  adopt the  court's\n\nruling to the extent that it  denies fees for the litigation that\n\noccurred before that time.\n\n          However, in  its alternative ruling, the district court\n\nnever determined whether any  of Ward's litigation that continued\n\nbeyond that time was frivolous.  We  ask  the  district court  on\n\nremand  to  make  that  determination,  and  calculate  any  fees\n\naccordingly.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                               -17-\n\n          We affirm the district  court's judgment for defendants\n                   \n\non the merits.  We also affirm the district court's alternate fee\n                              \n\nruling to the extent that it denies fees for the litigation prior\n\nto  January 3, 1992.   However, we remand  for a determination of\n                                         \n\nwhich,  if any, of Ward's  litigation beyond January  3, 1992 was\n\nfrivolous.  If there  was any frivolous litigation, the  district\n\ncourt should award fees to defendants accordingly.\n\n                               -18-\n</pre>",
