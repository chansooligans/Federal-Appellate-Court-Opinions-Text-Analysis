Vega-Pacheco,  Assistant United  States Attorney,\n                            \nwith whom  Daniel F. L pez-Romo,  United States Attorney,  was on\n                               \nbrief for appellee.\n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n          Per Curiam.  In  these appeals, which arise out  of the\n                    \n\nsame facts, one  appellant challenges his sentence  and the other\n\nchallenges his guilty  plea.   Both challenges arise  out of  the\n\nsame count in  the common indictment: conspiracy to distribute at\n\nleast  five kilograms of cocaine.   Because we  find both appeals\n\nmeritless,  we affirm.    We discuss  our  reasoning as  to  each\n\nappellant individually.\n\n                  APPELLANT DOMINGO COTTO-GARCIA\n                                                \n\n          Appellant Cotto presents  us with a curious  claim.  On\n\nthe one hand, he asserts that he entered his plea voluntarily and\n\nknowingly  as to all counts, including the count of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute  at least  five kilograms  of cocaine.   On  the other\n\nhand, he maintains that he did not know his plea  would result in\n\na  sentence based  on a  conspiracy to  distribute at  least five\n\nkilograms.   He contends,  therefore, that  he  should have  been\n\nsentenced in accordance  with the amount  of cocaine he  actually\n\nhandled.   Appellant  essentially wishes  us  to leave  the  plea\n\nagreement  intact,  but  remand  the  case  for  resentencing  in\n\naccordance with a lower amount of cocaine.  We   cannot   do   as\n\nappellant wishes.  \n\n          Appellant specifically pled guilty  to a conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute five  kilograms of  cocaine, and expressly  refused to\n\nseek  withdrawal  of  that  plea  at  oral   argument.    Indeed,\n\nappellant's attorney plainly and repeatedly asserted the validity\n\nof  that plea.   Thus, we are limited  to determining whether the\n\nsentence  imposed pursuant  to that  plea was  improper.   As the\n\n                               -3-\n\nsentence fell  within the  applicable Sentencing  Guideline range\n\nfor appellant's crime, we conclude that it was entirely proper.\n\n                   APPELLANT JOSE QUINO ES-PITA\n                                               \n\n          In  contrast to  appellant  Cotto,  appellant  Qui ones\n\nseeks to withdraw his plea  as unknowing.  He claims that  at the\n\nsentencing hearing,  he wished  to present evidence  negating the\n\nfactual  basis  for  the  plea.    Specifically,  he  sought  the\n\ntestimony  of appellant Cotto  to the effect  that the conspiracy\n\ndid  not  involve  five  kilograms.   Appellant  Cotto,  however,\n\ninvoked  his constitutional  right against  self-incrimination on\n\nadvice  of counsel,  and  the district  court  refused to  compel\n\nCotto's  testimony.   Appellant  claims that  the district  court\n\nerred in doing so.  We find no error.\n\n          Cotto's  right  to  claim  the  Fifth  Amendment  right\n\nagainst self-incrimination  cannot be trampled upon  in appellant\n\nQui ones'  attempt to gain useful evidence.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nZirpolo,  704 F.2d 23, 25-26  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 464 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n822 (1983);  United States v. Rodr guez, 706 F.2d 31, 36 (2d Cir.\n                                       \n\n1983).  The fact that Cotto already pled guilty to the conspiracy\n\ncharge did  not preclude him from claiming  the right.  The Fifth\n\nAmendment  does not  require that  defendants face  such exposure\n\nbecause they have already pled guilty.  So long as  the threat of\n\nfuture prosecution exists, it is  clear that the Fifth  Amendment\n\nprotects  defendants  from   the  threat  of  self-incrimination.\n\nZirpolo,  704 F.2d at 25.   Cotto's testimony  could have exposed\n       \n\nhim  to additional charges under both federal and state law.  The\n\n                               -4-\n\ndistrict  court  did  not  err  in  refusing  to  compel  Cotto's\n\ntestimony.  There was no basis to withdraw the plea.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Cases 92-1304 and 92-1305 are affirmed.\n                                                \n\n                               -5-\n",
