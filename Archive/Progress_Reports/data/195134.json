See,  e.g., United\r                                                                         \n\nStates  v. Innamorati,  996 F.2d 456,  469 (1st  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 114 S. Ct. 409 (1993).\r                  \n\n          On December 5, 1990, Dodd, a First Sergeant  in the\n\nU.S.  Army   Reserves,  shipped   out  to  Saudi   Arabia  in\n\npreparation for  Operation Desert Storm.   Dodd was initially\n\nassigned to the 173d Medical Group, which was responsible for\n\nmanaging health care services.  After the war ended, Dodd was\n\nassigned  additional  duties  involving  the   inspection  of\n\nequipment scheduled for transport  back to the United States.\n\nSpecifically,  he was  trained  by the  Customs Service,  the\n\nMilitary Police,  and the Department of  Agriculture to serve\n\nas a designated Customs Inspector.\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          In  August  of   1991,  Dodd  ordered  a   shipping\n\ncontainer to  be sent to his location in Saudi Arabia.  Along\n\nwith  equipment belonging  to his  reserve unit,  Dodd stored\n\nthree Iraqi  RPG ground-propelled  rocket  launchers and  two\n\nIraqi mortar tubes with tripods  and plates in the container.\n\nSubsequently, he arranged for the container to be  shipped to\n\nhis reserve unit's  home post  at Hanscom Air  Force Base  in\n\nBedford, Massachusetts.  Dodd did  not notify anyone that  he\n\nhad  placed  the  weapons,  all  of  which  were  in  working\n\ncondition,  inside the  container.   Consequently,  the  U.S.\n\nArmy,  which was the shipper  of record, did  not declare the\n\nweapons to U.S. Customs.\n\n          Dodd, whose  civilian job  was a  physical security\n\nspecialist with  the 94th ARCOM1  at Hanscom Air  Force Base,\n\nlisted  himself as the contact person to be notified when the\n\ncontainer  arrived in  Massachusetts.   Because  Dodd was  on\n\nvacation  when  the  container  arrived,  another  individual\n\nopened  it  and discovered  the  weapons.   Subsequently,  an\n\nofficer from Dodd's reserve  unit confronted Dodd and queried\n\nwhether  Dodd had the proper paperwork for the weapons.  Dodd\n\nresponded affirmatively  and then  proceeded to  create false\n\ndocuments  that  purportedly authorized  the shipment  of the\n\nweapons as war  trophies.  Prior to  the container's arrival,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  94th ARCOM is the  Army command for  the New England\narea.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nDodd had told this same officer that he (the officer) did not\n\nwant  to  know  what  equipment  was  being  shipped  in  the\n\ncontainer.\n\n          On December  22, 1992, a grand  jury indicted Dodd,\n\ncharging  him with knowingly  facilitating the transportation\n\nor concealment of illegally imported merchandise in violation\n\nof 18  U.S.C.     2  and  545.2   Following  a four-day  jury\n\ntrial, Dodd was convicted.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\n          Dodd essentially raises two  issues on appeal:  (1)\n\nthat the government failed to meet its burden in proving that\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Dodd's  indictment specifically  tracked the  language of\nthe  second prong of the second paragraph of 18 U.S.C.   545,\nwhich provides punishment for, inter alia:\r                                                     \n\n          Whoever fraudulently  or knowingly .  . .\n          in    any    manner    facilitates    the\n          transportation,  concealment, or  sale of\n          such   merchandise   after   importation,\n          knowing the same to have been imported or\n          brought into the  United States  contrary\n          to law. . . .\n\n18 U.S.C.   2 provides:\n\n          (a)  Whoever  commits an  offense against\n          the   United   States  or   aids,  abets,\n          counsels,  commands, induces  or procures\n          its  commission,  is   punishable  as   a\n          principal.\n\n          (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be\n          done which if  directly performed by  him\n          or  another would  be an  offense against\n          the United  States,  is punishable  as  a\n          principal.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  shipment of the Iraqi weapons into the United States was\n\n\"contrary  to law\" and (2)  that the relevant  language of 18\n\nU.S.C.   545 does not proscribe  the conduct for which he was\n\nconvicted.3  We discuss each in turn.        \n\nA.  Sufficiency of the Evidence:  Importation Contrary to Law\r                                                                         \n\n          Dodd contends  that the government failed  to prove\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Iraqi  weapons  were\n\nillegally  imported into the  United States.   Dodd  does not\n\ndispute that a failure to declare the weapons to U.S. Customs\n\nwould constitute a violation  of the law, but  instead argues\n\nthat  the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that\n\nthe Army did not declare them.  We do not agree.\n\n          In  assessing  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence,\n\n\"[o]ur  task is to review the record to determine whether the\n\nevidence  and  reasonable inferences  therefrom,  taken  as a\n\nwhole and  in the  light most  favorable to the  prosecution,\n\nwould allow a rational jury to determine  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that  the defendants were  guilty as charged.\"   United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v.

Additionally, Dodd recharacterizes his second argument as\na challenge  to the district  court's jury instructions.   We\nreject  this assignment  of  error for  essentially the  same\nreasons as discussed infra part II.B.\r                                      \n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994)).  \"In arriving at our determination, we must\n\ncredit both direct and  circumstantial evidence of guilt, but\n\nmust  do  so  without   evaluating  the  relative  weight  of\n\ndifferent   pieces  of   proof   or   venturing   credibility\n\njudgments.\"   United States v. De Masi, No. 92-2062, slip op.\r                                                  \n\nat 16 (1st Cir. Oct. 26, 1994) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nFurthermore,  we  do  not  ask  whether  the  government  has\n\ndisproven every reasonable hypothesis of innocence so long as\n\nthe  record as a  whole supports a verdict  of guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.   E.g., United States  v. Vavlitis, 9  F.3d\r                                                                \n\n206, 212 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          At trial, the  government introduced documents that\n\nsequentially traced  the shipment  of the  military container\n\nthat  held the weapons from  its initial delivery  to Dodd in\n\nSaudi Arabia  to its ultimate  arrival at  Hanscom Air  Force\n\nBase in  Massachusetts.   Each of these  documents referenced\n\nthe container by its military identification number.  None of\n\nthem disclosed  that the  Iraqi weapons  were  stored in  the\n\ncontainer.   Furthermore,  one  document was  stamped with  a\n\ncertification that declared  to U.S. Customs that all  of the\n\nitems covered by that  document were produced or manufactured\n\nin the United States.  \n\n          The   government   also   introduced    a   carrier\n\ncertificate for  the container  stamped by U.S.  Customs that\n\ndid not list the weapons.  A customs agent testified that, if\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthe  presence of the weapons in the container had been known,\n\ncustoms  officials  would  have  noted  them  on  this  form.\n\nClearly, a  reasonable jury  could plausibly infer  from this\n\nevidence  that the  weapons were not  declared and  thus were\n\nbrought into the United States in contravention of the law.4\n\nB.  Statutory Construction\r                                      \n\n          For   his  second   assignment   of   error,   Dodd\n\nprincipally argues that the relevant  portion of 18 U.S.C.   \n\n545  proscribes only conduct  that occurs  after importation.\n\nSee supra note 2.   He reasons that one  could not facilitate\r                     \n\ntransportation   or   concealment   of  \"merchandise\"   while\n\npossessing the requisite knowledge that it had been illegally\r                                                               \n\nimported if that \"merchandise\" had not yet entered the United\n\nStates.  Dodd further  contends that because the government's\n\nevidence established only that  he performed actions in Saudi\n\nArabia prior to  the shipment  of the weapons  to the  United\n\nStates, it was insufficient to sustain his conviction.  \n\n          Though  Dodd's  argument  presents  an  interesting\n\nquestion of  statutory construction,  we need not  address it\n\nhere.   Assuming arguendo  that Dodd has  correctly construed\r                                     \n\nthe  statute,  he nevertheless  was  also  indicted under  18\n\nU.S.C.   2.  As noted, section 2(b) of this statute provides,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  We  assume without  comment  that the  Army's failure  to\ndeclare  the   weapons  to  U.S.  Customs   would  constitute\nimportation or  shipment into the United  States \"contrary to\nlaw.\"\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n\"Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly\r                                                                         \n\nperformed by him or  another would be an offense  against the\r                            \n\nUnited  States, is punishable as  a principal.\"   18 U.S.C.  \n\n2(b) (emphasis  added).5  A defendant may  be convicted under\n\nthis  section even  though  the individual  who  did in  fact\n\ncommit  the substantive  act  lacked  the necessary  criminal\n\nintent.

Dodd's  indictment clearly  stated  that  he was  charged\nunder both 18 U.S.C.    545 and 18 U.S.C.   2.

Therefore, regardless\r                        \n\nof  whether  Dodd's  conduct  in Saudi  Arabia  was  directly\n\nprohibited by 18 U.S.C.    545, it was nonetheless punishable\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.    2(b) if it  caused actions to occur  after\n\nimportation  that, had  Dodd directly  performed them,  would\n\nhave been violations of 18 U.S.C.   545.\n\n          As a consequence of Dodd's actions in Saudi Arabia,\n\nthe military container arrived  in the United States  at Port\n\nElizabeth, New Jersey, and was subsequently shipped via truck\n\nto Hanscom Air Force Base  in Bedford, Massachusetts.  Hence,\n\nDodd's  deliberate actions  in  Saudi  Arabia caused  various\n\nindividuals  to take actions  facilitating the transportation\n\nof  the weapons after their importation.   Moreover, had Dodd\n\nperformed  these acts  directly,  he would  have violated  18\n\nU.S.C.      545  because   he  would  have   facilitated  the\n\ntransportation  of the  weapons  knowing that  they had  been\n\nillegally imported.   Therefore, 18 U.S.C.    2(b) proscribed\n\nDodd's conduct because  he caused acts to be  performed that,\n\nhad  they been  performed directly  by him,  would have  been\n\nviolations of  18 U.S.C.    545.   In other words,  by acting\n\nthrough  innocent parties who  facilitated the transportation\n\nof the weapons from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Dodd did act\n\nafter the  importation of  the weapons  knowing them to  have\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nbeen illegally imported.   In  sum, Dodd's  actions in  Saudi\n\nArabia  were sufficient  to support  his conviction  under 18\n\nU.S.C.    2(b) and 545.  \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \n\n          For   the   foregoing   reasons,  the   defendant's\n\nconviction is affirmed.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n",

Dodd was initially\n\nassigned to the 173d Medical Group, which was responsible for\n\nmanaging health care services.  After the war ended, Dodd was\n\nassigned  additional  duties  involving  the   inspection  of\n\nequipment scheduled for transport  back to the United States.\n\nSpecifically,  he was  trained  by the  Customs Service,  the\n\nMilitary Police,  and the Department of  Agriculture to serve\n\nas a designated Customs Inspector.\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          In  August  of   1991,  Dodd  ordered  a   shipping\n\ncontainer to  be sent to his location in Saudi Arabia.  Along\n\nwith  equipment belonging  to his  reserve unit,  Dodd stored\n\nthree Iraqi  RPG ground-propelled  rocket  launchers and  two\n\nIraqi mortar tubes with tripods  and plates in the container.\n\nSubsequently, he arranged for the container to be  shipped to\n\nhis reserve unit's  home post  at Hanscom Air  Force Base  in\n\nBedford, Massachusetts.  Dodd did  not notify anyone that  he\n\nhad  placed  the  weapons,  all  of  which  were  in  working\n\ncondition,  inside the  container.   Consequently,  the  U.S.\n\nArmy,  which was the shipper  of record, did  not declare the\n\nweapons to U.S. Customs.\n\n          Dodd, whose  civilian job  was a  physical security\n\nspecialist with  the 94th ARCOM1  at Hanscom Air  Force Base,\n\nlisted  himself as the contact person to be notified when the\n\ncontainer  arrived in  Massachusetts.   Because  Dodd was  on\n\nvacation  when  the  container  arrived,  another  individual\n\nopened  it  and discovered  the  weapons.   Subsequently,  an\n\nofficer from Dodd's reserve  unit confronted Dodd and queried\n\nwhether  Dodd had the proper paperwork for the weapons.  Dodd\n\nresponded affirmatively  and then  proceeded to  create false\n\ndocuments  that  purportedly authorized  the shipment  of the\n\nweapons as war  trophies.  Prior to  the container's arrival,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.

This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \n\n          Dodd essentially raises two  issues on appeal:  (1)\n\nthat the government failed to meet its burden in proving that\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Dodd's  indictment specifically  tracked the  language of\nthe  second prong of the second paragraph of 18 U.S.C.   545,\nwhich provides punishment for, inter alia:\r                                                     \n\n          Whoever fraudulently  or knowingly .  . .\n          in    any    manner    facilitates    the\n          transportation,  concealment, or  sale of\n          such   merchandise   after   importation,\n          knowing the same to have been imported or\n          brought into the  United States  contrary\n          to law. . . .\n\n18 U.S.C.   2 provides:\n\n          (a)  Whoever  commits an  offense against\n          the   United   States  or   aids,  abets,\n          counsels,  commands, induces  or procures\n          its  commission,  is   punishable  as   a\n          principal.\n\n          (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be\n          done which if  directly performed by  him\n          or  another would  be an  offense against\n          the United  States,  is punishable  as  a\n          principal.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  shipment of the Iraqi weapons into the United States was\n\n\"contrary  to law\" and (2)  that the relevant  language of 18\n\nU.S.C.   545 does not proscribe  the conduct for which he was\n\nconvicted.3  We discuss each in turn.        \n\nA.  Sufficiency of the Evidence:  Importation Contrary to Law\r                                                                         \n\n          Dodd contends  that the government failed  to prove\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  Iraqi  weapons  were\n\nillegally  imported into the  United States.   Dodd  does not\n\ndispute that a failure to declare the weapons to U.S. Customs\n\nwould constitute a violation  of the law, but  instead argues\n\nthat  the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that\n\nthe Army did not declare them.  We do not agree.\n\n          In  assessing  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence,\n\n\"[o]ur  task is to review the record to determine whether the\n\nevidence  and  reasonable inferences  therefrom,  taken  as a\n\nwhole and  in the  light most  favorable to the  prosecution,\n\nwould allow a rational jury to determine  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that  the defendants were  guilty as charged.\"   United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v.

E.g., United States  v. Vavlitis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r                                                                \n\n<span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          At trial, the  government introduced documents that\n\nsequentially traced  the shipment  of the  military container\n\nthat  held the weapons from  its initial delivery  to Dodd in\n\nSaudi Arabia  to its ultimate  arrival at  Hanscom Air  Force\n\nBase in  Massachusetts.   Each of these  documents referenced\n\nthe container by its military identification number.  None of\n\nthem disclosed  that the  Iraqi weapons  were  stored in  the\n\ncontainer.   Furthermore,  one  document was  stamped with  a\n\ncertification that declared  to U.S. Customs that all  of the\n\nitems covered by that  document were produced or manufactured\n\nin the United States.  \n\n          The   government   also   introduced    a   carrier\n\ncertificate for  the container  stamped by U.S.  Customs that\n\ndid not list the weapons.  A customs agent testified that, if\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthe  presence of the weapons in the container had been known,\n\ncustoms  officials  would  have  noted  them  on  this  form.\n\nClearly, a  reasonable jury  could plausibly infer  from this\n\nevidence  that the  weapons were not  declared and  thus were\n\nbrought into the United States in contravention of the law.4\n\nB.  Statutory Construction\r                                      \n\n          For   his  second   assignment   of   error,   Dodd\n\nprincipally argues that the relevant  portion of 18 U.S.C.   \n\n545  proscribes only conduct  that occurs  after importation.\n\nSee supra note 2.   He reasons that one  could not facilitate\r                     \n\ntransportation   or   concealment   of  \"merchandise\"   while\n\npossessing the requisite knowledge that it had been illegally\r                                                               \n\nimported if that \"merchandise\" had not yet entered the United\n\nStates.  Dodd further  contends that because the government's\n\nevidence established only that  he performed actions in Saudi\n\nArabia prior to  the shipment  of the weapons  to the  United\n\nStates, it was insufficient to sustain his conviction.  \n\n          Though  Dodd's  argument  presents  an  interesting\n\nquestion of  statutory construction,  we need not  address it\n\nhere.   Assuming arguendo  that Dodd has  correctly construed\r                                     \n\nthe  statute,  he nevertheless  was  also  indicted under  18\n\nU.S.C.   2.  As noted, section 2(b) of this statute provides,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  We  assume without  comment  that the  Army's failure  to\ndeclare  the   weapons  to  U.S.  Customs   would  constitute\nimportation or  shipment into the United  States \"contrary to\nlaw.\"\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n\"Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly\r                                                                         \n\nperformed by him or  another would be an offense  against the\r                            \n\nUnited  States, is punishable as  a principal.\"   18 U.S.C.  \n\n2(b) (emphasis  added).5  A defendant may  be convicted under\n\nthis  section even  though  the individual  who  did in  fact\n\ncommit  the substantive  act  lacked  the necessary  criminal\n\nintent.

Therefore, regardless\r                        \n\nof  whether  Dodd's  conduct  in Saudi  Arabia  was  directly\n\nprohibited by 18 U.S.C.    545, it was nonetheless punishable\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.    2(b) if it  caused actions to occur  after\n\nimportation  that, had  Dodd directly  performed them,  would\n\nhave been violations of 18 U.S.C.   545.\n\n          As a consequence of Dodd's actions in Saudi Arabia,\n\nthe military container arrived  in the United States  at Port\n\nElizabeth, New Jersey, and was subsequently shipped via truck\n\nto Hanscom Air Force Base  in Bedford, Massachusetts.  Hence,\n\nDodd's  deliberate actions  in  Saudi  Arabia caused  various\n\nindividuals  to take actions  facilitating the transportation\n\nof  the weapons after their importation.   Moreover, had Dodd\n\nperformed  these acts  directly,  he would  have violated  18\n\nU.S.C.      545  because   he  would  have   facilitated  the\n\ntransportation  of the  weapons  knowing that  they had  been\n\nillegally imported.   Therefore, 18 U.S.C.    2(b) proscribed\n\nDodd's conduct because  he caused acts to be  performed that,\n\nhad  they been  performed directly  by him,  would have  been\n\nviolations of  18 U.S.C.    545.   In other words,  by acting\n\nthrough  innocent parties who  facilitated the transportation\n\nof the weapons from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Dodd did act\n\nafter the  importation of  the weapons  knowing them to  have\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nbeen illegally imported.
