See 21-A\n                                                            \n\nM.R.S.A.   303(1).   Second, the group  may organize a  political\n\nparty  around a  prior candidate  for the  office of  Governor or\n\nPresident who  (1) was not  affiliated with  a registered  party;\n\n(2) consents in writing;  and (3)  received more than  5% of  the\n\ntotal Maine vote cast for the office of Governor or President, as\n\nthe case  may be, in  the immediately preceding  gubernatorial or\n\npresidential  election.   See id.  at   302(1).    A  party which\n                                 \n\norganizes  itself under   302(1),  on the \"coattails\"  of a prior\n\nindependent candidate  for office, need  not demonstrate  contem-\n\nporaneously the  level of voter support defined  in   303(1), but\n\nthe  party's candidates  remain subject  to the  numerical voter-\n\nsupport   requirements for later listing  on the general election\n\nballot.

With these benefits come certain respon-\n   \n\nsibilities, including the obligation  to hold municipal  caucuses\n\nduring  election year, 21-A M.R.S.A.    301(1)(A), 311; to hold a\n\nbiennial  state  convention,  id.  at   301(1)(B),  321;  and  to\n                                 \n\nnominate candidates  for office  through a primary  election pro-\n\ncess,  id. at   331(1).  The primary election process is intended\n          \n\nto control \"ballot clutter\" by ensuring that each political party\n\nnominates only one  candidate for any particular office, and that\n\nthe  party nominee  possesses  the prescribed  levels of  support\n\nwithin  his or her party and the general electorate.

By the  date of the\n\n                    \n\n     1In May  1984, the  Party sought to  place its  presidential\ncandidates on the Maine ballot by means of a nomination petition,\nbut fell short of the 4000 signatures required under the statuto-\nry  predecessor  to    354.   The  Maine  Supreme  Judicial Court\nrejected the Party's challenge  to the signature requirement, and\ndenied  the Party's motion to  enjoin the Secretary  to place the\ncandidates'  names on the general election ballot.  See Crafts v.\n                                                              \nQuinn, 482 A.2d 825 (Me. 1984).  In June 1990, the Party began an\n     \norganizing campaign  to \"qualify\" as an  official political party\nunder  the   303 petition process, which apparently fell short of\nthe level of voter support required by   303(1).\n\n                                7\n\nprimary election on  June 9, 1992, it  had enrolled 1,048  regis-\n\ntered voters  statewide, but  did not have  sufficient concentra-\n\ntions of membership support to satisfy the signature requirements\n\nunder    335 for getting the  appellant candidates on the primary\n                                                  \n\nelection ballots  in their respective districts.2   The appellant\n\ncandidates participated  as  write-in  candidates  in  the  Party\n\nprimary,  and in some instances  won a plurality  of the write-in\n\nvotes cast in  their respective districts,3 but the  total number\n\nof their write-in votes was insufficient to qualify the appellant\n\ncandidates for the general election ballot under   723(1)(A).4\n\n          Anticipating  its candidates' inability  to qualify for\n\nthe  general election  ballot  through the  prescribed  statutory\n\nprocess, the Party amended its by-laws on May 17, 1992, to permit\n\n                    \n\n     2Two of the Party's  candidates, Victoria Linne and Carleton\nMabee,  did meet  the signature  requirements for listing  on the\nprimary  ballot for  the office  of State  Representative.   Both\nreceived a plurality  of votes in  their respective districts  in\nthe  Party primary  (Linne  received 26  votes, Mabee  received 2\nvotes),  and both  qualified  for the  November general  election\nballot under   331.  Neither is named as a party to this appeal.\n\n     3Some of the appellant candidates failed to obtain a plural-\nity  of support  in  the Party  primary.   For  example,  Charles\nPotratz,  the  candidate nominated  at  the  Party convention  to\nrepresent  Senate  District 4,  finished  third  in the  District\n                                               \nprimary (one write-in vote) behind Charles Webster and Dana White\n(each with  four votes).   In Maine's  Second Congressional  Dis-\ntrict,  the Party's nominated  candidate, Paul Fichtner, finished\nsecond (22 votes) to Olympia Snowe (30 votes).\n      \n\n     4A total of 103 write-in votes were cast, for 23 candidates,\nto determine  the Party's nominees for  Maine's two Congressional\nseats.  The poor showing occurred despite the fact that the Party\npermitted independent voters  as well as Party  members to parti-\ncipate in its  primary.   The Secretary of  State represented  at\noral  argument  that  independent  (unenrolled)  voters  make  up\napproximately one-third  of the Maine  electorate, i.e., approxi-\n                                                       \nmately 300,000 voters statewide.\n\n                                8\n\nits candidates in  the general  election to be  nominated at  the\n\nParty convention.   Following their nomination, the  names of the\n\nappellant  candidates  were   submitted  to   defendant-appellee,\n\nSecretary of State William Diamond (\"Secretary\"), who declined to\n\nplace their  names  on the  general election  ballot, citing  the\n\nmandatory  language of  the  Maine election  code.   See  id.  at\n                                                             \n\n  331(1) (\"a party's nomination of a candidate for federal, state\n\nor  county office shall  be made by  primary election\") (emphasis\n                                                     \n\nadded);    7 (\"[w]hen used in  this Title, the  words 'shall' and\n\n'must' are used in a mandatory  sense to impose an obligation  to\n\nact or refrain from acting\").\n\n          On  August 10, 1992,  the Party  brought an  action for\n\ninjunctive relief against the Secretary, challenging, inter alia,\n                                                                \n\nthe  constitutionality  of  Maine's  ballot-access  restrictions.\n\nFollowing an expedited hearing,  the district court dismissed the\n\naction.  See Libertarian Party of  Maine v. Diamond, 799 F. Supp.\n                                                   \n\n1 (D. Me. 1992).  We denied injunctive relief  pending appeal, on\n\nthe  ground that appellants had not shown a likelihood of success\n\non the merits of their constitutional claim.  In the 1992 general\n\nelection, no  Party candidate  was elected  to any  state office.\n\nThe  Party's  presidential  candidates, Andrew  Marrou  and Nancy\n\nLord,  who were  \"automatically\" listed  on the  general election\n\nballot, received approximately one-quarter  of one percent of the\n\nMaine popular vote.5\n\n                    \n\n     5Because the Party's presidential  candidates failed to poll\nthe  5% voter support needed to maintain \"official party\" status,\nthe  Secretary contends  that the  Party lost  its standing  as a\n\n                                9\n\n          Reiterating  their  constitutional  claims  on  appeal,\n\nappellants  note that a Party  candidate may be  denied access to\n\nthe  general election ballot under the  Maine election code, even\n                                                                 \n\nif s/he commands the support of a plurality of the voters partic-\n  \n\nipating in the Party's district  primary, unless s/he also  shows\n                                                          \n\nthat the Party itself  has sufficient support, in the  particular\n                     \n\n                    \n\n\"qualified\" party  under Maine  law, and that  its constitutional\nclaim is moot.  See 21-A   M.R.S.A.   304 (\"a party . . .  is not\n                   \nqualified to participate in  a subsequent primary election unless\nit meets the requirements of   301\"); see also id. at   301(1)(C)\n                                                  \n(\"a party qualifies to participate in a primary election if . . .\nits candidate for Governor or for President polled at least 5% of\nthe total vote cast in the State for Governor or President in the\nlast preceding  gubernatorial  or presidential  election\").    We\nreject the State's contention, for three reasons.\n     First, we do  not assume that a party is  in fact subject to\ndisqualification under   301(1)(C) where its candidates failed to\npoll 5% of the total vote in the preceding presidential election,\nbut did succeed  in polling the requisite 5% level  of support in\n       \nthe preceding gubernatorial election.  As noted, Andrew Adam (who\n                           \nsubsequently allowed the Party  to petition for \"official\" status\nunder his name) polled  9% of the vote in  the 1990 gubernatorial\nelection, and  the Party contends  that this showing  \"will carry\nthe Party through the 1994 gubernatorial election,\" regardless of\nits performance in the intervening Presidential race.\n     Second,  and more important, it  may be that  the process of\ndisqualification  under   304 is not  automatic, as it appears to\nrequire  a formal  determination by  the Secretary,  under   305,\nthat  the Party has not met the  requirements of   301(1)(C).  To\nour  knowledge, the  Secretary has made  no such  official deter-\nmination.   To the  extent that such a  determination is a prere-\nquisite  to party  disqualification, the  Party would  retain its\nstanding, and the State's argument would be groundless.\n     Finally, in all events the Party's complaint is one which is\n\"capable of  repetition, yet  evading review.\"   See Anderson  v.\n                                                             \nCelebrezze, 460  U.S. 780,  784 n.3  (1983); Democratic Party  of\n                                                                 \nUnited States v.

So  long as the challenged statutory  scheme remains\nin  effect, the  Party and  other small  parties may  qualify for\n\"official\"  party  status under    302; so  long as  they qualify\nwithout the necessary support  to meet the signature requirements\nof    335(5), the possibility exists that they will be \"shut out\"\nof ballot access, as alleged here.\n\n                                10\n\nelectoral subdivision, to enable the candidate (1) to gather  the\n\nrequisite  signatures  from  Party  members to  qualify  for  the\n\nprimary ballot under   335(5); or (2) to qualify for  the general\n                                 \n\nelection ballot by obtaining  sufficient voter participation in a\n\nwrite-in  election under    723(1)(A).   Appellants  assert  that\n\nthese additional requirements are unnecessary and unconstitution-\n\nally burdensome, since the Party has already qualified, under 21-\n\nA    M.R.S.A.   302,  as  an  organization possessing  \"statewide\n\nsupport.\"   Furthermore,  appellants  assert,  if any  additional\n\nshowing of support is necessary, the Party should be able to rely\n\non demonstrations of support from  other voters outside the Party\n\nranks.\n\n                               III\n\n          Limitations upon  ballot access may  impinge two funda-\n\nmental  constitutional  rights:   \"the  right  of individuals  to\n\nassociate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right\n\nof qualified voters, regardless of their political persuasion, to\n\ncast  their votes effectively.\"  See Williams v.

A State is  permitted to consider  a\n       \n\nparty's primary-election performance as  a relevant factor in its\n\nmeasurement of \"significant support.\"  See, e.g., Munro, 479 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 196-197 (upholding requirement  that minor parties poll  1% of\n\nparticipating  electorate  in  primary  election;  observing that\n\n                                13\n\n\"[t]he  primary election . . . is 'an integral part of the entire\n\nelection process . . .

We do\n\nnot  agree.  By choosing  to qualify under  the \"coattail\" provi-\n\nsion, the Party bypassed the requirement of mustering significant\n                        \n\nnumerical support among eligible voters, rather  than demonstrat-\n                                                                 \n\ning its capacity to do so.  As far as the record shows, the Party\n   \n\nhas submitted  no petitions,  enrolled few members,  and garnered\n\nlittle support for the candidates who ran under its banner in the\n\n1992 and earlier elections.   Indeed, its only significant  spon-\n\nsorship to date has been the endorsement of Andrew Adam, whose 9%\n\nshowing in the 1990 gubernatorial elections may have suggested an\n                                                              \n\nability to interest independents in Party enrollment, but clearly\n\ndid not ensure that such support could or would be  obtained.  In\n              \n\nthese  circumstances, we  think the  State retained  a legitimate\n\ninterest in ensuring that  the Party in fact possessed  a minimal\n                                            \n\nlevel  of  support among  the  electorate, as  a  prerequisite to\n\nlisting  the  appellant candidates  on  the  primary and  general\n\nelection ballots.6\n\n                    \n\n     6We believe  the absence of  any prior numerical  showing of\nsupport distinguishes this case from Tashjian v. Republican Party\n                                                                 \nof Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208 (1986), and Consumer Party v.

The Supreme\n\nCourt  recently confirmed that a  State possesses a separate, and\n                                                            \n\nadditional, interest in ascertaining that a political party which\n          \n\nnominates candidates  for office in an electoral subdivision of a\n\nlarger  political unit  demonstrate  support  in  the  particular\n                                                                 \n\nelectoral  subdivision for which the candidate is nominated.

But the  Republican  Party  (with 425,695  registered\nmembers)  already  had  demonstrated  a  \"significant modicum  of\nsupport\"  among  the  general  voter population,  under  a  legal\nstandard substantially  stricter than Maine imposes.

As all appellant candidates sought\n\nelective  office  at the  local  or district  level,  rather than\n\nstatewide,7  the State had  a legitimate  interest in  ensuring a\n\nmodicum of candidate support among the relevant voter constituen-\n\ncies, over and above  any general support which might  be imputed\n\nto the Party based on Adam's \"statewide\" success in 1990.\n\nB.

Burden on Associational Interests\n                                      \n\n                                17\n\n          We next consider the burdensomeness of Maine's elector-\n\nal scheme.  Like all such schemes, Maine's ballot-access restric-\n\ntions  \"inevitably affect[]     at  least to  some degree     the\n\nindividual's right to vote and his right to associate with others\n\nfor political ends.\"  Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  After carefully\n                              \n\nexamining the  effects  of  Maine's  nomination  procedures,  the\n\ndistrict   court  concluded  that  the  challenged  ballot-access\n\nrequirements  were neither  inappropriate to  their purposes  nor\n\nunconstitutionally burdensome.  We agree.\n                  \n\n          As the  district court  noted, the levels  of electoral\n\nsupport Party candidates are required  to demonstrate in order to\n\nget on the Party's primary ballot are not high:\n\n          The record shows that there are approximately\n          876,000 registered voters in Maine.  In Maine\n          there  are two Congressional  seats, 35 state\n          senate  seats,  and 151  state representative\n          seats.   If  each electoral  division has  an\n          equal  number of  voters, then  each Congres-\n          sional  district   would  have  approximately\n          438,000  voters,  each state  senate district\n          would have approximately  25,000 voters,  and\n          each state representative district would have\n          approximately 5,800 voters.  The requirements\n          for  primary  petition  signatures for  these\n          three districts  are 1,000, 100  and 25,  re-\n          spectively.  Therefore, the numbers [of Party\n          members' signatures] that an  aspiring Liber-\n          tarian  candidate for each of these positions\n          would need  amount to 0.22%, 0.4%, and 0.43%,\n          respectively,  of  the  registered voters  in\n          each district.\n\n799  F. Supp. at  4.  We  endorse the district  court's view that\n\nthese  signature  requirements  indeed  are modest  in  numerical\n\nterms.

Any broader  view, says the  Party,\n      \n\nwould treat  all registered voters as  potential Party enrollees,\n\n\"amount[ing] to forced political association\" violative  of First\n\nAmendment rights.

Nevertheless, challenges to\nthe overbreadth  of a  statutory scheme, as  impeding appellants'\nFirst Amendment associational  rights, are  widely recognized  as\nexceptions  to the  rule that  \"a person  to whom  a statute  may\nconstitutionally be applied will  not be heard to  challenge that\nstatute  on the grounds that it may conceivably be applied uncon-\nstitutionally  to others.\"   See Broadrick v.  Oklahoma, 413 U.S.\n                                                       \n601, 610 (1973).\n\n                                20\n\naccess requirements of   335.  We see the issue somewhat  differ-\n\nently, however.  We  need not decide whether there may be circum-\n\nstances in which significant constitutional problems would result\n\nfrom a regulatory  scheme which precluded  candidate access to  a\n\nparty's ballot by different means  than those under challenge  in\n\nthis case.   If such limits  exist, it suffices to  say that they\n\nhave not been reached under the Maine electoral scheme.  \n\n          First, the  burden about  which the Party  complains is\n\nself-imposed, for the most part.  Under Maine law, a  party which\n\nadopts restrictive membership policies  is not required to assume\n                                                       \n\n\"qualified\" status under   301 et seq.,  or to assume the burdens\n                                      \n\nof the primary nomination requirement imposed by   331.   Indeed,\n\na party can choose to \"disqualify\" itself at any time up to April\n\n15  of an election year, even after submitting the party designa-\n\ntion and  consent of  its 'coattail'  candidate  under    302(1),\n\nmerely  by eschewing  the municipal  caucuses required  by   302-\n\n(3).11   If a party  voluntarily chooses     or  continues     to\n\npursue  the    302 procedure  for  electoral  participation as  a\n\n\"qualified\" party,  it must  be  understood to  have assumed  the\n\n                    \n\n     11The April 15 deadline  occurs two weeks after the  April 1\ndeadline for  primary  candidates to  file  nomination  petitions\nunder   335(8).  Thus,  any new or small party, uncertain  of its\nmembership support,  may withhold the  final certification neces-\nsary  for \"party qualification\"  while it attempts  to enroll the\nmembers  necessary  to nominate  its  candidates  to the  primary\nelection ballot.  If, by April 1, the required membership support\nis  lacking in  one or  more electoral  districts, the  party may\nchoose      simply by  withholding  the  certification of  caucus\nparticipation under   302(3)    to nominate its candidates to the\ngeneral ballot by the \"nomination petition\" procedure  prescribed\nby   351 et seq.\n                \n\n                                21\n\nburden  of maintaining  membership rolls  sufficient to  nominate\n\ncandidates through the primary election process.\n\n          Second, and equally  important, a  party which  chooses\n\nnot to participate  in primary elections  as a \"qualified\"  party\n\nretains  the  option  to  qualify candidates  for  the  statewide\n\nelection  ballot through  the   351 \"nomination  petition\" proce-\n\ndure.  The Party has offered no evidence whatever to suggest that\n\nthis  alternate route to the printed ballot is substantially more\n\nburdensome for a small  party than a primary-qualification proce-\n\ndure.12   In fact,  in the 1992  elections, at least  three inde-\n\npendent candidates for President    Lenora Fulani, H. Ross Perot,\n\nand Howard Phillips    mustered the requisite 4000 signatures and\n\nqualified  by  petition to  be  listed, along  with  their chosen\n\n\"political designation,\" on Maine's  general election ballot.  As\n\nthe  Supreme Court recognized in  Jenness, 403 U.S.  at 441-42, a\n                                         \n\nnomination petition procedure for  ballot access by new  or small\n\npolitical parties is not inherently impermissible, merely because\n\nit is different from the  procedure permitted for larger parties,\n\nprovided  the  procedure imposes  no  undue burden.    \"There are\n\nobvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a\n\n                    \n\n     12Although a \"nomination petition\" requires twice the number\nof signatures a party candidate would be  required to obtain on a\nprimary petition,  see 21-A M.R.S.A.    354(5), these  signatures\n                      \nmay be obtained from any  registered voter, even voters  enrolled\n                        \nin other parties.  Moreover, the number of required signatures is\nstill quite low, compared to the signature requirements upheld as\nreasonable in other contexts by the Supreme Court.  See supra pp.\n                                                             \n18-19.   And a party which mobilizes its efforts toward garnering\nsignatures on  a nomination  petition is spared  \"the Procrustean\nrequirement  of establishing  elaborate primary  election machin-\nery.\"  Jenness, 403 U.S. at 438.\n              \n\n                                22\n\npolitical party  with historically established broad  support, on\n\nthe one hand, and  a new or small  political organization on  the\n\nother.

In these  circumstances,\nthe  write-in  procedure  imposes  little,  if  any,  comparative\ndisadvantage to small party candidates who are able to muster the\nrequisite electoral support, and any awkwardness in the mechanics\nof  the write-in  process is  adequately counterbalanced,  in our\nview,  by the State's legitimate interests in requiring that such\nsupport be demonstrated.  \n\n                                24\n\n          Under  Maine's election  code, small  political parties\n\nmay choose to \"qualify\"  under the \"sponsorship\" procedure estab-\n\nlished  in    302(1),  postponing  any  showing  of  \"significant\n\ncommunity  support\" under   303,  if the party,  its sponsor, and\n\nits candidates believe they can enroll enough members to meet the\n\nrequirements of primary  ballot access  under   335(5).   If  the\n\nparty is unable  to meet  these requirements  for primary  ballot\n\naccess,  it  may either  (1) draw  on  independent voters  in its\n\nprimary, mustering a qualifying number  of write-in votes for its\n\nparty  candidates,  under   723(1)(A),  or  (2) disqualify itself\n\nunder    302(3),  and  proceed  under  the \"nomination  petition\"\n\nprocess  of   351.    The Libertarian  Party attempted  to enroll\n\nmembers under   302(1),  but failed.  Rather than elect disquali-\n\nfication,  the Party then  chose to muster  independent voters to\n\nits  primary banner under the    338 write-in process.   It again\n\nfailed to show \"significant support.\"  Under these circumstances,\n\nwe  do not believe that appellants' constitutional rights, or the\n\nrights of the  Party's members or other  prospective voters, were\n\nimpermissibly burdened  by the Party's  subsequent exclusion from\n\nthe general election ballot.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                25\n",

Second, the group  may organize a  political\n\nparty  around a  prior candidate  for the  office of  Governor or\n\nPresident who  (1) was not  affiliated with  a registered  party;\n\n(2) consents in writing;  and (3)  received more than  5% of  the\n\ntotal Maine vote cast for the office of Governor or President, as\n\nthe case  may be, in  the immediately preceding  gubernatorial or\n\npresidential  election.

By the  date of the\n\n                    \n\n     1In May  1984, the  Party sought to  place its  presidential\ncandidates on the Maine ballot by means of a nomination petition,\nbut fell short of the 4000 signatures required under the statuto-\nry  predecessor  to    354.   The  Maine  Supreme  Judicial Court\nrejected the Party's challenge  to the signature requirement, and\ndenied  the Party's motion to  enjoin the Secretary  to place the\ncandidates'  names on the general election ballot.

In June 1990, the Party began an\n     \norganizing campaign  to \"qualify\" as an  official political party\nunder  the   303 petition process, which apparently fell short of\nthe level of voter support required by   303(1).\n\n                                7\n\nprimary election on  June 9, 1992, it  had enrolled 1,048  regis-\n\ntered voters  statewide, but  did not have  sufficient concentra-\n\ntions of membership support to satisfy the signature requirements\n\nunder    335 for getting the  appellant candidates on the primary\n                                                  \n\nelection ballots  in their respective districts.2   The appellant\n\ncandidates participated  as  write-in  candidates  in  the  Party\n\nprimary,  and in some instances  won a plurality  of the write-in\n\nvotes cast in  their respective districts,3 but the  total number\n\nof their write-in votes was insufficient to qualify the appellant\n\ncandidates for the general election ballot under   723(1)(A).4\n\n          Anticipating  its candidates' inability  to qualify for\n\nthe  general election  ballot  through the  prescribed  statutory\n\nprocess, the Party amended its by-laws on May 17, 1992, to permit\n\n                    \n\n     2Two of the Party's  candidates, Victoria Linne and Carleton\nMabee,  did meet  the signature  requirements for listing  on the\nprimary  ballot for  the office  of State  Representative.   Both\nreceived a plurality  of votes in  their respective districts  in\nthe  Party primary  (Linne  received 26  votes, Mabee  received 2\nvotes),  and both  qualified  for the  November general  election\nballot under   331.  Neither is named as a party to this appeal.\n\n     3Some of the appellant candidates failed to obtain a plural-\nity  of support  in  the Party  primary.   For  example,  Charles\nPotratz,  the  candidate nominated  at  the  Party convention  to\nrepresent  Senate  District 4,  finished  third  in the  District\n                                               \nprimary (one write-in vote) behind Charles Webster and Dana White\n(each with  four votes).   In Maine's  Second Congressional  Dis-\ntrict,  the Party's nominated  candidate, Paul Fichtner, finished\nsecond (22 votes) to Olympia Snowe (30 votes).\n      \n\n     4A total of 103 write-in votes were cast, for 23 candidates,\nto determine  the Party's nominees for  Maine's two Congressional\nseats.  The poor showing occurred despite the fact that the Party\npermitted independent voters  as well as Party  members to parti-\ncipate in its  primary.   The Secretary of  State represented  at\noral  argument  that  independent  (unenrolled)  voters  make  up\napproximately one-third  of the Maine  electorate, i.e., approxi-\n                                                       \nmately 300,000 voters statewide.\n\n                                8\n\nits candidates in  the general  election to be  nominated at  the\n\nParty convention.   Following their nomination, the  names of the\n\nappellant  candidates  were   submitted  to   defendant-appellee,\n\nSecretary of State William Diamond (\"Secretary\"), who declined to\n\nplace their  names  on the  general election  ballot, citing  the\n\nmandatory  language of  the  Maine election  code.   See  id.  at\n                                                             \n\n  331(1) (\"a party's nomination of a candidate for federal, state\n\nor  county office shall  be made by  primary election\") (emphasis\n                                                     \n\nadded);    7 (\"[w]hen used in  this Title, the  words 'shall' and\n\n'must' are used in a mandatory  sense to impose an obligation  to\n\nact or refrain from acting\").\n\n          On  August 10, 1992,  the Party  brought an  action for\n\ninjunctive relief against the Secretary, challenging, inter alia,\n                                                                \n\nthe  constitutionality  of  Maine's  ballot-access  restrictions.\n\nFollowing an expedited hearing,  the district court dismissed the\n\naction.

We denied injunctive relief  pending appeal, on\n\nthe  ground that appellants had not shown a likelihood of success\n\non the merits of their constitutional claim.  In the 1992 general\n\nelection, no  Party candidate  was elected  to any  state office.\n\nThe  Party's  presidential  candidates, Andrew  Marrou  and Nancy\n\nLord,  who were  \"automatically\" listed  on the  general election\n\nballot, received approximately one-quarter  of one percent of the\n\nMaine popular vote.5\n\n                    \n\n     5Because the Party's presidential  candidates failed to poll\nthe  5% voter support needed to maintain \"official party\" status,\nthe  Secretary contends  that the  Party lost  its standing  as a\n\n                                9\n\n          Reiterating  their  constitutional  claims  on  appeal,\n\nappellants  note that a Party  candidate may be  denied access to\n\nthe  general election ballot under the  Maine election code, even\n                                                                 \n\nif s/he commands the support of a plurality of the voters partic-\n  \n\nipating in the Party's district  primary, unless s/he also  shows\n                                                          \n\nthat the Party itself  has sufficient support, in the  particular\n                     \n\n                    \n\n\"qualified\" party  under Maine  law, and that  its constitutional\nclaim is moot.  See 21-A   M.R.S.A.   304 (\"a party . . .  is not\n                   \nqualified to participate in  a subsequent primary election unless\nit meets the requirements of   301\"); see also id. at   301(1)(C)\n                                                  \n(\"a party qualifies to participate in a primary election if . . .\nits candidate for Governor or for President polled at least 5% of\nthe total vote cast in the State for Governor or President in the\nlast preceding  gubernatorial  or presidential  election\").    We\nreject the State's contention, for three reasons.\n     First, we do  not assume that a party is  in fact subject to\ndisqualification under   301(1)(C) where its candidates failed to\npoll 5% of the total vote in the preceding presidential election,\nbut did succeed  in polling the requisite 5% level  of support in\n       \nthe preceding gubernatorial election.  As noted, Andrew Adam (who\n                           \nsubsequently allowed the Party  to petition for \"official\" status\nunder his name) polled  9% of the vote in  the 1990 gubernatorial\nelection, and  the Party contends  that this showing  \"will carry\nthe Party through the 1994 gubernatorial election,\" regardless of\nits performance in the intervening Presidential race.\n     Second,  and more important, it  may be that  the process of\ndisqualification  under   304 is not  automatic, as it appears to\nrequire  a formal  determination by  the Secretary,  under   305,\nthat  the Party has not met the  requirements of   301(1)(C).  To\nour  knowledge, the  Secretary has made  no such  official deter-\nmination.   To the  extent that such a  determination is a prere-\nquisite  to party  disqualification, the  Party would  retain its\nstanding, and the State's argument would be groundless.\n     Finally, in all events the Party's complaint is one which is\n\"capable of  repetition, yet  evading review.\"   See Anderson  v.\n                                                             \nCelebrezze, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  784 n.3  (1983); Democratic Party  of\n                                                                 \nUnited States v.

As far as the record shows, the Party\n   \n\nhas submitted  no petitions,  enrolled few members,  and garnered\n\nlittle support for the candidates who ran under its banner in the\n\n1992 and earlier elections.   Indeed, its only significant  spon-\n\nsorship to date has been the endorsement of Andrew Adam, whose 9%\n\nshowing in the 1990 gubernatorial elections may have suggested an\n                                                              \n\nability to interest independents in Party enrollment, but clearly\n\ndid not ensure that such support could or would be  obtained.  In\n              \n\nthese  circumstances, we  think the  State retained  a legitimate\n\ninterest in ensuring that  the Party in fact possessed  a minimal\n                                            \n\nlevel  of  support among  the  electorate, as  a  prerequisite to\n\nlisting  the  appellant candidates  on  the  primary and  general\n\nelection ballots.6\n\n                    \n\n     6We believe  the absence of  any prior numerical  showing of\nsupport distinguishes this case from Tashjian v.

In Tashjian, the Supreme Court  invalidated a\n                               \nstate law prohibiting the  participation of independent voters in\nselecting  convention-nominated candidates in  a Republican Party\nprimary.    But the  Republican  Party  (with 425,695  registered\nmembers)  already  had  demonstrated  a  \"significant modicum  of\nsupport\"  among  the  general  voter population,  under  a  legal\nstandard substantially  stricter than Maine imposes.   See id. at\n                                                              \n211  n.2 (citing  Conn. Gen.  Stat.   9-372(5)(B)  (1985)) (major\nparties,  eligible to  participate in  primaries, must  have \"re-\n                                                             \"\nceived  . . . at  least twenty  per cent of  the whole  number of\n                                        \nvotes  cast for  all  candidates for  governor\" in  the preceding\nelection).    Clearly, in  Tashjian  the  States retained  little\n                                   \ncompelling  interest,  prior  to  the  challenged  elections,  in\nreevaluating  the Republican  Party's  \"support.\"   Likewise,  in\nDavis,  a district  court invalidated  changes to  Pennsylvania's\n     \nballot-access restrictions that had the effect of \"disqualifying\"\na political party which  (unlike the Party here) already  had met\n                                                                 \nsignature requirements for  demonstrating \"significant  support,\"\n                                                               ,\nunder an earlier version of  the statute at issue.  Although  the\nDavis  court did  not  rely on  the Consumer  Party's preexisting\n     \nparty status,  that fact figures significantly  in our evaluation\nof its precedential weight in the circumstances of this case. \n\n                                15\n\nelection ballots are overloaded with candidacies who lack even  a\n\nmodicum of support  among eligible voters poses  similar risks in\n\nlocal and district elections.  As all appellant candidates sought\n\nelective  office  at the  local  or district  level,  rather than\n\nstatewide,7  the State had  a legitimate  interest in  ensuring a\n\nmodicum of candidate support among the relevant voter constituen-\n\ncies, over and above  any general support which might  be imputed\n\nto the Party based on Adam's \"statewide\" success in 1990.\n\nB.   Regulating Primary Participation\n                                     \n\n          States possess a comparable interest in ensuring that a\n\nparty's nominating process  includes sufficient participation  by\n\nthe party's own members or supporters.  Absent some level of par-\n\nticipation by  party members, the integrity  of party nominations\n\nmight  be  compromised by  \"party  raiding,\"  whereby \"voters  in\n\nsympathy with one party . . .  influence or determine the results\n\nof  another party's primary,\"  Rosario, 410 U.S. at 761-62, which\n                                      \n\nin turn  could threaten  the integrity  of general elections  and\n\ndilute  the informative function of a party's label as a descrip-\n\ntion of its collective political purpose.

Burden on Associational Interests\n                                      \n\n                                17\n\n          We next consider the burdensomeness of Maine's elector-\n\nal scheme.  Like all such schemes, Maine's ballot-access restric-\n\ntions  \"inevitably affect[]     at  least to  some degree     the\n\nindividual's right to vote and his right to associate with others\n\nfor political ends.\"  Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  After carefully\n                              \n\nexamining the  effects  of  Maine's  nomination  procedures,  the\n\ndistrict   court  concluded  that  the  challenged  ballot-access\n\nrequirements  were neither  inappropriate to  their purposes  nor\n\nunconstitutionally burdensome.  We agree.\n                  \n\n          As the  district court  noted, the levels  of electoral\n\nsupport Party candidates are required  to demonstrate in order to\n\nget on the Party's primary ballot are not high:\n\n          The record shows that there are approximately\n          876,000 registered voters in Maine.  In Maine\n          there  are two Congressional  seats, 35 state\n          senate  seats,  and 151  state representative\n          seats.   If  each electoral  division has  an\n          equal  number of  voters, then  each Congres-\n          sional  district   would  have  approximately\n          438,000  voters,  each state  senate district\n          would have approximately  25,000 voters,  and\n          each state representative district would have\n          approximately 5,800 voters.  The requirements\n          for  primary  petition  signatures for  these\n          three districts  are 1,000, 100  and 25,  re-\n          spectively.  Therefore, the numbers [of Party\n          members' signatures] that an  aspiring Liber-\n          tarian  candidate for each of these positions\n          would need  amount to 0.22%, 0.4%, and 0.43%,\n          respectively,  of  the  registered voters  in\n          each district.\n\n799  F. Supp. at  4.  We  endorse the district  court's view that\n\nthese  signature  requirements  indeed  are modest  in  numerical\n\nterms.

We see the issue somewhat  differ-\n\nently, however.  We  need not decide whether there may be circum-\n\nstances in which significant constitutional problems would result\n\nfrom a regulatory  scheme which precluded  candidate access to  a\n\nparty's ballot by different means  than those under challenge  in\n\nthis case.   If such limits  exist, it suffices to  say that they\n\nhave not been reached under the Maine electoral scheme.  \n\n          First, the  burden about  which the Party  complains is\n\nself-imposed, for the most part.  Under Maine law, a  party which\n\nadopts restrictive membership policies  is not required to assume\n                                                       \n\n\"qualified\" status under   301 et seq.,  or to assume the burdens\n                                      \n\nof the primary nomination requirement imposed by   331.   Indeed,\n\na party can choose to \"disqualify\" itself at any time up to April\n\n15  of an election year, even after submitting the party designa-\n\ntion and  consent of  its 'coattail'  candidate  under    302(1),\n\nmerely  by eschewing  the municipal  caucuses required  by   302-\n\n(3).11   If a party  voluntarily chooses     or  continues     to\n\npursue  the    302 procedure  for  electoral  participation as  a\n\n\"qualified\" party,  it must  be  understood to  have assumed  the\n\n                    \n\n     11The April 15 deadline  occurs two weeks after the  April 1\ndeadline for  primary  candidates to  file  nomination  petitions\nunder   335(8).  Thus,  any new or small party, uncertain  of its\nmembership support,  may withhold the  final certification neces-\nsary  for \"party qualification\"  while it attempts  to enroll the\nmembers  necessary  to nominate  its  candidates  to the  primary\nelection ballot.  If, by April 1, the required membership support\nis  lacking in  one or  more electoral  districts, the  party may\nchoose      simply by  withholding  the  certification of  caucus\nparticipation under   302(3)    to nominate its candidates to the\ngeneral ballot by the \"nomination petition\" procedure  prescribed\nby   351 et seq.\n                \n\n                                21\n\nburden  of maintaining  membership rolls  sufficient to  nominate\n\ncandidates through the primary election process.\n\n          Second, and equally  important, a  party which  chooses\n\nnot to participate  in primary elections  as a \"qualified\"  party\n\nretains  the  option  to  qualify candidates  for  the  statewide\n\nelection  ballot through  the   351 \"nomination  petition\" proce-\n\ndure.  The Party has offered no evidence whatever to suggest that\n\nthis  alternate route to the printed ballot is substantially more\n\nburdensome for a small  party than a primary-qualification proce-\n\ndure.12   In fact,  in the 1992  elections, at least  three inde-\n\npendent candidates for President    Lenora Fulani, H. Ross Perot,\n\nand Howard Phillips    mustered the requisite 4000 signatures and\n\nqualified  by  petition to  be  listed, along  with  their chosen\n\n\"political designation,\" on Maine's  general election ballot.  As\n\nthe  Supreme Court recognized in  Jenness, 403 U.S.  at 441-42, a\n                                         \n\nnomination petition procedure for  ballot access by new  or small\n\npolitical parties is not inherently impermissible, merely because\n\nit is different from the  procedure permitted for larger parties,\n\nprovided  the  procedure imposes  no  undue burden.    \"There are\n\nobvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a\n\n                    \n\n     12Although a \"nomination petition\" requires twice the number\nof signatures a party candidate would be  required to obtain on a\nprimary petition,  see 21-A M.R.S.A.    354(5), these  signatures\n                      \nmay be obtained from any  registered voter, even voters  enrolled\n                        \nin other parties.  Moreover, the number of required signatures is\nstill quite low, compared to the signature requirements upheld as\nreasonable in other contexts by the Supreme Court.  See supra pp.\n                                                             \n18-19.   And a party which mobilizes its efforts toward garnering\nsignatures on  a nomination  petition is spared  \"the Procrustean\nrequirement  of establishing  elaborate primary  election machin-\nery.\"  Jenness, 403 U.S. at 438.\n              \n\n                                22\n\npolitical party  with historically established broad  support, on\n\nthe one hand, and  a new or small  political organization on  the\n\nother.

The  write-in\n\nballot  option ensures that no qualified  primary voter is denied\n\nthe opportunity freely  to vote for the  candidate of his or  her\n\nchoice, and  that  a small  party  which is  unable  to meet  the\n\nminimal membership requirements for listing any candidates on its\n                                               \n\nprimary  ballot, despite \"significant  support\" among the general\n\nelectorate in a particular district, may nonetheless nominate the\n\n                                23\n\ncandidate  who receives  a  plurality of  primary voter  support.\n\nUnity Party v.

However,  in a\nsmall  party primary such as  that involved here,  where no names\n                                                           \nare  printed  on  the  ballot, the  Party's  write-in  candidates\ncompeted  only against  other write-in  candidates; they  did not\ncompete \"head to head\" against established party candidates whose\nprinted names appeared  on the ballot.   In these  circumstances,\nthe  write-in  procedure  imposes  little,  if  any,  comparative\ndisadvantage to small party candidates who are able to muster the\nrequisite electoral support, and any awkwardness in the mechanics\nof  the write-in  process is  adequately counterbalanced,  in our\nview,  by the State's legitimate interests in requiring that such\nsupport be demonstrated.  \n\n                                24\n\n          Under  Maine's election  code, small  political parties\n\nmay choose to \"qualify\"  under the \"sponsorship\" procedure estab-\n\nlished  in    302(1),  postponing  any  showing  of  \"significant\n\ncommunity  support\" under   303,  if the party,  its sponsor, and\n\nits candidates believe they can enroll enough members to meet the\n\nrequirements of primary  ballot access  under   335(5).   If  the\n\nparty is unable  to meet  these requirements  for primary  ballot\n\naccess,  it  may either  (1) draw  on  independent voters  in its\n\nprimary, mustering a qualifying number  of write-in votes for its\n\nparty  candidates,  under   723(1)(A),  or  (2) disqualify itself\n\nunder    302(3),  and  proceed  under  the \"nomination  petition\"\n\nprocess  of   351.

Rather than elect disquali-\n\nfication,  the Party then  chose to muster  independent voters to\n\nits  primary banner under the    338 write-in process.   It again\n\nfailed to show \"significant support.\"  Under these circumstances,\n\nwe  do not believe that appellants' constitutional rights, or the\n\nrights of the  Party's members or other  prospective voters, were\n\nimpermissibly burdened  by the Party's  subsequent exclusion from\n\nthe general election ballot.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                25\n</pre>",
